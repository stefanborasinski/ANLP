The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy 1
One evening of late summer before the nineteenth century had reached onethird of its span a young man and woman the latter carrying a child were approaching the large village of WeydonPriors in Upper Wessex on foot
They were plainly but not ill clad though the thick hoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from an obviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their appearance just now
The man was of fine figure swarthy and stern in aspect and he showed in profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost perpendicular
He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy newer than the remainder of his suit which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn buttons breeches of the same tanned leggings and a straw hat overlaid with black glazed canvas
At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hayknife a wimble for haybonds being also visible in the aperture
His measured springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer while in the turn and plant of each foot there was further a dogged and cynical indifference personal to himself showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds now in the left leg now in the right as he paced along
What was really peculiar however in this couples progress and would have attracted the attention of any casual observer otherwise disposed to overlook them was the perfect silence they preserved
They walked side by side in such a way as to suggest afar off the low easy confidential chat of people full of reciprocity but on closer view it could be discerned that the man was reading or pretending to read a ballad sheet which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the hand that was passed through the basket strap
Whether this apparent cause were the real cause or whether it were an assumed one to escape an intercourse that would have been irksome to him nobody but himself could have said precisely but his taciturnity was unbroken and the woman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence
Virtually she walked the highway alone save for the child she bore
Sometimes the mans bent elbow almost touched her shoulder for she kept as close to his side as was possible without actual contact but she seemed to have no idea of taking his arm nor he of offering it and far from exhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared to receive it as a natural thing
If any word at all were uttered by the little group it was an occasional whisper of the woman to the childa tiny girl in short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarnand the murmured babble of the child in reply
The chiefalmost the onlyattraction of the young womans face was its mobility
When she looked down sideways to the girl she became pretty and even handsome particularly that in the action her features caught slantwise the rays of the strongly coloured sun which made transparencies of her eyelids and nostrils and set fire on her lips
When she plodded on in the shade of the hedge silently thinking she had the hard halfapathetic expression of one who deems anything possible at the hands of Time and Chance except perhaps fair play
The first phase was the work of Nature the second probably of civilization
That the man and woman were husband and wife and the parents of the girl in arms there could be little doubt
No other than such relationship would have accounted for the atmosphere of stale familiarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus as they moved down the road
The wife mostly kept her eyes fixed ahead though with little interestthe scene for that matter being one that might have been matched at almost any spot in any county in England at this time of the year a road neither straight nor crooked neither level nor hilly bordered by hedges trees and other vegetation which had entered the blackenedgreen stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on their way to dingy and yellow and red
The grassy margin of the bank and the nearest hedgerow boughs were powdered by the dust that had been stirred over them by hasty vehicles the same dust as it lay on the road deadening their footfalls like a carpet and this with the aforesaid total absence of conversation allowed every extraneous sound to be heard
For a long time there was none beyond the voice of a weak bird singing a trite old evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the hill at the same hour and with the selfsame trills quavers and breves at any sunset of that season for centuries untold
But as they approached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles reached their ears from some elevated spot in that direction as yet screened from view by foliage
When the outlying houses of Weydon Priors could just be described the family group was met by a turniphoer with his hoe on his shoulder and his dinner bag suspended from it
The reader promptly glanced up
Any trade doing here
he asked phlegmatically designating the village in his van by a wave of the broadsheet
And thinking the labourer did not understand him he added Anything in the haytrussing line
The turniphoer had already begun shaking his head
Why save the man what wisdoms in him that a should come to Weydon for a job of that sort this time o year
Then is there any house to leta little small new cottage just a builded or such like
asked the other
The pessimist still maintained a negative
Pulling down is more the nater of Weydon
There were five houses cleared away last year and three this and the volk nowhere to go no not so much as a thatched hurdle thats the way o WeydonPriors
The haytrusser which he obviously was nodded with some superciliousness
Looking towards the village he continued There is something going on here however is there not
Ay
Tis Fair Day
Though what you hear now is little more than the clatter and scurry of getting away the money o children and fools for the real business is done earlier than this
Ive been working within sound ot all day but I didnt go upnot I
Twas no business of mine
The trusser and his family proceeded on their way and soon entered the Fairfield which showed standingplaces and pens where many hundreds of horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon but were now in great part taken away
At present as their informant had observed but little real business remained on hand the chief being the sale by auction of a few inferior animals that could not otherwise be disposed of and had been absolutely refused by the better class of traders who came and went early
Yet the crowd was denser now than during the morning hours the frivolous contingent of visitors including journeymen out for a holiday a stray soldier or two come on furlough village shopkeepers and the like having latterly flocked in persons whose activities found a congenial field among the peepshows toystands waxworks inspired monsters disinterested medical men who travelled for the public good thimbleriggers nicknack vendors and readers of Fate
Neither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things and they looked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the down
Two which stood nearest to them in the ochreous haze of expiring sunlight seemed almost equally inviting
One was formed of new milkhued canvas and bore red flags on its summit it announced Good Home brewed Beer Ale and Cyder
The other was less new a little iron stovepipe came out of it at the back and in front appeared the placard Good Furmity Sold Hear
The man mentally weighed the two inscriptions and inclined to the former tent
Nonothe other one said the woman
I always like furmity and so does ElizabethJane and so will you
It is nourishing after a long hard day
Ive never tasted it said the man
However he gave way to her representations and they entered the furmity booth forthwith
A rather numerous company appeared within seated at the long narrow tables that ran down the tent on each side
At the upper end stood a stove containing a charcoal fire over which hung a large threelegged crock sufficiently polished round the rim to show that it was made of bell metal
A haggish creature of about fifty presided in a white apron which as it threw an air of respectability over her as far as it extended was made so wide as to reach nearly round her waist
She slowly stirred the contents of the pot
The dull scrape of her large spoon was audible throughout the tent as she thus kept from burning the mixture of corn in the grain flour milk raisins currants and what not that composed the antiquated slop in which she dealt
Vessels holding the separate ingredients stood on a whiteclothed table of boards and trestles close by
The young man and woman ordered a basin each of the mixture steaming hot and sat down to consume it at leisure
This was very well so far for furmity as the woman had said was nourishing and as proper a food as could be obtained within the four seas though to those not accustomed to it the grains of wheat swollen as large as lemonpips which floated on its surface might have a deterrent effect at first
But there was more in that tent than met the cursory glance and the man with the instinct of a perverse character scented it quickly
After a mincing attack on his bowl he watched the hags proceedings from the corner of his eye and saw the game she played
He winked to her and passed up his basin in reply to her nod when she took a bottle from under the table slily measured out a quantity of its contents and tipped the same into the mans furmity
The liquor poured in was rum
The man as slily sent back money in payment
He found the concoction thus strongly laced much more to his satisfaction than it had been in its natural state
His wife had observed the proceeding with much uneasiness but he persuaded her to have hers laced also and she agreed to a milder allowance after some misgiving
The man finished his basin and called for another the rum being signalled for in yet stronger proportion
The effect of it was soon apparent in his manner and his wife but too sadly perceived that in strenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquortent she had only got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers
The child began to prattle impatiently and the wife more than once said to her husband Michael how about our lodging
You know we may have trouble in getting it if we dont go soon
But he turned a deaf ear to those birdlike chirpings
He talked loud to the company
The childs black eyes after slow round ruminating gazes at the candles when they were lighted fell together then they opened then shut again and she slept
At the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity at the second he was jovial at the third argumentative at the fourth the qualities signified by the shape of his face the occasional clench of his mouth and the fiery spark of his dark eye began to tell in his conduct he was overbearingeven brilliantly quarrelsome
The conversation took a high turn as it often does on such occasions
The ruin of good men by bad wives and more particularly the frustration of many a promising youths high aims and hopes and the extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage was the theme
I did for myself that way thoroughly said the trusser with a contemplative bitterness that was wellnight resentful
I married at eighteen like the fool that I was and this is the consequence ot
He pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to bring out the penuriousness of the exhibition
The young woman his wife who seemed accustomed to such remarks acted as if she did not hear them and continued her intermittent private words of tender trifles to the sleeping and waking child who was just big enough to be placed for a moment on the bench beside her when she wished to ease her arms
The man continued I havent more than fifteen shillings in the world and yet I am a good experienced hand in my line
Id challenge England to beat me in the fodder business and if I were a free man again Id be worth a thousand pound before Id done ot
But a fellow never knows these little things till all chance of acting upon em is past
The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be heard saying Now this is the last lotnow wholl take the last lot for a song
Shall I say forty shillings
Tis a very promising broodmare a trifle over five years old and nothing the matter with the hoss at all except that shes a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked out by the kick of another her own sister coming along the road
For my part I dont see why men who have got wives and dont want em shouldnt get rid of em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses said the man in the tent
Why shouldnt they put em up and sell em by auction to men who are in need of such articles
Hey
Why begad Id sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her
Theres them that would do that some of the guests replied looking at the woman who was by no means illfavoured
True said a smoking gentleman whose coat had the fine polish about the collar elbows seams and shoulderblades that longcontinued friction with grimy surfaces will produce and which is usually more desired on furniture than on clothes
From his appearance he had possibly been in former time groom or coachman to some neighbouring county family
Ive had my breedings in as good circles I may say as any man he added and I know true cultivation or nobody do and I can declare shes got itin the bone mind ye I sayas much as any female in the fairthough it may want a little bringing out
Then crossing his legs he resumed his pipe with a nicelyadjusted gaze at a point in the air
The fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected praise of his wife half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude towards the possessor of such qualities
But he speedily lapsed into his former conviction and said harshly Well then now is your chance I am open to an offer for this gem o creation
She turned to her husband and murmured Michael you have talked this nonsense in public places before
A joke is a joke but you may make it once too often mind
I know Ive said it before I meant it
All I want is a buyer
At the moment a swallow one among the last of the season which had by chance found its way through an opening into the upper part of the tent flew to and from quick curves above their heads causing all eyes to follow it absently
In watching the bird till it made its escape the assembled company neglected to respond to the workmans offer and the subject dropped
But a quarter of an hour later the man who had gone on lacing his furmity more and more heavily though he was either so strongminded or such an intrepid toper that he still appeared fairly sober recurred to the old strain as in a musical fantasy the instrument fetches up the original theme
HereI am waiting to know about this offer of mine
The woman is no good to me
Wholl have her
The company had by this time decidedly degenerated and the renewed inquiry was received with a laugh of appreciation
The woman whispered she was imploring and anxious Come come it is getting dark and this nonsense wont do
If you dont come along I shall go without you
Come
She waited and waited yet he did not move
In ten minutes the man broke in upon the desultory conversation of the furmity drinkers with
I asked this question and nobody answered to t
Will any Jack Rag or Tom Straw among ye buy my goods
The womans manner changed and her face assumed the grim shape and colour of which mention has been made
Mike Mike she said this is getting serious
Otoo serious
Will anybody buy her
said the man
I wish somebody would said she firmly
Her present owner is not at all to her liking
Nor you to mine said he
So we are agreed about that
Gentlemen you hear
Its an agreement to part
She shall take the girl if she wants to and go her ways
Ill take my tools and go my ways
Tis simple as Scripture history
Now then stand up Susan and show yourself
Dont my chiel whispered a buxom staylace dealer in voluminous petticoats who sat near the woman yer good man dont know what hes saying
The woman however did stand up
Now whos auctioneer
cried the haytrusser
I be promptly answered a short man with a nose resembling a copper knob a damp voice and eyes like buttonholes
Wholl make an offer for this lady
The woman looked on the ground as if she maintained her position by a supreme effort of will
Five shillings said someone at which there was a laugh
No insults said the husband
Wholl say a guinea
Nobody answered and the female dealer in staylaces interposed
Behave yerself moral good man for Heavens love
Ah what a cruelty is the poor soul married to
Bed and board is dear at some figures pon my vation tis
Set it higher auctioneer said the trusser
Two guineas
said the auctioneer and no one replied
If they dont take her for that in ten seconds theyll have to give more said the husband
Very well
Now auctioneer add another
Three guineasgoing for three guineas
said the rheumy man
No bid
said the husband
Good Lord why shes cost me fifty times the money if a penny
Go on
Four guineas
cried the auctioneer
Ill tell ye whatI wont sell her for less than five said the husband bringing down his fist so that the basins danced
Ill sell her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money and treat her well and he shall have her for ever and never hear aught o me
But she shant go for less
Now thenfive guineasand shes yours
Susan you agree
She bowed her head with absolute indifference
Five guineas said the auctioneer or shell be withdrawn
Do anybody give it
The last time
Yes or no
Yes said a loud voice from the doorway
All eyes were turned
Standing in the triangular opening which formed the door of the tent was a sailor who unobserved by the rest had arrived there within the last two or three minutes
A dead silence followed his affirmation
You say you do
asked the husband staring at him
I say so replied the sailor
Saying is one thing and paying is another
Wheres the money
The sailor hesitated a moment looked anew at the woman came in unfolded five crisp pieces of paper and threw them down upon the tablecloth
They were BankofEngland notes for five pounds
Upon the face of this he clinked down the shillings severallyone two three four five
The sight of real money in full amount in answer to a challenge for the same till then deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon the spectators
Their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief actors and then upon the notes as they lay weighted by the shillings on the table
Up to this moment it could not positively have been asserted that the man in spite of his tantalizing declaration was really in earnest
The spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece of mirthful irony carried to extremes and had assumed that being out of work he was as a consequence out of temper with the world and society and his nearest kin
But with the demand and response of real cash the jovial frivolity of the scene departed
A lurid colour seemed to fill the tent and change the aspect of all therein
The mirthwrinkles left the listeners faces and they waited with parting lips
Now said the woman breaking the silence so that her low dry voice sounded quite loud before you go further Michael listen to me
If you touch that money I and this girl go with the man
Mind it is a joke no longer
A joke
Of course it is not a joke
shouted her husband his resentment rising at her suggestion
I take the money the sailor takes you
Thats plain enough
It has been done elsewhereand why not here
Tis quite on the understanding that the young woman is willing said the sailor blandly
I wouldnt hurt her feelings for the world
Faith nor I said her husband
But she is willing provided she can have the child
She said so only the other day when I talked ot
That you swear
said the sailor to her
I do said she after glancing at her husbands face and seeing no repentance there
Very well she shall have the child and the bargains complete said the trusser
He took the sailors notes and deliberately folded them and put them with the shillings in a high remote pocket with an air of finality
The sailor looked at the woman and smiled
Come along
he said kindly
The little one toothe more the merrier
She paused for an instant with a close glance at him
Then dropping her eyes again and saying nothing she took up the child and followed him as he made towards the door
On reaching it she turned and pulling off her weddingring flung it across the booth in the haytrussers face
Mike she said Ive lived with thee a couple of years and had nothing but temper
Now Im no more to ee Ill try my luck elsewhere
Twill be better for me and Elizabeth Jane both
So goodbye
Seizing the sailors arm with her right hand and mounting the little girl on her left she went out of the tent sobbing bitterly
A stolid look of concern filled the husbands face as if after all he had not quite anticipated this ending and some of the guests laughed
Is she gone
he said
Faith ay
shes gone clane enough said some rustics near the door
He rose and walked to the entrance with the careful tread of one conscious of his alcoholic load
Some others followed and they stood looking into the twilight
The difference between the peacefulness of inferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent at this place
In contrast with the harshness of the act just ended within the tent was the sight of several horses crossing their necks and rubbing each other lovingly as they waited in patience to be harnessed for the homeward journey
Outside the fair in the valleys and woods all was quiet
The sun had recently set and the west heaven was hung with rosy cloud which seemed permanent yet slowly changed
To watch it was like looking at some grand feat of stagery from a darkened auditorium
In presence of this scene after the other there was a natural instinct to abjure man as the blot on an otherwise kindly universe till it was remembered that all terrestrial conditions were intermittent and that mankind might some night be innocently sleeping when these quiet objects were raging loud
Where do the sailor live
asked a spectator when they had vainly gazed around
God knows that replied the man who had seen high life
Hes without doubt a stranger here
He came in about five minutes ago said the furmity woman joining the rest with her hands on her hips
And then a stepped back and then a looked in again
Im not a penny the better for him
Serves the husband well beright said the staylace vendor
A comely respectable body like herwhat can a man want more
I glory in the womans sperrit
Id ha done it myselfod send if I wouldnt if a husband had behaved so to me
Id go and a might call and call till his keacorn was raw but Id never come backno not till the great trumpet would I
Well the woman will be better off said another of a more deliberative turn
For seafaring natures be very good shelter for shorn lambs and the man do seem to have plenty of money which is what shes not been used to lately by all showings
Mark meIll not go after her
said the trusser returning doggedly to his seat
Let her go
If shes up to such vagaries she must suffer for em
Shed no business to take the maidtis my maid and if it were the doing again she shouldnt have her
Perhaps from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible proceeding perhaps because it was late the customers thinned away from the tent shortly after this episode
The man stretched his elbows forward on the table leant his face upon his arms and soon began to snore
The furmity seller decided to close for the night and after seeing the rumbottles milk corn raisins etc that remained on hand loaded into the cart came to where the man reclined
She shook him but could not wake him
As the tent was not to be struck that night the fair continuing for two or three days she decided to let the sleeper who was obviously no tramp stay where he was and his basket with him
Extinguishing the last candle and lowering the flap of the tent she left it and drove away
2
The morning sun was streaming through the crevices of the canvas when the man awoke
A warm glow pervaded the whole atmosphere of the marquee and a single big blue fly buzzed musically round and round it
Besides the buzz of the fly there was not a sound
He looked aboutat the benchesat the table supported by trestlesat his basket of toolsat the stove where the furmity had been boiledat the empty basinsat some shed grains of wheatat the corks which dotted the grassy floor
Among the odds and ends he discerned a little shining object and picked it up
It was his wifes ring
A confused picture of the events of the previous evening seemed to come back to him and he thrust his hand into his breastpocket
A rustling revealed the sailors banknotes thrust carelessly in
This second verification of his dim memories was enough he knew now they were not dreams
He remained seated looking on the ground for some time
I must get out of this as soon as I can he said deliberately at last with the air of one who could not catch his thoughts without pronouncing them
Shes goneto be sure she isgone with that sailor who bought her and little ElizabethJane
We walked here and I had the furmity and rum in itand sold her
Yes thats whats happened and here am I
Now what am I to do am I sober enough to walk I wonder
He stood up found that he was in fairly good condition for progress unencumbered
Next he shouldered his tool basket and found he could carry it
Then lifting the tent door he emerged into the open air
Here the man looked around with gloomy curiosity
The freshness of the September morning inspired and braced him as he stood
He and his family had been weary when they arrived the night before and they had observed but little of the place so that he now beheld it as a new thing
It exhibited itself as the top of an open down bounded on one extreme by a plantation and approached by a winding road
At the bottom stood the village which lent its name to the upland and the annual fair that was held thereon
The spot stretched downward into valleys and onward to other uplands dotted with barrows and trenched with the remains of prehistoric forts
The whole scene lay under the rays of a newly risen sun which had not as yet dried a single blade of the heavily dewed grass whereon the shadows of the yellow and red vans were projected far away those thrown by the felloe of each wheel being elongated in shape to the orbit of a comet
All the gipsies and showmen who had remained on the ground lay snug within their carts and tents or wrapped in horsecloths under them and were silent and still as death with the exception of an occasional snore that revealed their presence
But the Seven Sleepers had a dog and dogs of the mysterious breeds that vagrants own that are as much like cats as dogs and as much like foxes as cats also lay about here
A little one started up under one of the carts barked as a matter of principle and quickly lay down again
He was the only positive spectator of the haytrussers exit from the Weydon Fairfield
This seemed to accord with his desire
He went on in silent thought unheeding the yellowhammers which flitted about the hedges with straws in their bills the crowns of the mushrooms and the tinkling of local sheepbells whose wearer had had the good fortune not to be included in the fair
When he reached a lane a good mile from the scene of the previous evening the man pitched his basket and leant upon a gate
A difficult problem or two occupied his mind
Did I tell my name to anybody last night or didnt I tell my name
he said to himself and at last concluded that he did not
His general demeanour was enough to show how he was surprised and nettled that his wife had taken him so literallyas much could be seen in his face and in the way he nibbled a straw which he pulled from the hedge
He knew that she must have been somewhat excited to do this moreover she must have believed that there was some sort of binding force in the transaction
On this latter point he felt almost certain knowing her freedom from levity of character and the extreme simplicity of her intellect
There may too have been enough recklessness and resentment beneath her ordinary placidity to make her stifle any momentary doubts
On a previous occasion when he had declared during a fuddle that he would dispose of her as he had done she had replied that she would not hear him say that many times more before it happened in the resigned tones of a fatalistYet she knows I am not in my senses when I do that
he exclaimed
Well I must walk about till I find herSeize her why didnt she know better than bring me into this disgrace
he roared out
She wasnt queer if I was
Tis like Susan to show such idiotic simplicity
Meekthat meekness has done me more harm than the bitterest temper
When he was calmer he turned to his original conviction that he must somehow find her and his little ElizabethJane and put up with the shame as best he could
It was of his own making and he ought to bear it
But first he resolved to register an oath a greater oath than he had ever sworn before and to do it properly he required a fit place and imagery for there was something fetichistic in this mans beliefs
He shouldered his basket and moved on casting his eyes inquisitively round upon the landscape as he walked and at the distance of three or four miles perceived the roofs of a village and the tower of a church
He instantly made towards the latter object
The village was quite still it being that motionless hour of rustic daily life which fills the interval between the departure of the fieldlabourers to their work and the rising of their wives and daughters to prepare the breakfast for their return
Hence he reached the church without observation and the door being only latched he entered
The haytrusser deposited his basket by the font went up the nave till he reached the altarrails and opening the gate entered the sacrarium where he seemed to feel a sense of the strangeness for a moment then he knelt upon the footpace
Dropping his head upon the clamped book which lay on the Communiontable he said aloud I Michael Henchard on this morning of the sixteenth of September do take an oath before God here in this solemn place that I will avoid all strong liquors for the space of twentyone years to come being a year for every year that I have lived
And this I swear upon the book before me and may I be strook dumb blind and helpless if I break this my oath
When he had said it and kissed the big book the haytrusser arose and seemed relieved at having made a start in a new direction
While standing in the porch a moment he saw a thick jet of wood smoke suddenly start up from the red chimney of a cottage near and knew that the occupant had just lit her fire
He went round to the door and the housewife agreed to prepare him some breakfast for a trifling payment which was done
Then he started on the search for his wife and child
The perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough
Though he examined and inquired and walked hither and thither day after day no such characters as those he described had anywhere been seen since the evening of the fair
To add to the difficulty he could gain no sound of the sailors name
As money was short with him he decided after some hesitation to spend the sailors money in the prosecution of this search but it was equally in vain
The truth was that a certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from following up the investigation with the loud hueandcry such a pursuit demanded to render it effectual and it was probably for this reason that he obtained no clue though everything was done by him that did not involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her
Weeks counted up to months and still he searched on maintaining himself by small jobs of work in the intervals
By this time he had arrived at a seaport and there he derived intelligence that persons answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time before
Then he said he would search no longer and that he would go and settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind
Next day he started journeying southwestward and did not pause except for nights lodgings till he reached the town of Casterbridge in a far distant part of Wessex

The highroad into the village of WeydonPriors was again carpeted with dust
The trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green and where the Henchard family of three had once walked along two persons not unconnected with the family walked now
The scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character even to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down that it might for that matter have been the afternoon following the previously recorded episode
Change was only to be observed in details but here it was obvious that a long procession of years had passed by
One of the two who walked the road was she who had figured as the young wife of Henchard on the previous occasion now her face had lost much of its rotundity her skin had undergone a textural change and though her hair had not lost colour it was considerably thinner than heretofore
She was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow
Her companion also in black appeared as a well formed young woman about eighteen completely possessed of that ephemeral precious essence youth which is itself beauty irrespective of complexion or contour
A glance was sufficient to inform the eye that this was Susan Henchards grownup daughter
While lifes middle summer had set its hardening mark on the mothers face her former springlike specialities were transferred so dexterously by Time to the second figure her child that the absence of certain facts within her mothers knowledge from the girls mind would have seemed for the moment to one reflecting on those facts to be a curious imperfection in Natures powers of continuity
They walked with joined hands and it could be perceived that this was the act of simple affection
The daughter carried in her outer hand a withy basket of oldfashioned make the mother a blue bundle which contrasted oddly with her black stuff gown
Reaching the outskirts of the village they pursued the same track as formerly and ascended to the fair
Here too it was evident that the years had told
Certain mechanical improvements might have been noticed in the roundabouts and highfliers machines for testing rustic strength and weight and in the erections devoted to shooting for nuts
But the real business of the fair had considerably dwindled
The new periodical great markets of neighbouring towns were beginning to interfere seriously with the trade carried on here for centuries
The pens for sheep the tieropes for horses were about half as long as they had been
The stalls of tailors hosiers coopers linendrapers and other such trades had almost disappeared and the vehicles were far less numerous
The mother and daughter threaded the crowd for some little distance and then stood still
Why did we hinder our time by coming in here
I thought you wished to get onward
said the maiden
Yes my dear ElizabethJane explained the other
But I had a fancy for looking up here
Why
It was here I first met with Newsonon such a day as this
First met with father here
Yes you have told me so before
And now hes drowned and gone from us
As she spoke the girl drew a card from her pocket and looked at it with a sigh
It was edged with black and inscribed within a design resembling a mural tablet were the words In affectionate memory of Richard Newson mariner who was unfortunately lost at sea in the month of November 184 aged fortyone years
And it was here continued her mother with more hesitation that I last saw the relation we are going to look forMr Michael Henchard
What is his exact kin to us mother
I have never clearly had it told me
He is or wasfor he may be deada connection by marriage said her mother deliberately
Thats exactly what you have said a score of times before
replied the young woman looking about her inattentively
Hes not a near relation I suppose
Not by any means
He was a haytrusser wasnt he when you last heard of him
He was
I suppose he never knew me
the girl innocently continued
Mrs Henchard paused for a moment and answered uneasily Of course not ElizabethJane
But come this way
She moved on to another part of the field
It is not much use inquiring here for anybody I should think the daughter observed as she gazed round about
People at fairs change like the leaves of trees and I daresay you are the only one here today who was here all those years ago
I am not so sure of that said Mrs Newson as she now called herself keenly eyeing something under a green bank a little way off
See there
The daughter looked in the direction signified
The object pointed out was a tripod of sticks stuck into the earth from which hung a threelegged crock kept hot by a smouldering wood fire beneath
Over the pot stooped an old woman haggard wrinkled and almost in rags
She stirred the contents of the pot with a large spoon and occasionally croaked in a broken voice Good furmity sold here
It was indeed the former mistress of the furmity tentonce thriving cleanly whiteaproned and chinking with money now tentless dirty owning no tables or benches and having scarce any customers except two small whitybrown boys who came up and asked for A haporth pleasegood measure which she served in a couple of chipped yellow basins of commonest clay
She was here at that time resumed Mrs Newson making a step as if to draw nearer
Dont speak to herit isnt respectable
urged the other
I will just say a wordyou ElizabethJane can stay here
The girl was not loth and turned to some stalls of coloured prints while her mother went forward
The old woman begged for the latters custom as soon as she saw her and responded to Mrs HenchardNewsons request for a penny worth with more alacrity than she had shown in selling six pennyworths in her younger days
When the soidisant widow had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction of the former time the hag opened a little basket behind the fire and looking up slily whispered Just a thought o rum in itsmuggled you knowsay two pennorthtwill make it slip down like cordial
Her customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick and shook her head with a meaning the old woman was far from translating
She pretended to eat a little of the furmity with the leaden spoon offered and as she did so said blandly to the hag Youve seen better days
Ah maamwell ye may say it
responded the old woman opening the sluices of her heart forthwith
Ive stood in this fairground maid wife and widow these nineand thirty years and in that time have known what it was to do business with the richest stomachs in the land
Maam youd hardly believe that I was once the owner of a great paviliontent that was the attraction of the fair
Nobody could come nobody could go without having a dish of Mrs Goodenoughs furmity
I knew the clergys taste the dandy gents taste I knew the towns taste the countrys taste
I even knowed the taste of the coarse shameless females
But Lords my lifethe worlds no memory straightforward dealings dont bring profittis the sly and the underhand that get on in these times
Mrs Newson glanced roundher daughter was still bending over the distant stalls
Can you call to mind she said cautiously to the old woman the sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years ago today
The hag reflected and half shook her head
If it had been a big thing I should have minded it in a moment she said
I can mind every serious fight o married parties every murder every manslaughter even every pocketpicking leastwise large onesthat t has been my lot to witness
But a selling
Was it done quietlike
Well yes
I think so
The furmity woman half shook her head again
And yet she said I do
At any rate I can mind a man doing something o the sorta man in a cord jacket with a basket of tools but Lord bless ye we dont gie it headroom we dont such as that
The only reason why I can mind the man is that he came back here to the next years fair and told me quite privatelike that if a woman ever asked for him I was to say he had gone towhereCasterbridgeyesto Casterbridge said he
But Lords my life I shouldnt ha thought of it again
Mrs Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small means afforded had she not discreetly borne in mind that it was by that unscrupulous persons liquor her husband had been degraded
She briefly thanked her informant and rejoined Elizabeth who greeted her with Mother do lets get onit was hardly respectable for you to buy refreshments there
I see none but the lowest do
I have learned what I wanted however said her mother quietly
The last time our relative visited this fair he said he was living at Casterbridge
It is a long long way from here and it was many years ago that he said it but there I think well go
With this they descended out of the fair and went onward to the village where they obtained a nights lodging

Henchards wife acted for the best but she had involved herself in difficulties
A hundred times she had been upon the point of telling her daughter ElizabethJane the true story of her life the tragical crisis of which had been the transaction at Weydon Fair when she was not much older than the girl now beside her
But she had refrained
An innocent maiden had thus grown up in the belief that the relations between the genial sailor and her mother were the ordinary ones that they had always appeared to be
The risk of endangering a childs strong affection by disturbing ideas which had grown with her growth was to Mrs Henchard too fearful a thing to contemplate
It had seemed indeed folly to think of making ElizabethJane wise
But Susan Henchards fear of losing her dearly loved daughters heart by a revelation had little to do with any sense of wrongdoing on her own part
Her simplicitythe original ground of Henchards contempt for herhad allowed her to live on in the conviction that Newson had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his purchase though the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were vague
It may seem strange to sophisticated minds that a sane young matron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer and were there not numerous other instances of the same belief the thing might scarcely be credited
But she was by no means the first or last peasant woman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser as too many rural records show
The history of Susan Henchards adventures in the interim can be told in two or three sentences
Absolutely helpless she had been taken off to Canada where they had lived several years without any great worldly success though she worked as hard as any woman could to keep their cottage cheerful and wellprovided
When ElizabethJane was about twelve years old the three returned to England and settled at Falmouth where Newson made a living for a few years as boatman and general handy shoreman
He then engaged in the Newfoundland trade and it was during this period that Susan had an awakening
A friend to whom she confided her history ridiculed her grave acceptance of her position and all was over with her peace of mind
When Newson came home at the end of one winter he saw that the delusion he had so carefully sustained had vanished for ever
There was then a time of sadness in which she told him her doubts if she could live with him longer
Newson left home again on the Newfoundland trade when the season came round
The vague news of his loss at sea a little later on solved a problem which had become torture to her meek conscience
She saw him no more
Of Henchard they heard nothing
To the liege subjects of Labour the England of those days was a continent and a mile a geographical degree
ElizabethJane developed early into womanliness
One day a month or so after receiving intelligence of Newsons death off the Bank of Newfoundland when the girl was about eighteen she was sitting on a willow chair in the cottage they still occupied working twine nets for the fishermen
Her mother was in a back corner of the same room engaged in the same labour and dropping the heavy wood needle she was filling she surveyed her daughter thoughtfully
The sun shone in at the door upon the young womans head and hair which was worn loose so that the rays streamed into its depths as into a hazel copse
Her face though somewhat wan and incomplete possessed the raw materials of beauty in a promising degree
There was an underhandsomeness in it struggling to reveal itself through the provisional curves of immaturity and the casual disfigurements that resulted from the straitened circumstances of their lives
She was handsome in the bone hardly as yet handsome in the flesh
She possibly might never be fully handsome unless the carking accidents of her daily existence could be evaded before the mobile parts of her countenance had settled to their final mould
The sight of the girl made her mother sadnot vaguely but by logical inference
They both were still in that strait waistcoat of poverty from which she had tried so many times to be delivered for the girls sake
The woman had long perceived how zealously and constantly the young mind of her companion was struggling for enlargement and yet now in her eighteenth year it still remained but little unfolded
The desiresober and repressedof ElizabethJanes heart was indeed to see to hear and to understand
How could she become a woman of wider knowledge higher repute better as she termed itthis was her constant inquiry of her mother
She sought further into things than other girls in her position ever did and her mother groaned as she felt she could not aid in the search
The sailor drowned or no was probably now lost to them and Susans staunch religious adherence to him as her husband in principle till her views had been disturbed by enlightenment was demanded no more
She asked herself whether the present moment now that she was a free woman again were not as opportune a one as she would find in a world where everything had been so inopportune for making a desperate effort to advance Elizabeth
To pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed wisely or not the best initiatory step
He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb
But he might on the other hand have had too much sense to do so for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only and was not a habitual drunkard
At any rate the propriety of returning to him if he lived was unquestionable
The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening Elizabeth a proceeding which her mother could not endure to contemplate
She finally resolved to undertake the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard leaving it to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end
This will account for their conversation at the fair and the halfinformed state at which Elizabeth was led onward
In this attitude they proceeded on their journey trusting solely to the dim light afforded of Henchards whereabouts by the furmity woman
The strictest economy was indispensable
Sometimes they might have been seen on foot sometimes on farmers waggons sometimes in carriers vans and thus they drew near to Casterbridge
ElizabethJane discovered to her alarm that her mothers health was not what it once had been and there was ever and anon in her talk that renunciatory tone which showed that but for the girl she would not be very sorry to quit a life she was growing thoroughly weary of
It was on a Friday evening near the middle of September and just before dusk that they reached the summit of a hill within a mile of the place they sought
There were high banked hedges to the coachroad here and they mounted upon the green turf within and sat down
The spot commanded a full view of the town and its environs
What an oldfashioned place it seems to be
said ElizabethJane while her silent mother mused on other things than topography
It is huddled all together and it is shut in by a square wall of trees like a plot of garden ground by a boxedging
Its squareness was indeed the characteristic which most struck the eye in this antiquated borough the borough of Casterbridgeat that time recent as it was untouched by the faintest sprinkle of modernism
It was compact as a box of dominoes
It had no suburbsin the ordinary sense
Country and town met at a mathematical line
To birds of the more soaring kind Casterbridge must have appeared on this fine evening as a mosaicwork of subdued reds browns greys and crystals held together by a rectangular frame of deep green
To the level eye of humanity it stood as an indistinct mass behind a dense stockade of limes and chestnuts set in the midst of miles of rotund down and concave field
The mass became gradually dissected by the vision into towers gables chimneys and casements the highest glazings shining bleared and bloodshot with the coppery fire they caught from the belt of sunlit cloud in the west
From the centre of each side of this treebound square ran avenues east west and south into the wide expanse of corn land and coomb to the distance of a mile or so
It was by one of these avenues that the pedestrians were about to enter
Before they had risen to proceed two men passed outside the hedge engaged in argumentative conversation
Why surely said Elizabeth as they receded those men mentioned the name of Henchard in their talkthe name of our relative
I thought so too said Mrs Newson
That seems a hint to us that he is still here
Yes
Shall I run after them and ask them about him No no no
Not for the world just yet
He may be in the workhouse or in the stocks for all we know
Dear mewhy should you think that mother
Twas just something to saythats all
But we must make private inquiries
Having sufficiently rested they proceeded on their way at evenfall
The dense trees of the avenue rendered the road dark as a tunnel though the open land on each side was still under a faint daylight in other words they passed down a midnight between two gloamings
The features of the town had a keen interest for Elizabeths mother now that the human side came to the fore
As soon as they had wandered about they could see that the stockade of gnarled trees which framed in Casterbridge was itself an avenue standing on a low green bank or escarpment with a ditch yet visible without
Within the avenue and bank was a wall more or less discontinuous and within the wall were packed the abodes of the burghers
Though the two women did not know it these external features were but the ancient defences of the town planted as a promenade
The lamplights now glimmered through the engirdling trees conveying a sense of great smugness and comfort inside and rendering at the same time the unlighted country without strangely solitary and vacant in aspect considering its nearness to life
The difference between burgh and champaign was increased too by sounds which now reached them above othersthe notes of a brass band
The travellers returned into the High Street where there were timber houses with overhanging stories whose smallpaned lattices were screened by dimity curtains on a drawing string and under whose bargeboards old cobwebs waved in the breeze
There were houses of bricknogging which derived their chief support from those adjoining
There were slate roofs patched with tiles and tile roofs patched with slate with occasionally a roof of thatch
The agricultural and pastoral character of the people upon whom the town depended for its existence was shown by the class of objects displayed in the shop windows
Scythes reaphooks sheepshears billhooks spades mattocks and hoes at the ironmongers beehives butterfirkins churns milking stools and pails hayrakes fieldflagons and seedlips at the coopers cartropes and ploughharness at the saddlers carts wheelbarrows and millgear at the wheelwrights and machinists horseembrocations at the chemists at the glovers and leathercutters hedging gloves thatchers kneecaps ploughmens leggings villagers pattens and clogs
They came to a grizzled church whose massive square tower rose unbroken into the darkening sky the lower parts being illuminated by the nearest lamps sufficiently to show how completely the mortar from the joints of the stonework had been nibbled out by time and weather which had planted in the crevices thus made little tufts of stonecrop and grass almost as far up as the very battlements
From this tower the clock struck eight and thereupon a bell began to toll with a peremptory clang
The curfew was still rung in Casterbridge and it was utilized by the inhabitants as a signal for shutting their shops
No sooner did the deep notes of the bell throb between the housefronts than a clatter of shutters arose through the whole length of the High Street
In a few minutes business at Casterbridge was ended for the day
Other clocks struck eight from time to timeone gloomily from the gaol another from the gable of an almshouse with a preparative creak of machinery more audible than the note of the bell a row of tall varnished caseclocks from the interior of a clockmakers shop joined in one after another just as the shutters were enclosing them like a row of actors delivering their final speeches before the fall of the curtain then chimes were heard stammering out the Sicilian Mariners Hymn so that chronologists of the advanced school were appreciably on their way to the next hour before the whole business of the old one was satisfactorily wound up
In an open space before the church walked a woman with her gownsleeves rolled up so high that the edge of her underlinen was visible and her skirt tucked up through her pocket hole
She carried a load under her arm from which she was pulling pieces of bread and handing them to some other women who walked with her which pieces they nibbled critically
The sight reminded Mrs HenchardNewson and her daughter that they had an appetite and they inquired of the woman for the nearest bakers
Ye may as well look for mannafood as good bread in Casterbridge just now she said after directing them
They can blare their trumpets and thump their drums and have their roaring dinnerswaving her hand towards a point further along the street where the brass band could be seen standing in front of an illuminated buildingbut we must needs be putto for want of a wholesome crust
Theres less good bread than good beer in Casterbridge now
And less good beer than swipes said a man with his hands in his pockets
How does it happen theres no good bread
asked Mrs Henchard
Oh tis the cornfactorhes the man that our millers and bakers all deal wi and he has sold em growed wheat which they didnt know was growed so they SAY till the dough ran all over the ovens like quicksilver so that the loaves be as fiat as toads and like suet pudden inside
Ive been a wife and Ive been a mother and I never see such unprincipled bread in Casterbridge as this beforeBut you must be a real stranger here not to know whats made all the poor volks insides plim like blowed bladders this week
I am said Elizabeths mother shyly
Not wishing to be observed further till she knew more of her future in this place she withdrew with her daughter from the speakers side
Getting a couple of biscuits at the shop indicated as a temporary substitute for a meal they next bent their steps instinctively to where the music was playing
5
A few score yards brought them to the spot where the town band was now shaking the windowpanes with the strains of The Roast Beef of Old England
The building before whose doors they had pitched their musicstands was the chief hotel in Casterbridgenamely the Kings Arms
A spacious bowwindow projected into the street over the main portico and from the open sashes came the babble of voices the jingle of glasses and the drawing of corks
The blinds moreover being left unclosed the whole interior of this room could be surveyed from the top of a flight of stone steps to the roadwaggon office opposite for which reason a knot of idlers had gathered there
We might perhaps after all make a few inquiries about our relation Mr Henchard whispered Mrs Newson who since her entry into Casterbridge had seemed strangely weak and agitated And this I think would be a good place for trying itjust to ask you know how he stands in the town if he is here as I think he must be
You ElizabethJane had better be the one to do it
Im too worn out to do anythingpull down your fall first
She sat down upon the lowest step and ElizabethJane obeyed her directions and stood among the idlers
Whats going on tonight
asked the girl after singling out an old man and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of converse
Well ye must be a stranger sure said the old man without taking his eyes from the window
Why tis a great public dinner of the gentlepeople and such like leading volkwi the Mayor in the chair
As we plainer fellows baint invited they leave the windershutters open that we may get jist a sense ot out here
If you mount the steps you can see em
Thats Mr Henchard the Mayor at the end of the table a facing ye and thats the Council men right and leftAh lots of them when they begun life were no more than I be now
Henchard
said ElizabethJane surprised but by no means suspecting the whole force of the revelation
She ascended to the top of the steps
Her mother though her head was bowed had already caught from the innwindow tones that strangely riveted her attention before the old mans words Mr Henchard the Mayor reached her ears
She arose and stepped up to her daughters side as soon as she could do so without showing exceptional eagerness
The interior of the hotel diningroom was spread out before her with its tables and glass and plate and inmates
Facing the window in the chair of dignity sat a man about forty years of age of heavy frame large features and commanding voice his general build being rather coarse than compact
He had a rich complexion which verged on swarthiness a flashing black eye and dark bushy brows and hair
When he indulged in an occasional loud laugh at some remark among the guests his large mouth parted so far back as to show to the rays of the chandelier a full score or more of the twoandthirty sound white teeth that he obviously still could boast of
That laugh was not encouraging to strangers and hence it may have been well that it was rarely heard
Many theories might have been built upon it
It fell in well with conjectures of a temperament which would have no pity for weakness but would be ready to yield ungrudging admiration to greatness and strength
Its producers personal goodness if he had any would be of a very fitful castan occasional almost oppressive generosity rather than a mild and constant kindness
Susan Henchards husbandin law at leastsat before them matured in shape stiffened in line exaggerated in traits disciplined thoughtmarkedin a word older
Elizabeth encumbered with no recollections as her mother was regarded him with nothing more than the keen curiosity and interest which the discovery of such unexpected social standing in the longsought relative naturally begot
He was dressed in an oldfashioned evening suit an expanse of frilled shirt showing on his broad breast jewelled studs and a heavy gold chain
Three glasses stood at his right hand but to his wifes surprise the two for wine were empty while the third a tumbler was half full of water
When last she had seen him he was sitting in a corduroy jacket fustian waistcoat and breeches and tanned leather leggings with a basin of hot furmity before him
Time the magician had wrought much here
Watching him and thus thinking of past days she became so moved that she shrank back against the jamb of the waggonoffice doorway to which the steps gave access the shadow from it conveniently hiding her features
She forgot her daughter till a touch from ElizabethJane aroused her
Have you seen him mother
whispered the girl
Yes yes answered her companion hastily
I have seen him and it is enough for me
Now I only want to gopass awaydie
WhyO what
She drew closer and whispered in her mothers ear Does he seem to you not likely to befriend us
I thought he looked a generous man
What a gentleman he is isnt he
and how his diamond studs shine
How strange that you should have said he might be in the stocks or in the workhouse or dead
Did ever anything go more by contraries
Why do you feel so afraid of him
I am not at allIll call upon himhe can but say he dont own such remote kin
I dont know at allI cant tell what to set about
I feel so down
Dont be that mother now we have got here and all
Rest there where you be a little whileI will look on and find out more about him
I dont think I can ever meet Mr Henchard
He is not how I thought he would behe overpowers me
I dont wish to see him any more
But wait a little time and consider
ElizabethJane had never been so much interested in anything in her life as in their present position partly from the natural elation she felt at discovering herself akin to a coach and she gazed again at the scene
The younger guests were talking and eating with animation their elders were searching for titbits and sniffing and grunting over their plates like sows nuzzling for acorns
Three drinks seemed to be sacred to the companyport sherry and rum outside which oldestablished trinity few or no palates ranged
A row of ancient rummers with ground figures on their sides and each primed with a spoon was now placed down the table and these were promptly filled with grog at such high temperatures as to raise serious considerations for the articles exposed to its vapours
But ElizabethJane noticed that though this filling went on with great promptness up and down the table nobody filled the Mayors glass who still drank large quantities of water from the tumbler behind the clump of crystal vessels intended for wine and spirits
They dont fill Mr Henchards wineglasses she ventured to say to her elbow acquaintance the old man
Ah no dont ye know him to be the celebrated abstaining worthy of that name
He scorns all tempting liquors never touches nothing
O yes heve strong qualities that way
I have heard tell that he sware a gospel oath in bygone times and has bode by it ever since
So they dont press him knowing it would be unbecoming in the face of that for yer gospel oath is a serious thing
Another elderly man hearing this discourse now joined in by inquiring How much longer have he got to suffer from it Solomon Longways
Another two year they say
I dont know the why and the wherefore of his fixing such a time for a never has told anybody
But tis exactly two calendar years longer they say
A powerful mind to hold out so long
TrueBut theres great strength in hope
Knowing that in fourandtwenty months time yell be out of your bondage and able to make up for all youve suffered by partaking without stintwhy it keeps a man up no doubt
No doubt Christopher Coney no doubt
And a must need such reflectionsa lonely widow man said Longways
When did he lose his wife
asked Elizabeth
I never knowed her
Twas afore he came to Casterbridge Solomon Longways replied with terminative emphasis as if the fact of his ignorance of Mrs Henchard were sufficient to deprive her history of all interest
But I know that as a banded teetotaller and that if any of his men be ever so little overtook by a drop hes down upon em as stern as the Lord upon the jovial Jews
Has he many men then
said ElizabethJane
Many
Why my good maid hes the powerfullest member of the Town Council and quite a principal man in the country round besides
Never a big dealing in wheat barley oats hay roots and suchlike but Henchards got a hand in it
Ay and hell go into other things too and thats where he makes his mistake
He worked his way up from nothing when a came here and now hes a pillar of the town
Not but what hes been shaken a little toyear about this bad corn he has supplied in his contracts
Ive seen the sun rise over Durnover Moor these nineandsixty year and though Mr Henchard has never cussed me unfairly ever since Ive worked forn seeing I be but a little small man I must say that I have never before tasted such rough bread as has been made from Henchards wheat lately
Tis that growed out that ye could amost call it malt and theres a list at bottom o the loaf as thick as the sole of ones shoe
The band now struck up another melody and by the time it was ended the dinner was over and speeches began to be made
The evening being calm and the windows still open these orations could be distinctly heard
Henchards voice arose above the rest he was telling a story of his hay dealing experiences in which he had outwitted a sharper who had been bent upon outwitting him
Hahaha
responded his audience at the upshot of the story and hilarity was general till a new voice arose with This is all very well but how about the bad bread
It came from the lower end of the table where there sat a group of minor tradesmen who although part of the company appeared to be a little below the social level of the others and who seemed to nourish a certain independence of opinion and carry on discussions not quite in harmony with those at the head just as the west end of a church is sometimes persistently found to sing out of time and tune with the leading spirits in the chancel
This interruption about the bad bread afforded infinite satisfaction to the loungers outside several of whom were in the mood which finds its pleasure in others discomfiture and hence they echoed pretty freely Hey
How about the bad bread Mr
Mayor
Moreover feeling none of the restraints of those who shared the feast they could afford to add You rather ought to tell the story o that sir
The interruption was sufficient to compel the Mayor to notice it
Well I admit that the wheat turned out badly he said
But I was taken in in buying it as much as the bakers who bought it o me
And the poor folk who had to eat it whether or no said the inharmonious man outside the window
Henchards face darkened
There was temper under the thin bland surfacethe temper which artificially intensified had banished a wife nearly a score of years before
You must make allowances for the accidents of a large business he said
You must bear in mind that the weather just at the harvest of that corn was worse than we have known it for years
However I have mended my arrangements on account ot
Since I have found my business too large to be well looked after by myself alone I have advertised for a thorough good man as manager of the corn department
When Ive got him you will find these mistakes will no longer occurmatters will be better looked into
But what are you going to do to repay us for the past
inquired the man who had before spoken and who seemed to be a baker or miller
Will you replace the grown flour weve still got by sound grain
Henchards face had become still more stern at these interruptions and he drank from his tumbler of water as if to calm himself or gain time
Instead of vouchsafing a direct reply he stiffly observed If anybody will tell me how to turn grown wheat into wholesome wheat Ill take it back with pleasure
But it cant be done
Henchard was not to be drawn again
Having said this he sat down
6
Now the group outside the window had within the last few minutes been reinforced by new arrivals some of them respectable shopkeepers and their assistants who had come out for a whiff of air after putting up the shutters for the night some of them of a lower class
Distinct from either there appeared a strangera young man of remarkably pleasant aspectwho carried in his hand a carpetbag of the smart floral pattern prevalent in such articles at that time
He was ruddy and of a fair countenance brighteyed and slight in build
He might possibly have passed by without stopping at all or at most for half a minute to glance in at the scene had not his advent coincided with the discussion on corn and bread in which event this history had never been enacted
But the subject seemed to arrest him and he whispered some inquiries of the other bystanders and remained listening
When he heard Henchards closing words It cant be done he smiled impulsively drew out his pocketbook and wrote down a few words by the aid of the light in the window
He tore out the leaf folded and directed it and seemed about to throw it in through the open sash upon the diningtable but on second thoughts edged himself through the loiterers till he reached the door of the hotel where one of the waiters who had been serving inside was now idly leaning against the doorpost
Give this to the Mayor at once he said handing in his hasty note
ElizabethJane had seen his movements and heard the words which attracted her both by their subject and by their accenta strange one for those parts
It was quaint and northerly
The waiter took the note while the young stranger continued And can ye tell me of a respectable hotel thats a little more moderate than this
The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street
They say the Three Mariners just below here is a very good place he languidly answered but I have never stayed there myself
The Scotchman as he seemed to be thanked him and strolled on in the direction of the Three Mariners aforesaid apparently more concerned about the question of an inn than about the fate of his note now that the momentary impulse of writing it was over
While he was disappearing slowly down the street the waiter left the door and ElizabethJane saw with some interest the note brought into the diningroom and handed to the Mayor
Henchard looked at it carelessly unfolded it with one hand and glanced it through
Thereupon it was curious to note an unexpected effect
The nettled clouded aspect which had held possession of his face since the subject of his corn dealings had been broached changed itself into one of arrested attention
He read the note slowly and fell into thought not moody but fitfully intense as that of a man who has been captured by an idea
By this time toasts and speeches had given place to songs the wheat subject being quite forgotten
Men were putting their heads together in twos and threes telling good stories with pantomimic laughter which reached convulsive grimace
Some were beginning to look as if they did not know how they had come there what they had come for or how they were going to get home again and provisionally sat on with a dazed smile
Squarebuilt men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks men with a dignified presence lost it in a curious obliquity of figure in which their features grew disarranged and onesided whilst the heads of a few who had dined with extreme thoroughness were somehow sinking into their shoulders the corners of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the subsidence
Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes he remained stately and vertical silently thinking
The clock struck nine
ElizabethJane turned to her companion
The evening is drawing on mother she said
What do you propose to do
She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become
We must get a place to lie down in she murmured
I have seenMr Henchard and thats all I wanted to do
Thats enough for tonight at any rate ElizabethJane replied soothingly
We can think tomorrow what is best to do about him
The question now isis it nothow shall we find a lodging
As her mother did not reply ElizabethJanes mind reverted to the words of the waiter that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges
A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another
Lets go where the young man has gone to she said
He is respectable
What do you say
Her mother assented and down the street they went
In the meantime the Mayors thoughtfulness engendered by the note as stated continued to hold him in abstraction till whispering to his neighbour to take his place he found opportunity to leave the chair
This was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth
Outside the door of the assemblyroom he saw the waiter and beckoning to him asked who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter of an hour before
A young man sira sort of traveller
He was a Scotchman seemingly
Did he say how he had got it
He wrote it himself sir as he stood outside the window
Ohwrote it himselfIs the young man in the hotel
No sir
He went to the Three Mariners I believe
The mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands under his coat tails as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere than that of the room he had quitted
But there could be no doubt that he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea whatever that might be
At length he went back to the door of the diningroom paused and found that the songs toasts and conversation were proceeding quite satisfactorily without his presence
The Corporation private residents and major and minor tradesmen had in fact gone in for comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite forgotten not only the Mayor but all those vast political religious and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain in the daytime and which separated them like iron grills
Seeing this the Mayor took his hat and when the waiter had helped him on with a thin holland overcoat went out and stood under the portico
Very few persons were now in the street and his eyes by a sort of attraction turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further down
It was the house to which the writer of the note had gonethe Three Marinerswhose two prominent Elizabethan gables bowwindow and passagelight could be seen from where he stood
Having kept his eyes on it for a while he strolled in that direction
This ancient house of accommodation for man and beast now unfortunately pulled down was built of mellow sandstone with mullioned windows of the same material markedly out of perpendicular from the settlement of foundations
The bay window projecting into the street whose interior was so popular among the frequenters of the inn was closed with shutters in each of which appeared a heartshaped aperture somewhat more attenuated in the right and left ventricles than is seen in Nature
Inside these illuminated holes at a distance of about three inches were ranged at this hour as every passer knew the ruddy polls of Billy Wills the glazier Smart the shoemaker Buzzford the general dealer and others of a secondary set of worthies of a grade somewhat below that of the diners at the Kings Arms each with his yard of clay
A fourcentred Tudor arch was over the entrance and over the arch the signboard now visible in the rays of an opposite lamp
Hereon the Mariners who had been represented by the artist as persons of two dimensions only in other words flat as a shadowwere standing in a row in paralyzed attitudes
Being on the sunny side of the street the three comrades had suffered largely from warping splitting fading and shrinkage so that they were but a halfinvisible film upon the reality of the grain and knots and nails which composed the signboard
As a matter of fact this state of things was not so much owing to Stannidge the landlords neglect as from the lack of a painter in Casterbridge who would undertake to reproduce the features of men so traditional
A long narrow dimlylit passage gave access to the inn within which passage the horses going to their stalls at the back and the coming and departing human guests rubbed shoulders indiscriminately the latter running no slight risk of having their toes trodden upon by the animals
The good stabling and the good ale of the Mariners though somewhat difficult to reach on account of there being but this narrow way to both were nevertheless perseveringly sought out by the sagacious old heads who knew what was what in Casterbridge
Henchard stood without the inn for a few instants then lowering the dignity of his presence as much as possible by buttoning the brown holland coat over his shirtfront and in other ways toning himself down to his ordinary everyday appearance he entered the inn door
7
ElizabethJane and her mother had arrived some twenty minutes earlier
Outside the house they had stood and considered whether even this homely place though recommended as moderate might not be too serious in its prices for their light pockets
Finally however they had found courage to enter and duly met Stannidge the landlord a silent man who drew and carried frothing measures to this room and to that shoulder to shoulder with his waiting maidsa stately slowness however entering into his ministrations by contrast with theirs as became one whose service was somewhat optional
It would have been altogether optional but for the orders of the landlady a person who sat in the bar corporeally motionless but with a flitting eye and quick ear with which she observed and heard through the open door and hatchway the pressing needs of customers whom her husband overlooked though close at hand
Elizabeth and her mother were passively accepted as sojourners and shown to a small bedroom under one of the gables where they sat down
The principle of the inn seemed to be to compensate for the antique awkwardness crookedness and obscurity of the passages floors and windows by quantities of clean linen spread about everywhere and this had a dazzling effect upon the travellers
Tis too good for uswe cant meet it
said the elder woman looking round the apartment with misgiving as soon as they were left alone
I fear it is too said Elizabeth
But we must be respectable
We must pay our way even before we must be respectable replied her mother
Mr Henchard is too high for us to make ourselves known to him I much fear so weve only our own pockets to depend on
I know what Ill do said ElizabethJane after an interval of waiting during which their needs seemed quite forgotten under the press of business below
And leaving the room she descended the stairs and penetrated to the bar
If there was one good thing more than another which characterized this singlehearted girl it was a willingness to sacrifice her personal comfort and dignity to the common weal
As you seem busy here tonight and mothers not well off might I take out part of our accommodation by helping
she asked of the landlady
The latter who remained as fixed in the armchair as if she had been melted into it when in a liquid state and could not now be unstuck looked the girl up and down inquiringly with her hands on the chairarms
Such arrangements as the one Elizabeth proposed were not uncommon in country villages but though Casterbridge was oldfashioned the custom was wellnigh obsolete here
The mistress of the house however was an easy woman to strangers and she made no objection
Thereupon Elizabeth being instructed by nods and motions from the taciturn landlord as to where she could find the different things trotted up and down stairs with materials for her own and her parents meal
While she was doing this the wood partition in the centre of the house thrilled to its centre with the tugging of a bell pull upstairs
A bell below tinkled a note that was feebler in sound than the twanging of wires and cranks that had produced it
Tis the Scotch gentleman said the landlady omnisciently and turning her eyes to Elizabeth Now then can you go and see if his supper is on the tray
If it is you can take it up to him
The front room over this
ElizabethJane though hungry willingly postponed serving herself awhile and applied to the cook in the kitchen whence she brought forth the tray of supper viands and proceeded with it upstairs to the apartment indicated
The accommodation of the Three Mariners was far from spacious despite the fair area of ground it covered
The room demanded by intrusive beams and rafters partitions passages staircases disused ovens settles and four posters left comparatively small quarters for human beings
Moreover this being at a time before homebrewing was abandoned by the smaller victuallers and a house in which the twelvebushel strength was still religiously adhered to by the landlord in his ale the quality of the liquor was the chief attraction of the premises so that everything had to make way for utensils and operations in connection therewith
Thus Elizabeth found that the Scotchman was located in a room quite close to the small one that had been allotted to herself and her mother
When she entered nobody was present but the young man himselfthe same whom she had seen lingering without the windows of the Kings Arms Hotel
He was now idly reading a copy of the local paper and was hardly conscious of her entry so that she looked at him quite coolly and saw how his forehead shone where the light caught it and how nicely his hair was cut and the sort of velvetpile or down that was on the skin at the back of his neck and how his cheek was so truly curved as to be part of a globe and how clearly drawn were the lids and lashes which hid his bent eyes
She set down the tray spread his supper and went away without a word
On her arrival below the landlady who was as kind as she was fat and lazy saw that ElizabethJane was rather tired though in her earnestness to be useful she was waiving her own needs altogether
Mrs Stannidge thereupon said with a considerate peremptoriness that she and her mother had better take their own suppers if they meant to have any
Elizabeth fetched their simple provisions as she had fetched the Scotchmans and went up to the little chamber where she had left her mother noiselessly pushing open the door with the edge of the tray
To her surprise her mother instead of being reclined on the bed where she had left her was in an erect position with lips parted
At Elizabeths entry she lifted her finger
The meaning of this was soon apparent
The room allotted to the two women had at one time served as a dressingroom to the Scotchmans chamber as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between themnow screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper
But as is frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the Three Mariners every word spoken in either of these rooms was distinctly audible in the other
Such sounds came through now
Thus silently conjured Elizabeth deposited the tray and her mother whispered as she drew near Tis he
Who
said the girl
The Mayor
The tremors in Susan Henchards tone might have led any person but one so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was to surmise some closer connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of accounting for them
Two men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber the young Scotchman and Henchard who having entered the inn while ElizabethJane was in the kitchen waiting for the supper had been deferentially conducted upstairs by host Stannidge himself
The girl noiselessly laid out their little meal and beckoned to her mother to join her which Mrs Henchard mechanically did her attention being fixed on the conversation through the door
I merely strolled in on my way home to ask you a question about something that has excited my curiosity said the Mayor with careless geniality
But I see you have not finished supper
Ay but I will be done in a little
Ye neednt go sir
Take a seat
Ive almost done and it makes no difference at all
Henchard seemed to take the seat offered and in a moment he resumed Well first I should ask did you write this
A rustling of paper followed
Yes I did said the Scotchman
Then said Henchard I am under the impression that we have met by accident while waiting for the morning to keep an appointment with each other
My name is Henchard hant you replied to an advertisement for a cornfactors manager that I put into the paperhant you come here to see me about it
No said the Scotchman with some surprise
Surely you are the man went on Henchard insistingly who arranged to come and see me
Joshua Joshua JippJopp what was his name
Youre wrong
said the young man
My name is Donald Farfrae
It is true I am in the corren tradebut I have replied to no advertisement and arranged to see no one
I am on my way to Bristolfrom there to the other side of the warrld to try my fortune in the great wheatgrowing districts of the West
I have some inventions useful to the trade and there is no scope for developing them heere
To Americawell well said Henchard in a tone of disappointment so strong as to make itself felt like a damp atmosphere
And yet I could have sworn you were the man
The Scotchman murmured another negative and there was a silence till Henchard resumed Then I am truly and sincerely obliged to you for the few words you wrote on that paper
It was nothing sir
Well it has a great importance for me just now
This row about my grown wheat which I declare to Heaven I didnt know to be bad till the people came complaining has put me to my wits end
Ive some hundreds of quarters of it on hand and if your renovating process will make it wholesome why you can see what a quag twould get me out of
I saw in a moment there might be truth in it
But I should like to have it proved and of course you dont care to tell the steps of the process sufficiently for me to do that without my paying ye well fort first
The young man reflected a moment or two
I dont know that I have any objection he said
Im going to another country and curing bad corn is not the line Ill take up there
Yes Ill tell ye the whole of ityoull make more out of it heere than I will in a foreign country
Just look heere a minute sir
I can show ye by a sample in my carpetbag
The click of a lock followed and there was a sifting and rustling then a discussion about so many ounces to the bushel and drying and refrigerating and so on
These few grains will be sufficient to show ye with came in the young fellows voice and after a pause during which some operation seemed to be intently watched by them both he exclaimed There now do you taste that
Its completequite restored orwellnearly
Quite enough restored to make good seconds out of it said the Scotchman
To fetch it back entirely is impossible Nature wont stand so much as that but heere you go a great way towards it
Well sir thats the process I dont value it for it can be but of little use in countries where the weather is more settled than in ours and Ill be only too glad if its of service to you
But hearken to me pleaded Henchard
My business you know is in corn and in hay but I was brought up as a hay trusser simply and hay is what I understand best though I now do more in corn than in the other
If youll accept the place you shall manage the corn branch entirely and receive a commission in addition to salary
Youre liberalvery liberal but no noI cannet
the young man still replied with some distress in his accents
So be it
said Henchard conclusively
Nowto change the subjectone good turn deserves another dont stay to finish that miserable supper
Come to my house I can find something better for ee than cold ham and ale
Donald Farfrae was gratefulsaid he feared he must decline that he wished to leave early next day
Very well said Henchard quickly please yourself
But I tell you young man if this holds good for the bulk as it has done for the sample you have saved my credit stranger though you be
What shall I pay you for this knowledge
Nothing at all nothing at all
It may not prove necessary to ye to use it often and I dont value it at all
I thought I might just as well let ye know as you were in a difficulty and they were harrd upon ye
Henchard paused
I shant soon forget this he said
And from a strangerI couldnt believe you were not the man I had engaged
Says I to myself He knows who I am and recommends himself by this stroke
And yet it turns out after all that you are not the man who answered my advertisement but a stranger
Ay ay thats so said the young man
Henchard again suspended his words and then his voice came thoughtfully Your forehead Farfrae is something like my poor brothersnow dead and gone and the nose too isnt unlike his
You must be whatfive foot nine I reckon
I am six foot one and a half out of my shoes
But what of that
In my business tis true that strength and bustle build up a firm
But judgment and knowledge are what keep it established
Unluckily I am bad at science Farfrae bad at figuresa rule o thumb sort of man
You are just the reverseI can see that
I have been looking for such as you these two year and yet you are not for me
Well before I go let me ask this Though you are not the young man I thought you were whats the difference
Cant ye stay just the same
Have you really made up your mind about this American notion
I wont mince matters
I feel you would be invaluable to methat neednt be saidand if you will bide and be my manager I will make it worth your while
My plans are fixed said the young man in negative tones
I have formed a scheme and so we need na say any more about it
But will you not drink with me sir
I find this Casterbridge ale warreming to the stomach
No no I fain would but I cant said Henchard gravely the scraping of his chair informing the listeners that he was rising to leave
When I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strongfar too strongand was well nigh ruined by it
I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day
It made such an impression on me that I swore there and then that Id drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day
I have kept my oath and though Farfrae I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarterbarrel to the pitching I think o my oath and touch no strong drink at all
Ill no press ye sirIll no press ye
I respect your vow
Well I shall get a manager somewhere no doubt said Henchard with strong feeling in his tones
But it will be long before I see one that would suit me so well
The young man appeared much moved by Henchards warm convictions of his value
He was silent till they reached the door
I wish I could staysincerely I would like to he replied
But noit cannet be
it cannet
I want to see the warrld
8
Thus they parted and ElizabethJane and her mother remained each in her thoughts over their meal the mothers face being strangely bright since Henchards avowal of shame for a past action
The quivering of the partition to its core presented denoted that Donald Farfrae had again rung his bell no doubt to have his supper removed for humming a tune and walking up and down he seemed to be attracted by the lively bursts of conversation and melody from the general company below
He sauntered out upon the landing and descended the staircase
When ElizabethJane had carried down his supper tray and also that used by her mother and herself she found the bustle of serving to be at its height below as it always was at this hour
The young woman shrank from having anything to do with the groundfloor serving and crept silently about observing the sceneso new to her fresh from the seclusion of a seaside cottage
In the general sittingroom which was large she remarked the two or three dozen strongbacked chairs that stood round against the wall each fitted with its genial occupant the sanded floor the black settle which projecting endwise from the wall within the door permitted Elizabeth to be a spectator of all that went on without herself being particularly seen
The young Scotchman had just joined the guests
These in addition to the respectable mastertradesmen occupying the seats of privileges in the bowwindow and its neighbourhood included an inferior set at the unlighted end whose seats were mere benches against the wall and who drank from cups instead of from glasses
Among the latter she noticed some of those personages who had stood outside the windows of the Kings Arms
Behind their backs was a small window with a wheel ventilator in one of the panes which would suddenly start off spinning with a jingling sound as suddenly stop and as suddenly start again
While thus furtively making her survey the opening words of a song greeted her ears from the front of the settle in a melody and accent of peculiar charm
There had been some singing before she came down and now the Scotchman had made himself so soon at home that at the request of some of the mastertradesmen he too was favouring the room with a ditty
ElizabethJane was fond of music she could not help pausing to listen and the longer she listened the more she was enraptured
She had never heard any singing like this and it was evident that the majority of the audience had not heard such frequently for they were attentive to a much greater degree than usual
They neither whispered nor drank nor dipped their pipestems in their ale to moisten them nor pushed the mug to their neighbours
The singer himself grew emotional till she could imagine a tear in his eye as the words went on Its hame and its hame hame fain would I be O hame hame hame to my ain countree
Theres an eye that ever weeps and a fair face will be fain As I pass through Annan Water with my bonnie bands again When the flower is in the bud and the leaf upon the tree The lark shall sing me hame to my ain countree
There was a burst of applause and a deep silence which was even more eloquent than the applause
It was of such a kind that the snapping of a pipestem too long for him by old Solomon Longways who was one of those gathered at the shady end of the room seemed a harsh and irreverent act
Then the ventilator in the windowpane spasmodically started off for a new spin and the pathos of Donalds song was temporarily effaced
Twas not amissnot at all amiss
muttered Christopher Coney who was also present
And removing his pipe a fingers breadth from his lips he said aloud Draw on with the next verse young gentleman please
Yes
Lets have it again stranger said the glazier a stout bucketheaded man with a white apron rolled up round his waist
Folks dont lift up their hearts like that in this part of the world
And turning aside he said in undertones Who is the young manScotch dye say
Yes straight from the mountains of Scotland I believe replied Coney
Young Farfrae repeated the last verse
It was plain that nothing so pathetic had been heard at the Three Mariners for a considerable time
The difference of accent the excitability of the singer the intense local feeling and the seriousness with which he worked himself up to a climax surprised this set of worthies who were only too prone to shut up their emotions with caustic words
Danged if our country down here is worth singing about like that
continued the glazier as the Scotchman again melodized with a dying fall My ain countree
When you take away from among us the fools and the rogues and the lammigers and the wanton hussies and the slatterns and such like theres cust few left to ornament a song with in Casterbridge or the country round
True said Buzzford the dealer looking at the grain of the table
Casterbridge is a old hoary place o wickedness by all account
Tis recorded in history that we rebelled against the King one or two hundred years ago in the time of the Romans and that lots of us was hanged on Gallows Hill and quartered and our different jints sent about the country like butchers meat and for my part I can well believe it
What did ye come away from yer own country for young maister if ye be so wownded about it
inquired Christopher Coney from the background with the tone of a man who preferred the original subject
Faith it wasnt worth your while on our account for as Maister Billy Wills says we be bruckle folk herethe best o us hardly honest sometimes what with hard winters and so many mouths to fill and Godamighty sending his little taties so terrible small to fill em with
We dont think about flowers and fair faces not weexcept in the shape o cauliflowers and pigs chaps
But no
said Donald Farfrae gazing round into their faces with earnest concern the best of ye hardly honest not that surely
None of ye has been stealing what didnt belong to him
Lord
no no
said Solomon Longways smiling grimly
Thats only his random way o speaking
A was always such a man of underthoughts
And reprovingly towards Christopher Dont ye be so overfamiliar with a gentleman that ye know nothing ofand thats travelled amost from the North Pole
Christopher Coney was silenced and as he could get no public sympathy he mumbled his feelings to himself Be dazed if I loved my country half as well as the young feller do Id live by claning my neighbours pigsties afore Id go away
For my part Ive no more love for my country than I have for Botany Bay
Come said Longways let the young man draw onward with his ballet or we shall be here all night
Thats all of it said the singer apologetically
Soul of my body then well have another
said the general dealer
Can you turn a strain to the ladies sir
inquired a fat woman with a figured purple apron the waiststring of which was overhung so far by her sides as to be invisible
Let him breathelet him breathe Mother Cuxsom
He haint got his second wind yet said the master glazier
Oh yes but I have
exclaimed the young man and he at once rendered O Nannie with faultless modulations and another or two of the like sentiment winding up at their earnest request with Auld Lang Syne
By this time he had completely taken possession of the hearts of the Three Mariners inmates including even old Coney
Notwithstanding an occasional odd gravity which awoke their sense of the ludicrous for the moment they began to view him through a golden haze which the tone of his mind seemed to raise around him
Casterbridge had sentimentCasterbridge had romance but this strangers sentiment was of differing quality
Or rather perhaps the difference was mainly superficial he was to them like the poet of a new school who takes his contemporaries by storm who is not really new but is the first to articulate what all his listeners have felt though but dumbly till then
The silent landlord came and leant over the settle while the young man sang and even Mrs Stannidge managed to unstick herself from the framework of her chair in the bar and get as far as the doorpost which movement she accomplished by rolling herself round as a cask is trundled on the chine by a drayman without losing much of its perpendicular
And are you going to bide in Casterbridge sir
she asked
Ahno
said the Scotchman with melancholy fatality in his voice Im only passing thirrough
I am on my way to Bristol and on frae there to foreign parts
We be truly sorry to hear it said Solomon Longways
We can ill afford to lose tuneful wyndpipes like yours when they fall among us
And verily to mak acquaintance with a man acome from so far from the land o perpetual snow as we may say where wolves and wild boars and other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds hereaboutwhy tis a thing we cant do every day and theres good sound information for bideathomes like we when such a man opens his mouth
Nay but ye mistake my country said the young man looking round upon them with tragic fixity till his eye lighted up and his cheek kindled with a sudden enthusiasm to right their errors
There are not perpetual snow and wolves at all in itexcept snow in winter andwella little in summer just sometimes and a gaberlunzie or two stalking about here and there if ye may call them dangerous
Eh but you should take a summer jarreny to Edinboro and Arthurs Seat and all round there and then go on to the lochs and all the Highland sceneryin May and Juneand you would never say tis the land of wolves and perpetual snow
Of course notit stands to reason said Buzzford
Tis barren ignorance that leads to such words
Hes a simple homespun man that never was fit for good companythink nothing of him sir
And do ye carry your flock bed and your quilt and your crock and your bit of chiney
or do ye go in bare bones as I may say
inquired Christopher Coney
Ive sent on my luggagethough it isnt much for the voyage is long
Donalds eyes dropped into a remote gaze as he added But I said to myself Never a one of the prizes of life will I come by unless I undertake it
and I decided to go
A general sense of regret in which ElizabethJane shared not least made itself apparent in the company
As she looked at Farfrae from the back of the settle she decided that his statements showed him to be no less thoughtful than his fascinating melodies revealed him to be cordial and impassioned
She admired the serious light in which he looked at serious things
He had seen no jest in ambiguities and roguery as the Casterbridge tosspots had done and rightly notthere was none
She disliked those wretched humours of Christopher Coney and his tribe and he did not appreciate them
He seemed to feel exactly as she felt about life and its surroundingsthat they were a tragical rather than a comical thing that though one could be gay on occasion moments of gaiety were interludes and no part of the actual drama
It was extraordinary how similar their views were
Though it was still early the young Scotchman expressed his wish to retire whereupon the landlady whispered to Elizabeth to run upstairs and turn down his bed
She took a candlestick and proceeded on her mission which was the act of a few moments only
When candle in hand she reached the top of the stairs on her way down again Mr Farfrae was at the foot coming up
She could not very well retreat they met and passed in the turn of the staircase
She must have appeared interesting in some waynot withstanding her plain dressor rather possibly in consequence of it for she was a girl characterized by earnestness and soberness of mien with which simple drapery accorded well
Her face flushed too at the slight awkwardness of the meeting and she passed him with her eyes bent on the candleflame that she carried just below her nose
Thus it happened that when confronting her he smiled and then with the manner of a temporarily lighthearted man who has started himself on a flight of song whose momentum he cannot readily check he softly tuned an old ditty that she seemed to suggest As I came in by my bower door As day was waxin wearie Oh wha came tripping down the stair But bonnie Peg my dearie
ElizabethJane rather disconcerted hastened on and the Scotchmans voice died away humming more of the same within the closed door of his room
Here the scene and sentiment ended for the present
When soon after the girl rejoined her mother the latter was still in thoughton quite another matter than a young mans song
Weve made a mistake she whispered that the Scotchman might not overhear
On no account ought ye to have helped serve here tonight
Not because of ourselves but for the sake of him
If he should befriend us and take us up and then find out what you did when staying here twould grieve and wound his natural pride as Mayor of the town
Elizabeth who would perhaps have been more alarmed at this than her mother had she known the real relationship was not much disturbed about it as things stood
Her he was another man than her poor mothers
For myself she said I didnt at all mind waiting a little upon him
Hes so respectable and educatedfar above the rest of em in the inn
They thought him very simple not to know their grim broad way of talking about themselves here
But of course he didnt knowhe was too refined in his mind to know such things
Thus she earnestly pleaded
Meanwhile the he of her mother was not so far away as even they thought
After leaving the Three Mariners he had sauntered up and down the empty High Street passing and repassing the inn in his promenade
When the Scotchman sang his voice had reached Henchards ears through the heart shaped holes in the windowshutters and had led him to pause outside them a long while
To be sure to be sure how that fellow does draw me
he had said to himself
I suppose tis because Im so lonely
Id have given him a third share in the business to have stayed
9
When ElizabethJane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if she had been in the remotest hamlet
Casterbridge was the complement of the rural life around not its urban opposite
Bees and butterflies in the cornfields at the top of the town who desired to get to the meads at the bottom took no circuitous course but flew straight down High Street without any apparent consciousness that they were traversing strange latitudes
And in autumn airy spheres of thistledown floated into the same street lodged upon the shop fronts blew into drains and innumerable tawny and yellow leaves skimmed along the pavement and stole through peoples doorways into their passages with a hesitating scratch on the floor like the skirts of timid visitors
Hearing voices one of which was close at hand she withdrew her head and glanced from behind the windowcurtains
Mr Henchardnow habited no longer as a great personage but as a thriving man of businesswas pausing on his way up the middle of the street and the Scotchman was looking from the window adjoining her own
Henchard it appeared had gone a little way past the inn before he had noticed his acquaintance of the previous evening
He came back a few steps Donald Farfrae opening the window further
And you are off soon I suppose
said Henchard upwards
Yesalmost this moment sir said the other
Maybe Ill walk on till the coach makes up on me
Which way
The way ye are going
Then shall we walk together to the top o town
If yell wait a minute said the Scotchman
In a few minutes the latter emerged bag in hand
Henchard looked at the bag as at an enemy
It showed there was no mistake about the young mans departure
Ah my lad he said you should have been a wise man and have stayed with me
Yes yesit might have been wiser said Donald looking microscopically at the houses that were furthest off
It is only telling ye the truth when I say my plans are vague
They had by this time passed on from the precincts of the inn and ElizabethJane heard no more
She saw that they continued in conversation Henchard turning to the other occasionally and emphasizing some remark with a gesture
Thus they passed the Kings Arms Hotel the Market House St Peters churchyard wall ascending to the upper end of the long street till they were small as two grains of corn when they bent suddenly to the right into the Bristol Road and were out of view
He was a good manand hes gone she said to herself
I was nothing to him and there was no reason why he should have wished me goodbye
The simple thought with its latent sense of slight had moulded itself out of the following little fact when the Scotchman came out at the door he had by accident glanced up at her and then he had looked away again without nodding or smiling or saying a word
You are still thinking mother she said when she turned inwards
Yes I am thinking of Mr Henchards sudden liking for that young man
He was always so
Now surely if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all may he not take as warmly to his own kin
While they debated this question a procession of five large waggons went past laden with hay up to the bedroom windows
They came in from the country and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great part of the night
To the shaft of each hung a little board on which was painted in white letters Henchard cornfactor and haymerchant
The spectacle renewed his wifes conviction that for her daughters sake she should strain a point to rejoin him
The discussion was continued during breakfast and the end of it was that Mrs Henchard decided for good or for ill to send ElizabethJane with a message to Henchard to the effect that his relative Susan a sailors widow was in the town leaving it to him to say whether or not he would recognize her
What had brought her to this determination were chiefly two things
He had been described as a lonely widower and he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life
There was promise in both
If he says no she enjoined as ElizabethJane stood bonnet on ready to depart if he thinks it does not become the good position he has reached to in the town to ownto let us call on him ashis distant kinfolk say Then sir we would rather not intrude we will leave Casterbridge as quietly as we have come and go back to our own country
I almost feel that I would rather he did say so as I have not seen him for so many years and we are so little allied to him
And if he say yes
inquired the more sanguine one
In that case answered Mrs Henchard cautiously ask him to write me a note saying when and how he will see usor ME
ElizabethJane went a few steps towards the landing
And tell him continued her mother that I fully know I have no claim upon himthat I am glad to find he is thriving that I hope his life may be long and happythere go
Thus with a halfhearted willingness a smothered reluctance did the poor forgiving woman start her unconscious daughter on this errand
It was about ten oclock and marketday when Elizabeth paced up the High Street in no great hurry for to herself her position was only that of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one
The front doors of the private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid burgesses
Hence through the long straight entrance passages thus unclosed could be seen as through tunnels the mossy gardens at the back glowing with nasturtiums fuchsias scarlet geraniums bloody warriors snapdragons and dahlias this floral blaze being backed by crusted grey stonework remaining from a yet remoter Casterbridge than the venerable one visible in the street
The oldfashioned fronts of these houses which had older than oldfashioned backs rose sheer from the pavement into which the bow windows protruded like bastions necessitating a pleasing chassezdechassez movement to the timepressed pedestrian at every few yards
He was bound also to evolve other Terpsichorean figures in respect of doorsteps scrapers cellarhatches church buttresses and the overhanging angles of walls which originally unobtrusive had become bowlegged and knockkneed
In addition to these fixed obstacles which spoke so cheerfully of individual unrestraint as to boundaries movables occupied the path and roadway to a perplexing extent
First the vans of the carriers in and out of Casterbridge who hailed from Mellstock Weatherbury The Hintocks ShertonAbbas Kingsbere Overcombe and many other towns and villages round
Their owners were numerous enough to be regarded as a tribe and had almost distinctiveness enough to be regarded as a race
Their vans had just arrived and were drawn up on each side of the street in close file so as to form at places a wall between the pavement and the roadway
Moreover every shop pitched out half its contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb extending the display each week a little further and further into the roadway despite the expostulations of the two feeble old constables until there remained but a tortuous defile for carriages down the centre of the street which afforded fine opportunities for skill with the reins
Over the pavement on the sunny side of the way hung shopblinds so constructed as to give the passengers hat a smart buffet off his head as from the unseen hands of Cranstouns Goblin Page celebrated in romantic lore
Horses for sale were tied in rows their forelegs on the pavement their hind legs in the street in which position they occasionally nipped little boys by the shoulder who were passing to school
And any inviting recess in front of a house that had been modestly kept back from the general line was utilized by pigdealers as a pen for their stock
The yeomen farmers dairymen and townsfolk who came to transact business in these ancient streets spoke in other ways than by articulation
Not to hear the words of your interlocutor in metropolitan centres is to know nothing of his meaning
Here the face the arms the hat the stick the body throughout spoke equally with the tongue
To express satisfaction the Casterbridge marketman added to his utterance a broadening of the cheeks a crevicing of the eyes a throwing back of the shoulders which was intelligible from the other end of the street
If he wondered though all Henchards carts and waggons were rattling past him you knew it from perceiving the inside of his crimson mouth and a targetlike circling of his eyes
Deliberation caused sundry attacks on the moss of adjoining walls with the end of his stick a change of his hat from the horizontal to the less so a sense of tediousness announced itself in a lowering of the person by spreading the knees to a lozengeshaped aperture and contorting the arms
Chicanery subterfuge had hardly a place in the streets of this honest borough to all appearance and it was said that the lawyers in the Court House hard by occasionally threw in strong arguments for the other side out of pure generosity though apparently by mischance when advancing their own
Thus Casterbridge was in most respects but the pole focus or nerveknot of the surrounding country life differing from the many manufacturing towns which are as foreign bodies set down like boulders on a plain in a green world with which they have nothing in common
Casterbridge lived by agriculture at one remove further from the fountainhead than the adjoining villagesno more
The townsfolk understood every fluctuation in the rustics condition for it affected their receipts as much as the labourers they entered into the troubles and joys which moved the aristocratic families ten miles roundfor the same reason
And even at the dinnerparties of the professional families the subjects of discussion were corn cattledisease sowing and reaping fencing and planting while politics were viewed by them less from their own standpoint of burgesses with rights and privileges than from the standpoint of their country neighbours
All the venerable contrivances and confusions which delighted the eye by their quaintness and in a measure reasonableness in this rare old markettown were metropolitan novelties to the unpractised eyes of Elizabeth Jane fresh from netting fishseines in a seaside cottage
Very little inquiry was necessary to guide her footsteps
Henchards house was one of the best faced with dull red andgrey old brick
The front door was open and as in other houses she could see through the passage to the end of the gardennearly a quarter of a mile off
Mr Henchard was not in the house but in the storeyard
She was conducted into the mossy garden and through a door in the wall which was studded with rusty nails speaking of generations of fruittrees that had been trained there
The door opened upon the yard and here she was left to find him as she could
It was a place flanked by haybarns into which tons of fodder all in trusses were being packed from the waggons she had seen pass the inn that morning
On other sides of the yard were wooden granaries on stone staddles to which access was given by Flemish ladders and a storehouse several floors high
Wherever the doors of these places were open a closely packed throng of bursting wheatsacks could be seen standing inside with the air of awaiting a famine that would not come
She wandered about this place uncomfortably conscious of the impending interview till she was quite weary of searching she ventured to inquire of a boy in what quarter Mr Henchard could be found
He directed her to an office which she had not seen before and knocking at the door she was answered by a cry of Come in
Elizabeth turned the handle and there stood before her bending over some samplebags on a table not the corn merchant but the young Scotchman Mr Farfraein the act of pouring some grains of wheat from one hand to the other
His hat hung on a peg behind him and the roses of his carpetbag glowed from the corner of the room
Having toned her feelings and arranged words on her lips for Mr Henchard and for him alone she was for the moment confounded
Yes what it is
said the Scotchman like a man who permanently ruled there
She said she wanted to see Mr Henchard
Ah yes will you wait a minute
Hes engaged just now said the young man apparently not recognizing her as the girl at the inn
He handed her a chair bade her sit down and turned to his samplebags again
While ElizabethJane sits waiting in great amaze at the young mans presence we may briefly explain how he came there
When the two new acquaintances had passed out of sight that morning towards the Bath and Bristol road they went on silently except for a few commonplaces till they had gone down an avenue on the town walls called the Chalk Walk leading to an angle where the North and West escarpments met
From this high corner of the square earthworks a vast extent of country could be seen
A footpath ran steeply down the green slope conducting from the shady promenade on the walls to a road at the bottom of the scarp
It was by this path the Scotchman had to descend
Well heres success to ee said Henchard holding out his right hand and leaning with his left upon the wicket which protected the descent
In the act there was the inelegance of one whose feelings are nipped and wishes defeated
I shall often think of this time and of how you came at the very moment to throw a light upon my difficulty
Still holding the young mans hand he paused and then added deliberately Now I am not the man to let a cause be lost for want of a word
And before ye are gone for ever Ill speak
Once more will ye stay
There it is flat and plain
You can see that it isnt all selfishness that makes me press ee for my business is not quite so scientific as to require an intellect entirely out of the common
Others would do for the place without doubt
Some selfishness perhaps there is but there is more it isnt for me to repeat what
Come bide with meand name your own terms
Ill agree to em willingly and ithout a word of gainsaying for hang it Farfrae I like thee well
The young mans hand remained steady in Henchards for a moment or two
He looked over the fertile country that stretched beneath them then backward along the shaded walk reaching to the top of the town
His face flushed
I never expected thisI did not
he said
Its Providence
Should any one go against it
No Ill not go to America Ill stay and be your man
His hand which had lain lifeless in Henchards returned the latters grasp
Done said Henchard
Done said Donald Farfrae
The face of Mr Henchard beamed forth a satisfaction that was almost fierce in its strength
Now you are my friend
he exclaimed
Come back to my house lets clinch it at once by clear terms so as to be comfortable in our minds
Farfrae caught up his bag and retraced the NorthWest Avenue in Henchards company as he had come
Henchard was all confidence now
I am the most distant fellow in the world when I dont care for a man he said
But when a man takes my fancy he takes it strong
Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast
You couldnt have eaten much so early even if they had anything at that place to gie thee which they hadnt so come to my house and we will have a solid staunch tuckin and settle terms in blackandwhite if you like though my words my bond
I can always make a good meal in the morning
Ive got a splendid cold pigeonpie going just now
You can have some homebrewed if you want to you know
It is too airly in the morning for that said Farfrae with a smile
Well of course I didnt know
I dont drink it because of my oath but I am obliged to brew for my workpeople
Thus talking they returned and entered Henchards premises by the back way or traffic entrance
Here the matter was settled over the breakfast at which Henchard heaped the young Scotchmans plate to a prodigal fulness
He would not rest satisfied till Farfrae had written for his luggage from Bristol and dispatched the letter to the postoffice
When it was done this man of strong impulses declared that his new friend should take up his abode in his houseat least till some suitable lodgings could be found
He then took Farfrae round and showed him the place and the stores of grain and other stock and finally entered the offices where the younger of them has already been discovered by Elizabeth
10
While she still sat under the Scotchmans eyes a man came up to the door reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit Elizabeth
The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at Bethesda and entered in her stead
She could hear his words to Henchard Joshua Jopp sirby appointmentthe new manager
The new managerhes in his office said Henchard bluntly
In his office
said the man with a stultified air
I mentioned Thursday said Henchard and as you did not keep your appointment I have engaged another manager
At first I thought he must be you
Do you think I can wait when business is in question
You said Thursday or Saturday sir said the newcomer pulling out a letter
Well you are too late said the cornfactor
I can say no more
You as good as engaged me murmured the man
Subject to an interview said Henchard
I am sorry for youvery sorry indeed
But it cant be helped
There was no more to be said and the man came out encountering ElizabethJane in his passage
She could see that his mouth twitched with anger and that bitter disappointment was written in his face everywhere
ElizabethJane now entered and stood before the master of the premises
His dark pupilswhich always seemed to have a red spark of light in them though this could hardly be a physical factturned indifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her figure
Now then what is it my young woman
he said blandly
Can I speak to younot on business sir
said she
YesI suppose
He looked at her more thoughtfully
I am sent to tell you sir she innocently went on that a distant relative of yours by marriage Susan Newson a sailors widow is in the town and to ask whether you would wish to see her
The rich rougeetnoir of his countenance underwent a slight change
OhSusan isstill alive
he asked with difficulty
Yes sir
Are you her daughter
Yes sirher only daughter
Whatdo you call yourselfyour Christian name
ElizabethJane sir
Newson
ElizabethJane Newson
This at once suggested to Henchard that the transaction of his early married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history
It was more than he could have expected
His wife had behaved kindly to him in return for his unkindness and had never proclaimed her wrong to her child or to the world
I ama good deal interested in your news he said
And as this is not a matter of business but pleasure suppose we go indoors
It was with a gentle delicacy of manner surprising to Elizabeth that he showed her out of the office and through the outer room where Donald Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection of a beginner in charge
Henchard preceded her through the door in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers and onward into the house
The diningroom to which he introduced her still exhibited the remnants of the lavish breakfast laid for Farfrae
It was furnished to profusion with heavy mahogany furniture of the deepest redSpanish hues
Pembroke tables with leaves hanging so low that they wellnigh touched the floor stood against the walls on legs and feet shaped like those of an elephant and on one lay three huge folio volumesa Family Bible a Josephus and a Whole Duty of Man
In the chimney comer was a firegrate with a fluted semicircular back having urns and festoons cast in relief thereon and the chairs were of the kind which since that day has cast lustre upon the names of Chippendale and Sheraton though in point of fact their patterns may have been such as those illustrious carpenters never saw or heard of
Sit downElizabethJanesit down he said with a shake in his voice as he uttered her name and sitting down himself he allowed his hands to hang between his knees while he looked upon the carpet
Your mother then is quite well
She is rather worn out sir with travelling
A sailors widowwhen did he die
Father was lost last spring
Henchard winced at the word father thus applied
Do you and she come from abroadAmerica or Australia
he asked
No
We have been in England some years
I was twelve when we came here from Canada
Ah exactly
By such conversation he discovered the circumstances which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that he had long ago believed them to be in their graves
These things being clear he returned to the present
And where is your mother staying
At the Three Mariners
And you are her daughter ElizabethJane
repeated Henchard
He arose came close to her and glanced in her face
I think he said suddenly turning away with a wet eye you shall take a note from me to your mother
I should like to see herShe is not left very well off by her late husband
His eye fell on Elizabeths clothes which though a respectable suit of black and her very best were decidedly oldfashioned even to Casterbridge eyes
Not very well she said glad that he had divined this without her being obliged to express it
He sat down at the table and wrote a few lines next taking from his pocketbook a fivepound note which he put in the envelope with the letter adding to it as by an afterthought five shillings
Sealing the whole up carefully he directed it to Mrs Newson Three Mariners Inn and handed the packet to Elizabeth
Deliver it to her personally please said Henchard
Well I am glad to see you here ElizabethJanevery glad
We must have a long talk togetherbut not just now
He took her hand at parting and held it so warmly that she who had known so little friendship was much affected and tears rose to her aerialgrey eyes
The instant that she was gone Henchards state showed itself more distinctly having shut the door he sat in his diningroom stiffly erect gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history there
Begad
he suddenly exclaimed jumping up
I didnt think of that
Perhaps these are impostorsand Susan and the child dead after all
However a something in ElizabethJane soon assured him that as regarded her at least there could be little doubt
And a few hours would settle the question of her mothers identity for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening
It never rains but it pours
said Henchard
His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employers moods
In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn
Her mother instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance was much moved at sight of it
She did not read it at once asking Elizabeth to describe her reception and the very words Mr Henchard used
Elizabeths back was turned when her mother opened the letter
It ran thus Meet me at eight oclock this evening if you can at the Ring on the Budmouth road
The place is easy to find
I can say no more now
The news upsets me almost
The girl seems to be in ignorance
Keep her so till I have seen you
M H He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas
The amount was significant it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again
She waited restlessly for the close of the day telling ElizabethJane that she was invited to see Mr Henchard that she would go alone
But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not at his house nor did she hand the note to Elizabeth
11
The Ring at Casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest Roman Amphitheatres if not the very finest remaining in Britain
Casterbridge announced old Rome in every street alley and precinct
It looked Roman bespoke the art of Rome concealed dead men of Rome
It was impossible to dig more than a foot or two deep about the town fields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or other of the Empire who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of fifteen hundred years
He was mostly found lying on his side in an oval scoop in the chalk like a chicken in its shell his knees drawn up to his chest sometimes with the remains of his spear against his arm a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead an urn at his knees a jar at his throat a bottle at his mouth and mystified conjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of Casterbridge street boys and men who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle as they passed by
Imaginative inhabitants who would have felt an unpleasantness at the discovery of a comparatively modern skeleton in their gardens were quite unmoved by these hoary shapes
They had lived so long ago their time was so unlike the present their hopes and motives were so widely removed from ours that between them and the living there seemed to stretch a gulf too wide for even a spirit to pass
The Amphitheatre was a huge circular enclosure with a notch at opposite extremities of its diameter north and south
From its sloping internal form it might have been called the spittoon of the Jotuns
It was to Casterbridge what the ruined Coliseum is to modern Rome and was nearly of the same magnitude
The dusk of evening was the proper hour at which a true impression of this suggestive place could be received
Standing in the middle of the arena at that time there by degrees became apparent its real vastness which a cursory view from the summit at noonday was apt to obscure
Melancholy impressive lonely yet accessible from every part of the town the historic circle was the frequent spot for appointments of a furtive kind
Intrigues were arranged there tentative meetings were there experimented after divisions and feuds
But one kind of appointmentin itself the most common of anyseldom had place in the Amphitheatre that of happy lovers
Why seeing that it was preeminently an airy accessible and sequestered spot for interviews the cheerfullest form of those occurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin would be a curious inquiry
Perhaps it was because its associations had about them something sinister
Its history proved that
Apart from the sanguinary nature of the games originally played therein such incidents attached to its past as these that for scores of years the town gallows had stood at one corner that in 1705 a woman who had murdered her husband was halfstrangled and then burnt there in the presence of ten thousand spectators
Tradition reports that at a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her body to the terror of them all and that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that
In addition to these old tragedies pugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top of the enclosure which few townspeople in the daily round of their lives ever took the trouble to do
So that though close to the turnpikeroad crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at midday
Some boys had latterly tried to impart gaiety to the ruin by using the central arena as a cricketground
But the game usually languished for the aforesaid reasonthe dismal privacy which the earthen circle enforced shutting out every appreciative passers vision every commendatory remark from outsiderseverything except the sky and to play at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house
Possibly too the boys were timid for some old people said that at certain moments in the summer time in broad daylight persons sitting with a book or dozing in the arena had on lifting their eyes beheld the slopes lined with a gazing legion of Hadrians soldiery as if watching the gladiatorial combat and had heard the roar of their excited voices that the scene would remain but a moment like a lightning flash and then disappear
It was related that there still remained under the south entrance excavated cells for the reception of the wild animals and athletes who took part in the games
The arena was still smooth and circular as if used for its original purpose not so very long ago
The sloping pathways by which spectators had ascended to their seats were pathways yet
But the whole was grown over with grass which now at the end of summer was bearded with withered bents that formed waves under the brush of the wind returning to the attentive ear aeolian modulations and detaining for moments the flying globes of thistledown
Henchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation which he could think of for meeting his long lost wife and at the same time as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall
As Mayor of the town with a reputation to keep up he could not invite her to come to his house till some definite course had been decided on
Just before eight he approached the deserted earthwork and entered by the south path which descended over the debris of the former dens
In a few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great north gap or public gateway
They met in the middle of the arena
Neither spoke just at firstthere was no necessity for speechand the poor woman leant against Henchard who supported her in his arms
I dont drink he said in a low halting apologetic voice
You hear SusanI dont drink nowI havent since that night
Those were his first words
He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood
After a minute or two he again began If I had known you were living Susan
But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone
I took every possible step to find youtravelledadvertised
My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man and had been drowned on your voyage
Why did you keep silent like this
O Michael
because of himwhat other reason could there be
I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our livesfoolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith
I meet you now only as his widowI consider myself that and that I have no claim upon you
Had he not died I should never have comenever
Of that you may be sure
Tsss
How could you be so simple
I dont know
Yet it would have been very wickedif I had not thought like that
said Susan almost crying
Yesyesso it would
It is only that which makes me feel ee an innocent woman
Butto lead me into this
What Michael
she asked alarmed
Why this difficulty about our living together again and ElizabethJane
She cannot be told allshe would so despise us both thatI could not bear it
That was why she was brought up in ignorance of you
I could not bear it either
Wellwe must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief and getting matters straight in spite of it
You have heard I am in a large way of business herethat I am Mayor of the town and churchwarden and I dont know what all
Yes she murmured
These things as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace makes it necessary to act with extreme caution
So that I dont see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly and banished from me and theres the rub ot
Well go away at once
I only came to see No no Susan you are not to goyou mistake me
he said with kindly severity
I have thought of this plan that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs Newson and her daughter that I meet you court you and marry you
ElizabethJane coming to my house as my stepdaughter
The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking ot
This would leave my shady head strong disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened the secret would be yours and mine only and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof as well as my wife
I am quite in your hands Michael she said meekly
I came here for the sake of Elizabeth for myself if you tell me to leave again tomorrow morning and never come near you more I am content to go
Now now we dont want to hear that said Henchard gently
Of course you wont leave again
Think over the plan I have proposed for a few hours and if you cant hit upon a better one well adopt it
I have to be away for a day or two on business unfortunately but during that time you can get lodgingsthe only ones in the town fit for you are those over the chinashop in High Streetand you can also look for a cottage
If the lodgings are in High Street they are dear I suppose
Never mindyou MUST start genteel if our plan is to be carried out
Look to me for money
Have you enough till I come back
Quite said she
And are you comfortable at the inn
O yes
And the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and oursthats what makes me most anxious of all
You would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the truth
How could she ever suppose such a thing
True
I like the idea of repeating our marriage said Mrs Henchard after a pause
It seems the only right course after all this
Now I think I must go back to Elizabeth Jane and tell her that our kinsman Mr Henchard kindly wishes us to stay in the town
Very wellarrange that yourself
Ill go some way with you
No no
Dont run any risk
said his wife anxiously
I can find my way backit is not late
Please let me go alone
Right said Henchard
But just one word
Do you forgive me Susan
She murmured something but seemed to find it difficult to frame her answer
Never mindall in good time said he
Judge me by my future worksgoodbye
He retreated and stood at the upper side of the Amphitheatre while his wife passed out through the lower way and descended under the trees to the town
Then Henchard himself went homeward going so fast that by the time he reached his door he was almost upon the heels of the unconscious woman from whom he had just parted
He watched her up the street and turned into his house
12
On entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight the Mayor walked on through the tunnelshaped passage into the garden and thence by the back door towards the stores and granaries
A light shone from the officewindow and there being no blind to screen the interior Henchard could see Donald Farfrae still seated where he had left him initiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling the books
Henchard entered merely observing Dont let me interrupt you if ye will stay so late
He stood behind Farfraes chair watching his dexterity in clearing up the numerical fogs which had been allowed to grow so thick in Henchards books as almost to baffle even the Scotchmans perspicacity
The cornfactors mien was half admiring and yet it was not without a dash of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind to such finnikin details
Henchard himself was mentally and physically unfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper he had in a modern sense received the education of Achilles and found penmanship a tantalizing art
You shall do no more tonight he said at length spreading his great hand over the paper
Theres time enough tomorrow
Come indoors with me and have some supper
Now you shall
I am determined ont
He shut the accountbooks with friendly force
Donald had wished to get to his lodgings but he already saw that his friend and employer was a man who knew no moderation in his requests and impulses and he yielded gracefully
He liked Henchards warmth even if it inconvenienced him the great difference in their characters adding to the liking
They locked up the office and the young man followed his companion through the private little door which admitting directly into Henchards garden permitted a passage from the utilitarian to the beautiful at one step
The garden was silent dewy and full of perfume
It extended a long way back from the house first as lawn and flowerbeds then as fruitgarden where the longtied espaliers as old as the old house itself had grown so stout and cramped and gnarled that they had pulled their stakes out of the ground and stood distorted and writhing in vegetable agony like leafy Laocoons
The flowers which smelt so sweetly were not discernible and they passed through them into the house
The hospitalities of the morning were repeated and when they were over Henchard said Pull your chair round to the fireplace my dear fellow and lets make a blazetheres nothing I hate like a black grate even in September
He applied a light to the laidin fuel and a cheerful radiance spread around
It is odd said Henchard that two men should meet as we have done on a purely business ground and that at the end of the first day I should wish to speak to ee on a family matter
But damn it all I am a lonely man Farfrae I have nobody else to speak to and why shouldnt I tell it to ee
Ill be glad to hear it if I can be of any service said Donald allowing his eyes to travel over the intricate wood carvings of the chimneypiece representing garlanded lyres shields and quivers on either side of a draped oxskull and flanked by heads of Apollo and Diana in low relief
Ive not been always what I am now continued Henchard his firm deep voice being ever so little shaken
He was plainly under that strange influence which sometimes prompts men to confide to the newfound friend what they will not tell to the old
I began life as a working haytrusser and when I was eighteen I married on the strength o my calling
Would you think me a married man
I heard in the town that you were a widower
Ah yesyou would naturally have heard that
Well I lost my wife nineteen years ago or soby my own faultThis is how it came about
One summer evening I was travelling for employment and she was walking at my side carying the baby our only child
We came to a booth in a country fair
I was a drinking man at that time
Henchard paused a moment threw himself back so that his elbow rested on the table his forehead being shaded by his hand which however did not hide the marks of introspective inflexibility on his features as he narrated in fullest detail the incidents of the transaction with the sailor
The tinge of indifference which had at first been visible in the Scotchman now disappeared
Henchard went on to describe his attempts to find his wife the oath he swore the solitary life he led during the years which followed
I have kept my oath for nineteen years he went on I have risen to what you see me now
Ay
Wellno wife could I hear of in all that time and being by nature something of a womanhater I have found it no hardship to keep mostly at a distance from the sex
No wife could I hear of I say till this very day
And nowshe has come back
Come back has she
This morningthis very morning
And whats to be done
Can ye no take her and live with her and make some amends
Thats what Ive planned and proposed
But Farfrae said Henchard gloomily by doing right with Susan I wrong another innocent woman
Ye dont say that
In the nature of things Farfrae it is almost impossible that a man of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o life without making more blunders than one
It has been my custom for many years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business particularly in the potato and root season
I do a large trade wi them in that line
Well one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill and in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes suffer from on account o the loneliness of my domestic life when the world seems to have the blackness of hell and like Job I could curse the day that gave me birth
Ah now I never feel like it said Farfrae
Then pray to God that you never may young man
While in this state I was taken pity on by a womana young lady I should call her for she was of good family well bred and well educatedthe daughter of some harumscarum military officer who had got into difficulties and had his pay sequestrated
He was dead now and her mother too and she was as lonely as I
This young creature was staying at the boardinghouse where I happened to have my lodging and when I was pulled down she took upon herself to nurse me
From that she got to have a foolish liking for me
Heaven knows why for I wasnt worth it
But being together in the same house and her feeling warm we got naturally intimate
I wont go into particulars of what our relations were
It is enough to say that we honestly meant to marry
There arose a scandal which did me no harm but was of course ruin to her
Though Farfrae between you and me as man and man I solemnly declare that philandering with womankind has neither been my vice nor my virtue
She was terribly careless of appearances and I was perhaps more because o my dreary state and it was through this that the scandal arose
At last I was well and came away
When I was gone she suffered much on my account and didnt forget to tell me so in letters one after another till latterly I felt I owed her something and thought that as I had not heard of Susan for so long I would make this other one the only return I could make and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive very slight as I believed and marry me such as I was
She jumped for joy and we should no doubt soon have been marriedbut behold Susan appears
Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences
Now see what injury a man may cause around him
Even after that wrongdoing at the fair when I was young if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey to the injury of her name all might now be well
Yet as it stands I must bitterly disappoint one of these women and it is the second
My first duty is to Susantheres no doubt about that
They are both in a very melancholy position and thats true
murmured Donald
They are
For myself I dont caretwill all end one way
But these two
Henchard paused in reverie
I feel I should like to treat the second no less than the first as kindly as a man can in such a case
Ah well it cannet be helped
said the other with philosophic woefulness
You mun write to the young lady and in your letter you must put it plain and honest that it turns out she cannet be your wife the first having come back that ye cannet see her more and thatye wish her weel
That wont do
Od seize it I must do a little more than that
I mustthough she did always brag about her rich uncle or rich aunt and her expectations from emI must send a useful sum of money to her I supposejust as a little recompense poor girlNow will you help me in this and draw up an explanation to her of all Ive told ye breaking it as gently as you can
Im so bad at letters
And I will
Now I havent told you quite all yet
My wife Susan has my daughter with herthe baby that was in her arms at the fair and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage
She has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her mother and who is now dead was her father and her mothers husband
What her mother has always felt she and I together feel nowthat we cant proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth
Now what would you doI want your advice
I think Id run the risk and tell her the truth
Shell forgive ye both
Never
said Henchard
I am not going to let her know the truth
Her mother and I be going to marry again and it will not only help us to keep our childs respect but it will be more proper
Susan looks upon herself as the sailors widow and wont think o living with me as formerly without another religious ceremonyand shes right
Farfrae thereupon said no more
The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him and the interview ended Henchard saying as the Scotchman left I feel it a great relief Farfrae to tell some friend o this
You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket
I do
And Im sorry for ye
said Farfrae
When he was gone Henchard copied the letter and enclosing a cheque took it to the postoffice from which he walked back thoughtfully
Can it be that it will go off so easily
he said
Poor thingGod knows
Now then to make amends to Susan
13
The cottage which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her name of Newsonin pursuance of their planwas in the upper or western part of the town near the Roman wall and the avenue which overshadowed it
The evening sun seemed to shine more yellowly there than anywhere else this autumn stretching its rays as the hours grew later under the lowest sycamore boughs and steeping the groundfloor of the dwelling with its green shutters in a substratum of radiance which the foliage screened from the upper parts
Beneath these sycamores on the town walls could be seen from the sittingroom the tumuli and earth forts of the distant uplands making it altogether a pleasant spot with the usual touch of melancholy that a pastmarked prospect lends
As soon as the mother and daughter were comfortably installed with a whiteaproned servant and all complete Henchard paid them a visit and remained to tea
During the entertainment Elizabeth was carefully hoodwinked by the very general tone of the conversation that prevaileda proceeding which seemed to afford some humour to Henchard though his wife was not particularly happy in it
The visit was repeated again and again with businesslike determination by the Mayor who seemed to have schooled himself into a course of strict mechanical rightness towards this woman of prior claim at any expense to the later one and to his own sentiments
One afternoon the daughter was not indoors when Henchard came and he said drily This is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name the happy day Susan
The poor woman smiled faintly she did not enjoy pleasantries on a situation into which she had entered solely for the sake of her girls reputation
She liked them so little indeed that there was room for wonder why she had countenanced deception at all and had not bravely let the girl know her history
But the flesh is weak and the true explanation came in due course
O Michael
she said I am afraid all this is taking up your time and giving troublewhen I did not expect any such thing
And she looked at him and at his dress as a man of affluence and at the furniture he had provided for the roomornate and lavish to her eyes
Not at all said Henchard in rough benignity
This is only a cottageit costs me next to nothing
And as to taking up my timehere his red and black visage kindled with satisfactionIve a splendid fellow to superintend my business nowa man whose like Ive never been able to lay hands on before
I shall soon be able to leave everything to him and have more time to call my own than Ive had for these last twenty years
Henchards visits here grew so frequent and so regular that it soon became whispered and then openly discussed in Casterbridge that the masterful coercive Mayor of the town was raptured and enervated by the genteel widow Mrs Newson
His wellknown haughty indifference to the society of womankind his silent avoidance of converse with the sex contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic matter enough
That such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was inexplicable except on the ground that the engagement was a family affair in which sentimental passion had no place for it was known that they were related in some way
Mrs Henchard was so pale that the boys called her The Ghost
Sometimes Henchard overheard this epithet when they passed together along the Walksas the avenues on the walls were namedat which his face would darken with an expression of destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see but he said nothing
He pressed on the preparations for his union or rather reunion with this pale creature in a dogged unflinching spirit which did credit to his conscientiousness
Nobody would have conceived from his outward demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt great house nothing but three large resolvesone to make amends to his neglected Susan another to provide a comfortable home for ElizabethJane under his paternal eye and a third to castigate himself with the thorns which these restitutory acts brought in their train among them the lowering of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a woman
Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the weddingday to take her and Elizabeth Jane to church
It was a windless morning of warm November rain which floated down like meal and lay in a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats
Few people had gathered round the church door though they were well packed within
The Scotchman who assisted as groomsman was of course the only one present beyond the chief actors who knew the true situation of the contracting parties
He however was too inexperienced too thoughtful too judicial too strongly conscious of the serious side of the business to enter into the scene in its dramatic aspect
That required the special genius of Christopher Coney Solomon Longways Buzzford and their fellows
But they knew nothing of the secret though as the time for coming out of church drew on they gathered on the pavement adjoining and expounded the subject according to their lights
Tis fiveandforty years since I had my settlement in this here town said Coney but daze me if I ever see a man wait so long before to take so little
Theres a chance even for thee after this Nance Mockridge
The remark was addressed to a woman who stood behind his shoulderthe same who had exhibited Henchards bad bread in public when Elizabeth and her mother entered Casterbridge
Be cust if Id marry any such as he or thee either replied that lady
As for thee Christopher we know what ye be and the less said the better
And as for hewell therelowering her voice tis said a was a poor parish prenticeI wouldnt say it for all the worldbut a was a poor parish prentice that began life wi no more belonging to en than a carrion crow
And now hes worth ever so much a minute murmured Longways
When a man is said to be worth so much a minute hes a man to be considered
Turning he saw a circular disc reticulated with creases and recognized the smiling countenance of the fat woman who had asked for another song at the Three Mariners
Well Mother Cuxsom he said hows this
Heres Mrs Newson a mere skellinton has got another husband to keep her while a woman of your tonnage have not
I have not
Nor another to beat meAh yes Cuxsoms gone and so shall leather breeches
Yes with the blessing of God leather breeches shall go
Tisnt worth my old while to think of another husband continued Mrs Cuxsom
And yet Ill lay my life Im as respectable born as she
True your mother was a very good womanI can mind her
She were rewarded by the Agricultural Society for having begot the greatest number of healthy children without parish assistance and other virtuous marvels
Twas that that kept us so low upon groundthat great hungry family
Ay
Where the pigs be many the wash runs thin
And dostnt mind how mother would sing Christopher
continued Mrs Cuxsom kindling at the retrospection and how we went with her to the party at Mellstock do ye mind at old Dame Ledlows farmer Shinars aunt do ye mind she we used to call Toadskin because her face were so yaller and freckled do ye mind
I do heehee I do
said Christopher Coney
And well do Ifor I was getting up husbandhigh at that timeonehalf girl and tother half woman as one may say
And canst mindshe prodded Solomons shoulder with her fingertip while her eyes twinkled between the crevices of their lidscanst mind the sherrywine and the zilver snuffers and how Joan Dummett was took bad when we were coming home and Jack Griggs was forced to carry her through the mud and how a let her fall in Dairyman Sweetapples cowbarton and we had to clane her gown wi grassnever such a mess as a were in
Aythat I doheehee such doggery as there was in them ancient days to be sure
Ah the miles I used to walk then and now I can hardly step over a furrow
Their reminiscences were cut short by the appearance of the reunited pairHenchard looking round upon the idlers with that ambiguous gaze of his which at one moment seemed to mean satisfaction and at another fiery disdain
Welltheres a difference between em though he do call himself a teetotaller said Nance Mockridge
Shell wish her cake dough afore shes done of him
Theres a blue beardy look about en and twill out in time
Stuffhes well enough
Some folk want their luck buttered
If I had a choice as wide as the ocean sea I wouldnt wish for a better man
A poor twanking woman like hertis a godsend for her and hardly a pair of jumps or nightrail to her name
The plain little brougham drove off in the mist and the idlers dispersed
Well we hardly know how to look at things in these times
said Solomon
There was a man dropped down dead yesterday not so very many miles from here and what wi that and this moist weather tis scarce worth ones while to begin any work o consequence today
Im in such a low key with drinking nothing but small table ninepenny this last week or two that I shall call and warm up at the Marners as I pass along
I dont know but that I may as well go with ee Solomon said Christopher Im as clammy as a cocklesnail

A Martinmas summer of Mrs Henchards life set in with her entry into her husbands large house and respectable social orbit and it was as bright as such summers well can be
Lest she should pine for deeper affection than he could give he made a point of showing some semblance of it in external action
Among other things he had the iron railings that had smiled sadly in dull rust for the last eighty years painted a bright green and the heavybarred smallpaned Georgian sash windows enlivened with three coats of white
He was as kind to her as a man mayor and churchwarden could possibly be
The house was large the rooms lofty and the landings wide and the two unassuming women scarcely made a perceptible addition to its contents
To ElizabethJane the time was a most triumphant one
The freedom she experienced the indulgence with which she was treated went beyond her expectations
The reposeful easy affluent life to which her mothers marriage had introduced her was in truth the beginning of a great change in Elizabeth
She found she could have nice personal possessions and ornaments for the asking and as the mediaeval saying puts it Take have and keep are pleasant words
With peace of mind came development and with development beauty
Knowledgethe result of great natural insightshe did not lack learning accomplishment those alas she had not but as the winter and spring passed by her thin face and figure filled out in rounder and softer curves the lines and contractions upon her young brow went away the muddiness of skin which she had looked upon as her lot by nature departed with a change to abundance of good things and a bloom came upon her cheek
Perhaps too her grey thoughtful eyes revealed an arch gaiety sometimes but this was infrequent the sort of wisdom which looked from their pupils did not readily keep company with these lighter moods
Like all people who have known rough times lightheartedness seemed to her too irrational and inconsequent to be indulged in except as a reckless dram now and then for she had been too early habituated to anxious reasoning to drop the habit suddenly
She felt none of those ups and downs of spirit which beset so many people without cause neverto paraphrase a recent poetnever a gloom in ElizabethJanes soul but she well knew how it came there and her present cheerfulness was fairly proportionate to her solid guarantees for the same
It might have been supposed that given a girl rapidly becoming goodlooking comfortably circumstanced and for the first time in her life commanding ready money she would go and make a fool of herself by dress
But no
The reasonableness of almost everything that Elizabeth did was nowhere more conspicuous than in this question of clothes
To keep in the rear of opportunity in matters of indulgence is as valuable a habit as to keep abreast of opportunity in matters of enterprise
This unsophisticated girl did it by an innate perceptiveness that was almost genius
Thus she refrained from bursting out like a waterflower that spring and clothing herself in puffings and knickknacks as most of the Casterbridge girls would have done in her circumstances
Her triumph was tempered by circumspection she had still that fieldmouse fear of the coulter of destiny despite fair promise which is common among the thoughtful who have suffered early from poverty and oppression
I wont be too gay on any account she would say to herself
It would be tempting Providence to hurl mother and me down and afflict us again as He used to do
We now see her in a black silk bonnet velvet mantle or silk spencer dark dress and carrying a sunshade
In this latter article she drew the line at fringe and had it plain edged with a little ivory ring for keeping it closed
It was odd about the necessity for that sunshade
She discovered that with the clarification of her complexion and the birth of pink cheeks her skin had grown more sensitive to the suns rays
She protected those cheeks forthwith deeming spotlessness part of womanliness
Henchard had become very fond of her and she went out with him more frequently than with her mother now
Her appearance one day was so attractive that he looked at her critically
I happened to have the ribbon by me so I made it up she faltered thinking him perhaps dissatisfied with some rather bright trimming she had donned for the first time
Ayof courseto be sure he replied in his leonine way
Do as you likeor rather as your mother advises ye
Od sendIve nothing to say tot
Indoors she appeared with her hair divided by a parting that arched like a white rainbow from ear to ear
All in front of this line was covered with a thick encampment of curls all behind was dressed smoothly and drawn to a knob
The three members of the family were sitting at breakfast one day and Henchard was looking silently as he often did at this head of hair which in colour was brownrather light than dark
I thought ElizabethJanes hairdidnt you tell me that ElizabethJanes hair promised to be black when she was a baby
he said to his wife
She looked startled jerked his foot warningly and murmured Did I
As soon as Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard resumed
Begad I nearly forgot myself just now
What I meant was that the girls hair certainly looked as if it would be darker when she was a baby
It did but they alter so replied Susan
Their hair gets darker I knowbut I wasnt aware it lightened ever
O yes
And the same uneasy expression came out on her face to which the future held the key
It passed as Henchard went on Well so much the better
Now Susan I want to have her called Miss Henchardnot Miss Newson
Lots o people do it already in carelessnessit is her legal nameso it may as well be made her usual nameI dont like tother name at all for my own flesh and blood
Ill advertise it in the Casterbridge paperthats the way they do it
She wont object
No
O no
But Well then I shall do it he said peremptorily
Surely if shes willing you must wish it as much as I
O yesif she agrees let us do it by all means she replied
Then Mrs Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently it might have been called falsely but that her manner was emotional and full of the earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard
She went to ElizabethJane whom she found sewing in her own sittingroom upstairs and told her what had been proposed about her surname
Can you agreeis it not a slight upon Newsonnow hes dead and gone
Elizabeth reflected
Ill think of it mother she answered
When later in the day she saw Henchard she adverted to the matter at once in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her mother had been persevered in
Do you wish this change so very much sir
she asked
Wish it
Why my blessed fathers what an ado you women make about a trifle
I proposed itthats all
Now LizabethJane just please yourself
Curse me if I care what you do
Now you understand dont ee go agreeing to it to please me
Here the subject dropped and nothing more was said and nothing was done and Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson and not by her legal name
Meanwhile the great corn and hay traffic conducted by Henchard throve under the management of Donald Farfrae as it had never thriven before
It had formerly moved in jolts now it went on oiled casters
The old crude viva voce system of Henchard in which everything depended upon his memory and bargains were made by the tongue alone was swept away
Letters and ledgers took the place of Ill dot and you shall haet and as in all such cases of advance the rugged picturesqueness of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences
The position of ElizabethJanes roomrather high in the house so that it commanded a view of the haystores and granaries across the gardenafforded her opportunity for accurate observation of what went on there
She saw that Donald and Mr Henchard were inseparables
When walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his managers shoulder as if Farfrae were a younger brother bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight
Occasionally she would hear a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard arising from something Donald had said the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at all
In Henchards somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young man as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations
Donalds brightness of intellect maintained in the cornfactor the admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting
The poor opinion and but illconcealed that he entertained of the slim Farfraes physical girth strength and dash was more than counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains
Her quiet eye discerned that Henchards tigerish affection for the younger man his constant liking to have Farfrae near him now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer which however was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence
One day looking down on their figures from on high she heard the latter remark as they stood in the doorway between the garden and yard that their habit of walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfraes value as a second pair of eyes which should be used in places where the principal was not
Od damn it cried Henchard whats all the world
I like a fellow to talk to
Now come along and hae some supper and dont take too much thought about things or yell drive me crazy
When she walked with her mother on the other hand she often beheld the Scotchman looking at them with a curious interest
The fact that he had met her at the Three Mariners was insufficient to account for it since on the occasions on which she had entered his room he had never raised his eyes
Besides it was at her mother more particularly than at herself that he looked to Elizabeth Janes halfconscious simpleminded perhaps pardonable disappointment
Thus she could not account for this interest by her own attractiveness and she decided that it might be apparent onlya way of turning his eyes that Mr Farfrae had
She did not divine the ample explanation of his manner without personal vanity that was afforded by the fact of Donald being the depositary of Henchards confidence in respect of his past treatment of the pale chastened mother who walked by her side
Her conjectures on that past never went further than faint ones based on things casually heard and seenmere guesses that Henchard and her mother might have been lovers in their younger days who had quarrelled and parted
Casterbridge as has been hinted was a place deposited in the block upon a cornfield
There was no suburb in the modern sense or transitional intermixture of town and down
It stood with regard to the wide fertile land adjoining cleancut and distinct like a chessboard on a green tablecloth
The farmers boy could sit under his barleymow and pitch a stone into the officewindow of the townclerk reapers at work among the sheaves nodded to acquaintances standing on the pavementcorner the redrobed judge when he condemned a sheepstealer pronounced sentence to the tune of Baa that floated in at the window from the remainder of the flock browsing hard by and at executions the waiting crowd stood in a meadow immediately before the drop out of which the cows had been temporarily driven to give the spectators room
The corn grown on the upland side of the borough was garnered by farmers who lived in an eastern purlieu called Durnover
Here wheatricks overhung the old Roman street and thrust their eaves against the church tower green thatched barns with doorways as high as the gates of Solomons temple opened directly upon the main thoroughfare
Barns indeed were so numerous as to alternate with every halfdozen houses along the way
Here lived burgesses who daily walked the fallow shepherds in an intramural squeeze
A street of farmers homesteadsa street ruled by a mayor and corporation yet echoing with the thump of the flail the flutter of the winnowingfan and the purr of the milk into the pailsa street which had nothing urban in it whateverthis was the Durnover end of Casterbridge
Henchard as was natural dealt largely with this nursery or bed of small farmers close at handand his waggons were often down that way
One day when arrangements were in progress for getting home corn from one of the aforesaid farms ElizabethJane received a note by hand asking her to oblige the writer by coming at once to a granary on Durnover Hill
As this was the granary whose contents Henchard was removing she thought the request had something to do with his business and proceeded thither as soon as she had put on her bonnet
The granary was just within the farmyard and stood on stone staddles high enough for persons to walk under
The gates were open but nobody was within
However she entered and waited
Presently she saw a figure approaching the gatethat of Donald Farfrae
He looked up at the church clock and came in
By some unaccountable shyness some wish not to meet him there alone she quickly ascended the stepladder leading to the granary door and entered it before he had seen her
Farfrae advanced imagining himself in solitude and a few drops of rain beginning to fall he moved and stood under the shelter where she had just been standing
Here he leant against one of the staddles and gave himself up to patience
He too was plainly expecting some one could it be herself
If so why
In a few minutes he looked at his watch and then pulled out a note a duplicate of the one she had herself received
This situation began to be very awkward and the longer she waited the more awkward it became
To emerge from a door just above his head and descend the ladder and show she had been in hiding there would look so very foolish that she still waited on
A winnowing machine stood close beside her and to relieve her suspense she gently moved the handle whereupon a cloud of wheat husks flew out into her face and covered her clothes and bonnet and stuck into the fur of her victorine
He must have heard the slight movement for he looked up and then ascended the steps
Ahits Miss Newson he said as soon as he could see into the granary
I didnt know you were there
I have kept the appointment and am at your service
O Mr Farfrae she faltered so have I
But I didnt know it was you who wished to see me otherwise I I wished to see you
O noat least that is I am afraid there may be a mistake
Didnt you ask me to come here
Didnt you write this
Elizabeth held out her note
No
Indeed at no hand would I have thought of it
And for youdidnt you ask me
This is not your writing
And he held up his
By no means
And is that really so
Then its somebody wanting to see us both
Perhaps we would do well to wait a little longer
Acting on this consideration they lingered ElizabethJanes face being arranged to an expression of preternatural composure and the young Scot at every footstep in the street without looking from under the granary to see if the passer were about to enter and declare himself their summoner
They watched individual drops of rain creeping down the thatch of the opposite rickstraw after straw till they reached the bottom but nobody came and the granary roof began to drip
The person is not likely to be coming said Farfrae
Its a trick perhaps and if so its a great pity to waste our time like this and so much to be done
Tis a great liberty said Elizabeth
Its true Miss Newson
Well hear news of this some day depend ont and who it was that did it
I wouldnt stand for it hindering myself but you Miss Newson I dont mindmuch she replied
Neither do I
They lapsed again into silence
You are anxious to get back to Scotland I suppose Mr
Farfrae
she inquired
O no Miss Newson
Why would I be
I only supposed you might be from the song you sang at the Three Marinersabout Scotland and home I meanwhich you seemed to feel so deep down in your heart so that we all felt for you
Ayand I did sing thereI didBut Miss Newsonand Donalds voice musically undulated between two semitones as it always did when he became earnestits well you feel a song for a few minutes and your eyes they get quite tearful but you finish it and for all you felt you dont mind it or think of it again for a long while
O no I dont want to go back
Yet Ill sing the song to you wi pleasure whenever you like
I could sing it now and not mind at all
Thank you indeed
But I fear I must gorain or no
Ay
Then Miss Newson ye had better say nothing about this hoax and take no heed of it
And if the person should say anything to you be civil to him or her as if you did not mind itso youll take the clever persons laugh away
In speaking his eyes became fixed upon her dress still sown with wheat husks
Theres husks and dust on you
Perhaps you dont know it
he said in tones of extreme delicacy
And its very bad to let rain come upon clothes when theres chaff on them
It washes in and spoils them
Let me help youblowing is the best
As Elizabeth neither assented nor dissented Donald Farfrae began blowing her back hair and her side hair and her neck and the crown of her bonnet and the fur of her victorine Elizabeth saying O thank you at every puff
At last she was fairly clean though Farfrae having got over his first concern at the situation seemed in no manner of hurry to be gone
Ahnow Ill go and get ye an umbrella he said
She declined the offer stepped out and was gone
Farfrae walked slowly after looking thoughtfully at her diminishing figure and whistling in undertones As I came down through Cannobie
15
At first Miss Newsons budding beauty was not regarded with much interest by anybody in Casterbridge
Donald Farfraes gaze it is true was now attracted by the Mayors socalled stepdaughter but he was only one
The truth is that she was but a poor illustrative instance of the prophet Baruchs sly definition The virgin that loveth to go gay
When she walked abroad she seemed to be occupied with an inner chamber of ideas and to have slight need for visible objects
She formed curious resolves on checking gay fancies in the matter of clothes because it was inconsistent with her past life to blossom gaudily the moment she had become possessed of money
But nothing is more insidious than the evolution of wishes from mere fancies and of wants from mere wishes
Henchard gave ElizabethJane a box of delicatelytinted gloves one spring day
She wanted to wear them to show her appreciation of his kindness but she had no bonnet that would harmonize
As an artistic indulgence she thought she would have such a bonnet
When she had a bonnet that would go with the gloves she had no dress that would go with the bonnet
It was now absolutely necessary to finish she ordered the requisite article and found that she had no sunshade to go with the dress
In for a penny in for a pound she bought the sunshade and the whole structure was at last complete
Everybody was attracted and some said that her bygone simplicity was the art that conceals art the delicate imposition of Rochefoucauld she had produced an effect a contrast and it had been done on purpose
As a matter of fact this was not true but it had its result for as soon as Casterbridge thought her artful it thought her worth notice
It is the first time in my life that I have been so much admired she said to herself though perhaps it is by those whose admiration is not worth having
But Donald Farfrae admired her too and altogether the time was an exciting one sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly for in former days she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be distinctively feminine
After an unprecedented success one day she came indoors went upstairs and leant upon her bed face downwards quite forgetting the possible creasing and damage
Good Heaven she whispered can it be
Here am I setting up as the town beauty
When she had thought it over her usual fear of exaggerating appearances engendered a deep sadness
There is something wrong in all this she mused
If they only knew what an unfinished girl I amthat I cant talk Italian or use globes or show any of the accomplishments they learn at boarding schools how they would despise me
Better sell all this finery and buy myself grammarbooks and dictionaries and a history of all the philosophies
She looked from the window and saw Henchard and Farfrae in the hayyard talking with that impetuous cordiality on the Mayors part and genial modesty on the younger mans that was now so generally observable in their intercourse
Friendship between man and man what a rugged strength there was in it as evinced by these two
And yet the seed that was to lift the foundation of this friendship was at that moment taking root in a chink of its structure
It was about six oclock the men were dropping off homeward one by one
The last to leave was a roundshouldered blinking young man of nineteen or twenty whose mouth fell ajar on the slightest provocation seemingly because there was no chin to support it
Henchard called aloud to him as he went out of the gate HereAbel Whittle
Whittle turned and ran back a few steps
Yes sir he said in breathless deprecation as if he knew what was coming next
Once morebe in time tomorrow morning
You see whats to be done and you hear what I say and you know Im not going to be trifled with any longer
Yes sir
Then Abel Whittle left and Henchard and Farfrae and Elizabeth saw no more of them
Now there was good reason for this command on Henchards part
Poor Abel as he was called had an inveterate habit of oversleeping himself and coming late to his work
His anxious will was to be among the earliest but if his comrades omitted to pull the string that he always tied round his great toe and left hanging out the window for that purpose his will was as wind
He did not arrive in time
As he was often second hand at the hayweighing or at the crane which lifted the sacks or was one of those who had to accompany the waggons into the country to fetch away stacks that had been purchased this affliction of Abels was productive of much inconvenience
For two mornings in the present week he had kept the others waiting nearly an hour hence Henchards threat
It now remained to be seen what would happen tomorrow
Six oclock struck and there was no Whittle
At halfpast six Henchard entered the yard the waggon was horsed that Abel was to accompany and the other man had been waiting twenty minutes
Then Henchard swore and Whittle coming up breathless at that instant the cornfactor turned on him and declared with an oath that this was the last time that if he were behind once more by God he would come and drag him out o bed
There is sommit wrong in my make your worshipful
said Abel especially in the inside whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as a clot afore Ive said my few scrags of prayers
Yesit came on as a stripling just afore Id got mans wages whereas I never enjoy my bed at all for no sooner do I lie down than I be asleep and afore I be awake I be up
Ive fretted my gizzard green about it maister but what can I do
Now last night afore I went to bed I only had a scantling o cheese and I dont want to hear it
roared Henchard
Tomorrow the waggons must start at four and if youre not here stand clear
Ill mortify thy flesh for thee
But let me clear up my points your worshipful Henchard turned away
He asked me and he questioned me and then a wouldnt hear my points
said Abel to the yard in general
Now I shall twitch like a momenthand all night tonight for fear o him
The journey to be taken by the waggons next day was a long one into Blackmoor Vale and at four oclock lanterns were moving about the yard
But Abel was missing
Before either of the other men could run to Abels and warn him Henchard appeared in the garden doorway
Wheres Abel Whittle
Not come after all Ive said
Now Ill carry out my word by my blessed fathersnothing else will do him any good
Im going up that way
Henchard went off entered Abels house a little cottage in Back Street the door of which was never locked because the inmates had nothing to lose
Reaching Whittles bedside the cornfactor shouted a bass note so vigorously that Abel started up instantly and beholding Henchard standing over him was galvanized into spasmodic movements which had not much relation to getting on his clothes
Out of bed sir and off to the granary or you leave my employ today
Tis to teach ye a lesson
March on never mind your breeches
The unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat and managed to get into his boots at the bottom of the stairs while Henchard thrust his hat over his head
Whittle then trotted on down Back Street Henchard walking sternly behind
Just at this time Farfrae who had been to Henchards house to look for him came out of the back gate and saw something white fluttering in the morning gloom which he soon perceived to be part of Abels shirt that showed below his waistcoat
For maircys sake what objects this
said Farfrae following Abel into the yard Henchard being some way in the rear by this time
Ye see Mr Farfrae gibbered Abel with a resigned smile of terror he said hed mortify my flesh if so be I didnt get up sooner and now hes adoing ont
Ye see it cant be helped Mr Farfrae things do happen queer sometimes
Yes Ill go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as I be since he do command but I shall kill myself afterwards I cant outlive the disgrace for the womenfolk will be looking out of their winders at my mortification all the way along and laughing me to scorn as a man ithout breeches
You know how I feel such things Maister Farfrae and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me
YesI shall do myself harmI feel it coming on
Get back home and slip on your breeches and come to wark like a man
If ye go not youll hae your death standing there
Im afeard I mustnt
Mr Henchard said I dont care what Mr Henchard said nor anybody else
Tis simple foolishness to do this
Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle
Hullo hullo
said Henchard coming up behind
Whos sending him back
All the men looked towards Farfrae
I am said Donald
I say this joke has been carried far enough
And I say it hasnt
Get up in the waggon Whittle
Not if I am manager said Farfrae
He either goes home or I march out of this yard for good
Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red
But he paused for a moment and their eyes met
Donald went up to him for he saw in Henchards look that he began to regret this
Come said Donald quietly a man o your position should ken better sir
It is tyrannical and no worthy of you
Tis not tyrannical
murmured Henchard like a sullen boy
It is to make him remember
He presently added in a tone of one bitterly hurt Why did you speak to me before them like that Farfrae
You might have stopped till we were alone
AhI know why
Ive told ye the secret o my life fool that I was to dotand you take advantage of me
I had forgot it said Farfrae simply
Henchard looked on the ground said nothing more and turned away
During the day Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept Abels old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter which made him less antagonistic to the cornfactor
But Henchard continued moody and silent and when one of the men inquired of him if some oats should be hoisted to an upper floor or not he said shortly Ask Mr Farfrae
Hes master here
Morally he was there could be no doubt of it
Henchard who had hitherto been the most admired man in his circle was the most admired no longer
One day the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover wanted an opinion of the value of their haystack and sent a messenger to ask Mr Farfrae to oblige them with one
The messenger who was a child met in the yard not Farfrae but Henchard
Very well he said
Ill come
But please will Mr Farfrae come
said the child
I am going that wayWhy Mr
Farfrae
said Henchard with the fixed look of thought
Why do people always want Mr
Farfrae
I suppose because they like him sothats what they say
OhI seethats what they sayhey
They like him because hes cleverer than Mr Henchard and because he knows more and in short Mr Henchard cant hold a candle to him hey
Yesthats just it sirsome of it
Oh theres more
Of course theres more
What besides
Come heres a sixpence for a fairing
And hes better tempered and Henchards a fool to him they say
And when some of the women were awalking home they said Hes a dimenthes a chap o waxhes the besthes the horse for my money says they
And they said Hes the most understanding man o them two by long chalks
I wish he was the master instead of Henchard they said
Theyll talk any nonsense Henchard replied with covered gloom
Well you can go now
And I am coming to value the hay dye hearI
The boy departed and Henchard murmured Wish he were master here do they
He went towards Durnover
On his way he overtook Farfrae
They walked on together Henchard looking mostly on the ground
Youre no yoursel the day
Donald inquired
Yes I am very well said Henchard
But ye are a bit downsurely ye are down
Why theres nothing to be angry about
Tis splendid stuff that weve got from Blackmoor Vale
By the by the people in Durnover want their hay valued
Yes
I am going there
Ill go with ye
As Henchard did not reply Donald practised a piece of music sotto voce till getting near the bereaved peoples door he stopped himself with Ah as their father is dead I wont go on with such as that
How could I forget
Do you care so very much about hurting folks feelings
observed Henchard with a half sneer
You do I know especially mine
I am sorry if I have hurt yours sir replied Donald standing still with a second expression of the same sentiment in the regretfulness of his face
Why should you say itthink it
The cloud lifted from Henchards brow and as Donald finished the cornmerchant turned to him regarding his breast rather than his face
I have been hearing things that vexed me he said
Twas that made me short in my mannermade me overlook what you really are
Now I dont want to go in here about this hay Farfrae you can do it better than I
They sent for ee too
I have to attend a meeting of the Town Council at eleven and tis drawing on fort
They parted thus in renewed friendship Donald forbearing to ask Henchard for meanings that were not very plain to him
On Henchards part there was now again repose and yet whenever he thought of Farfrae it was with a dim dread and he often regretted that he had told the young man his whole heart and confided to him the secrets of his life
16
On this account Henchards manner towards Farfrae insensibly became more reserved
He was courteoustoo courteousand Farfrae was quite surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined if warm and sincere
The cornfactor seldom or never again put his arm upon the young mans shoulder so as to nearly weigh him down with the pressure of mechanized friendship
He left off coming to Donalds lodgings and shouting into the passage
Hoy Farfrae boy come and have some dinner with us
Dont sit here in solitary confinement
But in the daily routine of their business there was little change
Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place
For some time Casterbridge by nature slow made no response
Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rickcloths to himself and a few others who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named and required a shelter for the same to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head
Have as many cloths as you like Henchard replied
When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation
It certainly had been very remiss of him as Mayor he thought to call no meeting ere this to discuss what should be done on this holiday
But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give old fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative
However it was not too late and on second thoughts he determined to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some amusements if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his hands
To this they quite readily agreed the majority being fine old crusted characters who had a decided taste for living without worry
So Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant thingsuch as should be worthy of the venerable town
As for Farfraes little affair Henchard nearly forgot it except once now and then when on it coming into his mind he said to himself Charge admission at so much a headjust like a Scotchmanwho is going to pay anything a head
The diversions which the Mayor intended to provide were to be entirely free
He had grown so dependent upon Donald that he could scarcely resist calling him in to consult
But by sheer self coercion he refrained
No he thought Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned luminous way that in spite of himself he Henchard would sink to the position of second fiddle and only scrape harmonies to his managers talents
Everybody applauded the Mayors proposed entertainment especially when it became known that he meant to pay for it all himself
Close to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient square earthworkearthworks square and not square were as common as blackberries hereabouta spot whereon the Casterbridge people usually held any kind of merrymaking meeting or sheepfair that required more space than the streets would afford
On one side it sloped to the river Froom and from any point a view was obtained of the country round for many miles
This pleasant upland was to be the scene of Henchards exploit
He advertised about the town in long posters of a pink colour that games of all sorts would take place here and set to work a little battalion of men under his own eye
They erected greasypoles for climbing with smoked hams and local cheeses at the top
They placed hurdles in rows for jumping over across the river they laid a slippery pole with a live pig of the neighbourhood tied at the other end to become the property of the man who could walk over and get it
There were also provided wheelbarrows for racing donkeys for the same a stage for boxing wrestling and drawing blood generally sacks for jumping in
Moreover not forgetting his principles Henchard provided a mammoth tea of which everybody who lived in the borough was invited to partake without payment
The tables were laid parallel with the inner slope of the rampart and awnings were stretched overhead
Passing to and fro the Mayor beheld the unattractive exterior of Farfraes erection in the West Walk rickcloths of different sizes and colours being hung up to the arching trees without any regard to appearance
He was easy in his mind now for his own preparations far transcended these
The morning came
The sky which had been remarkably clear down to within a day or two was overcast and the weather threatening the wind having an unmistakable hint of water in it
Henchard wished he had not been quite so sure about the continuance of a fair season
But it was too late to modify or postpone and the proceedings went on
At twelve oclock the rain began to fall small and steady commencing and increasing so insensibly that it was difficult to state exactly when dry weather ended or wet established itself
In an hour the slight moisture resolved itself into a monotonous smiting of earth by heaven in torrents to which no end could be prognosticated
A number of people had heroically gathered in the field but by three oclock Henchard discerned that his project was doomed to end in failure
The hams at the top of the poles dripped watered smoke in the form of a brown liquor the pig shivered in the wind the grain of the deal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths for the awning allowed the rain to drift under at its will and to enclose the sides at this hour seemed a useless undertaking
The landscape over the river disappeared the wind played on the tentcords in aeolian improvisations and at length rose to such a pitch that the whole erection slanted to the ground those who had taken shelter within it having to crawl out on their hands and knees
But towards six the storm abated and a drier breeze shook the moisture from the grass bents
It seemed possible to carry out the programme after all
The awning was set up again the band was called out from its shelter and ordered to begin and where the tables had stood a place was cleared for dancing
But where are the folk
said Henchard after the lapse of halfanhour during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to dance
The shops are all shut
Why dont they come
They are at Farfraes affair in the West Walk answered a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor
A few I suppose
But where are the body o em
All out of doors are there
Then the more fools they
Henchard walked away moodily
One or two young fellows gallantly came to climb the poles to save the hams from being wasted but as there were no spectators and the whole scene presented the most melancholy appearance Henchard gave orders that the proceedings were to be suspended and the entertainment closed the food to be distributed among the poor people of the town
In a short time nothing was left in the field but a few hurdles the tents and the poles
Henchard returned to his house had tea with his wife and daughter and then walked out
It was now dusk
He soon saw that the tendency of all promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks and eventually proceeded thither himself
The notes of a stringed band came from the enclosure that Farfrae had erectedthe pavilion as he called itand when the Mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes
The densest point of the avenue of sycamores had been selected where the boughs made a closely interlaced vault overhead to these boughs the canvas had been hung and a barrel roof was the result
The end towards the wind was enclosed the other end was open
Henchard went round and saw the interior
In form it was like the nave of a cathedral with one gable removed but the scene within was anything but devotional
A reel or fling of some sort was in progress and the usually sedate Farfrae was in the midst of the other dancers in the costume of a wild Highlander flinging himself about and spinning to the tune
For a moment Henchard could not help laughing
Then he perceived the immense admiration for the Scotchman that revealed itself in the womens faces and when this exhibition was over and a new dance proposed and Donald had disappeared for a time to return in his natural garments he had an unlimited choice of partners every girl being in a comingon disposition towards one who so thoroughly understood the poetry of motion as he
All the town crowded to the Walk such a delightful idea of a ballroom never having occurred to the inhabitants before
Among the rest of the onlookers were Elizabeth and her motherthe former thoughtful yet much interested her eyes beaming with a longing lingering light as if Nature had been advised by Correggio in their creation
The dancing progressed with unabated spirit and Henchard walked and waited till his wife should be disposed to go home
He did not care to keep in the light and when he went into the dark it was worse for there he heard remarks of a kind which were becoming too frequent Mr Henchards rejoicings couldnt say good morning to this said one
A man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that bleak place today
The other answered that people said it was not only in such things as those that the Mayor was wanting
Where would his business be if it were not for this young fellow
Twas verily Fortune sent him to Henchard
His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr Farfrae came
He used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like gardenpalings measure his ricks by stretching with his arms weigh his trusses by a lift judge his hay by a chaw and settle the price with a curse
But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration
Then the wheat that sometimes used to taste so strong o mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breedFarfrae has a plan for purifying so that nobody would dream the smallest fourlegged beast had walked over it once
O yes everybody is full of him and the care Mr Henchard has to keep him to be sure
concluded this gentleman
But he wont do it for long goodnow said the other
No
said Henchard to himself behind the tree
Or if he do hell be honeycombed clean out of all the character and standing that hes built up in these eighteen year
He went back to the dancing pavilion
Farfrae was footing a quaint little dance with ElizabethJanean old country thing the only one she knew and though he considerately toned down his movements to suit her demurer gait the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of his boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander
The tune had enticed her into it being a tune of a busy vaulting leaping sortsome low notes on the silver string of each fiddle then a skipping on the small like running up and down laddersMiss MLeod of Ayr was its name so Mr Farfrae had said and that it was very popular in his own country
It was soon over and the girl looked at Henchard for approval but he did not give it
He seemed not to see her
Look here Farfrae he said like one whose mind was elsewhere Ill go to PortBredy Great Market tomorrow myself
You can stay and put things right in your clothes box and recover strength to your knees after your vagaries
He planted on Donald an antagonistic glare that had begun as a smile
Some other townsmen came up and Donald drew aside
Whats this Henchard said Alderman Tubber applying his thumb to the cornfactor like a cheesetaster
An opposition randy to yours eh
Jacks as good as his master eh
Cut ye out quite hasnt he
You see Mr Henchard said the lawyer another good natured friend where you made the mistake was in going so far afield
You should have taken a leaf out of his book and have had your sports in a sheltered place like this
But you didnt think of it you see and he did and thats where hes beat you
Hell be topsawyer soon of you two and carry all afore him added jocular Mr Tubber
No said Henchard gloomily
He wont be that because hes shortly going to leave me
He looked towards Donald who had come near
Mr Farfraes time as my manager is drawing to a closeisnt it Farfrae
The young man who could now read the lines and folds of Henchards stronglytraced face as if they were clear verbal inscriptions quietly assented and when people deplored the fact and asked why it was he simply replied that Mr Henchard no longer required his help
Henchard went home apparently satisfied
But in the morning when his jealous temper had passed away his heart sank within him at what he had said and done
He was the more disturbed when he found that this time Farfrae was determined to take him at his word
17
ElizabethJane had perceived from Henchards manner that in assenting to dance she had made a mistake of some kind
In her simplicity she did not know what it was till a hint from a nodding acquaintance enlightened her
As the Mayors stepdaughter she learnt she had not been quite in her place in treading a measure amid such a mixed throng as filled the dancing pavilion
Thereupon her ears cheeks and chin glowed like live coals at the dawning of the idea that her tastes were not good enough for her position and would bring her into disgrace
This made her very miserable and she looked about for her mother but Mrs Henchard who had less idea of conventionality than Elizabeth herself had gone away leaving her daughter to return at her own pleasure
The latter moved on into the dark dense old avenues or rather vaults of living woodwork which ran along the town boundary and stood reflecting
A man followed in a few minutes and her face being towards the shine from the tent he recognized her
It was Farfrae just come from the dialogue with Henchard which had signified his dismissal
And its you Miss Newsonand Ive been looking for ye everywhere
he said overcoming a sadness imparted by the estrangement with the cornmerchant
May I walk on with you as far as your streetcorner
She thought there might be something wrong in this but did not utter any objection
So together they went on first down the West Walk and then into the Bowling Walk till Farfrae said Its like that Im going to leave you soon
She faltered Why
Ohas a mere matter of businessnothing more
But well not concern ourselves about itit is for the best
I hoped to have another dance with you
She said she could not dancein any proper way
Nay but you do
Its the feeling for it rather than the learning of steps that makes pleasant dancersI fear I offended your father by getting up this
And now perhaps Ill have to go to another part o the warrld altogether
This seemed such a melancholy prospect that ElizabethJane breathed a sighletting it off in fragments that he might not hear her
But darkness makes people truthful and the Scotchman went on impulsivelyperhaps he had heard her after all I wish I was richer Miss Newson and your stepfather had not been offended I would ask you something in a short timeyes I would ask you tonight
But thats not for me
What he would have asked her he did not say and instead of encouraging him she remained incompetently silent
Thus afraid one of another they continued their promenade along the walls till they got near the bottom of the Bowling Walk twenty steps further and the trees would end and the streetcorner and lamps appear
In consciousness of this they stopped
I never found out who it was that sent us to Durnover granary on a fools errand that day said Donald in his undulating tones
Did ye ever know yourself Miss Newson
Never said she
I wonder why they did it
For fun perhaps
Perhaps it was not for fun
It might have been that they thought they would like us to stay waiting there talking to one another
Ay well
I hope you Casterbridge folk will not forget me if I go
That Im sure we wont
she said earnestly
Iwish you wouldnt go at all
They had got into the lamplight
Now Ill think over that said Donald Farfrae
And Ill not come up to your door but part from you here lest it make your father more angry still
They parted Farfrae returning into the dark Bowling Walk and ElizabethJane going up the street
Without any consciousness of what she was doing she started running with all her might till she reached her fathers door
O dear mewhat am I at
she thought as she pulled up breathless
Indoors she fell to conjecturing the meaning of Farfraes enigmatic words about not daring to ask her what he fain would
Elizabeth that silent observing woman had long noted how he was rising in favour among the townspeople and knowing Henchards nature now she had feared that Farfraes days as manager were numbered so that the announcement gave her little surprise
Would Mr Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his words and her fathers dismissal
His occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect
The next day was windyso windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfraes writing which had flown over the wall from the office
The useless scrap she took indoors and began to copy the calligraphy which she much admired
The letter began Dear Sir and presently writing on a loose slip ElizabethJane she laid the latter over Sir making the phrase Dear ElizabethJane
When she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through though nobody was there to see what she had done
She quickly tore up the slip and threw it away
After this she grew cool and laughed at herself walked about the room and laughed again not joyfully but distressfully rather
It was quickly known in Casterbridge that Farfrae and Henchard had decided to dispense with each other
ElizabethJanes anxiety to know if Farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed her for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause
At length the news reached her that he was not going to leave the place
A man following the same trade as Henchard but on a very small scale had sold his business to Farfrae who was forthwith about to start as corn and hay merchant on his own account
Her heart fluttered when she heard of this step of Donalds proving that he meant to remain and yet would a man who cared one little bit for her have endangered his suit by setting up a business in opposition to Mr Henchards
Surely not and it must have been a passing impulse only which had led him to address her so softly
To solve the problem whether her appearance on the evening of the dance were such as to inspire a fleeting love at first sight she dressed herself up exactly as she had dressed thenthe muslin the spencer the sandals the parasoland looked in the mirror The picture glassed back was in her opinion precisely of such a kind as to inspire that fleeting regard and no morejust enough to make him silly and not enough to keep him so she said luminously and Elizabeth thought in a much lower key that by this time he had discovered how plain and homely was the informing spirit of that pretty outside
Hence when she felt her heart going out to him she would say to herself with a mock pleasantry that carried an ache with it No no ElizabethJanesuch dreams are not for you
She tried to prevent herself from seeing him and thinking of him succeeding fairly well in the former attempt in the latter not so completely
Henchard who had been hurt at finding that Farfrae did not mean to put up with his temper any longer was incensed beyond measure when he learnt what the young man had done as an alternative
It was in the townhall after a council meeting that he first became aware of Farfraes coup for establishing himself independently in the town and his voice might have been heard as far as the townpump expressing his feelings to his fellow councilmen
These tones showed that though under a long reign of selfcontrol he had become Mayor and churchwarden and what not there was still the same unruly volcanic stuff beneath the rind of Michael Henchard as when he had sold his wife at Weydon Fair
Well hes a friend of mine and Im a friend of hisor if we are not what are we
Od send if Ive not been his friend who has I should like to know
Didnt he come here without a sound shoe to his voot
Didnt I keep him here help him to a living
Didnt I help him to money or whatever he wanted
I stuck out for no termsI said Name your own price
Id have shared my last crust with that young fellow at one time I liked him so well
And now hes defied me
But damn him Ill have a tussle with him nowat fair buying and selling mindat fair buying and selling
And if I cant overbid such a stripling as he then Im not woth a varden
Well show that we know our business as well as one here and there
His friends of the Corporation did not specially respond
Henchard was less popular now than he had been when nearly two years before they had voted him to the chief magistracy on account of his amazing energy
While they had collectively profited by this quality of the cornfactors they had been made to wince individually on more than one occasion
So he went out of the hall and down the street alone
Reaching home he seemed to recollect something with a sour satisfaction
He called ElizabethJane
Seeing how he looked when she entered she appeared alarmed
Nothing to find fault with he said observing her concern
Only I want to caution you my dear
That man Farfraeit is about him
Ive seen him talking to you two or three timeshe danced with ee at the rejoicings and came home with ee
Now now no blame to you
But just harken Have you made him any foolish promise
Gone the least bit beyond sniff and snaff at all
No
I have promised him nothing
Good
Alls well that ends well
I particularly wish you not to see him again
Very well sir
You promise
She hesitated for a moment and then said Yes if you much wish it
I do
Hes an enemy to our house
When she had gone he sat down and wrote in a heavy hand to Farfrae thus SIRI make request that henceforth you and my step daughter be as strangers to each other
She on her part has promised to welcome no more addresses from you and I trust therefore you will not attempt to force them upon her
M HENCHARD One would almost have supposed Henchard to have had policy to see that no better modus vivendi could be arrived at with Farfrae than by encouraging him to become his sonin law
But such a scheme for buying over a rival had nothing to recommend it to the Mayors headstrong faculties
With all domestic finesse of that kind he was hopelessly at variance
Loving a man or hating him his diplomacy was as wrongheaded as a buffalos and his wife had not ventured to suggest the course which she for many reasons would have welcomed gladly
Meanwhile Donald Farfrae had opened the gates of commerce on his own account at a spot on Durnover Hillas far as possible from Henchards stores and with every intention of keeping clear of his former friend and employers customers
There was it seemed to the younger man room for both of them and to spare
The town was small but the corn and haytrade was proportionately large and with his native sagacity he saw opportunity for a share of it
So determined was he to do nothing which should seem like tradeantagonism to the Mayor that he refused his first customera large farmer of good reputebecause Henchard and this man had dealt together within the preceding three months
He was once my friend said Farfrae and its not for me to take business from him
I am sorry to disappoint you but I cannot hurt the trade of a man whos been so kind to me
In spite of this praiseworthy course the Scotchmans trade increased
Whether it were that his northern energy was an overmastering force among the easygoing Wessex worthies or whether it was sheer luck the fact remained that whatever he touched he prospered in
Like Jacob in PadanAram he would no sooner humbly limit himself to the ringstrakedand spotted exceptions of trade than the ringstrakedandspotted would multiply and prevail
But most probably luck had little to do with it
Character is Fate said Novalis and Farfraes character was just the reverse of Henchards who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been describedas a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way
Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to ElizabethJane
His acts of that kind had been so slight that the request was almost superfluous
Yet he had felt a considerable interest in her and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well to enact no Romeo part just thenfor the young girls sake no less than his own
Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down
A time came when avoid collision with his former friend as he might Farfrae was compelled in sheer selfdefence to close with Henchard in mortal commercial combat
He could no longer parry the fierce attacks of the latter by simple avoidance
As soon as their war of prices began everybody was interested and some few guessed the end
It was in some degree Northern insight matched against Southern doggednessthe dirk against the cudgeland Henchards weapon was one which if it did not deal ruin at the first or second stroke left him afterwards wellnigh at his antagonists mercy
Almost every Saturday they encountered each other amid the crowd of farmers which thronged about the marketplace in the weekly course of their business
Donald was always ready and even anxious to say a few friendly words but the Mayor invariably gazed stormfully past him like one who had endured and lost on his account and could in no sense forgive the wrong nor did Farfraes snubbed manner of perplexity at all appease him
The large farmers corn merchants millers auctioneers and others had each an official stall in the cornmarket room with their names painted thereon and when to the familiar series of Henchard Everdene Shiner Darton and so on was added one inscribed Farfrae in staring new letters Henchard was stung into bitterness like Bellerophon he wandered away from the crowd cankered in soul
From that day Donald Farfraes name was seldom mentioned in Henchards house
If at breakfast or dinner Elizabeth Janes mother inadvertently alluded to her favourites movements the girl would implore her by a look to be silent and her husband would say Whatare you too my enemy
18
There came a shock which had been foreseen for some time by Elizabeth as the box passenger foresees the approaching jerk from some channel across the highway
Her mother was illtoo unwell to leave her room
Henchard who treated her kindly except in moments of irritation sent at once for the richest busiest doctor whom he supposed to be the best
Bedtime came and they burnt a light all night
In a day or two she rallied
Elizabeth who had been staying up did not appear at breakfast on the second morning and Henchard sat down alone
He was startled to see a letter for him from Jersey in a writing he knew too well and had expected least to behold again
He took it up in his hands and looked at it as at a picture a vision a vista of past enactments and then he read it as an unimportant finale to conjecture
The writer said that she at length perceived how impossible it would be for any further communications to proceed between them now that his remarriage had taken place
That such reunion had been the only straightforward course open to him she was bound to admit
On calm reflection therefore she went on I quite forgive you for landing me in such a dilemma remembering that you concealed nothing before our illadvised acquaintance and that you really did set before me in your grim way the fact of there being a certain risk in intimacy with you slight as it seemed to be after fifteen or sixteen years of silence on your wifes part
I thus look upon the whole as a misfortune of mine and not a fault of yours
So that Michael I must ask you to overlook those letters with which I pestered you day after day in the heat of my feelings
They were written whilst I thought your conduct to me cruel but now I know more particulars of the position you were in I see how inconsiderate my reproaches were
Now you will I am sure perceive that the one condition which will make any future happiness possible for me is that the past connection between our lives be kept secret outside this isle
Speak of it I know you will not and I can trust you not to write of it
One safeguard more remains to be mentionedthat no writings of mine or trifling articles belonging to me should be left in your possession through neglect or forgetfulness
To this end may I request you to return to me any such you may have particularly the letters written in the first abandonment of feeling
For the handsome sum you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound I heartily thank you
I am now on my way to Bristol to see my only relative
She is rich and I hope will do something for me
I shall return through Casterbridge and Budmouth where I shall take the packetboat
Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles
I shall be in the coach which changes horses at the Antelope Hotel at halfpast five Wednesday evening I shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre and thus may easily be found
I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them sentI remain still yours ever LUCETTA Henchard breathed heavily
Poor thingbetter you had not known me
Upon my heart and soul if ever I should be left in a position to carry out that marriage with thee I OUGHT to do itI ought to do it indeed
The contingency that he had in his mind was of course the death of Mrs Henchard
As requested he sealed up Lucettas letters and put the parcel aside till the day she had appointed this plan of returning them by hand being apparently a little ruse of the young lady for exchanging a word or two with him on past times
He would have preferred not to see her but deeming that there could be no great harm in acquiescing thus far he went at dusk and stood opposite the coachoffice
The evening was chilly and the coach was late
Henchard crossed over to it while the horses were being changed but there was no Lucetta inside or out
Concluding that something had happened to modify her arrangements he gave the matter up and went home not without a sense of relief
Meanwhile Mrs Henchard was weakening visibly
She could not go out of doors any more
One day after much thinking which seemed to distress her she said she wanted to write something
A desk was put upon her bed with pen and paper and at her request she was left alone
She remained writing for a short time folded her paper carefully called ElizabethJane to bring a taper and wax and then still refusing assistance sealed up the sheet directed it and locked it in her desk
She had directed it in these words MR MICHAEL HENCHARD
NOT TO BE OPENED TILL ELIZABETH JANES WEDDINGDAY
The latter sat up with her mother to the utmost of her strength night after night
To learn to take the universe seriously there is no quicker way than to watchto be a waker as the countrypeople call it
Between the hours at which the last tosspot went by and the first sparrow shook himself the silence in Casterbridgebarring the rare sound of the watchmanwas broken in Elizabeths ear only by the timepiece in the bedroom ticking frantically against the clock on the stairs ticking harder and harder till it seemed to clang like a gong and all this while the subtle souled girl asking herself why she was born why sitting in a room and blinking at the candle why things around her had taken the shape they wore in preference to every other possible shape
Why they stared at her so helplessly as if waiting for the touch of some wand that should release them from terrestrial constraint what that chaos called consciousness which spun in her at this moment like a top tended to and began in
Her eyes fell together she was awake yet she was asleep
A word from her mother roused her
Without preface and as the continuation of a scene already progressing in her mind Mrs Henchard said You remember the note sent to you and Mr Farfraeasking you to meet some one in Durnover Barton and that you thought it was a trick to make fools of you
Yes
It was not to make fools of youit was done to bring you together
Twas I did it
Why
said Elizabeth with a start
Iwanted you to marry Mr
Farfrae
O mother
ElizabethJane bent down her head so much that she looked quite into her own lap
But as her mother did not go on she said What reason
Well I had a reason
Twill out one day
I wish it could have been in my time
But therenothing is as you wish it
Henchard hates him
Perhaps theyll be friends again murmured the girl
I dont knowI dont know
After this her mother was silent and dozed and she spoke on the subject no more
Some little time later on Farfrae was passing Henchards house on a Sunday morning when he observed that the blinds were all down
He rang the bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a small one and then he was informed that Mrs Henchard was deadjust deadthat very hour
At the townpump there were gathered when he passed a few old inhabitants who came there for water whenever they had as at present spare time to fetch it because it was purer from that original fount than from their own wells
Mrs Cuxsom who had been standing there for an indefinite time with her pitcher was describing the incidents of Mrs Henchards death as she had learnt them from the nurse
And she was white as marblestone said Mrs Cuxsom
And likewise such a thoughtful woman tooah poor soulthat a minded every little thing that wanted tending
Yes says she when Im gone and my last breaths blowed look in the top drawer o the chest in the back room by the window and youll find all my coffin clothes a piece of flannelthats to put under me and the little piece is to put under my head and my new stockings for my feetthey are folded alongside and all my other things
And theres four ounce pennies the heaviest I could find atied up in bits of linen for weightstwo for my right eye and two for my left she said
And when youve used em and my eyes dont open no more bury the pennies good souls and dont ye go spending em for I shouldnt like it
And open the windows as soon as I am carried out and make it as cheerful as you can for ElizabethJane
Ah poor heart
Well and Martha did it and buried the ounce pennies in the garden
But if yell believe words that man Christopher Coney went and dug em up and spent em at the Three Mariners
Faith he said why should death rob life o fourpence
Deaths not of such good report that we should respect en to that extent says he
Twas a cannibal deed
deprecated her listeners
Gad then I wont quite hae it said Solomon Longways
I say it today and tis a Sunday morning and I wouldnt speak wrongfully for a zilver zixpence at such a time
I dont see noo harm in it
To respect the dead is sound doxology and I wouldnt sell skellintonsleastwise respectable skellintonsto be varnished for natomies except I were out o work
But money is scarce and throats get dry
Why SHOULD death rob life o fourpence
I say there was no treason in it
Well poor soul shes helpless to hinder that or anything now answered Mother Cuxsom
And all her shining keys will be took from her and her cupboards opened and little things a didnt wish seen anybody will see and her wishes and ways will all be as nothing

Henchard and Elizabeth sat conversing by the fire
It was three weeks after Mrs Henchards funeral the candles were not lighted and a restless acrobatic flame poised on a coal called from the shady walls the smiles of all shapes that could respondthe old pierglass with gilt columns and huge entablature the pictureframes sundry knobs and handles and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband bellpull on either side of the chimneypiece
Elizabeth do you think much of old times
said Henchard
Yes sir often she said
Who do you put in your pictures of em
Mother and fathernobody else hardly
Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when ElizabethJane spoke of Richard Newson as father
Ah
I am out of all that am I not
he saidWas Newson a kind father
Yes sir very
Henchards face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which gradually modulated into something softer
Suppose I had been your real father
he said
Would you have cared for me as much as you cared for Richard Newson
I cant think it she said quickly
I can think of no other as my father except my father
Henchards wife was dissevered from him by death his friend and helper Farfrae by estrangement ElizabethJane by ignorance
It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled and that was the girl
His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone till he could no longer sit still
He walked up and down and then he came and stood behind her chair looking down upon the top of her head
He could no longer restrain his impulse
What did your mother tell you about memy history
he asked
That you were related by marriage
She should have told morebefore you knew me
Then my task would not have been such a hard oneElizabeth it is I who am your father and not Richard Newson
Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of em were alive
The back of Elizabeths head remained still and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing
Henchard went on Id rather have your scorn your fear anything than your ignorance tis that I hate
Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young
What you saw was our second marriage
Your mother was too honest
We had thought each other deadandNewson became her husband
This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth
As far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing but he showed a respect for the young girls sex and years worthy of a better man
When he had gone on to give details which a whole series of slight and unregarded incidents in her past life strangely corroborated when in short she believed his story to be true she became greatly agitated and turning round to the table flung her face upon it weeping
Dont crydont cry
said Henchard with vehement pathos I cant bear it I wont bear it
I am your father why should you cry
Am I so dreadful so hateful to ee
Dont take against me ElizabethJane
he cried grasping her wet hand
Dont take against methough I was a drinking man once and used your mother roughlyIll be kinder to you than HE was
Ill do anything if you will only look upon me as your father
She tried to stand up and comfort him trustfully but she could not she was troubled at his presence like the brethren at the avowal of Joseph
I dont want you to come to me all of a sudden said Henchard in jerks and moving like a great tree in a wind
No Elizabeth I dont
Ill go away and not see you till tomorrow or when you like and then Ill show ee papers to prove my words
There I am gone and wont disturb you any moreTwas I that chose your name my daughter your mother wanted it Susan
There dont forget twas I gave you your name
He went out at the door and shut her softly in and she heard him go away into the garden
But he had not done
Before she had moved or in any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure he reappeared
One word more Elizabeth he said
Youll take my surname nowhey
Your mother was against it but it will be much more pleasant to me
Tis legally yours you know
But nobody need know that
You shall take it as if by choice
Ill talk to my lawyerI dont know the law of it exactly but will you do thislet me put a few lines into the newspaper that such is to be your name
If it is my name I must have it mustnt I
she asked
Well well usage is everything in these matters
I wonder why mother didnt wish it
Oh some whim of the poor souls
Now get a bit of paper and draw up a paragraph as I shall tell you
But lets have a light
I can see by the firelight she answered
YesId rather
Very well
She got a piece of paper and bending over the fender wrote at his dictation words which he had evidently got by heart from some advertisement or otherwords to the effect that she the writer hitherto known as ElizabethJane Newson was going to call herself ElizabethJane Henchard forthwith
It was done and fastened up and directed to the office of the Casterbridge Chronicle
Now said Henchard with the blaze of satisfaction that he always emitted when he had carried his pointthough tenderness softened it this timeIll go upstairs and hunt for some documents that will prove it all to you
But I wont trouble you with them till tomorrow
Goodnight my ElizabethJane
He was gone before the bewildered girl could realize what it all meant or adjust her filial sense to the new center of gravity
She was thankful that he had left her to herself for the evening and sat down over the fire
Here she remained in silence and weptnot for her mother now but for the genial sailor Richard Newson to whom she seemed doing a wrong
Henchard in the meantime had gone upstairs
Papers of a domestic nature he kept in a drawer in his bedroom and this he unlocked
Before turning them over he leant back and indulged in reposeful thought
Elizabeth was his at last and she was a girl of such good sense and kind heart that she would be sure to like him
He was the kind of man to whom some human object for pouring out his heart uponwere it emotive or were it cholericwas almost a necessity
The craving for his heart for the reestablishment of this tenderest human tie had been great during his wifes lifetime and now he had submitted to its mastery without reluctance and without fear
He bent over the drawer again and proceeded in his search
Among the other papers had been placed the contents of his wifes little desk the keys of which had been handed to him at her request
Here was the letter addressed to him with the restriction NOT TO BE OPENED TILL ELIZABETHJANES WEDDINGDAY
Mrs Henchard though more patient than her husband had been no practical hand at anything
In sealing up the sheet which was folded and tucked in without an envelope in the oldfashioned way she had overlaid the junction with a large mass of wax without the requisite undertouch of the same
The seal had cracked and the letter was open
Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect
Some trifling fancy or other of poor Susans I suppose he said and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter MY DEAR MICHAELFor the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now
I hope you will understand why I think you will though perhaps you may not forgive me
But dear Michael I have done it for the best
I shall be in my grave when you read this and Elizabeth Jane will have a home
Dont curse me Mikethink of how I was situated
I can hardly write it but here it is
ElizabethJane is not your ElizabethJanethe child who was in my arms when you sold me
No she died three months after that and this living one is my other husbands
I christened her by the same name we had given to the first and she filled up the ache I felt at the others loss
Michael I am dying and I might have held my tongue but I could not
Tell her husband of this or not as you may judge and forgive if you can a woman you once deeply wronged as she forgives you
SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a windowpane through which he saw for miles
His lips twitched and he seemed to compress his frame as if to bear better
His usual habit was not to consider whether destiny were hard upon him or notthe shape of his ideals in cases of affliction being simply a moody I am to suffer I perceive
This much scourging then it is for me
But now through his passionate head there stormed this thought that the blasting disclosure was what he had deserved
His wifes extreme reluctance to have the girls name altered from Newson to Henchard was now accounted for fully
It furnished another illustration of that honesty in dishonesty which had characterized her in other things
He remained unnerved and purposeless for near a couple of hours till he suddenly said AhI wonder if it is true
He jumped up in an impulse kicked off his slippers and went with a candle to the door of ElizabethJanes room where he put his ear to the keyhole and listened
She was breathing profoundly
Henchard softly turned the handle entered and shading the light approached the bedside
Gradually bringing the light from behind a screening curtain he held it in such a manner that it fell slantwise on her face without shining on her eyes
He steadfastly regarded her features
They were fair his were dark
But this was an unimportant preliminary
In sleep there come to the surface buried genealogical facts ancestral curves dead mens traits which the mobility of daytime animation screens and overwhelms
In the present statuesque repose of the young girls countenance Richard Newsons was unmistakably reflected
He could not endure the sight of her and hastened away
Misery taught him nothing more than defiant endurance of it
His wife was dead and the first impulse for revenge died with the thought that she was beyond him
He looked out at the night as at a fiend
Henchard like all his kind was superstitious and he could not help thinking that the concatenation of events this evening had produced was the scheme of some sinister intelligence bent on punishing him
Yet they had developed naturally
If he had not revealed his past history to Elizabeth he would not have searched the drawer for papers and so on
The mockery was that he should have no sooner taught a girl to claim the shelter of his paternity than he discovered her to have no kinship with him
This ironical sequence of things angered him like an impish trick from a fellowcreature
Like Prester Johns his table had been spread and infernal harpies had snatched up the food
He went out of the house and moved sullenly onward down the pavement till he came to the bridge at the bottom of the High Street
Here he turned in upon a bypath on the river bank skirting the northeastern limits of the town
These precincts embodied the mournful phases of Casterbridge life as the south avenues embodied its cheerful moods
The whole way along here was sunless even in summer time in spring white frosts lingered here when other places were steaming with warmth while in winter it was the seedfield of all the aches rheumatisms and torturing cramps of the year
The Casterbridge doctors must have pined away for want of sufficient nourishment but for the configuration of the landscape on the northeastern side
The riverslow noiseless and darkthe Schwarzwasser of Casterbridgeran beneath a low cliff the two together forming a defence which had rendered walls and artificial earthworks on this side unnecessary
Here were ruins of a Franciscan priory and a mill attached to the same the water of which roared down a backhatch like the voice of desolation
Above the cliff and behind the river rose a pile of buildings and in the front of the pile a square mass cut into the sky
It was like a pedestal lacking its statue
This missing feature without which the design remained incomplete was in truth the corpse of a man for the square mass formed the base of the gallows the extensive buildings at the back being the county gaol
In the meadow where Henchard now walked the mob were wont to gather whenever an execution took place and there to the tune of the roaring weir they stood and watched the spectacle
The exaggeration which darkness imparted to the glooms of this region impressed Henchard more than he had expected
The lugubrious harmony of the spot with his domestic situation was too perfect for him impatient of effects scenes and adumbrations
It reduced his heartburning to melancholy and he exclaimed Why the deuce did I come here
He went on past the cottage in which the old local hangman had lived and died in times before that calling was monopolized over all England by a single gentleman and climbed up by a steep back lane into the town
For the sufferings of that night engendered by his bitter disappointment he might well have been pitied
He was like one who had half fainted and could neither recover nor complete the swoon
In words he could blame his wife but not in his heart and had he obeyed the wise directions outside her letter this pain would have been spared him for longpossibly for ever ElizabethJane seeming to show no ambition to quit her safe and secluded maiden courses for the speculative path of matrimony
The morning came after this night of unrest and with it the necessity for a plan
He was far too selfwilled to recede from a position especially as it would involve humiliation
His daughter he had asserted her to be and his daughter she should always think herself no matter what hyprocrisy it involved
But he was illprepared for the first step in this new situation
The moment he came into the breakfastroom Elizabeth advanced with open confidence to him and took him by the arm
I have thought and thought all night of it she said frankly
And I see that everything must be as you say
And I am going to look upon you as the father that you are and not to call you Mr Henchard any more
It is so plain to me now
Indeed father it is
For of course you would not have done half the things you have done for me and let me have my own way so entirely and bought me presents if I had only been your stepdaughter
HeMr Newsonwhom my poor mother married by such a strange mistake Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters here was very kindO so kind
she spoke with tears in her eyes but that is not the same thing as being ones real father after all
Now father breakfast is ready
she said cheerfully
Henchard bent and kissed her cheek
The moment and the act he had prefigured for weeks with a thrill of pleasure yet it was no less than a miserable insipidity to him now that it had come
His reinstation of her mother had been chiefly for the girls sake and the fruition of the whole scheme was such dust and ashes as this
20
Of all the enigmas which ever confronted a girl there can have been seldom one like that which followed Henchards announcement of himself to Elizabeth as her father
He had done it in an ardour and an agitation which had half carried the point of affection with her yet behold from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she had never seen it before
The coldness soon broke out into open chiding
One grievous failing of Elizabeths was her occasional pretty and picturesque use of dialect wordsthose terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel
It was dinnertimethey never met except at mealsand she happened to say when he was rising from table wishing to show him something If youll bide where you be a minute father Ill get it
Bide where you be he echoed sharply Good God are you only fit to carry wash to a pigtrough that ye use such words as those
She reddened with shame and sadness
I meant Stay where you are father she said in a low humble voice
I ought to have been more careful
He made no reply and went out of the room
The sharp reprimand was not lost upon her and in time it came to pass that for fay she said succeed that she no longer spoke of dumbledores but of humble bees no longer said of young men and women that they walked together but that they were engaged that she grew to talk of greggles as wild hyacinths that when she had not slept she did not quaintly tell the servants next morning that she had been hagrid but that she had suffered from indigestion
These improvements however are somewhat in advance of the story
Henchard being uncultivated himself was the bitterest critic the fair girl could possibly have had of her own lapsesreally slight now for she read omnivorously
A gratuitous ordeal was in store for her in the matter of her handwriting
She was passing the dining room door one evening and had occasion to go in for something
It was not till she had opened the door that she knew the Mayor was there in the company of a man with whom he transacted business
Here ElizabethJane he said looking round at her just write down what I tell youa few words of an agreement for me and this gentleman to sign
I am a poor tool with a pen
Be jowned and so be I said the gentleman
She brought forward blottingbook paper and ink and sat down
Now thenAn agreement entered into this sixteenth day of Octoberwrite that first
She started the pen in an elephantine march across the sheet
It was a splendid round bold hand of her own conception a style that would have stamped a woman as Minervas own in more recent days
But other ideas reigned then Henchards creed was that proper young girls wrote ladieshandnay he believed that bristling characters were as innate and inseparable a part of refined womanhood as sex itself
Hence when instead of scribbling like the Princess Ida In such a hand as when a field of corn Bows all its ears before the roaring East ElizabethJane produced a line of chainshot and sandbags he reddened in angry shame for her and peremptorily saying Never mindIll finish it dismissed her there and then
Her considerate disposition became a pitfall to her now
She was it must be admitted sometimes provokingly and unnecessarily willing to saddle herself with manual labours
She would go to the kitchen instead of ringing Not to make Phoebe come up twice
She went down on her knees shovel in hand when the cat overturned the coalscuttle moreover she would persistently thank the parlourmaid for everything till one day as soon as the girl was gone from the room Henchard broke out with Good God why dostnt leave off thanking that girl as if she were a goddessborn
Dont I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for ee
Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became sorry a few minutes after and said that he did not mean to be rough
These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which suggested rather than revealed what was underneath
But his passion had less terror for her than his coldness
The increasing frequency of the latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing dislike
The more interesting that her appearance and manners became under the softening influences which she could now command and in her wisdom did command the more she seemed to estrange him
Sometimes she caught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could hardly bear
Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname
But the most terrible ordeal was to come
Elizabeth had latterly been accustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and breadandcheese to Nance Mockridge who worked in the yard wimbling haybonds
Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first afterwards as a matter of course
On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the haybarn on this errand and as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf
Elizabeth come here
said Henchard and she obeyed
Why do you lower yourself so confoundedly
he said with suppressed passion
Havent I told you ot fifty times
Hey
Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers
Why yell disgrace me to the dust
Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character
Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences Come to that Mr Henchard I can let ee know sheve waited on worse
Then she must have had more charity than sense said Henchard
O no she hadnt
Twere not for charity but for hire and at a publichouse in this town
It is not true
cried Henchard indignantly
Just ask her said Nance folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows
Henchard glanced at ElizabethJane whose complexion now pink and white from confinement lost nearly all of the former colour
What does this mean
he said to her
Anything or nothing
It is true said ElizabethJane
But it was only Did you do it or didnt you
Where was it
At the Three Mariners one evening for a little while when we were staying there
Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard and sailed into the barn for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory
Henchard however said nothing about discharging her
Unduly sensitive on such points by reason of his own past he had the look of one completely ground down to the last indignity
Elizabeth followed him to the house like a culprit but when she got inside she could not see him
Nor did she see him again that day
Convinced of the scathing damage to his local repute and position that must have been caused by such a fact though it had never before reached his own ears Henchard showed a positive distaste for the presence of this girl not his own whenever he encountered her
He mostly dined with the farmers at the marketroom of one of the two chief hotels leaving her in utter solitude
Could he have seen how she made use of those silent hours he might have found reason to reserve his judgment on her quality
She read and took notes incessantly mastering facts with painful laboriousness but never flinching from her selfimposed task
She began the study of Latin incited by the Roman characteristics of the town she lived in
If I am not wellinformed it shall be by no fault of my own she would say to herself through the tears that would occasionally glide down her peachy cheeks when she was fairly baffled by the portentous obscurity of many of these educational works
Thus she lived on a dumb deepfeeling greateyed creature construed by not a single contiguous being quenching with patient fortitude her incipient interest in Farfrae because it seemed to be onesided unmaidenly and unwise
True that for reasons best known to herself she had since Farfraes dismissal shifted her quarters from the back room affording a view of the yard which she had occupied with such zest to a front chamber overlooking the street but as for the young man whenever he passed the house he seldom or never turned his head
Winter had almost come and unsettled weather made her still more dependent upon indoor resources
But there were certain early winter days in Casterbridgedays of firmamental exhaustion which followed angry southwesterly tempestswhen if the sun shone the air was like velvet
She seized on these days for her periodical visits to the spot where her mother lay buriedthe stillused burial ground of the old RomanBritish city whose curious feature was this its continuity as a place of sepulture
Mrs Henchards dust mingled with the dust of women who lay ornamented with glass hairpins and amber necklaces and men who held in their mouths coins of Hadrian Posthumus and the Constantines
Halfpast ten in the morning was about her hour for seeking this spota time when the town avenues were deserted as the avenues of Karnac
Business had long since passed down them into its daily cells and Leisure had not arrived there
So ElizabethJane walked and read or looked over the edge of the book to think and thus reached the churchyard
There approaching her mothers grave she saw a solitary dark figure in the middle of the gravelwalk
This figure too was reading but not from a book the words which engrossed it being the inscription on Mrs Henchards tombstone
The personage was in mourning like herself was about her age and size and might have been her wraith or double but for the fact that it was a lady much more beautifully dressed than she
Indeed comparatively indifferent as ElizabethJane was to dress unless for some temporary whim or purpose her eyes were arrested by the artistic perfection of the ladys appearance
Her gait too had a flexuousness about it which seemed to avoid angularity
It was a revelation to Elizabeth that human beings could reach this stage of external developmentshe had never suspected it
She felt all the freshness and grace to be stolen from herself on the instant by the neighbourhood of such a stranger
And this was in face of the fact that Elizabeth could now have been writ handsome while the young lady was simply pretty
Had she been envious she might have hated the woman but she did not do thatshe allowed herself the pleasure of feeling fascinated
She wondered where the lady had come from
The stumpy and practical walk of honest homeliness which mostly prevailed there the two styles of dress thereabout the simple and the mistaken equally avouched that this figure was no Casterbridge womans even if a book in her hand resembling a guidebook had not also suggested it
The stranger presently moved from the tombstone of Mrs Henchard and vanished behind the corner of the wall
Elizabeth went to the tomb herself beside it were two foot prints distinct in the soil signifying that the lady had stood there a long time
She returned homeward musing on what she had seen as she might have mused on a rainbow or the Northern Lights a rare butterfly or a cameo
Interesting as things had been out of doors at home it turned out to be one of her bad days
Henchard whose two years mayoralty was ending had been made aware that he was not to be chosen to fill a vacancy in the list of aldermen and that Farfrae was likely to become one of the Council
This caused the unfortunate discovery that she had played the waitingmaid in the town of which he was Mayor to rankle in his mind yet more poisonously
He had learnt by personal inquiry at the time that it was to Donald Farfraethat treacherous upstartthat she had thus humiliated herself
And though Mrs Stannidge seemed to attach no great importance to the incidentthe cheerful souls at the Three Mariners having exhausted its aspects long agosuch was Henchards haughty spirit that the simple thrifty deed was regarded as little less than a social catastrophe by him
Ever since the evening of his wifes arrival with her daughter there had been something in the air which had changed his luck
That dinner at the Kings Arms with his friends had been Henchards Austerlitz he had had his successes since but his course had not been upward
He was not to be numbered among the aldermenthat Peerage of burghersas he had expected to be and the consciousness of this soured him today
Well where have you been
he said to her with offhand laconism
Ive been strolling in the Walks and churchyard father till I feel quite leery
She clapped her hand to her mouth but too late
This was just enough to incense Henchard after the other crosses of the day
I WONT have you talk like that
he thundered
Leery indeed
One would think you worked upon a farm
One day I learn that you lend a hand in public houses
Then I hear you talk like a clodhopper
Im burned if it goes on this house cant hold us two
The only way of getting a single pleasant thought to go to sleep upon after this was by recalling the lady she had seen that day and hoping she might see her again
Meanwhile Henchard was sitting up thinking over his jealous folly in forbidding Farfrae to pay his addresses to this girl who did not belong to him when if he had allowed them to go on he might not have been encumbered with her
At last he said to himself with satisfaction as he jumped up and went to the writingtable Ah
hell think it means peace and a marriage portionnot that I dont want my house to be troubled with her and no portion at all
He wrote as follows SirOn consideration I dont wish to interfere with your courtship of ElizabethJane if you care for her
I therefore withdraw my objection excepting in thisthat the business be not carried on in my house Yours M HENCHARD Mr Farfrae
The morrow being fairly fine found ElizabethJane again in the churchyard but while looking for the lady she was startled by the apparition of Farfrae who passed outside the gate
He glanced up for a moment from a pocketbook in which he appeared to be making figures as he went whether or not he saw her he took no notice and disappeared
Unduly depressed by a sense of her own superfluity she thought he probably scorned her and quite broken in spirit sat down on a bench
She fell into painful thought on her position which ended with her saying quite loud O I wish I was dead with dear mother
Behind the bench was a little promenade under the wall where people sometimes walked instead of on the gravel
The bench seemed to be touched by something she looked round and a face was bending over her veiled but still distinct the face of the young woman she had seen yesterday
ElizabethJane looked confounded for a moment knowing she had been overheard though there was pleasure in her confusion
Yes I heard you said the lady in a vivacious voice answering her look
What can have happened
I dontI cant tell you said Elizabeth putting her hand to her face to hide a quick flush that had come
There was no movement or word for a few seconds then the girl felt that the young lady was sitting down beside her
I guess how it is with you said the latter
That was your mother
She waved her hand towards the tombstone
Elizabeth looked up at her as if inquiring of herself whether there should be confidence
The ladys manner was so desirous so anxious that the girl decided there should be confidence
It was my mother she said my only friend
But your father Mr Henchard
He is living
Yes he is living said ElizabethJane
Is he not kind to you
Ive no wish to complain of him
There has been a disagreement
A little
Perhaps you were to blame suggested the stranger
I wasin many ways sighed the meek Elizabeth
I swept up the coals when the servants ought to have done it and I said I was leeryand he was angry with me
The lady seemed to warm towards her for that reply
Do you know the impression your words give me
she said ingenuously
That he is a hottempered mana little proudperhaps ambitious but not a bad man
Her anxiety not to condemn Henchard while siding with Elizabeth was curious
O no certainly not BAD agreed the honest girl
And he has not even been unkind to me till latelysince mother died
But it has been very much to bear while it has lasted
All is owing to my defects I daresay and my defects are owing to my history
What is your history
ElizabethJane looked wistfully at her questioner
She found that her questioner was looking at her turned her eyes down and then seemed compelled to look back again
My history is not gay or attractive she said
And yet I can tell it if you really want to know
The lady assured her that she did want to know whereupon ElizabethJane told the tale of her life as she understood it which was in general the true one except that the sale at the fair had no part therein
Contrary to the girls expectation her new friend was not shocked
This cheered her and it was not till she thought of returning to that home in which she had been treated so roughly of late that her spirits fell
I dont know how to return she murmured
I think of going away
But what can I do
Where can I go
Perhaps it will be better soon said her friend gently
So I would not go far
Now what do you think of this I shall soon want somebody to live in my house partly as housekeeper partly as companion would you mind coming to me
But perhaps O yes cried Elizabeth with tears in her eyes
I would indeedI would do anything to be independent for then perhaps my father might get to love me
But ah
What
I am no accomplished person
And a companion to you must be that
O not necessarily
Not
But I cant help using rural words sometimes when I dont mean to
Never mind I shall like to know them
AndO I know I shant do
she cried with a distressful laugh
I accidentally learned to write round hand instead of ladieshand
And of course you want some one who can write that
Well no
What not necessary to write ladieshand
cried the joyous Elizabeth
Not at all
But where do you live
In Casterbridge or rather I shall be living here after twelve oclock today
Elizabeth expressed her astonishment
I have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready
The house I am going into is that one they call HighPlace Hallthe old stone one looking down the lane to the market
Two or three rooms are fit for occupation though not all I sleep there tonight for the first time
Now will you think over my proposal and meet me here the first fine day next week and say if you are still in the same mind
Elizabeth her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position joyfully assented and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard
21
As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it so did this HighPlace Hall now for the first time really show itself to ElizabethJane though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions
Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger and the house and her own chance of living there all the rest of the day
In the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets
HighPlace Hall was undergoing repair a lady was coming there to live shortly all the shoppeople knew it and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer
ElizabethJane could however add a capping touch to information so new to her in the bulk
The lady she said had arrived that day
When the lamps were lighted and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys attics and roofs invisible Elizabeth almost with a lovers feeling thought she would like to look at the outside of HighPlace Hall
She went up the street in that direction
The Hall with its grey facade and parapet was the only residence of its sort so near the centre of the town
It had in the first place the characteristics of a country mansionbirds nests in its chimneys damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from Natures trowel
At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls
This evening motes of straw lay around and other signs of the premises having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a new tenant
The house was entirely of stone and formed an example of dignity without great size
It was not altogether aristocratic still less consequential yet the oldfashioned stranger instinctively said Blood built it and Wealth enjoys it however vague his opinions of those accessories might be
Yet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong for until this very evening when the new lady had arrived the house had been empty for a year or two while before that interval its occupancy had been irregular
The reason of its unpopularity was soon made manifest
Some of its rooms overlooked the marketplace and such a prospect from such a house was not considered desirable or seemly by its wouldbe occupiers
Elizabeths eyes sought the upper rooms and saw lights there
The lady had obviously arrived
The impression that this woman of comparatively practised manner had made upon the studious girls mind was so deep that she enjoyed standing under an opposite archway merely to think that the charming lady was inside the confronting walls and to wonder what she was doing
Her admiration for the architecture of that front was entirely on account of the inmate it screened
Though for that matter the architecture deserved admiration or at least study on its own account
It was Palladian and like most architecture erected since the Gothic age was a compilation rather than a design
But its reasonableness made it impressive
It was not rich but rich enough
A timely consciousness of the ultimate vanity of human architecture no less than of other human things had prevented artistic superfluity
Men had still quite recently been going in and out with parcels and packingcases rendering the door and hall within like a public thoroughfare
Elizabeth trotted through the open door in the dusk but becoming alarmed at her own temerity she went quickly out again by another which stood open in the lofty wall of the back court
To her surprise she found herself in one of the littleused alleys of the town
Looking round at the door which had given her egress by the light of the solitary lamp fixed in the alley she saw that it was arched and oldolder even than the house itself
The door was studded and the keystone of the arch was a mask
Originally the mask had exhibited a comic leer as could still be discerned but generations of Casterbridge boys had thrown stones at the mask aiming at its open mouth and the blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had been eaten away by disease
The appearance was so ghastly by the weakly lampglimmer that she could not bear to look at itthe first unpleasant feature of her visit
The position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering mask suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the mansions past historyintrigue
By the alley it had been possible to come unseen from all sorts of quarters in the townthe old playhouse the old bull stake the old cockpit the pool wherein nameless infants had been used to disappear
HighPlace Hall could boast of its conveniences undoubtedly
She turned to come away in the nearest direction homeward which was down the alley but hearing footsteps approaching in that quarter and having no great wish to be found in such a place at such a time she quickly retreated
There being no other way out she stood behind a brick pier till the intruder should have gone his ways
Had she watched she would have been surprised
She would have seen that the pedestrian on coming up made straight for the arched doorway that as he paused with his hand upon the latch the lamplight fell upon the face of Henchard
But ElizabethJane clung so closely to her nook that she discerned nothing of this
Henchard passed in as ignorant of her presence as she was ignorant of his identity and disappeared in the darkness
Elizabeth came out a second time into the alley and made the best of her way home
Henchards chiding by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing anything definable as unladylike had operated thus curiously in keeping them unknown to each other at a critical moment
Much might have resulted from recognition at the least a query on either side in one and the self same form What could he or she possibly be doing there
Henchard whatever his business at the ladys house reached his own home only a few minutes later than ElizabethJane
Her plan was to broach the question of leaving his roof this evening the events of the day had urged her to the course
But its execution depended upon his mood and she anxiously awaited his manner towards her
She found that it had changed
He showed no further tendency to be angry he showed something worse
Absolute indifference had taken the place of irritability and his coldness was such that it encouraged her to departure even more than hot temper could have done
Father have you any objection to my going away
she asked
Going away
Nonone whatever
Where are you going
She thought it undesirable and unnecessary to say anything at present about her destination to one who took so little interest in her
He would know that soon enough
I have heard of an opportunity of getting more cultivated and finished and being less idle she answered with hesitation
A chance of a place in a household where I can have advantages of study and seeing refined life
Then make the best of it in Heavens nameif you cant get cultivated where you are
You dont object
ObjectI
Hono
Not at all
After a pause he said But you wont have enough money for this lively scheme without help you know
If you like I should be willing to make you an allowance so that you not be bound to live upon the starvation wages refined folk are likely to pay ee
She thanked him for this offer
It had better be done properly he added after a pause
A small annuity is what I should like you to haveso as to be independent of meand so that I may be independent of you
Would that please ye
Certainly
Then Ill see about it this very day
He seemed relieved to get her off his hands by this arrangement and as far as they were concerned the matter was settled
She now simply waited to see the lady again
The day and the hour came but a drizzling rain fell
ElizabethJane having now changed her orbit from one of gay independence to laborious selfhelp thought the weather good enough for such declined glory as hers if her friend would only face ita matter of doubt
She went to the bootroom where her pattens had hung ever since her apotheosis took them down had their mildewed leathers blacked and put them on as she had done in old times
Thus mounted and with cloak and umbrella she went off to the place of appointmentintending if the lady were not there to call at the house
One side of the churchyardthe side towards the weather was sheltered by an ancient thatched mud wall whose eaves overhung as much as one or two feet
At the back of the wall was a cornyard with its granary and barnsthe place wherein she had met Farfrae many months earlier
Under the projection of the thatch she saw a figure
The young lady had come
Her presence so exceptionally substantiated the girls utmost hopes that she almost feared her good fortune
Fancies find rooms in the strongest minds
Here in a churchyard old as civilization in the worst of weathers was a strange woman of curious fascinations never seen elsewhere there might be some devilry about her presence
However Elizabeth went on to the church tower on whose summit the rope of a flagstaff rattled in the wind and thus she came to the wall
The lady had such a cheerful aspect in the drizzle that Elizabeth forgot her fancy
Well said the lady a little of the whiteness of her teeth appearing with the word through the black fleece that protected her face have you decided
Yes quite said the other eagerly
Your father is willing
Yes
Then come along
When
Nowas soon as you like
I had a good mind to send to you to come to my house thinking you might not venture up here in the wind
But as I like getting out of doors I thought I would come and see first
It was my own thought
That shows we shall agree
Then can you come today
My house is so hollow and dismal that I want some living thing there
I think I might be able to said the girl reflecting
Voices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and raindrops from the other side of the wall
There came such words as sacks quarters threshing tailing next Saturdays market each sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked mirror
Both the women listened
Who are those
said the lady
One is my father
He rents that yard and barn
The lady seemed to forget the immediate business in listening to the technicalities of the corn trade
At last she said suddenly Did you tell him where you were going to
No
Ohow was that
I thought it safer to get away firstas he is so uncertain in his temper
Perhaps you are rightBesides I have never told you my name
It is Miss TemplemanAre they goneon the other side
No
They have only gone up into the granary
Well it is getting damp here
I shall expect you today this evening say at six
Which way shall I come maam
The front wayround by the gate
There is no other that I have noticed
ElizabethJane had been thinking of the door in the alley
Perhaps as you have not mentioned your destination you may as well keep silent upon it till you are clear off
Who knows but that he may alter his mind
ElizabethJane shook her head
On consideration I dont fear it she said sadly
He has grown quite cold to me
Very well
Six oclock then
When they had emerged upon the open road and parted they found enough to do in holding their bowed umbrellas to the wind
Nevertheless the lady looked in at the cornyard gates as she passed them and paused on one foot for a moment
But nothing was visible there save the ricks and the humpbacked barn cushioned with moss and the granary rising against the churchtower behind where the smacking of the rope against the flagstaff still went on
Now Henchard had not the slightest suspicion that Elizabeth Janes movement was to be so prompt
Hence when just before six he reached home and saw a fly at the door from the Kings Arms and his stepdaughter with all her little bags and boxes getting into it he was taken by surprise
But you said I might go father
she explained through the carriage window
Saidyes
But I thought you meant next month or next year
Od seize ityou take time by the forelock
This then is how you be going to treat me for all my trouble about ye
O father
how can you speak like that
It is unjust of you
she said with spirit
Well well have your own way he replied
He entered the house and seeing that all her things had not yet been brought down went up to her room to look on
He had never been there since she had occupied it
Evidences of her care of her endeavours for improvement were visible all around in the form of books sketches maps and little arrangements for tasteful effects
Henchard had known nothing of these efforts
He gazed at them turned suddenly about and came down to the door
Look here he said in an altered voicehe never called her by name nowdont ee go away from me
It may be Ive spoke roughly to youbut Ive been grieved beyond everything by youtheres something that caused it
By me
she said with deep concern
What have I done
I cant tell you now
But if youll stop and go on living as my daughter Ill tell you all in time
But the proposal had come ten minutes too late
She was in the flywas already in imagination at the house of the lady whose manner had such charms for her
Father she said as considerately as she could I think it best for us that I go on now
I need not stay long I shall not be far away and if you want me badly I can soon come back again
He nodded ever so slightly as a receipt of her decision and no more
You are not going far you say
What will be your address in case I wish to write to you
Or am I not to know
Oh yescertainly
It is only in the townHighPlace Hall
Where
said Henchard his face stilling
She repeated the words
He neither moved nor spoke and waving her hand to him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up the street
22
We go back for a moment to the preceding night to account for Henchards attitude
At the hour when ElizabethJane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucettas wellknown characters
The selfrepression the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance
HIGHPLACE HALL MY DEAR MR HENCHARDDont be surprised
It is for your good and mine as I hope that I have come to live at Casterbridgefor how long I cannot tell
That depends upon another and he is a man and a merchant and a Mayor and one who has the first right to my affections
Seriously mon ami I am not so lighthearted as I may seem to be from this
I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your wifewhom you used to think of as dead so many years before
Poor woman she seems to have been a sufferer though uncomplaining and though weak in intellect not an imbecile
I am glad you acted fairly by her
As soon as I knew she was no more it was brought home to me very forcibly by my conscience that I ought to endeavour to disperse the shade which my etourderie flung over my name by asking you to carry out your promise to me
I hope you are of the same mind and that you will take steps to this end
As however I did not know how you were situated or what had happened since our separation I decided to come and establish myself here before communicating with you
You probably feel as I do about this
I shall be able to see you in a day or two
Till then farewellYours LUCETTA 
PSI was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or two in passing through Casterbridge the other day
My plans were altered by a family event which it will surprise you to hear of
Henchard had already heard that HighPlace Hall was being prepared for a tenant
He said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered Who is coming to live at the Hall
A lady of the name of Templeman I believe sir said his informant
Henchard thought it over
Lucetta is related to her I suppose he said to himself
Yes I must put her in her proper position undoubtedly
It was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied the thought that he regarded the moral necessity now it was indeed with interest if not warmth
His bitter disappointment at finding ElizabethJane to be none of his and himself a childless man had left an emotional void in Henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill
In this frame of mind though without strong feeling he had strolled up the alley and into HighPlace Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him
He had gone on thence into the court and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there
Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he had known Lucettaor Lucette as she had called herself at that time
The man replied in the negative that Miss Templeman only had come
Henchard went away concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in
He was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed ElizabethJanes departure the next day
On hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as Templeman
Though he was not a fortune hunter the possibility that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which it might not otherwise have acquired
He was getting on towards the dead level of middle age when material things increasingly possess the mind
But Henchard was not left long in suspense
Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the fiasco in their marriage arrangements and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayors house from HighPlace Hall
I am in residence she said and comfortable though getting here has been a wearisome undertaking
You probably know what I am going to tell you or do you not
My good Aunt Templeman the bankers widow whose very existence you used to doubt much more her affluence has lately died and bequeathed some of her property to me
I will not enter into details except to say that I have taken her nameas a means of escape from mine and its wrongs
I am now my own mistress and have chosen to reside in Casterbridgeto be tenant of HighPlace Hall that at least you may be put to no trouble if you wish to see me
My first intention was to keep you in ignorance of the changes in my life till you should meet me in the street but I have thought better of this
You probably are aware of my arrangement with your daughter and have doubtless laughed at thewhat shall I call itpractical joke in all affection of my getting her to live with me
But my first meeting with her was purely an accident
Do you see Michael partly why I have done itwhy to give you an excuse for coming here as if to visit HER and thus to form my acquaintance naturally
She is a dear good girl and she thinks you have treated her with undue severity
You may have done so in your haste but not deliberately I am sure
As the result has been to bring her to me I am not disposed to upbraid youIn haste yours always LUCETTA
The excitement which these announcements produced in Henchards gloomy soul was to him most pleasurable
He sat over his diningtable long and dreamily and by an almost mechanical transfer the sentiments which had run to waste since his estrangement from ElizabethJane and Donald Farfrae gathered around Lucetta before they had grown dry
She was plainly in a very comingon disposition for marriage
But what else could a poor woman be who had given her time and her heart to him so thoughtlessly at that former time as to lose her credit by it
Probably conscience no less than affection had brought her here
On the whole he did not blame her
The artful little woman
he said smiling with reference to Lucettas adroit and pleasant manoeuvre with Elizabeth Jane
To feel that he would like to see Lucetta was with Henchard to start for her house
He put on his hat and went
It was between eight and nine oclock when he reached her door
The answer brought him was that Miss Templeman was engaged for that evening but that she would be happy to see him the next day
Thats rather like giving herself airs
he thought
And considering what we But after all she plainly had not expected him and he took the refusal quietly
Nevertheless he resolved not to go next day
These cursed women theres not an inch of straight grain in em
he said
Let us follow the train of Mr Henchards thought as if it were a clue line and view the interior of HighPlace Hall on this particular evening
On ElizabethJanes arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an elderly woman to go upstairs and take off her things
She replied with great earnestness that she would not think of giving that trouble and on the instant divested herself of her bonnet and cloak in the passage
She was then conducted to the first floor on the landing and left to find her way further alone
The room disclosed was prettily furnished as a boudoir or small drawingroom and on a sofa with two cylindrical pillows reclined a darkhaired largeeyed pretty woman of unmistakably French extraction on one side or the other
She was probably some years older than Elizabeth and had a sparkling light in her eye
In front of the sofa was a small table with a pack of cards scattered upon it faces upward
The attitude had been so full of abandonment that she bounded up like a spring on hearing the door open
Perceiving that it was Elizabeth she lapsed into ease and came across to her with a reckless skip that innate grace only prevented from being boisterous
Why you are late she said taking hold of Elizabeth Janes hands
There were so many little things to put up
And you seem deadalive and tired
Let me try to enliven you by some wonderful tricks I have learnt to kill time
Sit there and dont move
She gathered up the pack of cards pulled the table in front of her and began to deal them rapidly telling Elizabeth to choose some
Well have you chosen
she asked flinging down the last card
No stammered Elizabeth arousing herself from a reverie
I forgot I was thinking ofyou and meand how strange it is that I am here
Miss Templeman looked at ElizabethJane with interest and laid down the cards
Ah
never mind she said
Ill lie here while you sit by me and well talk
Elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa but with obvious pleasure
It could be seen that though in years she was younger than her entertainer in manner and general vision she seemed more of the sage
Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous position and throwing her arm above her browsomewhat in the pose of a wellknown conception of Titianstalked up at ElizabethJane invertedly across her forehead and arm
I must tell you something she said
I wonder if you have suspected it
I have only been mistress of a large house and fortune a little while
Ohonly a little while
murmured ElizabethJane her countenance slightly falling
As a girl I lived about in garrison towns and elsewhere with my father till I was quite flighty and unsettled
He was an officer in the army
I should not have mentioned this had I not thought it best you should know the truth
Yes yes
She looked thoughtfully round the roomat the little square piano with brass inlayings at the window curtains at the lamp at the fair and dark kings and queens on the cardtable and finally at the inverted face of Lucetta Templeman whose large lustrous eyes had such an odd effect upside down
Elizabeths mind ran on acquirements to an almost morbid degree
You speak French and Italian fluently no doubt she said
I have not been able to get beyond a wretched bit of Latin yet
Well for that matter in my native isle speaking French does not go for much
It is rather the other way
Where is your native isle
It was with rather more reluctance that Miss Templeman said Jersey
There they speak French on one side of the street and English on the other and a mixed tongue in the middle of the road
But it is a long time since I was there
Bath is where my people really belong to though my ancestors in Jersey were as good as anybody in England
They were the Le Sueurs an old family who have done great things in their time
I went back and lived there after my fathers death
But I dont value such past matters and am quite an English person in my feelings and tastes
Lucettas tongue had for a moment outrun her discretion
She had arrived at Casterbridge as a Bath lady and there were obvious reasons why Jersey should drop out of her life
But Elizabeth had tempted her to make free and a deliberately formed resolve had been broken
It could not however have been broken in safer company
Lucettas words went no further and after this day she was so much upon her guard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young Jersey woman who had been Henchards dear comrade at a critical time
Not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute avoidance of a French word if one by accident came to her tongue more readily than its English equivalent
She shirked it with the suddenness of the weak Apostle at the accusation Thy speech bewrayeth thee
Expectancy sat visibly upon Lucetta the next morning
She dressed herself for Mr Henchard and restlessly awaited his call before midday as he did not come she waited on through the afternoon
But she did not tell Elizabeth that the person expected was the girls stepfather
They sat in adjoining windows of the same room in Lucettas great stone mansion netting and looking out upon the market which formed an animated scene
Elizabeth could see the crown of her stepfathers hat among the rest beneath and was not aware that Lucetta watched the same object with yet intenser interest
He moved about amid the throng at this point lively as an anthill elsewhere more reposeful and broken up by stalls of fruit and vegetables
The farmers as a rule preferred the open carrefour for their transactions despite its inconvenient jostlings and the danger from crossing vehicles to the gloomy sheltered marketroom provided for them
Here they surged on this one day of the week forming a little world of leggings switches and samplebags men of extensive stomachs sloping like mountain sides men whose heads in walking swayed as the trees in November gales who in conversing varied their attitudes much lowering themselves by spreading their knees and thrusting their hands into the pockets of remote inner jackets
Their faces radiated tropical warmth for though when at home their countenances varied with the seasons their marketfaces all the year round were glowing little fires
All overclothes here were worn as if they were an inconvenience a hampering necessity
Some men were well dressed but the majority were careless in that respect appearing in suits which were historical records of their wearers deeds sunscorchings and daily struggles for many years past
Yet many carried ruffled chequebooks in their pockets which regulated at the bank hard by a balance of never less than four figures
In fact what these gibbous human shapes specially represented was ready moneymoney insistently readynot ready next year like a noblemans often not merely ready at the bank like a professional mans but ready in their large plump hands
It happened that today there rose in the midst of them all two or three tall appletrees standing as if they grew on the spot till it was perceived that they were held by men from the ciderdistricts who came here to sell them bringing the clay of their county on their boots
ElizabethJane who had often observed them said I wonder if the same trees come every week
What trees
said Lucetta absorbed in watching for Henchard
Elizabeth replied vaguely for an incident checked her
Behind one of the trees stood Farfrae briskly discussing a samplebag with a farmer
Henchard had come up accidentally encountering the young man whose face seemed to inquire Do we speak to each other
She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered No
ElizabethJane sighed
Are you particularly interested in anybody out there
said Lucetta
O no said her companion a quick red shooting over her face
Luckily Farfraes figure was immediately covered by the appletree
Lucetta looked hard at her
Quite sure
she said
O yes said ElizabethJane
Again Lucetta looked out
They are all farmers I suppose
she said
No
Theres Mr Bulgehes a wine merchant theres Benjamin Brownleta horse dealer and Kitson the pig breeder and Yopper the auctioneer besides maltsters and millersand so on
Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now but she did not mention him
The Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily
The market changed from the sampleshowing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards when tales were told
Henchard had not called on Lucetta though he had stood so near
He must have been too busy she thought
He would come on Sunday or Monday
The days came but not the visitor though Lucetta repeated her dressing with scrupulous care
She got disheartened
It may at once be declared that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance which had characterized her in their first acquaintance the then unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably
But there remained a conscientious wish to bring about her union with him now that there was nothing to hinder itto right her positionwhich in itself was a happiness to sigh for
With strong social reasons on her side why their marriage should take place there had ceased to be any worldly reason on his why it should be postponed since she had succeeded to fortune
Tuesday was the great Candlemas fair
At breakfast she said to ElizabethJane quite coolly I imagine your father may call to see you today
I suppose he stands close by in the marketplace with the rest of the corndealers
She shook her head
He wont come
Why
He has taken against me she said in a husky voice
You have quarreled more deeply than I know of
Elizabeth wishing to shield the man she believed to be her father from any charge of unnatural dislike said Yes
Then where you are is of all places the one he will avoid
Elizabeth nodded sadly
Lucetta looked blank twitched up her lovely eyebrows and lip and burst into hysterical sobs
Here was a disaster her ingenious scheme completely stultified
O my dear Miss Templemanwhats the matter
cried her companion
I like your company much
said Lucetta as soon as she could speak
Yes yesand so do I yours
Elizabeth chimed in soothingly
Butbut She could not finish the sentence which was naturally that if Henchard had such a rooted dislike for the girl as now seemed to be the case ElizabethJane would have to be got rid ofa disagreeable necessity
A provisional resource suggested itself
Miss Henchard will you go on an errand for me as soon as breakfast is overAh thats very good of you
Will you go and order  Here she enumerated several commissions at sundry shops which would occupy Elizabeths time for the next hour or two at least
And have you ever seen the Museum
ElizabethJane had not
Then you should do so at once
You can finish the morning by going there
It is an old house in a back streetI forget wherebut youll find outand there are crowds of interesting thingsskeletons teeth old pots and pans ancient boots and shoes birds eggsall charmingly instructive
Youll be sure to stay till you get quite hungry
Elizabeth hastily put on her things and departed
I wonder why she wants to get rid of me today
she said sorrowfully as she went
That her absence rather than her services or instruction was in request had been readily apparent to ElizabethJane simple as she seemed and difficult as it was to attribute a motive for the desire
She had not been gone ten minutes when one of Lucettas servants was sent to Henchards with a note
The contents were briefly DEAR MICHAELYou will be standing in view of my house to day for two or three hours in the course of your business so do please call and see me
I am sadly disappointed that you have not come before for can I help anxiety about my own equivocal relation to youespecially now my aunts fortune has brought me more prominently before society
Your daughters presence here may be the cause of your neglect and I have therefore sent her away for the morning
Say you come on businessI shall be quite alone
LUCETTA
When the messenger returned her mistress gave directions that if a gentleman called he was to be admitted at once and sat down to await results
Sentimentally she did not much care to see himhis delays had wearied her but it was necessary and with a sigh she arranged herself picturesquely in the chair first this way then that next so that the light fell over her head
Next she flung herself on the couch in the cymarecta curve which so became her and with her arm over her brow looked towards the door
This she decided was the best position after all and thus she remained till a mans step was heard on the stairs
Whereupon Lucetta forgetting her curve for Nature was too strong for Art as yet jumped up and ran and hid herself behind one of the windowcurtains in a freak of timidity
In spite of the waning of passion the situation was an agitating oneshe had not seen Henchard since his supposed temporary parting from her in Jersey
She could hear the servant showing the visitor into the room shutting the door upon him and leaving as if to go and look for her mistress
Lucetta flung back the curtain with a nervous greeting
The man before her was not Henchard
23
A conjecture that her visitor might be some other person had indeed flashed through Lucettas mind when she was on the point of bursting out but it was just too late to recede
He was years younger than the Mayor of Casterbridge fair fresh and slenderly handsome
He wore genteel cloth leggings with white buttons polished boots with infinite lace holes light cord breeches under a black velveteen coat and waistcoat and he had a silvertopped switch in his hand
Lucetta blushed and said with a curious mixture of pout and laugh on her faceO Ive made a mistake
The visitor on the contrary did not laugh half a wrinkle
But Im very sorry
he said in deprecating tones
I came and I inquired for Miss Henchard and they showed me up here and in no case would I have caught ye so unmannerly if I had known
I was the unmannerly one she said
But is it that I have come to the wrong house madam
said Mr Farfrae blinking a little in his bewilderment and nervously tapping his legging with his switch
O no sirsit down
You must come and sit down now you are here replied Lucetta kindly to relieve his embarrassment
Miss Henchard will be here directly
Now this was not strictly true but that something about the young manthat hyperborean crispness stringency and charm as of a wellbraced musical instrument which had awakened the interest of Henchard and of ElizabethJane and of the Three Mariners jovial crew at sight made his unexpected presence here attractive to Lucetta
He hesitated looked at the chair thought there was no danger in it though there was and sat down
Farfraes sudden entry was simply the result of Henchards permission to him to see Elizabeth if he were minded to woo her
At first he had taken no notice of Henchards brusque letter but an exceptionally fortunate business transaction put him on good terms with everybody and revealed to him that he could undeniably marry if he chose
Then who so pleasing thrifty and satisfactory in every way as ElizabethJane
Apart from her personal recommendations a reconciliation with his former friend Henchard would in the natural course of things flow from such a union
He therefore forgave the Mayor his curtness and this morning on his way to the fair he had called at her house where he learnt that she was staying at Miss Templemans
A little stimulated at not finding her ready and waitingso fanciful are menhe hastened on to HighPlace Hall to encounter no Elizabeth but its mistress herself
The fair today seems a large one she said when by natural deviation their eyes sought the busy scene without
Your numerous fairs and markets keep me interested
How many things I think of while I watch from here
He seemed in doubt how to answer and the babble without reached them as they satvoices as of wavelets on a looping sea one ever and anon rising above the rest
Do you look out often
he asked
Yesvery often
Do you look for any one you know
Why should she have answered as she did
I look as at a picture merely
But she went on turning pleasantly to him I may do so nowI may look for you
You are always there are you not
AhI dont mean it seriously
But it is amusing to look for somebody one knows in a crowd even if one does not want him
It takes off the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng and having no point of junction with it through a single individual
Ay
Maybe youll be very lonely maam
Nobody knows how lonely
But you are rich they say
If so I dont know how to enjoy my riches
I came to Casterbridge thinking I should like to live here
But I wonder if I shall
Where did ye come from maam
The neighbourhood of Bath
And I from near Edinboro he murmured
Its better to stay at home and thats true but a man must live where his money is made
It is a great pity but its always so
Yet Ive done very well this year
O yes he went on with ingenuous enthusiasm
You see that man with the drab kerseymere coat
I bought largely of him in the autumn when wheat was down and then afterwards when it rose a little I sold off all I had
It brought only a small profit to me while the farmers kept theirs expecting higher figures yes though the rats were gnawing the ricks hollow
Just when I sold the markets went lower and I bought up the corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first purchases
And then cried Farfrae impetuously his face alight I sold it a few weeks after when it happened to go up again
And so by contenting mysel with small profits frequently repeated I soon made five hundred poundsyes
bringing down his hand upon the table and quite forgetting where he waswhile the others by keeping theirs in hand made nothing at all
Lucetta regarded him with a critical interest
He was quite a new type of person to her
At last his eye fell upon the ladys and their glances met
Ay now Im wearying you
he exclaimed
She said No indeed colouring a shade
What then
Quite otherwise
You are most interesting
It was now Farfrae who showed the modest pink
I mean all you Scotchmen she added in hasty correction
So free from Southern extremes
We common people are all one way or the otherwarm or cold passionate or frigid
You have both temperatures going on in you at the same time
But how do you mean that
Ye were best to explain clearly maam
You are animatedthen you are thinking of getting on
You are sad the next momentthen you are thinking of Scotland and friends
Yes
I think of home sometimes
he said simply
So do Ias far as I can
But it was an old house where I was born and they pulled it down for improvements so I seem hardly to have any home to think of now
Lucetta did not add as she might have done that the house was in St Helier and not in Bath
But the mountains and the mists and the rocks they are there
And dont they seem like home
She shook her head
They do to methey do to me he murmured
And his mind could be seen flying away northwards
Whether its origin were national or personal it was quite true what Lucetta had said that the curious double strands in Farfraes thread of lifethe commercial and the romanticwere very distinct at times
Like the colours in a variegated cord those contrasts could be seen intertwisted yet not mingling
You are wishing you were back again she said
Ah no maam said Farfrae suddenly recalling himself
The fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud
It was the chief hiring fair of the year and differed quite from the market of a few days earlier
In substance it was a whiteybrown crowd flecked with whitethis being the body of labourers waiting for places
The long bonnets of the women like waggontilts their cotton gowns and checked shawls mixed with the carters smockfrocks for they too entered into the hiring
Among the rest at the corner of the pavement stood an old shepherd who attracted the eyes of Lucetta and Farfrae by his stillness
He was evidently a chastened man
The battle of life had been a sharp one with him for to begin with he was a man of small frame
He was now so bowed by hard work and years that approaching from behind a person could hardly see his head
He had planted the stem of his crook in the gutter and was resting upon the bow which was polished to silver brightness by the long friction of his hands
He had quite forgotten where he was and what he had come for his eyes being bent on the ground
A little way off negotiations were proceeding which had reference to him but he did not hear them and there seemed to be passing through his mind pleasant visions of the hiring successes of his prime when his skill laid open to him any farm for the asking
The negotiations were between a farmer from a distant county and the old mans son
In these there was a difficulty
The farmer would not take the crust without the crumb of the bargain in other words the old man without the younger and the son had a sweetheart on his present farm who stood by waiting the issue with pale lips
Im sorry to leave ye Nelly said the young man with emotion
But you see I cant starve father and hes out o work at Ladyday
Tis only thirtyfive mile
The girls lips quivered
Thirtyfive mile
she murmured
Ah
tis enough
I shall never see ee again
It was indeed a hopeless length of traction for Dan Cupids magnet for young men were young men at Casterbridge as elsewhere
O
no noI never shall she insisted when he pressed her hand and she turned her face to Lucettas wall to hide her weeping
The farmer said he would give the young man halfanhour for his answer and went away leaving the group sorrowing
Lucettas eyes full of tears met Farfraes
His too to her surprise were moist at the scene
It is very hard she said with strong feelings
Lovers ought not to be parted like that
O if I had my wish Id let people live and love at their pleasure
Maybe I can manage that theyll not be parted said Farfrae
I want a young carter and perhaps Ill take the old man tooyes hell not be very expensive and doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow
O you are so good
she cried delighted
Go and tell them and let me know if you have succeeded
Farfrae went out and she saw him speak to the group
The eyes of all brightened the bargain was soon struck
Farfrae returned to her immediately it was concluded
It is kindhearted of you indeed said Lucetta
For my part I have resolved that all my servants shall have lovers if they want them
Do make the same resolve
Farfrae looked more serious waving his head a half turn
I must be a little stricter than that he said
Why
You are aa thriving woman and I am a struggling hayand corn merchant
I am a very ambitious woman
Ah well I cannet explain
I dont know how to talk to ladies ambitious or no and thats true said Donald with grave regret
I try to be civil to a folkno more
I see you are as you say replied she sensibly getting the upper hand in these exchanges of sentiment
Under this revelation of insight Farfrae again looked out of the window into the thick of the fair
Two farmers met and shook hands and being quite near the window their remarks could be heard as others had been
Have you seen young Mr Farfrae this morning
asked one
He promised to meet me here at the stroke of twelve but Ive gone athwart and about the fair halfadozen times and never a sign of him though hes mostly a man to his word
I quite forgot the engagement murmured Farfrae
Now you must go said she must you not
Yes he replied
But he still remained
You had better go she urged
You will lose a customer
Now Miss Templeman you will make me angry exclaimed Farfrae
Then suppose you dont go but stay a little longer
He looked anxiously at the farmer who was seeking him and who just then ominously walked across to where Henchard was standing and he looked into the room and at her
I like staying but I fear I must go
he said
Business ought not to be neglected ought it
Not for a single minute
Its true
Ill come another timeif I may maam
Certainly she said
What has happened to us today is very curious
Something to think over when we are alone its like to be
Oh I dont know that
It is commonplace after all
No Ill not say that
O no
Well whatever it has been it is now over and the market calls you to be gone
Yes yes
Marketbusiness
I wish there were no business in the warrld
Lucetta almost laughedshe would quite have laughedbut that there was a little emotion going in her at the time
How you change
she said
You should not change like this
I have never wished such things before said the Scotchman with a simple shamed apologetic look for his weakness
It is only since coming here and seeing you
If thats the case you had better not look at me any longer
Dear me I feel I have quite demoralized you
But look or look not I will see you in my thoughts
Well Ill gothank you for the pleasure of this visit
Thank you for staying
Maybe Ill get into my marketmind when Ive been out a few minutes he murmured
But I dont knowI dont know
As he went she said eagerly You may hear them speak of me in Casterbridge as time goes on
If they tell you Im a coquette which some may because of the incidents of my life dont believe it for I am not
I swear I will not
he said fervidly
Thus the two
She had enkindled the young mans enthusiasm till he was quite brimming with sentiment while he from merely affording her a new form of idleness had gone on to wake her serious solicitude
Why was this
They could not have told
Lucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman
But her ups and downs capped by her indiscretions with Henchard had made her uncritical as to station
In her poverty she had met with repulse from the society to which she had belonged and she had no great zest for renewing an attempt upon it now
Her heart longed for some ark into which it could fly and be at rest
Rough or smooth she did not care so long as it was warm
Farfrae was shown out it having entirely escaped him that he had called to see Elizabeth
Lucetta at the window watched him threading the maze of farmers and farmers men
She could see by his gait that he was conscious of her eyes and her heart went out to him for his modestypleaded with her sense of his unfitness that he might be allowed to come again
He entered the markethouse and she could see him no more
Three minutes later when she had left the window knocks not of multitude but of strength sounded through the house and the waitingmaid tripped up
The Mayor she said
Lucetta had reclined herself and she was looking dreamily through her fingers
She did not answer at once and the maid repeated the information with the addition And hes afraid he hasnt much time to spare he says
Oh
Then tell him that as I have a headache I wont detain him today
The message was taken down and she heard the door close
Lucetta had come to Casterbridge to quicken Henchards feelings with regard to her
She had quickened them and now she was indifferent to the achievement
Her morning view of ElizabethJane as a disturbing element changed and she no longer felt strongly the necessity of getting rid of the girl for her stepfathers sake
When the young woman came in sweetly unconscious of the turn in the tide Lucetta went up to her and said quite sincerely Im so glad youve come
Youll live with me a long time wont you
Elizabeth as a watchdog to keep her father offwhat a new idea
Yet it was not unpleasing
Henchard had neglected her all these days after compromising her indescribably in the past
The least he could have done when he found himself free and herself affluent would have been to respond heartily and promptly to her invitation
Her emotions rose fell undulated filled her with wild surmise at their suddenness and so passed Lucettas experiences of that day
24
Poor ElizabethJane little thinking what her malignant star had done to blast the budding attentions she had won from Donald Farfrae was glad to hear Lucettas words about remaining
For in addition to Lucettas house being a home that raking view of the marketplace which it afforded had as much attraction for her as for Lucetta
The carrefour was like the regulation Open Place in spectacular dramas where the incidents that occur always happen to bear on the lives of the adjoining residents
Farmers merchants dairymen quacks hawkers appeared there from week to week and disappeared as the afternoon wasted away
It was the node of all orbits
From Saturday to Saturday was as from day to day with the two young women now
In an emotional sense they did not live at all during the intervals
Wherever they might go wandering on other days on marketday they were sure to be at home
Both stole sly glances out of the window at Farfraes shoulders and poll
His face they seldom saw for either through shyness or not to disturb his mercantile mood he avoided looking towards their quarters
Thus things went on till a certain marketmorning brought a new sensation
Elizabeth and Lucetta were sitting at breakfast when a parcel containing two dresses arrived for the latter from London
She called Elizabeth from her breakfast and entering her friends bedroom Elizabeth saw the gowns spread out on the bed one of a deep cherry colour the other lightera glove lying at the end of each sleeve a bonnet at the top of each neck and parasols across the gloves Lucetta standing beside the suggested human figure in an attitude of contemplation
I wouldnt think so hard about it said Elizabeth marking the intensity with which Lucetta was alternating the question whether this or that would suit best
But settling upon new clothes is so trying said Lucetta
You are that person pointing to one of the arrangements or you are THAT totally different person pointing to the other for the whole of the coming spring and one of the two you dont know which may turn out to be very objectionable
It was finally decided by Miss Templeman that she would be the cherrycoloured person at all hazards
The dress was pronounced to be a fit and Lucetta walked with it into the front room Elizabeth following her
The morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year
The sun fell so flat on the houses and pavement opposite Lucettas residence that they poured their brightness into her rooms
Suddenly after a rumbling of wheels there were added to this steady light a fantastic series of circling irradiations upon the ceiling and the companions turned to the window
Immediately opposite a vehicle of strange description had come to a standstill as if it had been placed there for exhibition
It was the newfashioned agricultural implement called a horsedrill till then unknown in its modern shape in this part of the country where the venerable seedlip was still used for sowing as in the days of the Heptarchy
Its arrival created about as much sensation in the cornmarket as a flying machine would create at Charing Cross
The farmers crowded round it women drew near it children crept under and into it
The machine was painted in bright hues of green yellow and red and it resembled as a whole a compound of hornet grasshopper and shrimp magnified enormously
Or it might have been likened to an upright musical instrument with the front gone
That was how it struck Lucetta
Why it is a sort of agricultural piano she said
It has something to do with corn said Elizabeth
I wonder who thought of introducing it here
Donald Farfrae was in the minds of both as the innovator for though not a farmer he was closely leagued with farming operations
And as if in response to their thought he came up at that moment looked at the machine walked round it and handled it as if he knew something about its make
The two watchers had inwardly started at his coming and Elizabeth left the window went to the back of the room and stood as if absorbed in the panelling of the wall
She hardly knew that she had done this till Lucetta animated by the conjunction of her new attire with the sight of Farfrae spoke out Let us go and look at the instrument whatever it is
ElizabethJanes bonnet and shawl were pitchforked on in a moment and they went out
Among all the agriculturists gathered round the only appropriate possessor of the new machine seemed to be Lucetta because she alone rivalled it in colour
They examined it curiously observing the rows of trumpet shaped tubes one within the other the little scoops like revolving saltspoons which tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted it to the ground till somebody said Good morning ElizabethJane
She looked up and there was her stepfather
His greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous and ElizabethJane embarrassed out of her equanimity stammered at random This is the lady I live with fatherMiss Templeman
Henchard put his hand to his hat which he brought down with a great wave till it met his body at the knee
Miss Templeman bowed
I am happy to become acquainted with you Mr Henchard she said
This is a curious machine
Yes Henchard replied and he proceeded to explain it and still more forcibly to ridicule it
Who brought it here
said Lucetta
Oh dont ask me maam
said Henchard
The thingwhy tis impossible it should act
Twas brought here by one of our machinists on the recommendation of a jumpedup jackanapes of a fellow who thinks His eye caught ElizabethJanes imploring face and he stopped probably thinking that the suit might be progressing
He turned to go away
Then something seemed to occur which his stepdaughter fancied must really be a hallucination of hers
A murmur apparently came from Henchards lips in which she detected the words You refused to see me
reproachfully addressed to Lucetta
She could not believe that they had been uttered by her stepfather unless indeed they might have been spoken to one of the yellow gaitered farmers near them
Yet Lucetta seemed silent and then all thought of the incident was dissipated by the humming of a song which sounded as though from the interior of the machine
Henchard had by this time vanished into the markethouse and both the women glanced towards the corn drill
They could see behind it the bent back of a man who was pushing his head into the internal works to master their simple secrets
The hummed song went on Tws on a smr afternn A wee bere the sn wnt dn When Kitty wi a braw nw gwn Cme owre the hlls to Gowrie
ElizabethJane had apprehended the singer in a moment and looked guilty of she did not know what
Lucetta next recognized him and more mistress of herself said archly The Lass of Gowrie from inside of a seeddrillwhat a phenomenon
Satisfied at last with his investigation the young man stood upright and met their eyes across the summit
We are looking at the wonderful new drill Miss Templeman said
But practically it is a stupid thingis it not
she added on the strength of Henchards information
Stupid
O no
said Farfrae gravely
It will revolutionize sowing heerabout
No more sowers flinging their seed about broadcast so that some falls by the wayside and some among thorns and all that
Each grain will go straight to its intended place and nowhere else whatever
Then the romance of the sower is gone for good observed ElizabethJane who felt herself at one with Farfrae in Biblereading at least
He that observeth the wind shall not sow so the Preacher said but his words will not be to the point any more
How things change
Ay ayIt must be so
Donald admitted his gaze fixing itself on a blank point far away
But the machines are already very common in the East and North of England he added apologetically
Lucetta seemed to be outside this train of sentiment her acquaintance with the Scriptures being somewhat limited
Is the machine yours
she asked of Farfrae
O no madam said he becoming embarrassed and deferential at the sound of her voice though with Elizabeth Jane he was quite at his ease
No noI merely recommended that it should be got
In the silence which followed Farfrae appeared only conscious of her to have passed from perception of Elizabeth into a brighter sphere of existence than she appertained to
Lucetta discerning that he was much mixed that day partly in his mercantile mood and partly in his romantic one said gaily to him Well dont forsake the machine for us and went indoors with her companion
The latter felt that she had been in the way though why was unaccountable to her
Lucetta explained the matter somewhat by saying when they were again in the sittingroom I had occasion to speak to Mr Farfrae the other day and so I knew him this morning
Lucetta was very kind towards Elizabeth that day
Together they saw the market thicken and in course of time thin away with the slow decline of the sun towards the upper end of town its rays taking the street endways and enfilading the long thoroughfare from top to bottom
The gigs and vans disappeared one by one till there was not a vehicle in the street
The time of the riding world was over the pedestrian world held sway
Field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the villages for their weekly shopping and instead of a rattle of wheels and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier there was nothing but the shuffle of many feet
All the implements were gone all the farmers all the moneyed class
The character of the towns trading had changed from bulk to multiplicity and pence were handled now as pounds had been handled earlier in the day
Lucetta and Elizabeth looked out upon this for though it was night and the street lamps were lighted they had kept their shutters unclosed
In the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely
Your father was distant with you said Lucetta
Yes
And having forgotten the momentary mystery of Henchards seeming speech to Lucetta she continued It is because he does not think I am respectable
I have tried to be so more than you can imagine but in vain
My mothers separation from my father was unfortunate for me
You dont know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life
Lucetta seemed to wince
I do notof that kind precisely she said but you may feel asense of disgraceshamein other ways
Have you ever had any such feeling
said the younger innocently
O no said Lucetta quickly
I was thinking ofwhat happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own
It must make them very unhappy afterwards
It makes them anxious for might not other women despise them
Not altogether despise them
Yet not quite like or respect them
Lucetta winced again
Her past was by no means secure from investigation even in Casterbridge
For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement
Possibly they were destroyed but she could have wished that they had never been written
The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion
A few days afterwards when her eyes met Lucettas as the latter was going out she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman
The fact was printed large all over Lucettas cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as ElizabethJane was beginning to do
Lucetta passed on and closed the street door
A seers spirit took possession of Elizabeth impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed
She followed Lucetta thus mentallysaw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chancesaw him wear his special look when meeting women with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta
She depicted his impassioned manner beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed depicted their shaking of hands how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion thus invisible to all but themselves
This discerning silent witch had not done thinking of these things when Lucetta came noiselessly behind her and made her start
It was all true as she had picturedshe could have sworn it
Lucetta had a heightened luminousness in her eye over and above the advanced colour of her cheeks
Youve seen Mr Farfrae said Elizabeth demurely
Yes said Lucetta
How did you know
She knelt down on the hearth and took her friends hands excitedly in her own
But after all she did not say when or how she had seen him or what he had said
That night she became restless in the morning she was feverish and at breakfasttime she told her companion that she had something on her mindsomething which concerned a person in whom she was interested much
Elizabeth was earnest to listen and sympathize
This persona ladyonce admired a man muchvery much she said tentatively
Ah said ElizabethJane
They were intimaterather
He did not think so deeply of her as she did of him
But in an impulsive moment purely out of reparation he proposed to make her his wife
She agreed
But there was an unsuspected hitch in the proceedings though she had been so far compromised with him that she felt she could never belong to another man as a pure matter of conscience even if she should wish to
After that they were much apart heard nothing of each other for a long time and she felt her life quite closed up for her
Ahpoor girl
She suffered much on account of him though I should add that he could not altogether be blamed for what had happened
At last the obstacle which separated them was providentially removed and he came to marry her
How delightful
But in the interval shemy poor friendhad seen a man she liked better than him
Now comes the point Could she in honour dismiss the first
A new man she liked betterthats bad
Yes said Lucetta looking pained at a boy who was swinging the town pumphandle
It is bad
Though you must remember that she was forced into an equivocal position with the first man by an accidentthat he was not so well educated or refined as the second and that she had discovered some qualities in the first that rendered him less desirable as a husband than she had at first thought him to be
I cannot answer said ElizabethJane thoughtfully
It is so difficult
It wants a Pope to settle that
You prefer not to perhaps
Lucetta showed in her appealing tone how much she leant on Elizabeths judgment
Yes Miss Templeman admitted Elizabeth
I would rather not say
Nevertheless Lucetta seemed relieved by the simple fact of having opened out the situation a little and was slowly convalescent of her headache
Bring me a lookingglass
How do I appear to people
she said languidly
Wella little worn answered Elizabeth eyeing her as a critic eyes a doubtful painting fetching the glass she enabled Lucetta to survey herself in it which Lucetta anxiously did
I wonder if I wear well as times go
she observed after a while
Yesfairly
Where am I worst
Under your eyesI notice a little brownness there
Yes
That is my worst place I know
How many years more do you think I shall last before I get hopelessly plain
There was something curious in the way in which Elizabeth though the younger had come to play the part of experienced sage in these discussions
It may be five years she said judicially
Or with a quiet life as many as ten
With no love you might calculate on ten
Lucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable impartial verdict
She told ElizabethJane no more of the past attachment she had roughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person and Elizabeth who in spite of her philosophy was very tenderhearted sighed that night in bed at the thought that her pretty rich Lucetta did not treat her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions
For by the she of Lucettas story Elizabeth had not been beguiled
25
The next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucettas heart was an experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent trepidation
Conventionally speaking he conversed with both Miss Templeman and her companion but in fact it was rather that Elizabeth sat invisible in the room
Donald appeared not to see her at all and answered her wise little remarks with curtly indifferent monosyllables his looks and faculties hanging on the woman who could boast of a more Protean variety in her phases moods opinions and also principles than could Elizabeth
Lucetta had persisted in dragging her into the circle but she had remained like an awkward third point which that circle would not touch
Susan Henchards daughter bore up against the frosty ache of the treatment as she had borne up under worse things and contrived as soon as possible to get out of the inharmonious room without being missed
The Scotchman seemed hardly the same Farfrae who had danced with her and walked with her in a delicate poise between love and friendshipthat period in the history of a love when alone it can be said to be unalloyed with pain
She stoically looked from her bedroom window and contemplated her fate as if it were written on the top of the churchtower hard by
Yes she said at last bringing down her palm upon the sill with a pat HE is the second man of that story she told me
All this time Henchards smouldering sentiments towards Lucetta had been fanned into higher and higher inflammation by the circumstances of the case
He was discovering that the young woman for whom he once felt a pitying warmth which had been almost chilled out of him by reflection was when now qualified with a slight inaccessibility and a more matured beauty the very being to make him satisfied with life
Day after day proved to him by her silence that it was no use to think of bringing her round by holding aloof so he gave in and called upon her again ElizabethJane being absent
He crossed the room to her with a heavy tread of some awkwardness his strong warm gaze upon herlike the sun beside the moon in comparison with Farfraes modest look and with something of a hailfellow bearing as indeed was not unnatural
But she seemed so transubstantiated by her change of position and held out her hand to him in such cool friendship that he became deferential and sat down with a perceptible loss of power
He understood but little of fashion in dress yet enough to feel himself inadequate in appearance beside her whom he had hitherto been dreaming of as almost his property
She said something very polite about his being good enough to call
This caused him to recover balance
He looked her oddly in the face losing his awe
Why of course I have called Lucetta he said
What does that nonsense mean
You know I couldnt have helped myself if I had wishedthat is if I had any kindness at all
Ive called to say that I am ready as soon as custom will permit to give you my name in return for your devotion and what you lost by it in thinking too little of yourself and too much of me to say that you can fix the day or month with my full consent whenever in your opinion it would be seemly you know more of these things than I
It is full early yet she said evasively
Yes yes I suppose it is
But you know Lucetta I felt directly my poor illused Susan died and when I could not bear the idea of marrying again that after what had happened between us it was my duty not to let any unnecessary delay occur before putting things to rights
Still I wouldnt call in a hurry becausewell you can guess how this money youve come into made me feel
His voice slowly fell he was conscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable in the street
He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself
Upon my life I didnt know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge he said
Nor can it be  said she
Nor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town
It took a waggon and four horses to get it here
Hm
It looks as if you were living on capital
O no I am not
So much the better
But the fact is your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward
Why
An answer was not really needed and he did not furnish one
Well he went on theres nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you Lucetta and nobody I am sure who will become it more
He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat notwithstanding that she knew him so well
I am greatly obliged to you for all that said she rather with an air of speaking ritual
The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived and Henchard showed chagrin at once nobody was more quick to show that than he
You may be obliged or not fort
Though the things I say may not have the polish of what youve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life they are real my lady Lucetta
Thats rather a rude way of speaking to me pouted Lucetta with stormy eyes
Not at all
replied Henchard hotly
But there there I dont wish to quarrel with ee
I come with an honest proposal for silencing your Jersey enemies and you ought to be thankful
How can you speak so
she answered firing quickly
Knowing that my only crime was the indulging in a foolish girls passion for you with too little regard for correctness and that I was what I call innocent all the time they called me guilty you ought not to be so cutting
I suffered enough at that worrying time when you wrote to tell me of your wifes return and my consequent dismissal and if I am a little independent now surely the privilege is due to me
Yes it is he said
But it is not by what is in this life but by what appears that you are judged and I therefore think you ought to accept mefor your own good names sake
What is known in your native Jersey may get known here
How you keep on about Jersey
I am English
Yes yes
Well what do you say to my proposal
For the first time in their acquaintance Lucetta had the move and yet she was backward
For the present let things be she said with some embarrassment
Treat me as an acquaintance and Ill treat you as one
Time will She stopped and he said nothing to fill the gap for awhile there being no pressure of half acquaintance to drive them into speech if they were not minded for it
Thats the way the wind blows is it
he said at last grimly nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts
A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants
It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country in a waggon marked with Farfraes name
Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horse back
Lucettas face becameas a womans face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition
A turn of the eye by Henchard a glance from the window and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed
But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumbstraight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucettas face
I shouldnt have thought itI shouldnt have thought it of women
he said emphatically byandby rising and shaking himself into activity while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry
Bringing him some apples she insisted upon paring one for him
He would not take it
No no such is not for me he said drily and moved to the door
At going out he turned his eye upon her
You came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account he said
Yet now you are here you wont have anything to say to my offer
He had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa and jumped up again in a fit of desperation
I WILL love him
she cried passionately as for HIM hes hottempered and stern and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that
I wont be a slave to the past Ill love where I choose
Yet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed her capable of aiming higher than Farfrae
But Lucetta reasoned nothing she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier associated she had no relatives left and with native lightness of heart took kindly to what fate offered
ElizabethJane surveying the position of Lucetta between her two lovers from the crystalline sphere of a straightforward mind did not fail to perceive that her father as she called him and Donald Farfrae became more desperately enamoured of her friend every day
On Farfraes side it was the unforced passion of youth
On Henchards the artificially stimulated coveting of maturer age
The pain she experienced from the almost absolute obliviousness to her existence that was shown by the pair of them became at times half dissipated by her sense of its humourousness
When Lucetta had pricked her finger they were as deeply concerned as if she were dying when she herself had been seriously sick or in danger they uttered a conventional word of sympathy at the news and forgot all about it immediately
But as regarded Henchard this perception of hers also caused her some filial grief she could not help asking what she had done to be neglected so after the professions of solicitude he had made
As regarded Farfrae she thought after honest reflection that it was quite natural
What was she beside Lucettaas one of the meaner beauties of the night when the moon had risen in the skies
She had learnt the lesson of renunciation and was as familiar with the wreck of each days wishes as with the diurnal setting of the sun
If her earthly career had taught her few book philosophies it had at least well practised her in this
Yet her experience had consisted less in a series of pure disappointments than in a series of substitutions
Continually it had happened that what she had desired had not been granted her and that what had been granted her she had not desired
So she viewed with an approach to equanimity the new cancelled days when Donald had been her undeclared lover and wondered what unwished for thing Heaven might send her in place of him
26
It chanced that on a fine spring morning Henchard and Farfrae met in the chestnutwalk which ran along the south wall of the town
Each had just come out from his early breakfast and there was not another soul near
Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta sent in answer to a note from him in which she made some excuse for not immediately granting him a second interview that he had desired
Donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on their present constrained terms neither would he pass him in scowling silence
He nodded and Henchard did the same
They receded from each other several paces when a voice cried Farfrae
It was Henchards who stood regarding him
Do you remember said Henchard as if it were the presence of the thought and not of the man which made him speak do you remember my story of that second womanwho suffered for her thoughtless intimacy with me
I do said Farfrae
Do you remember my telling ee how it all began and how it ended
Yes
Well I have offered to marry her now that I can but she wont marry me
Now what would you think of herI put it to you
Well ye owe her nothing more now said Farfrae heartily
It is true said Henchard and went on
That he had looked up from a letter to ask his questions completely shut out from Farfraes mind all vision of Lucetta as the culprit
Indeed her present position was so different from that of the young woman of Henchards story as of itself to be sufficient to blind him absolutely to her identity
As for Henchard he was reassured by Farfraes words and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his mind
They were not those of a conscious rival
Yet that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded
He could feel it in the air around Lucetta see it in the turn of her pen
There was an antagonistic force in exercise so that when he had tried to hang near her he seemed standing in a refluent current
That it was not innate caprice he was more and more certain
Her windows gleamed as if they did not want him her curtains seem to hang slily as if they screened an ousting presence
To discover whose presence that waswhether really Farfraes after all or anothershe exerted himself to the utmost to see her again and at length succeeded
At the interview when she offered him tea he made it a point to launch a cautious inquiry if she knew Mr Farfrae
O yes she knew him she declared she could not help knowing almost everybody in Casterbridge living in such a gazebo over the centre and arena of the town
Pleasant young fellow said Henchard
Yes said Lucetta
We both know him said kind ElizabethJane to relieve her companions divined embarrassment
There was a knock at the door literally three full knocks and a little one at the end
That kind of knock means halfandhalfsomebody between gentle and simple said the cornmerchant to himself
I shouldnt wonder therefore if it is he
In a few seconds surely enough Donald walked in
Lucetta was full of little fidgets and flutters which increased Henchards suspicions without affording any special proof of their correctness
He was wellnigh ferocious at the sense of the queer situation in which he stood towards this woman
One who had reproached him for deserting her when calumniated who had urged claims upon his consideration on that account who had lived waiting for him who at the first decent opportunity had come to ask him to rectify by making her his the false position into which she had placed herself for his sake such she had been
And now he sat at her teatable eager to gain her attention and in his amatory rage feeling the other man present to be a villain just as any young fool of a lover might feel
They sat stiffly side by side at the darkening table like some Tuscan painting of the two disciples supping at Emmaus
Lucetta forming the third and haloed figure was opposite them ElizabethJane being out of the game and out of the group could observe all from afar like the evangelist who had to write it down that there were long spaces of taciturnity when all exterior circumstances were subdued to the touch of spoons and china the click of a heel on the pavement under the window the passing of a wheelbarrow or cart the whistling of the carter the gush of water into householders buckets at the townpump opposite the exchange of greetings among their neighbours and the rattle of the yokes by which they carried off their evening supply
More breadandbutter
said Lucetta to Henchard and Farfrae equally holding out between them a plateful of long slices
Henchard took a slice by one end and Donald by the other each feeling certain he was the man meant neither let go and the slice came in two
OhI am so sorry
cried Lucetta with a nervous titter
Farfrae tried to laugh but he was too much in love to see the incident in any but a tragic light
How ridiculous of all three of them
said Elizabeth to herself
Henchard left the house with a ton of conjecture though without a grain of proof that the counterattraction was Farfrae and therefore he would not make up his mind
Yet to ElizabethJane it was plain as the townpump that Donald and Lucetta were incipient lovers
More than once in spite of her care Lucetta had been unable to restrain her glance from flitting across into Farfraes eyes like a bird to its nest
But Henchard was constructed upon too large a scale to discern such minutiae as these by an evening light which to him were as the notes of an insect that lie above the compass of the human ear
But he was disturbed
And the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was so much superadded to the palpable rivalry of their business lives
To the coarse materiality of that rivalry it added an inflaming soul
The thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by Henchard sending for Jopp the manager originally displaced by Farfraes arrival
Henchard had frequently met this man about the streets observed that his clothing spoke of neediness heard that he lived in Mixen Lanea back slum of the town the pis aller of Casterbridge domiciliation itself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when he would not stick at trifles
Jopp came after dark by the gates of the storeyard and felt his way through the hay and straw to the office where Henchard sat in solitude awaiting him
I am again out of a foreman said the cornfactor
Are you in a place
Not so much as a beggars sir
How much do you ask
Jopp named his price which was very moderate
When can you come
At this hour and moment sir said Jopp who standing handspocketed at the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat to scarecrow green had regularly watched Henchard in the marketplace measured him and learnt him by virtue of the power which the still man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows himself
Jopp too had had a convenient experience he was the only one in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the closelipped Elizabeth who knew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey and but proximately from Bath
I know Jersey too sir he said
Was living there when you used to do business that way
O yeshave often seen ye there
Indeed
Very good
Then the thing is settled
The testimonials you showed me when you first tried fort are sufficient
That characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to Henchard
Jopp said Thank you and stood more firmly in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot
Now said Henchard digging his strong eyes into Jopps face one thing is necessary to me as the biggest corn andhay dealer in these parts
The Scotchman whos taking the town trade so bold into his hands must be cut out
Dye hear
We two cant live side by sidethats clear and certain
Ive seen it all said Jopp
By fair competition I mean of course Henchard continued
But as hard keen and unflinching as fairrather more so
By such a desperate bid against him for the farmers custom as will grind him into the groundstarve him out
Ive capital mind ye and I can do it
Im all that way of thinking said the new foreman
Jopps dislike of Farfrae as the man who had once ursurped his place while it made him a willing tool made him at the same time commercially as unsafe a colleague as Henchard could have chosen
I sometimes think he added that he must have some glass that he sees next year in
He has such a knack of making everything bring him fortune
Hes deep beyond all honest mens discerning but we must make him shallower
Well undersell him and overbuy him and so snuff him out
They then entered into specific details of the process by which this would be accomplished and parted at a late hour
ElizabethJane heard by accident that Jopp had been engaged by her stepfather
She was so fully convinced that he was not the right man for the place that at the risk of making Henchard angry she expressed her apprehension to him when they met
But it was done to no purpose
Henchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff
The seasons weather seemed to favour their scheme
The time was in the years immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized the trade in grain when still as from the earliest ages the wheat quotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest
A bad harvest or the prospect of one would double the price of corn in a few weeks and the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly
Prices were like the roads of the period steep in gradient reflecting in their phases the local conditions without engineering levellings or averages
The farmers income was ruled by the wheatcrop within his own horizon and the wheatcrop by the weather
Thus in person he became a sort of fleshbarometer with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around him
The local atmosphere was everything to him the atmospheres of other countries a matter of indifference
The people too who were not farmers the rural multitude saw in the god of the weather a more important personage than they do now
Indeed the feeling of the peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in these equable days
Their impulse was wellnigh to prostrate themselves in lamentation before untimely rains and tempests which came as the Alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor
After midsummer they watched the weathercocks as men waiting in antechambers watch the lackey
Sun elated them quiet rain sobered them weeks of watery tempest stupefied them
That aspect of the sky which they now regard as disagreeable they then beheld as maleficent
It was June and the weather was very unfavourable
Casterbridge being as it were the bellboard on which all the adjacent hamlets and villages sounded their notes was decidedly dull
Instead of new articles in the shopwindows those that had been rejected in the foregoing summer were brought out again superseded reaphooks badlyshaped rakes shopworn leggings and timestiffened watertights reappeared furbished up as near to new as possible
Henchard backed by Jopp read a disastrous garnering and resolved to base his strategy against Farfrae upon that reading
But before acting he wishedwhat so many have wishedthat he could know for certain what was at present only strong probability
He was superstitiousas such headstrong natures often areand he nourished in his mind an idea bearing on the matter an idea he shrank from disclosing even to Jopp
In a lonely hamlet a few miles from the townso lonely that what are called lonely villages were teeming by comparison there lived a man of curious repute as a forecaster or weatherprophet
The way to his house was crooked and miry even difficult in the present unpropitious season
One evening when it was raining so heavily that ivy and laurel resounded like distant musketry and an outdoor man could be excused for shrouding himself to his ears and eyes such a shrouded figure on foot might have been perceived travelling in the direction of the hazelcopse which dripped over the prophets cot
The turnpikeroad became a lane the lane a carttrack the carttrack a bridlepath the bridlepath a footway the footway overgrown
The solitary walker slipped here and there and stumbled over the natural springes formed by the brambles till at length he reached the house which with its garden was surrounded with a high dense hedge
The cottage comparatively a large one had been built of mud by the occupiers own hands and thatched also by himself
Here he had always lived and here it was assumed he would die
He existed on unseen supplies for it was an anomalous thing that while there was hardly a soul in the neighbourhood but affected to laugh at this mans assertions uttering the formula Theres nothing in em with full assurance on the surface of their faces very few of them were unbelievers in their secret hearts
Whenever they consulted him they did it for a fancy
When they paid him they said Just a trifle for Christmas or Candlemas as the case might be
He would have preferred more honesty in his clients and less sham ridicule but fundamental belief consoled him for superficial irony
As stated he was enabled to live people supported him with their backs turned
He was sometimes astonished that men could profess so little and believe so much at his house when at church they professed so much and believed so little
Behind his back he was called Wideoh on account of his reputation to his face Mr Fall
The hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance and a door was inserted as in a wall
Outside the door the tall traveller stopped bandaged his face with a handkerchief as if he were suffering from toothache and went up the path
The window shutters were not closed and he could see the prophet within preparing his supper
In answer to the knock Fall came to the door candle in hand
The visitor stepped back a little from the light and said Can I speak to ee
in significant tones
The others invitation to come in was responded to by the country formula This will do thank ee after which the householder had no alternative but to come out
He placed the candle on the corner of the dresser took his hat from a nail and joined the stranger in the porch shutting the door behind him
Ive long heard that you cando things of a sort
began the other repressing his individuality as much as he could
Maybe so Mr Henchard said the weathercaster
Ahwhy do you call me that
asked the visitor with a start
Because its your name
Feeling youd come Ive waited for ee and thinking you might be leery from your walk I laid two supper plateslook ye here
He threw open the door and disclosed the suppertable at which appeared a second chair knife and fork plate and mug as he had declared
Henchard felt like Saul at his reception by Samuel he remained in silence for a few moments then throwing off the disguise of frigidity which he had hitherto preserved he said Then I have not come in vainNow for instance can ye charm away warts
Without trouble
Cure the evil
That Ive donewith considerationif they will wear the toadbag by night as well as by day
Forecast the weather
With labour and time
Then take this said Henchard
Tis a crownpiece
Now what is the harvest fortnight to be
When can I know
Ive worked it out already and you can know at once
The fact was that five farmers had already been there on the same errand from different parts of the country
By the sun moon and stars by the clouds the winds the trees and grass the candleflame and swallows the smell of the herbs likewise by the cats eyes the ravens the leeches the spiders and the dungmixen the last fortnight in August will berain and tempest
You are not certain of course
As one can be in a world where alls unsure
Twill be more like living in Revelations this autumn than in England
Shall I sketch it out for ee in a scheme
O no no said Henchard
I dont altogether believe in forecasts come to second thoughts on such
But I You dontyou donttis quite understood said Wideoh without a sound of scorn
You have given me a crown because youve one too many
But wont you join me at supper now tis waiting and all
Henchard would gladly have joined for the savour of the stew had floated from the cottage into the porch with such appetizing distinctness that the meat the onions the pepper and the herbs could be severally recognized by his nose
But as sitting down to hobandnob there would have seemed to mark him too implicitly as the weathercasters apostle he declined and went his way
The next Saturday Henchard bought grain to such an enormous extent that there was quite a talk about his purchases among his neighbours the lawyer the wine merchant and the doctor also on the next and on all available days
When his granaries were full to choking all the weathercocks of Casterbridge creaked and set their faces in another direction as if tired of the southwest
The weather changed the sunlight which had been like tin for weeks assumed the hues of topaz
The temperament of the welkin passed from the phlegmatic to the sanguine an excellent harvest was almost a certainty and as a consequence prices rushed down
All these transformations lovely to the outsider to the wrongheaded corndealer were terrible
He was reminded of what he had well known before that a man might gamble upon the square green areas of fields as readily as upon those of a cardroom
Henchard had backed bad weather and apparently lost
He had mistaken the turn of the flood for the turn of the ebb
His dealings had been so extensive that settlement could not long be postponed and to settle he was obliged to sell off corn that he had bought only a few weeks before at figures higher by many shillings a quarter
Much of the corn he had never seen it had not even been moved from the ricks in which it lay stacked miles away
Thus he lost heavily
In the blaze of an early August day he met Farfrae in the marketplace
Farfrae knew of his dealings though he did not guess their intended bearing on himself and commiserated him for since their exchange of words in the South Walk they had been on stiffly speaking terms
Henchard for the moment appeared to resent the sympathy but he suddenly took a careless turn
Ho no nonothing serious man
he cried with fierce gaiety
These things always happen dont they
I know it has been said that figures have touched me tight lately but is that anything rare
The case is not so bad as folk make out perhaps
And dammy a man must be a fool to mind the common hazards of trade
But he had to enter the Casterbridge Bank that day for reasons which had never before sent him thereand to sit a long time in the partners room with a constrained bearing
It was rumoured soon after that much real property as well as vast stores of produce which had stood in Henchards name in the town and neighbourhood was actually the possession of his bankers
Coming down the steps of the bank he encountered Jopp
The gloomy transactions just completed within had added fever to the original sting of Farfraes sympathy that morning which Henchard fancied might be a satire disguised so that Jopp met with anything but a bland reception
The latter was in the act of taking off his hat to wipe his forehead and saying A fine hot day to an acquaintance
You can wipe and wipe and say A fine hot day can ye
cried Henchard in a savage undertone imprisoning Jopp between himself and the bank wall
If it hadnt been for your blasted advice it might have been a fine day enough
Why did ye let me go on heywhen a word of doubt from you or anybody would have made me think twice
For you can never be sure of weather till tis past
My advice sir was to do what you thought best
A useful fellow
And the sooner you help somebody else in that way the better
Henchard continued his address to Jopp in similar terms till it ended in Jopp s dismissal there and then Henchard turning upon his heel and leaving him
You shall be sorry for this sir sorry as a man can be
said Jopp standing pale and looking after the corn merchant as he disappeared in the crowd of marketmen hard by
27
It was the eve of harvest
Prices being low Farfrae was buying
As was usual after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers had flown to the other extreme and in Farfraes opinion were selling off too recklessly calculating with just a trifle too much certainty upon an abundant yield
So he went on buying old corn at its comparatively ridiculous price for the produce of the previous year though not large had been of excellent quality
When Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way and got rid of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss the harvest began
There were three days of excellent weather and thenWhat if that curst conjuror should be right after all
said Henchard
The fact was that no sooner had the sickles begun to play than the atmosphere suddenly felt as if cress would grow in it without other nourishment
It rubbed peoples cheeks like damp flannel when they walked abroad
There was a gusty high warm wind isolated raindrops starred the windowpanes at remote distances the sunlight would flap out like a quickly opened fan throw the pattern of the window upon the floor of the room in a milky colourless shine and withdraw as suddenly as it had appeared
From that day and hour it was clear that there was not to be so successful an ingathering after all
If Henchard had only waited long enough he might at least have avoided loss though he had not made a profit
But the momentum of his character knew no patience
At this turn of the scales he remained silent
The movements of his mind seemed to tend to the thought that some power was working against him
I wonder he asked himself with eerie misgiving I wonder if it can be that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me or stirring an unholy brew to confound me
I dont believe in such power and yetwhat if they should ha been doing it
Even he could not admit that the perpetrator if any might be Farfrae
These isolated hours of superstition came to Henchard in time of moody depression when all his practical largeness of view had oozed out of him
Meanwhile Donald Farfrae prospered
He had purchased in so depressed a market that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to pile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been
Why hell soon be Mayor
said Henchard
It was indeed hard that the speaker should of all others have to follow the triumphal chariot of this man to the Capitol
The rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men
Septembernight shades had fallen upon Casterbridge the clocks had struck halfpast eight and the moon had risen
The streets of the town were curiously silent for such a comparatively early hour
A sound of jangling horsebells and heavy wheels passed up the street
These were followed by angry voices outside Lucettas house which led her and ElizabethJane to run to the windows and pull up the blinds
The neighbouring Market House and Town Hall abutted against its next neighbour the Church except in the lower storey where an arched thoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called Bull Stake
A stone post rose in the midst to which the oxen had formerly been tied for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in the adjoining shambles
In a corner stood the stocks
The thoroughfare leading to this spot was now blocked by two fourhorse waggons and horses one laden with haytrusses the leaders having already passed each other and become entangled head to tail
The passage of the vehicles might have been practicable if empty but built up with hay to the bedroom windows as one was it was impossible
You must have done it a purpose
said Farfraes waggoner
You can hear my horses bells halfamile such a night as this
If yed been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawkhammer way you would have zeed me
retorted the wroth representative of Henchard
However according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that Henchards man was most in the wrong he therefore attempted to back into the High Street
In doing this the near hindwheel rose against the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over two of the four wheels rising in the air and the legs of the thill horse
Instead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in a fight with their fists
Before the first round was quite over Henchard came upon the spot somebody having run for him
Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring one with each hand turned to the horse that was down and extricated him after some trouble
He then inquired into the circumstances and seeing the state of his waggon and its load began hotly rating Farfraes man
Lucetta and ElizabethJane had by this time run down to the street corner whence they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the moons rays and passed and repassed by the forms of Henchard and the waggoners
The women had witnessed what nobody else had seenthe origin of the mishap and Lucetta spoke
I saw it all Mr Henchard she cried and your man was most in the wrong
Henchard paused in his harangue and turned
Oh I didnt notice you Miss Templeman said he
My man in the wrong
Ah to be sure to be sure
But I beg your pardon notwithstanding
The others is the empty waggon and he must have been most to blame for coming on
No I saw it too said ElizabethJane
And I can assure you he couldnt help it
You cant trust THEIR senses
murmured Henchards man
Why not
asked Henchard sharply
Why you see sir all the women side with Farfraebeing a damn young dandof the sort that he isone that creeps into a maids heart like the giddying worm into a sheeps brainmaking crooked seem straight to their eyes
But do you know who that lady is you talk about in such a fashion
Do you know that I pay my attentions to her and have for some time
Just be careful
Not I I know nothing sir outside eight shillings a week
And that Mr Farfrae is well aware of it
Hes sharp in trade but he wouldnt do anything so underhand as what you hint at
Whether because Lucetta heard this low dialogue or not her white figure disappeared from her doorway inward and the door was shut before Henchard could reach it to converse with her further
This disappointed him for he had been sufficiently disturbed by what the man had said to wish to speak to her more closely
While pausing the old constable came up
Just see that nobody drives against that hay and waggon to night Stubberd said the cornmerchant
It must bide till the morning for all hands are in the field still
And if any coach or roadwaggon wants to come along tell em they must go round by the back street and be hanged to emAny case tomorrow up in Hall
Yes sir
One in number sir
Oh whats that
An old flagrant female sir swearing and committing a nuisance in a horrible profane manner against the church wall sir as if twere no more than a pothouse
Thats all sir
Oh
The Mayors out o town isnt he
He is sir
Very well then Ill be there
Dont forget to keep an eye on that hay
Good night t ee
During those moments Henchard had determined to follow up Lucetta notwithstanding her elusiveness and he knocked for admission
The answer he received was an expression of Miss Templemans sorrow at being unable to see him again that evening because she had an engagement to go out
Henchard walked away from the door to the opposite side of the street and stood by his hay in a lonely reverie the constable having strolled elsewhere and the horses being removed
Though the moon was not bright as yet there were no lamps lighted and he entered the shadow of one of the projecting jambs which formed the thoroughfare to Bull Stake here he watched Lucettas door
Candlelights were flitting in and out of her bedroom and it was obvious that she was dressing for the appointment whatever the nature of that might be at such an hour
The lights disappeared the clock struck nine and almost at the moment Farfrae came round the opposite corner and knocked
That she had been waiting just inside for him was certain for she instantly opened the door herself
They went together by the way of a back lane westward avoiding the front street guessing where they were going he determined to follow
The harvest had been so delayed by the capricious weather that whenever a fine day occurred all sinews were strained to save what could be saved of the damaged crops
On account of the rapid shortening of the days the harvesters worked by moonlight
Hence tonight the wheatfields abutting on the two sides of the square formed by Casterbridge town were animated by the gathering hands
Their shouts and laughter had reached Henchard at the Market House while he stood there waiting and he had little doubt from the turn which Farfrae and Lucetta had taken that they were bound for the spot
Nearly the whole town had gone into the fields
The Casterbridge populace still retained the primitive habit of helping one another in time of need and thus though the corn belonged to the farming section of the little communitythat inhabiting the Durnover quarterthe remainder was no less interested in the labour of getting it home
Reaching the top of the lane Henchard crossed the shaded avenue on the walls slid down the green rampart and stood amongst the stubble
The stitches or shocks rose like tents about the yellow expanse those in the distance becoming lost in the moonlit hazes
He had entered at a point removed from the scene of immediate operations but two others had entered at that place and he could see them winding among the shocks
They were paying no regard to the direction of their walk whose vague serpentining soon began to bear down towards Henchard
A meeting promised to be awkward and he therefore stepped into the hollow of the nearest shock and sat down
You have my leave Lucetta was saying gaily
Speak what you like
Well then replied Farfrae with the unmistakable inflection of the lover pure which Henchard had never heard in full resonance of his lips before you are sure to be much sought after for your position wealth talents and beauty
But will ye resist the temptation to be one of those ladies with lots of admirersayand be content to have only a homely one
And he the speaker
said she laughing
Very well sir what next
Ah
Im afraid that what I feel will make me forget my manners
Then I hope youll never have any if you lack them only for that cause
After some broken words which Henchard lost she added Are you sure you wont be jealous
Farfrae seemed to assure her that he would not by taking her hand
You are convinced Donald that I love nobody else she presently said
But I should wish to have my own way in some things
In everything
What special thing did you mean
If I wished not to live always in Casterbridge for instance upon finding that I should not be happy here
Henchard did not hear the reply he might have done so and much more but he did not care to play the eavesdropper
They went on towards the scene of activity where the sheaves were being handed a dozen a minute upon the carts and waggons which carried them away
Lucetta insisted on parting from Farfrae when they drew near the workpeople
He had some business with them and thought he entreated her to wait a few minutes she was inexorable and tripped off homeward alone
Henchard thereupon left the field and followed her
His state of mind was such that on reaching Lucettas door he did not knock but opened it and walked straight up to her sittingroom expecting to find her there
But the room was empty and he perceived that in his haste he had somehow passed her on the way hither
He had not to wait many minutes however for he soon heard her dress rustling in the hall followed by a soft closing of the door
In a moment she appeared
The light was so low that she did not notice Henchard at first
As soon as she saw him she uttered a little cry almost of terror
How can you frighten me so
she exclaimed with a flushed face
It is past ten oclock and you have no right to surprise me here at such a time
I dont know that Ive not the right
At any rate I have the excuse
Is it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs
It is too late for propriety and might injure me
I called an hour ago and you would not see me and I thought you were in when I called now
It is you Lucetta who are doing wrong
It is not proper in ee to throw me over like this
I have a little matter to remind you of which you seem to forget
She sank into a chair and turned pale
I dont want to hear itI dont want to hear it
she said through her hands as he standing close to the edge of her gown began to allude to the Jersey days
But you ought to hear it said he
It came to nothing and through you
Then why not leave me the freedom that I gained with such sorrow
Had I found that you proposed to marry me for pure love I might have felt bound now
But I soon learnt that you had planned it out of mere charityalmost as an unpleasant dutybecause I had nursed you and compromised myself and you thought you must repay me
After that I did not care for you so deeply as before
Why did you come here to find me then
I thought I ought to marry you for conscience sake since you were free even though Idid not like you so well
And why then dont you think so now
She was silent
It was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well enough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule
In feeling this she herself forgot for the moment her partially justifying argumentthat having discovered Henchards infirmities of temper she had some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once escaping them
The only thing she could say was I was a poor girl then and now my circumstances have altered so I am hardly the same person
Thats true
And it makes the case awkward for me
But I dont want to touch your money
I am quite willing that every penny of your property shall remain to your personal use
Besides that argument has nothing in it
The man you are thinking of is no better than I
If you were as good as he you would leave me
she cried passionately
This unluckily aroused Henchard
You cannot in honour refuse me he said
And unless you give me your promise this very night to be my wife before a witness Ill reveal our intimacyin common fairness to other men
A look of resignation settled upon her
Henchard saw its bitterness and had Lucettas heart been given to any other man in the world than Farfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment
But the supplanter was the upstart as Henchard called him who had mounted into prominence upon his shoulders and he could bring himself to show no mercy
Without another word she rang the bell and directed that ElizabethJane should be fetched from her room
The latter appeared surprised in the midst of her lucubrations
As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully
ElizabethJane he said taking her hand I want you to hear this
And turning to Lucetta Will you or will you not marry me
If youwish it I must agree
You say yes
I do
No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state
What dreadful thing drives her to say this father when it is such a pain to her
asked Elizabeth kneeling down by Lucetta
Dont compel her to do anything against her will
I have lived with her and know that she cannot bear much
Dont be a nothern simpleton
said Henchard drily
This promise will leave him free for you if you want him wont it
At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start
Him
Who are you talking about
she said wildly
Nobody as far as I am concerned said Elizabeth firmly
Ohwell
Then it is my mistake said Henchard
But the business is between me and Miss Templeman
She agrees to be my wife
But dont dwell on it just now entreated Elizabeth holding Lucettas hand
I dont wish to if she promises said Henchard
I have I have groaned Lucetta her limbs hanging like fluid from very misery and faintness
Michael please dont argue it any more
I will not he said
And taking up his hat he went away
ElizabethJane continued to kneel by Lucetta
What is this
she said
You called my father Michael as if you knew him well
And how is it he has got this power over you that you promise to marry him against your will
Ahyou have many many secrets from me
Perhaps you have some from me Lucetta murmured with closed eyes little thinking however so unsuspicious was she that the secret of Elizabeths heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own
I would notdo anything against you at all
stammered Elizabeth keeping in all signs of emotion till she was ready to burst
I cannot understand how my father can command you so I dont sympathize with him in it at all
Ill go to him and ask him to release you
No no said Lucetta
Let it all be
28
The next morning Henchard went to the Town Hall below Lucettas house to attend Petty Sessions being still a magistrate for the year by virtue of his late position as Mayor
In passing he looked up at her windows but nothing of her was to be seen
Henchard as a Justice of the Peace may at first seem to be an even greater incongruity than Shallow and Silence themselves
But his rough and ready perceptions his sledgehammer directness had often served him better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple business as fell to his hands in this Court
Today Dr Chalkfield the Mayor for the year being absent the cornmerchant took the big chair his eyes still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar front of HighPlace Hall
There was one case only and the offender stood before him
She was an old woman of mottled countenance attired in a shawl of that nameless tertiary hue which comes but cannot be madea hue neither tawny russet hazel nor ash a sticky black bonnet that seemed to have been worn in the country of the Psalmist where the clouds drop fatness and an apron that had been white in time so comparatively recent as still to contrast visibly with the rest of her clothes
The steeped aspect of the woman as a whole showed her to be no native of the countryside or even of a countrytown
She looked cursorily at Henchard and the second magistrate and Henchard looked at her with a momentary pause as if she had reminded him indistinctly of somebody or something which passed from his mind as quickly as it had come
Well and what has she been doing
he said looking down at the charge sheet
She is charged sir with the offence of disorderly female and nuisance whispered Stubberd
Where did she do that
said the other magistrate
By the church sir of all the horrible places in the worldI caught her in the act your worship
Stand back then said Henchard and lets hear what youve got to say
Stubberd was sworn in the magistrates clerk dipped his pen Henchard being no notetaker himself and the constable began Hearing a illegal noise I went down the street at twenty five minutes past eleven PM on the night of the fifth instinct Hannah Dominy
When I had Dont go so fast Stubberd said the clerk
The constable waited with his eyes on the clerks pen till the latter stopped scratching and said yes
Stubberd continued When I had proceeded to the spot I saw defendant at another spot namely the gutter
He paused watching the point of the clerks pen again
Gutter yes Stubberd
Spot measuring twelve feet nine inches or thereabouts from where I Still careful not to outrun the clerks penmanship Stubberd pulled up again for having got his evidence by heart it was immaterial to him whereabouts he broke off
I object to that spoke up the old woman spot measuring twelve feet nine or thereabouts from where I is not sound testimony
The magistrates consulted and the second one said that the bench was of opinion that twelve feet nine inches from a man on his oath was admissible
Stubberd with a suppressed gaze of victorious rectitude at the old woman continued Was standing myself
She was wambling about quite dangerous to the thoroughfare and when I approached to draw near she committed the nuisance and insulted me
Insulted me
Yes what did she say
She said Put away that dee lantern she says
Yes
Says she Dost hear old turmithead
Put away that dee lantern
I have floored fellows a dee sight finerlooking than a dee fool like thee you son of a bee dee me if I haint she says
I object to that conversation
interposed the old woman
I was not capable enough to hear what I said and what is said out of my hearing is not evidence
There was another stoppage for consultation a book was referred to and finally Stubberd was allowed to go on again
The truth was that the old woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates themselves that they were obliged to keep a sharp lookout upon their procedure
However when Stubberd had rambled on a little further Henchard broke out impatiently Comewe dont want to hear any more of them cust dees and bees
Say the words out like a man and dont be so modest Stubberd or else leave it alone
Turning to the woman Now then have you any questions to ask him or anything to say
Yes she replied with a twinkle in her eye and the clerk dipped his pen
Twenty years ago or thereabout I was selling of furmity in a tent at Weydon Fair Twenty years agowell thats beginning at the beginning suppose you go back to the Creation
said the clerk not without satire
But Henchard stared and quite forgot what was evidence and what was not
A man and a woman with a little child came into my tent the woman continued
They sat down and had a basin apiece
Ah Lords my life
I was of a more respectable station in the world then than I am now being a land smuggler in a large way of business and I used to season my furmity with rum for them who asked fort
I did it for the man and then he had more and more till at last he quarrelled with his wife and offered to sell her to the highest bidder
A sailor came in and bid five guineas and paid the money and led her away
And the man who sold his wife in that fashion is the man sitting there in the great big chair
The speaker concluded by nodding her head at Henchard and folding her arms
Everybody looked at Henchard
His face seemed strange and in tint as if it had been powdered over with ashes
We dont want to hear your life and adventures said the second magistrate sharply filling the pause which followed
Youve been asked if youve anything to say bearing on the case
That bears on the case
It proves that hes no better than I and has no right to sit there in judgment upon me
Tis a concocted story said the clerk
So hold your tongue
Notis true
The words came from Henchard
Tis as true as the light he said slowly
And upon my soul it does prove that Im no better than she
And to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for her revenge Ill leave her to you
The sensation in the court was indescribably great
Henchard left the chair and came out passing through a group of people on the steps and outside that was much larger than usual for it seemed that the old furmity dealer had mysteriously hinted to the denizens of the lane in which she had been lodging since her arrival that she knew a queer thing or two about their great local man Mr Henchard if she chose to tell it
This had brought them hither
Why are there so many idlers round the Town Hall today
said Lucetta to her servant when the case was over
She had risen late and had just looked out of the window
Oh please maam tis this larry about Mr Henchard
A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair
In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years of his belief in her death and so on he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation
The story she now heard for the first time
A gradual misery overspread Lucettas face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before
At bottom then Henchard was this
How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care
During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places not coming in till nearly dusk
As soon as she saw ElizabethJane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few daysto PortBredy Casterbridge was so gloomy
Elizabeth seeing that she looked wan and disturbed encouraged her in the idea thinking a change would afford her relief
She could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge in Lucettas eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was away from home
Elizabeth saw her friend depart for PortBredy and took charge of HighPlace Hall till her return
After two or three days of solitude and incessant rain Henchard called at the house
He seemed disappointed to hear of Lucettas absence and though he nodded with outward indifference he went away handling his beard with a nettled mien
The next day he called again
Is she come now
he asked
Yes
She returned this morning replied his step daughter
But she is not indoors
She has gone for a walk along the turnpikeroad to PortBredy
She will be home by dusk
After a few words which only served to reveal his restless impatience he left the house again
29
At this hour Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port Bredy just as Elizabeth had announced
That she had chosen for her afternoon walk the road along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier in a carriage was curiousif anything should be called curious in concatenations of phenomena wherein each is known to have its accounting cause
It was the day of the chief market Saturdayand Farfrae for once had been missed from his cornstand in the dealers room
Nevertheless it was known that he would be home that nightfor Sunday as Casterbridge expressed it
Lucetta in continuing her walk had at length reached the end of the ranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions out of the town
This end marked a mile and here she stopped
The spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities and the road still adhering to its Roman foundation stretched onward straight as a surveyors line till lost to sight on the most distant ridge
There was neither hedge nor tree in the prospect now the road clinging to the stubby expanse of cornland like a strip to an undulating garment
Near her was a barnthe single building of any kind within her horizon
She strained her eyes up the lessening road but nothing appeared thereonnot so much as a speck
She sighed one wordDonald
and turned her face to the town for retreat
Here the case was different
A single figure was approaching herElizabethJanes
Lucetta in spite of her loneliness seemed a little vexed
Elizabeths face as soon as she recognized her friend shaped itself into affectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance
I suddenly thought I would come and meet you she said smiling
Lucettas reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion
A byroad on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway at the point where she stood and down the track a bull was rambling uncertainly towards her and Elizabeth who facing the other way did not observe him
In the latter quarter of each year cattle were at once the mainstay and the terror of families about Casterbridge and its neighbourhood where breeding was carried on with Abrahamic success
The head of stock driven into and out of the town at this season to be sold by the local auctioneer was very large and all these horned beasts in travelling to and fro sent women and children to shelter as nothing else could do
In the main the animals would have walked along quietly enough but the Casterbridge tradition was that to drive stock it was indispensable that hideous cries coupled with Yahoo antics and gestures should be used large sticks flourished stray dogs called in and in general everything done that was likely to infuriate the viciously disposed and terrify the mild
Nothing was commoner than for a householder on going out of his parlour to find his hall or passage full of little children nursemaids aged women or a ladies school who apologized for their presence by saying A bull passing down street from the sale
Lucetta and Elizabeth regarded the animal in doubt he meanwhile drawing vaguely towards them
It was a large specimen of the breed in colour rich dun though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about his seamy sides
His horns were thick and tipped with brass his two nostrils like the Thames Tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of yore
Between them through the gristle of his nose was a stout copper ring welded on and irremovable as Gurths collar of brass
To the ring was attached an ash staff about a yard long which the bull with the motions of his head flung about like a flail
It was not till they observed this dangling stick that the young women were really alarmed for it revealed to them that the bull was an old one too savage to be driven which had in some way escaped the staff being the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns at arms length
They looked round for some shelter or hidingplace and thought of the barn hard by
As long as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had shown some deference in his manner of approach but no sooner did they turn their backs to seek the barn than he tossed his head and decided to thoroughly terrify them
This caused the two helpless girls to run wildly whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge
The barn stood behind a green slimy pond and it was closed save as to one of the usual pair of doors facing them which had been propped open by a hurdlestick and for this opening they made
The interior had been cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end where there was a stack of dry clover
ElizabethJane took in the situation
We must climb up there she said
But before they had even approached it they heard the bull scampering through the pond without and in a second he dashed into the barn knocking down the hurdlestake in passing the heavy door slammed behind him and all three were imprisoned in the barn together
The mistaken creature saw them and stalked towards the end of the barn into which they had fled
The girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was against the wall when the fugitives were already half way to the other end
By the time that his length would allow him to turn and follow them thither they had crossed over thus the pursuit went on the hot air from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco and not a moment being attainable by Elizabeth or Lucetta in which to open the door
What might have happened had their situation continued cannot be said but in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted their adversarys attention and a man appeared
He ran forward towards the leadingstaff seized it and wrenched the animals head as if he would snap it off
The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed to have lost its stiffness and to become half paralyzed whilst the nose dropped blood
The premeditated human contrivance of the nosering was too cunning for impulsive brute force and the creature flinched
The man was seen in the partial gloom to be largeframed and unhesitating
He led the bull to the door and the light revealed Henchard
He made the bull fast without and re entered to the succour of Lucetta for he had not perceived Elizabeth who had climbed on to the cloverheap
Lucetta was hysterical and Henchard took her in his arms and carried her to the door
Youhave saved me
she cried as soon as she could speak
I have returned your kindness he responded tenderly
You once saved me
Howcomes it to be youyou
she asked not heeding his reply
I came out here to look for you
I have been wanting to tell you something these two or three days but you have been away and I could not
Perhaps you cannot talk now
Ohno
Where is Elizabeth
Here am I
cried the missing one cheerfully and without waiting for the ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the cloverstack to the floor
Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side and ElizabethJane on the other they went slowly along the rising road
They had reached the top and were descending again when Lucetta now much recovered recollected that she had dropped her muff in the barn
Ill run back said ElizabethJane
I dont mind it at all as I am not tired as you are
She thereupon hastened down again to the barn the others pursuing their way
Elizabeth soon found the muff such an article being by no means small at that time
Coming out she paused to look for a moment at the bull now rather to be pitied with his bleeding nose having perhaps rather intended a practical joke than a murder
Henchard had secured him by jamming the staff into the hinge of the barndoor and wedging it there with a stake
At length she turned to hasten onward after her contemplation when she saw a greenandblack gig approaching from the contrary direction the vehicle being driven by Farfrae
His presence here seemed to explain Lucettas walk that way
Donald saw her drew up and was hastily made acquainted with what had occurred
At ElizabethJane mentioning how greatly Lucetta had been jeopardized he exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity from any she had seen in him before
He became so absorbed in the circumstance that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was doing to think of helping her up beside him
She has gone on with Mr Henchard you say
he inquired at last
Yes
He is taking her home
They are almost there by this time
And you are sure she can get home
ElizabethJane was quite sure
Your stepfather saved her
Entirely
Farfrae checked his horses pace she guessed why
He was thinking that it would be best not to intrude on the other two just now
Henchard had saved Lucetta and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise
The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover but soon the two figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town
The face of the woman was frequently turned back but Farfrae did not whip on the horse
When these reached the town walls Henchard and his companion had disappeared down the street Farfrae set down ElizabethJane on her expressing a particular wish to alight there and drove round to the stables at the back of his lodgings
On this account he entered the house through his garden and going up to his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state his boxes being hauled out upon the landing and his bookcase standing in three pieces
These phenomena however seemed to cause him not the least surprise
When will everything be sent up
he said to the mistress of the house who was superintending
I am afraid not before eight sir said she
You see we wasnt aware till this morning that you were going to move or we could have been forwarder
Awell never mind never mind
said Farfrae cheerily
Eight oclock will do well enough if it be not later
Now dont ye be standing here talking or it will be twelve I doubt
Thus speaking he went out by the front door and up the street
During this interval Henchard and Lucetta had had experiences of a different kind
After Elizabeths departure for the muff the cornmerchant opened himself frankly holding her hand within his arm though she would fain have withdrawn it
Dear Lucetta I have been very very anxious to see you these two or three days he said ever since I saw you last
I have thought over the way I got your promise that night
You said to me If I were a man I should not insist
That cut me deep
I felt that there was some truth in it
I dont want to make you wretched and to marry me just now would do that as nothing else couldit is but too plain
Therefore I agree to an indefinite engagementto put off all thought of marriage for a year or two
Butbutcan I do nothing of a different kind
said Lucetta
I am full of gratitude to youyou have saved my life
And your care of me is like coals of fire on my head
I am a monied person now
Surely I can do something in return for your goodnesssomething practical
Henchard remained in thought
He had evidently not expected this
There is one thing you might do Lucetta he said
But not exactly of that kind
Then of what kind is it
she asked with renewed misgiving
I must tell you a secret to ask itYou may have heard that I have been unlucky this year
I did what I have never done beforespeculated rashly and I lost
Thats just put me in a strait
And you would wish me to advance some money
No no
said Henchard almost in anger
Im not the man to sponge on a woman even though she may be so nearly my own as you
No Lucetta what you can do is this and it would save me
My great creditor is Grower and it is at his hands I shall suffer if at anybodys while a fortnights forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull through
This may be got out of him in one way that you would let it be known to him that you are my intendedthat we are to be quietly married in the next fortnightNow stop you havent heard all
Let him have this story without of course any prejudice to the fact that the actual engagement between us is to be a long one
Nobody else need know you could go with me to Mr Grower and just let me speak to ee before him as if we were on such terms
Well ask him to keep it secret
He will willingly wait then
At the fortnights end I shall be able to face him and I can coolly tell him all is postponed between us for a year or two
Not a soul in the town need know how youve helped me
Since you wish to be of use theres your way
It being now what the people called the pinking in of the day that is the quarterhour just before dusk he did not at first observe the result of his own words upon her
If it were anything else she began and the dryness of her lips was represented in her voice
But it is such a little thing
he said with a deep reproach
Less than you have offeredjust the beginning of what you have so lately promised
I could have told him as much myself but he would not have believed me
It is not because I wontit is because I absolutely cant she said with rising distress
You are provoking
he burst out
It is enough to make me force you to carry out at once what you have promised
I cannot
she insisted desperately
Why
When I have only within these few minutes released you from your promise to do the thing offhand
Becausehe was a witness
Witness
Of what
If I must tell you
Dont dont upbraid me
Well
Lets hear what you mean
Witness of my marriageMr Grower was
Marriage
Yes
With Mr Farfrae
O Michael
I am already his wife
We were married this week at PortBredy
There were reasons against our doing it here
Mr Grower was a witness because he happened to be at PortBredy at the time
Henchard stood as if idiotized
She was so alarmed at his silence that she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over the perilous fortnight
Married him
said Henchard at length
My goodwhat married him whilstbound to marry me
It was like this she explained with tears in her eyes and quavers in her voice dontdont be cruel
I loved him so much and I thought you might tell him of the past and that grieved me
And then when I had promised you I learnt of the rumour that you hadsold your first wife at a fair like a horse or cow
How could I keep my promise after hearing that
I could not risk myself in your hands it would have been letting myself down to take your name after such a scandal
But I knew I should lose Donald if I did not secure him at oncefor you would carry out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance as long as there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so
But you will not do so now will you Michael
for it is too late to separate us
The notes of St Peters bells in full peal had been wafted to them while he spoke and now the genial thumping of the town band renowned for its unstinted use of the drumstick throbbed down the street
Then this racket they are making is on account of it I suppose
said he
YesI think he has told them or else Mr Grower hasMay I leave you now
Myhe was detained at Port Bredy today and sent me on a few hours before him
Then it is HIS WIFES life I have saved this afternoon
Yesand he will be for ever grateful to you
I am much obliged to himO you false woman
burst from Henchard
You promised me
Yes yes
But it was under compulsion and I did not know all your past And now Ive a mind to punish you as you deserve
One word to this brannew husband of how you courted me and your precious happiness is blown to atoms
Michaelpity me and be generous
You dont deserve pity
You did but you dont now
Ill help you to pay off your debt
A pensioner of Farfraes wifenot I
Dont stay with me longerI shall say something worse
Go home
She disappeared under the trees of the south walk as the band came round the corner awaking the echoes of every stock and stone in celebration of her happiness
Lucetta took no heed but ran up the back street and reached her own home unperceived
30
Farfraes words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his boxes and other effects from his late lodgings to Lucettas house
The work was not heavy but it had been much hindered on account of the frequent pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event of which the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours earlier
At the last moment of leaving PortBredy Farfrae like John Gilpin had been detained by important customers whom even in the exceptional circumstances he was not the man to neglect
Moreover there was a convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house
Nobody there as yet knew what had happened and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates and give directions for her husbands accommodation
He had therefore sent on his twodays bride in a hired brougham whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening
This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours
By a strenuous effort after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive Donald at HighPlace Hall when he came on from his lodgings
One supreme fact empowered her to this the sense that come what would she had secured him
Halfanhour after her arrival he walked in and she met him with a relieved gladness which a months perilous absence could not have intensified
There is one thing I have not done and yet it is important she said earnestly when she had finished talking about the adventure with the bull
That is broken the news of our marriage to my dear ElizabethJane
Ah and you have not
he said thoughtfully
I gave her a lift from the barn homewards but I did not tell her either for I thought she might have heard of it in the town and was keeping back her congratulations from shyness and all that
She can hardly have heard of it
But Ill find out Ill go to her now
And Donald you dont mind her living on with me just the same as before
She is so quiet and unassuming
O no indeed I dont Farfrae answered with perhaps a faint awkwardness
But I wonder if she would care to
O yes
said Lucetta eagerly
I am sure she would like to
Besides poor thing she has no other home
Farfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of her more reserved friend
He liked her all the better for the blindness
Arrange as you like with her by all means he said
It is I who have come to your house not you to mine
Ill run and speak to her said Lucetta
When she got upstairs to ElizabethJanes room the latter had taken off her outdoor things and was resting over a book
Lucetta found in a moment that she had not yet learnt the news
I did not come down to you Miss Templeman she said simply
I was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright but I found you had a visitor
What are the bells ringing for I wonder
And the band too is playing
Somebody must be married or else they are practising for Christmas
Lucetta uttered a vague Yes and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her
What a lonely creature you are she presently said never knowing whats going on or what people are talking about everywhere with keen interest
You should get out and gossip about as other women do and then you wouldnt be obliged to ask me a question of that kind
Well now I have something to tell you
ElizabethJane said she was so glad and made herself receptive
I must go rather a long way back said Lucetta the difficulty of explaining herself satisfactorily to the pondering one beside her growing more apparent at each syllable
You remember that trying case of conscience I told you of some time agoabout the first lover and the second lover
She let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of the story she had told
O yesI remember the story of YOUR FRIEND said Elizabeth drily regarding the irises of Lucettas eyes as though to catch their exact shade
The two loversthe old one and the new how she wanted to marry the second but felt she ought to marry the first so that she neglected the better course to follow the evil like the poet Ovid Ive just been construing Video meliora proboque deteriora sequor
O no she didnt follow evil exactly
said Lucetta hastily
But you said that sheor as I may say youanswered Elizabeth dropping the mask were in honour and conscience bound to marry the first
Lucettas blush at being seen through came and went again before she replied anxiously You will never breathe this will you ElizabethJane
Certainly not if you say not
Then I will tell you that the case is more complicated worse in factthan it seemed in my story
I and the first man were thrown together in a strange way and felt that we ought to be united as the world had talked of us
He was a widower as he supposed
He had not heard of his first wife for many years
But the wife returned and we parted
She is now dead and the husband comes paying me addresses again saying Now well complete our purposes
But ElizabethJane all this amounts to a new courtship of me by him I was absolved from all vows by the return of the other woman
Have you not lately renewed your promise
said the younger with quiet surmise
She had divined Man Number One
That was wrung from me by a threat
Yes it was
But I think when any one gets coupled up with a man in the past so unfortunately as you have done she ought to become his wife if she can even if she were not the sinning party
Lucettas countenance lost its sparkle
He turned out to be a man I should be afraid to marry she pleaded
Really afraid
And it was not till after my renewed promise that I knew it
Then there is only one course left to honesty
You must remain a single woman
But think again
Do consider I am certain interrupted her companion hardily
I have guessed very well who the man is
My father and I say it is him or nobody for you
Any suspicion of impropriety was to ElizabethJane like a red rag to a bull
Her craving for correctness of procedure was indeed almost vicious
Owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a semblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names are safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of
You ought to marry Mr Henchard or nobodycertainly not another man
she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared
I dont admit that
said Lucetta passionately
Admit it or not it is true
Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand as if she could plead no more holding out her left to ElizabethJane
Why you HAVE married him
cried the latter jumping up with pleasure after a glance at Lucettas fingers
When did you do it
Why did you not tell me instead of teasing me like this
How very honourable of you
He did treat my mother badly once it seems in a moment of intoxication
And it is true that he is stern sometimes
But you will rule him entirely I am sure with your beauty and wealth and accomplishments
You are the woman he will adore and we shall all three be happy together now
O my ElizabethJane
cried Lucetta distressfully
Tis somebody else that I have married
I was so desperateso afraid of being forced to anything elseso afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me that I resolved to do it offhand come what might and purchase a week of happiness at any cost
Youhavemarried Mr
Farfrae
cried ElizabethJane in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed
She had recovered herself
The bells are ringing on that account she said
My husband is downstairs
He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as before
Let me think of it alone the girl quickly replied corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control
You shall
I am sure we shall be happy together
Lucetta departed to join Donald below a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there
Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it for of the bearings of ElizabethJanes emotions she had not the least suspicion but on Henchards alone
Now the instant decision of Susan Henchards daughter was to dwell in that house no more
Apart from her estimate of the propriety of Lucettas conduct Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she felt she could not abide there
It was still early in the evening when she hastily put on her things and went out
In a few minutes knowing the ground she had found a suitable lodging and arranged to enter it that night
Returning and entering noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and arrayed herself in a plain one packing up the other to keep as her best for she would have to be very economical now
She wrote a note to leave for Lucetta who was closely shut up in the drawingroom with Farfrae and then ElizabethJane called a man with a wheelbarrow and seeing her boxes put into it she trotted off down the street to her rooms
They were in the street in which Henchard lived and almost opposite his door
Here she sat down and considered the means of subsistence
The little annual sum settled on her by her stepfather would keep body and soul together
A wonderful skill in netting of all sortsacquired in childhood by making seines in Newsons homemight serve her in good stead and her studies which were pursued unremittingly might serve her in still better
By this time the marriage that had taken place was known throughout Casterbridge had been discussed noisily on kerbstones confidentially behind counters and jovially at the Three Mariners
Whether Farfrae would sell his business and set up for a gentleman on his wifes money or whether he would show independence enough to stick to his trade in spite of his brilliant alliance was a great point of interest
31
The retort of the furmitywoman before the magistrates had spread and in fourandtwenty hours there was not a person in Casterbridge who remained unacquainted with the story of Henchards mad freak at WeydonPriors Fair long years before
The amends he had made in after life were lost sight of in the dramatic glare of the original act
Had the incident been well known of old and always it might by this time have grown to be lightly regarded as the rather tall wild oat but wellnigh the single one of a young man with whom the steady and mature if somewhat headstrong burgher of today had scarcely a point in common
But the act having lain as dead and buried ever since the interspace of years was unperceived and the black spot of his youth wore the aspect of a recent crime
Small as the policecourt incident had been in itself it formed the edge or turn in the incline of Henchards fortunes
On that dayalmost at that minutehe passed the ridge of prosperity and honour and began to descend rapidly on the other side
It was strange how soon he sank in esteem
Socially he had received a startling fillip downwards and having already lost commercial buoyancy from rash transactions the velocity of his descent in both aspects became accelerated every hour
He now gazed more at the pavements and less at the house fronts when he walked about more at the feet and leggings of men and less into the pupils of their eyes with the blazing regard which formerly had made them blink
New events combined to undo him
It had been a bad year for others besides himself and the heavy failure of a debtor whom he had trusted generously completed the overthrow of his tottering credit
And now in his desperation he failed to preserve that strict correspondence between bulk and sample which is the soul of commerce in grain
For this one of his men was mainly to blame that worthy in his great unwisdom having picked over the sample of an enormous quantity of secondrate corn which Henchard had in hand and removed the pinched blasted and smutted grains in great numbers
The produce if honestly offered would have created no scandal but the blunder of misrepresentation coming at such a moment dragged Henchards name into the ditch
The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind
One day ElizabethJane was passing the Kings Arms when she saw people bustling in and out more than usual where there was no market
A bystander informed her with some surprise at her ignorance that it was a meeting of the Commissioners under Mr Henchards bankruptcy
She felt quite tearful and when she heard that he was present in the hotel she wished to go in and see him but was advised not to intrude that day
The room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one and Henchard looking out of the window had caught sight of ElizabethJane through the wire blind
His examination had closed and the creditors were leaving
The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a reverie till turning his face from the window and towering above all the rest he called their attention for a moment more
His countenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity the black hair and whiskers were the same as ever but a film of ash was over the rest
Gentlemen he said over and above the assets that weve been talking about and that appear on the balancesheet there be these
It all belongs to ye as much as everything else Ive got and I dont wish to keep it from you not I
Saying this he took his gold watch from his pocket and laid it on the table then his pursethe yellow canvas money bag such as was carried by all farmers and dealersuntying it and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch
The latter he drew back quickly for an instant to remove the hairguard made and given him by Lucetta
There now you have all Ive got in the world he said
And I wish for your sakes twas more
The creditors farmers almost to a man looked at the watch and at the money and into the street when Farmer James Everdene of Weatherbury spoke
No no Henchard he said warmly
We dont want that
Tis honourable in ye but keep it
What do you say neighboursdo ye agree
Ay sure we dont wish it at all said Grower another creditor
Let him keep it of course murmured another in the backgrounda silent reserved young man named Boldwood and the rest responded unanimously
Well said the senior Commissioner addressing Henchard though the case is a desperate one I am bound to admit that I have never met a debtor who behaved more fairly
Ive proved the balancesheet to be as honestly made out as it could possibly be we have had no trouble there have been no evasions and no concealments
The rashness of dealing which led to this unhappy situation is obvious enough but as far as I can see every attempt has been made to avoid wronging anybody
Henchard was more affected by this than he cared to let them perceive and he turned aside to the window again
A general murmur of agreement followed the Commissioners words and the meeting dispersed
When they were gone Henchard regarded the watch they had returned to him
Tisnt mine by rights he said to himself
Why the devil didnt they take itI dont want what dont belong to me
Moved by a recollection he took the watch to the makers just opposite sold it there and then for what the tradesman offered and went with the proceeds to one among the smaller of his creditors a cottager of Durnover in straitened circumstances to whom he handed the money
When everything was ticketed that Henchard had owned and the auctions were in progress there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town which till then for some time past had done nothing but condemn him
Now that Henchards whole career was pictured distinctly to his neighbours and they could see how admirably he had used his one talent of energy to create a position of affluence out of absolutely nothing which was really all he could show when he came to the town as a journeyman haytrusser with his wimble and knife in his basketthey wondered and regretted his fall
Try as she might Elizabeth could never meet with him
She believed in him still though nobody else did and she wanted to be allowed to forgive him for his roughness to her and to help him in his trouble
She wrote to him he did not reply
She then went to his housethe great house she had lived in so happily for a timewith its front of dun brick vitrified here and there and its heavy sashbarsbut Henchard was to be found there no more
The exMayor had left the home of his prosperity and gone into Jopps cottage by the Priory Millthe sad purlieu to which he had wandered on the night of his discovery that she was not his daughter
Thither she went
Elizabeth thought it odd that he had fixed on this spot to retire to but assumed that necessity had no choice
Trees which seemed old enough to have been planted by the friars still stood around and the back hatch of the original mill yet formed a cascade which had raised its terrific roar for centuries
The cottage itself was built of old stones from the long dismantled Priory scraps of tracery moulded windowjambs and archlabels being mixed in with the rubble of the walls
In this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms Jopp whom Henchard had employed abused cajoled and dismissed by turns being the householder
But even here her stepfather could not be seen
Not by his daughter
pleaded Elizabeth
By nobodyat present thats his order she was informed
Afterwards she was passing by the cornstores and haybarns which had been the headquarters of his business
She knew that he ruled there no longer but it was with amazement that she regarded the familiar gateway
A smear of decisive leadcoloured paint had been laid on to obliterate Henchards name though its letters dimly loomed through like ships in a fog
Over these in fresh white spread the name of Farfrae
Abel Whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket and she said Mr Farfrae is master here
Yaas Miss Henchet he said Mr Farfrae have bought the concern and all of we workfolk with it and tis better for us than twasthough I shouldnt say that to you as a daughterlaw
We work harder but we baint made afeard now
It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin
No busting out no slamming of doors no meddling with yer eternal soul and all that and though tis a shilling a week less Im the richer man for whats all the world if yer mind is always in a larry Miss Henchet
The intelligence was in a general sense true and Henchards stores which had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of his bankruptcy were stirred into activity again when the new tenant had possession
Thenceforward the full sacks looped with the shining chain went scurrying up and down under the cathead hairy arms were thrust out from the different doorways and the grain was hauled in trusses of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns and the wimbles creaked while the scales and steelyards began to be busy where guesswork had formerly been the rule
32
Two bridges stood near the lower part of Casterbridge town
The first of weatherstained brick was immediately at the end of High Street where a diverging branch from that thoroughfare ran round to the lowlying Durnover lanes so that the precincts of the bridge formed the merging point of respectability and indigence
The second bridge of stone was further out on the highwayin fact fairly in the meadows though still within the town boundary
These bridges had speaking countenances
Every projection in each was worn down to obtuseness partly by weather more by friction from generations of loungers whose toes and heels had from year to year made restless movements against these parapets as they had stood there meditating on the aspect of affairs
In the case of the more friable bricks and stones even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the same mixed mechanism
The masonry of the top was clamped with iron at each joint since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench the coping off and throw it down the river in reckless defiance of the magistrates
For to this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town those who had failed in business in love in sobriety in crime
Why the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in preference to a railing a gate or a stile was not so clear
There was a marked difference of quality between the personages who haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far one of stone
Those of lowest character preferred the former adjoining the town they did not mind the glare of the public eye
They had been of comparatively no account during their successes and though they might feel dispirited they had no particular sense of shame in their ruin
Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets they wore a leather strap round their hips or knees and boots that required a great deal of lacing but seemed never to get any
Instead of sighing at their adversities they spat and instead of saying the iron had entered into their souls they said they were down on their luck
Jopp in his time of distress had often stood here so had Mother Cuxsom Christopher Coney and poor Abel Whittle
The miserables who would pause on the remoter bridge were of a politer stamp
They included bankrupts hypochondriacs persons who were what is called out of a situation from fault or lucklessness the inefficient of the professional classshabbygenteel men who did not know how to get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner and the yet more weary time between dinner and dark
The eye of this species were mostly directed over the parapet upon the running water below
A man seen there looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty sure to be one whom the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other
While one in straits on the townward bridge did not mind who saw him so and kept his back to the parapet to survey the passersby one in straits on this never faced the road never turned his head at coming footsteps but sensitive to his own condition watched the current whenever a stranger approached as if some strange fish interested him though every finned thing had been poached out of the river years before
There and thus they would muse if their grief were the grief of oppression they would wish themselves kings if their grief were poverty wish themselves millionaires if sin they would wish they were saints or angels if despised love that they were some muchcourted Adonis of county fame
Some had been known to stand and think so long with this fixed gaze downward that eventually they had allowed their poor carcases to follow that gaze and they were discovered the next morning out of reach of their troubles either here or in the deep pool called Blackwater a little higher up the river
To this bridge came Henchard as other unfortunates had come before him his way thither being by the riverside path on the chilly edge of the town
Here he was standing one windy afternoon when Durnover church clock struck five
While the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears across the damp intervening flat a man passed behind him and greeted Henchard by name
Henchard turned slightly and saw that the corner was Jopp his old foreman now employed elsewhere to whom though he hated him he had gone for lodgings because Jopp was the one man in Casterbridge whose observation and opinion the fallen cornmerchant despised to the point of indifference
Henchard returned him a scarcely perceptible nod and Jopp stopped
He and she are gone into their new house today said Jopp
Oh said Henchard absently
Which house is that
Your old one
Gone into my house
And starting up Henchard added  MY house of all others in the town
Well as somebody was sure to live there and you couldnt it can do ee no harm that hes the man
It was quite true he felt that it was doing him no harm
Farfrae who had already taken the yards and stores had acquired possession of the house for the obvious convenience of its contiguity
And yet this act of his taking up residence within those roomy chambers while he their former tenant lived in a cottage galled Henchard indescribably
Jopp continued And you heard of that fellow who bought all the best furniture at your sale
He was bidding for no other than Farfrae all the while
It has never been moved out of the house as hed already got the lease
My furniture too
Surely hell buy my body and soul likewise
Theres no saying he wont if you be willing to sell
And having planted these wounds in the heart of his once imperious master Jopp went on his way while Henchard stared and stared into the racing river till the bridge seemed moving backward with him
The low land grew blacker and the sky a deeper grey When the landscape looked like a picture blotted in with ink another traveller approached the great stone bridge
He was driving a gig his direction being also townwards
On the round of the middle of the arch the gig stopped
Mr Henchard
came from it in the voice of Farfrae
Henchard turned his face
Finding that he had guessed rightly Farfrae told the man who accompanied him to drive home while he alighted and went up to his former friend
I have heard that you think of emigrating Mr
Henchard
he said
Is it true
I have a real reason for asking
Henchard withheld his answer for several instants and then said Yes it is true
I am going where you were going to a few years ago when I prevented you and got you to bide here
Tis turn and turn about isnt it
Do ye mind how we stood like this in the Chalk Walk when I persuaded ee to stay
You then stood without a chattel to your name and I was the master of the house in corn Street
But now I stand without a stick or a rag and the master of that house is you
Yes yes thats so
Its the way o the warrld said Farfrae
Ha ha true
cried Henchard throwing himself into a mood of jocularity
Up and down
Im used to it
Whats the odds after all
Now listen to me if its no taking up your time said Farfrae just as I listened to you
Dont go
Stay at home
But I can do nothing else man
said Henchard scornfully
The little money I have will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks and no more
I have not felt inclined to go back to journeywork yet but I cant stay doing nothing and my best chance is elsewhere
No but what I propose is thisif ye will listen
Come and live in your old house
We can spare some rooms very wellI am sure my wife would not mind it at alluntil theres an opening for ye
Henchard started
Probably the picture drawn by the unsuspecting Donald of himself under the same roof with Lucetta was too striking to be received with equanimity
No no he said gruffly we should quarrel
You should hae a part to yourself said Farfrae and nobody to interfere wi you
It will be a deal healthier than down there by the river where you live now
Still Henchard refused
You dont know what you ask he said
However I can do no less than thank ee
They walked into the town together side by side as they had done when Henchard persuaded the young Scotchman to remain
Will you come in and have some supper
said Farfrae when they reached the middle of the town where their paths diverged right and left
No no
Bythebye I had nearly forgot
I bought a good deal of your furniture
So I have heard
Well it was no that I wanted it so very much for myself but I wish ye to pick out all that you care to havesuch things as may be endeared to ye by associations or particularly suited to your use
And take them to your own houseit will not be depriving me we can do with less very well and I will have plenty of opportunities of getting more
Whatgive it to me for nothing
said Henchard
But you paid the creditors for it
Ah yes but maybe its worth more to you than it is to me
Henchard was a little moved
Isometimes think Ive wronged ee
he said in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid in his face
He shook Farfrae abruptly by the hand and hastened away as if unwilling to betray himself further
Farfrae saw him turn through the thoroughfare into Bull Stake and vanish down towards the Priory Mill
Meanwhile ElizabethJane in an upper room no larger than the Prophets chamber and with the silk attire of her palmy days packed away in a box was netting with great industry between the hours which she devoted to studying such books as she could get hold of
Her lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfathers former residence now Farfraes she could see Donald and Lucetta speeding in and out of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation
She avoided looking that way as much as possible but it was hardly in human nature to keep the eyes averted when the door slammed
While living on thus quietly she heard the news that Henchard had caught cold and was confined to his room possibly a result of standing about the meads in damp weather
She went off to his house at once
This time she was determined not to be denied admittance and made her way upstairs
He was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him and at first resented her intrusion
Go away go away he said
I dont like to see ee
But father I dont like to see ee he repeated
However the ice was broken and she remained
She made the room more comfortable gave directions to the people below and by the time she went away had reconciled her stepfather to her visiting him
The effect either of her ministrations or of her mere presence was a rapid recovery
He soon was well enough to go out and now things seemed to wear a new colour in his eyes
He no longer thought of emigration and thought more of Elizabeth
The having nothing to do made him more dreary than any other circumstance and one day with better views of Farfrae than he had held for some time and a sense that honest work was not a thing to be ashamed of he stoically went down to Farfraes yard and asked to be taken on as a journeyman haytrusser
He was engaged at once
This hiring of Henchard was done through a foreman Farfrae feeling that it was undesirable to come personally in contact with the excornfactor more than was absolutely necessary
While anxious to help him he was well aware by this time of his uncertain temper and thought reserved relations best
For the same reason his orders to Henchard to proceed to this and that country farm trussing in the usual way were always given through a third person
For a time these arrangements worked well it being the custom to truss in the respective stackyards before bringing it away the hay bought at the different farms about the neighbourhood so that Henchard was often absent at such places the whole week long
When this was all done and Henchard had become in a measure broken in he came to work daily on the home premises like the rest
And thus the once flourishing merchant and Mayor and what not stood as a daylabourer in the barns and granaries he formerly had owned
I have worked as a journeyman before now hant I
he would say in his defiant way and why shouldnt I do it again
But he looked a far different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days
Then he had worn clean suitable clothes light and cheerful in hue leggings yellow as marigolds corduroys immaculate as new flax and a neckerchief like a flowergarden
Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times a rusty silk hat and a once black satin stock soiled and shabby
Clad thus he went to and fro still comparatively an active manfor he was not much over fortyand saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden and the big house and Lucetta
At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr Farfrae already in the Town Council was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two
Yes she was wise she was wise in her generation
said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfraes haybarn
He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of hisof Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode roughshod over him
A fellow of his age going to be Mayor indeed
he murmured with a cornerdrawn smile on his mouth
But tis her money that floats en upward
Hahahow cust odd it is
Here be I his former master working for him as man and he the man standing as master with my house and my furniture and my whatyoumaycall wife all his own
He repeated these things a hundred times a day
During the whole period of his acquaintance with Lucetta he had never wished to claim her as his own so desperately as he now regretted her loss
It was no mercenary hankering after her fortune that moved him though that fortune had been the means of making her so much the more desired by giving her the air of independence and sauciness which attracts men of his composition
It had given her servants house and fine clothinga setting that invested Lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of him who had known her in her narrow days
He accordingly lapsed into moodiness and at every allusion to the possibility of Farfraes near election to the municipal chair his former hatred of the Scotchman returned
Concurrently with this he underwent a moral change
It resulted in his significantly saying every now and then in tones of recklessness Only a fortnight more
Only a dozen days
and so forth lessening his figures day by day
Why dye say only a dozen days
asked Solomon Longways as he worked beside Henchard in the granary weighing oats
Because in twelve days I shall be released from my oath
What oath
The oath to drink no spirituous liquid
In twelve days it will be twentyone years since I swore it and then I mean to enjoy myself please God
ElizabethJane sat at her window one Sunday and while there she heard in the street below a conversation which introduced Henchards name
She was wondering what was the matter when a third person who was passing by asked the question in her mind
Michael Henchard have busted out drinking after taking nothing for twentyone years
ElizabethJane jumped up put on her things and went out
33
At this date there prevailed in Casterbridge a convivial customscarcely recognized as such yet none the less established
On the afternoon of every Sunday a large contingent of the Casterbridge journeymensteady church goers and sedate charactershaving attended service filed from the church doors across the way to the Three Mariners Inn
The rear was usually brought up by the choir with their bassviols fiddles and flutes under their arms
The great point the point of honour on these sacred occasions was for each man to strictly limit himself to halfapint of liquor
This scrupulosity was so well understood by the landlord that the whole company was served in cups of that measure
They were all exactly alike straightsided with two leafless limetrees done in eel brown on the sidesone towards the drinkers lips the other confronting his comrade
To wonder how many of these cups the landlord possessed altogether was a favourite exercise of children in the marvellous
Forty at least might have been seen at these times in the large room forming a ring round the margin of the great sixteenlegged oak table like the monolithic circle of Stonehenge in its pristine days
Outside and above the forty cups came a circle of forty smokejets from forty clay pipes outside the pipes the countenances of the forty churchgoers supported at the back by a circle of forty chairs
The conversation was not the conversation of weekdays but a thing altogether finer in point and higher in tone
They invariably discussed the sermon dissecting it weighing it as above or below the averagethe general tendency being to regard it as a scientific feat or performance which had no relation to their own lives except as between critics and the thing criticized
The bassviol player and the clerk usually spoke with more authority than the rest on account of their official connection with the preacher
Now the Three Mariners was the inn chosen by Henchard as the place for closing his long term of dramless years
He had so timed his entry as to be well established in the large room by the time the forty churchgoers entered to their customary cups
The flush upon his face proclaimed at once that the vow of twentyone years had lapsed and the era of recklessness begun anew
He was seated on a small table drawn up to the side of the massive oak board reserved for the churchmen a few of whom nodded to him as they took their places and said How be ye Mr Henchard
Quite a stranger here
Henchard did not take the trouble to reply for a few moments and his eyes rested on his stretchedout legs and boots
Yes he said at length thats true
Ive been down in spirit for weeks some of ye know the cause
I am better now but not quite serene
I want you fellows of the choir to strike up a tune and what with that and this brew of Stannidges I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor key
With all my heart said the first fiddle
Weve let back our strings thats true but we can soon pull em up again
Sound A neighbours and give the man a stave
I dont care a curse what the words be said Henchard
Hymns ballets or rantipole rubbish the Rogues March or the cherubims warbletis all the same to me if tis good harmony and well put out
Wellheh hehit may be we can do that and not a man among us that have sat in the gallery less than twenty year said the leader of the band
As tis Sunday neighbours suppose we raise the Fourth Psaam to Samuel Wakelys tune as improved by me
Hang Samuel Wakelys tune as improved by thee
said Henchard
Chuck across one of your psaltersold Wiltshire is the only tune worth singingthe psalmtune that would make my blood ebb and flow like the sea when I was a steady chap
Ill find some words to fit en
He took one of the psalters and began turning over the leaves
Chancing to look out of the window at that moment he saw a flock of people passing by and perceived them to be the congregation of the upper church now just dismissed their sermon having been a longer one than that the lower parish was favoured with
Among the rest of the leading inhabitants walked Mr Councillor Farfrae with Lucetta upon his arm the observed and imitated of all the smaller tradesmens womankind
Henchards mouth changed a little and he continued to turn over the leaves
Now then he said Psalm the HundredandNinth to the tune of Wiltshire verses ten to fifteen
I gie ye the words His seed shall orphans be his wife A widow plunged in grief His vagrant children beg their bread Where none can give relief
His illgot riches shall be made To usurers a prey The fruit of all his toil shall be By strangers borne away
None shall be found that to his wants Their mercy will extend Or to his helpless orphan seed The least assistance lend
A swift destruction soon shall seize On his unhappy race And the next age his hated name Shall utterly deface
I know the PsaamI know the Psaam
said the leader hastily but I would as lief not sing it
Twasnt made for singing
We chose it once when the gipsy stole the pasons mare thinking to please him but pason were quite upset
Whatever Servant David were thinking about when he made a Psalm that nobody can sing without disgracing himself I cant fathom
Now then the Fourth Psalm to Samuel Wakelys tune as improved by me
Od seize your sauceI tell ye to sing the Hundredand Ninth to Wiltshire and sing it you shall
roared Henchard
Not a single one of all the droning crew of ye goes out of this room till that Psalm is sung
He slipped off the table seized the poker and going to the door placed his back against it
Now then go ahead if you dont wish to have your cust pates broke
Dont ee dontee take on soAs tis the Sabbathday and tis Servant Davids words and not ours perhaps we dont mind for once hey
said one of the terrified choir looking round upon the rest
So the instruments were tuned and the comminatory verses sung
Thank ye thank ye said Henchard in a softened voice his eyes growing downcast and his manner that of a man much moved by the strains
Dont you blame David he went on in low tones shaking his head without raising his eyes
He knew what he was about when he wrote thatIf I could afford it be hanged if I wouldnt keep a church choir at my own expense to play and sing to me at these low dark times of my life
But the bitter thing is that when I was rich I didnt need what I could have and now I be poor I cant have what I need
While they paused Lucetta and Farfrae passed again this time homeward it being their custom to take like others a short walk out on the highway and back between church and teatime
Theres the man weve been singing about said Henchard
The players and singers turned their heads and saw his meaning
Heaven forbid
said the bassplayer
Tis the man repeated Henchard doggedly
Then if Id known said the performer on the clarionet solemnly that twas meant for a living man nothing should have drawn out of my wyndpipe the breath for that Psalm so help me
Nor from mine said the first singer
But thought I as it was made so long ago perhaps there isnt much in it so Ill oblige a neighbour for theres nothing to be said against the tune
Ah my boys youve sung it said Henchard triumphantly
As for him it was partly by his songs that he got over me and heaved me outI could double him up like thatand yet I dont
He laid the poker across his knee bent it as if it were a twig flung it down and came away from the door
It was at this time that ElizabethJane having heard where her stepfather was entered the room with a pale and agonized countenance
The choir and the rest of the company moved off in accordance with their halfpint regulation
ElizabethJane went up to Henchard and entreated him to accompany her home
By this hour the volcanic fires of his nature had burnt down and having drunk no great quantity as yet he was inclined to acquiesce
She took his arm and together they went on
Henchard walked blankly like a blind man repeating to himself the last words of the singers And the next age his hated name Shall utterly deface
At length he said to her I am a man to my word
I have kept my oath for twentyone years and now I can drink with a good conscienceIf I dont do for himwell I am a fearful practical joker when I choose
He has taken away everything from me and by heavens if I meet him I wont answer for my deeds
These halfuttered words alarmed Elizabethall the more by reason of the still determination of Henchards mien
What will you do
she asked cautiously while trembling with disquietude and guessing Henchards allusion only too well
Henchard did not answer and they went on till they had reached his cottage
May I come in
she said
No no not today said Henchard and she went away feeling that to caution Farfrae was almost her duty as it was certainly her strong desire
As on the Sunday so on the weekdays Farfrae and Lucetta might have been seen flitting about the town like two butterfliesor rather like a bee and a butterfly in league for life
She seemed to take no pleasure in going anywhere except in her husbands company and hence when business would not permit him to waste an afternoon she remained indoors waiting for the time to pass till his return her face being visible to ElizabethJane from her window aloft
The latter however did not say to herself that Farfrae should be thankful for such devotion but full of her reading she cited Rosalinds exclamation Mistress know yourself down on your knees and thank Heaven fasting for a good mans love
She kept her eye upon Henchard also
One day he answered her inquiry for his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittles pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard
He is such a fool said Henchard that he can never get out of his mind the time when I was master there
Ill come and wimble for you instead of him if you will allow me said she
Her motive on going to the yard was to get an opportunity of observing the general position of affairs on Farfraes premises now that her stepfather was a workman there
Henchards threats had alarmed her so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face to face
For two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any appearance
Then one afternoon the green door opened and through came first Farfrae and at his heels Lucetta
Donald brought his wife forward without hesitation it being obvious that he had no suspicion whatever of any antecedents in common between her and the now journeyman haytrusser
Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair keeping them fixed on the bond he twisted as if that alone absorbed him
A feeling of delicacy which ever prompted Farfrae to avoid anything that might seem like triumphing over a fallen rivel led him to keep away from the haybarn where Henchard and his daughter were working and to go on to the corn department
Meanwhile Lucetta never having been informed that Henchard had entered her husbands service rambled straight on to the barn where she came suddenly upon Henchard and gave vent to a little Oh
which the happy and busy Donald was too far off to hear
Henchard with withering humility of demeanour touched the brim of his hat to her as Whittle and the rest had done to which she breathed a deadalive Good afternoon
I beg your pardon maam
said Henchard as if he had not heard
I said good afternoon she faltered
O yes good afternoon maam he replied touching his hat again
I am glad to see you maam
Lucetta looked embarrassed and Henchard continued For we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a lady should look in and take an interest in us
She glanced at him entreatingly the sarcasm was too bitter too unendurable
Can you tell me the time maam
he asked
Yes she said hastily halfpast four
Thank ee
An hour and a half longer before we are released from work
Ah maam we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that such as you enjoy
As soon as she could do so Lucetta left him nodded and smiled to ElizabethJane and joined her husband at the other end of the enclosure where she could be seen leading him away by the outer gates so as to avoid passing Henchard again
That she had been taken by surprise was obvious
The result of this casual rencounter was that the next morning a note was put into Henchards hand by the postman
Will you said Lucetta with as much bitterness as she could put into a small communication will you kindly undertake not to speak to me in the biting undertones you used today if I walk through the yard at any time
I bear you no illwill and I am only too glad that you should have employment of my dear husband but in common fairness treat me as his wife and do not try to make me wretched by covert sneers
I have committed no crime and done you no injury
Poor fool
said Henchard with fond savagery holding out the note
To know no better than commit herself in writing like this
Why if I were to show that to her dear husband pooh
He threw the letter into the fire
Lucetta took care not to come again among the hay and corn
She would rather have died than run the risk of encountering Henchard at such close quarters a second time
The gulf between them was growing wider every day
Farfrae was always considerate to his fallen acquaintance but it was impossible that he should not by degrees cease to regard the excornmerchant as more than one of his other workmen
Henchard saw this and concealed his feelings under a cover of stolidity fortifying his heart by drinking more freely at the Three Mariners every evening
Often did ElizabethJane in her endeavours to prevent his taking other liquor carry tea to him in a little basket at five oclock
Arriving one day on this errand she found her stepfather was measuring up cloverseed and rapeseed in the cornstores on the top floor and she ascended to him
Each floor had a door opening into the air under a cathead from which a chain dangled for hoisting the sacks
When Elizabeths head rose through the trap she perceived that the upper door was open and that her stepfather and Farfrae stood just within it in conversation Farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge and Henchard a little way behind
Not to interrupt them she remained on the steps without raising her head any higher
While waiting thus she sawor fancied she saw for she had a terror of feeling certain her stepfather slowly raise his hand to a level behind Farfraes shoulders a curious expression taking possession of his face
The young man was quite unconscious of the action which was so indirect that if Farfrae had observed it he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching of the arm
But it would have been possible by a comparatively light touch to push Farfrae off his balance and send him head over heels into the air
Elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this MIGHT have meant
As soon as they turned she mechanically took the tea to Henchard left it and went away
Reflecting she endeavoured to assure herself that the movement was an idle eccentricity and no more
Yet on the other hand his subordinate position in an establishment where he once had been master might be acting on him like an irritant poison and she finally resolved to caution Donald
34
Next morning accordingly she rose at five oclock and went into the street
It was not yet light a dense fog prevailed and the town was as silent as it was dark except that from the rectangular avenues which framed in the borough there came a chorus of tiny rappings caused by the fall of waterdrops condensed on the boughs now it was wafted from the West Walk now from the South Walk and then from both quarters simultaneously
She moved on to the bottom of corn Street and knowing his time well waited only a few minutes before she heard the familiar bang of his door and then his quick walk towards her
She met him at the point where the last tree of the engirding avenue flanked the last house in the street
He could hardly discern her till glancing inquiringly he said WhatMiss Henchardand are ye up so airly
She asked him to pardon her for waylaying him at such an unseemly time
But I am anxious to mention something she said
And I wished not to alarm Mrs Farfrae by calling
Yes
said he with the cheeriness of a superior
And what may it be
Its very kind of ye Im sure
She now felt the difficulty of conveying to his mind the exact aspect of possibilities in her own
But she somehow began and introduced Henchards name
I sometimes fear she said with an effort that he may be betrayed into some attempt toinsult you sir
But we are the best of friends
Or to play some practical joke upon you sir
Remember that he has been hardly used
But we are quite friendly
Or to do somethingthat would injure youhurt youwound you
Every word cost her twice its length of pain
And she could see that Farfrae was still incredulous
Henchard a poor man in his employ was not to Farfraes view the Henchard who had ruled him
Yet he was not only the same man but that man with his sinister qualities formerly latent quickened into life by his buffetings
Farfrae happy and thinking no evil persisted in making light of her fears
Thus they parted and she went homeward journeymen now being in the street waggoners going to the harnessmakers for articles left to be repaired farmhorses going to the shoeingsmiths and the sons of labour showing themselves generally on the move
Elizabeth entered her lodging unhappily thinking she had done no good and only made herself appear foolish by her weak note of warning
But Donald Farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never absolutely lost
He revised impressions from a subsequent point of view and the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his permanent one
The vision of Elizabeths earnest face in the rimy dawn came back to him several times during the day
Knowing the solidity of her character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds
But he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchards account that engaged him just then and when he met Lawyer Joyce the townclerk later in the day he spoke of it as if nothing had occurred to damp it
About that little seedsmans shop he said the shop overlooking the churchyard which is to let
It is not for myself I want it but for our unlucky fellowtownsman Henchard
It would be a new beginning for him if a small one and I have told the Council that I would head a private subscription among them to set him up in itthat I would be fifty pounds if they would make up the other fifty among them
Yes yes so Ive heard and theres nothing to say against it for that matter the townclerk replied in his plain frank way
But Farfrae others see what you dont
Henchard hates eeay hates ee and tis right that you should know it
To my knowledge he was at the Three Mariners last night saying in public that about you which a man ought not to say about another
Is that soah is that so
said Farfrae looking down
Why should he do it
added the young man bitterly what harm have I done him that he should try to wrong me
God only knows said Joyce lifting his eyebrows
It shows much longsuffering in you to put up with him and keep him in your employ
But I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me
How can I forget that when I came here twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel
No no
As long as Ive a days work to offer he shall do it if he chooses
Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that
But Ill drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about it
It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme
But a damp having been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air he went and countermanded his orders
The then occupier of the shop was in it when Farfrae spoke to him and feeling it necessary to give some explanation of his withdrawal from the negotiation Donald mentioned Henchards name and stated that the intentions of the Council had been changed
The occupier was much disappointed and straightway informed Henchard as soon as he saw him that a scheme of the Council for setting him up in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae
And thus out of error enmity grew
When Farfrae got indoors that evening the teakettle was singing on the high hob of the semieggshaped grate
Lucetta light as a sylph ran forward and seized his hands whereupon Farfrae duly kissed her
Oh
she cried playfully turning to the window
Seethe blinds are not drawn down and the people can look inwhat a scandal
When the candles were lighted the curtains drawn and the twain sat at tea she noticed that he looked serious
Without directly inquiring why she let her eyes linger solicitously on his face
Who has called
he absently asked
Any folk for me
No said Lucetta
Whats the matter Donald
Wellnothing worth talking of he responded sadly
Then never mind it
You will get through it Scotchmen are always lucky
Nonot always
he said shaking his head gloomily as he contemplated a crumb on the table
I know many who have not been so
There was Sandy Macfarlane who started to America to try his fortune and he was drowned and Archibald Leith he was murdered
And poor Willie Dunbleeze and Maitland Macfreezethey fell into bad courses and went the way of all such
Whyyou old gooseyI was only speaking in a general sense of course
You are always so literal
Now when we have finished tea sing me that funny song about highheeled shoon and siller tags and the oneandforty wooers
No no
I couldna sing tonight
Its Henchardhe hates me so that I may not be his friend if I would
I would understand why there should be a wee bit of envy but I cannet see a reason for the whole intensity of what he feels
Now can you Lucetta
It is more like oldfashioned rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade
Lucetta had grown somewhat wan
No she replied
I give him employmentI cannet refuse it
But neither can I blind myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his there is no safeguard for conduct
What have you heardO Donald dearest
said Lucetta in alarm
The words on her lips were anything about me
but she did not utter them
She could not however suppress her agitation and her eyes filled with tears
No noit is not so serious as ye fancy declared Farfrae soothingly though he did not know its seriousness so well as she
I wish you would do what we have talked of mournfully remarked Lucetta
Give up business and go away from here
We have plenty of money and why should we stay
Farfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move and they talked thereon till a visitor was announced
Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came in
Youve heard I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfields death
Yesdied this afternoon at five said Mr Vatt Chalkfield was the Councilman who had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November
Farfrae was sorry at the intelligence and Mr Vatt continued Well we know hes been going some days and as his family is well provided for we must take it all as it is
Now I have called to ask ee thisquite privately
If I should nominate ee to succeed him and there should be no particular opposition will ee accept the chair
But there are folk whose turn is before mine and Im over young and may be thought pushing
said Farfrae after a pause
Not at all
I dont speak for myself only several have named it
You wont refuse
We thought of going away interposed Lucetta looking at Farfrae anxiously
It was only a fancy Farfrae murmured
I wouldna refuse if it is the wish of a respectable majority in the Council
Very well then look upon yourself as elected
We have had older men long enough
When he was gone Farfrae said musingly See now how its ourselves that are ruled by the Powers above us
We plan this but we do that
If they want to make me Mayor I will stay and Henchard must rave as he will
From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy
If she had not been imprudence incarnate she would not have acted as she did when she met Henchard by accident a day or two later
It was in the bustle of the market when no one could readily notice their discourse
Michael said she I must again ask you what I asked you months agoto return me any letters or papers of mine that you may haveunless you have destroyed them
You must see how desirable it is that the time at Jersey should be blotted out for the good of all parties
Why bless the womanI packed up every scrap of your handwriting to give you in the coachbut you never appeared
She explained how the death of her aunt had prevented her taking the journey on that day
And what became of the parcel then
she asked
He could not sayhe would consider
When she was gone he recollected that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former diningroom safebuilt up in the wall of his old housenow occupied by Farfrae
The letters might have been amongst them
A grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchards face
Had that safe been opened
On the very evening which followed this there was a great ringing of bells in Casterbridge and the combined brass wood catgut and leather bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussionnotes than ever
Farfrae was Mayorthe twohundredth odd of a series forming an elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles Iand the fair Lucetta was the courted of the townBut Ah
the worm i the budHenchard what he could tell
He in the meantime festering with indignation at some erroneous intelligence of Farfraes opposition to the scheme for installing him in the little seedshop was greeted with the news of the municipal election which by reason of Farfraes comparative youth and his Scottish nativitya thing unprecedented in the casehad an interest far beyond the ordinary
The bellringing and the bandplaying loud as Tamerlanes trumpet goaded the downfallen Henchard indescribably the ousting now seemed to him to be complete
The next morning he went to the cornyard as usual and about eleven oclock Donald entered through the green door with no trace of the worshipful about him
The yet more emphatic change of places between him and Henchard which this election had established renewed a slight embarrassment in the manner of the modest young man but Henchard showed the front of one who had overlooked all this and Farfrae met his amenities halfway at once
I was going to ask you said Henchard about a packet that I may possibly have left in my old safe in the dining room
He added particulars
If so it is there now said Farfrae
I have never opened the safe at all as yet for I keep ma papers at the bank to sleep easy o nights
It was not of much consequenceto me said Henchard
But Ill call for it this evening if you dont mind
It was quite late when he fulfilled his promise
He had primed himself with grog as he did very frequently now and a curl of sardonic humour hung on his lip as he approached the house as though he were contemplating some terrible form of amusement
Whatever it was the incident of his entry did not diminish its force this being his first visit to the house since he had lived there as owner
The ring of the bell spoke to him like the voice of a familiar drudge who had been bribed to forsake him the movements of the doors were revivals of dead days
Farfrae invited him into the diningroom where he at once unlocked the iron safe built into the wall HIS Henchards safe made by an ingenious locksmith under his direction
Farfrae drew thence the parcel and other papers with apologies for not having returned them
Never mind said Henchard drily
The fact is they are letters mostlyYes he went on sitting down and unfolding Lucettas passionate bundle here they be
That ever I should see em again
I hope Mrs Farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday
She has felt a bit weary and has gone to bed airly on that account
Henchard returned to the letters sorting them over with interest Farfrae being seated at the other end of the diningtable
You dont forget of course he resumed that curious chapter in the history of my past which I told you of and that you gave me some assistance in
These letters are in fact related to that unhappy business
Though thank God it is all over now
What became of the poor woman
asked Farfrae
Luckily she married and married well said Henchard
So that these reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges as they might otherwise have doneJust listen to what an angry woman will say
Farfrae willing to humour Henchard though quite uninterested and bursting with yawns gave wellmannered attention
For me Henchard read there is practically no future
A creature too unconventionally devoted to youwho feels it impossible that she can be the wife of any other man and who is yet no more to you than the first woman you meet in the streetsuch am I I quite acquit you of any intention to wrong me yet you are the door through which wrong has come to me
That in the event of your present wifes death you will place me in her position is a consolation so far as it goesbut how far does it go
Thus I sit here forsaken by my few acquaintance and forsaken by you
Thats how she went on to me said Henchard acres of words like that when what had happened was what I could not cure
Yes said Farfrae absently it is the way wi women
But the fact was that he knew very little of the sex yet detecting a sort of resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped and those of the supposed stranger he concluded that Aphrodite ever spoke thus whosesoever the personality she assumed
Henchard unfolded another letter and read it through likewise stopping at the subscription as before
Her name I dont give he said blandly
As I didnt marry her and another man did I can scarcely do that in fairness to her
Trrue trrue said Farfrae
But why didnt you marry her when your wife Susan died
Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned
Ahwell you may ask that
said Henchard the newmoon shaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth
In spite of all her protestations when I came forward to do so as in generosity bound she was not the woman for me
She had already married anothermaybe
Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars and he answered Yes
The young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily
She had she had said Henchard emphatically
He opened a third and fourth letter and read
This time he approached the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest
But again he stopped short
The truth was that as may be divined he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading out the name he had come to the house with no other thought
But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it
Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him
His quality was such that he could have annihilated them both in the heat of action but to accomplish the deed by oral poison was beyond the nerve of his enmity
35
As Donald stated Lucetta had retired early to her room because of fatigue
She had however not gone to rest but sat in the bedside chair reading and thinking over the events of the day
At the ringing of the doorbell by Henchard she wondered who it should be that would call at that comparatively late hour
The diningroom was almost under her bedroom she could hear that somebody was admitted there and presently the indistinct murmur of a person reading became audible
The usual time for Donalds arrival upstairs came and passed yet still the reading and conversation went on
This was very singular
She could think of nothing but that some extraordinary crime had been committed and that the visitor whoever he might be was reading an account of it from a special edition of the Casterbridge Chronicle
At last she left the room and descended the stairs
The diningroom door was ajar and in the silence of the resting household the voice and the words were recognizable before she reached the lower flight
She stood transfixed
Her own words greeted her in Henchards voice like spirits from the grave
Lucetta leant upon the banister with her cheek against the smooth handrail as if she would make a friend of it in her misery
Rigid in this position more and more words fell successively upon her ear
But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband
He spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time
One word he was saying as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet
Is it quite fair to this young womans memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone
Well yes said Henchard
By not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind and not a scandal to one
If I were you I would destroy them said Farfrae giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done
As another mans wife it would injure the woman if it were known
No I shall not destroy them murmured Henchard putting the letters away
Then he arose and Lucetta heard no more
She went back to her bedroom in a semiparalyzed state
For very fear she could not undress but sat on the edge of the bed waiting
Would Henchard let out the secret in his parting words
Her suspense was terrible
Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it and married her just the sameunlikely as it had once seemed but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal
The door slammed she could hear her husband bolting it
After looking round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs
The spark in her eyes wellnigh went out when he appeared round the bedroom door
Her gaze hung doubtful for a moment then to her joyous amazement she saw that he looked at her with the rallying smile of one who had just been relieved of a scene that was irksome
She could hold out no longer and sobbed hysterically
When he had restored her Farfrae naturally enough spoke of Henchard
Of all men he was the least desirable as a visitor he said but it is my belief that hes just a bit crazed
He has been reading to me a long lot of letters relating to his past life and I could do no less than indulge him by listening
This was sufficient
Henchard then had not told
Henchards last words to Farfrae in short as he stood on the doorstep had been these WellIm obliged to ee for listening
I may tell more about her some day
Finding this she was much perplexed as to Henchards motives in opening the matter at all for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a power of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our friends and forget that abortive efforts from want of heart are as possible to revenge as to generosity
Next morning Lucetta remained in bed meditating how to parry this incipient attack
The bold stroke of telling Donald the truth dimly conceived was yet too bold for she dreaded lest in doing so he like the rest of the world should believe that the episode was rather her fault than her misfortune
She decided to employ persuasionnot with Donald but with the enemy himself
It seemed the only practicable weapon left her as a woman
Having laid her plan she rose and wrote to him who kept her on these tenterhooks I overheard your interview with my husband last night and saw the drift of your revenge
The very thought of it crushes me
Have pity on a distressed woman
If you could see me you would relent
You do not know how anxiety has told upon me lately
I will be at the Ring at the time you leave workjust before the sun goes down
Please come that way
I cannot rest till I have seen you face to face and heard from your mouth that you will carry this horseplay no further
To herself she said on closing up her appeal If ever tears and pleadings have served the weak to fight the strong let them do so now
With this view she made a toilette which differed from all she had ever attempted before
To heighten her natural attraction had hitherto been the unvarying endeavour of her adult life and one in which she was no novice
But now she neglected this and even proceeded to impair the natural presentation
Beyond a natural reason for her slightly drawn look she had not slept all the previous night and this had produced upon her pretty though slightly worn features the aspect of a countenance ageing prematurely from extreme sorrow
She selectedas much from want of spirit as designher poorest plainest and longest discarded attire
To avoid the contingency of being recognized she veiled herself and slipped out of the house quickly
The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid by the time she had got up the road opposite the amphitheatre which she speedily entered
The interior was shadowy and emphatic of the absence of every living thing
She was not disappointed in the fearful hope with which she awaited him
Henchard came over the top descended and Lucetta waited breathlessly
But having reached the arena she saw a change in his bearing he stood still at a little distance from her she could not think why
Nor could any one else have known
The truth was that in appointing this spot and this hour for the rendezvous Lucetta had unwittingly backed up her entreaty by the strongest argument she could have used outside words with this man of moods glooms and superstitions
Her figure in the midst of the huge enclosure the unusual plainness of her dress her attitude of hope and appeal so strongly revived in his soul the memory of another illused woman who had stood there and thus in bygone days and had now passed away into her rest that he was unmanned and his heart smote him for having attempted reprisals on one of a sex so weak
When he approached her and before she had spoken a word her point was half gained
His manner as he had come down had been one of cynical carelessness but he now put away his grim halfsmile and said in a kindly subdued tone Goodnight tye
Of course I in glad to come if you want me
O thank you she said apprehensively
I am sorry to see ee looking so ill he stammered with unconcealed compunction
She shook her head
How can you be sorry she asked when you deliberately cause it
What
said Henchard uneasily
Is it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that
It is all your doing she said
I have no other grief
My happiness would be secure enough but for your threats
O Michael
dont wreck me like this
You might think that you have done enough
When I came here I was a young woman now I am rapidly becoming an old one
Neither my husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long
Henchard was disarmed
His old feeling of supercilious pity for womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here as the double of the first
Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk
Such a woman was very small deer to hunt he felt ashamed lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain
He had married money but nothing more
Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game
Well what do you want me to do
he said gently
I am sure I shall be very willing
My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke and I revealed nothing
To give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse
So be it
Every scrap shall be yoursBut between you and me Lucetta he is sure to find out something of the matter sooner or later
Ah
she said with eager tremulousness but not till I have proved myself a faithful and deserving wife to him and then he may forgive me everything
Henchard silently looked at her he almost envied Farfrae such love as that even now
HmI hope so he said
But you shall have the letters without fail
And your secret shall be kept
I swear it
How good you arehow shall I get them
He reflected and said he would send them the next morning
Now dont doubt me he added
I can keep my word
36
Returning from her appointment Lucetta saw a man waiting by the lamp nearest to her own door
When she stopped to go in he came and spoke to her
It was Jopp
He begged her pardon for addressing her
But he had heard that Mr Farfrae had been applied to by a neighbouring corn merchant to recommend a working partner if so he wished to offer himself
He could give good security and had stated as much to Mr Farfrae in a letter but he would feel much obliged if Lucetta would say a word in his favour to her husband
It is a thing I know nothing about said Lucetta coldly
But you can testify to my trustworthiness better than anybody maam said Jopp
I was in Jersey several years and knew you there by sight
Indeed she replied
But I knew nothing of you
I think maam that a word or two from you would secure for me what I covet very much he persisted
She steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair and cutting him short because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her left him on the pavement
He watched her till she had vanished and then went home
When he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle
A movement upstairs disturbed him and Henchard came down from his bedroom where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes
I wish said Henchard you would do me a service Jopp nowtonight I mean if you can
Leave this at Mrs Farfraes for her
I should take it myself of course but I dont wish to be seen there
He handed a package in brown paper sealed
Henchard had been as good as his word
Immediately on coming indoors he had searched over his few belongings and every scrap of Lucettas writing that he possessed was here
Jopp indifferently expressed his willingness
Well how have ye got on today
his lodger asked
Any prospect of an opening
I am afraid not said Jopp who had not told the other of his application to Farfrae
There never will be in Casterbridge declared Henchard decisively
You must roam further afield
He said good night to Jopp and returned to his own part of the house
Jopp sat on till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the candlesnuff on the wall and looking at the original he found that it had formed itself into a head like a redhot cauliflower
Henchards packet next met his gaze
He knew there had been something of the nature of wooing between Henchard and the now Mrs Farfrae and his vague ideas on the subject narrowed themselves down to these Henchard had a parcel belonging to Mrs Farfrae and he had reasons for not returning that parcel to her in person
What could be inside it
So he went on and on till animated by resentment at Lucettas haughtiness as he thought it and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides to this transaction with Henchard he examined the package
The pen and all its relations being awkward tools in Henchards hands he had affixed the seals without an impression it never occurring to him that the efficacy of such a fastening depended on this
Jopp was far less of a tyro he lifted one of the seals with his penknife peeped in at the end thus opened saw that the bundle consisted of letters and having satisfied himself thus far sealed up the end again by simply softening the wax with the candle and went off with the parcel as requested
His path was by the riverside at the foot of the town
Coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld lounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge
We be just going down Mixen Lane way to look into Peters finger afore creeping to bed said Mrs Cuxsom
Theres a fiddle and tambourine going on there
Lord whats all the worlddo ye come along too Jopptwont hinder ye five minutes
Jopp had mostly kept himself out of this company but present circumstances made him somewhat more reckless than usual and without many words he decided to go to his destination that way
Though the upper part of Durnover was mainly composed of a curious congeries of barns and farmsteads there was a less picturesque side to the parish
This was Mixen Lane now in great part pulled down
Mixen Lane was the Adullam of all the surrounding villages
It was the hidingplace of those who were in distress and in debt and trouble of every kind
Farmlabourers and other peasants who combined a little poaching with their farming and a little brawling and bibbing with their poaching found themselves sooner or later in Mixen Lane
Rural mechanics too idle to mechanize rural servants too rebellious to serve drifted or were forced into Mixen Lane
The lane and its surrounding thicket of thatched cottages stretched out like a spit into the moist and misty lowland
Much that was sad much that was low some things that were baneful could be seen in Mixen Lane
Vice ran freely in and out certain of the doors in the neighbourhood recklessness dwelt under the roof with the crooked chimney shame in some bowwindows theft in times of privation in the thatched and mudwalled houses by the sallows
Even slaughter had not been altogether unknown here
In a block of cottages up an alley there might have been erected an altar to disease in years gone by
Such was Mixen Lane in the times when Henchard and Farfrae were Mayors
Yet this mildewed leaf in the sturdy and flourishing Casterbridge plant lay close to the open country not a hundred yards from a row of noble elms and commanding a view across the moor of airy uplands and cornfields and mansions of the great
A brook divided the moor from the tenements and to outward view there was no way across it no way to the houses but round about by the road
But under every householders stairs there was kept a mysterious plank nine inches wide which plank was a secret bridge
If you as one of those refugee householders came in from business after darkand this was the business time here you stealthily crossed the moor approached the border of the aforesaid brook and whistled opposite the house to which you belonged
A shape thereupon made its appearance on the other side bearing the bridge on end against the sky it was lowered you crossed and a hand helped you to land yourself together with the pheasants and hares gathered from neighbouring manors
You sold them slily the next morning and the day after you stood before the magistrates with the eyes of all your sympathizing neighbours concentrated on your back
You disappeared for a time then you were again found quietly living in Mixen Lane
Walking along the lane at dusk the stranger was struck by two or three peculiar features therein
One was an intermittent rumbling from the back premises of the inn halfway up this meant a skittle alley
Another was the extensive prevalence of whistling in the various domicilesa piped note of some kind coming from nearly every open door
Another was the frequency of white aprons over dingy gowns among the women around the doorways
A white apron is a suspicious vesture in situations where spotlessness is difficult moreover the industry and cleanliness which the white apron expressed were belied by the postures and gaits of the women who wore ittheir knuckles being mostly on their hips an attitude which lent them the aspect of twohandled mugs and their shoulders against doorposts while there was a curious alacrity in the turn of each honest womans head upon her neck and in the twirl of her honest eyes at any noise resembling a masculine footfall along the lane
Yet amid so much that was bad needy respectability also found a home
Under some of the roofs abode pure and virtuous souls whose presence there was due to the iron hand of necessity and to that alone
Families from decayed villagesfamilies of that once bulky but now nearly extinct section of village society called liviers or lifeholderscopyholders and others whose rooftrees had fallen for some reason or other compelling them to quit the rural spot that had been their home for generationscame here unless they chose to lie under a hedge by the wayside
The inn called Peters finger was the church of Mixen Lane
It was centrally situate as such places should be and bore about the same social relation to the Three Mariners as the latter bore to the Kings Arms
At first sight the inn was so respectable as to be puzzling
The front door was kept shut and the step was so clean that evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface
But at the corner of the publichouse was an alley a mere slit dividing it from the next building
Halfway up the alley was a narrow door shiny and paintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders
This was the actual entrance to the inn
A pedestrian would be seen abstractedly passing along Mixen Lane and then in a moment he would vanish causing the gazer to blink like Ashton at the disappearance of Ravenswood
That abstracted pedestrian had edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways from the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill
The company at the Three Mariners were persons of quality in comparison with the company which gathered here though it must be admitted that the lowest fringe of the Mariners party touched the crest of Peters at points
Waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here
The landlady was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as an accessory to something or other after the fact
She underwent her twelvemonth and had worn a martyrs countenance ever since except at times of meeting the constable who apprehended her when she winked her eye
To this house Jopp and his acquaintances had arrived
The settles on which they sat down were thin and tall their tops being guyed by pieces of twine to hooks in the ceiling for when the guests grew boisterous the settles would rock and overturn without some such security
The thunder of bowls echoed from the backyard swingels hung behind the blower of the chimney and expoachers and exgamekeepers whom squires had persecuted without a cause sat elbowing each othermen who in past times had met in fights under the moon till lapse of sentences on the one part and loss of favour and expulsion from service on the other brought them here together to a common level where they sat calmly discussing old times
Dost mind how you could jerk a trout ashore with a bramble and not ruffle the stream Charl
a deposed keeper was saying
Twas at that I caught ee once if you can mind
That I can
But the worst larry for me was that pheasant business at Yalbury Wood
Your wife swore false that time JoeO by Gad she didtheres no denying it
How was that
asked Jopp
WhyJoe closed wi me and we rolled down together close to his garden hedge
Hearing the noise out ran his wife with the oven pyle and it being dark under the trees she couldnt see which was uppermost
Where beest thee Joe under or top
she screeched
Ounder by Gad
says he
She then began to rap down upon my skull back and ribs with the pyle till wed roll over again
Where beest now dear Joe under or top
shed scream again
By George twas through her I was took
And then when we got up in hall she sware that the cock pheasant was one of her rearing when twas not your bird at all Joe twas Squire Browns birdthats whose twasone that wed picked off as we passed his wood an hour afore
It did hurt my feelings to be so wrongedAh welltis over now
I might have had ee days afore that said the keeper
I was within a few yards of ee dozens of times with a sight more of birds than that poor one
Yestis not our greatest doings that the world gets wind of said the furmitywoman who lately settled in this purlieu sat among the rest
Having travelled a great deal in her time she spoke with cosmopolitan largeness of idea
It was she who presently asked Jopp what was the parcel he kept so snugly under his arm
Ah therein lies a grand secret said Jopp
It is the passion of love
To think that a woman should love one man so well and hate another so unmercifully
Whos the object of your meditation sir
One that stands high in this town
Id like to shame her
Upon my life twould be as good as a play to read her love letters the proud piece of silk and waxwork
For tis her loveletters that Ive got here
Love letters
then lets hear em good soul said Mother Cuxsom
Lord do ye mind Richard what fools we used to be when we were younger
Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us and giving him a penny do ye mind not to tell other folks what hed put inside do ye mind
By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals and unfastened the letters tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random which he read aloud
These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried though the epistles being allusive only did not make it altogether plain
Mrs Farfrae wrote that
said Nance Mockridge
Tis a humbling thing for us as respectable women that one of the same sex could do it
And now shes avowed herself to another man
So much the better for her said the aged furmitywoman
Ah I saved her from a real bad marriage and shes never been the one to thank me
I say what a good foundation for a skimmityride said Nance
True said Mrs Cuxsom reflecting
Tis as good a ground for a skimmityride as ever I knowed and it ought not to be wasted
The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago if a day
At this moment there was a shrill whistle and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl Tis Jim coming in
Would ye go and let down the bridge for me
Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the gardenpath which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned
Beyond the stream was the open moor from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces as they advanced
Taking up the board that had lain in readiness one of them lowered it across the water and the instant its further end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it and there appeared from the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees a doublebarrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him
They asked him if he had had much luck
Not much he said indifferently
All safe inside
Receiving a reply in the affirmative he went on inwards the others withdrawing the bridge and beginning to retreat in his rear
Before however they had entered the house a cry of Ahoy from the moor led them to pause
The cry was repeated
They pushed the lantern into an outhouse and went back to the brink of the stream
Ahoyis this the way to Casterbridge
said some one from the other side
Not in particular said Charl
Theres a river afore ee
I dont careheres for through it
said the man in the moor
Ive had travelling enough for today
Stop a minute then said Charl finding that the man was no enemy
Joe bring the plank and lantern heres somebody thats lost his way
You should have kept along the turnpike road friend and not have strook across here
I shouldas I see now
But I saw a light here and says I to myself thats an outlying house depend ont
The plank was now lowered and the strangers form shaped itself from the darkness
He was a middleaged man with hair and whiskers prematurely grey and a broad and genial face
He had crossed on the plank without hesitation and seemed to see nothing odd in the transit
He thanked them and walked between them up the garden
What place is this
he asked when they reached the door
A publichouse
Ah perhaps it will suit me to put up at
Now then come in and wet your whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me
They followed him into the inn where the increased light exhibited him as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by the ear
He was dressed with a certain clumsy richnesshis coat being furred and his head covered by a cap of sealskin which though the nights were chilly must have been warm for the daytime spring being somewhat advanced
In his hand he carried a small mahogany case strapped and clamped with brass
Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house but taking the situation lightly he called for glasses of the best paid for them as he stood in the passage and turned to proceed on his way by the front door
This was barred and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sittingroom and reached his ears
What do they mean by a skimmityride
he asked
O sir
said the landlady swinging her long earrings with deprecating modesty tis a old foolish thing they do in these parts when a mans wife iswell not too particularly his own
But as a respectable householder I dont encourage it
Still are they going to do it shortly
It is a good sight to see I suppose
Well sir
she simpered
And then bursting into naturalness and glancing from the corner of her eye Tis the funniest thing under the sun
And it costs money
Ah
I remember hearing of some such thing
Now I shall be in Casterbridge for two or three weeks to come and should not mind seeing the performance
Wait a moment
He turned back entered the sittingroom and said Here good folks I should like to see the old custom you are talking of and I dont mind being something towards it take that
He threw a sovereign on the table and returned to the landlady at the door of whom having inquired the way into the town he took his leave
There were more where that one came from said Charl when the sovereign had been taken up and handed to the landlady for safe keeping
By George
we ought to have got a few more while we had him here
No no answered the landlady
This is a respectable house thank God
And Ill have nothing done but whats honourable
Well said Jopp now well consider the business begun and will soon get it in train
We will
said Nance
A good laugh warms my heart more than a cordial and thats the truth ont
Jopp gathered up the letters and it being now somewhat late he did not attempt to call at Farfraes with them that night
He reached home sealed them up as before and delivered the parcel at its address next morning
Within an hour its contents were reduced to ashes by Lucetta who poor soul
was inclined to fall down on her knees in thankfulness that at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with Henchard in her past
For though hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence than of intention that episode if known was not the less likely to operate fatally between herself and her husband
37
Such was the state of things when the current affairs of Casterbridge were interrupted by an event of such magnitude that its influence reached to the lowest social stratum there stirring the depths of its society simultaneously with the preparations for the skimmington
It was one of those excitements which when they move a country town leave permanent mark upon its chronicles as a warm summer permanently marks the ring in the treetrunk corresponding to its date
A Royal Personage was about to pass through the borough on his course further west to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way
He had consented to halt halfanhour or so in the town and to receive an address from the corporation of Casterbridge which as a representative centre of husbandry wished thus to express its sense of the great services he had rendered to agricultural science and economics by his zealous promotion of designs for placing the art of farming on a more scientific footing
Royalty had not been seen in Casterbridge since the days of the third King George and then only by candlelight for a few minutes when that monarch on a nightjourney had stopped to change horses at the Kings Arms
The inhabitants therefore decided to make a thorough fete carillonee of the unwonted occasion
Halfanhours pause was not long it is true but much might be done in it by a judicious grouping of incidents above all if the weather were fine
The address was prepared on parchment by an artist who was handy at ornamental lettering and was laid on with the best goldleaf and colours that the signpainter had in his shop
The Council had met on the Tuesday before the appointed day to arrange the details of the procedure
While they were sitting the door of the Council Chamber standing open they heard a heavy footstep coming up the stairs
It advanced along the passage and Henchard entered the room in clothes of frayed and threadbare shabbiness the very clothes which he had used to wear in the primal days when he had sat among them
I have a feeling he said advancing to the table and laying his hand upon the green cloth that I should like to join ye in this reception of our illustrious visitor
I suppose I could walk with the rest
Embarrassed glances were exchanged by the Council and Grower nearly ate the end of his quillpen off so gnawed he it during the silence
Farfrae the young Mayor who by virtue of his office sat in the large chair intuitively caught the sense of the meeting and as spokesman was obliged to utter it glad as he would have been that the duty should have fallen to another tongue
I hardly see that it would be proper Mr Henchard said he
The Council are the Council and as ye are no longer one of the body there would be an irregularity in the proceeding
If ye were included why not others
I have a particular reason for wishing to assist at the ceremony
Farfrae looked round
I think I have expressed the feeling of the Council he said
Yes yes from Dr Bath Lawyer Long Alderman Tubber and several more
Then I am not to be allowed to have anything to do with it officially
I am afraid so it is out of the question indeed
But of course you can see the doings full well such as they are to be like the rest of the spectators
Henchard did not reply to that very obvious suggestion and turning on his heel went away
It had been only a passing fancy of his but opposition crystallized it into a determination
Ill welcome his Royal Highness or nobody shall
he went about saying
I am not going to be sat upon by Farfrae or any of the rest of the paltry crew
You shall see
The eventful morning was bright a fullfaced sun confronting early windowgazers eastward and all perceived for they were practised in weatherlore that there was permanence in the glow
Visitors soon began to flock in from county houses villages remote copses and lonely uplands the latter in oiled boots and tilt bonnets to see the reception or if not to see it at any rate to be near it
There was hardly a workman in the town who did not put a clean shirt on
Solomon Longways Christopher Coney Buzzford and the rest of that fraternity showed their sense of the occasion by advancing their customary eleven oclock pint to halfpast ten from which they found a difficulty in getting back to the proper hour for several days
Henchard had determined to do no work that day
He primed himself in the morning with a glass of rum and walking down the street met ElizabethJane whom he had not seen for a week
It was lucky he said to her my twentyone years had expired before this came on or I should never have had the nerve to carry it out
Carry out what
said she alarmed
This welcome I am going to give our Royal visitor
She was perplexed
Shall we go and see it together
she said
See it
I have other fish to fry
You see it
It will be worth seeing
She could do nothing to elucidate this and decked herself out with a heavy heart
As the appointed time drew near she got sight again of her stepfather
She thought he was going to the Three Mariners but no he elbowed his way through the gay throng to the shop of Woolfrey the draper
She waited in the crowd without
In a few minutes he emerged wearing to her surprise a brilliant rosette while more surprising still in his hand he carried a flag of somewhat homely construction formed by tacking one of the small Union Jacks which abounded in the town today to the end of a deal wandprobably the roller from a piece of calico
Henchard rolled up his flag on the doorstep put it under his arm and went down the street
Suddenly the taller members of the crowd turned their heads and the shorter stood on tiptoe
It was said that the Royal cortege approached
The railway had stretched out an arm towards Casterbridge at this time but had not reached it by several miles as yet so that the intervening distance as well as the remainder of the journey was to be traversed by road in the old fashion
People thus waited the county families in their carriages the masses on foot and watched the farstretching London highway to the ringing of bells and chatter of tongues
From the background ElizabethJane watched the scene
Some seats had been arranged from which ladies could witness the spectacle and the front seat was occupied by Lucetta the Mayors wife just at present
In the road under her eyes stood Henchard
She appeared so bright and pretty that as it seemed he was experiencing the momentary weakness of wishing for her notice
But he was far from attractive to a womans eye ruled as that is so largely by the superficies of things
He was not only a journeyman unable to appear as he formerly had appeared but he disdained to appear as well as he might
Everybody else from the Mayor to the washerwoman shone in new vesture according to means but Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weatherbeaten garments of bygone years
Hence alas this occurred Lucettas eyes slid over him to this side and to that without anchoring on his featuresas gaily dressed womens eyes will too often do on such occasions
Her manner signified quite plainly that she meant to know him in public no more
But she was never tired of watching Donald as he stood in animated converse with his friends a few yards off wearing round his young neck the official gold chain with great square links like that round the Royal unicorn
Every trifling emotion that her husband showed as he talked had its reflex on her face and lips which moved in little duplicates to his
She was living his part rather than her own and cared for no ones situation but Farfraes that day
At length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road namely on the second bridge of which mention has been made gave a signal and the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the Town Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town
The carriages containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a cloud of dust a procession was formed and the whole came on to the Town Hall at a walking pace
This spot was the centre of interest
There were a few clear yards in front of the Royal carriage sanded and into this space a man stepped before any one could prevent him
It was Henchard
He had unrolled his private flag and removing his hat he staggered to the side of the slowing vehicle waving the Union Jack to and fro with his left hand while he blandly held out his right to the Illustrious Personage
All the ladies said with bated breath O look there
and Lucetta was ready to faint
ElizabethJane peeped through the shoulders of those in front saw what it was and was terrified and then her interest in the spectacle as a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear
Farfrae with Mayoral authority immediately rose to the occasion
He seized Henchard by the shoulder dragged him back and told him roughly to be off
Henchards eyes met his and Farfrae observed the fierce light in them despite his excitement and irritation
For a moment Henchard stood his ground rigidly then by an unaccountable impulse gave way and retired
Farfrae glanced to the ladies gallery and saw that his Calphurnias cheek was pale
Whyit is your husbands old patron
said Mrs Blowbody a lady of the neighbourhood who sat beside Lucetta
Patron
said Donalds wife with quick indignation
Do you say the man is an acquaintance of Mr
Farfraes
observed Mrs Bath the physicians wife a newcomer to the town through her recent marriage with the doctor
He works for my husband said Lucetta
Ohis that all
They have been saying to me that it was through him your husband first got a footing in Casterbridge
What stories people will tell
They will indeed
It was not so at all
Donalds genius would have enabled him to get a footing anywhere without anybodys help
He would have been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world
It was partly Lucettas ignorance of the circumstances of Donalds arrival which led her to speak thus partly the sensation that everybody seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time
The incident had occupied but a few moments but it was necessarily witnessed by the Royal Personage who however with practised tact affected not to have noticed anything unusual
He alighted the Mayor advanced the address was read the Illustrious Personage replied then said a few words to Farfrae and shook hands with Lucetta as the Mayors wife
The ceremony occupied but a few minutes and the carriages rattled heavily as Pharaohs chariots down Corn Street and out upon the Budmouth Road in continuation of the journey coastward
In the crowd stood Coney Buzzford and Longways Some difference between him now and when he zung at the Dree Mariners said the first
Tis wonderful how he could get a lady of her quality to go snacks wi en in such quick time
True
Yet how folk do worship fine clothes
Now theres a betterlooking woman than she that nobody notices at all because shes akin to that hontish fellow Henchard
I could worship ye Buzz for saying that remarked Nance Mockridge
I do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles
I am quite unequal to the part of villain myself or Id gie all my small silver to see that lady topperedAnd perhaps I shall soon she added significantly
Thats not a noble passiont for a oman to keep up said Longways
Nance did not reply but every one knew what she meant
The ideas diffused by the reading of Lucettas letters at Peters finger had condensed into a scandal which was spreading like a miasmatic fog through Mixen Lane and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge
The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection the frequenters of Peters Finger going off Mixen Lane wards where most of them lived while Coney Buzzford Longways and that connection remained in the street
You know whats brewing down there I suppose
said Buzzford mysteriously to the others
Coney looked at him
Not the skimmityride
Buzzford nodded
I have my doubts if it will be carried out said Longways
If they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close
I heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago at all events
If I were sure ot Id lay information said Longways emphatically
Tis too rough a joke and apt to wake riots in towns
We know that the Scotchman is a right enough man and that his lady has been a right enough oman since she came here and if there was anything wrong about her afore thats their business not ours
Coney reflected
Farfrae was still liked in the community but it must be owned that as the Mayor and man of money engrossed with affairs and ambitions he had lost in the eyes of the poorer inhabitants something of that wondrous charm which he had had for them as a lighthearted penniless young man who sang ditties as readily as the birds in the trees
Hence the anxiety to keep him from annoyance showed not quite the ardour that would have animated it in former days
Suppose we make inquiration into it Christopher continued Longways and if we find theres really anything in it drop a letter to them most concerned and advise em to keep out of the way
This course was decided on and the group separated Buzzford saying to Coney Come my ancient friend lets move on
Theres nothing more to see here
These wellintentioned ones would have been surprised had they known how ripe the great jocular plot really was
Yes tonight Jopp had said to the Peters party at the corner of Mixen Lane
As a windup to the Royal visit the hit will be all the more pat by reason of their great elevation today
To him at least it was not a joke but a retaliation
38
The proceedings had been brieftoo briefto Lucetta whom an intoxicating Weltlust had fairly mastered but they had brought her a great triumph nevertheless
The shake of the Royal hand still lingered in her fingers and the chit chat she had overheard that her husband might possibly receive the honour of knighthood though idle to a degree seemed not the wildest vision stranger things had occurred to men so good and captivating as her Scotchman was
After the collision with the Mayor Henchard had withdrawn behind the ladies stand and there he stood regarding with a stare of abstraction the spot on the lapel of his coat where Farfraes hand had seized it
He put his own hand there as if he could hardly realize such an outrage from one whom it had once been his wont to treat with ardent generosity
While pausing in this halfstupefied state the conversation of Lucetta with the other ladies reached his ears and he distinctly heard her deny himdeny that he had assisted Donald that he was anything more than a common journeyman
He moved on homeward and met Jopp in the archway to the Bull Stake
So youve had a snub said Jopp
And what if I have
answered Henchard sternly
Why Ive had one too so we are both under the same cold shade
He briefly related his attempt to win Lucettas intercession
Henchard merely heard his story without taking it deeply in
His own relation to Farfrae and Lucetta overshadowed all kindred ones
He went on saying brokenly to himself She has supplicated to me in her time and now her tongue wont own me nor her eyes see meAnd hehow angry he looked
He drove me back as if I were a bull breaking fenceI took it like a lamb for I saw it could not be settled there
He can rub brine on a green woundBut he shall pay for it and she shall be sorry
It must come to a tussleface to face and then well see how a coxcomb can front a man
Without further reflection the fallen merchant bent on some wild purpose ate a hasty dinner and went forth to find Farfrae
After being injured by him as a rival and snubbed by him as a journeyman the crowning degradation had been reserved for this daythat he should be shaken at the collar by him as a vagabond in the face of the whole town
The crowds had dispersed
But for the green arches which still stood as they were erected Casterbridge life had resumed its ordinary shape
Henchard went down corn Street till he came to Farfraes house where he knocked and left a message that he would be glad to see his employer at the granaries as soon as he conveniently could come there
Having done this he proceeded round to the back and entered the yard
Nobody was present for as he had been aware the labourers and carters were enjoying a halfholiday on account of the events of the morningthough the carters would have to return for a short time later on to feed and litter down the horses
He had reached the granary steps and was about to ascend when he said to himself aloud Im stronger than he
Henchard returned to a shed where he selected a short piece of rope from several pieces that were lying about hitching one end of this to a nail he took the other in his right hand and turned himself bodily round while keeping his arm against his side by this contrivance he pinioned the arm effectively
He now went up the ladders to the top floor of the cornstores
It was empty except of a few sacks and at the further end was the door often mentioned opening under the cathead and chain that hoisted the sacks
He fixed the door open and looked over the sill
There was a depth of thirty or forty feet to the ground here was the spot on which he had been standing with Farfrae when ElizabethJane had seen him lift his arm with many misgivings as to what the movement portended
He retired a few steps into the loft and waited
From this elevated perch his eyes could sweep the roofs round about the upper parts of the luxurious chestnut trees now delicate in leaves of a weeks age and the drooping boughs of the lines Farfraes garden and the green door leading therefrom
In course of timehe could not say how long that green door opened and Farfrae came through
He was dressed as if for a journey
The low light of the nearing evening caught his head and face when he emerged from the shadow of the wall warming them to a complexion of flame colour
Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked
Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind
They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners a poor young man adventuring for life and fortune and scarcely knowing witherward And heres a hand my trusty fiere And gies a hand o thine
Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody
He sank back
No I cant do it
he gasped
Why does the infernal fool begin that now
At length Farfrae was silent and Henchard looked out of the loft door
Will ye come up here
he said
Ay man said Farfrae
I couldnt see ye
Whats wrang
A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder
He heard him land on the first floor ascend and land on the second begin the ascent to the third
And then his head rose through the trap behind
What are you doing up here at this time
he asked coming forward
Why didnt ye take your holiday like the rest of the men
He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking
Henchard said nothing but going back he closed the stair hatchway and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame he next turned to the wondering young man who by this time observed that one of Henchards arms was bound to his side
Now said Henchard quietly we stand face to faceman and man
Your money and your fine wife no longer lift ee above me as they did but now and my poverty does not press me down
What does it all mean
asked Farfrae simply
Wait a bit my lad
You should ha thought twice before you affronted to extremes a man who had nothing to lose
Ive stood your rivalry which ruined me and your snubbing which humbled me but your hustling that disgraced me I wont stand
Farfrae warmed a little at this
Yed no business there he said
As much as any one among ye
What you forward stripling tell a man of my age hed no business there
The angervein swelled in his forehead as he spoke
You insulted Royalty Henchard and twas my duty as the chief magistrate to stop you
Royalty be damned said Henchard
I am as loyal as you come to that
I am not here to argue
Wait till you cool doon wait till you cool and you will see things the same way as I do
You may be the one to cool first said Henchard grimly
Now this is the case
Here be we in this foursquare loft to finish out that little wrestle you began this morning
Theres the door forty foot above ground
One of us two puts the other out by that doorthe master stays inside
If he likes he may go down afterwards and give the alarm that the other has fallen out by accidentor he may tell the truththats his business
As the strongest man Ive tied one arm to take no advantage of ee
Dye understand
Then heres at ee
There was no time for Farfrae to do aught but one thing to close with Henchard for the latter had come on at once
It was a wrestling match the object of each being to give his antagonist a back fall and on Henchards part unquestionably that it should be through the door
At the outset Henchards hold by his only free hand the right was on the left side of Farfraes collar which he firmly grappled the latter holding Henchard by his collar with the contrary hand
With his right he endeavoured to get hold of his antagonists left arm which however he could not do so adroitly did Henchard keep it in the rear as he gazed upon the lowered eyes of his fair and slim antagonist
Henchard planted the first toe forward Farfrae crossing him with his and thus far the struggle had very much the appearance of the ordinary wrestling of those parts
Several minutes were passed by them in this attitude the pair rocking and writhing like trees in a gale both preserving an absolute silence
By this time their breathing could be heard
Then Farfrae tried to get hold of the other side of Henchards collar which was resisted by the larger man exerting all his force in a wrenching movement and this part of the struggle ended by his forcing Farfrae down on his knees by sheer pressure of one of his muscular arms
Hampered as he was however he could not keep him there and Farfrae finding his feet again the struggle proceeded as before
By a whirl Henchard brought Donald dangerously near the precipice seeing his position the Scotchman for the first time locked himself to his adversary and all the efforts of that infuriated Prince of Darknessas he might have been called from his appearance just nowwere inadequate to lift or loosen Farfrae for a time
By an extraordinary effort he succeeded at last though not until they had got far back again from the fatal door
In doing so Henchard contrived to turn Farfrae a complete somersault
Had Henchards other arm been free it would have been all over with Farfrae then
But again he regained his feet wrenching Henchards arm considerably and causing him sharp pain as could be seen from the twitching of his face
He instantly delivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left forehip as it used to be expressed and following up his advantage thrust him towards the door never loosening his hold till Farfraes fair head was hanging over the windowsill and his arm dangling down outside the wall
Now said Henchard between his gasps this is the end of what you began this morning
Your life is in my hands
Then take it take it
said Farfrae
Yeve wished to long enough
Henchard looked down upon him in silence and their eyes met
O Farfraethats not true
he said bitterly
God is my witness that no man ever loved another as I did thee at one timeAnd nowthough I came here to kill ee I cannot hurt thee
Go and give me in chargedo what you willI care nothing for what comes of me
He withdrew to the back part of the loft loosened his arm and flung himself in a corner upon some sacks in the abandonment of remorse
Farfrae regarded him in silence then went to the hatch and descended through it
Henchard would fain have recalled him but his tongue failed in its task and the young mans steps died on his ear
Henchard took his full measure of shame and selfreproach
The scenes of his first acquaintance with Farfrae rushed back upon himthat time when the curious mixture of romance and thrift in the young mans composition so commanded his heart that Farfrae could play upon him as on an instrument
So thoroughly subdued was he that he remained on the sacks in a crouching attitude unusual for a man and for such a man
Its womanliness sat tragically on the figure of so stern a piece of virility
He heard a conversation below the opening of the coachhouse door and the putting in of a horse but took no notice
Here he stayed till the thin shades thickened to opaque obscurity and the loftdoor became an oblong of gray light the only visible shape around
At length he arose shook the dust from his clothes wearily felt his way to the hatch and gropingly descended the steps till he stood in the yard
He thought highly of me once he murmured
Now hell hate me and despise me for ever
He became possessed by an overpowering wish to see Farfrae again that night and by some desperate pleading to attempt the wellnigh impossible task of winning pardon for his late mad attack
But as he walked towards Farfraes door he recalled the unheeded doings in the yard while he had lain above in a sort of stupor
Farfrae he remembered had gone to the stable and put the horse into the gig while doing so Whittle had brought him a letter Farfrae had then said that he would not go towards Budmouth as he had intendedthat he was unexpectedly summoned to Weatherbury and meant to call at Mellstock on his way thither that place lying but one or two miles out of his course
He must have come prepared for a journey when he first arrived in the yard unsuspecting enmity and he must have driven off though in a changed direction without saying a word to any one on what had occurred between themselves
It would therefore be useless to call at Farfraes house till very late
There was no help for it but to wait till his return though waiting was almost torture to his restless and selfaccusing soul
He walked about the streets and outskirts of the town lingering here and there till he reached the stone bridge of which mention has been made an accustomed haltingplace with him now
Here he spent a long time the purl of waters through the weirs meeting his ear and the Casterbridge lights glimmering at no great distance off
While leaning thus upon the parapet his listless attention was awakened by sounds of an unaccustomed kind from the town quarter
They were a confusion of rhythmical noises to which the streets added yet more confusion by encumbering them with echoes
His first incurious thought that the clangour arose from the town band engaged in an attempt to round off a memorable day in a burst of evening harmony was contradicted by certain peculiarities of reverberation
But inexplicability did not rouse him to more than a cursory heed his sense of degradation was too strong for the admission of foreign ideas and he leant against the parapet as before
39
When Farfrae descended out of the loft breathless from his encounter with Henchard he paused at the bottom to recover himself
He arrived at the yard with the intention of putting the horse into the gig himself all the men having a holiday and driving to a village on the Budmouth Road
Despite the fearful struggle he decided still to persevere in his journey so as to recover himself before going indoors and meeting the eyes of Lucetta
He wished to consider his course in a case so serious
When he was just on the point of driving off Whittle arrived with a note badly addressed and bearing the word immediate upon the outside
On opening it he was surprised to see that it was unsigned
It contained a brief request that he would go to Weatherbury that evening about some business which he was conducting there
Farfrae knew nothing that could make it pressing but as he was bent upon going out he yielded to the anonymous request particularly as he had a call to make at Mellstock which could be included in the same tour
Thereupon he told Whittle of his change of direction in words which Henchard had overheard and set out on his way
Farfrae had not directed his man to take the message indoors and Whittle had not been supposed to do so on his own responsibility
Now the anonymous letter was a wellintentioned but clumsy contrivance of Longways and other of Farfraes men to get him out of the way for the evening in order that the satirical mummery should fall flat if it were attempted
By giving open information they would have brought down upon their heads the vengeance of those among their comrades who enjoyed these boisterous old games and therefore the plan of sending a letter recommended itself by its indirectness
For poor Lucetta they took no protective measure believing with the majority there was some truth in the scandal which she would have to bear as she best might
It was about eight oclock and Lucetta was sitting in the drawingroom alone
Night had set in for more than half an hour but she had not had the candles lighted for when Farfrae was away she preferred waiting for him by the firelight and if it were not too cold keeping one of the windowsashes a little way open that the sound of his wheels might reach her ears early
She was leaning back in the chair in a more hopeful mood than she had enjoyed since her marriage
The day had been such a success and the temporary uneasiness which Henchards show of effrontery had wrought in her disappeared with the quiet disappearance of Henchard himself under her husbands reproof
The floating evidences of her absurd passion for him and its consequences had been destroyed and she really seemed to have no cause for fear
The reverie in which these and other subjects mingled was disturbed by a hubbub in the distance that increased moment by moment
It did not greatly surprise her the afternoon having been given up to recreation by a majority of the populace since the passage of the Royal equipages
But her attention was at once riveted to the matter by the voice of a maidservant next door who spoke from an upper window across the street to some other maid even more elevated than she
Which way be they going now
inquired the first with interest
I cant be sure for a moment said the second because of the malters chimbley
O yesI can see em
Well I declare I declare
What what
from the first more enthusiastically
They are coming up Corn Street after all
They sit back to back
Whattwo of emare there two figures
Yes
Two images on a donkey back to back their elbows tied to one anothers
Shes facing the head and hes facing the tail
Is it meant for anybody in particular
Wellit mid be
The man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere leggings he has black whiskers and a reddish face
Tis a stuffed figure with a falseface
The din was increasing nowthen it lessened a little
ThereI shant see after all
cried the disappointed first maid
They have gone into a back streetthats all said the one who occupied the enviable position in the attic
Therenow I have got em all endways nicely
Whats the woman like
Just say and I can tell in a moment if tis meant for one Ive in mind
Mywhytis dressed just as SHE dressed when she sat in the front seat at the time the playactors came to the Town Hall
Lucetta started to her feet and almost at the instant the door of the room was quickly and softly opened
Elizabeth Jane advanced into the firelight
I have come to see you she said breathlessly
I did not stop to knockforgive me
I see you have not shut your shutters and the window is open
Without waiting for Lucettas reply she crossed quickly to the window and pulled out one of the shutters
Lucetta glided to her side
Let it behush
she said perempority in a dry voice while she seized ElizabethJane by the hand and held up her finger
Their intercourse had been so low and hurried that not a word had been lost of the conversation without which had thus proceeded Her neck is uncovered and her hair in bands and her back comb in place shes got on a puce silk and white stockings and coloured shoes
Again ElizabethJane attempted to close the window but Lucetta held her by main force
Tis me
she said with a face pale as death
A processiona scandalan effigy of me and him
The look of Elizabeth betrayed that the latter knew it already
Let us shut it out coaxed ElizabethJane noting that the rigid wildness of Lucettas features was growing yet more rigid and wild with the meaning of the noise and laughter
Let us shut it out
It is of no use
she shrieked
He will see it wont he
Donald will see it
He is just coming homeand it will break his hearthe will never love me any moreand O it will kill mekill me
ElizabethJane was frantic now
O cant something be done to stop it
she cried
Is there nobody to do itnot one
She relinquished Lucettas hands and ran to the door
Lucetta herself saying recklessly I will see it
turned to the window threw up the sash and went out upon the balcony
Elizabeth immediately followed and put her arm round her to pull her in
Lucettas eyes were straight upon the spectacle of the uncanny revel now dancing rapidly
The numerous lights round the two effigies threw them up into lurid distinctness it was impossible to mistake the pair for other than the intended victims
Come in come in implored Elizabeth and let me shut the window
Shes meshes meeven to the parasolmy green parasol
cried Lucetta with a wild laugh as she stepped in
She stood motionless for one secondthen fell heavily to the floor
Almost at the instant of her fall the rude music of the skimmington ceased
The roars of sarcastic laughter went off in ripples and the trampling died out like the rustle of a spent wind
Elizabeth was only indirectly conscious of this she had rung the bell and was bending over Lucetta who remained convulsed on the carpet in the paroxysms of an epileptic seizure
She rang again and again in vain the probability being that the servants had all run out of the house to see more of the Daemonic Sabbath than they could see within
At last Farfraes man who had been agape on the door step came up then the cook
The shutters hastily pushed to by Elizabeth were quite closed a light was obtained Lucetta carried to her room and the man sent off for a doctor
While Elizabeth was undressing her she recovered consciousness but as soon as she remembered what had passed the fit returned
The doctor arrived with unhopedfor promptitude he had been standing at his door like others wondering what the uproar meant
As soon as he saw the unhappy sufferer he said in answer to Elizabeths mute appeal This is serious
It is a fit Elizabeth said
Yes
But a fit in the present state of her health means mischief
You must send at once for Mr Farfrae
Where is he
He has driven into the country sir said the parlour maid to some place on the Budmouth Road
Hes likely to be back soon
Never mind he must be sent for in case he should not hurry
The doctor returned to the bedside again
The man was despatched and they soon heard him clattering out of the yard at the back
Meanwhile Mr Benjamin Grower that prominent burgess of whom mention has been already made hearing the din of cleavers tongs tambourines kits crouds humstrums serpents ramshorns and other historical kinds of music as he sat indoors in the High Street had put on his hat and gone out to learn the cause
He came to the corner above Farfraes and soon guessed the nature of the proceedings for being a native of the town he had witnessed such rough jests before
His first move was to search hither and thither for the constables there were two in the town shrivelled men whom he ultimately found in hiding up an alley yet more shrivelled than usual having some not ungrounded fears that they might be roughly handled if seen
What can we two poor lammigers do against such a multitude
expostulated Stubberd in answer to Mr Growers chiding
Tis tempting em to commit felodese upon us and that would be the death of the perpetrator and we wouldnt be the cause of a fellowcreatures death on no account not we
Get some help then
Here Ill come with you
Well see what a few words of authority can do
Quick now have you got your staves
We didnt want the folk to notice us as law officers being so shorthanded sir so we pushed our Goverment staves up this waterpipe
Out with em and come along for Heavens sake
Ah heres Mr Blowbody thats lucky
Blowbody was the third of the three borough magistrates
Well whats the row
said Blowbody
Got their names hey
No
Now said Grower to one of the constables you go with Mr Blowbody round by the Old Walk and come up the street and Ill go with Stubberd straight forward
By this plan we shall have em between us
Get their names only no attack or interruption
Thus they started
But as Stubberd with Mr Grower advanced into Corn Street whence the sounds had proceeded they were surprised that no procession could be seen
They passed Farfraes and looked to the end of the street
The lamp flames waved the Walk trees soughed a few loungers stood about with their hands in their pockets
Everything was as usual
Have you seen a motley crowd making a disturbance
Grower said magisterially to one of these in a fustian jacket who smoked a short pipe and wore straps round his knees
Beg yer pardon sir
blandly said the person addressed who was no other than Charl of Peters finger
Mr Grower repeated the words
Charl shook his head to the zero of childlike ignorance
No we havent seen anything have we Joe
And you was here afore I
Joseph was quite as blank as the other in his reply
Hmthats odd said Mr Grower
Ahheres a respectable man coming that I know by sight
Have you he inquired addressing the nearing shape of Jopp have you seen any gang of fellows making a devil of a noise skimmington riding or something of the sort
O nonothing sir Jopp replied as if receiving the most singular news
But Ive not been far tonight so perhaps  Oh twas herejust here said the magistrate
Now Ive noticed come to think ot that the wind in the Walk trees makes a peculiar poeticallike murmur tonight sir more than common so perhaps twas that
Jopp suggested as he rearranged his hand in his greatcoat pocket where it ingeniously supported a pair of kitchen tongs and a cows horn thrust up under his waistcoat
No no nodye think Im a fool
Constable come this way
They must have gone into the back street
Neither in back street nor in front street however could the disturbers be perceived and Blowbody and the second constable who came up at this time brought similar intelligence
Effigies donkey lanterns band all had disappeared like the crew of Comus
Now said Mr Grower theres only one thing more we can do
Get ye halfadozen helpers and go in a body to Mixen Lane and into Peters finger
Im much mistaken if you dont find a clue to the perpetrators there
The rustyjointed executors of the law mustered assistance as soon as they could and the whole party marched off to the lane of notoriety
It was no rapid matter to get there at night not a lamp or glimmer of any sort offering itself to light the way except an occasional pale radiance through some windowcurtain or through the chink of some door which could not be closed because of the smoky chimney within
At last they entered the inn boldly by the till then bolted frontdoor after a prolonged knocking of loudness commensurate with the importance of their standing
In the settles of the large room guyed to the ceiling by cords as usual for stability an ordinary group sat drinking and smoking with statuesque quiet of demeanour
The landlady looked mildly at the invaders saying in honest accents Good evening gentlemen theres plenty of room
I hope theres nothing amiss
They looked round the room
Surely said Stubberd to one of the men I saw you by now in Corn StreetMr Grower spoke to ee
The man who was Charl shook his head absently
Ive been here this last hour haint I Nance
he said to the woman who meditatively sipped her ale near him
Faith that you have
I came in for my quiet supper time halfpint and you were here then as well as all the rest
The other constable was facing the clockcase where he saw reflected in the glass a quick motion by the landlady
Turning sharply he caught her closing the ovendoor
Something curious about that oven maam
he observed advancing opening it and drawing out a tambourine
Ah she said apologetically thats what we keep here to use when theres a little quiet dancing
You see damp weather spoils it so I put it there to keep it dry
The constable nodded knowingly but what he knew was nothing
Nohow could anything be elicited from this mute and inoffensive assembly
In a few minutes the investigators went out and joining those of their auxiliaries who had been left at the door they pursued their way elsewhither
40
Long before this time Henchard weary of his ruminations on the bridge had repaired towards the town
When he stood at the bottom of the street a procession burst upon his view in the act of turning out of an alley just above him
The lanterns horns and multitude startled him he saw the mounted images and knew what it all meant
They crossed the way entered another street and disappeared
He turned back a few steps and was lost in grave reflection finally wending his way homeward by the obscure riverside path
Unable to rest there he went to his stepdaughters lodging and was told that Elizabeth Jane had gone to Mr Farfraes
Like one acting in obedience to a charm and with a nameless apprehension he followed in the same direction in the hope of meeting her the roysterers having vanished
Disappointed in this he gave the gentlest of pulls to the doorbell and then learnt particulars of what had occurred together with the doctors imperative orders that Farfrae should be brought home and how they had set out to meet him on the Budmouth Road
But he has gone to Mellstock and Weatherbury
exclaimed Henchard now unspeakably grieved
Not Budmouth way at all
But alas
for Henchard he had lost his good name
They would not believe him taking his words but as the frothy utterances of recklessness
Though Lucettas life seemed at that moment to depend upon her husbands return she being in great mental agony lest he should never know the unexaggerated truth of her past relations with Henchard no messenger was despatched towards Weatherbury
Henchard in a state of bitter anxiety and contrition determined to seek Farfrae himself
To this end he hastened down the town ran along the eastern road over Durnover Moor up the hill beyond and thus onward in the moderate darkness of this spring night till he had reached a second and almost a third hill about three miles distant
In Yalbury Bottom or Plain at the foot of the hill he listened
At first nothing beyond his own heart throbs was to be heard but the slow wind making its moan among the masses of spruce and larch of Yalbury Wood which clothed the heights on either hand but presently there came the sound of light wheels whetting their felloes against the newly stoned patches of road accompanied by the distant glimmer of lights
He knew it was Farfraes gig descending the hill from an indescribable personality in its noise the vehicle having been his own till bought by the Scotchman at the sale of his effects
Henchard thereupon retraced his steps along Yalbury Plain the gig coming up with him as its driver slackened speed between two plantations
It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction
By diverging to that village as he had intended to do Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours
It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane the byroad aforesaid
Farfraes off giglamp flashed in Henchards face
At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist
FarfraeMr
Farfrae
cried the breathless Henchard holding up his hand
Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up
He then drew rein and said Yes
over his shoulder as one would towards a pronounced enemy
Come back to Casterbridge at once
Henchard said
Theres something wrong at your houserequiring your return
Ive run all the way here on purpose to tell ye
Farfrae was silent and at his silence Henchards soul sank within him
Why had he not before this thought of what was only too obvious
He who four hours earlier had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood now in the darkness of late nighttime on a lonely road inviting him to come a particular way where an assailant might have confederates instead of going his purposed way where there might be a better opportunity of guarding himself from attack
Henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfraes mind
I have to go to Mellstock said Farfrae coldly as he loosened his reins to move on
But implored Henchard the matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock
It isyour wife
She is ill
I can tell you particulars as we go along
The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfraes suspicion that this was a ruse to decoy him on to the next wood where might be effectually compassed what from policy or want of nerve Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day
He started the horse
I know what you think deprecated Henchard running after almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friends eyes
But I am not what you think
he cried hoarsely
Believe me Farfrae I have come entirely on your own and your wifes account
She is in danger
I know no more and they want you to come
Your man has gone the other way in a mistake
O Farfrae
dont mistrust meI am a wretched man but my heart is true to you still
Farfrae however did distrust him utterly
He knew his wife was with child but he had left her not long ago in perfect health and Henchards treachery was more credible than his story
He had in his time heard bitter ironies from Henchards lips and there might be ironies now
He quickened the horses pace and had soon risen into the high country lying between there and Mellstock Henchards spasmodic run after him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil purposes
The gig and its driver lessened against the sky in Henchards eyes his exertions for Farfraes good had been in vain
Over this repentant sinner at least there was to be no joy in heaven
He cursed himself like a less scrupulous Job as a vehement man will do when he loses selfrespect the last mental prop under poverty
To this he had come after a time of emotional darkness of which the adjoining woodland shade afforded inadequate illustration
Presently he began to walk back again along the way by which he had arrived
Farfrae should at all events have no reason for delay upon the road by seeing him there when he took his journey homeward later on
Arriving at Casterbridge Henchard went again to Farfraes house to make inquiries
As soon as the door opened anxious faces confronted his from the staircase hall and landing and they all said in grievous disappointment Oit is not he
The manservant finding his mistake had long since returned and all hopes had centred upon Henchard
But havent you found him
said the doctor
YesI cannot tell ee
Henchard replied as he sank down on a chair within the entrance
He cant be home for two hours
Hm said the surgeon returning upstairs
How is she
asked Henchard of Elizabeth who formed one of the group
In great danger father
Her anxiety to see her husband makes her fearfully restless
Poor womanI fear they have killed her
Henchard regarded the sympathetic speaker for a few instants as if she struck him in a new light then without further remark went out of the door and onward to his lonely cottage
So much for mans rivalry he thought
Death was to have the oyster and Farfrae and himself the shells
But about Elizabethlane in the midst of his gloom she seemed to him as a pinpoint of light
He had liked the look on her face as she answered him from the stairs
There had been affection in it and above all things what he desired now was affection from anything that was good and pure
She was not his own yet for the first time he had a faint dream that he might get to like her as his ownif she would only continue to love him
Jopp was just going to bed when Henchard got home
As the latter entered the door Jopp said This is rather bad about Mrs Farfraes illness
Yes said Henchard shortly though little dreaming of Jopp s complicity in the nights harlequinade and raising his eyes just sufficiently to observe that Jopps face was lined with anxiety
Somebody has called for you continued Jopp when Henchard was shutting himself into his own apartment
A kind of traveller or seacaptain of some sort
Ohwho could he be
He seemed a wellbedoing manhad grey hair and a broadish face but he gave no name and no message
Nor do I gie him any attention
And saying this Henchard closed his door
The divergence to Mellstock delayed Farfraes return very nearly the two hours of Henchards estimate
Among the other urgent reasons for his presence had been the need of his authority to send to Budmouth for a second physician and when at length Farfrae did come back he was in a state bordering on distraction at his misconception of Henchards motives
A messenger was despatched to Budmouth late as it had grown the night wore on and the other doctor came in the small hours
Lucetta had been much soothed by Donalds arrival he seldom or never left her side and when immediately after his entry she had tried to lisp out to him the secret which so oppressed her he checked her feeble words lest talking should be dangerous assuring her there was plenty of time to tell him everything
Up to this time he knew nothing of the skimmingtonride
The dangerous illness and miscarriage of Mrs Farfrae was soon rumoured through the town and an apprehensive guess having been given as to its cause by the leaders in the exploit compunction and fear threw a dead silence over all particulars of their orgie while those immediately around Lucetta would not venture to add to her husbands distress by alluding to the subject
What and how much Farfraes wife ultimately explained to him of her past entanglement with Henchard when they were alone in the solitude of that sad night cannot be told
That she informed him of the bare facts of her peculiar intimacy with the cornmerchant became plain from Farfraes own statements
But in respect of her subsequent conduct her motive in coming to Casterbridge to unite herself with Henchardher assumed justification in abandoning him when she discovered reasons for fearing him though in truth her inconsequent passion for another man at first sight had most to do with that abandonmenther method of reconciling to her conscience a marriage with the second when she was in a measure committed to the first to what extent she spoke of these things remained Farfraes secret alone
Besides the watchman who called the hours and weather in Casterbridge that night there walked a figure up and down corn Street hardly less frequently
It was Henchards whose retiring to rest had proved itself a futility as soon as attempted and he gave it up to go hither and thither and make inquiries about the patient every now and then
He called as much on Farfraes account as on Lucettas and on ElizabethJanes even more than on eithers
Shorn one by one of all other interests his life seemed centring on the personality of the stepdaughter whose presence but recently he could not endure
To see her on each occasion of his inquiry at Lucettas was a comfort to him
The last of his calls was made about four oclock in the morning in the steely light of dawn
Lucifer was fading into day across Durnover Moor the sparrows were just alighting into the street and the hens had begun to cackle from the outhouses
When within a few yards of Farfraes he saw the door gently opened and a servant raise her hand to the knocker to untie the piece of cloth which had muffled it
He went across the sparrows in his way scarcely flying up from the roadlitter so little did they believe in human aggression at so early a time
Why do you take off that
said Henchard
She turned in some surprise at his presence and did not answer for an instant or two
Recognizing him she said Because they may knock as loud as they will she will never hear it any more
41
Henchard went home
The morning having now fully broke he lit his fire and sat abstractedly beside it
He had not sat there long when a gentle footstep approached the house and entered the passage a finger tapping lightly at the door
Henchards face brightened for he knew the motions to be Elizabeths
She came into his room looking wan and sad
Have you heard
she asked
Mrs Farfrae
She isdead
Yes indeedabout an hour ago
I know it said Henchard
I have but lately come in from there
It is so very good of ee Elizabeth to come and tell me
You must be so tired out too with sitting up
Now do you bide here with me this morning
You can go and rest in the other room and I will call ee when breakfast is ready
To please him and herselffor his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girlshe did as he bade her and lay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room
She could hear him moving about in his preparations but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected
Presently she fell asleep
Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness but finding that she dozed he would not call her he waited on looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with housewifely care as if it were an honour to have her in his house
In truth a great change had come over him with regard to her and he was developing the dream of a future lit by her filial presence as though that way alone could happiness lie
He was disturbed by another knock at the door and rose to open it rather deprecating a call from anybody just then
A stoutly built man stood on the doorstep with an alien unfamiliar air about his figure and bearingan air which might have been called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience
It was the man who had asked the way at Peters finger
Henchard nodded and looked inquiry
Good morning good morning said the stranger with profuse heartiness
Is it Mr Henchard I am talking to
My name is Henchard
Then Ive caught ee at homethats right
Mornings the time for business says I
Can I have a few words with you
By all means Henchard answered showing the way in
You may remember me
said his visitor seating himself
Henchard observed him indifferently and shook his head
Wellperhaps you may not
My name is Newson
Henchards face and eyes seemed to die
The other did not notice it
I know the name well Henchard said at last looking on the floor
I make no doubt of that
Well the fact is Ive been looking for ee this fortnight past
I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth and when I got there they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge
Back came I again and by long and by late I got here by coach ten minutes ago
He lives down by the mill says they
So here I am
Nowthat transaction between us some twenty years agonetis that Ive called about
Twas a curious business
I was younger then than I am now and perhaps the less said about it in one sense the better
Curious business
Twas worse than curious
I cannot even allow that Im the man you met then
I was not in my senses and a mans senses are himself
We were young and thoughtless said Newson
However Ive come to mend matters rather than open arguments
Poor Susanhers was a strange experience
She was a warmhearted homespun woman
She was not what they call shrewd or sharp at allbetter she had been
She was not
As you in all likelihood know she was simpleminded enough to think that the sale was in a way binding
She was as guiltless o wrongdoing in that particular as a saint in the clouds
I know it I know it
I found it out directly said Henchard still with averted eyes
There lay the sting ot to me
If she had seen it as what it was she would never have left me
Never
But how should she be expected to know
What advantages had she
None
She could write her own name and no more
Well it was not in my heart to undeceive her when the deed was done said the sailor of former days
I thought and there was not much vanity in thinking it that she would be happier with me
She was fairly happy and I never would have undeceived her till the day of her death
Your child died she had another and all went well
But a time came mind me a time always does come
A time cameit was some while after she and I and the child returned from America when somebody she had confided her history to told her my claim to her was a mockery and made a jest of her belief in my right
After that she was never happy with me
She pined and pined and socked and sighed
She said she must leave me and then came the question of our child
Then a man advised me how to act and I did it for I thought it was best
I left her at Falmouth and went off to sea
When I got to the other side of the Atlantic there was a storm and it was supposed that a lot of us including myself had been washed overboard
I got ashore at Newfoundland and then I asked myself what I should do
Since Im here here Ill bide I thought to myself twill be most kindness to her now shes taken against me to let her believe me lost for I thought while she supposes us both alive shell be miserable but if she thinks me dead shell go back to him and the child will have a home
Ive never returned to this country till a month ago and I found that as I supposed she went to you and my daughter with her
They told me in Falmouth that Susan was dead
But my ElizabethJanewhere is she
Dead likewise said Henchard doggedly
Surely you learnt that too
The sailor started up and took an enervated pace or two down the room
Dead
he said in a low voice
Then whats the use of my money to me
Henchard without answering shook his head as if that were rather a question for Newson himself than for him
Where is she buried
the traveller inquired
Beside her mother said Henchard in the same stolid tones
When did she die
A year ago and more replied the other without hesitation
The sailor continued standing
Henchard never looked up from the floor
At last Newson said My journey hither has been for nothing
I may as well go as I came
It has served me right
Ill trouble you no longer
Henchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded floor the mechanical lifting of the latch the slow opening and closing of the door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man but he did not turn his head
Newsons shadow passed the window
He was gone
Then Henchard scarcely believing the evidence of his senses rose from his seat amazed at what he had done
It had been the impulse of a moment
The regard he had lately acquired for Elizabeth the newsprung hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he could feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed herself to be had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her so that the sudden prospect of her loss had caused him to speak mad lies like a child in pure mockery of consequences
He had expected questions to close in round him and unmask his fabrication in five minutes yet such questioning had not come
But surely they would come Newsons departure could be but momentary he would learn all by inquiries in the town and return to curse him and carry his last treasure away
He hastily put on his hat and went out in the direction that Newson had taken
Newsons back was soon visible up the road crossing Bullstake
Henchard followed and saw his visitor stop at the Kings Arms where the morning coach which had brought him waited halfanhour for another coach which crossed there
The coach Newson had come by was now about to move again
Newson mounted his luggage was put in and in a few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him
He had not so much as turned his head
It was an act of simple faith in Henchards wordsfaith so simple as to be almost sublime
The young sailor who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the faith of a glance at her face more than twenty years before was still living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who had taken Henchards words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he stood
Was ElizabethJane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a moment
Perhaps not for long said he
Newson might converse with his fellowtravellers some of whom might be Casterbridge people and the trick would be discovered
This probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude and instead of considering how best to right the wrong and acquaint Elizabeths father with the truth at once he bethought himself of ways to keep the position he had accidentally won
Towards the young woman herself his affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his claim to her was exposed
He watched the distant highway expecting to see Newson return on foot enlightened and indignant to claim his child
But no figure appeared
Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach but buried his grief in his own heart
His griefwhat was it after all to that which he Henchard would feel at the loss of her
Newsons affection cooled by years could not equal his who had been constantly in her presence
And thus his jealous soul speciously argued to excuse the separation of father and child
He returned to the house half expecting that she would have vanished
No there she wasjust coming out from the inner room the marks of sleep upon her eyelids and exhibiting a generally refreshed air
O father
she said smiling
I had no sooner lain down than I napped though I did not mean to
I wonder I did not dream about poor Mrs Farfrae after thinking of her so but I did not
How strange it is that we do not often dream of latest events absorbing as they may be
I am glad you have been able to sleep he said taking her hand with anxious proprietorshipan act which gave her a pleasant surprise
They sat down to breakfast and ElizabethJanes thoughts reverted to Lucetta
Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness
Father she said as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal it is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands and I idly asleep the while
I do it every day he replied
You have left me everybody has left me how should I live but by my own hands
You are very lonely are you not
Ay childto a degree that you know nothing of
It is my own fault
You are the only one who has been near me for weeks
And you will come no more
Why do you say that
Indeed I will if you would like to see me
Henchard signified dubiousness
Though he had so lately hoped that ElizabethJane might again live in his house as daughter he would not ask her to do so now
Newson might return at any moment and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her
When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work
Then she arose and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight
At this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking
Yet before the evening probably he will have come and then she will scorn me
This reflection constantly repeated by Henchard to himself accompanied him everywhere through the day
His mood was no longer that of the rebellious ironical reckless misadventurer but the leaden gloom of one who has lost all that can make life interesting or even tolerable
There would remain nobody for him to be proud of nobody to fortify him for ElizabethJane would soon be but as a stranger and worse
Susan Farfrae Lucetta Elizabeth all had gone from him one after one either by his fault or by his misfortune
In place of them he had no interest hobby or desire
If he could have summoned music to his aid his existence might even now have been borne for with Henchard music was of regal power
The merest trumpet or organ tone was enough to move him and high harmonies transubstantiated him
But hard fate had ordained that he should be unable to call up this Divine spirit in his need
The whole land ahead of him was as darkness itself there was nothing to come nothing to wait for
Yet in the natural course of life he might possibly have to linger on earth another thirty or forty yearsscoffed at at best pitied
The thought of it was unendurable
To the east of Casterbridge lay moors and meadows through which much water flowed
The wanderer in this direction who should stand still for a few moments on a quiet night might hear singular symphonies from these waters as from a lampless orchestra all playing in their sundry tones from near and far parts of the moor
At a hole in a rotten weir they executed a recitative where a tributary brook fell over a stone breastwork they trilled cheerily under an arch they performed a metallic cymballing and at Durnover Hole they hissed
The spot at which their instrumentation rose loudest was a place called Ten Hatches whence during high springs there proceeded a very fugue of sounds
The river here was deep and strong at all times and the hatches on this account were raised and lowered by cogs and a winch
A patch led from the second bridge over the highway so often mentioned to these Hatches crossing the stream at their head by a narrow plankbridge
But after nightfall human beings were seldom found going that way the path leading only to a deep reach of the stream called Blackwater and the passage being dangerous
Henchard however leaving the town by the east road proceeded to the second or stone bridge and thence struck into this path of solitude following its course beside the stream till the dark shapes of the Ten Hatches cut the sheen thrown upon the river by the weak lustre that still lingered in the west
In a second or two he stood beside the weir hole where the water was at its deepest
He looked backwards and forwards and no creature appeared in view
He then took off his coat and hat and stood on the brink of the stream with his hands clasped in front of him
While his eyes were bent on the water beneath there slowly became visible a something floating in the circular pool formed by the wash of centuries the pool he was intending to make his deathbed
At first it was indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank but it emerged thence and took shape which was that of a human body lying stiff and stark upon the surface of the stream
In the circular current imparted by the central flow the form was brought forward till it passed under his eyes and then he perceived with a sense of horror that it was HIMSELF
Not a man somewhat resembling him but one in all respects his counterpart his actual double was floating as if dead in Ten Hatches Hole
The sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man and he turned away as one might have done in the actual presence of an appalling miracle
He covered his eyes and bowed his head
Without looking again into the stream he took his coat and hat and went slowly away
Presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling
To his surprise ElizabethJane was standing there
She came forward spoke called him father just as before
Newson then had not even yet returned
I thought you seemed very sad this morning she said so I have come again to see you
Not that I am anything but sad myself
But everybody and everything seem against you so and I know you must be suffering
How this woman divined things
Yet she had not divined their whole extremity
He said to her Are miracles still worked do ye think Elizabeth
I am not a read man
I dont know so much as I could wish
I have tried to peruse and learn all my life but the more I try to know the more ignorant I seem
I dont quite think there are any miracles nowadays she said
No interference in the case of desperate intentions for instance
Well perhaps not in a direct way
Perhaps not
But will you come and walk with me and I will show ee what I mean
She agreed willingly and he took her over the highway and by the lonely path to Ten Hatches
He walked restlessly as if some haunting shade unseen of her hovered round him and troubled his glance
She would gladly have talked of Lucetta but feared to disturb him
When they got near the weir he stood still and asked her to go forward and look into the pool and tell him what she saw
She went and soon returned to him
Nothing she said
Go again said Henchard and look narrowly
She proceeded to the river brink a second time
On her return after some delay she told him that she saw something floating round and round there but what it was she could not discern
It seemed to be a bundle of old clothes
Are they like mine
asked Henchard
Wellthey are
Dear meI wonder ifFather let us go away
Go and look once more and then we will get home
She went back and he could see her stoop till her head was close to the margin of the pool
She started up and hastened back to his side
Well said Henchard what do you say now
Let us go home
But tell medowhat is it floating there
The effigy she answered hastily
They must have thrown it into the river higher up amongst the willows at Blackwater to get rid of it in their alarm at discovery by the magistrates and it must have floated down here
Ahto be surethe image o me
But where is the other
Why that one onlyThat performance of theirs killed her but kept me alive
ElizabethJane thought and thought of these words kept me alive as they slowly retraced their way to the town and at length guessed their meaning
FatherI will not leave you alone like this
she cried
May I live with you and tend upon you as I used to do
I do not mind your being poor
I would have agreed to come this morning but you did not ask me
May you come to me
he cried bitterly
Elizabeth dont mock me
If you only would come
I will said she
How will you forgive all my roughness in former days
You cannot
I have forgotten it
Talk of that no more
Thus she assured him and arranged their plans for reunion and at length each went home
Then Henchard shaved for the first time during many days and put on clean linen and combed his hair and was as a man resuscitated thence forward
The next morning the fact turned out to be as ElizabethJane had stated the effigy was discovered by a cowherd and that of Lucetta a little higher up in the same stream
But as little as possible was said of the matter and the figures were privately destroyed
Despite this natural solution of the mystery Henchard no less regarded it as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there
ElizabethJane heard him say Who is such a reprobate as I
And yet it seems that even I be in Somebodys hand
42
But the emotional conviction that he was in Somebodys hand began to die out of Henchards breast as time slowly removed into distance the event which had given that feeling birth
The apparition of Newson haunted him
He would surely return
Yet Newson did not arrive
Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard path Casterbridge had for the last time turned its regard upon her before proceeding to its work as if she had never lived
But Elizabeth remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard and now shared his home
Perhaps after all Newson was gone for ever
In due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the at least proximate cause of Lucettas illness and death and his first impulse was naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the perpetrators of the mischief
He resolved to wait till the funeral was over ere he moved in the matter
The time having come he reflected
Disastrous as the result had been it was obviously in no way foreseen or intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession
The tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the head of affairsthat supreme and piquant enjoyment of those who writhe under the heel of the samehad alone animated them so far as he could see for he knew nothing of Jopps incitements
Other considerations were also involved
Lucetta had confessed everything to him before her death and it was not altogether desirable to make much ado about her history alike for her sake for Henchards and for his own
To regard the event as an untoward accident seemed to Farfrae truest consideration for the dead ones memory as well as best philosophy
Henchard and himself mutually forbore to meet
For Elizabeths sake the former had fettered his pride sufficiently to accept the small seed and root business which some of the Town Council headed by Farfrae had purchased to afford him a new opening
Had he been only personally concerned Henchard without doubt would have declined assistance even remotely brought about by the man whom he had so fiercely assailed
But the sympathy of the girl seemed necessary to his very existence and on her account pride itself wore the garments of humility
Here they settled themselves and on each day of their lives Henchard anticipated her every wish with a watchfulness in which paternal regard was heightened by a burning jealous dread of rivalry
Yet that Newson would ever now return to Casterbridge to claim her as a daughter there was little reason to suppose
He was a wanderer and a stranger almost an alien he had not seen his daughter for several years his affection for her could not in the nature of things be keen other interests would probably soon obscure his recollections of her and prevent any such renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that she was still a creature of the present
To satisfy his conscience somewhat Henchard repeated to himself that the lie which had retained for him the coveted treasure had not been deliberately told to that end but had come from him as the last defiant word of a despair which took no thought of consequences
Furthermore he pleaded within himself that no Newson could love her as he loved her or would tend her to his lifes extremity as he was prepared to do cheerfully
Thus they lived on in the shop overlooking the churchyard and nothing occurred to mark their days during the remainder of the year
Going out but seldom and never on a market day they saw Donald Farfrae only at rarest intervals and then mostly as a transitory object in the distance of the street
Yet he was pursuing his ordinary avocations smiling mechanically to fellowtradesmen and arguing with bargainersas bereaved men do after a while
Time in his own grey style taught Farfrae how to estimate his experience of Lucettaall that it was and all that it was not
There are men whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or cause thrown by chance into their keeping long after their judgment has pronounced it no rarityeven the reverse indeed and without them the band of the worthy is incomplete
But Farfrae was not of those
It was inevitable that the insight briskness and rapidity of his nature should take him out of the dead blank which his loss threw about him
He could not but perceive that by the death of Lucetta he had exchanged a looming misery for a simple sorrow
After that revelation of her history which must have come sooner or later in any circumstances it was hard to believe that life with her would have been productive of further happiness
But as a memory nothwithstanding such conditions Lucettas image still lived on with him her weaknesses provoking only the gentlest criticism and her sufferings attenuating wrath at her concealments to a momentary spark now and then
By the end of a year Henchards little retail seed and grain shop not much larger than a cupboard had developed its trade considerably and the stepfather and daughter enjoyed much serenity in the pleasant sunny corner in which it stood
The quiet bearing of one who brimmed with an inner activity characterized ElizabethJane at this period
She took long walks into the country two or three times a week mostly in the direction of Budmouth
Sometimes it occurred to him that when she sat with him in the evening after those invigorating walks she was civil rather than affectionate and he was troubled one more bitter regret being added to those he had already experienced at having by his severe censorship frozen up her precious affection when originally offered
She had her own way in everything now
In going and coming in buying and selling her word was law
You have got a new muff Elizabeth he said to her one day quite humbly
Yes I bought it she said
He looked at it again as it lay on an adjoining table
The fur was of a glossy brown and though he was no judge of such articles he thought it seemed an unusually good one for her to possess
Rather costly I suppose my dear was it not
he hazarded
It was rather above my figure she said quietly
But it is not showy
O no said the netted lion anxious not to pique her in the least
Some little time after when the year had advanced into another spring he paused opposite her empty bedroom in passing it
He thought of the time when she had cleared out of his then large and handsome house in corn Street in consequence of his dislike and harshness and he had looked into her chamber in just the same way
The present room was much humbler but what struck him about it was the abundance of books lying everywhere
Their number and quality made the meagre furniture that supported them seem absurdly disproportionate
Some indeed many must have been recently purchased and though he encouraged her to buy in reason he had no notion that she indulged her innate passion so extensively in proportion to the narrowness of their income
For the first time he felt a little hurt by what he thought her extravagance and resolved to say a word to her about it
But before he had found the courage to speak an event happened which set his thoughts flying in quite another direction
The busy time of the seed trade was over and the quiet weeks that preceded the hayseason had comesetting their special stamp upon Casterbridge by thronging the market with wood rakes new waggons in yellow green and red formidable scythes and pitchforks of prong sufficient to skewer up a small family
Henchard contrary to his wont went out one Saturday afternoon towards the marketplace from a curious feeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his former triumphs
Farfrae to whom he was still a comparative stranger stood a few steps below the Corn Exchange doora usual position with him at this hourand he appeared lost in thought about something he was looking at a little way off
Henchards eyes followed Farfraes and he saw that the object of his gaze was no sampleshowing farmer but his own stepdaughter who had just come out of a shop over the way
She on her part was quite unconscious of his attention and in this was less fortunate than those young women whose very plumes like those of Junos bird are set with Argus eyes whenever possible admirers are within ken
Henchard went away thinking that perhaps there was nothing significant after all in Farfraes look at ElizabethJane at that juncture
Yet he could not forget that the Scotchman had once shown a tender interest in her of a fleeting kind
Thereupon promptly came to the surface that idiosyncrasy of Henchards which had ruled his courses from the beginning and had mainly made him what he was
Instead of thinking that a union between his cherished stepdaughter and the energetic thriving Donald was a thing to be desired for her good and his own he hated the very possibility
Time had been when such instinctive opposition would have taken shape in action
But he was not now the Henchard of former days
He schooled himself to accept her will in this as in other matters as absolute and unquestionable
He dreaded lest an antagonistic word should lose for him such regard as he had regained from her by his devotion feeling that to retain this under separation was better than to incur her dislike by keeping her near
But the mere thought of such separation fevered his spirit much and in the evening he said with the stillness of suspense Have you seen Mr Farfrae today Elizabeth
ElizabethJane started at the question and it was with some confusion that she replied No
Ohthats rightthats rightIt was only that I saw him in the street when we both were there
He was wondering if her embarrassment justified him in a new suspicionthat the long walks which she had latterly been taking that the new books which had so surprised him had anything to do with the young man
She did not enlighten him and lest silence should allow her to shape thoughts unfavourable to their present friendly relations he diverted the discourse into another channel
Henchard was by original make the last man to act stealthily for good or for evil
But the solicitus timor of his lovethe dependence upon Elizabeths regard into which he had declined or in another sense to which he had advanceddenaturalized him
He would often weigh and consider for hours together the meaning of such and such a deed or phrase of hers when a blunt settling question would formerly have been his first instinct
And now uneasy at the thought of a passion for Farfrae which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with himself he observed her going and coming more narrowly
There was nothing secret in ElizabethJanes movements beyond what habitual reserve induced and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they chanced to meet
Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth Road her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfraes emergence from corn Street for a twenty minutes blow on that rather windy highwayjust to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before sitting down to tea as he said
Henchard became aware of this by going to the Ring and screened by its enclosure keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet
His face assumed an expression of extreme anguish
Of her too he means to rob me
he whispered
But he has the right
I do not wish to interfere
The meeting in truth was of a very innocent kind and matters were by no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchards jealous grief inferred
Could he have heard such conversation as passed he would have been enlightened thus much HEYou like walking this way Miss Henchardand is it not so
uttered in his undulatory accents and with an appraising pondering gaze at her
SHEO yes
I have chosen this road latterly
I have no great reason for it
HEBut that may make a reason for others
SHE reddeningI dont know that
My reason however such as it is is that I wish to get a glimpse of the sea every day
HEIs it a secret why
SHE  reluctantly Yes
HE with the pathos of one of his native balladsAh I doubt there will be any good in secrets
A secret cast a deep shadow over my life
And well you know what it was
Elizabeth admitted that she did but she refrained from confessing why the sea attracted her
She could not herself account for it fully not knowing the secret possibly to be that in addition to early marine associations her blood was a sailors
Thank you for those new books Mr Farfrae she added shyly
I wonder if I ought to accept so many
Ay
why not
It gives me more pleasure to get them for you than you to have them
It cannot
They proceeded along the road together till they reached the town and their paths diverged
Henchard vowed that he would leave them to their own devices put nothing in the way of their courses whatever they might mean
If he were doomed to be bereft of her so it must be
In the situation which their marriage would create he could see no locus standi for himself at all
Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously his poverty ensured that no less than his past conduct
And so Elizabeth would grow to be a stranger to him and the end of his life would be friendless solitude
With such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness
Indeed within certain lines he had the right to keep an eye upon her as his charge
The meetings seemed to become matters of course with them on special days of the week
At last full proof was given him
He was standing behind a wall close to the place at which Farfrae encountered her
He heard the young man address her as Dearest Elizabeth Jane and then kiss her the girl looking quickly round to assure herself that nobody was near
When they were gone their way Henchard came out from the wall and mournfully followed them to Casterbridge
The chief looming trouble in this engagement had not decreased
Both Farfrae and ElizabethJane unlike the rest of the people must suppose Elizabeth to be his actual daughter from his own assertion while he himself had the same belief and though Farfrae must have so far forgiven him as to have no objection to own him as a fatherinlaw intimate they could never be
Thus would the girl who was his only friend be withdrawn from him by degrees through her husbands influence and learn to despise him
Had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had rivalled cursed wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was broken Henchard would have said I am content
But content with the prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire
There is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned unsolicited and of noxious kind are sometimes allowed to wander for a moment prior to being sent off whence they came
One of these thoughts sailed into Henchards ken now
Suppose he were to communicate to Farfrae the fact that his betrothed was not the child of Michael Henchard at all legally nobodys child how would that correct and leading townsman receive the information
He might possibly forsake ElizabethJane and then she would be her stepsires own again
Henchard shuddered and exclaimed God forbid such a thing
Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil when I try so hard to keep him away
43
What Henchard saw thus early was naturally enough seen at a little later date by other people
That Mr Farfrae walked with that bankrupt Henchards stepdaughter of all women became a common topic in the town the simple perambulating term being used hereabout to signify a wooing and the nineteen superior young ladies of Casterbridge who had each looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the merchant Councilman happy indignantly left off going to the church Farfrae attended left off conscious mannerisms left off putting him in their prayers at night amongst their blood relations in short reverted to their normal courses
Perhaps the only inhabitants of the town to whom this looming choice of the Scotchmans gave unmixed satisfaction were the members of the philosophic party which included Longways Christopher Coney Billy Wills Mr Buzzford and the like
The Three Mariners having been years before the house in which they had witnessed the young man and womans first and humble appearance on the Casterbridge stage they took a kindly interest in their career not unconnected perhaps with visions of festive treatment at their hands hereafter
Mrs Stannidge having rolled into the large parlour one evening and said that it was a wonder such a man as Mr Farfrae a pillow of the town who might have chosen one of the daughters of the professional men or private residents should stoop so low Coney ventured to disagree with her
No maam no wonder at all
Tis she thats a stooping to hethats my opinion
A widow manwhose first wife was no credit to himwhat is it for a young perusing woman thats her own mistress and well liked
But as a neat patching up of things I see much good in it
When a man have put up a tomb of best marblestone to the other one as heve done and weeped his fill and thought it all over and said to hisself Tother took me in I knowed this one first shes a sensible piece for a partner and theres no faithful woman in high life nowwell he may do worse than not to take her if shes tenderinclined
Thus they talked at the Mariners
But we must guard against a too liberal use of the conventional declaration that a great sensation was caused by the prospective event that all the gossips tongues were set wagging thereby and so on even though such a declaration might lend some eclat to the career of our poor only heroine
When all has been said about busy rumourers a superficial and temporary thing is the interest of anybody in affairs which do not directly touch them
It would be a truer representation to say that Casterbridge ever excepting the nineteen young ladies looked up for a moment at the news and withdrawing its attention went on labouring and victualling bringing up its children and burying its dead without caring a tittle for Farfraes domestic plans
Not a hint of the matter was thrown out to her stepfather by Elizabeth herself or by Farfrae either
Reasoning on the cause of their reticence he concluded that estimating him by his past the throbbing pair were afraid to broach the subject and looked upon him as an irksome obstacle whom they would be heartily glad to get out of the way
Embittered as he was against society this moody view of himself took deeper and deeper hold of Henchard till the daily necessity of facing mankind and of them particularly ElizabethJane became wellnigh more than he could endure
His health declined he became morbidly sensitive
He wished he could escape those who did not want him and hide his head for ever
But what if he were mistaken in his views and there were no necessity that his own absolute separation from her should be involved in the incident of her marriage
He proceeded to draw a picture of the alternativehimself living like a fangless lion about the back rooms of a house in which his stepdaughter was mistress an inoffensive old man tenderly smiled on by Elizabeth and goodnaturedly tolerated by her husband
It was terrible to his pride to think of descending so low and yet for the girls sake he might put up with anything even from Farfrae even snubbings and masterful tonguescourgings
The privilege of being in the house she occupied would almost outweigh the personal humiliation
Whether this were a dim possibility or the reverse the courtshipwhich it evidently now washad an absorbing interest for him
Elizabeth as has been said often took her walks on the Budmouth Road and Farfrae as often made it convenient to create an accidental meeting with her there
Two miles out a quarter of a mile from the highway was the prehistoric fort called Mai Dun of huge dimensions and many ramparts within or upon whose enclosures a human being as seen from the road was but an insignificant speck
Hitherward Henchard often resorted glass in hand and scanned the hedgeless Viafor it was the original track laid out by the legions of the Empireto a distance of two or three miles his object being to read the progress of affairs between Farfrae and his charmer
One day Henchard was at this spot when a masculine figure came along the road from Budmouth and lingered
Applying his telescope to his eye Henchard expected that Farfraes features would be disclosed as usual
But the lenses revealed that today the man was not ElizabethJanes lover
It was one clothed as a merchant captain and as he turned in the scrutiny of the road he revealed his face
Henchard lived a lifetime the moment he saw it
The face was Newsons
Henchard dropped the glass and for some seconds made no other movement
Newson waited and Henchard waitedif that could be called a waiting which was a transfixture
But ElizabethJane did not come
Something or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that day
Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for varietys sake
But what did that amount to
She might be here to morrow and in any case Newson if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her would soon make his opportunity
Then he would tell her not only of his paternity but of the ruse by which he had been once sent away
Elizabeths strict nature would cause her for the first time to despise her stepfather would root out his image as that of an arch deceiver and Newson would reign in her heart in his stead
But Newson did not see anything of her that morning
Having stood still awhile he at last retraced his steps and Henchard felt like a condemned man who has a few hours respite
When he reached his own house he found her there
O father
she said innocently
I have had a lettera strange onenot signed
Somebody has asked me to meet him either on the Budmouth Road at noon today or in the evening at Mr Farfraes
He says he came to see me some time ago but a trick was played him so that he did not see me
I dont understand it but between you and me I think Donald is at the bottom of the mystery and that it is a relation of his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice
But I did not like to go till I had seen you
Shall I go
Henchard replied heavily Yes go
The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene
Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart
And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence and haughty withal he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions while immediately taking his measures
He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her as if he did not care about her more I am going to leave Casterbridge ElizabethJane
Leave Casterbridge
she cried and leaveme
Yes this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both I dont care about shops and streets and folkI would rather get into the country by myself out of sight and follow my own ways and leave you to yours
She looked down and her tears fell silently
It seemed to her that this resolve of his had come on account of her attachment and its probable result
She showed her devotion to Farfrae however by mastering her emotion and speaking out
I am sorry you have decided on this she said with difficult firmness
For I thought it probablepossible that I might marry Mr Farfrae some little time hence and I did not know that you disapproved of the step
I approve of anything you desire to do Izzy said Henchard huskily
If I did not approve it would be no matter
I wish to go away
My presence might make things awkward in the future and in short it is best that I go
Nothing that her affection could urge would induce him to reconsider his determination for she could not urge what she did not knowthat when she should learn he was not related to her other than as a stepparent she would refrain from despising him and that when she knew what he had done to keep her in ignorance she would refrain from hating him
It was his conviction that she would not so refrain and there existed as yet neither word nor event which could argue it away
Then she said at last you will not be able to come to my wedding and that is not as it ought to be
I dont want to see itI dont want to see it
he exclaimed adding more softly but think of me sometimes in your future lifeyoull do that Izzythink of me when you are living as the wife of the richest the foremost man in the town and dont let my sins WHEN YOU KNOW THEM ALL cause ee to quite forget that though I loved ee late I loved ee well
It is because of Donald
she sobbed
I dont forbid you to marry him said Henchard
Promise not to quite forget me when He meant when Newson should come
She promised mechanically in her agitation and the same evening at dusk Henchard left the town to whose development he had been one of the chief stimulants for many years
During the day he had bought a new toolbasket cleaned up his old hayknife and wimble set himself up in fresh leggings kneenaps and corduroys and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood discarding for ever the shabbygenteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days
He went secretly and alone not a soul of the many who had known him being aware of his departure
ElizabethJane accompanied him as far as the second bridge on the highway for the hour of her appointment with the unguessed visitor at Farfraes had not yet arrivedand parted from him with unfeigned wonder and sorrow keeping him back a minute or two before finally letting him go
She watched his form diminish across the moor the yellow rushbasket at his back moving up and down with each tread and the creases behind his knees coming and going alternately till she could no longer see them
Though she did not know it Henchard formed at this moment much the same picture as he had presented when entering Casterbridge for the first time nearly a quarter of a century before except to be sure that the serious addition to his years had considerably lessened the spring to his stride that his state of hopelessness had weakened him and imparted to his shoulders as weighted by the basket a perceptible bend
He went on till he came to the first milestone which stood in the bank half way up a steep hill
He rested his basket on the top of the stone placed his elbows on it and gave way to a convulsive twitch which was worse than a sob because it was so hard and so dry
If I had only got her with meif I only had
he said
Hard work would be nothing to me then
But that was not to be
ICaingo alone as I deservean outcast and a vagabond
But my punishment is not greater than I can bear
He sternly subdued his anguish shouldered his basket and went on
Elizabeth in the meantime had breathed him a sigh recovered her equanimity and turned her face to Casterbridge
Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae
This was evidently not their first meeting that day they joined hands without ceremony and Farfrae anxiously asked And is he gone and did you tell himI mean of the other matternot of ours
He is gone and I told him all I knew of your friend
Donald who is he
Well well dearie you will know soon about that
And Mr Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far
He will go farhes bent upon getting out of sight and sound
She walked beside her lover and when they reached the Crossways or Bow turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door
At Farfraes house they stopped and went in
Farfrae flung open the door of the groundfloor sitting room saying There he is waiting for you and Elizabeth entered
In the armchair sat the broadfaced genial man who had called on Henchard on a memorable morning between one and two years before this time and whom the latter had seen mount the coach and depart within halfanhour of his arrival
It was Richard Newson
The meeting with the lighthearted father from whom she had been separated half adozen years as if by death need hardly be detailed
It was an affecting one apart from the question of paternity
Henchards departure was in a moment explained
When the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed likely for Henchards conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true
Moreover she had grown up under Newsons paternal care and even had Henchard been her father in nature this father in early domiciliation might almost have carried the point against him when the incidents of her parting with Henchard had a little worn off
Newsons pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could express
He kissed her again and again
Ive saved you the trouble to come and meet mehaha
said Newson
The fact is that Mr Farfrae here he said Come up and stop with me for a day or two Captain Newson and Ill bring her round
Faith says I so I will and here I am
Well Henchard is gone said Farfrae shutting the door
He has done it all voluntarily and as I gather from Elizabeth he has been very nice with her
I was got rather uneasy but all is as it should be and we will have no more deefficulties at all
Now thats very much as I thought said Newson looking into the face of each by turns
I said to myself ay a hundred times when I tried to get a peep at her unknown to herselfDepend upon it tis best that I should live on quiet for a few days like this till something turns up for the better
I now know you are all right and what can I wish for more
Well Captain Newson I will be glad to see ye here every day now since it can do no harm said Farfrae
And what Ive been thinking is that the wedding may as well be kept under my own roof the house being large and you being in lodgings by yourselfso that a great deal of trouble and expense would be saved yeand tis a convenience when a couples married not to hae far to go to get home
With all my heart said Captain Newson since as ye say it can do no harm now poor Henchards gone though I wouldnt have done it otherwise or put myself in his way at all for Ive already in my lifetime been an intruder into his family quite as far as politeness can be expected to put up with
But what do the young woman say herself about it
Elizabeth my child come and hearken to what we be talking about and not bide staring out o the window as if ye didnt hear
Donald and you must settle it murmured Elizabeth still keeping up a scrutinizing gaze at some small object in the street
Well then continued Newson turning anew to Farfrae with a face expressing thorough entry into the subject thats how well have it
And Mr Farfrae as you provide so much and houseroom and all that Ill do my part in the drinkables and see to the rum and schiedammaybe a dozen jars will be sufficientas many of the folk will be ladies and perhaps they wont drink hard enough to make a high average in the reckoning
But you know best
Ive provided for men and shipmates times enough but Im as ignorant as a child how many glasses of grog a woman thats not a drinking woman is expected to consume at these ceremonies
Oh nonewell no want much of thatO no
said Farfrae shaking his head with appalled gravity
Do you leave all to me
When they had gone a little further in these particulars Newson leaning back in his chair and smiling reflectively at the ceiling said Ive never told ye or have I Mr Farfrae how Henchard put me off the scent that time
He expressed ignorance of what the Captain alluded to
Ah I thought I hadnt
I resolved that I would not I remember not to hurt the mans name
But now hes gone I can tell ye
Why I came to Casterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that I found ye out
I had been here twice before then
The first time I passed through the town on my way westward not knowing Elizabeth lived here
Then hearing at some placeI forget wherethat a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here I came back and called at his house one morning
The old rascalhe said ElizabethJane had died years ago
Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story
Now it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet contiued Newson
And if youll believe me I was that upset that I went back to the coach that had brought me and took passage onward without lying in the town half anhour
Hahatwas a good joke and well carried out and I give the man credit fort
ElizabethJane was amazed at the intelligence
A jokeO no
she cried
Then he kept you from me father all those months when you might have been here
The father admitted that such was the case
He ought not to have done it
said Farfrae
Elizabeth sighed
I said I would never forget him
But O
I think I ought to forget him now
Newson like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities failed to perceive the enormity of Henchards crime notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom
Indeed the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious he began to take Henchards part
Well twas not ten words that he said after all Newson pleaded
And how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him
Twas as much my fault as his poor fellow
No said ElizabethJane firmly in her revulsion of feeling
He knew your dispositionyou always were so trusting father Ive heard my mother say so hundreds of timesand he did it to wrong you
After weaning me from you these five years by saying he was my father he should not have done this
Thus they conversed and there was nobody to set before Elizabeth any extenuation of the absent ones deceit
Even had he been present Henchard might scarce have pleaded it so little did he value himself or his good name
Well wellnever mindit is all over and past said Newson goodnaturedly
Now about this wedding again
44
Meanwhile the man of their talk had pursued his solitary way eastward till weariness overtook him and he looked about for a place of rest
His heart was so exacerbated at parting from the girl that he could not face an inn or even a household of the most humble kind and entering a field he lay down under a wheatrick feeling no want of food
The very heaviness of his soul caused him to sleep profoundly
The bright autumn sun shining into his eyes across the stubble awoke him the next morning early
He opened his basket and ate for his breakfast what he had packed for his supper and in doing so overhauled the remainder of his kit
Although everything he brought necessitated carriage at his own back he had secreted among his tools a few of ElizabethJanes castoff belongings in the shape of gloves shoes a scrap of her handwriting and the like and in his pocket he carried a curl of her hair
Having looked at these things he closed them up again and went onward
During five consecutive days Henchards rush basket rode along upon his shoulder between the highway hedges the new yellow of the rushes catching the eye of an occasional fieldlabourer as he glanced through the quickset together with the wayfarers hat and head and downturned face over which the twig shadows moved in endless procession
It now became apparent that the direction of his journey was Weydon Priors which he reached on the afternoon of the sixth day
The renowned hill whereon the annual fair had been held for so many generations was now bare of human beings and almost of aught besides
A few sheep grazed thereabout but these ran off when Henchard halted upon the summit
He deposited his basket upon the turf and looked about with sad curiosity till he discovered the road by which his wife and himself had entered on the upland so memorable to both fiveandtwenty years before
Yes we came up that way he said after ascertaining his bearings
She was carrying the baby and I was reading a balletsheet
Then we crossed about hereshe so sad and weary and I speaking to her hardly at all because of my cursed pride and mortification at being poor
Then we saw the tentthat must have stood more this way
He walked to another spot it was not really where the tent had stood but it seemed so to him
Here we went in and here we sat down
I faced this way
Then I drank and committed my crime
It must have been just on that very pixyring that she was standing when she said her last words to me before going off with him I can hear their sound now and the sound of her sobs O Mike
Ive lived with thee all this while and had nothing but temper
Now Im no more to ee Ill try my luck elsewhere
He experienced not only the bitterness of a man who finds in looking back upon an ambitious course that what he has sacrificed in sentiment was worth as much as what he has gained in substance but the superadded bitterness of seeing his very recantation nullified
He had been sorry for all this long ago but his attempts to replace ambition by love had been as fully foiled as his ambition itself
His wronged wife had foiled them by a fraud so grandly simple as to be almost a virtue
It was an odd sequence that out of all this tampering with social law came that flower of Nature Elizabeth
Part of his wish to wash his hands of life arose from his perception of its contrarious inconsistenciesof Natures jaunty readiness to support unorthodox social principles
He intended to go on from this placevisited as an act of penanceinto another part of the country altogether
But he could not help thinking of Elizabeth and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived
Out of this it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of the world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for his stepdaughter
As a consequence instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge Henchard gradually almost unconsciously deflected from that right line of his first intention till by degrees his wandering like that of the Canadian woodsman became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre
In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun moon or stars and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and ElizabethJane lay
Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hournay every few minutesconjectured her actions for the time beingher sitting down and rising up her goings and comings till thought of Newsons and Farfraes counter influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool and efface her image
And then he would say to himself O you fool
All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine
At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of haytrusser work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time
The scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs
He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that situated here though at a distance of fifty miles he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote
And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he had occupied a quarter of a century before
Externally there was nothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope and by his new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half formed state had been able to accomplish
But the ingenious machinery contrived by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimumwhich arranges that wisdom to do shall come pari passu with the departure of zest for doingstood in the way of all that
He had no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere painted scene to him
Very often as his hayknife crunched down among the sweet smelling grassy stems he would survey mankind and say to himself Here and everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves though wanted by their families the country and the world while I an outcast an encumberer of the ground wanted by nobody and despised by all live on against my will
He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed along the roadnot from a general curiosity by any meansbut in the hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London some would sooner or later speak of the former place
The distance however was too great to lend much probability to his desire and the highest result of his attention to wayside words was that he did indeed hear the name Casterbridge uttered one day by the driver of a roadwaggon
Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in and hailed the speaker who was a stranger
YesIve come from there maister he said in answer to Henchards inquiry
I trade up and down ye know though what with this travelling without horses thats getting so common my work will soon be done
Anything moving in the old place mid I ask
All the same as usual
Ive heard that Mr Farfrae the late mayor is thinking of getting married
Now is that true or not
I couldnt say for the life o me
O no I should think not
But yes Johnyou forget said a woman inside the waggon tilt
What were them packages we carrd there at the beginning o the week
Surely they said a wedding was coming off soonon Martins Day
The man declared he remembered nothing about it and the waggon went on jangling over the hill
Henchard was convinced that the womans memory served her well
The date was an extremely probable one there being no reason for delay on either side
He might for that matter write and inquire of Elizabeth but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult
Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be
The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired
He had assumed the return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to return still less that ElizabethJane would welcome him and with no proof whatever that if he did return he would stay
What if he had been mistaken in his views if there had been no necessity that his own absolute separation from her he loved should be involved in these untoward incidents
To make one more attempt to be near her to go back to see her to plead his cause before her to ask forgiveness for his fraud to endeavour strenuously to hold his own in her love it was worth the risk of repulse ay of life itself
But how to initiate this reversal of all his former resolves without causing husband and wife to despise him for his inconsistency was a question which made him tremble and brood
He cut and cut his trusses two days more and then he concluded his hesitancies by a sudden reckless determination to go to the wedding festivity
Neither writing nor message would be expected of him
She had regretted his decision to be absenthis unanticipated presence would fill the little unsatisfied corner that would probably have place in her just heart without him
To intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event with which that personality could show nothing in keeping he decided not to make his appearance till evening when stiffness would have worn off and a gentle wish to let bygones be bygones would exercise its sway in all hearts
He started on foot two mornings before St Martinstide allowing himself about sixteen miles to perform for each of the three days journey reckoning the weddingday as one
There were only two towns Melchester and Shottsford of any importance along his course and at the latter he stopped on the second night not only to rest but to prepare himself for the next evening
Possessing no clothes but the working suit he stood innow stained and distorted by their two months of hard usage he entered a shop to make some purchases which should put him externally at any rate a little in harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow
A rough yet respectable coat and hat a new shirt and neckcloth were the chief of these and having satisfied himself that in appearance at least he would not now offend her he proceeded to the more interesting particular of buying her some present
What should that present be
He walked up and down the street regarding dubiously the display in the shop windows from a gloomy sense that what he might most like to give her would be beyond his miserable pocket
At length a caged goldfinch met his eye
The cage was a plain and small one the shop humble and on inquiry he concluded he could afford the modest sum asked
A sheet of newspaper was tied round the little creatures wire prison and with the wrapped up cage in his hand Henchard sought a lodging for the night
Next day he set out upon the last stage and was soon within the district which had been his dealing ground in bygone years
Part of the distance he travelled by carrier seating himself in the darkest corner at the back of that traders van and as the other passengers mainly women going short journeys mounted and alighted in front of Henchard they talked over much local news not the least portion of this being the wedding then in course of celebration at the town they were nearing
It appeared from their accounts that the town band had been hired for the evening party and lest the convivial instincts of that body should get the better of their skill the further step had been taken of engaging the string band from Budmouth so that there would be a reserve of harmony to fall back upon in case of need
He heard however but few particulars beyond those known to him already the incident of the deepest interest on the journey being the soft pealing of the Casterbridge bells which reached the travellers ears while the van paused on the top of Yalbury Hill to have the drag lowered
The time was just after twelve oclock
Those notes were a signal that all had gone well that there had been no slip twixt cup and lip in this case that ElizabethJane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife
Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound
Indeed it quite unmanned him and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride he alighted here with his bundle and birdcage and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway
It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae almost two years earlier to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta
The place was unchanged the same larches sighed the same notes but Farfrae had another wife and as Henchard knew a better one
He only hoped that ElizabethJane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time
He passed the remainder of the afternoon in a curious high strung condition unable to do much but think of the approaching meeting with her and sadly satirize himself for his emotions thereon as a Samson shorn
Such an innovation on Casterbridge customs as a flitting of bridegroom and bride from the town immediately after the ceremony was not likely but if it should have taken place he would wait till their return
To assure himself on this point he asked a marketman when near the borough if the newlymarried couple had gone away and was promptly informed that they had not they were at that hour according to all accounts entertaining a houseful of guests at their home in Corn Street
Henchard dusted his boots washed his hands at the riverside and proceeded up the town under the feeble lamps
He need have made no inquiries beforehand for on drawing near Farfraes residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within and that Donald himself shared it his voice being distinctly audible in the street giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it
Idlers were standing on the pavement in front and wishing to escape the notice of these Henchard passed quickly on to the door
It was wide open the hall was lighted extravagantly and people were going up and down the stairs
His courage failed him to enter footsore laden and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved if not to court repulse from her husband
Accordingly he went round into the street at the back that he knew so well entered the garden and came quietly into the house through the kitchen temporarily depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival
Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard that he now feared circumstances he would formerly have scorned and he began to wish that he had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture
However his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfraes establishment was just then suffering
She was one of those people whom nothing surprises and though to her a total stranger his request must have seemed odd she willingly volunteered to go up and inform the master and mistress of the house that a humble old friend had come
On second thought she said that he had better not wait in the kitchen but come up into the little backparlour which was empty
He thereupon followed her thither and she left him
Just as she got across the landing to the door of the best parlour a dance was struck up and she returned to say that she would wait till that was over before announcing himMr and Mrs Farfrae having both joined in the figure
The door of the front room had been taken off its hinges to give more space and that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar he could see fractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them near the doorway chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and streaming curls of hair together with about threefifths of the band in profile including the restless shadow of a fiddlers elbow and the tip of the bassviol bow
The gaiety jarred upon Henchards spirits and he could not quite understand why Farfrae a muchsobered man and a widower who had had his trials should have cared for it all notwithstanding the fact that he was quite a young man still and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by dance and song
That the quiet Elizabeth who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more
However young people could not be quite old people he concluded and custom was omnipotent
With the progress of the dance the performers spread out somewhat and then for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised daughter who had mastered him and made his heart ache
She was in a dress of white silk or satin he was not near enough to say whichsnowy white without a tinge of milk or cream and the expression of her face was one of nervous pleasure rather than of gaiety
Presently Farfrae came round his exuberant Scotch movement making him conspicuous in a moment
The pair were not dancing together but Henchard could discern that whenever the chances of the figure made them the partners of a moment their emotions breathed a much subtler essence than at other times
By degrees Henchard became aware that the measure was trod by some one who outFarfraed Farfrae in saltatory intenseness
This was strange and it was stranger to find that the eclipsing personage was ElizabethJanes partner
The first time that Henchard saw him he was sweeping grandly round his head quivering and low down his legs in the form of an X and his back towards the door
The next time he came round in the other direction his white waistcoat preceding his face and his toes preceding his white waistcoat
That happy faceHenchards complete discomfiture lay in it
It was Newsons who had indeed come and supplanted him
Henchard pushed to the door and for some seconds made no other movement
He rose to his feet and stood like a dark ruin obscured by the shade from his own soul up thrown
But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved
His agitation was great and he would fain have been gone but before he could leave the dance had ended the housekeeper had informed ElizabethJane of the stranger who awaited her and she entered the room immediately
Ohit isMr
Henchard
she said starting back
What Elizabeth
he cried as she seized her hand
What do you sayMr
Henchard
Dont dont scourge me like that
Call me worthless old Henchardanythingbut dont ee be so cold as this
O my maidI see you have anothera real father in my place
Then you know all but dont give all your thought to him
Do ye save a little room for me
She flushed up and gently drew her hand away
I could have loved you alwaysI would have gladly she said
But how can I when I know you have deceived me soso bitterly deceived me
You persuaded me that my father was not my fatherallowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years and then when he my warmhearted real father came to find me cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death which nearly broke his heart
O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this
Henchards lips half parted to begin an explanation
But he shut them up like a vice and uttered not a sound
How should he there and then set before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faultsthat he had himself been deceived in her identity at first till informed by her mothers letter that his own child had died that in the second accusation his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who loved her affection better than his own honour
Among the many hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this that he did not sufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal or elaborate argument
Waiving therefore his privilege of selfdefence he regarded only his discomposure
Dont ye distress yourself on my account he said with proud superiority
I would not wish itat such a time too as this
I have done wrong in coming to eeI see my error
But it is only for once so forgive it
Ill never trouble ee again ElizabethJaneno not to my dying day
Goodnight
Good bye
Then before she could collect her thoughts Henchard went out from her rooms and departed from the house by the back way as he had come and she saw him no more
45
It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter
ElizabethJane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation and the only difference between Donalds movements now and formerly was that he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had been in the habit of doing for some time
Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party whose gaiety as might have been surmised was of his making rather than of the married couples and was stared at and honoured as became the returned Crusoe of the hour
But whether or not because Casterbridge was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through having been for centuries an assize town in which sensational exits from the world antipodean absences and such like were halfyearly occurrences the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity on his account
On the fourth morning he was discovered disconsolately climbing a hill in his craving to get a glimpse of the sea from somewhere or other
The contiguity of salt water proved to be such a necessity of his existence that he preferred Budmouth as a place of residence notwithstanding the society of his daughter in the other town
Thither he went and settled in lodgings in a greenshuttered cottage which had a bowwindow jutting out sufficiently to afford glimpses of a vertical strip of blue sea to any one opening the sash and leaning forward far enough to look through a narrow lane of tall intervening houses
ElizabethJane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour critically surveying some rearrangement of articles with her head to one side when the housemaid came in with the announcement Oh please maam we know now how that birdcage came there
In exploring her new domain during the first week of residence gazing with critical satisfaction on this cheerful room and that penetrating cautiously into dark cellars sallying forth with gingerly tread to the garden now leafstrewn by autumn winds and thus like a wise fieldmarshal estimating the capabilities of the site whereon she was about to open her housekeeping campaign Mrs Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new birdcage shrouded in newspaper and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathersthe dead body of a goldfinch
Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident
The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her
She had not been able to forget it for days despite Farfraes tender banter and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived
Oh please maam we know how the birdcage came there
That farmers man who called on the evening of the wedding he was seen wi it in his hand as he came up the street and tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message and then went away forgetting where he had left it
This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking and in thinking she seized hold of the idea at one feminine bound that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance
He had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done in the past but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing and live on as one of his own worst accusers
She went out looked at the cage buried the starved little singer and from that hour her heart softened towards the selfalienated man
When her husband came in she told him her solution of the birdcage mystery and begged Donald to help her in finding out as soon as possible whither Henchard had banished himself that she might make her peace with him try to do something to render his life less that of an outcast and more tolerable to him
Although Farfrae had never so passionately liked Henchard as Henchard had liked him he had on the other hand never so passionately hated in the same direction as his former friend had done and he was therefore not the least indisposed to assist ElizabethJane in her laudable plan
But it was by no means easy to set about discovering Henchard
He had apparently sunk into the earth on leaving Mr and Mrs Farfraes door
ElizabethJane remembered what he had once attempted and trembled
But though she did not know it Henchard had become a changed man since thenas far that is as change of emotional basis can justify such a radical phrase and she needed not to fear
In a few days Farfraes inquiries elicited that Henchard had been seen by one who knew him walking steadily along the Melchester highway eastward at twelve oclock at nightin other words retracing his steps on the road by which he had come
This was enough and the next morning Farfrae might have been discovered driving his gig out of Casterbridge in that direction ElizabethJane sitting beside him wrapped in a thick flat furthe victorine of the periodher complexion somewhat richer than formerly and an incipient matronly dignity which the serene Minervaeyes of one whose gestures beamed with mind made becoming settling on her face
Having herself arrived at a promising haven from at least the grosser troubles of her life her object was to place Henchard in some similar quietude before he should sink into that lower stage of existence which was only too possible to him now
After driving along the highway for a few miles they made further inquiries and learnt of a roadmender who had been working thereabouts for weeks that he had observed such a man at the time mentioned he had left the Melchester coachroad at Weatherbury by a forking highway which skirted the north of Egdon Heath
Into this road they directed the horses head and soon were bowling across that ancient country whose surface never had been stirred to a fingers depth save by the scratchings of rabbits since brushed by the feet of the earliest tribes
The tumuli these had left behind dun and shagged with heather jutted roundly into the sky from the uplands as though they were the full breasts of Diana Multimammia supinely extended there
They searched Egdon but found no Henchard
Farfrae drove onward and by the afternoon reached the neighbourhood of some extension of the heath to the north of Anglebury a prominent feature of which in the form of a blasted clump of firs on a summit of a hill they soon passed under
That the road they were following had up to this point been Henchards track on foot they were pretty certain but the ramifications which now began to reveal themselves in the route made further progress in the right direction a matter of pure guesswork and Donald strongly advised his wife to give up the search in person and trust to other means for obtaining news of her stepfather
They were now a score of miles at least from home but by resting the horse for a couple of hours at a village they had just traversed it would be possible to get back to Casterbridge that same day while to go much further afield would reduce them to the necessity of camping out for the night and that will make a hole in a sovereign said Farfrae
She pondered the position and agreed with him
He accordingly drew rein but before reversing their direction paused a moment and looked vaguely round upon the wide country which the elevated position disclosed
While they looked a solitary human form came from under the clump of trees and crossed ahead of them
The person was some labourer his gait was shambling his regard fixed in front of him as absolutely as if he wore blinkers and in his hand he carried a few sticks
Having crossed the road he descended into a ravine where a cottage revealed itself which he entered
If it were not so far away from Casterbridge I should say that must be poor Whittle
Tis just like him observed ElizabethJane
And it may be Whittle for hes never been to the yard these three weeks going away without saying any word at all and I owing him for two days work without knowing who to pay it to
The possibility led them to alight and at least make an inquiry at the cottage
Farfrae hitched the reins to the gatepost and they approached what was of humble dwellings surely the humblest
The walls built of kneaded clay originally faced with a trowel had been worn by years of rainwashings to a lumpy crumbling surface channelled and sunken from its plane its gray rents held together here and there by a leafy strap of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the purpose
The rafters were sunken and the thatch of the roof in ragged holes
Leaves from the fence had been blown into the corners of the doorway and lay there undisturbed
The door was ajar Farfrae knocked and he who stood before them was Whittle as they had conjectured
His face showed marks of deep sadness his eyes lighting on them with an unfocused gaze and he still held in his hand the few sticks he had been out to gather
As soon as he recognized them he started
What Abel Whittle is it that ye are heere
said Farfrae
Ay yes sir
You see he was kindlike to mother when she wer here below though a was rough to me
Who are you talking of
O sirMr Henchet
Didnt ye know it
Hes just gone about halfanhour ago by the sun for Ive got no watch to my name
Notdead
faltered ElizabethJane
Yes maam hes gone
He was kindlike to mother when she wer here below sending her the best shipcoal and hardly any ashes from it at all and taties and suchlike that were very needful to her
I seed en go down street on the night of your worshipfuls wedding to the lady at yer side and I thought he looked low and faltering
And I followed en over Greys Bridge and he turned and zeed me and said You go back
But I followed and he turned again and said Do you hear sir
Go back
But I zeed that he was low and I followed on still
Then a said Whittle what do ye follow me for when Ive told ye to go back all these times
And I said Because sir I see things be bad with ee and ye wer kindlike to mother if ye wer rough to me and I would fain be kindlike to you
Then he walked on and I followed and he never complained at me no more
We walked on like that all night and in the blue o the morning when twas hardly day I looked ahead o me and I zeed that he wambled and could hardly drag along
By the time we had got past here but I had seen that this house was empty as I went by and I got him to come back and I took down the boards from the windows and helped him inside
What Whittle he said and can ye really be such a poor fond fool as to care for such a wretch as I
Then I went on further and some neighbourly woodmen lent me a bed and a chair and a few other traps and we brought em here and made him as comfortable as we could
But he didnt gain strength for you see maam he couldnt eat no appetite at alland he got weaker and today he died
One of the neighbours have gone to get a man to measure him
Dear meis that so
said Farfrae
As for Elizabeth she said nothing
Upon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper with some writing upon it continued Abel Whittle
But not being a man o letters I cant read writing so I dont know what it is
I can get it and show ye
They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper
On it there was pencilled as follows MICHAEL HENCHARDS WILL That ElizabethJane Farfrae be not told of my death or made to grieve on account of me
 that I be not buryd in consecrated ground
 that no sexton be asked to toll the bell
 that nobody is wished to see my dead body
 that no murners walk behind me at my funeral
 that no flours be planted on my grave  that no man remember me
To this I put my name
MICHAEL HENCHARD What are we to do
said Donald when he had handed the paper to her
She could not answer distinctly
O Donald
she cried at last through her tears what bitterness lies there
O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last partingBut theres no altering so it must be
What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as far as practicable by ElizabethJane though less from a sense of the sacredness of last words as such than from her independent knowledge that the man who wrote them meant what he said
She knew the directions to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of and hence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure or her husband credit for large heartedness
All was over at last even her regrets for having misunderstood him on his last visit for not having searched him out sooner though these were deep and sharp for a good while
From this time forward ElizabethJane found herself in a latitude of calm weather kindly and grateful in itself and doubly so after the Capharnaum in which some of her preceding years had been spent
As the lively and sparkling emotions of her early married live cohered into an equable serenity the finer movements of her nature found scope in discovering to the narrowlived ones around her the secret as she had once learnt it of making limited opportunities endurable which she deemed to consist in the cunning enlargement by a species of microscopic treatment of those minute forms of satisfaction that offer themselves to everybody not in positive pain which thus handled have much of the same inspiring effect upon life as wider interests cursorily embraced
Her teaching had a reflex action upon herself insomuch that she thought she could perceive no great personal difference between being respected in the nether parts of Casterbridge and glorified at the uppermost end of the social world
Her position was indeed to a marked degree one that in the common phrase afforded much to be thankful for
That she was not demonstratively thankful was no fault of hers
Her experience had been of a kind to teach her rightly or wrongly that the doubtful honour of a brief transmit through a sorry world hardly called for effusiveness even when the path was suddenly irradiated at some halfway point by daybeams rich as hers
But her strong sense that neither she nor any human being deserved less than was given did not blind her to the fact that there were others receiving less who had deserved much more
And in being forced to class herself among the fortunate she did not cease to wonder at the persistence of the unforeseen when the one to whom such unbroken tranquility had been accorded in the adult stage was she whose youth had seemed to teach that happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain
