Holiday Romance by Charles Dickens Scanned and proofed by David Price ccx074coventryacuk HOLIDAY ROMANCE  IN FOUR PARTS PART I  INTRODUCTORY ROMANCE PROM THE PEN OF WILLIAM TINKLING ESQ
Aged eight
THIS beginningpart is not made out of anybodys head you know
Its real
You must believe this beginningpart more than what comes after else you wont understand how what comes after came to be written
You must believe it all but you must believe this most please
I am the editor of it
Bob Redforth hes my cousin and shaking the table on purpose wanted to be the editor of it but I said he shouldnt because he couldnt
HE has no idea of being an editor
Nettie Ashford is my bride
We were married in the righthand closet in the corner of the dancingschool where first we met with a ring a green one from Wilkingwaters toyshop
I owed for it out of my pocketmoney
When the rapturous ceremony was over we all four went up the lane and let off a cannon brought loaded in Bob Redforths waistcoatpocket to announce our nuptials
It flew right up when it went off and turned over
Next day Lieut Col Robin Redforth was united with similar ceremonies to Alice Rainbird
This time the cannon burst with a most terrific explosion and made a puppy bark
My peerless bride was at the period of which we now treat in captivity at Miss Grimmers
Drowvey and Grimmer is the partnership and opinion is divided which is the greatest beast
The lovely bride of the colonel was also immured in the dungeons of the same establishment
A vow was entered into between the colonel and myself that we would cut them out on the following Wednesday when walking two and two
Under the desperate circumstances of the case the active brain of the colonel combining with his lawless pursuit he is a pirate suggested an attack with fireworks
This however from motives of humanity was abandoned as too expensive
Lightly armed with a paperknife buttoned up under his jacket and waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane the colonel took command of me at two PM on the eventful and appointed day
He had drawn out the plan of attack on a piece of paper which was rolled up round a hoopstick
He showed it to me
My position and my fulllength portrait but my real ears dont stick out horizontal was behind a corner lamppost with written orders to remain there till I should see Miss Drowvey fall
The Drowvey who was to fall was the one in spectacles not the one with the large lavender bonnet
At that signal I was to rush forth seize my bride and fight my way to the lane
There a junction would be effected between myself and the colonel and putting our brides behind us between ourselves and the palings we were to conquer or die
The enemy appeared  approached
Waving his black flag the colonel attacked
Confusion ensued
Anxiously I awaited my signal but my signal came not
So far from falling the hated Drowvey in spectacles appeared to me to have muffled the colonels head in his outlawed banner and to be pitching into him with a parasol
The one in the lavender bonnet also performed prodigies of valour with her fists on his back
Seeing that all was for the moment lost I fought my desperate way hand to hand to the lane
Through taking the back road I was so fortunate as to meet nobody and arrived there uninterrupted
It seemed an age ere the colonel joined me
He had been to the jobbing tailors to be sewn up in several places and attributed our defeat to the refusal of the detested Drowvey to fall
Finding her so obstinate he had said to her Die recreant
but had found her no more open to reason on that point than the other
My blooming bride appeared accompanied by the colonels bride at the dancingschool next day
What
Was her face averted from me
Hah
Even so
With a look of scorn she put into my hand a bit of paper and took another partner
On the paper was pencilled Heavens
Can I write the word
Is my husband a cow
In the first bewilderment of my heated brain I tried to think what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal mentioned above
Vain were my endeavours
At the end of that dance I whispered the colonel to come into the cloakroom and I showed him the note
There is a syllable wanting said he with a gloomy brow
Hah
What syllable
was my inquiry
She asks can she write the word
And no you see she couldnt said the colonel pointing out the passage
And the word was
said I
Cow  cow  coward hissed the piratecolonel in my ear and gave me back the note
Feeling that I must for ever tread the earth a branded boy  person I mean  or that I must clear up my honour I demanded to be tried by a courtmartial
The colonel admitted my right to be tried
Some difficulty was found in composing the court on account of the Emperor of Frances aunt refusing to let him come out
He was to be the president
Ere yet we had appointed a substitute he made his escape over the backwall and stood among us a free monarch
The court was held on the grass by the pond
I recognised in a certain admiral among my judges my deadliest foe
A cocoanut had given rise to language that I could not brook but confiding in my innocence and also in the knowledge that the President of the United States who sat next him owed me a knife I braced myself for the ordeal
It was a solemn spectacle that court
Two executioners with pinafores reversed led me in
Under the shade of an umbrella I perceived my bride supported by the bride of the piratecolonel
The president having reproved a little female ensign for tittering on a matter of life or death called upon me to plead Coward or no coward guilty or not guilty
I pleaded in a firm tone No coward and not guilty
The little female ensign being again reproved by the president for misconduct mutinied left the court and threw stones
My implacable enemy the admiral conducted the case against me
The colonels bride was called to prove that I had remained behind the corner lamppost during the engagement
I might have been spared the anguish of my own brides being also made a witness to the same point but the admiral knew where to wound me
Be still my soul no matter
The colonel was then brought forward with his evidence
It was for this point that I had saved myself up as the turning point of my case
Shaking myself free of my guards  who had no business to hold me the stupids unless I was found guilty  I asked the colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier
Ere he could reply the President of the United States rose and informed the court that my foe the admiral had suggested Bravery and that prompting a witness wasnt fair
The president of the court immediately ordered the admirals mouth to be filled with leaves and tied up with string
I had the satisfaction of seeing the sentence carried into effect before the proceedings went further
I then took a paper from my trouserspocket and asked What do you consider Col Redford the first duty of a soldier
Is it obedience
It is said the colonel
Is that paper  please to look at it  in your hand
It is said the colonel
Is it a military sketch
It is said the colonel
Of an engagement
Quite so said the colonel
Of the late engagement
Of the late engagement
Please to describe it and then hand it to the president of the court
From that triumphant moment my sufferings and my dangers were at an end
The court rose up and jumped on discovering that I had strictly obeyed orders
My foe the admiral who though muzzled was malignant yet contrived to suggest that I was dishonoured by having quitted the field
But the colonel himself had done as much and gave his opinion upon his word and honour as a pirate that when all was lost the field might be quitted without disgrace
I was going to be found No coward and not guilty and my blooming bride was going to be publicly restored to my arms in a procession when an unlookedfor event disturbed the general rejoicing
This was no other than the Emperor of Frances aunt catching hold of his hair
The proceedings abruptly terminated and the court tumultuously dissolved
It was when the shades of the next evening but one were beginning to fall ere yet the silver beams of Luna touched the earth that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on the borders of the pond the now deserted scene of the day before yesterdays agonies and triumphs
On a nearer approach and by a practised eye these might have been identified as the forms of the piratecolonel with his bride and of the day before yesterdays gallant prisoner with his bride
On the beauteous faces of the Nymphs dejection sat enthroned
All four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking till at length the bride of the colonel poutingly observed Its of no use pretending any more and we had better give it up
Hah
exclaimed the pirate
Pretending
Dont go on like that you worry me returned his bride
The lovely bride of Tinkling echoed the incredible declaration
The two warriors exchanged stony glances
If said the bride of the piratecolonel grownup people WONT do what they ought to do and WILL put us out what comes of our pretending
We only get into scrapes said the bride of Tinkling
You know very well pursued the colonels bride that Miss Drowvey wouldnt fall
You complained of it yourself
And you know how disgracefully the courtmartial ended
As to our marriage would my people acknowledge it at home
Or would my people acknowledge ours
said the bride of Tinkling
Again the two warriors exchanged stony glances
If you knocked at the door and claimed me after you were told to go away said the colonels bride you would only have your hair pulled or your ears or your nose
If you persisted in ringing at the bell and claiming me said the bride of Tinkling to that gentleman you would have things dropped on your head from the window over the handle or you would be played upon by the gardenengine
And at your own homes resumed the bride of the colonel it would be just as bad
You would be sent to bed or something equally undignified
Again how would you support us
The piratecolonel replied in a courageous voice By rapine
But his bride retorted Suppose the grownup people wouldnt be rapined
Then said the colonel they should pay the penalty in blood
 But suppose they should object retorted his bride and wouldnt pay the penalty in blood or anything else
A mournful silence ensued
Then do you no longer love me Alice
asked the colonel
Redforth
I am ever thine returned his bride
Then do you no longer love me Nettie
asked the present writer
Tinkling
I am ever thine returned my bride
We all four embraced
Let me not be misunderstood by the giddy
The colonel embraced his own bride and I embraced mine
But two times two make four
Nettie and I said Alice mournfully have been considering our position
The grownup people are too strong for us
They make us ridiculous
Besides they have changed the times
William Tinklings baby brother was christened yesterday
What took place
Was any king present
Answer William
I said No unless disguised as Greatuncle Chopper
Any queen
There had been no queen that I knew of at our house
There might have been one in the kitchen but I didnt think so or the servants would have mentioned it
Any fairies
None that were visible
We had an idea among us I think said Alice with a melancholy smile we four that Miss Grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy and would come in at the christening with her crutchstick and give the child a bad gift
Was there anything of that sort
Answer William
I said that ma had said afterwards and so she had that Great uncle Choppers gift was a shabby one but she hadnt said a bad one
She had called it shabby electrotyped secondhand and below his income
It must be the grownup people who have changed all this said Alice
WE couldnt have changed it if we had been so inclined and we never should have been
Or perhaps Miss Grimmer IS a wicked fairy after all and wont act up to it because the grownup people have persuaded her not to
Either way they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected
Tyrants
muttered the piratecolonel
Nay my Redforth said Alice say not so
Call not names my Redforth or they will apply to pa Let em said the colonel
I do not care
Whos he
Tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted
What remains for us to do
Alice went on in her mild wise way
We must educate we must pretend in a new manner we must wait
The colonel clenched his teeth  four out in front and a piece of another and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentist despot but had escaped from his guards
How educate
How pretend in a new manner
How wait
Educate the grownup people replied Alice
We part tonight
Yes Redforth  for the colonel tucked up his cuffs  part to night
Let us in these next holidays now going to begin throw our thoughts into something educational for the grownup people hinting to them how things ought to be
Let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance you I and Nettie
William Tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer shall copy out
Is it agreed
The colonel answered sulkily I dont mind
He then asked How about pretending
We will pretend said Alice that we are children not that we are those grownup people who wont help us out as they ought and who understand us so badly
The colonel still much dissatisfied growled How about waiting
We will wait answered little Alice taking Netties hand in hers and looking up to the sky we will wait  ever constant and true  till the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out and nothing makes us ridiculous and the fairies have come back
We will wait  ever constant and true  till we are eighty ninety or one hundred
And then the fairies will send US children and we will help them out poor pretty little creatures if they pretend ever so much
So we will dear said Nettie Ashford taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her
And now if my husband will go and buy some cherries for us I have got some money
In the friendliest manner I invited the colonel to go with me but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind and then lying down on his stomach on the grass pulling it up and chewing it
When I came back however Alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety
As we sat under the willowtree and ate the cherries fair for Alice shared them out we played at being ninety
Nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back and it made her hobble and Alice sang a song in an old womans way but it was very pretty and we were all merry
At least I dont know about merry exactly but all comfortable
There was a most tremendous lot of cherries and Alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case to hold things
In it that night was a tiny wineglass
So Alice and Nettie said they would make some cherrywine to drink our love at parting
Each of us had a glassful and it was delicious and each of us drank the toast Our love at parting
The colonel drank his wine last and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly
Anyhow his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper that we should Cut em out still
How did he mean
I asked my lawless friend
Cut our brides out said the colonel and then cut our way without going down a single turning bang to the Spanish main
We might have tried it though I didnt think it would answer only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moonlight under the willowtree and that our pretty pretty wives were gone
We burst out crying
The colonel gave in second and came to first but he gave in strong
We were ashamed of our red eyes and hung about for halfanhour to whiten them
Likewise a piece of chalk round the rims I doing the colonels and he mine but afterwards found in the bedroom lookingglass not natural besides inflammation
Our conversation turned on being ninety
The colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soling and heeling but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father as he himself should so soon be ninety when he thought shoes would be more convenient
The colonel also told me with his hand upon his hip that he felt himself already getting on in life and turning rheumatic
And I told him the same
And when they said at our house at supper they are always bothering about something that I stooped I felt so glad
This is the end of the beginningpart that you were to believe most
PART II
 ROMANCE
FROM THE PEN OF MISS ALICE RAINBIRD Aged seven
THERE was once a king and he had a queen and he was the manliest of his sex and she was the loveliest of hers
The king was in his private profession under government
The queens father had been a medical man out of town
They had nineteen children and were always having more
Seventeen of these children took care of the baby and Alicia the eldest took care of them all
Their ages varied from seven years to seven months
Let us now resume our story
One day the king was going to the office when he stopped at the fishmongers to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail which the queen who was a careful housekeeper had requested him to send home
Mr Pickles the fishmonger said Certainly sir is there any other article
Goodmorning
The king went on towards the office in a melancholy mood for quarterday was such a long way off and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes
He had not proceeded far when Mr Pickless errandboy came running after him and said Sir you didnt notice the old lady in our shop
What old lady
inquired the king
I saw none
Now the king had not seen any old lady because this old lady had been invisible to him though visible to Mr Pickless boy
Probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner that if she had not been visible to him he would have spoilt her clothes
Just then the old lady came trotting up
She was dressed in shot silk of the richest quality smelling of dried lavender
King Watkins the First I believe
said the old lady
Watkins replied the king is my name
Papa if I am not mistaken of the beautiful Princess Alicia
said the old lady
And of eighteen other darlings replied the king
Listen
You are going to the office said the old lady
It instantly flashed upon the king that she must be a fairy or how could she know that
You are right said the old lady answering his thoughts
I am the good Fairy Grandmarina
Attend
When you return home to dinner politely invite the Princess Alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now
It may disagree with her said the king
The old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea that the king was quite alarmed and humbly begged her pardon
We hear a great deal too much about this thing disagreeing and that thing disagreeing said the old lady with the greatest contempt it was possible to express
Dont be greedy
I think you want it all yourself
The king hung his head under this reproof and said he wouldnt talk about things disagreeing any more
Be good then said the Fairy Grandmarina and dont
When the beautiful Princess Alicia consents to partake of the salmon  as I think she will  you will find she will leave a fishbone on her plate
Tell her to dry it and to rub it and to polish it till it shines like motherofpearl and to take care of it as a present from me
Is that all
asked the king
Dont be impatient sir returned the Fairy Grandmarina scolding him severely
Dont catch people short before they have done speaking
Just the way with you grownup persons
You are always doing it
The king again hung his head and said he wouldnt do so any more
Be good then said the Fairy Grandmarina and dont
Tell the Princess Alicia with my love that the fishbone is a magic present which can only be used once but that it will bring her that once whatever she wishes for PROVIDED SHE WISHES FOR IT AT THE RIGHT TIME
That is the message
Take care of it
The king was beginning Might I ask the reason
when the fairy became absolutely furious
WILL you be good sir
she exclaimed stamping her foot on the ground
The reason for this and the reason for that indeed
You are always wanting the reason
No reason
There
Hoity toity me
I am sick of your grownup reasons
The king was extremely frightened by the old ladys flying into such a passion and said he was very sorry to have offended her and he wouldnt ask for reasons any more
Be good then said the old lady and dont
With those words Grandmarina vanished and the king went on and on and on till he came to the office
There he wrote and wrote and wrote till it was time to go home again
Then he politely invited the Princess Alicia as the fairy had directed him to partake of the salmon
And when she had enjoyed it very much he saw the fishbone on her plate as the fairy had told him he would and he delivered the fairys message and the Princess Alicia took care to dry the bone and to rub it and to polish it till it shone like motherofpearl
And so when the queen was going to get up in the morning she said O dear me dear me my head my head
and then she fainted away
The Princess Alicia who happened to be looking in at the chamber door asking about breakfast was very much alarmed when she saw her royal mamma in this state and she rang the bell for Peggy which was the name of the lord chamberlain
But remembering where the smellingbottle was she climbed on a chair and got it and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside and held the smellingbottle to the queens nose and after that she jumped down and got some water and after that she jumped up again and wetted the queens forehead and in short when the lord chamberlain came in that dear old woman said to the little princess What a trot you are
I couldnt have done it better myself
But that was not the worst of the good queens illness
O no
She was very ill indeed for a long time
The Princess Alicia kept the seventeen young princes and princesses quiet and dressed and undressed and danced the baby and made the kettle boil and heated the soup and swept the hearth and poured out the medicine and nursed the queen and did all that ever she could and was as busy busy busy as busy could be for there were not many servants at that palace for three reasons because the king was short of money because a rise in his office never seemed to come and because quarterday was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars
But on the morning when the queen fainted away where was the magic fishbone
Why there it was in the Princess Alicias pocket
She had almost taken it out to bring the queen to life again when she put it back and looked for the smellingbottle
After the queen had come out of her swoon that morning and was dozing the Princess Alicia hurried upstairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers who was a duchess
People did suppose her to be a doll but she was really a duchess though nobody knew it except the princess
This most particular secret was the secret about the magic fish bone the history of which was well known to the duchess because the princess told her everything
The princess kneeled down by the bed on which the duchess was lying fulldressed and wide awake and whispered the secret to her
The duchess smiled and nodded
People might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded but she often did though nobody knew it except the princess
Then the Princess Alicia hurried downstairs again to keep watch in the queens room
She often kept watch by herself in the queens room but every evening while the illness lasted she sat there watching with the king
And every evening the king sat looking at her with a cross look wondering why she never brought out the magic fishbone
As often as she noticed this she ran up stairs whispered the secret to the duchess over again and said to the duchess besides They think we children never have a reason or a meaning
And the duchess though the most fashionable duchess that ever was heard of winked her eye
Alicia said the king one evening when she wished him good night
Yes papa
What is become of the magic fishbone
In my pocket papa
I thought you had lost it
O no papa
Or forgotten it
No indeed papa
And so another time the dreadful little snapping pugdog next door made a rush at one of the young princes as he stood on the steps coming home from school and terrified him out of his wits and he put his hand through a pane of glass and bled bled bled
When the seventeen other young princes and princesses saw him bleed bleed bleed they were terrified out of their wits too and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once
But the Princess Alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths one after another and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick queen
And then she put the wounded princes hand in a basin of fresh cold water while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirtyfour put down four and carry three eyes and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass and there were fortunately no bits of glass there
And then she said to two chubbylegged princes who were sturdy though small Bring me in the royal ragbag I must snip and stitch and cut and contrive
So these two young princes tugged at the royal ragbag and lugged it in and the Princess Alicia sat down on the floor with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived and made a bandage and put it on and it fitted beautifully and so when it was all done she saw the king her papa looking on by the door
Alicia
Yes papa
What have you been doing
Snipping stitching cutting and contriving papa
Where is the magic fishbone
In my pocket papa
I thought you had lost it
O no papa
Or forgotten it
No indeed papa
After that she ran upstairs to the duchess and told her what had passed and told her the secret over again and the duchess shook her flaxen curls and laughed with her rosy lips
Well
and so another time the baby fell under the grate
The seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs but the baby was not used to it yet and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye
The way the poor little darling came to tumble was that he was out of the Princess Alicias lap just as she was sitting in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her in front of the kitchenfire beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner and the way she came to be doing that was that the kings cook had run away that morning with her own true love who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier
Then the seventeen young princes and princesses who cried at everything that happened cried and roared
But the Princess Alicia who couldnt help crying a little herself quietly called to them to be still on account of not throwing back the queen upstairs who was fast getting well and said Hold your tongues you wicked little monkeys every one of you while I examine baby
Then she examined baby and found that he hadnt broken anything and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye and smoothed his poor dear face and he presently fell asleep in her arms
Then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses I am afraid to let him down yet lest he should wake and feel pain be good and you shall all be cooks
They jumped for joy when they heard that and began making themselves cooks caps out of old newspapers
So to one she gave the saltbox and to one she gave the barley and to one she gave the herbs and to one she gave the turnips and to one she gave the carrots and to one she gave the onions and to one she gave the spicebox till they were all cooks and all running about at work she sitting in the middle smothered in the great coarse apron nursing baby
By and by the broth was done and the baby woke up smiling like an angel and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a faroff corner to look at the Princess Alicia turning out the saucepanful of broth for fear as they were always getting into trouble they should get splashed and scalded
When the broth came tumbling out steaming beautifully and smelling like a nosegay good to eat they clapped their hands
That made the baby clap his hands and that and his looking as if he had a comic toothache made all the princes and princesses laugh
So the Princess Alicia said Laugh and be good and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks
That delighted the young princes and princesses and they ate up all the broth and washed up all the plates and dishes and cleared away and pushed the table into a corner and then they in their cooks caps and the Princess Alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby who forgot his swelled face and his black eye and crowed with joy
And so then once more the Princess Alicia saw King Watkins the First her father standing in the doorway looking on and he said What have you been doing Alicia
Cooking and contriving papa
What else have you been doing Alicia
Keeping the children lighthearted papa
Where is the magic fishbone Alicia
In my pocket papa
I thought you had lost it
O no papa
Or forgotten it
No indeed papa
The king then sighed so heavily and seemed so lowspirited and sat down so miserably leaning his head upon his hand and his elbow upon the kitchentable pushed away in the corner that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen and left him alone with the Princess Alicia and the angelic baby
What is the matter papa
I am dreadfully poor my child
Have you no money at all papa
None my child
Is there no way of getting any papa
No way said the king
I have tried very hard and I have tried all ways
When she heard those last words the Princess Alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fishbone
Papa said she when we have tried very hard and tried all ways we must have done our very very best
No doubt Alicia
When we have done our very very best papa and that is not enough then I think the right time must have come for asking help of others
This was the very secret connected with the magic fishbone which she had found out for herself from the good Fairy Grandmarinas words and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend the duchess
So she took out of her pocket the magic fishbone that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like motherofpearl and she gave it one little kiss and wished it was quarterday
And immediately it WAS quarterday and the kings quarters salary came rattling down the chimney and bounced into the middle of the floor
But this was not half of what happened  no not a quarter for immediately afterwards the good Fairy Grandmarina came riding in in a carriage and four peacocks with Mr Pickless boy up behind dressed in silver and gold with a cockedhat powdered hair pink silk stockings a jewelled cane and a nosegay
Down jumped Mr Pickless boy with his cockedhat in his hand and wonderfully polite being entirely changed by enchantment and handed Grandmarina out and there she stood in her rich shotsilk smelling of dried lavender fanning herself with a sparkling fan
Alicia my dear said this charming old fairy how do you do
I hope I see you pretty well
Give me a kiss
The Princess Alicia embraced her and then Grandmarina turned to the king and said rather sharply Are you good
The king said he hoped so
I suppose you know the reason NOW why my goddaughter here kissing the princess again did not apply to the fishbone sooner
said the fairy
The king made a shy bow
Ah
but you didnt THEN
said the fairy
The king made a shyer bow
Any more reasons to ask for
said the fairy
The king said No and he was very sorry
Be good then said the fairy and live happy ever afterwards
Then Grandmarina waved her fan and the queen came in most splendidly dressed and the seventeen young princes and princesses no longer grown out of their clothes came in newly fitted out from top to toe with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out
After that the fairy tapped the Princess Alicia with her fan and the smothering coarse apron flew away and she appeared exquisitely dressed like a little bride with a wreath of orange flowers and a silver veil
After that the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass which was full of dresses of all sorts all for her and all exactly fitting her
After that the angelic baby came in running alone with his face and eye not a bit the worse but much the better
Then Grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess and when the duchess was brought down many compliments passed between them
A little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess and then the fairy said out loud Yes I thought she would have told you
Grandmarina then turned to the king and queen and said We are going in search of Prince Certainpersonio
The pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely
So she and the Princess Alicia got into the carriage and Mr Pickless boy handed in the duchess who sat by herself on the opposite seat and then Mr Pickless boy put up the steps and got up behind and the peacocks flew away with their tails behind
Prince Certainpersonio was sitting by himself eating barleysugar and waiting to be ninety
When he saw the peacocks followed by the carriage coming in at the window it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen
Prince said Grandmarina I bring you your bride
The moment the fairy said those words Prince Certainpersonios face left off being sticky and his jacket and corduroys changed to peachbloom velvet and his hair curled and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head
He got into the carriage by the fairys invitation and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess whom he had seen before
In the church were the princes relations and friends and the Princess Alicias relations and friends and the seventeen princes and princesses and the baby and a crowd of the neighbours
The marriage was beautiful beyond expression
The duchess was bridesmaid and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit where she was supported by the cushion of the desk
Grandmarina gave a magnificent weddingfeast afterwards in which there was everything and more to eat and everything and more to drink
The weddingcake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons frosted silver and white lilies and was fortytwo yards round
When Grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple and Prince Certainpersonio had made a speech and everybody had cried Hip hip hip hurrah
Grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarterdays in every year except in leapyear when there would be ten
She then turned to Certainpersonio and Alicia and said My dears you will have thirtyfive children and they will all be good and beautiful
Seventeen of your children will be boys and eighteen will be girls
The hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally
They will never have the measles and will have recovered from the whoopingcough before being born
On hearing such good news everybody cried out Hip hip hip hurrah
again
It only remains said Grandmarina in conclusion to make an end of the fishbone
So she took it from the hand of the Princess Alicia and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug dog next door and choked him and he expired in convulsions
PART III
 ROMANCE
FROM THE PEN OF LIEUTCOL ROBIN REDFORTH Aged nine
THE subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age
We find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the muzzle ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday
It seems that our hero considering himself spited by a Latin grammar master demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another
 Not getting it he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company bought a secondhand pocket pistol folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag made a bottle of Spanish liquoricewater and entered on a career of valour
It were tedious to follow Boldheart for such was his name through the commencing stages of his story
Suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of Capt
Boldheart reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearthrug spread out upon the quarterdeck of his schooner The Beauty in the China seas
It was a lovely evening and as his crew lay grouped about him he favoured them with the following melody O landsmen are folly
O pirates are jolly
O diddleum Dolly Di
CHORUS
 Heave yo
The soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of Boldheart may be more easily conceived than described
It was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave the word Whales
All was now activity
Where away
cried Capt
Boldheart starting up
On the larboard bow sir replied the fellow at the masthead touching his hat
For such was the height of discipline on board of The Beauty that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head
This adventure belongs to me said Boldheart
Boy my harpoon
Let no man follow and leaping alone into his boat the captain rowed with admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster
All was now excitement
He nears him
said an elderly seaman following the captain through his spyglass
He strikes him
said another seaman a mere stripling but also with a spyglass
He tows him towards us
said another seaman a man in the full vigour of life but also with a spyglass
In fact the captain was seen approaching with the huge bulk following
We will not dwell on the deafening cries of Boldheart
Boldheart
with which he was received when carelessly leaping on the quarterdeck he presented his prize to his men
They afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it
Ordering the sail to be braced up the captain now stood WNW
The Beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters
Nothing particular occurred for a fortnight except taking with considerable slaughter four Spanish galleons and a snow from South America all richly laden
Inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men
Capt
Boldheart called all hands aft and said My lads I hear there are discontented ones among ye
Let any such stand forth
After some murmuring in which the expressions Ay ay sir
Union Jack Avast Starboard Port Bowsprit and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent though subdued were audible Bill Boozey captain of the foretop came out from the rest
His form was that of a giant but he quailed under the captains eye
What are your wrongs
said the captain
Why dye see Capt
Boldheart replied the towering manner Ive sailed man and boy for many a year but I never yet knowd the milk served out for the ships companys teas to be so sour as tis aboard this craft
At this moment the thrilling cry Man overboard
announced to the astonished crew that Boozey in stepping back as the captain in mere thoughtfulness laid his hand upon the faithful pocketpistol which he wore in his belt had lost his balance and was struggling with the foaming tide
All was now stupefaction
But with Capt
Boldheart to throw off his uniform coat regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant was the work of a moment
Maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of The Beauty
And from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones Capt
Boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as William Boozey
Boldheart now pointed to the horizon and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort
She shall be ours at sunrise said he
Serve out a double allowance of grog and prepare for action
All was now preparation
When morning dawned after a sleepless night it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle
As the two ships came nearer to each other the stranger fired a gun and hoisted Roman colours
Boldheart then perceived her to be the Latingrammar masters bark
Such indeed she was and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit from the time of his first taking to a roving life
Boldheart now addressed his men promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it and giving orders that the Latingrammar master should be taken alive
He then dismissed them to their quarters and the fight began with a broadside from The Beauty
She then veered around and poured in another
The Scorpion so was the bark of the Latingrammar master appropriately called was not slow to return her fire and a terrific cannonading ensued in which the guns of The Beauty did tremendous execution
The Latingrammar master was seen upon the poop in the midst of the smoke and fire encouraging his men
To do him justice he was no craven though his white hat his short gray trousers and his long snuffcoloured surtout reaching to his heels the selfsame coat in which he had spited Boldheart contrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter
At this moment Boldheart seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men gave the word to board
A desperate conflict ensued in the hammocknettings  or somewhere in about that direction  until the Latingrammar master having all his masts gone his hull and rigging shot through and seeing Boldheart slashing a path towards him hauled down his flag himself gave up his sword to Boldheart and asked for quarter
Scarce had he been put into the captains boat ere The Scorpion went down with all on board
On Capt
Boldhearts now assembling his men a circumstance occurred
He found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook who having lost his brother in the late action was making at the Latingrammar master in an infuriated state intent on his destruction with a carvingknife
Capt
Boldheart then turned to the Latingrammar master severely reproaching him with his perfidy and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved
They answered with one voice Death
It may be so said the captain but it shall never be said that Boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy
Prepare the cutter
The cutter was immediately prepared
Without taking your life said the captain I must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys
I shall turn you adrift in this boat
You will find in her two oars a compass a bottle of rum a small cask of water a piece of pork a bag of biscuit and my Latin grammar
Go
and spite the natives if you can find any
Deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter and was soon left far behind
He made no effort to row but was seen lying on his back with his legs up when last made out by the ships telescopes
A stiff breeze now beginning to blow Capt
Boldheart gave orders to keep her SSW easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two W by W or even by WS if she complained much
He then retired for the night having in truth much need of repose
In addition to the fatigues he had undergone this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement but had not mentioned it
In the morning a white squall came on and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours
It thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks
Hurricanes then set in for two months
Waterspouts and tornadoes followed
The oldest sailor on board  and he was a very old one  had never seen such weather
The Beauty lost all idea where she was and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold
Everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day
Provisions now ran very low
Our hero put the crew on short allowance and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship
But his spirit kept him fat
In this extremity the gratitude of Boozey the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember was truly affecting
The loving though lowly William repeatedly requested to be killed and preserved for the captains table
We now approach a change of affairs
One day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated the man at the masthead  too weak now to touch his hat besides its having been blown away  called out Savages
All was now expectation
Presently fifteen hundred canoes each paddled by twenty savages were seen advancing in excellent order
They were of a light green colour the savages were and sang with great energy the following strain Choo a choo a choo tooth
Muntch muntch
Nycey
Choo a choo a choo tooth
Muntch muntch
Nycey
As the shades of night were by this time closing in these expressions were supposed to embody this simple peoples views of the evening hymn
But it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of For what we are going to receive c The chief imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot no sooner understood he understood English perfectly that the ship was The Beauty Capt
Boldheart than he fell upon his face on the deck and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up and told him he wouldnt hurt him
All the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror and had also to be lifted up one by one
Thus the fame of the great Boldheart had gone before him even among these children of Nature
Turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal
After dinner the chief told Capt
Boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there
Apprehensive of treachery Boldheart ordered his boats crew to attend him completely armed
And well were it for other commanders if their precautions  but let us not anticipate
When the canoes arrived at the beach the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire
Ordering his boats crew with the intrepid though illiterate William at their head to keep close and be upon their guard Boldheart bravely went on arm in arm with the chief
But how to depict the captains surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of For what we are going to receive c which has been given above and dancing hand in hand round the Latingrammar master in a hamper with his head shaved while two savages floured him before putting him to the fire to be cooked
Boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted
In the mean time the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered
On the generous Boldhearts proposal it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked but should be allowed to remain raw on two conditions namely 1
That he should never under any circumstances presume to teach any boy anything any more
2
That if taken back to England he should pass his life in travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done and should do their exercises for those boys for nothing and never say a word about it
Drawing the sword from its sheath Boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade
The prisoner wept bitterly and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career
The captain then ordered his boats crew to make ready for a volley and after firing to reload quickly
And expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels murmured William Boozey for Im alooking at ye
With those words the derisive though deadly William took a good aim
Fire
The ringing voice of Boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages
Volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes
Hundreds of savages were killed hundreds wounded and thousands ran howling into the woods
The Latin grammar master had a spare nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before
He presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance and serve him right
We now find Capt
Boldheart with this rescued wretch on board standing off for other islands
At one of these not a cannibal island but a pork and vegetable one he married only in fun on his part the kings daughter
Here he rested some time receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones gold dust elephants teeth and sandal wood and getting very rich
This too though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men
The ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things Boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor and turn The Beautys head towards England
These orders were obeyed with three cheers and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile William
We next find Capt
Boldheart about three leagues off Madeira surveying through his spyglass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him
On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to she ran up a flag which he instantly recognised as the flag from the mast in the backgarden at home
Inferring from this that his father had put to sea to seek his longlost son the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to inquire if this was so and if so whether his fathers intentions were strictly honourable
The boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat and reported that the stranger was The Family of twelve hundred tons and had not only the captains father on board but also his mother with the majority of his aunts and uncles and all his cousins
It was further reported to Boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them
Boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board The Beauty and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day
It was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the Latingrammar master
That thankless traitor was found out as the two ships lay near each other communicating with The Family by signals and offering to give up Boldheart
He was hanged at the yardarm the first thing in the morning after having it impressively pointed out to him by Boldheart that this was what spiters came to
The meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears
His uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too but he wasnt going to stand that
His cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform
He kindly conducted them round the vessel and pointed out everything worthy of notice
He also fired his hundred guns and found it amusing to witness their alarm
The entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning
Only one disagreeable incident occurred
Capt
Boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin Tom in irons for being disrespectful
On the boys promising amendment however he was humanely released after a few hours close confinement
Boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin and asked after the young lady with whom it was well known to the world he was in love
His mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at Margate for the benefit of seabathing it was the month of September but that she feared the young ladys friends were still opposed to the union
Boldheart at once resolved if necessary to bombard the town
Taking the command of his ship with this intention and putting all but fighting men on board The Family with orders to that vessel to keep in company Boldheart soon anchored in Margate Roads
Here he went ashore wellarmed and attended by his boats crew at their head the faithful though ferocious William and demanded to see the mayor who came out of his office
Dost know the name of yon ship mayor
asked Boldheart fiercely
No said the mayor rubbing his eyes which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor
She is named The Beauty said the captain
Hah
exclaimed the mayor with a start
And you then are Capt
Boldheart
The same
A pause ensued
The mayor trembled
Now mayor said the captain choose
Help me to my bride or be bombarded
The mayor begged for two hours grace in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady
Boldheart accorded him but one and during that one placed William Boozey sentry over him with a drawn sword and instructions to accompany him wherever he went and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false
At the end of the hour the mayor reappeared more dead than alive closely waited on by Boozey more alive than dead
Captain said the mayor I have ascertained that the young lady is going to bathe
Even now she waits her turn for a machine
The tide is low though rising
I in one of our townboats shall not be suspected
When she comes forth in her bathingdress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return
Do you the rest
Mayor returned Capt
Boldheart thou hast saved thy town
The captain then signalled his boat to take him off and steering her himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathingground and there to rest upon their oars
All happened as had been arranged
His lovely bride came forth the mayor glided in behind her she became confused and had floated out of her depth when with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boats crew her adoring Boldheart held her in his strong arms
There her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy
Before The Beauty could get under way the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour and the ringing of all the bells announced to the brave Boldheart that he had nothing to fear
He therefore determined to be married on the spot and signalled for a clergyman and clerk who came off promptly in a sailingboat named The Skylark
Another great entertainment was then given on board The Beauty in the midst of which the mayor was called out by a messenger
He returned with the news that government had sent down to know whether Capt
Boldheart in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a pirate would consent to be made a lieutenantcolonel
For himself he would have spurned the worthless boon but his bride wished it and he consented
Only one thing further happened before the good ship Family was dismissed with rich presents to all on board
It is painful to record but such is human nature in some cousins that Capt
Boldhearts unmannerly Cousin Tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a ropes end for cheekiness and making game when Capt
Boldhearts lady begged for him and he was spared
The Beauty then refitted and the captain and his bride departed for the Indian Ocean to enjoy themselves for evermore
PART IV
 ROMANCE FROM THE PEN OF MISS NETTIE ASHFORD Aged half past six
THERE is a country which I will show you when I get into maps where the children have everything their own way
It is a most delightful country to live in
The grownup people are obliged to obey the children and are never allowed to sit up to supper except on their birthdays
The children order them to make jam and jelly and marmalade and tarts and pies and puddings and all manner of pastry
If they say they wont they are put in the corner till they do
They are sometimes allowed to have some but when they have some they generally have powders given them afterwards
One of the inhabitants of this country a truly sweet young creature of the name of Mrs Orange had the misfortune to be sadly plagued by her numerous family
Her parents required a great deal of looking after and they had connections and companions who were scarcely ever out of mischief
So Mrs Orange said to herself I really cannot be troubled with these torments any longer I must put them all to school
Mrs Orange took off her pinafore and dressed herself very nicely and took up her baby and went out to call upon another lady of the name of Mrs
Lemon who kept a preparatory establishment
Mrs Orange stood upon the scraper to pull at the bell and give a ring tingting
Mrs
Lemons neat little housemaid pulling up her socks as she came along the passage answered the ringtingting
Goodmorning said Mrs Orange
Fine day
How do you do
Mrs
Lemon at home
Yes maam
Will you say Mrs Orange and baby
Yes maam
Walk in
Mrs Oranges baby was a very fine one and real wax all over
Mrs
Lemons baby was leather and bran
However when Mrs
Lemon came into the drawingroom with her baby in her arms Mrs Orange said politely Goodmorning
Fine day
How do you do
And how is little Tootleumboots
Well she is but poorly
Cutting her teeth maam said Mrs
Lemon
O indeed maam
said Mrs Orange
No fits I hope
No maam
How many teeth has she maam
Five maam
My Emilia maam has eight said Mrs Orange
Shall we lay them on the mantelpiece side by side while we converse
By all means maam said Mrs
Lemon
Hem
The first question is maam said Mrs Orange I dont bore you
Not in the least maam said Mrs
Lemon
Far from it I assure you
Then pray HAVE you said Mrs Orange  HAVE you any vacancies
Yes maam
How many might you require
Why the truth is maam said Mrs Orange I have come to the conclusion that my children  O I forgot to say that they call the grownup people children in that country
 that my children are getting positively too much for me
Let me see
Two parents two intimate friends of theirs one godfather two godmothers and an aunt
HAVE you as many as eight vacancies
I have just eight maam said Mrs
Lemon
Most fortunate
Terms moderate I think
Very moderate maam
Diet good I believe
Excellent maam
Unlimited
Unlimited
Most satisfactory
Corporal punishment dispensed with
Why we do occasionally shake said Mrs
Lemon and we have slapped
But only in extreme cases
COULD I maam said Mrs Orange  COULD I see the establishment
With the greatest of pleasure maam said Mrs
Lemon
Mrs
Lemon took Mrs Orange into the schoolroom where there were a number of pupils
Stand up children said Mrs
Lemon and they all stood up
Mrs Orange whispered to Mrs
Lemon There is a pale bald child with red whiskers in disgrace
Might I ask what he has done
Come here White said Mrs
Lemon and tell this lady what you have been doing
Betting on horses said White sulkily
Are you sorry for it you naughty child
said Mrs
Lemon
No said White
Sorry to lose but shouldnt be sorry to win
Theres a vicious boy for you maam said Mrs
Lemon
Go along with you sir
This is Brown Mrs Orange
O a sad case Browns
Never knows when he has had enough
Greedy
How is your gout sir
Bad said Brown
What else can you expect
said Mrs
Lemon
Your stomach is the size of two
Go and take exercise directly
Mrs Black come here to me
Now here is a child Mrs Orange maam who is always at play
She cant be kept at home a single day together always gadding about and spoiling her clothes
Play play play play from morning to night and to morning again
How can she expect to improve
Dont expect to improve sulked Mrs Black
Dont want to
There is a specimen of her temper maam said Mrs
Lemon
To see her when she is tearing about neglecting everything else you would suppose her to be at least goodhumoured
But bless you
maam she is as pert and flouncing a minx as ever you met with in all your days
You must have a great deal of trouble with them maam said Mrs Orange
Ah I have indeed maam
said Mrs
Lemon
What with their tempers what with their quarrels what with their never knowing whats good for them and what with their always wanting to domineer deliver me from these unreasonable children
Well I wish you goodmorning maam said Mrs Orange
Well I wish you goodmorning maam said Mrs
Lemon
So Mrs Orange took up her baby and went home and told the family that plagued her so that they were all going to be sent to school
They said they didnt want to go to school but she packed up their boxes and packed them off
O dear me dear me
Rest and be thankful
said Mrs Orange throwing herself back in her little armchair
Those troublesome troubles are got rid of please the pigs
Just then another lady named Mrs Alicumpaine came calling at the streetdoor with a ringtingting
My dear Mrs Alicumpaine said Mrs Orange how do you do
Pray stay to dinner
We have but a simple joint of sweetstuff followed by a plain dish of bread and treacle but if you will take us as you find us it will be SO kind
Dont mention it said Mrs Alicumpaine
I shall be too glad
But what do you think I have come for maam
Guess maam
I really cannot guess maam said Mrs Orange
Why I am going to have a small juvenile party tonight said Mrs Alicumpaine and if you and Mr Orange and baby would but join us we should be complete
More than charmed I am sure
said Mrs Orange
So kind of you
said Mrs Alicumpaine
But I hope the children wont bore you
Dear things
Not at all said Mrs Orange
I dote upon them
Mr Orange here came home from the city and he came too with a ringtingting
James love said Mrs Orange you look tired
What has been doing in the city today
Trap bat and ball my dear said Mr Orange and it knocks a man up
That dreadfully anxious city maam said Mrs Orange to Mrs Alicumpaine so wearing is it not
O so trying
said Mrs Alicumpaine
John has lately been speculating in the pegtop ring and I often say to him at night John IS the result worth the wear and tear
Dinner was ready by this time so they sat down to dinner and while Mr Orange carved the joint of sweetstuff he said Its a poor heart that never rejoices
Jane go down to the cellar and fetch a bottle of the Upest gingerbeer
At teatime Mr and Mrs Orange and baby and Mrs Alicumpaine went off to Mrs Alicumpaines house
The children had not come yet but the ballroom was ready for them decorated with paper flowers
How very sweet
said Mrs Orange
The dear things
How pleased they will be
I dont care for children myself said Mr Orange gaping
Not for girls
said Mrs Alicumpaine
Come
you care for girls
Mr Orange shook his head and gaped again
Frivolous and vain maam
My dear James cried Mrs Orange who had been peeping about do look here
Heres the supper for the darlings ready laid in the room behind the foldingdoors
Heres their little pickled salmon I do declare
And heres their little salad and their little roast beef and fowls and their little pastry and their wee wee wee champagne
Yes I thought it best maam said Mrs Alicumpaine that they should have their supper by themselves
Our table is in the corner here where the gentlemen can have their wineglass of negus and their eggsandwich and their quiet game at beggarmyneighbour and look on
As for us maam we shall have quite enough to do to manage the company
O indeed you may say so
Quite enough maam said Mrs Orange
The company began to come
The first of them was a stout boy with a white topknot and spectacles
The housemaid brought him in and said Compliments and at what time was he to be fetched
Mrs Alicumpaine said Not a moment later than ten
How do you do sir
Go and sit down
Then a number of other children came boys by themselves and girls by themselves and boys and girls together
They didnt behave at all well
Some of them looked through quizzingglasses at others and said Who are those
Dont know them
Some of them looked through quizzingglasses at others and said How do
Some of them had cups of tea or coffee handed to them by others and said Thanks much
A good many boys stood about and felt their shirtcollars
Four tiresome fat boys WOULD stand in the doorway and talk about the newspapers till Mrs Alicumpaine went to them and said My dears I really cannot allow you to prevent people from coming in
I shall be truly sorry to do it but if you put yourself in everybodys way I must positively send you home
One boy with a beard and a large white waistcoat who stood straddling on the hearthrug warming his coattails WAS sent home
Highly incorrect my dear said Mrs Alicumpaine handing him out of the room and I cannot permit it
There was a childrens band  harp cornet and piano  and Mrs Alicumpaine and Mrs Orange bustled among the children to persuade them to take partners and dance
But they were so obstinate
For quite a long time they would not be persuaded to take partners and dance
Most of the boys said Thanks much
But not at present
And most of the rest of the boys said Thanks much
But never do
O these children are very wearing
said Mrs Alicumpaine to Mrs Orange
Dear things
I dote upon them but they ARE wearing said Mrs Orange to Mrs Alicumpaine
At last they did begin in a slow and melancholy way to slide about to the music though even then they wouldnt mind what they were told but would have this partner and wouldnt have that partner and showed temper about it
And they wouldnt smile  no not on any account they wouldnt but when the music stopped went round and round the room in dismal twos as if everybody else was dead
O its very hard indeed to get these vexing children to be entertained
said Mrs Alicumpaine to Mrs Orange
I dote upon the darlings but it is hard said Mrs Orange to Mrs Alicumpaine
They were trying children thats the truth
First they wouldnt sing when they were asked and then when everybody fully believed they wouldnt they would
If you serve us so any more my love said Mrs Alicumpaine to a tall child with a good deal of white back in mauve silk trimmed with lace it will be my painful privilege to offer you a bed and to send you to it immediately
The girls were so ridiculously dressed too that they were in rags before supper
How could the boys help treading on their trains
And yet when their trains were trodden on they often showed temper again and looked as black they did
However they all seemed to be pleased when Mrs Alicumpaine said Supper is ready children
And they went crowding and pushing in as if they had had dry bread for dinner
How are the children getting on
said Mr Orange to Mrs Orange when Mrs Orange came to look after baby
Mrs Orange had left baby on a shelf near Mr Orange while he played at beggarmy neighbour and had asked him to keep his eye upon her now and then
Most charmingly my dear
said Mrs Orange
So droll to see their little flirtations and jealousies
Do come and look
Much obliged to you my dear said Mr Orange but I dont care about children myself
So Mrs Orange having seen that baby was safe went back without Mr Orange to the room where the children were having supper
What are they doing now
said Mrs Orange to Mrs Alicumpaine
They are making speeches and playing at parliament said Mrs Alicumpaine to Mrs Orange
On hearing this Mrs Orange set off once more back again to Mr Orange and said James dear do come
The children are playing at parliament
Thank you my dear said Mr Orange but I dont care about parliament myself
So Mrs Orange went once again without Mr Orange to the room where the children were having supper to see them playing at parliament
And she found some of the boys crying Hear hear hear
while other boys cried No no
and others Question
Spoke
and all sorts of nonsense that ever you heard
Then one of those tiresome fat boys who had stopped the doorway told them he was on his legs as if they couldnt see that he wasnt on his head or on his anything else to explain and that with the permission of his honourable friend if he would allow him to call him so another tiresome boy bowed he would proceed to explain
Then he went on for a long time in a singsong whatever he meant did this troublesome fat boy about that he held in his hand a glass and about that he had come down to that house that night to discharge what he would call a public duty and about that on the present occasion he would lay his hand his other hand upon his heart and would tell honourable gentlemen that he was about to open the door to general approval
Then he opened the door by saying To our hostess
and everybody else said To our hostess
and then there were cheers
Then another tiresome boy started up in sing song and then half a dozen noisy and nonsensical boys at once
But at last Mrs Alicumpaine said I cannot have this din
Now children you have played at parliament very nicely but parliament gets tiresome after a little while and its time you left off for you will soon be fetched
After another dance with more tearing to rags than before supper they began to be fetched and you will be very glad to be told that the tiresome fat boy who had been on his legs was walked off first without any ceremony
When they were all gone poor Mrs Alicumpaine dropped upon a sofa and said to Mrs Orange These children will be the death of me at last maam  they will indeed
I quite adore them maam said Mrs Orange but they DO want variety
Mr Orange got his hat and Mrs Orange got her bonnet and her baby and they set out to walk home
They had to pass Mrs
Lemons preparatory establishment on their way
I wonder James dear said Mrs Orange looking up at the window whether the precious children are asleep
I dont care much whether they are or not myself said Mr Orange
James dear
You dote upon them you know said Mr Orange
Thats another thing
I do said Mrs Orange rapturously
O I DO
I dont said Mr Orange
But I was thinking James love said Mrs Orange pressing his arm whether our dear good kind Mrs
Lemon would like them to stay the holidays with her
If she was paid for it I daresay she would said Mr Orange
I adore them James said Mrs Orange but SUPPOSE we pay her then
This was what brought that country to such perfection and made it such a delightful place to live in
The grownup people that would be in other countries soon left off being allowed any holidays after Mr and Mrs Orange tried the experiment and the children that would be in other countries kept them at school as long as ever they lived and made them do whatever they were told
