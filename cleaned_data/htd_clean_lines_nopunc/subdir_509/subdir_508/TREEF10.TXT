BOOK I I Unexpected obstacle
Please dont come till thirtieth
Anna
All the way from Charing Cross to Dover the train had hammered the words of the telegram into George Darrows ears ringing every change of irony on its commonplace syllables rattling them out like a discharge of musketry letting them one by one drip slowly and coldly into his brain or shaking tossing transposing them like the dice in some game of the gods of malice and now as he emerged from his compartment at the pier and stood facing the wind swept platform and the angry sea beyond they leapt out at him as if from the crest of the waves stung and blinded him with a fresh fury of derision
Unexpected obstacle
Please dont come till thirtieth
Anna
She had put him off at the very last moment and for the second time put him off with all her sweet reasonableness and for one of her usual good reasonshe was certain that this reason like the other the visit of her husbands uncles widow would be good
But it was that very certainty which chilled him
The fact of her dealing so reasonably with their case shed an ironic light on the idea that there had been any exceptional warmth in the greeting she had given him after their twelve years apart
They had found each other again in London some three months previously at a dinner at the American Embassy and when she had caught sight of him her smile had been like a red rose pinned on her widows mourning
He still felt the throb of surprise with which among the stereotyped faces of the seasons diners he had come upon her unexpected face with the dark hair banded above grave eyes eyes in which he had recognized every little curve and shadow as he would have recognized after half a lifetime the details of a room he had played in as a child
And as in the plumed starred crowd she had stood out for him slender secluded and different so he had felt the instant their glances met that he as sharply detached himself for her
All that and more her smile had said had said not merely I remember but I remember just what you remember almost indeed as though her memory had aided his her glance flung back on their recaptured moment its morning brightness
Certainly when their distracted Ambassadresswith the cry Oh you know Mrs Leath
Thats perfect for General Farnham has failed mehad waved them together for the march to the diningroom Darrow had felt a slight pressure of the arm on his a pressure faintly but unmistakably emphasizing the exclamation Isnt it wonderfulIn Londonin the seasonin a mob
Little enough on the part of most women but it was a sign of Mrs Leaths quality that every movement every syllable told with her
Even in the old days as an intent grave eyed girl she had seldom misplaced her light strokes and Darrow on meeting her again had immediately felt how much finer and surer an instrument of expression she had become
Their evening together had been a long confirmation of this feeling
She had talked to him shyly yet frankly of what had happened to her during the years when they had so strangely failed to meet
She had told him of her marriage to Fraser Leath and of her subsequent life in France where her husbands mother left a widow in his youth had been remarried to the Marquis de Chantelle and where partly in consequence of this second union the son had permanently settled himself
She had spoken also with an intense eagerness of affection of her little girl Effie who was now nine years old and in a strain hardly less tender of Owen Leath the charming clever young stepson whom her husbands death had left to her care A porter stumbling against Darrows bags roused him to the fact that he still obstructed the platform inert and encumbering as his luggage
Crossing sir
Was he crossing
He really didnt know but for lack of any more compelling impulse he followed the porter to the luggage van singled out his property and turned to march behind it down the gangway
As the fierce wind shouldered him building up a crystal wall against his efforts he felt anew the derision of his case
Nasty weather to cross sir the porter threw back at him as they beat their way down the narrow walk to the pier
Nasty weather indeed but luckily as it had turned out there was no earthly reason why Darrow should cross
While he pushed on in the wake of his luggage his thoughts slipped back into the old groove
He had once or twice run across the man whom Anna Summers had preferred to him and since he had met her again he had been exercising his imagination on the picture of what her married life must have been
Her husband had struck him as a characteristic specimen of the kind of American as to whom one is not quite clear whether he lives in Europe in order to cultivate an art or cultivates an art as a pretext for living in Europe
Mr Leaths art was watercolour painting but he practised it furtively almost clandestinely with the disdain of a man of the world for anything bordering on the professional while he devoted himself more openly and with religious seriousness to the collection of enamelled snuffboxes
He was blond and welldressed with the physical distinction that comes from having a straight figure a thin nose and the habit of looking slightly disgustedas who should not in a world where authentic snuffboxes were growing daily harder to find and the market was flooded with flagrant forgeries
Darrow had often wondered what possibilities of communion there could have been between Mr Leath and his wife
Now he concluded that there had probably been none
Mrs Leaths words gave no hint of her husbands having failed to justify her choice but her very reticence betrayed her
She spoke of him with a kind of impersonal seriousness as if he had been a character in a novel or a figure in history and what she said sounded as though it had been learned by heart and slightly dulled by repetition
This fact immensely increased Darrows impression that his meeting with her had annihilated the intervening years
She who was always so elusive and inaccessible had grown suddenly communicative and kind had opened the doors of her past and tacitly left him to draw his own conclusions
As a result he had taken leave of her with the sense that he was a being singled out and privileged to whom she had entrusted something precious to keep
It was her happiness in their meeting that she had given him had frankly left him to do with as he willed and the frankness of the gesture doubled the beauty of the gift
Their next meeting had prolonged and deepened the impression
They had found each other again a few days later in an old country house full of books and pictures in the soft landscape of southern England
The presence of a large party with all its aimless and agitated displacements had served only to isolate the pair and give them at least to the young mans fancy a deeper feeling of communion and their days there had been like some musical prelude where the instruments breathing low seem to hold back the waves of sound that press against them
Mrs Leath on this occasion was no less kind than before but she contrived to make him understand that what was so inevitably coming was not to come too soon
It was not that she showed any hesitation as to the issue but rather that she seemed to wish not to miss any stage in the gradual reflowering of their intimacy
Darrow for his part was content to wait if she wished it
He remembered that once in America when she was a girl and he had gone to stay with her family in the country she had been out when he arrived and her mother had told him to look for her in the garden
She was not in the garden but beyond it he had seen her approaching down a long shady path
Without hastening her step she had smiled and signed to him to wait and charmed by the lights and shadows that played upon her as she moved and by the pleasure of watching her slow advance toward him he had obeyed her and stood still
And so she seemed now to be walking to him down the years the light and shade of old memories and new hopes playing variously on her and each step giving him the vision of a different grace
She did not waver or turn aside he knew she would come straight to where he stood but something in her eyes said Wait and again he obeyed and waited
On the fourth day an unexpected event threw out his calculations
Summoned to town by the arrival in England of her husbands mother she left without giving Darrow the chance he had counted on and he cursed himself for a dilatory blunderer
Still his disappointment was tempered by the certainty of being with her again before she left for France and they did in fact see each other in London
There however the atmosphere had changed with the conditions
He could not say that she avoided him or even that she was a shade less glad to see him but she was beset by family duties and as he thought a little too readily resigned to them
The Marquise de Chantelle as Darrow soon perceived had the same mild formidableness as the late Mr Leath a sort of insistent selfeffacement before which every one about her gave way
It was perhaps the shadow of this ladys presencepervasive even during her actual brief eclipses that subdued and silenced Mrs Leath
The latter was moreover preoccupied about her stepson who soon after receiving his degree at Harvard had been rescued from a stormy loveaffair and finally after some months of troubled drifting had yielded to his stepmothers counsel and gone up to Oxford for a year of supplementary study
Thither Mrs Leath went once or twice to visit him and her remaining days were packed with family obligations getting as she phrased it frocks and governesses for her little girl who had been left in France and having to devote the remaining hours to long shopping expeditions with her motherinlaw
Nevertheless during her brief escapes from duty Darrow had had time to feel her safe in the custody of his devotion set apart for some inevitable hour and the last evening at the theatre between the overshadowing Marquise and the unsuspicious Owen they had had an almost decisive exchange of words
Now in the rattle of the wind about his ears Darrow continued to hear the mocking echo of her message Unexpected obstacle
In such an existence as Mrs Leaths at once so ordered and so exposed he knew how small a complication might assume the magnitude of an obstacle yet even allowing as impartially as his state of mind permitted for the fact that with her motherinlaw always and her stepson intermittently under her roof her lot involved a hundred small accommodations generally foreign to the freedom of widowhoodeven so he could not but think that the very ingenuity bred of such conditions might have helped her to find a way out of them
No her reason whatever it was could in this case be nothing but a pretext unless he leaned to the less flattering alternative that any reason seemed good enough for postponing him
Certainly if her welcome had meant what he imagined she could not for the second time within a few weeks have submitted so tamely to the disarrangement of their plans a disarrangement whichhis official duties consideredmight for all she knew result in his not being able to go to her for months
Please dont come till thirtieth
The thirtiethand it was now the fifteenth
She flung back the fortnight on his hands as if he had been an idler indifferent to dates instead of an active young diplomatist who to respond to her call had had to hew his way through a very jungle of engagements
Please dont come till thirtieth
That was all
Not the shadow of an excuse or a regret not even the perfunctory have written with which it is usual to soften such blows
She didnt want him and had taken the shortest way to tell him so
Even in his first moment of exasperation it struck him as characteristic that she should not have padded her postponement with a fib
Certainly her moral angles were not draped
If I asked her to marry me shed have refused in the same language
But thank heaven I havent
he reflected
These considerations which had been with him every yard of the way from London reached a climax of irony as he was drawn into the crowd on the pier
It did not soften his feelings to remember that but for her lack of forethought he might at this harsh end of the stormy May day have been sitting before his club fire in London instead of shivering in the damp human herd on the pier
Admitting the sexs traditional right to change she might at least have advised him of hers by telegraphing directly to his rooms
But in spite of their exchange of letters she had apparently failed to note his address and a breathless emissary had rushed from the Embassy to pitch her telegram into his compartment as the train was moving from the station
Yes he had given her chance enough to learn where he lived and this minor proof of her indifference became as he jammed his way through the crowd the main point of his grievance against her and of his derision of himself
Half way down the pier the prod of an umbrella increased his exasperation by rousing him to the fact that it was raining
Instantly the narrow ledge became a battleground of thrusting slanting parrying domes
The wind rose with the rain and the harried wretches exposed to this double assault wreaked on their neighbours the vengeance they could not take on the elements
Darrow whose healthy enjoyment of life made him in general a good traveller tolerant of agglutinated humanity felt himself obscurely outraged by these promiscuous contacts
It was as though all the people about him had taken his measure and known his plight as though they were contemptuously bumping and shoving him like the inconsiderable thing he had become
She doesnt want you doesnt want you doesnt want you their umbrellas and their elbows seemed to say
He had rashly vowed when the telegram was flung into his window At any rate I wont turn backas though it might cause the sender a malicious joy to have him retrace his steps rather than keep on to Paris
Now he perceived the absurdity of the vow and thanked his stars that he need not plunge to no purpose into the fury of waves outside the harbour
With this thought in his mind he turned back to look for his porter but the contiguity of dripping umbrellas made signalling impossible and perceiving that he had lost sight of the man he scrambled up again to the platform
As he reached it a descending umbrella caught him in the collar bone and the next moment bent sideways by the wind it turned inside out and soared up kitewise at the end of a helpless female arm
Darrow caught the umbrella lowered its inverted ribs and looked up at the face it exposed to him
Wait a minute he said you cant stay here
As he spoke a surge of the crowd drove the owner of the umbrella abruptly down on him
Darrow steadied her with extended arms and regaining her footing she cried out Oh dear oh dear
Its in ribbons
Her lifted face fresh and flushed in the driving rain woke in him a memory of having seen it at a distant time and in a vaguely unsympathetic setting but it was no moment to follow up such clues and the face was obviously one to make its way on its own merits
Its possessor had dropped her bag and bundles to clutch at the tattered umbrella
I bought it only yesterday at the Stores andyesits utterly done for
she lamented
Darrow smiled at the intensity of her distress
It was food for the moralist that side by side with such catastrophes as his human nature was still agitating itself over its microscopic woes
Heres mine if you want it
he shouted back at her through the shouting of the gale
The offer caused the young lady to look at him more intently
Why its Mr
Darrow
she exclaimed and then all radiant recognition Oh thank you
Well share it if you will
She knew him then and he knew her but how and where had they met
He put aside the problem for subsequent solution and drawing her into a more sheltered corner bade her wait till he could find his porter
When a few minutes later he came back with his recovered property and the news that the boat would not leave till the tide had turned she showed no concern
Not for two hours
How luckythen I can find my trunk
Ordinarily Darrow would have felt little disposed to involve himself in the adventure of a young female who had lost her trunk but at the moment he was glad of any pretext for activity
Even should he decide to take the next up train from Dover he still had a yawning hour to fill and the obvious remedy was to devote it to the loveliness in distress under his umbrella
Youve lost a trunk
Let me see if I can find it
It pleased him that she did not return the conventional Oh WOULD you
Instead she corrected him with a laughNot a trunk but my trunk Ive no other and then added briskly Youd better first see to getting your own things on the boat
This made him answer as if to give substance to his plans by discussing them I dont actually know that Im going over
Not going over
Wellperhaps not by this boat
Again he felt a stealing indecision
I may probably have to go back to London
ImIm waitingexpecting a letterShell think me a defaulter he reflected
But meanwhile theres plenty of time to find your trunk
He picked up his companions bundles and offered her an arm which enabled her to press her slight person more closely under his umbrella and as thus linked they beat their way back to the platform pulled together and apart like marionettes on the wires of the wind he continued to wonder where he could have seen her
He had immediately classed her as a compatriot her small nose her clear tints a kind of sketchy delicacy in her face as though she had been brightly but lightly washed in with watercolour all confirmed the evidence of her high sweet voice and of her quick incessant gesturesShe was clearly an American but with the loose native quality strained through a closer woof of manners the composite product of an enquiring and adaptable race
All this however did not help him to fit a name to her for just such instances were perpetually pouring through the London Embassy and the etched and angular American was becoming rarer than the fluid type
More puzzling than the fact of his being unable to identify her was the persistent sense connecting her with something uncomfortable and distasteful
So pleasant a vision as that gleaming up at him between wet brown hair and wet brown boa should have evoked only associations as pleasing but each effort to fit her image into his past resulted in the same memories of boredom and a vague discomfort II Dont you remember me nowat Mrs
Murretts
She threw the question at Darrow across a table of the quiet coffeeroom to which after a vainly prolonged quest for her trunk he had suggested taking her for a cup of tea
In this musty retreat she had removed her dripping hat hung it on the fender to dry and stretched herself on tiptoe in front of the round eaglecrowned mirror above the mantel vases of dyed immortelles while she ran her fingers comb wise through her hair
The gesture had acted on Darrows numb feelings as the glow of the fire acted on his circulation and when he had asked Arent your feet wet too
and after frank inspection of a stoutshod sole she had answered cheerfully Noluckily I had on my new boots he began to feel that human intercourse would still be tolerable if it were always as free from formality
The removal of his companions hat besides provoking this reflection gave him his first full sight of her face and this was so favourable that the name she now pronounced fell on him with a quite disproportionate shock of dismay
Oh Mrs Murrettswas it THERE
He remembered her now of course remembered her as one of the shadowy sidling presences in the background of that awful house in Chelsea one of the dumb appendages of the shrieking unescapable Mrs Murrett into whose talons he had fallen in the course of his headlong pursuit of Lady Ulrica Crispin
Oh the taste of stale follies
How insipid it was yet how it clung
I used to pass you on the stairs she reminded him
Yes he had seen her slip byhe recalled it nowas he dashed up to the drawingroom in quest of Lady Ulrica
The thought made him steal a longer look
How could such a face have been merged in the Murrett mob
Its fugitive slanting lines that lent themselves to all manner of tender tilts and foreshortenings had the freakish grace of some young head of the Italian comedy
The hair stood up from her forehead in a boyish elflock and its colour matched her auburn eyes flecked with black and the little brown spot on her cheek between the ear that was meant to have a rose behind it and the chin that should have rested on a ruff
When she smiled the left corner of her mouth went up a little higher than the right and her smile began in her eyes and ran down to her lips in two lines of light
He had dashed past that to reach Lady Ulrica Crispin
But of course you wouldnt remember me she was saying
My name is VinerSophy Viner
Not remember her
But of course he DID
He was genuinely sure of it now
Youre Mrs Murretts niece he declared
She shook her head
No not even that
Only her reader
Her reader
Do you mean to say she ever reads
Miss Viner enjoyed his wonder
Dear no
But I wrote notes and made up the visitingbook and walked the dogs and saw bores for her
Darrow groaned
That must have been rather bad
Yes but nothing like as bad as being her niece
That I can well believe
Im glad to hear he added that you put it all in the past tense
She seemed to droop a little at the allusion then she lifted her chin with a jerk of defiance
Yes
All is at an end between us
Weve just parted in tearsbut not in silence
Just parted
Do you mean to say youve been there all this time
Ever since you used to come there to see Lady Ulrica
Does it seem to you so awfully long ago
The unexpectedness of the thrustas well as its doubtful tastechilled his growing enjoyment of her chatter
He had really been getting to like herhad recovered under the candid approval of her eye his usual sense of being a personable young man with all the privileges pertaining to the state instead of the anonymous rag of humanity he had felt himself in the crowd on the pier
It annoyed him at that particular moment to be reminded that naturalness is not always consonant with taste
She seemed to guess his thought
You dont like my saying that you came for Lady Ulrica
she asked leaning over the table to pour herself a second cup of tea
He liked her quickness at any rate
Its better he laughed than your thinking I came for Mrs
Murrett
Oh we never thought anybody came for Mrs Murrett
It was always for something else the music or the cookwhen there was a good oneor the other people generally ONE of the other people
I see
She was amusing and that in his present mood was more to his purpose than the exact shade of her taste
It was odd too to discover suddenly that the blurred tapestry of Mrs Murretts background had all the while been alive and full of eyes
Now with a pair of them looking into his he was conscious of a queer reversal of perspective
Who were the we
Were you a cloud of witnesses
There were a good many of us
She smiled
Let me see who was there in your time
Mrs Boltand Mademoiselleand Professor Didymus and the Polish Countess
Dont you remember the Polish Countess
She crystalgazed and played accompaniments and Mrs Murrett chucked her because Mrs Didymus accused her of hypnotizing the Professor
But of course you dont remember
We were all invisible to you but we could see
And we all used to wonder about you Again Darrow felt a redness in the temples
What about me
Wellwhether it was you or she who He winced but hid his disapproval
It made the time pass to listen to her
And what if one may ask was your conclusion
Well Mrs Bolt and Mademoiselle and the Countess naturally thought it was SHE but Professor Didymus and Jimmy Branceespecially Jimmy Just a moment who on earth is Jimmy Brance
She exclaimed in wonder You WERE absorbednot to remember Jimmy Brance
He must have been right about you after all
She let her amused scrutiny dwell on him
But how could you
She was false from head to foot
False
In spite of time and satiety the male instinct of ownership rose up and repudiated the charge
Miss Viner caught his look and laughed
Oh I only meant externally
You see she often used to come to my room after tennis or to touch up in the evenings when they were going on and I assure you she took apart like a puzzle
In fact I used to say to Jimmyjust to make him wildIll bet you anything you like theres nothing wrong because I know shed never dare un She broke the word in two and her quick blush made her face like a shallowpetalled rose shading to the deeper pink of the centre
The situation was saved for Darrow by an abrupt rush of memories and he gave way to a mirth which she as frankly echoed
Of course she gasped through her laughter I only said it to tease Jimmy Her amusement obscurely annoyed him
Oh youre all alike
he exclaimed moved by an unaccountable sense of disappointment
She caught him up in a flashshe didnt miss things
You say that because you think Im spiteful and envious
YesI was envious of Lady UlricaOh not on account of you or Jimmy Brance
Simply because she had almost all the things Ive always wanted clothes and fun and motors and admiration and yachting and Pariswhy Paris alone would be enoughAnd how do you suppose a girl can see that sort of thing about her day after day and never wonder why some women who dont seem to have any more right to it have it all tumbled into their laps while others are writing dinner invitations and straightening out accounts and copying visiting lists and finishing golfstockings and matching ribbons and seeing that the dogs get their sulphur
One looks in ones glass after all
She launched the closing words at him on a cry that lifted them above the petulance of vanity but his sense of her words was lost in the surprise of her face
Under the flying clouds of her excitement it was no longer a shallow flowercup but a darkening gleaming mirror that might give back strange depths of feeling
The girl had stuff in her he saw it and she seemed to catch the perception in his eyes
Thats the kind of education I got at Mrs Murrettsand I never had any other she said with a shrug
Good Lordwere you there so long
Five years
I stuck it out longer than any of the others
She spoke as though it were something to be proud of
Well thank God youre out of it now
Again a just perceptible shadow crossed her face
YesIm out of it now fast enough
And whatif I may askare you doing next
She brooded a moment behind drooped lids then with a touch of hauteur Im going to Paris to study for the stage
The stage
Darrow stared at her dismayed
All his confused contradictory impressions assumed a new aspect at this announcement and to hide his surprise he added lightly Ahthen you will have Paris after all
Hardly Lady Ulricas Paris
It s not likely to be roses roses all the way
Its not indeed
Real compassion prompted him to continue Have you anyany influence you can count on
She gave a somewhat flippant little laugh
None but my own
Ive never had any other to count on
He passed over the obvious reply
But have you any idea how the profession is overcrowded
I know Im trite Ive a very clear idea
But I couldnt go on as I was
Of course not
But since as you say youd stuck it out longer than any of the others couldnt you at least have held on till you were sure of some kind of an opening
She made no reply for a moment then she turned a listless glance to the rainbeaten window
Oughtnt we be starting
she asked with a lofty assumption of indifference that might have been Lady Ulricas
Darrow surprised by the change but accepting her rebuff as a phase of what he guessed to be a confused and tormented mood rose from his seat and lifted her jacket from the chairback on which she had hung it to dry
As he held it toward her she looked up at him quickly
The truth is we quarrelled she broke out and I left last night without my dinnerand without my salary
Ah he groaned with a sharp perception of all the sordid dangers that might attend such a break with Mrs Murrett
And without a character
she added as she slipped her arms into the jacket
And without a trunk as it appears but didnt you say that before going thered be time for another look at the station
There was time for another look at the station but the look again resulted in disappointment since her trunk was nowhere to be found in the huge heap disgorged by the newly arrived London express
The fact caused Miss Viner a moments perturbation but she promptly adjusted herself to the necessity of proceeding on her journey and her decision confirmed Darrows vague resolve to go to Paris instead of retracing his way to London
Miss Viner seemed cheered at the prospect of his company and sustained by his offer to telegraph to Charing Cross for the missing trunk and he left her to wait in the fly while he hastened back to the telegraph office
The enquiry despatched he was turning away from the desk when another thought struck him and he went back and indited a message to his servant in London If any letters with French postmark received since departure forward immediately to Terminus Hotel Gare du Nord Paris
Then he rejoined Miss Viner and they drove off through the rain to the pier
III Almost as soon as the train left Calais her head had dropped back into the corner and she had fallen asleep
Sitting opposite in the compartment from which he had contrived to have other travellers excluded Darrow looked at her curiously
He had never seen a face that changed so quickly
A moment since it had danced like a field of daisies in a summer breeze now under the pallid oscillating light of the lamp overhead it wore the hard stamp of experience as of a soft thing chilled into shape before its curves had rounded and it moved him to see that care already stole upon her when she slept
The story she had imparted to him in the wheezing shaking cabin and at the Calais buffetwhere he had insisted on offering her the dinner she had missed at Mrs Murretts had given a distincter outline to her figure
From the moment of entering the New York boardingschool to which a preoccupied guardian had hastily consigned her after the death of her parents she had found herself alone in a busy and indifferent world
Her youthful history might in fact have been summed up in the statement that everybody had been too busy to look after her
Her guardian a drudge in a big banking house was absorbed by the office the guardians wife by her health and her religion and an elder sister Laura married unmarried remarried and pursuing through all these alternating phases some vaguely artistic ideal on which the guardian and his wife looked askance had as Darrow conjectured taken their disapproval as a pretext for not troubling herself about poor Sophy to whomperhaps for this reasonshe had remained the incarnation of remote romantic possibilities
In the course of time a sudden stroke of the guardians had thrown his personal affairs into a state of confusion from whichafter his widely lamented deathit became evident that it would not be possible to extricate his wards inheritance
No one deplored this more sincerely than his widow who saw in it one more proof of her husbands life having been sacrificed to the innumerable duties imposed on him and who could hardlybut for the counsels of religionhave brought herself to pardon the young girl for her indirect share in hastening his end
Sophy did not resent this point of view
She was really much sorrier for her guardians death than for the loss of her insignificant fortune
The latter had represented only the means of holding her in bondage and its disappearance was the occasion of her immediate plunge into the wide bright sea of life surrounding the islandof her captivity
She had first landedthanks to the intervention of the ladies who had directed her educationin a Fifth Avenue schoolroom where for a few months she acted as a buffer between three autocratic infants and their bodyguard of nurses and teachers
The toopressing attentions of their fathers valet had caused her to fly this sheltered spot against the express advice of her educational superiors who implied that in their own case refinement and selfrespect had always sufficed to keep the most ungovernable passions at bay
The experience of the guardians widow having been precisely similar and the deplorable precedent of Lauras career being present to all their minds none of these ladies felt any obligation to intervene farther in Sophys affairs and she was accordingly left to her own resources
A schoolmate from the Rocky Mountains who was taking her father and mother to Europe had suggested Sophys accompanying them and going round with her while her progenitors in the care of the courier nursed their ailments at a fashionable bath
Darrow gathered that the going round with Mamie Hoke was a varied and diverting process but this relatively brilliant phase of Sophys career was cut short by the elopement of the inconsiderate Mamie with a matinee idol who had followed her from New York and by the precipitate return of her parents to negotiate for the repurchase of their child
It was thenafter an interval of repose with compassionate but impecunious American friends in Paristhat Miss Viner had been drawn into the turbid current of Mrs Murretts career
The impecunious compatriots had found Mrs Murrett for her and it was partly on their account because they were such dears and so unconscious poor confiding things of what they were letting her in for that Sophy had stuck it out so long in the dreadful house in Chelsea
The Farlows she explained to Darrow were the best friends she had ever had and the only ones who had ever been decent about Laura whom they had seen once and intensely admired but even after twenty years of Paris they were the most incorrigibly inexperienced angels and quite persuaded that Mrs Murrett was a woman of great intellectual eminence and the house at Chelsea the last of the salons Darrow knew what she meant
And she hadnt liked to undeceive them knowing that to do so would be virtually to throw herself back on their hands and feeling moreover after her previous experiences the urgent need of gaining at any cost a name for stability besides whichshe threw it off with a slight laughno other chance in all these years had happened to come to her
She had brushed in this outline of her career with light rapid strokes and in a tone of fatalism oddly untinged by bitterness
Darrow perceived that she classified people according to their greater or less luck in life but she appeared to harbour no resentment against the undefined power which dispensed the gift in such unequal measure
Things came ones way or they didnt and meanwhile one could only look on and make the most of small compensations such as watching the show at Mrs Murretts and talking over the Lady Ulricas and other footlight figures
And at any moment of course a turn of the kaleidoscope might suddenly toss a bright spangle into the grey pattern of ones days
This lighthearted philosophy was not without charm to a young man accustomed to more traditional views
George Darrow had had a fairly varied experience of feminine types but the women he had frequented had either been pronouncedly ladies or they had not
Grateful to both for ministering to the more complex masculine nature and disposed to assume that they had been evolved if not designed to that end he had instinctively kept the two groups apart in his mind avoiding that intermediate society which attempts to conciliate both theories of life
Bohemianism seemed to him a cheaper convention than the other two and he liked above all people who went as far as they could in their own lineliked his ladies and their rivals to be equally unashamed of showing for exactly what they were
He had not indeedthe fact of Lady Ulrica was there to remind him been without his experience of a third type but that experience had left him with a contemptuous distaste for the woman who uses the privileges of one class to shelter the customs of another
As to young girls he had never thought much about them since his early love for the girl who had become Mrs Leath
That episode seemed as he looked back on it to bear no more relation to reality than a pale decorative design to the confused richness of a summer landscape
He no longer understood the violent impulses and dreamy pauses of his own young heart or the inscrutable abandonments and reluctances of hers
He had known a moment of anguish at losing herthe mad plunge of youthful instincts against the barrier of fate but the first wave of stronger sensation had swept away all but the outline of their story and the memory of Anna Summers had made the image of the young girl sacred but the class uninteresting
Such generalisations belonged however to an earlier stage of his experience
The more he saw of life the more incalculable he found it and he had learned to yield to his impressions without feeling the youthful need of relating them to others
It was the girl in the opposite seat who had roused in him the dormant habit of comparison
She was distinguished from the daughters of wealth by her avowed acquaintance with the real business of living a familiarity as different as possible from their theoretical proficiency yet it seemed to Darrow that her experience had made her free without hardness and selfassured without assertiveness
The rush into Amiens and the flash of the station lights into their compartment broke Miss Viners sleep and without changing her position she lifted her lids and looked at Darrow
There was neither surprise nor bewilderment in the look
She seemed instantly conscious not so much of where she was as of the fact that she was with him and that fact seemed enough to reassure her
She did not even turn her head to look out her eyes continued to rest on him with a vague smile which appeared to light her face from within while her lips kept their sleepy droop
Shouts and the hurried tread of travellers came to them through the confusing crosslights of the platform
A head appeared at the window and Darrow threw himself forward to defend their solitude but the intruder was only a train hand going his round of inspection
He passed on and the lights and cries of the station dropped away merged in a wider haze and a hollower resonance as the train gathered itself up with a long shake and rolled out again into the darkness
Miss Viners head sank back against the cushion pushing out a dusky wave of hair above her forehead
The swaying of the train loosened a lock over her ear and she shook it back with a movement like a boys while her gaze still rested on her companion
Youre not too tired
She shook her head with a smile
We shall be in before midnight
Were very nearly on time
He verified the statement by holding up his watch to the lamp
She nodded dreamily
Its all right
I telegraphed Mrs Farlow that they mustnt think of coming to the station but theyll have told the concierge to look out for me
Youll let me drive you there
She nodded again and her eyes closed
It was very pleasant to Darrow that she made no effort to talk or to dissemble her sleepiness
He sat watching her till the upper lashes met and mingled with the lower and their blent shadow lay on her cheek then he stood up and drew the curtain over the lamp drowning the compartment in a bluish twilight
As he sank back into his seat he thought how differently Anna Summersor even Anna Leathwould have behaved
She would not have talked too much she would not have been either restless or embarrassed but her adaptability her appropriateness would not have been nature but tact
The oddness of the situation would have made sleep impossible or if weariness had overcome her for a moment she would have waked with a start wondering where she was and how she had come there and if her hair were tidy and nothing short of hairpins and a glass would have restored her self possession
The reflection set him wondering whether the sheltered girls bringingup might not unfit her for all subsequent contact with life
How much nearer to it had Mrs Leath been brought by marriage and motherhood and the passage of fourteen years
What were all her reticences and evasions but the result of the deadening process of forming a lady
The freshness he had marvelled at was like the unnatural whiteness of flowers forced in the dark
As he looked back at their few days together he saw that their intercourse had been marked on her part by the same hesitations and reserves which had chilled their earlier intimacy
Once more they had had their hour together and she had wasted it
As in her girlhood her eyes had made promises which her lips were afraid to keep
She was still afraid of life of its ruthlessness its danger and mystery
She was still the petted little girl who cannot be left alone in the darkHis memory flew back to their youthful story and longforgotten details took shape before him
How frail and faint the picture was
They seemed he and she like the ghostly lovers of the Grecian Urn forever pursuing without ever clasping each other
To this day he did not quite know what had parted them the break had been as fortuitous as the fluttering apart of two seedvessels on a wave of summer air
The very slightness vagueness of the memory gave it an added poignancy
He felt the mystic pang of the parent for a child which has just breathed and died
Why had it happened thus when the least shifting of influences might have made it all so different
If she had been given to him then he would have put warmth in her veins and light in her eyes would have made her a woman through and through
Musing thus he had the sense of waste that is the bitterest harvest of experience
A love like his might have given her the divine gift of selfrenewal and now he saw her fated to wane into old age repeating the same gestures echoing the words she had always heard and perhaps never guessing that just outside her glazed and curtained consciousness life rolled away a vast blackness starred with lights like the night landscape beyond the windows of the train
The engine lowered its speed for the passage through a sleeping station
In the light of the platform lamp Darrow looked across at his companion
Her head had dropped toward one shoulder and her lips were just far enough apart for the reflection of the upper one to deepen the colour of the other
The jolting of the train had again shaken loose the lock above her ear
It danced on her cheek like the flit of a brown wing over flowers and Darrow felt an intense desire to lean forward and put it back behind her ear
IV As their motorcab on the way from the Gare du Nord turned into the central glitter of the Boulevard Darrow had bent over to point out an incandescent threshold
There
Above the doorway an arch of flame flashed out the name of a great actress whose closing performances in a play of unusual originality had been the theme of long articles in the Paris papers which Darrow had tossed into their compartment at Calais
Thats what you must see before youre twentyfour hours older
The girl followed his gesture eagerly
She was all awake and alive now as if the heady rumours of the streets with their long effervescences of light had passed into her veins like wine
Cerdine
Is that where she acts
She put her head out of the window straining back for a glimpse of the sacred threshold
As they flew past it she sank into her seat with a satisfied sigh
Its delicious enough just to KNOW shes there
Ive never seen her you know
When I was here with Mamie Hoke we never went anywhere but to the music halls because she couldnt understand any French and when I came back afterward to the Farlows I was dead broke and couldnt afford the play and neither could they so the only chance we had was when friends of theirs invited usand once it was to see a tragedy by a Roumanian lady and the other time it was for LAmi Fritz at the Francais
Darrow laughed
You must do better than that now
Le Vertige is a fine thing and Cerdine gets some wonderful effects out of it
You must come with me tomorrow evening to see itwith your friends of courseThat is he added if theres any sort of chance of getting seats
The flash of a street lamp lit up her radiant face
Oh will you really take us
What fun to think that its tomorrow already
It was wonderfully pleasant to be able to give such pleasure
Darrow was not rich but it was almost impossible for him to picture the state of persons with tastes and perceptions like his own to whom an evening at the theatre was an unattainable indulgence
There floated through his mind an answer of Mrs Leaths to his enquiry whether she had seen the play in question
No
I meant to of course but one is so overwhelmed with things in Paris
And then Im rather sick of Cerdineone is always being dragged to see her
That among the people he frequented was the usual attitude toward such opportunities
There were too many they were a nuisance one had to defend ones self
He even remembered wondering at the moment whether to a really fine taste the exceptional thing could ever become indifferent through habit whether the appetite for beauty was so soon dulled that it could be kept alive only by privation
Here at any rate was a fine chance to experiment with such a hunger he almost wished he might stay on in Paris long enough to take the measure of Miss Viners receptivity
She was still dwelling on his promise Its too beautiful of you
Oh dont you THINK youll be able to get seats
And then after a pause of brimming appreciation I wonder if youll think me horridbut it may be my only chance and if you cant get places for us all wouldnt you perhaps just take ME
After all the Farlows may have seen it
He had not of course thought her horrid but only the more engaging for being so natural and so unashamed of showing the frank greed of her famished youth
Oh you shall go somehow
he had gaily promised her and she had dropped back with a sigh of pleasure as their cab passed into the dimlylit streets of the Farlows quarter beyond the Seine
This little passage came back to him the next morning as he opened his hotel window on the early roar of the Northern Terminus
The girl was there in the room next to him
That had been the first point in his waking consciousness
The second was a sense of relief at the obligation imposed on him by this unexpected turn of everts
To wake to the necessity of action to postpone perforce the fruitless contemplation of his private grievance was cause enough for gratitude even if the small adventure in which he found himself involved had not on its own merits roused an instinctive curiosity to see it through
When he and his companion the night before had reached the Farlows door in the rue de la Chaise it was only to find after repeated assaults on its panels that the Farlows were no longer there
They had moved away the week before not only from their apartment but from Paris and Miss Viners breach with Mrs Murrett had been too sudden to permit her letter and telegram to overtake them
Both communications no doubt still reposed in a pigeonhole of the loge but its custodian when drawn from his lair sulkily declined to let Miss Viner verify the fact and only flung out in return for Darrows bribe the statement that the Americans had gone to Joigny
To pursue them there at that hour was manifestly impossible and Miss Viner disturbed but not disconcerted by this new obstacle had quite simply acceded to Darrows suggestion that she should return for what remained of the night to the hotel where he had sent his luggage
The drive back through the dark hush before dawn with the nocturnal blaze of the Boulevard fading around them like the false lights of a magicians palace had so played on her impressionability that she seemed to give no farther thought to her own predicament
Darrow noticed that she did not feel the beauty and mystery of the spectacle as much as its pressure of human significance all its hidden implications of emotion and adventure
As they passed the shadowy colonnade of the Francais remote and templelike in the paling lights he felt a clutch on his arm and heard the cry There are things THERE that I want so desperately to see
and all the way back to the hotel she continued to question him with shrewd precision and an artless thirst for detail about the theatrical life of Paris
He was struck afresh as he listened by the way in which her naturalness eased the situation of constraint leaving to it only a pleasant savour of good fellowship
It was the kind of episode that one might in advance have characterized as awkward yet that was proving in the event as much outside such definitions as a sunrise stroll with a dryad in a dewdrenched forest and Darrow reflected that mankind would never have needed to invent tact if it had not first invented social complications
It had been understood with his goodnight to Miss Viner that the next morning he was to look up the Joigny trains and see her safely to the station but while he breakfasted and waited for a timetable he recalled again her cry of joy at the prospect of seeing Cerdine
It was certainly a pity since that most elusive and incalculable of artists was leaving the next week for South America to miss what might be a last sight of her in her greatest part and Darrow having dressed and made the requisite excerpts from the timetable decided to carry the result of his deliberations to his neighbours door
It instantly opened at his knock and she came forth looking as if she had been plunged into some sparkling element which had curled up all her drooping tendrils and wrapped her in a shimmer of fresh leaves
Well what do you think of me
she cried and with a hand at her waist she spun about as if to show off some miracle of Parisian dressmaking
I think the missing trunk has comeand that it was worth waiting for
You DO like my dress
I adore it
I always adore new dresseswhy you dont mean to say its NOT a new one
She laughed out her triumph
No no no
My trunk hasnt come and this is only my old rag of yesterdaybut I never knew the trick to fail
And as he stared You see she joyously explained Ive always had to dress in all kinds of dreary leftovers and sometimes when everybody else was smart and new it used to make me awfully miserable
So one day when Mrs Murrett dragged me down unexpectedly to fill a place at dinner I suddenly thought Id try spinning around like that and say to every one WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME
And do you know they were all taken in including Mrs Murrett who didnt recognize my old turned and dyed rags and told me afterward it was awfully bad form to dress as if I were somebody that people would expect to know
And ever since whenever Ive particularly wanted to look nice Ive just asked people what they thought of my new frock and theyre always always taken in
She dramatized her explanation so vividly that Darrow felt as if his point were gained
Ah but this confirms your vocationof course he cried you must see Cerdine
and seeing her face fall at this reminder of the change in her prospects he hastened to set forth his plan
As he did so he saw how easy it was to explain things to her
She would either accept his suggestion or she would not but at least she would waste no time in protestations and objections or any vain sacrifice to the idols of conformity
The conviction that one could on any given point almost predicate this of her gave him the sense of having advanced far enough in her intimacy to urge his arguments against a hasty pursuit of her friends
Yes it would certainly be foolishshe at once agreedin the case of such dear indefinite angels as the Farlows to dash off after them without more positive proof that they were established at Joigny and so established that they could take her in
She owned it was but too probable that they had gone there to cut down and might be doing so in quarters too contracted to receive her and it would be unfair on that chance to impose herself on them unannounced
The simplest way of getting farther light on the question would be to go back to the rue de la Chaise where at that more conversable hour the concierge might be less chary of detail and she could decide on her next step in the light of such facts as he imparted
Point by point she fell in with the suggestion recognizing in the light of their unexplained flight that the Farlows might indeed be in a situation on which one could not too rashly intrude
Her concern for her friends seemed to have effaced all thought of herself and this little indication of character gave Darrow a quite disproportionate pleasure
She agreed that it would be well to go at once to the rue de la Chaise but met his proposal that they should drive by the declaration that it was a waste not to walk in Paris so they set off on foot through the cheerful tumult of the streets
The walk was long enough for him to learn many things about her
The storm of the previous night had cleared the air and Paris shone in morning beauty under a sky that was all broad wet washes of white and blue but Darrow again noticed that her visual sensitiveness was less keen than her feeling for what he was sure the good Farlowswhom he already seemed to knowwould have called the human interest
She seemed hardly conscious of sensations of form and colour or of any imaginative suggestion and the spectacle before themalways in its scenic splendour so moving to her companionbroke up under her scrutiny into a thousand minor points the things in the shops the types of character and manner of occupation shown in the passing faces the street signs the names of the hotels they passed the motley brightness of the flowercarts the identity of the churches and public buildings that caught her eye
But what she liked best he divined was the mere fact of being free to walk abroad in the bright air her tongue rattling on as it pleased while her feet kept time to the mighty orchestration of the citys sounds
Her delight in the fresh air in the freedom light and sparkle of the morning gave him a sudden insight into her stifled past nor was it indifferent to him to perceive how much his presence evidently added to her enjoyment
If only as a sympathetic ear he guessed what he must be worth to her
The girl had been dying for some one to talk to some one before whom she could unfold and shake out to the light her poor little shutaway emotions
Years of repression were revealed in her sudden burst of confidence and the pity she inspired made Darrow long to fill her few free hours to the brim
She had the gift of rapid definition and his questions as to the life she had led with the Farlows during the interregnum between the Hoke and Murrett eras called up before him a queer little corner of Parisian existence
The Farlows themselveshe a painter she a magazine writer rose before him in all their incorruptible simplicity an elderly New England couple with vague yearnings for enfranchisement who lived in Paris as if it were a Massachusetts suburb and dwelt hopefully on the higher side of the Gallic nature
With equal vividness she set before him the component figures of the circle from which Mrs Farlow drew the Inner Glimpses of French Life appearing over her name in a leading New England journal the Roumanian lady who had sent them tickets for her tragedy an elderly French gentleman who on the strength of a weeks stay at Folkestone translated English fiction for the provincial press a lady from Wichita Kansas who advocated free love and the abolition of the corset a clergymans widow from Torquay who had written an English Ladies Guide to Foreign Galleries and a Russian sculptor who lived on nuts and was almost certainly an anarchist
It was this nucleus and its outer ring of musical architectural and other American students which posed successively to Mrs Farlows versatile fancy as a centre of University Life a Salon of the Faubourg St Germain a group of Parisian Intellectuals or a Crosssection of Montmartre but even her faculty for extracting from it the most varied literary effects had not sufficed to create a permanent demand for the Inner Glimpses and there were days whenMr Farlows landscapes being equally unmarketablea temporary withdrawal to the country subsequently utilized as Peeps into Chateau Life became necessary to the courageous couple
Five years of Mrs Murretts world while increasing Sophys tenderness for the Farlows had left her with few illusions as to their power of advancing her fortunes and she did not conceal from Darrow that her theatrical projects were of the vaguest
They hung mainly on the problematical goodwill of an ancient comedienne with whom Mrs Farlow had a slight acquaintance extensively utilized in Stars of the French Footlights and Behind the Scenes at the Francais and who had once with signs of approval heard Miss Viner recite the Nuit de Mai
But of course I know how much thats worth the girl broke off with one of her flashes of shrewdness
And besides it isnt likely that a poor old fossil like Mme
Dolle could get anybody to listen to her now even if she really thought I had talent
But she might introduce me to people or at least give me a few tips
If I could manage to earn enough to pay for lessons Id go straight to some of the big people and work with them
Im rather hoping the Farlows may find me a chance of that kindan engagement with some American family in Paris who would want to be gone round with like the Hokes and whod leave me time enough to study
In the rue de la Chaise they learned little except the exact address of the Farlows and the fact that they had sublet their flat before leaving
This information obtained Darrow proposed to Miss Viner that they should stroll along the quays to a little restaurant looking out on the Seine and there over the plat du jour consider the next step to be taken
The long walk had given her cheeks a glow indicative of wholesome hunger and she made no difficulty about satisfying it in Darrows company
Regaining the river they walked on in the direction of Notre Dame delayed now and again by the young mans irresistible tendency to linger over the bookstalls and by his everfresh response to the shifting beauties of the scene
For two years his eyes had been subdued to the atmospheric effects of London to the mysterious fusion of darklypiled city and lowlying bituminous sky and the transparency of the French air which left the green gardens and silvery stones so classically clear yet so softly harmonized struck him as having a kind of conscious intelligence
Every line of the architecture every arch of the bridges the very sweep of the strong bright river between them while contributing to this effect sent forth each a separate appeal to some sensitive memory so that for Darrow a walk through the Paris streets was always like the unrolling of a vast tapestry from which countless stored fragrances were shaken out
It was a proof of the richness and multiplicity of the spectacle that it served without incongruity for so different a purpose as the background of Miss Viners enjoyment
As a mere dropscene for her personal adventure it was just as much in its place as in the evocation of great perspectives of feeling
For her as he again perceived when they were seated at their table in a low window above the Seine Paris was Paris by virtue of all its entertaining details its endless ingenuities of pleasantness
Where else for instance could one find the dear little dishes of hors doeuvre the symmetrically laid anchovies and radishes the thin golden shells of butter or the wood strawberries and brown jars of cream that gave to their repast the last refinement of rusticity
Hadnt he noticed she asked that cooking always expressed the national character and that French food was clever and amusing just because the people were
And in private houses everywhere how the dishes always resembled the talkhow the very same platitudes seemed to go into peoples mouths and come out of them
Couldnt he see just what kind of menu it would make if a fairy waved a wand and suddenly turned the conversation at a London dinner into joints and puddings
She always thought it a good sign when people liked Irish stew it meant that they enjoyed changes and surprises and taking life as it came and such a beautiful Parisian version of the dish as the navarin that was just being set before them was like the very best kind of talkthe kind when one could never tell beforehand just what was going to be said
Darrow as he watched her enjoyment of their innocent feast wondered if her vividness and vivacity were signs of her calling
She was the kind of girl in whom certain people would instantly have recognized the histrionic gift
But experience had led him to think that except at the creative moment the divine flame burns low in its possessors
The one or two really intelligent actresses he had known had struck him in conversation as either bovine or primitively jolly
He had a notion that save in the mind of genius the creative process absorbs too much of the whole stuff of being to leave much surplus for personal expression and the girl before him with her changing face and flexible fancies seemed destined to work in life itself rather than in any of its counterfeits
The coffee and liqueurs were already on the table when her mind suddenly sprang back to the Farlows
She jumped up with one of her subversive movements and declared that she must telegraph at once
Darrow called for writing materials and room was made at her elbow for the parched inkbottle and saturated blotter of the Parisian restaurant but the mere sight of these jaded implements seemed to paralyze Miss Viners faculties
She hung over the telegraphform with anxiouslydrawn brow the tip of the penhandle pressed against her lip and at length she raised her troubled eyes to Darrows
I simply cant think how to say it
Whatthat youre staying over to see Cerdine
But AM Iam I really
The joy of it flamed over her face
Darrow looked at his watch
You could hardly get an answer to your telegram in time to take a train to Joigny this afternoon even if you found your friends could have you
She mused for a moment tapping her lip with the pen
But I must let them know Im here
I must find out as soon as possible if they CAN have me
She laid the pen down despairingly
I never COULD write a telegram
she sighed
Try a letter then and tell them youll arrive tomorrow
This suggestion produced immediate relief and she gave an energetic dab at the inkbottle but after another interval of uncertain scratching she paused again
Oh its fearful
I dont know what on earth to say
I wouldnt for the world have them know how beastly Mrs Murretts been
Darrow did not think it necessary to answer
It was no business of his after all
He lit a cigar and leaned back in his seat letting his eyes take their fill of indolent pleasure
In the throes of invention she had pushed back her hat loosening the stray lock which had invited his touch the night before
After looking at it for a while he stood up and wandered to the window
Behind him he heard her pen scrape on
I dont want to worry themIm so certain theyve got bothers of their own
The faltering scratches ceased again
I wish I werent such an idiot about writing all the words get frightened and scurry away when I try to catch them
He glanced back at her with a smile as she bent above her task like a schoolgirl struggling with a composition
Her flushed cheek and frowning brow showed that her difficulty was genuine and not an artless device to draw him to her side
She was really powerless to put her thoughts in writing and the inability seemed characteristic of her quick impressionable mind and of the incessant comeandgo of her sensations
He thought of Anna Leaths letters or rather of the few he had received years ago from the girl who had been Anna Summers
He saw the slender firm strokes of the pen recalled the clear structure of the phrases and by an abrupt association of ideas remembered that at that very hour just such a document might be awaiting him at the hotel
What if it were there indeed and had brought him a complete explanation of her telegram
The revulsion of feeling produced by this thought made him look at the girl with sudden impatience
She struck him as positively stupid and he wondered how he could have wasted half his day with her when all the while Mrs Leaths letter might be lying on his table
At that moment if he could have chosen he would have left his companion on the spot but he had her on his hands and must accept the consequences
Some odd intuition seemed to make her conscious of his change of mood for she sprang from her seat crumpling the letter in her hand
Im too stupid but I wont keep you any longer
Ill go back to the hotel and write there
Her colour deepened and for the first time as their eyes met he noticed a faint embarrassment in hers
Could it be that his nearness was after all the cause of her confusion
The thought turned his vague impatience with her into a definite resentment toward himself
There was really no excuse for his having blundered into such an adventure
Why had he not shipped the girl off to Joigny by the evening train instead of urging her to delay and using Cerdine as a pretext
Paris was full of people he knew and his annoyance was increased by the thought that some friend of Mrs Leaths might see him at the play and report his presence there with a suspiciously goodlooking companion
The idea was distinctly disagreeable he did not want the woman he adored to think he could forget her for a moment
And by this time he had fully persuaded himself that a letter from her was awaiting him and had even gone so far as to imagine that its contents might annul the writers telegraphed injunction and call him to her side at once V At the porters desk a brief Pas de lettres fell destructively on the fabric of these hopes
Mrs Leath had not writtenshe had not taken the trouble to explain her telegram
Darrow turned away with a sharp pang of humiliation
Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and fears
He had put his question to the porter once before on returning to the hotel after luncheon and now coming back again in the late afternoon he was met by the same denial
The second post was in and had brought him nothing
A glance at his watch showed that he had barely time to dress before taking Miss Viner out to dine but as he turned to the lift a new thought struck him and hurrying back into the hall he dashed off another telegram to his servant Have you forwarded any letter with French postmark today
Telegraph answer Terminus
Some kind of reply would be certain to reach him on his return from the theatre and he would then know definitely whether Mrs Leath meant to write or not
He hastened up to his room and dressed with a lighter heart
Miss Viners vagrant trunk had finally found its way to its owner and clad in such modest splendour as it furnished she shone at Darrow across their restaurant table
In the reaction of his wounded vanity he found her prettier and more interesting than before
Her dress sloping away from the throat showed the graceful set of her head on its slender neck and the wide brim of her hat arched above her hair like a dusky halo
Pleasure danced in her eyes and on her lips and as she shone on him between the candleshades Darrow felt that he should not be at all sorry to be seen with her in public
He even sent a careless glance about him in the vague hope that it might fall on an acquaintance
At the theatre her vivacity sank into a breathless hush and she sat intent in her corner of their baignoire with the gaze of a neophyte about to be initiated into the sacred mysteries
Darrow placed himself behind her that he might catch her profile between himself and the stage
He was touched by the youthful seriousness of her expression
In spite of the experiences she must have had and of the twentyfour years to which she owned she struck him as intrinsically young and he wondered how so evanescent a quality could have been preserved in the desiccating Murrett air
As the play progressed he noticed that her immobility was traversed by swift flashes of perception
She was not missing anything and her intensity of attention when Cerdine was on the stage drew an anxious line between her brows
After the first act she remained for a few minutes rapt and motionless then she turned to her companion with a quick patter of questions
He gathered from them that she had been less interested in following the general drift of the play than in observing the details of its interpretation
Every gesture and inflection of the great actresss had been marked and analyzed and Darrow felt a secret gratification in being appealed to as an authority on the histrionic art
His interest in it had hitherto been merely that of the cultivated young man curious of all forms of artistic expression but in reply to her questions he found things to say about it which evidently struck his listener as impressive and original and with which he himself was not on the whole dissatisfied
Miss Viner was much more concerned to hear his views than to express her own and the deference with which she received his comments called from him more ideas about the theatre than he had ever supposed himself to possess
With the second act she began to give more attention to the development of the play though her interest was excited rather by what she called the story than by the conflict of character producing it
Oddly combined with her sharp apprehension of things theatrical her knowledge of technical dodges and greenroom precedents her glibness about lines and curtains was the primitive simplicity of her attitude toward the tale itself as toward something that was really happening and at which one assisted as at a streetaccident or a quarrel overheard in the next room
She wanted to know if Darrow thought the lovers really would be involved in the catastrophe that threatened them and when he reminded her that his predictions were disqualified by his having already seen the play she exclaimed Oh then please dont tell me whats going to happen
and the next moment was questioning him about Cerdines theatrical situation and her private history
On the latter point some of her enquiries were of a kind that it is not in the habit of young girls to make or even to know how to make but her apparent unconsciousness of the fact seemed rather to reflect on her past associates than on herself
When the second act was over Darrow suggested their taking a turn in the foyer and seated on one of its cramped red velvet sofas they watched the crowd surge up and down in a glare of lights and gilding
Then as she complained of the heat he led her through the press to the congested cafe at the foot of the stairs where orangeades were thrust at them between the shoulders of packed consommateurs and Darrow lighting a cigarette while she sucked her straw knew the primitive complacency of the man at whose companion other men stare
On a corner of their table lay a smeared copy of a theatrical journal
It caught Sophys eye and after poring over the page she looked up with an excited exclamation
Theyre giving Oedipe tomorrow afternoon at the Francais
I suppose youve seen it heaps and heaps of times
He smiled back at her
You must see it too
Well go tomorrow
She sighed at his suggestion but without discarding it
How can I
The last train for Joigny leaves at four
But you dont know yet that your friends will want you
I shall know tomorrow early
I asked Mrs Farlow to telegraph as soon as she got my letter
A twinge of compunction shot through Darrow
Her words recalled to him that on their return to the hotel after luncheon she had given him her letter to post and that he had never thought of it again
No doubt it was still in the pocket of the coat he had taken off when he dressed for dinner
In his perturbation he pushed back his chair and the movement made her look up at him
Whats the matter
Nothing
Onlyyou know I dont fancy that letter can have caught this afternoons post
Not caught it
Why not
Why Im afraid it will have been too late
He bent his head to light another cigarette
She struck her hands together with a gesture which to his amusement he noticed she had caught from Cerdine
Oh dear I hadnt thought of that
But surely it will reach them in the morning
Some time in the morning I suppose
You know the French provincial post is never in a hurry
I dont believe your letter would have been delivered this evening in any case
As this idea occurred to him he felt himself almost absolved
Perhaps then I ought to have telegraphed
Ill telegraph for you in the morning if you say so
The bell announcing the close of the entracte shrilled through the cafe and she sprang to her feet
Oh come come
We mustnt miss it
Instantly forgetful of the Farlows she slipped her arm through his and turned to push her way back to the theatre
As soon as the curtain went up she as promptly forgot her companion
Watching her from the corner to which he had returned Darrow saw that great waves of sensation were beating deliciously against her brain
It was as though every starved sensibility were throwing out feelers to the mounting tide as though everything she was seeing hearing imagining rushed in to fill the void of all she had always been denied
Darrow as he observed her again felt a detached enjoyment in her pleasure
She was an extraordinary conductor of sensation she seemed to transmit it physically in emanations that set the blood dancing in his veins
He had not often had the opportunity of studying the effects of a perfectly fresh impression on so responsive a temperament and he felt a fleeting desire to make its chords vibrate for his own amusement
At the end of the next act she discovered with dismay that in their transit to the cafe she had lost the beautiful pictured programme he had bought for her
She wanted to go back and hunt for it but Darrow assured her that he would have no trouble in getting her another
When he went out in quest of it she followed him protestingly to the door of the box and he saw that she was distressed at the thought of his having to spend an additional franc for her
This frugality smote Darrow by its contrast to her natural bright profusion and again he felt the desire to right so clumsy an injustice
When he returned to the box she was still standing in the doorway and he noticed that his were not the only eyes attracted to her
Then another impression sharply diverted his attention
Above the fagged faces of the Parisian crowd he had caught the fresh fair countenance of Owen Leath signalling a joyful recognition
The young man slim and eager had detached himself from two companions of his own type and was seeking to push through the press to his step mothers friend
The encounter to Darrow could hardly have been more inopportune it woke in him a confusion of feelings of which only the uppermost was allayed by seeing Sophy Viner as if instinctively warned melt back into the shadow of their box
A minute later Owen Leath was at his side
I was sure it was you
Such luck to run across you
Wont you come off with us to supper after its over
Montmartre or wherever else you please
Those two chaps over there are friends of mine at the Beaux Arts both of them rather good fellows and wed be so glad For half a second Darrow read in his hospitable eye the termination if youd bring the lady too then it deflected into Wed all be so glad if youd come
Darrow excusing himself with thanks lingered on for a few minutes chat in which every word and every tone of his companions voice was like a sharp light flashed into aching eyes
He was glad when the bell called the audience to their seats and young Leath left him with the friendly question Well see you at Givre later on
When he rejoined Miss Viner Darrows first care was to find out by a rapid inspection of the house whether Owen Leaths seat had given him a view of their box
But the young man was not visible from it and Darrow concluded that he had been recognized in the corridor and not at his companions side
He scarcely knew why it seemed to him so important that this point should be settled certainly his sense of reassurance was less due to regard for Miss Viner than to the persistent vision of grave offended eyes During the drive back to the hotel this vision was persistently kept before him by the thought that the evening post might have brought a letter from Mrs Leath
Even if no letter had yet come his servant might have telegraphed to say that one was on its way and at the thought his interest in the girl at his side again cooled to the fraternal the almost fatherly
She was no more to him after all than an appealing young creature to whom it was mildly agreeable to have offered an evenings diversion and when as they rolled into the illuminated court of the hotel she turned with a quick movement which brought her happy face close to his he leaned away affecting to be absorbed in opening the door of the cab
At the desk the night porter after a vain search through the pigeonholes was disposed to think that a letter or telegram had in fact been sent up for the gentleman and Darrow at the announcement could hardly wait to ascend to his room
Upstairs he and his companion had the long dimlylit corridor to themselves and Sophy paused on her threshold gathering up in one hand the pale folds of her cloak while she held the other out to Darrow
If the telegram comes early I shall be off by the first train so I suppose this is goodbye she said her eyes dimmed by a little shadow of regret
Darrow with a renewed start of contrition perceived that he had again forgotten her letter and as their hands met he vowed to himself that the moment she had left him he would dash down stairs to post it
Oh Ill see you in the morning of course
A tremor of pleasure crossed her face as he stood before her smiling a little uncertainly
At any rate she said I want to thank you now for my good day
He felt in her hand the same tremor he had seen in her face
But its YOU on the contrary he began lifting the hand to his lips
As he dropped it and their eyes met something passed through hers that was like a light carried rapidly behind a curtained window
Good night you must be awfully tired he said with a friendly abruptness turning away without even waiting to see her pass into her room
He unlocked his door and stumbling over the threshold groped in the darkness for the electric button
The light showed him a telegram on the table and he forgot everything else as he caught it up
No letter from France the message read
It fell from Darrows hand to the floor and he dropped into a chair by the table and sat gazing at the dingy drab and olive pattern of the carpet
She had not written then she had not written and it was manifest now that she did not mean to write
If she had had any intention of explaining her telegram she would certainly within twentyfour hours have followed it up by a letter
But she evidently did not intend to explain it and her silence could mean only that she had no explanation to give or else that she was too indifferent to be aware that one was needed
Darrow face to face with these alternatives felt a recrudescence of boyish misery
It was no longer his hurt vanity that cried out
He told himself that he could have borne an equal amount of pain if only it had left Mrs Leaths image untouched but he could not bear to think of her as trivial or insincere
The thought was so intolerable that he felt a blind desire to punish some one else for the pain it caused him
As he sat moodily staring at the carpet its silly intricacies melted into a blur from which the eyes of Mrs Leath again looked out at him
He saw the fine sweep of her brows and the deep look beneath them as she had turned from him on their last evening in London
This will be good bye then she had said and it occurred to him that her parting phrase had been the same as Sophy Viners
At the thought he jumped to his feet and took down from its hook the coat in which he had left Miss Viners letter
The clock marked the third quarter after midnight and he knew it would make no difference if he went down to the postbox now or early the next morning but he wanted to clear his conscience and having found the letter he went to the door
A sound in the next room made him pause
He had become conscious again that a few feet off on the other side of a thin partition a small keen flame of life was quivering and agitating the air
Sophys face came hack to him insistently
It was as vivid now as Mrs Leaths had been a moment earlier
He recalled with a faint smile of retrospective pleasure the girls enjoyment of her evening and the innumerable fine feelers of sensation she had thrown out to its impressions
It gave him a curiously close sense of her presence to think that at that moment she was living over her enjoyment as intensely as he was living over his unhappiness
His own case was irremediable but it was easy enough to give her a few more hours of pleasure
And did she not perhaps secretly expect it of him
After all if she had been very anxious to join her friends she would have telegraphed them on reaching Paris instead of writing
He wondered now that he had not been struck at the moment by so artless a device to gain more time
The fact of her having practised it did not make him think less well of her it merely strengthened the impulse to use his opportunity
She was starving poor child for a little amusement a little personal lifewhy not give her the chance of another day in Paris
If he did so should he not be merely falling in with her own hopes
At the thought his sympathy for her revived
She became of absorbing interest to him as an escape from himself and an object about which his thwarted activities could cluster
He felt less drearily alone because of her being there on the other side of the door and in his gratitude to her for giving him this relief he began with indolent amusement to plan new ways of detaining her
He dropped back into his chair lit a cigar and smiled a little at the image of her smiling face
He tried to imagine what incident of the day she was likely to be recalling at that particular moment and what part he probably played in it
That it was not a small part he was certain and the knowledge was undeniably pleasant
Now and then a sound from her room brought before him more vividly the reality of the situation and the strangeness of the vast swarming solitude in which he and she were momentarily isolated amid long lines of rooms each holding its separate secret
The nearness of all these other mysteries enclosing theirs gave Darrow a more intimate sense of the girls presence and through the fumes of his cigar his imagination continued to follow her to and fro traced the curve of her slim young arms as she raised them to undo her hair pictured the sliding down of her dress to the waist and then to the knees and the whiteness of her feet as she slipped across the floor to bed
He stood up and shook himself with a yawn throwing away the end of his cigar
His glance in following it lit on the telegram which had dropped to the floor
The sounds in the next room had ceased and once more he felt alone and unhappy
Opening the window he folded his arms on the sill and looked out on the vast lightspangled mass of the city and then up at the dark sky in which the morning planet stood
VI At the Theatre Francais the next afternoon Darrow yawned and fidgeted in his seat
The day was warm the theatre crowded and airless and the performance it seemed to him intolerably bad
He stole a glance at his companion wondering if she shared his feelings
Her rapt profile betrayed no unrest but politeness might have caused her to feign an interest that she did not feel
He leaned back impatiently stifling another yawn and trying to fix his attention on the stage
Great things were going forward there and he was not insensible to the stern beauties of the ancient drama
But the interpretation of the play seemed to him as airless and lifeless as the atmosphere of the theatre
The players were the same whom he had often applauded in those very parts and perhaps that fact added to the impression of staleness and conventionality produced by their performance
Surely it was time to infuse new blood into the veins of the moribund art
He had the impression that the ghosts of actors were giving a spectral performance on the shores of Styx
Certainly it was not the most profitable way for a young man with a pretty companion to pass the golden hours of a spring afternoon
The freshness of the face at his side reflecting the freshness of the season suggested dapplings of sunlight through new leaves the sound of a brook in the grass the ripple of treeshadows over breezy meadows
When at length the fateful march of the cothurns was stayed by the single pause in the play and Darrow had led Miss Viner out on the balcony overhanging the square before the theatre he turned to see if she shared his feelings
But the rapturous look she gave him checked the depreciation on his lips
Oh why did you bring me out here
One ought to creep away and sit in the dark till it begins again
Is THAT the way they made you feel
Didnt they YOUAs if the gods were there all the while just behind them pulling the strings
Her hands were pressed against the railing her face shining and darkening under the wingbeats of successive impressions
Darrow smiled in enjoyment of her pleasure
After all he had felt all that long ago perhaps it was his own fault rather than that of the actors that the poetry of the play seemed to have evaporatedBut no he had been right in judging the performance to be dull and stale it was simply his companions inexperience her lack of occasions to compare and estimate that made her think it brilliant
I was afraid you were bored and wanted to come away
BORED
She made a little aggrieved grimace
You mean you thought me too ignorant and stupid to appreciate it
No not that
The hand nearest him still lay on the railing of the balcony and he covered it for a moment with his
As he did so he saw the colour rise and tremble in her cheek
Tell me just what you think he said bending his head a little and only halfaware of his words
She did not turn her face to his but began to talk rapidly trying to convey something of what she felt
But she was evidently unused to analyzing her aesthetic emotions and the tumultuous rush of the drama seemed to have left her in a state of panting wonder as though it had been a storm or some other natural cataclysm
She had no literary or historic associations to which to attach her impressions her education had evidently not comprised a course in Greek literature
But she felt what would probably have been unperceived by many a young lady who had taken a first in classics the ineluctable fatality of the tale the dread sway in it of the same mysterious luck which pulled the threads of her own small destiny
It was not literature to her it was fact as actual as near by as what was happening to her at the moment and what the next hour held in store
Seen in this light the play regained for Darrow its supreme and poignant reality
He pierced to the heart of its significance through all the artificial accretions with which his theories of art and the conventions of the stage had clothed it and saw it as he had never seen it as life
After this there could be no question of flight and he took her back to the theatre content to receive his own sensations through the medium of hers
But with the continuation of the play and the oppression of the heavy air his attention again began to wander straying back over the incidents of the morning
He had been with Sophy Viner all day and he was surprised to find how quickly the time had gone
She had hardly attempted as the hours passed to conceal her satisfaction on finding that no telegram came from the Farlows
Theyll have written she had simply said and her mind had at once flown on to the golden prospect of an afternoon at the theatre
The intervening hours had been disposed of in a stroll through the lively streets and a repast luxuriously lingered over under the chestnutboughs of a restaurant in the Champs Elysees
Everything entertained and interested her and Darrow remarked with an amused detachment that she was not insensible to the impression her charms produced
Yet there was no hard edge of vanity in her sense of her prettiness she seemed simply to be aware of it as a note in the general harmony and to enjoy sounding the note as a singer enjoys singing
After luncheon as they sat over their coffee she had again asked an immense number of questions and delivered herself of a remarkable variety of opinions
Her questions testified to a wholesome and comprehensive human curiosity and her comments showed like her face and her whole attitude an odd mingling of precocious wisdom and disarming ignorance
When she talked to him about lifethe word was often on her lipsshe seemed to him like a child playing with a tigers cub and he said to himself that some day the child would grow upand so would the tiger
Meanwhile such expertness qualified by such candour made it impossible to guess the extent of her personal experience or to estimate its effect on her character
She might be any one of a dozen definable types or she mightmore disconcertingly to her companion and more perilously to herselfbe a shifting and uncrystallized mixture of them all
Her talk as usual had promptly reverted to the stage
She was eager to learn about every form of dramatic expression which the metropolis of things theatrical had to offer and her curiosity ranged from the official temples of the art to its less hallowed haunts
Her searching enquiries about a play whose production on one of the latter scenes had provoked a considerable amount of scandal led Darrow to throw out laughingly To see THAT youll have to wait till youre married
and his answer had sent her off at a tangent
Oh I never mean to marry she had rejoined in a tone of youthful finality
I seem to have heard that before
Yes from girls whove only got to choose
Her eyes had grown suddenly almost old
Id like you to see the only men whove ever wanted to marry me
One was the doctor on the steamer when I came abroad with the Hokes hed been cashiered from the navy for drunkenness
The other was a deaf widower with three grownup daughters who kept a clockshop in BayswaterBesides she rambled on Im not so sure that I believe in marriage
You see Im all for selfdevelopment and the chance to live ones life
Im awfully modern you know
It was just when she proclaimed herself most awfully modern that she struck him as most helplessly backward yet the moment after without any bravado or apparent desire to assume an attitude she would propound some social axiom which could have been gathered only in the bitter soil of experience
All these things came back to him as he sat beside her in the theatre and watched her ingenuous absorption
It was on the story that her mind was fixed and in life also he suspected it would always be the story rather than its remoter imaginative issues that would hold her
He did not believe there were ever any echoes in her soul
There was no question however that what she felt was felt with intensity to the actual the immediate she spread vibrating strings
When the play was over and they came out once more into the sunlight Darrow looked down at her with a smile
Well
he asked
She made no answer
Her dark gaze seemed to rest on him without seeing him
Her cheeks and lips were pale and the loose hair under her hatbrim clung to her forehead in damp rings
She looked like a young priestess still dazed by the fumes of the cavern
You poor childits been almost too much for you
She shook her head with a vague smile
Come he went on putting his hand on her arm lets jump into a taxi and get some air and sunshine
Look there are hours of daylight left and see what a night its going to be
He pointed over their heads to where a white moon hung in the misty blue above the roofs of the rue de Rivoli
She made no answer and he signed to a motorcab calling out to the driver To the Bois
As the carriage turned toward the Tuileries she roused herself
I must go first to the hotel
There may be a messageat any rate I must decide on something
Darrow saw that the reality of the situation had suddenly forced itself upon her
I MUST decide on something she repeated
He would have liked to postpone the return to persuade her to drive directly to the Bois for dinner
It would have been easy enough to remind her that she could not start for Joigny that evening and that therefore it was of no moment whether she received the Farlows answer then or a few hours later but for some reason he hesitated to use this argument which had come so naturally to him the day before
After all he knew she would find nothing at the hotelso what did it matter if they went there
The porter interrogated was not sure
He himself had received nothing for the lady but in his absence his subordinate might have sent a letter upstairs
Darrow and Sophy mounted together in the lift and the young man while she went into her room unlocked his own door and glanced at the empty table
For him at least no message had come and on her threshold a moment later she met him with the expected Notheres nothing
He feigned an unregretful surprise
So much the better
And now shall we drive out somewhere
Or would you rather take a boat to Bellevue
Have you ever dined there on the terrace by moonlight
Its not at all bad
And theres no earthly use in sitting here waiting
She stood before him in perplexity
But when I wrote yesterday I asked them to telegraph
I suppose theyre horribly hard up the poor dears and they thought a letter would do as well as a telegram
The colour had risen to her face
Thats why I wrote instead of telegraphing I havent a penny to spare myself
Nothing she could have said could have filled her listener with a deeper contrition
He felt the red in his own face as he recalled the motive with which he had credited her in his midnight musings
But that motive after all had simply been trumped up to justify his own disloyalty he had never really believed in it
The reflection deepened his confusion and he would have liked to take her hand in his and confess the injustice he had done her
She may have interpreted his change of colour as an involuntary protest at being initiated into such shabby details for she went on with a laugh I suppose you can hardly understand what it means to have to stop and think whether one can afford a telegram
But Ive always had to consider such things
And I mustnt stay here any longer nowI must try to get a night train for Joigny
Even if the Farlows cant take me in I can go to the hotel it will cost less than staying here
She paused again and then exclaimed I ought to have thought of that sooner I ought to have telegraphed yesterday
But I was sure I should hear from them today and I wantedoh I DID so awfully want to stay
She threw a troubled look at Darrow
Do you happen to remember she asked what time it was when you posted my letter
VII Darrow was still standing on her threshold
As she put the question he entered the room and closed the door behind him
His heart was beating a little faster than usual and he had no clear idea of what he was about to do or say beyond the definite conviction that whatever passing impulse of expiation moved him he would not be fool enough to tell her that he had not sent her letter
He knew that most wrongdoing works on the whole less mischief than its useless confession and this was clearly a case where a passing folly might be turned by avowal into a serious offense
Im so sorryso sorry but you must let me help youYou will let me help you
he said
He took her hands and pressed them together between his counting on a friendly touch to help out the insufficiency of words
He felt her yield slightly to his clasp and hurried on without giving her time to answer
Isnt it a pity to spoil our good time together by regretting anything you might have done to prevent our having it
She drew back freeing her hands
Her face losing its look of appealing confidence was suddenly sharpened by distrust
You didnt forget to post my letter
Darrow stood before her constrained and ashamed and ever more keenly aware that the betrayal of his distress must be a greater offense than its concealment
What an insinuation
he cried throwing out his hands with a laugh
Her face instantly melted to laughter
Well thenI WONT be sorry I wont regret anything except that our good time is over
The words were so unexpected that they routed all his resolves
If she had gone on doubting him he could probably have gone on deceiving her but her unhesitating acceptance of his word made him hate the part he was playing
At the same moment a doubt shot up its serpenthead in his own bosom
Was it not he rather than she who was childishly trustful
Was she not almost too ready to take his word and dismiss once for all the tiresome question of the letter
Considering what her experiences must have been such trustfulness seemed open to suspicion
But the moment his eyes fell on her he was ashamed of the thought and knew it for what it really was another pretext to lessen his own delinquency
Why should our good time be over
he asked
Why shouldnt it last a little longer
She looked up her lips parted in surprise but before she could speak he went on I want you to stay with meI want you just for a few days to have all the things youve never had
Its not always May and Pariswhy not make the most of them now
You know mewere not strangerswhy shouldnt you treat me like a friend
While he spoke she had drawn away a little but her hand still lay in his
She was pale and her eyes were fixed on him in a gaze in which there was neither distrust or resentment but only an ingenuous wonder
He was extraordinarily touched by her expression
Oh do
You must
Listen to prove that Im sincere Ill tell youIll tell you I didnt post your letterI didnt post it because I wanted so much to give you a few good hoursand because I couldnt bear to have you go
He had the feeling that the words were being uttered in spite of him by some malicious witness of the scene and yet that he was not sorry to have them spoken
The girl had listened to him in silence
She remained motionless for a moment after he had ceased to speak then she snatched away her hand
You didnt post my letter
You kept it back on purpose
And you tell me so NOW to prove to me that Id better put myself under your protection
She burst into a laugh that had in it all the piercing echoes of her Murrett past and her face at the same moment underwent the same change shrinking into a small malevolent white mask in which the eyes burned black
Thank youthank you most awfully for telling me
And for all your other kind intentions
The plans delightfulreally quite delightful and Im extremely flattered and obliged
She dropped into a seat beside her dressingtable resting her chin on her lifted hands and laughing out at him under the elflock which had shaken itself down over her eyes
Her outburst did not offend the young man its immediate effect was that of allaying his agitation
The theatrical touch in her manner made his offense seem more venial than he had thought it a moment before
He drew up a chair and sat down beside her
After all he said in a tone of goodhumoured protest I neednt have told you Id kept back your letter and my telling you seems rather strong proof that I hadnt any very nefarious designs on you
She met this with a shrug but he did not give her time to answer
My designs he continued with a smile were not nefarious
I saw youd been through a bad time with Mrs Murrett and that there didnt seem to be much fun ahead for you and I didnt seeand I dont yet seethe harm of trying to give you a few hours of amusement between a depressing past and a not particularly cheerful future
He paused again and then went on in the same tone of friendly reasonableness The mistake I made was not to tell you this at oncenot to ask you straight out to give me a day or two and let me try to make you forget all the things that are troubling you
I was a fool not to see that if Id put it to you in that way youd have accepted or refused as you chose but that at least you wouldnt have mistaken my intentionsIntentions
He stood up walked the length of the room and turned back to where she still sat motionless her elbows propped on the dressingtable her chin on her hands
What rubbish we talk about intentions
The truth is I hadnt any I just liked being with you
Perhaps you dont know how extraordinarily one can like being with youI was depressed and adrift myself and you made me forget my bothers and when I found you were goingand going back to dreariness as I wasI didnt see why we shouldnt have a few hours together first so I left your letter in my pocket
He saw her face melt as she listened and suddenly she unclasped her hands and leaned to him
But are YOU unhappy too
Oh I never understoodI never dreamed it
I thought youd always had everything in the world you wanted
Darrow broke into a laugh at this ingenuous picture of his state
He was ashamed of trying to better his case by an appeal to her pity and annoyed with himself for alluding to a subject he would rather have kept out of his thoughts
But her look of sympathy had disarmed him his heart was bitter and distracted she was near him her eyes were shining with compassionhe bent over her and kissed her hand
Forgive medo forgive me he said
She stood up with a smiling headshake
Oh its not so often that people try to give me any pleasuremuch less two whole days of it
I shant forget how kind youve been
I shall have plenty of time to remember
But this IS good bye you know
I must telegraph at once to say Im coming
To say youre coming
Then Im not forgiven
Oh youre forgivenif thats any comfort
Its not the very least if your way of proving it is to go away
She hung her head in meditation
But I cant stayHow CAN I stay
she broke out as if arguing with some unseen monitor
Why cant you
No one knows youre hereNo one need ever know
She looked up and their eyes exchanged meanings for a rapid minute
Her gaze was as clear as a boys
Oh its not THAT she exclaimed almost impatiently its not people Im afraid of
Theyve never put themselves out for mewhy on earth should I care about them
He liked her directness as he had never liked it before
Well then what is it
Not ME I hope
No not you I like you
Its the money
With me thats always the root of the matter
I could never yet afford a treat in my life
Is THAT all
He laughed relieved by her naturalness
Look here since we re talking as man to mancant you trust me about that too
Trust you
How do you mean
Youd better not trust ME
she laughed back sharply
I might never be able to pay up
His gesture brushed aside the allusion
Money may be the root of the matter it cant be the whole of it between friends
Dont you think one friend may accept a small service from another without looking too far ahead or weighing too many chances
The question turns entirely on what you think of me
If you like me well enough to be willing to take a few days holiday with me just for the pleasure of the thing and the pleasure youll be giving me lets shake hands on it
If you dont like me well enough well shake hands too only I shall be sorry he ended
Oh but I shall be sorry too
Her face as she lifted it to his looked so small and young that Darrow felt a fugitive twinge of compunction instantly effaced by the excitement of pursuit
Well then
He stood looking down on her his eyes persuading her
He was now intensely aware that his nearness was having an effect which made it less and less necessary for him to choose his words and he went on more mindful of the inflections of his voice than of what he was actually saying Why on earth should we say goodbye if were both sorry to
Wont you tell me your reason
Its not a bit like you to let anything stand in the way of your saying just what you feel
You mustnt mind offending me you know
She hung before him like a leaf on the meeting of cross currents that the next ripple may sweep forward or whirl back
Then she flung up her head with the odd boyish movement habitual to her in moments of excitement
What I feel
Do you want to know what I feel
That youre giving me the only chance Ive ever had
She turned about on her heel and dropping into the nearest chair sank forward her face hidden against the dressing table
Under the folds of her thin summer dress the modelling of her back and of her lifted arms and the slight hollow between her shoulderblades recalled the faint curves of a terracotta statuette some young image of grace hardly more than sketched in the clay
Darrow as he stood looking at her reflected that her character for all its seeming firmness its flashing edges of opinion was probably no less immature
He had not expected her to yield so suddenly to his suggestion or to confess her yielding in that way
At first he was slightly disconcerted then he saw how her attitude simplified his own
Her behaviour had all the indecision and awkwardness of inexperience
It showed that she was a child after all and all he could doall he had ever meant to dowas to give her a childs holiday to look back to
For a moment he fancied she was crying but the next she was on her feet and had swept round on him a face she must have turned away only to hide the first rush of her pleasure
For a while they shone on each other without speaking then she sprang to him and held out both hands
Is it true
Is it really true
Is it really going to happen to ME
He felt like answering Youre the very creature to whom it was bound to happen but the words had a double sense that made him wince and instead he caught her proffered hands and stood looking at her across the length of her arms without attempting to bend them or to draw her closer
He wanted her to know how her words had moved him but his thoughts were blurred by the rush of the same emotion that possessed her and his own words came with an effort
He ended by giving her back a laugh as frank as her own and declaring as he dropped her hands All that and more too youll see
VIII All day since the late reluctant dawn the rain had come down in torrents
It streamed against Darrows highperched windows reduced their vast prospect of roofs and chimneys to a black oily huddle and filled the room with the drab twilight of an underground aquarium
The streams descended with the regularity of a third days rain when trimming and shuffling are over and the weather has settled down to do its worst
There were no variations of rhythm no lyrical ups and downs the grey lines streaking the panes were as dense and uniform as a page of unparagraphed narrative
George Darrow had drawn his armchair to the fire
The time table he had been studying lay on the floor and he sat staring with dull acquiescence into the boundless blur of rain which affected him like a vast projection of his own state of mind
Then his eyes travelled slowly about the room
It was exactly ten days since his hurried unpacking had strewn it with the contents of his portmanteaux
His brushes and razors were spread out on the blotched marble of the chest of drawers
A stack of newspapers had accumulated on the centre table under the electrolier and half a dozen paper novels lay on the mantelpiece among cigarcases and toilet bottles but these traces of his passage had made no mark on the featureless dulness of the room its look of being the makeshift setting of innumerable transient collocations
There was something sardonic almost sinister in its appearance of having deliberately made up for its anonymous part all in noncommittal drabs and browns with a carpet and paper that nobody would remember and chairs and tables as impersonal as railway porters
Darrow picked up the timetable and tossed it on to the table
Then he rose to his feet lit a cigar and went to the window
Through the rain he could just discover the face of a clock in a tall building beyond the railway roofs
He pulled out his watch compared the two timepieces and started the hands of his with such a rush that they flew past the hour and he had to make them repeat the circuit more deliberately
He felt a quite disproportionate irritation at the trifling blunder
When he had corrected it he went back to his chair and threw himself down leaning back his head against his hands
Presently his cigar went out and he got up hunted for the matches lit it again and returned to his seat
The room was getting on his nerves
During the first few days while the skies were clear he had not noticed it or had felt for it only the contemptuous indifference of the traveller toward a provisional shelter
But now that he was leaving it was looking at it for the last time it seemed to have taken complete possession of his mind to be soaking itself into him like an ugly indelible blot
Every detail pressed itself on his notice with the familiarity of an accidental confidant whichever way he turned he felt the nudge of a transient intimacy
The one fixed point in his immediate future was that his leave was over and that he must be back at his post in London the next morning
Within twentyfour hours he would again be in a daylight world of recognized activities himself a busy responsible relatively necessary factor in the big whirring social and official machine
That fixed obligation was the fact he could think of with the least discomfort yet for some unaccountable reason it was the one on which he found it most difficult to fix his thoughts
Whenever he did so the room jerked him back into the circle of its insistent associations
It was extraordinary with what a microscopic minuteness of loathing he hated it all the grimy carpet and wallpaper the black marble mantel piece the clock with a gilt allegory under a dusty bell the highbolstered browncounterpaned bed the framed card of printed rules under the electric light switch and the door of communication with the next room
He hated the door most of all At the outset he had felt no special sense of responsibility
He was satisfied that he had struck the right note and convinced of his power of sustaining it
The whole incident had somehow seemed in spite of its vulgar setting and its inevitable prosaic propinquities to be enacting itself in some unmapped region outside the pale of the usual
It was not like anything that had ever happened to him before or in which he had ever pictured himself as likely to be involved but that at first had seemed no argument against his fitness to deal with it
Perhaps but for the three days rain he might have got away without a doubt as to his adequacy
The rain had made all the difference
It had thrown the whole picture out of perspective blotted out the mystery of the remoter planes and the enchantment of the middle distance and thrust into prominence every commonplace fact of the foreground
It was the kind of situation that was not helped by being thought over and by the perversity of circumstance he had been forced into the unwilling contemplation of its every aspect His cigar had gone out again and he threw it into the fire and vaguely meditated getting up to find another
But the mere act of leaving his chair seemed to call for a greater exertion of the will than he was capable of and he leaned his head back with closed eyes and listened to the drumming of the rain
A different noise aroused him
It was the opening and closing of the door leading from the corridor into the adjoining room
He sat motionless without opening his eyes but now another sight forced itself under his lowered lids
It was the precise photographic picture of that other room
Everything in it rose before him and pressed itself upon his vision with the same acuity of distinctness as the objects surrounding him
A step sounded on the floor and he knew which way the step was directed what pieces of furniture it had to skirt where it would probably pause and what was likely to arrest it
He heard another sound and recognized it as that of a wet umbrella placed in the black marble jamb of the chimneypiece against the hearth
He caught the creak of a hinge and instantly differentiated it as that of the wardrobe against the opposite wall
Then he heard the mouselike squeal of a reluctant drawer and knew it was the upper one in the chest of drawers beside the bed the clatter which followed was caused by the mahogany toiletglass jumping on its loosened pivots
The step crossed the floor again
It was strange how much better he knew it than the person to whom it belonged
Now it was drawing near the door of communication between the two rooms
He opened his eyes and looked
The step had ceased and for a moment there was silence
Then he heard a low knock
He made no response and after an interval he saw that the door handle was being tentatively turned
He closed his eyes once more
The door opened and the step was in the room coming cautiously toward him
He kept his eyes shut relaxing his body to feign sleep
There was another pause then a wavering soft advance the rustle of a dress behind his chair the warmth of two hands pressed for a moment on his lids
The palms of the hands had the lingering scent of some stuff that he had bought on the BoulevardHe looked up and saw a letter falling over his shoulder to his knee Did I disturb you
Im so sorry
They gave me this just now when I came in
The letter before he could catch it had slipped between his knees to the floor
It lay there address upward at his feet and while he sat staring down at the strong slender characters on the bluegray envelope an arm reached out from behind to pick it up
Oh dontDONT broke from him and he bent over and caught the arm
The face above it was close to his
Dont what
take the trouble he stammered
He dropped the arm and stooped down
His grasp closed over the letter he fingered its thickness and weight and calculated the number of sheets it must contain
Suddenly he felt the pressure of the hand on his shoulder and became aware that the face was still leaning over him and that in a moment he would have to look up and kiss it
He bent forward first and threw the unopened letter into the middle of the fire
BOOK II IX The light of the October afternoon lay on an old highroofed house which enclosed in its long expanse of brick and yellowish stone the breadth of a grassy court filled with the shadow and sound of limes
From the escutcheoned piers at the entrance of the court a level drive also shaded by limes extended to a white barred gate beyond which an equally level avenue of grass cut through a wood dwindled to a bluegreen blur against a sky banked with still white slopes of cloud
In the court halfway between house and drive a lady stood
She held a parasol above her head and looked now at the housefront with its double flight of steps meeting before a glazed door under sculptured trophies now down the drive toward the grassy cutting through the wood
Her air was less of expectancy than of contemplation she seemed not so much to be watching for any one or listening for an approaching sound as letting the whole aspect of the place sink into her while she held herself open to its influence
Yet it was no less apparent that the scene was not new to her
There was no eagerness of investigation in her survey she seemed rather to be looking about her with eyes to which for some intimate inward reason details long since familiar had suddenly acquired an unwonted freshness
This was in fact the exact sensation of which Mrs Leath was conscious as she came forth from the house and descended into the sunlit court
She had come to meet her stepson who was likely to be returning at that hour from an afternoons shooting in one of the more distant plantations and she carried in her hand the letter which had sent her in search of him but with her first step out of the house all thought of him had been effaced by another series of impressions
The scene about her was known to satiety
She had seen Givre at all seasons of the year and for the greater part of every year since the faroff day of her marriage the day when ostensibly driving through its gates at her husbands side she had actually been carried there on a cloud of iriswinged visions
The possibilities which the place had then represented were still vividly present to her
The mere phrase a French chateau had called up to her youthful fancy a throng of romantic associations poetic pictorial and emotional and the serene face of the old house seated in its park among the poplarbordered meadows of middle France had seemed on her first sight of it to hold out to her a fate as noble and dignified as its own mien
Though she could still call up that phase of feeling it had long since passed and the house had for a time become to her the very symbol of narrowness and monotony
Then with the passing of years it had gradually acquired a less inimical character had become not again a castle of dreams evoker of fair images and romantic legend but the shell of a life slowly adjusted to its dwelling the place one came back to the place where one had ones duties ones habits and ones books the place one would naturally live in till one died a dull house an inconvenient house of which one knew all the defects the shabbinesses the discomforts but to which one was so used that one could hardly after so long a time think ones self away from it without suffering a certain loss of identity
Now as it lay before her in the autumn mildness its mistress was surprised at her own insensibility
She had been trying to see the house through the eyes of an old friend who the next morning would be driving up to it for the first time and in so doing she seemed to be opening her own eyes upon it after a long interval of blindness
The court was very still yet full of a latent life the wheeling and rustling of pigeons about the rectangular yews and across the sunny gravel the sweep of rooks above the lustrous greyishpurple slates of the roof and the stir of the treetops as they met the breeze which every day at that hour came punctually up from the river
Just such a latent animation glowed in Anna Leath
In every nerve and vein she was conscious of that equipoise of bliss which the fearful human heart scarce dares acknowledge
She was not used to strong or full emotions but she had always known that she should not be afraid of them
She was not afraid now but she felt a deep inward stillness
The immediate effect of the feeling had been to send her forth in quest of her stepson
She wanted to stroll back with him and have a quiet talk before they reentered the house
It was always easy to talk to him and at this moment he was the one person to whom she could have spoken without fear of disturbing her inner stillness
She was glad for all sorts of reasons that Madame de Chantelle and Effie were still at Ouchy with the governess and that she and Owen had the house to themselves
And she was glad that even he was not yet in sight
She wanted to be alone a little longer not to think but to let the long slow waves of joy break over her one by one
She walked out of the court and sat down on one of the benches that bordered the drive
From her seat she had a diagonal view of the long housefront and of the domed chapel terminating one of the wings
Beyond a gate in the courtyard wall the flowergarden drew its darkgreen squares and raised its statues against the yellowing background of the park
In the borders only a few late pinks and crimsons smouldered but a peacock strutting in the sun seemed to have gathered into his outspread fan all the summer glories of the place
In Mrs Leaths hand was the letter which had opened her eyes to these things and a smile rose to her lips at the mere feeling of the paper between her fingers
The thrill it sent through her gave a keener edge to every sense
She felt saw breathed the shining world as though a thin impenetrable veil had suddenly been removed from it
Just such a veil she now perceived had always hung between herself and life
It had been like the stage gauze which gives an illusive air of reality to the painted scene behind it yet proves it after all to be no more than a painted scene
She had been hardly aware in her girlhood of differing from others in this respect
In the wellregulated wellfed Summers world the unusual was regarded as either immoral or illbred and people with emotions were not visited
Sometimes with a sense of groping in a topsyturvy universe Anna had wondered why everybody about her seemed to ignore all the passions and sensations which formed the stuff of great poetry and memorable action
In a community composed entirely of people like her parents and her parents friends she did not see how the magnificent things one read about could ever have happened
She was sure that if anything of the kind had occurred in her immediate circle her mother would have consulted the family clergyman and her father perhaps even have rung up the police and her sense of humour compelled her to own that in the given conditions these precautions might not have been unjustified
Little by little the conditions conquered her and she learned to regard the substance of life as a mere canvas for the embroideries of poet and painter and its little swept and fenced and tended surface as its actual substance
It was in the visioned region of action and emotion that her fullest hours were spent but it hardly occurred to her that they might be translated into experience or connected with anything likely to happen to a young lady living in West Fifty fifth Street
She perceived indeed that other girls leading outwardly the same life as herself and seemingly unaware of her world of hidden beauty were yet possessed of some vital secret which escaped her
There seemed to be a kind of freemasonry between them they were wider awake than she more alert and surer of their wants if not of their opinions
She supposed they were cleverer and accepted her inferiority goodhumouredly half aware within herself of a reserve of unused power which the others gave no sign of possessing
This partly consoled her for missing so much of what made their good time but the resulting sense of exclusion of being somehow laughingly but firmly debarred from a share of their privileges threw her back on herself and deepened the reserve which made envious mothers cite her as a model of ladylike repression
Love she told herself would one day release her from this spell of unreality
She was persuaded that the sublime passion was the key to the enigma but it was difficult to relate her conception of love to the forms it wore in her experience
Two or three of the girls she had envied for their superior acquaintance with the arts of life had contracted in the course of time what were variously described as romantic or foolish marriages one even made a runaway match and languished for a while under a cloud of social reprobation
Here then was passion in action romance converted to reality yet the heroines of these exploits returned from them untransfigured and their husbands were as dull as ever when one had to sit next to them at dinner
Her own case of course would be different
Some day she would find the magic bridge between West Fiftyfifth Street and life once or twice she had even fancied that the clue was in her hand
The first time was when she had met young Darrow
She recalled even now the stir of the encounter
But his passion swept over her like a wind that shakes the roof of the forest without reaching its still glades or rippling its hidden pools
He was extraordinarily intelligent and agreeable and her heart beat faster when he was with her
He had a tall fair easy presence and a mind in which the lights of irony played pleasantly through the shades of feeling
She liked to hear his voice almost as much as to listen to what he was saying and to listen to what he was saying almost as much as to feel that he was looking at her but he wanted to kiss her and she wanted to talk to him about books and pictures and have him insinuate the eternal theme of their love into every subject they discussed
Whenever they were apart a reaction set in
She wondered how she could have been so cold called herself a prude and an idiot questioned if any man could really care for her and got up in the dead of night to try new ways of doing her hair
But as soon as he reappeared her head straightened itself on her slim neck and she sped her little shafts of irony or flew her little kites of erudition while hot and cold waves swept over her and the things she really wanted to say choked in her throat and burned the palms of her hands
Often she told herself that any silly girl who had waltzed through a season would know better than she how to attract a man and hold him but when she said a man she did not really mean George Darrow
Then one day at a dinner she saw him sitting next to one of the silly girls in question the heroine of the elopement which had shaken West Fiftyfifth Street to its base
The young lady had come back from her adventure no less silly than when she went and across the table the partner of her flight a fat young man with eyeglasses sat stolidly eating terrapin and talking about polo and investments
The young woman was undoubtedly as silly as ever yet after watching her for a few minutes Miss Summers perceived that she had somehow grown luminous perilous obscurely menacing to nice girls and the young men they intended eventually to accept
Suddenly at the sight a rage of possessorship awoke in her
She must save Darrow assert her right to him at any price
Pride and reticence went down in a hurricane of jealousy
She heard him laugh and there was something new in his laughShe watched him talking talkingHe sat slightly sideways a faint smile beneath his lids lowering his voice as he lowered it when he talked to her
She caught the same inflections but his eyes were different
It would have offended her once if he had looked at her like that
Now her one thought was that none but she had a right to be so looked at
And that girl of all others
What illusions could he have about a girl who hardly a year ago had made a fool of herself over the fat young man stolidly eating terrapin across the table
If that was where romance and passion ended it was better to take to district visiting or algebra
All night she lay awake and wondered What was she saying to him
How shall I learn to say such things
and she decided that her heart would tell herthat the next time they were alone together the irresistible word would spring to her lips
He came the next day and they were alone and all she found was I didnt know that you and Kitty Mayne were such friends
He answered with indifference that he didnt know it either and in the reaction of relief she declared Shes certainly ever so much prettier than she was Shes rather good fun he admitted as though he had not noticed her other advantages and suddenly Anna saw in his eyes the look she had seen there the previous evening
She felt as if he were leagues and leagues away from her
All her hopes dissolved and she was conscious of sitting rigidly with high head and straight lips while the irresistible word fled with a last wingbeat into the golden mist of her illusions She was still quivering with the pain and bewilderment of this adventure when Fraser Leath appeared
She met him first in Italy where she was travelling with her parents and the following winter he came to New York
In Italy he had seemed interesting in New York he became remarkable
He seldom spoke of his life in Europe and let drop but the most incidental allusions to the friends the tastes the pursuits which filled his cosmopolitan days but in the atmosphere of West Fiftyfifth Street he seemed the embodiment of a storied past
He presented Miss Summers with a prettilybound anthology of the old French poets and when she showed a discriminating pleasure in the gift observed with his grave smile I didnt suppose I should find any one here who would feel about these things as I do
On another occasion he asked her acceptance of a half effaced eighteenth century pastel which he had surprisingly picked up in a New York auctionroom
I know no one but you who would really appreciate it he explained
He permitted himself no other comments but these conveyed with sufficient directness that he thought her worthy of a different setting
That she should be so regarded by a man living in an atmosphere of art and beauty and esteeming them the vital elements of life made her feel for the first time that she was understood
Here was some one whose scale of values was the same as hers and who thought her opinion worth hearing on the very matters which they both considered of supreme importance
The discovery restored her self confidence and she revealed herself to Mr Leath as she had never known how to reveal herself to Darrow
As the courtship progressed and they grew more confidential her suitor surprised and delighted her by little explosions of revolutionary sentiment
He said Shall you mind I wonder if I tell you that you live in a dreadfully conventional atmosphere
and seeing that she manifestly did not mind Of course I shall say things now and then that will horrify your dear delightful parentsI shall shock them awfully I warn you
In confirmation of this warning he permitted himself an occasional playful fling at the regular churchgoing of Mr and Mrs Summers at the innocuous character of the literature in their library and at their guileless appreciations in art
He even ventured to banter Mrs Summers on her refusal to receive the irrepressible Kitty Mayne who after a rapid passage with George Darrow was now involved in another and more flagrant adventure
In Europe you know the husband is regarded as the only judge in such matters
As long as he accepts the situation  Mr Leath explained to Anna who took his view the more emphatically in order to convince herself that personally she had none but the most tolerant sentiments toward the lady
The subversiveness of Mr Leaths opinions was enhanced by the distinction of his appearance and the reserve of his manners
He was like the anarchist with a gardenia in his buttonhole who figures in the higher melodrama
Every word every allusion every note of his agreeablymodulated voice gave Anna a glimpse of a society at once freer and finer which observed the traditional forms but had discarded the underlying prejudices whereas the world she knew had discarded many of the forms and kept almost all the prejudices
In such an atmosphere as his an eager young woman curious as to all the manifestations of life yet instinctively desiring that they should come to her in terms of beauty and fine feeling must surely find the largest scope for self expression
Study travel the contact of the world the comradeship of a polished and enlightened mind would combine to enrich her days and form her character and it was only in the rare moments when Mr Leaths symmetrical blond mask bent over hers and his kiss dropped on her like a cold smooth pebble that she questioned the completeness of the joys he offered
There had been a time when the walls on which her gaze now rested had shed a glare of irony on these early dreams
In the first years of her marriage the sober symmetry of Givre had suggested only her husbands neatlybalanced mind
It was a mind she soon learned contentedly absorbed in formulating the conventions of the unconventional
West Fiftyfifth Street was no more conscientiously concerned than Givre with the momentous question of what people did it was only the type of deed investigated that was different
Mr Leath collected his social instances with the same seriousness and patience as his snuffboxes
He exacted a rigid conformity to his rules of nonconformity and his scepticism had the absolute accent of a dogma
He even cherished certain exceptions to his rules as the book collector prizes a defective first edition
The Protestant churchgoing of Annas parents had provoked his gentle sarcasm but he prided himself on his mothers devoutness because Madame de Chantelle in embracing her second husbands creed had become part of a society which still observes the outward rites of piety
Anna in fact had discovered in her amiable and elegant motherinlaw an unexpected embodiment of the West Fifty fifth Street ideal
Mrs Summers and Madame de Chantelle however strongly they would have disagreed as to the authorized source of Christian dogma would have found themselves completely in accord on all the momentous minutiae of drawingroom conduct yet Mr Leath treated his mothers foibles with a respect which Annas experience of him forbade her to attribute wholly to filial affection
In the early days when she was still questioning the Sphinx instead of trying to find an answer to it she ventured to tax her husband with his inconsistency
You say your mother wont like it if I call on that amusing little woman who came here the other day and was let in by mistake but Madame de Chantelle tells me she lives with her husband and when mother refused to visit Kitty Mayne you said Mr Leaths smile arrested her
My dear child I dont pretend to apply the principles of logic to my poor mothers prejudices
But if you admit that they ARE prejudices
There are prejudices and prejudices
My mother of course got hers from Monsieur de Chantelle and they seem to me as much in their place in this house as the potpourri in your hawthorn jar
They preserve a social tradition of which I should be sorry to lose the least perfume
Of course I dont expect you just at first to feel the difference to see the nuance
In the case of little Madame de Vireville for instance you point out that shes still under her husbands roof
Very true and if she were merely a Paris acquaintanceespecially if you had met her as one still might in the RIGHT KIND of house in ParisI should be the last to object to your visiting her
But in the country its different
Even the best provincial society is what you would call narrow I dont deny it and if some of our friends met Madame de Vireville at Givre well it would produce a bad impression
Youre inclined to ridicule such considerations but gradually youll come to see their importance and meanwhile do trust me when I ask you to be guided by my mother
It is always well for a stranger in an old society to err a little on the side of what you call its prejudices but I should rather describe as its traditions
After that she no longer tried to laugh or argue her husband out of his convictions
They WERE convictions and therefore unassailable
Nor was any insincerity implied in the fact that they sometimes seemed to coincide with hers
There were occasions when he really did look at things as she did but for reasons so different as to make the distance between them all the greater
Life to Mr Leath was like a walk through a carefully classified museum where in moments of doubt one had only to look at the number and refer to ones catalogue to his wife it was like groping about in a huge dark lumberroom where the exploring ray of curiosity lit up now some shape of breathing beauty and now a mummys grin
In the first bewilderment of her new state these discoveries had had the effect of dropping another layer of gauze between herself and reality
She seemed farther than ever removed from the strong joys and pangs for which she felt herself made
She did not adopt her husbands views but insensibly she began to live his life
She tried to throw a compensating ardour into the secret excursions of her spirit and thus the old vicious distinction between romance and reality was reestablished for her and she resigned herself again to the belief that real life was neither real nor alive
The birth of her little girl swept away this delusion
At last she felt herself in contact with the actual business of living but even this impression was not enduring
Everything but the irreducible crude fact of childbearing assumed in the Leath household the same ghostly tinge of unreality
Her husband at the time was all that his own ideal of a husband required
He was attentive and even suitably moved but as he sat by her bedside and thoughtfully proffered to her the list of people who had called to enquire she looked first at him and then at the child between them and wondered at the blundering alchemy of Nature With the exception of the little girl herself everything connected with that time had grown curiously remote and unimportant
The days that had moved so slowly as they passed seemed now to have plunged down headlong steeps of time and as she sat in the autumn sun with Darrows letter in her hand the history of Anna Leath appeared to its heroine like some grey shadowy tale that she might have read in an old book one night as she was falling asleep X Two brown blurs emerging from the farther end of the wood vista gradually defined themselves as her stepson and an attendant gamekeeper
They grew slowly upon the bluish background with occasional delays and reeffacements and she sat still waiting till they should reach the gate at the end of the drive where the keeper would turn off to his cottage and Owen continue on to the house
She watched his approach with a smile
From the first days of her marriage she had been drawn to the boy but it was not until after Effies birth that she had really begun to know him
The eager observation of her own child had shown her how much she had still to learn about the slight fair boy whom the holidays periodically restored to Givre
Owen even then both physically and morally furnished her with the oddest of commentaries on his fathers mien and mind
He would never the family sighingly recognized be nearly as handsome as Mr Leath but his rather charmingly unbalanced face with its brooding forehead and petulant boyish smile suggested to Anna what his fathers countenance might have been could one have pictured its neat features disordered by a rattling breeze
She even pushed the analogy farther and descried in her stepsons mind a quaintlytwisted reflection of her husbands
With his bursts of doorslamming activity his fits of bookish indolence his crude revolutionary dogmatizing and his flashes of precocious irony the boy was not unlike a boisterous embodiment of his fathers theories
It was as though Fraser Leaths ideas accustomed to hang like marionettes on their pegs should suddenly come down and walk
There were moments indeed when Owens humours must have suggested to his progenitor the gambols of an infant Frankenstein but to Anna they were the voice of her secret rebellions and her tenderness to her stepson was partly based on her severity toward herself
As he had the courage she had lacked so she meant him to have the chances she had missed and every effort she made for him helped to keep her own hopes alive
Her interest in Owen led her to think more often of his mother and sometimes she would slip away and stand alone before her predecessors portrait
Since her arrival at Givre the picturea fulllength by a once fashionable artisthad undergone the successive displacements of an exiled consort removed farther and farther from the throne and Anna could not help noting that these stages coincided with the gradual decline of the artists fame
She had a fancy that if his credit had been in the ascendant the first Mrs Leath might have continued to throne over the drawing room mantel piece even to the exclusion of her successors effigy
Instead of this her peregrinations had finally landed her in the shrouded solitude of the billiardroom an apartment which no one ever entered but where it was understood that the light was better or might have been if the shutters had not been always closed
Here the poor lady elegantly dressed and seated in the middle of a large lonely canvas in the blank contemplation of a gilt console had always seemed to Anna to be waiting for visitors who never came
Of course they never came you poor thing
I wonder how long it took you to find out that they never would
Anna had more than once apostrophized her with a derision addressed rather to herself than to the dead but it was only after Effies birth that it occurred to her to study more closely the face in the picture and speculate on the kind of visitors that Owens mother might have hoped for
She certainly doesnt look as if they would have been the same kind as mine but theres no telling from a portrait that was so obviously done to please the family and that leaves Owen so unaccounted for
Well they never came the visitors they never came and she died of it
She died of it long before they buried her Im certain of that
Those are stonedead eyes in the pictureThe loneliness must have been awful if even Owen couldnt keep her from dying of it
And to feel it so she must have HAD feelings real live ones the kind that twitch and tug
And all she had to look at all her life was a gilt consoleyes thats it a gilt console screwed to the wall
Thats exactly and absolutely what he is
She did not mean if she could help it that either Effie or Owen should know that loneliness or let her know it again
They were three now to keep each other warm and she embraced both children in the same passion of motherhood as though one were not enough to shield her from her predecessors fate
Sometimes she fancied that Owen Leaths response was warmer than that of her own child
But then Effie was still hardly more than a baby and Owen from the first had been almost old enough to understand certainly DID understand now in a tacit way that yet perpetually spoke to her
This sense of his understanding was the deepest element in their feeling for each other
There were so many things between them that were never spoken of or even indirectly alluded to yet that even in their occasional discussions and differences formed the unadduced arguments making for final agreement Musing on this she continued to watch his approach and her heart began to beat a little faster at the thought of what she had to say to him
But when he reached the gate she saw him pause and after a moment he turned aside as if to gain a crossroad through the park
She started up and waved her sunshade but he did not see her
No doubt he meant to go back with the gamekeeper perhaps to the kennels to see a retriever who had hurt his leg
Suddenly she was seized by the whim to overtake him
She threw down the parasol thrust her letter into her bodice and catching up her skirts began to run
She was slight and light with a natural ease and quickness of gait but she could not recall having run a yard since she had romped with Owen in his schooldays nor did she know what impulse moved her now
She only knew that run she must that no other motion short of flight would have been buoyant enough for her humour
She seemed to be keeping pace with some inward rhythm seeking to give bodily expression to the lyric rush of her thoughts
The earth always felt elastic under her and she had a conscious joy in treading it but never had it been as soft and springy as today
It seemed actually to rise and meet her as she went so that she had the feeling which sometimes came to her in dreams of skimming miraculously over short bright waves
The air too seemed to break in waves against her sweeping by on its current all the slanted lights and moist sharp perfumes of the failing day
She panted to herself This is nonsense
her blood hummed back But its glorious
and she sped on till she saw that Owen had caught sight of her and was striding back in her direction
Then she stopped and waited flushed and laughing her hands clasped against the letter in her breast
No Im not mad she called out but theres something in the air todaydont you feel itAnd I wanted to have a little talk with you she added as he came up to her smiling at him and linking her arm in his
He smiled back but above the smile she saw the shade of anxiety which for the last two months had kept its fixed line between his handsome eyes
Owen dont look like that
I dont want you to
she said imperiously
He laughed
You said that exactly like Effie
What do you want me to do
To race with you as I do Effie
But I shouldnt have a show
he protested still with the little frown between his eyes
Where are you going
she asked
To the kennels
But theres not the least need
The vet has seen Garry and hes all right
If theres anything you wanted to tell me Did I say there was
I just came out to meet youI wanted to know if youd had good sport
The shadow dropped on him again
None at all
The fact is I didnt try
Jean and I have just been knocking about in the woods
I wasnt in a sanguinary mood
They walked on with the same light gait so nearly of a height that keeping step came as naturally to them as breathing
Anna stole another look at the young face on a level with her own
You DID say there was something you wanted to tell me her stepson began after a pause
Well there is
She slackened her pace involuntarily and they came to a pause and stood facing each other under the limes
Is Darrow coming
he asked
She seldom blushed but at the question a sudden heat suffused her
She held her head high
Yes hes coming
Ive just heard
He arrives tomorrow
But thats not She saw her blunder and tried to rectify it
Or rather yes in a way it is my reason for wanting to speak to you Because hes coming
Because hes not yet here
Its about him then
He looked at her kindly halfhumourously an almost fraternal wisdom in his smile
About
No no I meant that I wanted to speak today because its our last day alone together
Oh I see
He had slipped his hands into the pockets of his tweed shooting jacket and lounged along at her side his eyes bent on the moist ruts of the drive as though the matter had lost all interest for him
Owen He stopped again and faced her
Look here my dear its no sort of use
Whats no use
Anything on earth you can any of you say
She challenged him Am I one of any of you
He did not yield
Well thenanything on earth that even YOU can say
You dont in the least know what I can sayor what I mean to
Dont I generally
She gave him this point but only to make another
Yes but this is particularly
I want to sayOwen youve been admirable all through
He broke into a laugh in which the odd elderbrotherly note was once more perceptible
Admirable she emphasized
And so has SHE
Oh and so have you to HER
His voice broke down to boyishness
Ive never lost sight of that for a minute
Its been altogether easier for her though he threw off presently
On the whole I suppose it has
Well she summed up with a laugh arent you all the better pleased to be told youve behaved as well as she
Oh you know Ive not done it for you he tossed back at her without the least note of hostility in the affected lightness of his tone
Havent you though perhapsthe least bit
Because after all you knew I understood
Youve been awfully kind about pretending to
She laughed
You dont believe me
You must remember I had your grandmother to consider
Yes and my fatherand Effie I supposeand the outraged shades of Givre
He paused as if to lay more stress on the boyish sneer Do you likewise include the late Monsieur de Chantelle
His stepmother did not appear to resent the thrust
She went on in the same tone of affectionate persuasion Yes I must have seemed to you too subject to Givre
Perhaps I have been
But you know that was not my real object in asking you to wait to say nothing to your grandmother before her return
He considered
Your real object of course was to gain time
Yesbut for whom
Why not for YOU
For me
He flushed up quickly
You dont mean
She laid her hand on his arm and looked gravely into his handsome eyes
I mean that when your grandmother gets back from Ouchy I shall speak to her Youll speak to her
Yes if only youll promise to give me time Time for her to send for Adelaide Painter
Oh shell undoubtedly send for Adelaide Painter
The allusion touched a spring of mirth in both their minds and they exchanged a laughing look
Only you must promise not to rush things
You must give me time to prepare Adelaide too Mrs Leath went on
Prepare her too
He drew away for a better look at her
Prepare her for what
Why to prepare your grandmother
For your marriage
Yes thats what I mean
Im going to see you through you know  His feint of indifference broke down and he caught her hand
Oh you dear divine thing
I didnt dream I know you didnt
She dropped her gaze and began to walk on slowly
I cant say youve convinced me of the wisdom of the step
Only I seem to see that other things matter moreand that not missing things matters most
Perhaps Ive changedor YOUR not changing has convinced me
Im certain now that you wont budge
And that was really all I ever cared about
Oh as to not budgingI told you so months ago you might have been sure of that
And how can you be any surer today than yesterday
I dont know
I suppose one learns something every day  Not at Givre
he laughed and shot a halfironic look at her
But you havent really BEEN at Givre latelynot for months
Dont you suppose Ive noticed that my dear
She echoed his laugh to merge it in an undenying sigh
Poor Givre Poor empty Givre
With so many rooms full and yet not a soul in itexcept of course my grandmother who is its soul
They had reached the gateway of the court and stood looking with a common accord at the long softhued facade on which the autumn light was dying
It looks so made to be happy in she murmured
Yestoday today
He pressed her arm a little
Oh you darlingto have given it that look for me
He paused and then went on in a lower voice Dont you feel we owe it to the poor old place to do what we can to give it that look
You too I mean
Come lets make it grin from wing to wing
Ive such a mad desire to say outrageous things to it havent you
After all in old times there must have been living people here
Loosening her arm from his she continued to gaze up at the housefront which seemed in the plaintive decline of light to send her back the mute appeal of something doomed
It IS beautiful she said
A beautiful memory
Quite perfect to take out and turn over when Im grinding at the law in New York and youre He broke off and looked at her with a questioning smile
Come
Tell me
You and I dont have to say things to talk to each other
When you turn suddenly absentminded and mysterious I always feel like saying Come back
All is discovered
She returned his smile
You know as much as I know
I promise you that
He wavered as if for the first time uncertain how far he might go
I dont know Darrow as much as you know him he presently risked
She frowned a little
You said just now we didnt need to say things Was I speaking
I thought it was your eyes He caught her by both elbows and spun her halfway round so that the late sun shed a betraying gleam on her face
Theyre such awfully conversational eyes
Dont you suppose they told me long ago why its just today youve made up your mind that people have got to live their own liveseven at Givre
XI This is the south terrace Anna said
Should you like to walk down to the river
She seemed to listen to herself speaking from a faroff airy height and yet to be wholly gathered into the circle of consciousness which drew its glowing ring about herself and Darrow
To the aerial listener her words sounded flat and colourless but to the self within the ring each one beat with a separate heart
It was the day after Darrows arrival and he had come down early drawn by the sweetness of the light on the lawns and gardens below his window
Anna had heard the echo of his step on the stairs his pause in the stone flagged hall his voice as he asked a servant where to find her
She was at the end of the house in the brownpanelled sittingroom which she frequented at that season because it caught the sunlight first and kept it longest
She stood near the window in the pale band of brightness arranging some salmonpink geraniums in a shallow porcelain bowl
Every sensation of touch and sight was thricealive in her
The grey green fur of the geranium leaves caressed her fingers and the sunlight wavering across the irregular surface of the old parquet floor made it seem as bright and shifting as the brown bed of a stream
Darrow stood framed in the doorway of the farthest drawing room a lightgrey figure against the black and white flagging of the hall then he began to move toward her down the empty palepanelled vista crossing one after another the long reflections which a projecting cabinet or screen cast here and there upon the shining floors
As he drew nearer his figure was suddenly displaced by that of her husband whom from the same point she had so often seen advancing down the same perspective
Straight spare erect looking to right and left with quick precise turns of the head and stopping now and then to straighten a chair or alter the position of a vase Fraser Leath used to march toward her through the double file of furniture like a general reviewing a regiment drawn up for his inspection
At a certain point midway across the second room he always stopped before the mantelpiece of pinkishyellow marble and looked at himself in the tall garlanded glass that surmounted it
She could not remember that he had ever found anything to straighten or alter in his own studied attire but she had never known him to omit the inspection when he passed that particular mirror
When it was over he continued more briskly on his way and the resulting expression of satisfaction was still on his face when he entered the oak sittingroom to greet his wife
The spectral projection of this little daily scene hung but for a moment before Anna but in that moment she had time to fling a wondering glance across the distance between her past and present
Then the footsteps of the present came close and she had to drop the geraniums to give her hand to Darrow Yes let us walk down to the river
They had neither of them as yet found much to say to each other
Darrow had arrived late on the previous afternoon and during the evening they had had between them Owen Leath and their own thoughts
Now they were alone for the first time and the fact was enough in itself
Yet Anna was intensely aware that as soon as they began to talk more intimately they would feel that they knew each other less well
They passed out onto the terrace and down the steps to the gravel walk below
The delicate frosting of dew gave the grass a bluish shimmer and the sunlight sliding in emerald streaks along the treeboles gathered itself into great luminous blurs at the end of the woodwalks and hung above the fields a watery glory like the ring about an autumn moon
Its good to be here Darrow said
They took a turn to the left and stopped for a moment to look back at the long pink housefront plainer friendlier less adorned than on the side toward the court
So prolonged yet delicate had been the friction of time upon its bricks that certain expanses had the bloom and texture of old red velvet and the patches of gold lichen spreading over them looked like the last traces of a dim embroidery
The dome of the chapel with its gilded cross rose above one wing and the other ended in a conical pigeonhouse above which the birds were flying lustrous and slatey their breasts merged in the blue of the roof when they dropped down on it
And this is where youve been all these years
They turned away and began to walk down a long tunnel of yellowing trees
Benches with mossy feet stood against the mossy edges of the path and at its farther end it widened into a circle about a basin rimmed with stone in which the opaque water strewn with leaves looked like a slab of gold flecked agate
The path growing narrower wound on circuitously through the woods between slender serried trunks twined with ivy
Patches of blue appeared above them through the dwindling leaves and presently the trees drew back and showed the open fields along the river
They walked on across the fields to the towpath
In a curve of the wall some steps led up to a crumbling pavilion with openings choked with ivy
Anna and Darrow seated themselves on the bench projecting from the inner wall of the pavilion and looked across the river at the slopes divided into blocks of green and fawncolour and at the chalktinted village lifting its squat churchtower and grey roofs against the precisely drawn lines of the landscape
Anna sat silent so intensely aware of Darrows nearness that there was no surprise in the touch he laid on her hand
They looked at each other and he smiled and said There are to be no more obstacles now
Obstacles
The word startled her
What obstacles
Dont you remember the wording of the telegram that turned me back last May
Unforeseen obstacle that was it
What was the earthshaking problem by the way
Finding a governess for Effie wasnt it
But I gave you my reason the reason why it was an obstacle
I wrote you fully about it
Yes I know you did
He lifted her hand and kissed it
How far off it all seems and how little it all matters today
She looked at him quickly
Do you feel that
I suppose Im different
I want to draw all those wasted months into todayto make them a part of it
But they are to me
You reach back and take everything back to the first days of all
She frowned a little as if struggling with an inarticulate perplexity
Its curious how in those first days too something that I didnt understand came between us
Oh in those days we neither of us understood did we
Its part of whats called the bliss of being young
Yes I thought that too thought it I mean in looking back
But it couldnt even then have been as true of you as of me and now Now he said the only thing that matters is that were sitting here together
He dismissed the rest with a lightness that might have seemed conclusive evidence of her power over him
But she took no pride in such triumphs
It seemed to her that she wanted his allegiance and his adoration not so much for herself as for their mutual love and that in treating lightly any past phase of their relation he took something from its present beauty
The colour rose to her face
Between you and me everything matters
Of course
She felt the unperceiving sweetness of his smile
Thats why he went on everything for me is here and now on this bench between you and me
She caught at the phrase
Thats what I meant its here and now we cant get away from it
Get away from it
Do you want to
AGAIN
Her heart was beating unsteadily
Something in her fitfully and with reluctance struggled to free itself but the warmth of his nearness penetrated every sense as the sunlight steeped the landscape
Then suddenly she felt that she wanted no less than the whole of her happiness
Again
But wasnt it YOU the last time
She paused the tremor in her of Psyche holding up the lamp
But in the interrogative light of her pause her companions features underwent no change
The last time
Last spring
But it was you whofor the best of reasons as youve told meturned me back from your very door last spring
She saw that he was goodhumouredly ready to thresh out for her sentimental satisfaction a question which for his own Time had so conclusively dealt with and the sense of his readiness reassured her
I wrote as soon as I could she rejoined
I explained the delay and asked you to come
And you never even answered my letter
It was impossible to come then
I had to go back to my post
And impossible to write and tell me so
Your letter was a long time coming
I had waited a week ten days
I had some excuse for thinking when it came that you were in no great hurry for an answer
You thought thatreallyafter reading it
I thought it
Her heart leaped up to her throat
Then why are you here today
He turned on her with a quick look of wonder
God knows if you can ask me that
You see I was right to say I didnt understand
He stood up abruptly and stood facing her blocking the view over the river and the checkered slopes
Perhaps I might say so too
No no we must neither of us have any reason for saying it again
She looked at him gravely
Surely you and I neednt arrange the lights before we show ourselves to each other
I want you to see me just as I am with all my irrational doubts and scruples the old ones and the new ones too
He came back to his seat beside her
Never mind the old ones
They were justifiedIm willing to admit it
With the governess having suddenly to be packed off and Effie on your hands and your motherinlaw ill I see the impossibility of your letting me come
I even see that at the moment it was difficult to write and explain
But what does all that matter now
The new scruples are the ones I want to tackle
Again her heart trembled
She felt her happiness so near so sure that to strain it closer might be like a childs crushing a pet bird in its caress
But her very security urged her on
For so long her doubts had been knifeedged now they had turned into bright harmless toys that she could toss and catch without peril
You didnt come and you didnt answer my letter and after waiting four months I wrote another
And I answered that one and Im here
Yes
She held his eyes
But in my last letter I repeated exactly what Id said in the firstthe one I wrote you last June
I told you then that I was ready to give you the answer to what youd asked me in London and in telling you that I told you what the answer was
My dearest
My dearest
Darrow murmured
You ignored that letter
All summer you made no sign
And all I ask now is that you should frankly tell me why
I can only repeat what Ive just said
I was hurt and unhappy and I doubted you
I suppose if Id cared less I should have been more confident
I cared so much that I couldnt risk another failure
For youd made me feel that Id miserably failed
So I shut my eyes and set my teeth and turned my back
Theres the whole pusillanimous truth of it
Oh if its the WHOLE truth She let him clasp her
Theres my torment you see
I thought that was what your silence meant till I made you break it
Now I want to be sure that I was right
What can I tell you to make you sure
You can let me tell YOU everything first
She drew away but without taking her hands from him
Owen saw you in Paris she began
She looked at him and he faced her steadily
The light was full on his pleasantlybrowned face his grey eyes his frank white forehead
She noticed for the first time a sealring in a setting of twisted silver on the hand he had kept on hers
In Paris
Oh yesSo he did
He came back and told me
I think you talked to him a moment in a theatre
I asked if youd spoken of my having put you offor if youd sent me any message
He didnt remember that you had
In a crushin a Paris foyer
My dear
It was absurd of me
But Owen and I have always been on odd kind of brotherandsister terms
I think he guessed about us when he saw you with me in London
So he teased me a little and tried to make me curious about you and when he saw hed succeeded he told me he hadnt had time to say much to you because you were in such a hurry to get back to the lady you were with
He still held her hands but she felt no tremor in his and the blood did not stir in his brown cheek
He seemed to be honestly turning over his memories
Yes and what else did he tell you
Oh not much except that she was awfully pretty
When I asked him to describe her he said you had her tucked away in a baignoire and he hadnt actually seen her but he saw the tail of her cloak and somehow knew from that that she was pretty
One DOES you knowI think he said the cloak was pink
Darrow broke into a laugh
Of course it wasthey always are
So that was at the bottom of your doubts
Not at first
I only laughed
But afterward when I wrote you and you didnt answerOh you DO see
she appealed to him
He was looking at her gently
Yes I see
Its not as if this were a light thing between us
I want you to know me as I am
If I thought that at that momentwhen you were on your way here almost He dropped her hand and stood up
Yes yesI understand
But do you
Her look followed him
Im not a goose of a girl
I knowof course I KNOWbut there are things a woman feelswhen what she knows doesnt make any difference
Its not that I want you to explainI mean about that particular evening
Its only that I want you to have the whole of my feeling
I didnt know what it was till I saw you again
I never dreamed I should say such things to you
I never dreamed I should be here to hear you say them
He turned back and lifting a floating end of her scarf put his lips to it
But now that you have I knowI know he smiled down at her
You know
That this is no light thing between us
Now you may ask me anything you please
That was all I wanted to ask YOU
For a long moment they looked at each other without speaking
She saw the dancing spirit in his eyes turn grave and darken to a passionate sternness
He stooped and kissed her and she sat as if folded in wings
XII It was in the natural order of things that on the way back to the house their talk should have turned to the future
Anna was not eager to define it
She had an extraordinary sensitiveness to the impalpable elements of happiness and as she walked at Darrows side her imagination flew back and forth spinning luminous webs of feeling between herself and the scene about her
Every heightening of emotion produced for her a new effusion of beauty in visible things and with it the sense that such moments should be lingered over and absorbed like some unrenewable miracle
She understood Darrows impatience to see their plans take shape
She knew it must be so she would not have had it otherwise but to reach a point where she could fix her mind on his appeal for dates and decisions was like trying to break her way through the silver tangle of an April wood
Darrow wished to use his diplomatic opportunities as a means of studying certain economic and social problems with which he presently hoped to deal in print and with this in view he had asked for and obtained a South American appointment
Anna was ready to follow where he led and not reluctant to put new sights as well as new thoughts between herself and her past
She had in a direct way only Effie and Effies education to consider and there seemed after due reflection no reason why the most anxious regard for these should not be conciliated with the demands of Darrows career
Effie it was evident could be left to Madame de Chantelles care till the couple should have organized their life and she might even as long as her future step fathers work retained him in distant posts continue to divide her year between Givre and the antipodes
As for Owen who had reached his legal majority two years before and was soon to attain the age fixed for the taking over of his paternal inheritance the arrival of this date would reduce his stepmothers responsibility to a friendly concern for his welfare
This made for the prompt realization of Darrows wishes and there seemed no reason why the marriage should not take place within the six weeks that remained of his leave
They passed out of the woodwalk into the open brightness of the garden
The noon sunlight sheeted with gold the bronze flanks of the polygonal yews
Chrysanthemums russet saffron and orange glowed like the efflorescence of an enchanted forest belts of red begonia purpling to wine colour ran like smouldering flame among the borders and above this outspread tapestry the house extended its harmonious length the soberness of its lines softened to grace in the luminous misty air
Darrow stood still and Anna felt that his glance was travelling from her to the scene about them and then back to her face
Youre sure youre prepared to give up Givre
You look so made for each other
Oh Givre She broke off suddenly feeling as if her too careless tone had delivered all her past into his hands and with one of her instinctive movements of recoil she added When Owen marries I shall have to give it up
When Owen marries
Thats looking some distance ahead
I want to be told that meanwhile youll have no regrets
She hesitated
Why did he press her to uncover to him her poor starved past
A vague feeling of loyalty a desire to spare what could no longer harm her made her answer evasively There will probably be no meanwhile
Owen may marry before long
She had not meant to touch on the subject for her stepson had sworn her to provisional secrecy but since the shortness of Darrows leave necessitated a prompt adjustment of their own plans it was after all inevitable that she should give him at least a hint of Owens
Owen marry
Why he always seems like a faun in flannels
I hope hes found a dryad
There might easily be one left in these blueandgold woods
I cant tell you yet where he found his dryad but she IS one I believe at any rate shell become the Givre woods better than I do
Only there may be difficulties Well
At that age theyre not always to be wished away
She hesitated
Owen at any rate has made up his mind to overcome them and Ive promised to see him through
She went on after a moments consideration to explain that her stepsons choice was for various reasons not likely to commend itself to his grandmother
She must be prepared for it and Ive promised to do the preparing
You know I always HAVE seen him through things and he rather counts on me now
She fancied that Darrows exclamation had in it a faint note of annoyance and wondered if he again suspected her of seeking a pretext for postponement
But once Owens future is settled you wont surely for the sake of what you call seeing him through ask that I should go away again without you
He drew her closer as they walked
Owen will understand if you dont
Since hes in the same case himself Ill throw myself on his mercy
Hell see that I have the first claim on you he wont even want you not to see it
Owen sees everything Im not afraid of that
But his future isnt settled
Hes very young to marrytoo young his grandmother is sure to thinkand the marriage he wants to make is not likely to convince her to the contrary
You dont mean that its like his first choice
Oh no
But its not what Madame de Chantelle would call a good match its not even what I call a wise one
Yet youre backing him up
Yet Im backing him up
She paused
I wonder if youll understand
What Ive most wanted for him and shall want for Effie is that they shall always feel free to make their own mistakes and never if possible be persuaded to make other peoples
Even if Owens marriage is a mistake and has to be paid for I believe hell learn and grow in the paying
Of course I cant make Madame de Chantelle see this but I can remind her that with his characterhis big rushes of impulse his odd intervals of ebb and apathyshe may drive him into some worse blunder if she thwarts him now
And you mean to break the news to her as soon as she comes back from Ouchy
As soon as I see my way to it
She knows the girl and likes her thats our hope
And yet it may in the end prove our danger make it harder for us all when she learns the truth than if Owen had chosen a stranger
I cant tell you more till Ive told her Ive promised Owen not to tell any one
All I ask you is to give me time to give me a few days at any rate Shes been wonderfully nice as she would call it about you and about the fact of my having soon to leave Givre but that again may make it harder for Owen
At any rate you can see cant you how it makes me want to stand by him
You see I couldnt bear it if the least fraction of my happiness seemed to be stolen from hisas if it were a little scrap of happiness that had to be pieced out with other peoples
She clasped her hands on Darrows arm
I want our life to be like a house with all the windows lit Id like to string lanterns from the roof and chimneys
She ended with an inward tremor
All through her exposition and her appeal she had told herself that the moment could hardly have been less well chosen
In Darrows place she would have felt as he doubtless did that her carefully developed argument was only the disguise of an habitual indecision
It was the hour of all others when she would have liked to affirm herself by brushing aside every obstacle to his wishes yet it was only by opposing them that she could show the strength of character she wanted him to feel in her
But as she talked she began to see that Darrows face gave back no reflection of her words that he continued to wear the abstracted look of a man who is not listening to what is said to him
It caused her a slight pang to discover that his thoughts could wander at such a moment then with a flush of joy she perceived the reason
In some undefinable way she had become aware without turning her head that he was steeped in the sense of her nearness absorbed in contemplating the details of her face and dress and the discovery made the words throng to her lips
She felt herself speak with ease authority conviction
She said to herself He doesnt care what I sayits enough that I say iteven if its stupid hell like me better for it She knew that every inflexion of her voice every gesture every characteristic of her personits very defects the fact that her forehead was too high that her eyes were not large enough that her hands though slender were not small and that the fingers did not tapershe knew that these deficiencies were so many channels through which her influence streamed to him that she pleased him in spite of them perhaps because of them that he wanted her as she was and not as she would have liked to be and for the first time she felt in her veins the security and lightness of happy love
They reached the court and walked under the limes toward the house
The hall door stood wide and through the windows opening on the terrace the sun slanted across the black and white floor the faded tapestry chairs and Darrows travelling coat and cap which lay among the cloaks and rugs piled on a bench against the wall
The sight of these garments lying among her own wraps gave her a sense of homely intimacy
It was as if her happiness came down from the skies and took on the plain dress of daily things
At last she seemed to hold it in her hand
As they entered the hall her eye lit on an unstamped note conspicuously placed on the table
From Owen
He must have rushed off somewhere in the motor
She felt a secret stir of pleasure at the immediate inference that she and Darrow would probably lunch alone
Then she opened the note and stared at it in wonder
Dear Owen wrote after what you said yesterday I cant wait another hour and Im off to Francheuil to catch the Dijon express and travel back with them
Dont be frightened I wont speak unless its safe to
Trust me for thatbut I had to go
She looked up slowly
Hes gone to Dijon to meet his grandmother
Oh I hope I havent made a mistake
You
Why what have you to do with his going to Dijon
She hesitated
The day before yesterday I told him for the first time that I meant to see him through no matter what happened
And Im afraid hes lost his head and will be imprudent and spoil things
You see I hadnt meant to say a word to him till Id had time to prepare Madame de Chantelle
She felt that Darrow was looking at her and reading her thoughts and the colour flew to her face
Yes it was when I heard you were coming that I told him
I wanted him to feel as I feltit seemed too unkind to make him wait
Her hand was in his and his arm rested for a moment on her shoulder
It WOULD have been too unkind to make him wait
They moved side by side toward the stairs
Through the haze of bliss enveloping her Owens affairs seemed curiously unimportant and remote
Nothing really mattered but this torrent of light in her veins
She put her foot on the lowest step saying Its nearly luncheon timeI must take off my hat and as she started up the stairs Darrow stood below in the hall and watched her
But the distance between them did not make him seem less near it was as if his thoughts moved with her and touched her like endearing hands
In her bedroom she shut the door and stood still looking about her in a fit of dreamy wonder
Her feelings were unlike any she had ever known richer deeper more complete
For the first time everything in her from head to foot seemed to be feeding the same full current of sensation
She took off her hat and went to the dressingtable to smooth her hair
The pressure of the hat had flattened the dark strands on her forehead her face was paler than usual with shadows about the eyes
She felt a pang of regret for the wasted years
If I look like this today she said to herself what will he think of me when Im ill or worried
She began to run her fingers through her hair rejoicing in its thickness then she desisted and sat still resting her chin on her hands
I want him to see me as I am she thought
Deeper than the deepest fibre of her vanity was the triumphant sense that AS SHE WAS with her flattened hair her tired pallor her thin sleeves a little tumbled by the weight of her jacket he would like her even better feel her nearer dearer more desirable than in all the splendours she might put on for him
In the light of this discovery she studied her face with a new intentness seeing its defects as she had never seen them yet seeing them through a kind of radiance as though love were a luminous medium into which she had been bodily plunged
She was glad now that she had confessed her doubts and her jealousy
She divined that a man in love may be flattered by such involuntary betrayals that there are moments when respect for his liberty appeals to him less than the inability to respect it moments so propitious that a womans very mistakes and indiscretions may help to establish her dominion
The sense of power she had been aware of in talking to Darrow came back with tenfold force
She felt like testing him by the most fantastic exactions and at the same moment she longed to humble herself before him to make herself the shadow and echo of his mood
She wanted to linger with him in a world of fancy and yet to walk at his side in the world of fact
She wanted him to feel her power and yet to love her for her ignorance and humility
She felt like a slave and a goddess and a girl in her teens XIII Darrow late that evening threw himself into an armchair before his fire and mused
The room was propitious to meditation
The redveiled lamp the corners of shadow the splashes of firelight on the curves of old fullbodied wardrobes and cabinets gave it an air of intimacy increased by its faded hangings its slightly frayed and threadbare rugs
Everything in it was harmoniously shabby with a subtle soughtfor shabbiness in which Darrow fancied he discerned the touch of Fraser Leath
But Fraser Leath had grown so unimportant a factor in the scheme of things that these marks of his presence caused the young man no emotion beyond that of a faint retrospective amusement
The afternoon and evening had been perfect
After a moment of concern over her stepsons departure Anna had surrendered herself to her happiness with an impetuosity that Darrow had never suspected in her
Early in the afternoon they had gone out in the motor traversing miles of sobertinted landscape in which here and there a scarlet vineyard flamed clattering through the streets of stony villages coming out on low slopes above the river or winding through the pale gold of narrow woodroads with the blue of clearcut hills at their end
Over everything lay a faint sunshine that seemed dissolved in the still air and the smell of wet roots and decaying leaves was merged in the pungent scent of burning underbrush
Once at the turn of a wall they stopped the motor before a ruined gateway and stumbling along a road full of ruts stood before a little old deserted house fantastically carved and chimneyed which lay in a moat under the shade of ancient trees
They paced the paths between the trees found a mouldy Temple of Love on an islet among reeds and plantains and sitting on a bench in the stableyard watched the pigeons circling against the sunset over their cot of patterned brick
Then the motor flew on into the dusk
When they came in they sat beside the fire in the oak drawingroom and Darrow noticed how delicately her head stood out against the sombre panelling and mused on the enjoyment there would always be in the mere fact of watching her hands as they moved about among the teathings
They dined late and facing her across the table with its low lights and flowers he felt an extraordinary pleasure in seeing her again in evening dress and in letting his eyes dwell on the proud shy set of her head the way her dark hair clasped it and the girlish thinness of her neck above the slight swell of the breast
His imagination was struck by the quality of reticence in her beauty
She suggested a fine portrait kept down to a few tones or a Greek vase on which the play of light is the only pattern
After dinner they went out on the terrace for a look at the moonmisted park
Through the crepuscular whiteness the trees hung in blotted masses
Below the terrace the garden drew its dark diagrams between statues that stood like muffled conspirators on the edge of the shadow
Farther off the meadows unrolled a silvershot tissue to the mantling of mist above the river and the autumn stars trembled overhead like their own reflections seen in dim water
He lit his cigar and they walked slowly up and down the flags in the languid air till he put an arm about her saying You mustnt stay till youre chilled then they went back into the room and drew up their chairs to the fire
It seemed only a moment later that she said It must be after eleven and stood up and looked down on him smiling faintly
He sat still absorbing the look and thinking Therell be evenings and eveningstill she came nearer bent over him and with a hand on his shoulder said Good night
He got to his feet and put his arms about her
Good night he answered and held her fast and they gave each other a long kiss of promise and communion
The memory of it glowed in him still as he sat over his crumbling fire but beneath his physical exultation he felt a certain gravity of mood
His happiness was in some sort the rallyingpoint of many scattered purposes
He summed it up vaguely by saying to himself that to be loved by a woman like that made all the differenceHe was a little tired of experimenting on life he wanted to take a line to follow things up to centralize and concentrate and produce results
Two or three more years of diplomacywith her beside himand then their real life would begin study travel and bookmaking for him and for herwell the joy at any rate of getting out of an atmosphere of bricabrac and cardleaving into the open air of competing activities
The desire for change had for some time been latent in him and his meeting with Mrs Leath the previous spring had given it a definite direction
With such a comrade to focus and stimulate his energies he felt modestly but agreeably sure of doing something
And under this assurance was the lurking sense that he was somehow worthy of his opportunity
His life on the whole had been a creditable affair
Out of modest chances and middling talents he had built himself a fairly marked personality known some exceptional people done a number of interesting and a few rather difficult things and found himself at thirtyseven possessed of an intellectual ambition sufficient to occupy the passage to a robust and energetic old age
As for the private and personal side of his life it had come up to the current standards and if it had dropped now and then below a more ideal measure even these declines had been brief parenthetic incidental
In the recognized essentials he had always remained strictly within the limit of his scruples
From this reassuring survey of his case he came back to the contemplation of its crowning felicity
His mind turned again to his first meeting with Anna Summers and took up one by one the threads of their faintly sketched romance
He dwelt with pardonable pride on the fact that fate had so early marked him for the high privilege of possessing her it seemed to mean that they had really in the truest sense of the illused phrase been made for each other
Deeper still than all these satisfactions was the mere elemental sense of wellbeing in her presence
That after all was what proved her to be the woman for him the pleasure he took in the set of her head the way her hair grew on her forehead and at the nape her steady gaze when he spoke the grave freedom of her gait and gestures
He recalled every detail of her face the fine veinings of the temples the bluishbrown shadows in her upper lids and the way the reflections of two stars seemed to form and break up in her eyes when he held her close to him
If he had had any doubt as to the nature of her feeling for him those dissolving stars would have allayed it
She was reserved she was shy even was what the shallow and effusive would call cold
She was like a picture so hung that it can be seen only at a certain angle an angle known to no one but its possessor
The thought flattered his sense of possessorshipHe felt that the smile on his lips would have been fatuous had it had a witness
He was thinking of her look when she had questioned him about his meeting with Owen at the theatre less of her words than of her look and of the effort the question cost her the reddening of her cheek the deepening of the strained line between her brows the way her eyes sought shelter and then turned and drew on him
Pride and passion were in the conflictmagnificent qualities in a wife
The sight almost made up for his momentary embarrassment at the rousing of a memory which had no place in his present picture of himself
Yes
It was worth a good deal to watch that fight between her instinct and her intelligence and know ones self the object of the struggle Mingled with these sensations were considerations of another order
He reflected with satisfaction that she was the kind of woman with whom one would like to be seen in public
It would be distinctly agreeable to follow her into drawing rooms to walk after her down the aisle of a theatre to get in and out of trains with her to say my wife of her to all sorts of people
He draped these details in the handsome phrase Shes a woman to be proud of and felt that this fact somehow justified and ennobled his instinctive boyish satisfaction in loving her
He stood up rambled across the room and leaned out for a while into the starry night
Then he dropped again into his armchair with a sigh of deep content
Oh hang it he suddenly exclaimed its the best thing thats ever happened to me anyhow
The next day was even better
He felt and knew she felt that they had reached a clearer understanding of each other
It was as if after a swim through bright opposing waves with a dazzle of sun in their eyes they had gained an inlet in the shades of a cliff where they could float on the still surface and gaze far down into the depths
Now and then as they walked and talked he felt a thrill of youthful wonder at the coincidence of their views and their experiences at the way their minds leapt to the same point in the same instant
The old delusion I suppose he smiled to himself
Will Nature never tire of the trick
But he knew it was more than that
There were moments in their talk when he felt distinctly and unmistakably the solid ground of friendship underneath the whirling dance of his sensations
How I should like her if I didnt love her
he summed it up wondering at the miracle of such a union
In the course of the morning a telegram had come from Owen Leath announcing that he his grandmother and Effie would arrive from Dijon that afternoon at four
The station of the main line was eight or ten miles from Givre and Anna soon after three left in the motor to meet the travellers
When she had gone Darrow started for a walk planning to get back late in order that the reunited family might have the end of the afternoon to themselves
He roamed the country side till long after dark and the stableclock of Givre was striking seven as he walked up the avenue to the court
In the hall coming down the stairs he encountered Anna
Her face was serene and his first glance showed him that Owen had kept his word and that none of her forebodings had been fulfilled
She had just come down from the schoolroom where Effie and the governess were having supper the little girl she told him looked immensely better for her Swiss holiday but was dropping with sleep after the journey and too tired to make her habitual appearance in the drawingroom before being put to bed
Madame de Chantelle was resting but would be down for dinner and as for Owen Anna supposed he was off somewhere in the parkhe had a passion for prowling about the park at nightfall Darrow followed her into the brown room where the teatable had been left for him
He declined her offer of tea but she lingered a moment to tell him that Owen had in fact kept his word and that Madame de Chantelle had come back in the best of humours and unsuspicious of the blow about to fall
She has enjoyed her month at Ouchy and it has given her a lot to talk abouther symptoms and the rival doctors and the people at the hotel
It seems she met your Ambassadress there and Lady Wantley and some other London friends of yours and shes heard what she calls delightful things about you she told me to tell you so
She attaches great importance to the fact that your grandmother was an Everard of Albany
Shes prepared to open her arms to you
I dont know whether it wont make it harder for poor Owenthe contrast I meanThere are no Ambassadresses or Everards to vouch for HIS choice
But youll help me wont you
Youll help me to help him
Tomorrow Ill tell you the rest
Now I must rush up and tuck in Effie Oh youll see well pull it off for him
he assured her together we cant fail to pull it off
He stood and watched her with a smile as she fled down the halflit vista to the hall
XIV If Darrow on entering the drawingroom before dinner examined its new occupant with unusual interest it was more on Owen Leaths account than his own
Annas hints had roused his interest in the lads love affair and he wondered what manner of girl the heroine of the coming conflict might be
He had guessed that Owens rebellion symbolized for his stepmother her own long struggle against the Leath conventions and he understood that if Anna so passionately abetted him it was partly because as she owned she wanted his liberation to coincide with hers
The lady who was to represent in the impending struggle the forces of order and tradition was seated by the fire when Darrow entered
Among the flowers and old furniture of the large palepanelled room Madame de Chantelle had the inanimate elegance of a figure introduced into a still life to give the scale
And this Darrow reflected was exactly what she doubtless regarded as her chief obligation he was sure she thought a great deal of measure and approved of most things only up to a certain point
She was a woman of sixty with a figure at once young and oldfashioned
Her fair faded tints her quaint corseting the passementerie on her tightwaisted dress the velvet band on her tapering arm made her resemble a carte de visite photograph of the middle sixties
One saw her younger but no less invincibly ladylike leaning on a chair with a fringed back a curl in her neck a locket on her tuckered bosom toward the end of an embossed morocco album beginning with The Beauties of the Second Empire
She received her daughterinlaws suitor with an affability which implied her knowledge and approval of his suit
Darrow had already guessed her to be a person who would instinctively oppose any suggested changes and then after one had exhausted ones main arguments unexpectedly yield to some small incidental reason and adhere doggedly to her new position
She boasted of her oldfashioned prejudices talked a good deal of being a grandmother and made a show of reaching up to tap Owens shoulder though his height was little more than hers
She was full of a small pale prattle about the people she had seen at Ouchy as to whom she had the minute statistical information of a gazetteer without any apparent sense of personal differences
She said to Darrow They tell me things are very much changed in AmericaOf course in my youth there WAS a SocietyShe had no desire to return there she was sure the standards must be so different
There are charming people everywhereand one must always look on the best sidebut when one has lived among Traditions its difficult to adapt ones self to the new ideasThese dreadful views of marriageits so hard to explain them to my French relationsIm thankful to say I dont pretend to understand them myself
But YOURE an EverardI told Anna last spring in London that one sees that instantly She wandered off to the cooking and the service of the hotel at Ouchy
She attached great importance to gastronomic details and to the manners of hotel servants
There too there was a falling off she said
I don t know of course but people say its owing to the Americans
Certainly my waiter had a way of slapping down the dishesthey tell me that many of them are Anarchistsbelong to Unions you know
She appealed to Darrows reported knowledge of economic conditions to confirm this ominous rumour
After dinner Owen Leath wandered into the next room where the piano stood and began to play among the shadows
His stepmother presently joined him and Darrow sat alone with Madame de Chantelle
She took up the thread of her mild chat and carried it on at the same pace as her knitting
Her conversation resembled the large loosestranded web between her fingers now and then she dropped a stitch and went on regardless of the gap in the pattern
Darrow listened with a lazy sense of wellbeing
In the mental lull of the afterdinner hour with harmonious memories murmuring through his mind and the soft tints and shadowy spaces of the fine old room charming his eyes to indolence Madame de Chantelles discourse seemed not out of place
He could understand that in the long run the atmosphere of Givre might be suffocating but in his present mood its very limitations had a grace
Presently he found the chance to say a word in his own behalf and thereupon measured the advantage never before particularly apparent to him of being related to the Everards of Albany
Madame de Chantelles conception of her native countryto which she had not returned since her twentieth yearreminded him of an ancient geographers map of the Hyperborean regions
It was all a foggy blank from which only one or two fixed outlines emerged and one of these belonged to the Everards of Albany
The fact that they offered such firm footingformed so to speak a friendly territory on which the opposing powers could meet and treathelped him through the task of explaining and justifying himself as the successor of Fraser Leath
Madame de Chantelle could not resist such incontestable claims
She seemed to feel her sons hovering and discriminating presence and she gave Darrow the sense that he was being tested and approved as a last addition to the Leath Collection
She also made him aware of the immense advantage he possessed in belonging to the diplomatic profession
She spoke of this humdrum calling as a Career and gave Darrow to understand that she supposed him to have been seducing Duchesses when he was not negotiating Treaties
He heard again quaint phrases which romantic old ladies had used in his youth Brilliant diplomatic societysocial advantagesthe entree everywherenothing else FORMS a young man in the same way and she sighingly added that she could have wished her grandson had chosen the same path to glory
Darrow prudently suppressed his own view of the profession as well as the fact that he had adopted it provisionally and for reasons less social than sociological and the talk presently passed on to the subject of his future plans
Here again Madame de Chantelles awe of the Career made her admit the necessity of Annas consenting to an early marriage
The fact that Darrow was ordered to South America seemed to put him in the romantic light of a young soldier charged to lead a forlorn hope she sighed and said At such moments a wifes duty is at her husbands side
The problem of Effies future might have disturbed her she added but since Anna for a time consented to leave the little girl with her that problem was at any rate deferred
She spoke plaintively of the responsibility of looking after her granddaughter but Darrow divined that she enjoyed the flavour of the word more than she felt the weight of the fact
Effies a perfect child
Shes more like my son perhaps than dear Owen
Shell never intentionally give me the least trouble
But of course the responsibility will be greatIm not sure I should dare to undertake it if it were not for her having such a treasure of a governess
Has Anna told you about our little governess
After all the worry we had last year with one impossible creature after another it seems providential just now to have found her
At first we were afraid she was too young but now weve the greatest confidence in her
So clever and amusingand SUCH a lady
I dont say her educations all it might beno drawing or singingbut one cant have everything and she speaks Italian Madame de Chantelles fond insistence on the likeness between Effie Leath and her father if not particularly gratifying to Darrow had at least increased his desire to see the little girl
It gave him an odd feeling of discomfort to think that she should have any of the characteristics of the late Fraser Leath he had somehow fantastically pictured her as the mystical offspring of the early tenderness between himself and Anna Summers
His encounter with Effie took place the next morning on the lawn below the terrace where he found her in the early sunshine knocking about golf balls with her brother
Almost at once and with infinite relief he saw that the resemblance of which Madame de Chantelle boasted was mainly external
Even that discovery was slightly distasteful though Darrow was forced to own that Fraser Leaths straightfeatured fairness had lent itself to the production of a peculiarly finished image of childish purity
But it was evident that other elements had also gone to the making of Effie and that another spirit sat in her eyes
Her serious handshake her pretty greeting were worthy of the Leath tradition and he guessed her to be more malleable than Owen more subject to the influences of Givre but the shout with which she returned to her romp had in it the note of her mothers emancipation
He had begged a holiday for her and when Mrs Leath appeared he and she and the little girl went off for a ramble
Anna wished her daughter to have time to make friends with Darrow before learning in what relation he was to stand to her and the three roamed the woods and fields till the distant chime of the stableclock made them turn back for luncheon
Effie who was attended by a shaggy terrier had picked up two or three subordinate dogs at the stable and as she trotted on ahead with her yapping escort Anna hung back to throw a look at Darrow
Yes he answered it shes exquisiteOh I see what Im asking of you
But shell be quite happy here wont she
And you must remember it wont be for long Anna sighed her acquiescence
Oh shell be happy here
Its her nature to be happy
Shell apply herself to it conscientiously as she does to her lessons and to what she calls being goodIn a way you see thats just what worries me
Her idea of being good is to please the person shes withshe puts her whole dear little mind on it
And so if ever shes with the wrong person But surely theres no danger of that just now
Madame de Chantelle tells me that youve at last put your hand on a perfect governess Anna without answering glanced away from him toward her daughter
Its lucky at any rate Darrow continued that Madame de Chantelle thinks her so
Oh I think very highly of her too
Highly enough to feel quite satisfied to leave her with Effie
Yes
Shes just the person for Effie
Only of course one never knowsShes young and she might take it into her head to leave us After a pause she added Im naturally anxious to know what you think of her
When they entered the house the hands of the hall clock stood within a few minutes of the luncheon hour
Anna led Effie off to have her hair smoothed and Darrow wandered into the oak sittingroom which he found untenanted
The sun lay pleasantly on its brown walls on the scattered books and the flowers in old porcelain vases
In his eyes lingered the vision of the darkhaired mother mounting the stairs with her little fair daughter
The contrast between them seemed a last touch of grace in the complex harmony of things
He stood in the window looking out at the park and brooding inwardly upon his happiness
He was roused by Effies voice and the scamper of her feet down the long floors behind him
Here he is
Here he is
she cried flying over the threshold
He turned and stooped to her with a smile and as she caught his hand he perceived that she was trying to draw him toward some one who had paused behind her in the doorway and whom he supposed to be her mother
HERE he is
Effie repeated with her sweet impatience
The figure in the doorway came forward and Darrow looking up found himself face to face with Sophy Viner
They stood still a yard or two apart and looked at each other without speaking
As they paused there a shadow fell across one of the terrace windows and Owen Leath stepped whistling into the room
In his rough shooting clothes with the glow of exercise under his fair skin he looked extraordinarily lighthearted and happy
Darrow with a quick sideglance noticed this and perceived also that the glow on the youths cheek had deepened suddenly to red
He too stopped short and the three stood there motionless for a barely perceptible beat of time
During its lapse Darrows eyes had turned back from Owens face to that of the girl between them
He had the sense that whatever was done it was he who must do it and that it must be done immediately
He went forward and held out his hand
How do you do Miss Viner
She answered How do you do
in a voice that sounded clear and natural and the next moment he again became aware of steps behind him and knew that Mrs Leath was in the room
To his strained senses there seemed to be another just measurable pause before Anna said looking gaily about the little group Has Owen introduced you
This is Effies friend Miss Viner
Effie still hanging on her governesss arm pressed herself closer with a little gesture of appropriation and Miss Viner laid her hand on her pupils hair
Darrow felt that Annas eyes had turned to him
I think Miss Viner and I have met alreadyseveral years ago in London
I remember said Sophy Viner in the same clear voice
How charming
Then were all friends
But luncheon must be ready said Mrs Leath
She turned back to the door and the little procession moved down the two long drawingrooms with Effie waltzing on ahead
XV Madame de Chantelle and Anna had planned for the afternoon a visit to a remotely situated acquaintance whom the introduction of the motor had transformed into a neighbour
Effie was to pay for her mornings holiday by an hour or two in the schoolroom and Owen suggested that he and Darrow should betake themselves to a distant covert in the desultory quest for pheasants
Darrow was not an ardent sportsman but any pretext for physical activity would have been acceptable at the moment and he was glad both to get away from the house and not to be left to himself
When he came downstairs the motor was at the door and Anna stood before the hall mirror swathing her hat in veils
She turned at the sound of his step and smiled at him for a long full moment
Id no idea you knew Miss Viner she said as he helped her into her long coat
It came back to me luckily that Id seen her two or three times in London several years ago
She was secretary or something of the sort in the background of a house where I used to dine
He loathed the slighting indifference of the phrase but he had uttered it deliberately had been secretly practising it all through the interminable hour at the luncheontable
Now that it was spoken he shivered at its note of condescension
In such cases one was almost sure to overdoBut Anna seemed to notice nothing unusual
Was she really
You must tell me all about ittell me exactly how she struck you
Im so glad it turns out that you know her
Know is rather exaggerated we used to pass each other on the stairs
Madame de Chantelle and Owen appeared together as he spoke and Anna gathering up her wraps said Youll tell me about that then
Try and remember everything you can
As he tramped through the woods at his young hosts side Darrow felt the partial relief from thought produced by exercise and the obligation to talk
Little as he cared for shooting he had the habit of concentration which makes it natural for a man to throw himself wholly into whatever business he has in hand and there were moments of the afternoon when a sudden whirr in the undergrowth a vivider gleam against the hazy browns and greys of the woods was enough to fill the foreground of his attention
But all the while behind these voluntarily emphasized sensations his secret consciousness continued to revolve on a loud wheel of thought
For a time it seemed to be sweeping him through deep gulfs of darkness
His sensations were too swift and swarming to be disentangled
He had an almost physical sense of struggling for air of battling helplessly with material obstructions as though the russet covert through which he trudged were the heart of a maleficent jungle Snatches of his companions talk drifted to him intermittently through the confusion of his thoughts
He caught eager selfrevealing phrases and understood that Owen was saying things about himself perhaps hinting indirectly at the hopes for which Darrow had been prepared by Annas confidences
He had already become aware that the lad liked him and had meant to take the first opportunity of showing that he reciprocated the feeling
But the effort of fixing his attention on Owens words was so great that it left no power for more than the briefest and most inexpressive replies
Young Leath it appeared felt that he had reached a turningpoint in his career a height from which he could impartially survey his past progress and projected endeavour
At one time he had had musical and literary yearnings visions of desultory artistic indulgence but these had of late been superseded by the resolute determination to plunge into practical life
I dont want you see Darrow heard him explaining to drift into what my grandmother poor dear is trying to make of me an adjunct of Givre
I dont wanthang it allto slip into collecting sensations as my father collected snuffboxes
I want Effie to have Givreits my grandmothers you know to do as she likes with and Ive understood lately that if it belonged to me it would gradually gobble me up
I want to get out of it into a life thats big and ugly and struggling
If I can extract beauty out of THAT so much the better thatll prove my vocation
But I want to MAKE beauty not be drowned in the readymade like a bee in a pot of honey
Darrow knew that he was being appealed to for corroboration of these views and for encouragement in the course to which they pointed
To his own ears his answers sounded now curt now irrelevant at one moment he seemed chillingly indifferent at another he heard himself launching out on a flood of hazy discursiveness
He dared not look at Owen for fear of detecting the lads surprise at these senseless transitions
And through the confusion of his inward struggles and outward loquacity he heard the ceaseless trip hammer beat of the question What in Gods name shall I do
To get back to the house before Annas return seemed his most pressing necessity
He did not clearly know why he simply felt that he ought to be there
At one moment it occurred to him that Miss Viner might want to speak to him aloneand again in the same flash that it would probably be the last thing she would wantAt any rate he felt he ought to try to speak to HER or at least be prepared to do so if the chance should occur
Finally toward four he told his companion that he had some letters on his mind and must get back to the house and despatch them before the ladies returned
He left Owen with the beater and walked on to the edge of the covert
At the park gates he struck obliquely through the trees following a grass avenue at the end of which he had caught a glimpse of the roof of the chapel
A grey haze had blotted out the sun and the still air clung about him tepidly
At length the housefront raised before him its expanse of damp silvered brick and he was struck afresh by the high decorum of its calm lines and soberly massed surfaces
It made him feel in the turbid coil of his fears and passions like a muddy tramp forcing his way into some pure sequestered shrine By and bye he knew he should have to think the complex horror out slowly systematically bit by bit but for the moment it was whirling him about so fast that he could just clutch at its sharp spikes and be tossed off again
Only one definite immediate fact stuck in his quivering grasp
He must give the girl every chancemust hold himself passive till she had taken them
In the court Effie ran up to him with her leaping terrier
I was coming out to meet youyou and Owen
Miss Viner was coming too and then she couldnt because shes got such a headache
Im afraid I gave it to her because I did my division so disgracefully
Its too bad isnt it
But wont you walk back with me
Nurse wont mind the least bit shed so much rather go in to tea
Darrow excused himself laughingly on the plea that he had letters to write which was much worse than having a headache and not infrequently resulted in one
Oh then you can go and write them in Owens study
Thats where gentlemen always write their letters
She flew on with her dog and Darrow pursued his way to the house
Effies suggestion struck him as useful
He had pictured himself as vaguely drifting about the drawing rooms and had perceived the difficulty of Miss Viners having to seek him there but the study a small room on the right of the hall was in easy sight from the staircase and so situated that there would be nothing marked in his being found there in talk with her
He went in leaving the door open and sat down at the writingtable
The room was a friendly heterogeneous place the one repository in the wellordered and amplyservanted house of all its unclassified odds and ends Effies croquetbox and fishing rods Owens guns and golfsticks and racquets his stepmothers flowerbaskets and gardening implements even Madame de Chantelles embroidery frame and the back numbers of the Catholic Weekly
The early twilight had begun to fall and presently a slanting ray across the desk showed Darrow that a servant was coming across the hall with a lamp
He pulled out a sheet of notepaper and began to write at random while the man entering put the lamp at his elbow and vaguely straightened the heap of newspapers tossed on the divan
Then his steps died away and Darrow sat leaning his head on his locked hands
Presently another step sounded on the stairs wavered a moment and then moved past the threshold of the study
Darrow got up and walked into the hall which was still unlighted
In the dimness he saw Sophy Viner standing by the hall door in her hat and jacket
She stopped at sight of him her hand on the doorbolt and they stood for a second without speaking
Have you seen Effie
she suddenly asked
She went out to meet you
She DID meet me just now in the court
Shes gone on to join her brother
Darrow spoke as naturally as he could but his voice sounded to his own ears like an amateur actors in a light part
Miss Viner without answering drew back the bolt
He watched her in silence as the door swung open then he said She has her nurse with her
She wont be long
She stood irresolute and he added I was writing in there wont you come and have a little talk
Every ones out
The last words struck him as not wellchosen but there was no time to choose
She paused a second longer and then crossed the threshold of the study
At luncheon she had sat with her back to the window and beyond noting that she had grown a little thinner and had less colour and vivacity he had seen no change in her but now as the lamplight fell on her face its whiteness startled him
Poor thingpoor thingwhat in heavens name can she suppose
he wondered
Do sit downI want to talk to you he said and pushed a chair toward her
She did not seem to see it or if she did she deliberately chose another seat
He came back to his own chair and leaned his elbows on the blotter
She faced him from the farther side of the table
You promised to let me hear from you now and then he began awkwardly and with a sharp sense of his awkwardness
A faint smile made her face more tragic
Did I
There was nothing to tell
Ive had no historylike the happy countries He waited a moment before asking You ARE happy here
I WAS she said with a faint emphasis
Why do you say was
Youre surely not thinking of going
There cant be kinder people anywhere
Darrow hardly knew what he was saying but her answer came to him with deadly definiteness
I suppose it depends on you whether I go or stay
On me
He stared at her across Owens scattered papers
Good God
What can you think of me to say that
The mockery of the question flashed back at him from her wretched face
She stood up wandered away and leaned an instant in the darkening windowframe
From there she turned to fling back at him Dont imagine Im the least bit sorry for anything
He steadied his elbows on the table and hid his face in his hands
It was harder oh damnably harder than he had expected
Arguments expedients palliations evasions all seemed to be slipping away from him he was left face to face with the mere graceless fact of his inferiority
He lifted his head to ask at random Youve been here then ever since
Since June yes
It turned out that the Farlows were hunting for meall the whilefor this
She stood facing him her back to the window evidently impatient to be gone yet with something still to say or that she expected to hear him say
The sense of her expectancy benumbed him
What in heavens name could he say to her that was not an offense or a mockery
Your idea of the theatreyou gave that up at once then
Oh the theatre
She gave a little laugh
I couldnt wait for the theatre
I had to take the first thing that offered I took this
He pushed on haltingly Im gladextremely gladyoure happy hereId counted on your letting me know if there was anything I could doThe theatre nowif you still regret itif youre not contented hereI know people in that line in LondonIm certain I can manage it for you when I get back She moved up to the table and leaned over it to ask in a voice that was hardly above a whisper Then you DO want me to leave
Is that it
He dropped his arms with a groan
Good heavens
How can you think such things
At the time you know I begged you to let me do what I could but you wouldnt hear of itand ever since Ive been wanting to be of useto do something anything to help you She heard him through motionless without a quiver of the clasped hands she rested on the edge of the table
If you want to help me thenyou can help me to stay here she brought out with lowtoned intensity
Through the stillness of the pause which followed the bray of a motorhorn sounded far down the drive
Instantly she turned with a last white look at him and fled from the room and up the stairs
He stood motionless benumbed by the shock of her last words
She was afraid thenafraid of himsick with fear of him
The discovery beat him down to a lower depth
The motorhorn sounded again close at hand and he turned and went up to his room
His letterwriting was a sufficient pretext for not immediately joining the party about the teatable and he wanted to be alone and try to put a little order into his tumultuous thinking
Upstairs the room held out the intimate welcome of its lamp and fire
Everything in it exhaled the same sense of peace and stability which two evenings before had lulled him to complacent meditation
His armchair again invited him from the hearth but he was too agitated to sit still and with sunk head and hands clasped behind his back he began to wander up and down the room
His five minutes with Sophy Viner had flashed strange lights into the shadowy corners of his consciousness
The girls absolute candour her hard ardent honesty was for the moment the vividest point in his thoughts
He wondered anew as he had wondered before at the way in which the harsh discipline of life had stripped her of false sentiment without laying the least touch on her pride
When they had parted five months before she had quietly but decidedly rejected all his offers of help even to the suggestion of his trying to further her theatrical aims she had made it clear that she wished their brief alliance to leave no trace on their lives save that of its own smiling memory
But now that they were unexpectedly confronted in a situation which seemed to her terrified fancy to put her at his mercy her first impulse was to defend her right to the place she had won and to learn as quickly as possible if he meant to dispute it
While he had pictured her as shrinking away from him in a tremor of selfeffacement she had watched his movements made sure of her opportunity and come straight down to have it out with him
He was so struck by the frankness and energy of the proceeding that for a moment he lost sight of the view of his own character implied in it
Poor thingpoor thing
he could only go on saying and with the repetition of the words the picture of himself as she must see him pitiably took shape again
He understood then for the first time how vague in comparison with hers had been his own vision of the part he had played in the brief episode of their relation
The incident had left in him a sense of exasperation and self contempt but that as he now perceived was chiefly if not altogether as it bore on his preconceived ideal of his attitude toward another woman
He had fallen below his own standard of sentimental loyalty and if he thought of Sophy Viner it was mainly as the chance instrument of his lapse
These considerations were not agreeable to his pride but they were forced on him by the example of her valiant commonsense
If he had cut a sorry figure in the business he owed it to her not to close his eyes to the fact any longer
But when he opened them what did he see
The situation detestable at best would yet have been relatively simple if protecting Sophy Viner had been the only duty involved in it
The fact that that duty was paramount did not do away with the contingent obligations
It was Darrows instinct in difficult moments to go straight to the bottom of the difficulty but he had never before had to take so dark a dive as this and for the minute he shivered on the brinkWell his first duty at any rate was to the girl he must let her see that he meant to fulfill it to the last jot and then try to find out how to square the fulfillment with the other problems already in his path XVI In the oak room he found Mrs Leath her motherinlaw and Effie
The group as he came toward it down the long drawingrooms composed itself prettily about the teatable
The lamps and the fire crossed their gleams on silver and porcelain on the bright haze of Effies hair and on the whiteness of Annas forehead as she leaned back in her chair behind the teaurn
She did not move at Darrows approach but lifted to him a deep gaze of peace and confidence
The look seemed to throw about him the spell of a divine security he felt the joy of a convalescent suddenly waking to find the sunlight on his face
Madame de Chantelle across her knitting discoursed of their afternoons excursion with occasional pauses induced by the hypnotic effect of the fresh air and Effie kneeling on the hearth softly but insistently sought to implant in her terriers mind some notion of the relation between a vertical attitude and sugar
Darrow took a chair behind the little girl so that he might look across at her mother
It was almost a necessity for him at the moment to let his eyes rest on Annas face and to meet now and then the proud shyness of her gaze
Madame de Chantelle presently enquired what had become of Owen and a moment later the window behind her opened and her grandson gun in hand came in from the terrace
As he stood there in the lamplight with dead leaves and bits of bramble clinging to his mudspattered clothes the scent of the night about him and its chill on his pale bright face he really had the look of a young faun strayed in from the forest
Effie abandoned the terrier to fly to him
Oh Owen where in the world have you been
I walked miles and miles with Nurse and couldnt find you and we met Jean and he said he didnt know where youd gone
Nobody knows where I go or what I see when I get there thats the beauty of it
he laughed back at her
But if youre good he added Ill tell you about it one of these days
Oh now Owen now
I dont really believe Ill ever be much better than I am now
Let Owen have his tea first her mother suggested but the young man declining the offer propped his gun against the wall and lighting a cigarette began to pace up and down the room in a way that reminded Darrow of his own caged wanderings
Effie pursued him with her blandishments and for a while he poured out to her a lowvoiced stream of nonsense then he sat down beside his stepmother and leaned over to help himself to tea
Wheres Miss Viner
he asked as Effie climbed up on him
Why isnt she here to chain up this ungovernable infant
Poor Miss Viner has a headache
Effie says she went to her room as soon as lessons were over and sent word that she wouldnt be down for tea
Ah said Owen abruptly setting down his cup
He stood up lit another cigarette and wandered away to the piano in the room beyond
From the twilight where he sat a lonely music borne on fantastic chords floated to the group about the teatable
Under its influence Madame de Chantelles meditative pauses increased in length and frequency and Effie stretched herself on the hearth her drowsy head against the dog
Presently her nurse appeared and Anna rose at the same time
Stop a minute in my sittingroom on your way up she paused to say to Darrow as she went
A few hours earlier her request would have brought him instantly to his feet
She had given him on the day of his arrival an inviting glimpse of the spacious booklined room above stairs in which she had gathered together all the tokens of her personal tastes the retreat in which as one might fancy Anna Leath had hidden the restless ghost of Anna Summers and the thought of a talk with her there had been in his mind ever since
But now he sat motionless as if spellbound by the play of Madame de Chantelles needles and the pulsations of Owens fitful music
She will want to ask me about the girl he repeated to himself with a fresh sense of the insidious taint that embittered all his thoughts the hand of the slender columned clock on the mantelpiece had spanned a halfhour before shame at his own indecision finally drew him to his feet
From her writingtable where she sat over a pile of letters Anna lifted her happy smile
The impulse to press his lips to it made him come close and draw her upward
She threw her head back as if surprised at the abruptness of the gesture then her face leaned to his with the slow droop of a flower
He felt again the sweep of the secret tides and all his fears went down in them
She sat down in the sofacorner by the fire and he drew an armchair close to her
His gaze roamed peacefully about the quiet room
Its just like youit is you he said as his eyes came back to her
Its a good place to be alone inI dont think Ive ever before cared to talk with any one here
Lets be quiet then its the best way of talking
Yes but we must save it up till later
There are things I want to say to you now
He leaned back in his chair
Say them then and Ill listen
Oh no
I want you to tell me about Miss Viner
About Miss Viner
He summoned up a look of faint interrogation
He thought she seemed surprised at his surprise
Its important naturally she explained that I should find out all I can about her before I leave
Important on Effies account
On Effies accountof course
Of courseBut youve every reason to be satisfied havent you
Every apparent reason
We all like her
Effies very fond of her and she seems to have a delightful influence on the child
But we know so little after allabout her antecedents I mean and her past history
Thats why I want you to try and recall everything you heard about her when you used to see her in London
Oh on that score Im afraid I shant be of much use
As I told you she was a mere shadow in the background of the house I saw her inand that was four or five years ago When she was with a Mrs
Murrett
Yes an appalling woman who runs a roaring dinnerfactory that used now and then to catch me in its wheels
I escaped from them long ago but in my time there used to be half a dozen fagged hands to tend the machine and Miss Viner was one of them
Im glad shes out of it poor girl
Then you never really saw anything of her there
I never had the chance
Mrs Murrett discouraged any competition on the part of her subordinates
Especially such pretty ones I suppose
Darrow made no comment and she continued And Mrs Murretts own opinion if shed offered you oneprobably wouldnt have been of much value
Only in so far as her disapproval would on general principles have been a good mark for Miss Viner
But surely he went on after a pause you could have found out about her from the people through whom you first heard of her
Anna smiled
Oh we heard of her through Adelaide Painter  and in reply to his glance of interrogation she explained that the lady in question was a spinster of South Braintree Massachusetts who having come to Paris some thirty years earlier to nurse a brother through an illness had ever since protestingly and provisionally camped there in a state of contemptuous protestation oddly manifested by her never taking the slipcovers off her drawingroom chairs
Her long residence on Gallic soil had not mitigated her hostility toward the creed and customs of the race but though she always referred to the Catholic Church as the Scarlet Woman and took the darkest views of French private life Madame de Chantelle placed great reliance on her judgment and experience and in every domestic crisis the irreducible Adelaide was immediately summoned to Givre
Its all the odder because my motherinlaw since her second marriage has lived so much in the country that shes practically lost sight of all her other American friends
Besides which you can see how completely she has identified herself with Monsieur de Chantelles nationality and adopted French habits and prejudices
Yet when anything goes wrong she always sends for Adelaide Painter whos more American than the Stars and Stripes and might have left South Braintree yesterday if she hadnt rather brought it over with her in her trunk
Darrow laughed
Well then if South Braintree vouches for Miss Viner Oh but only indirectly
When we had that odious adventure with Mademoiselle Grumeau whod been so highly recommended by Monsieur de Chantelles aunt the Chanoinesse Adelaide was of course sent for and she said at once Im not the least bit surprised
Ive always told you that what you wanted for Effie was a sweet American girl and not one of these nasty foreigners
Unluckily she couldnt at the moment put her hand on a sweet American but she presently heard of Miss Viner through the Farlows an excellent couple who live in the Quartier Latin and write about French life for the American papers
I was only too thankful to find anyone who was vouched for by decent people and so far Ive had no cause to regret my choice
But I know after all very little about Miss Viner and there are all kinds of reasons why I want as soon as possible to find out more to find out all I can
Since youve got to leave Effie I understand your feeling in that way
But is there in such a case any recommendation worth half as much as your own direct experience
No and its been so favourable that I was ready to accept it as conclusive
Only naturally when I found youd known her in London I was in hopes youd give me some more specific reasons for liking her as much as I do
Im afraid I can give you nothing more specific than my general vague impression that she seems very plucky and extremely nice
You dont at any rate know anything specific to the contrary
To the contrary
How should I
Im not conscious of ever having heard any one say two words about her
I only infer that she must have pluck and character to have stuck it out so long at Mrs
Murretts
Yes poor thing
She has pluck certainly and pride too which must have made it all the harder
Anna rose to her feet
You dont know how glad I am that your impressions on the whole so good
I particularly wanted you to like her
He drew her to him with a smile
On that condition Im prepared to love even Adelaide Painter
I almost hope you wont have the chance topoor Adelaide
Her appearance here always coincides with a catastrophe
Oh then I must manage to meet her elsewhere
He held Anna closer saying to himself as he smoothed back the hair from her forehead What does anything matter but just THIS
Must I go now
he added aloud
She answered absently It must be time to dress then she drew back a little and laid her hands on his shoulders
My loveoh my dear love
she said
It came to him that they were the first words of endearment he had heard her speak and their rareness gave them a magic quality of reassurance as though no danger could strike through such a shield
A knock on the door made them draw apart
Anna lifted her hand to her hair and Darrow stooped to examine a photograph of Effie on the writingtable
Come in
Anna said
The door opened and Sophy Viner entered
Seeing Darrow she drew back
Do come in Miss Viner Anna repeated looking at her kindly
The girl a quick red in her cheeks still hesitated on the threshold
Im so sorry but Effie has mislaid her Latin grammar and I thought she might have left it here
I need it to prepare for tomorrows lesson
Is this it
Darrow asked picking up a book from the table
Oh thank you
He held it out to her and she took it and moved to the door
Wait a minute please Miss Viner Anna said and as the girl turned back she went on with her quiet smile Effie told us youd gone to your room with a headache
You mustnt sit up over tomorrows lessons if you dont feel well
Sophys blush deepened
But you see I have to
Latins one of my weak points and theres generally only one page of this book between me and Effie
She threw the words off with a halfironic smile
Do excuse my disturbing you she added
You didnt disturb me Anna answered
Darrow perceived that she was looking intently at the girl as though struck by something tense and tremulous in her face her voice her whole mien and attitude
You DO look tired
Youd much better go straight to bed
Effie wont be sorry to skip her Latin
Thank youbut Im really all right murmured Sophy Viner
Her glance making a swift circuit of the room dwelt for an appreciable instant on the intimate propinquity of armchair and sofacorner then she turned back to the door
BOOK III XVII At dinner that evening Madame de Chantelles slender monologue was thrown out over gulfs of silence
Owen was still in the same state of moody abstraction as when Darrow had left him at the piano and even Annas face to her friends vigilant eye revealed not perhaps a personal preoccupation but a vague sense of impending disturbance
She smiled she bore a part in the talk her eyes dwelt on Darrows with their usual deep reliance but beneath the surface of her serenity his tense perceptions detected a hidden stir
He was sufficiently selfpossessed to tell himself that it was doubtless due to causes with which he was not directly concerned
He knew the question of Owens marriage was soon to be raised and the abrupt alteration in the young mans mood made it seem probable that he was himself the centre of the atmospheric disturbance For a moment it occurred to Darrow that Anna might have employed her afternoon in preparing Madame de Chantelle for her grandsons impending announcement but a glance at the elder ladys unclouded brow showed that he must seek elsewhere the clue to Owens taciturnity and his stepmothers concern
Possibly Anna had found reason to change her own attitude in the matter and had made the change known to Owen
But this again was negatived by the fact that during the afternoons shooting young Leath had been in a mood of almost extravagant expansiveness and that from the moment of his late return to the house till just before dinner there had been to Darrows certain knowledge no possibility of a private talk between himself and his stepmother
This obscured if it narrowed the field of conjecture and Darrows gropings threw him back on the conclusion that he was probably reading too much significance into the moods of a lad he hardly knew and who had been described to him as subject to sudden changes of humour
As to Annas fancied perturbation it might simply be due to the fact that she had decided to plead Owens cause the next day and had perhaps already had a glimpse of the difficulties awaiting her
But Darrow knew that he was too deep in his own perplexities to judge the mental state of those about him
It might be after all that the variations he felt in the currents of communication were caused by his own inward tremor
Such at any rate was the conclusion he had reached when shortly after the two ladies left the drawingroom he bade Owen goodnight and went up to his room
Ever since the rapid selfcolloquy which had followed on his first sight of Sophy Viner he had known there were other questions to be faced behind the one immediately confronting him
On the score of that one at least his mind if not easy was relieved
He had done what was possible to reassure the girl and she had apparently recognized the sincerity of his intention
He had patched up as decent a conclusion as he could to an incident that should obviously have had no sequel but he had known all along that with the securing of Miss Viners peace of mind only a part of his obligation was discharged and that with that part his remaining duty was in conflict
It had been his first business to convince the girl that their secret was safe with him but it was far from easy to square this with the equally urgent obligation of safeguarding Annas responsibility toward her child
Darrow was not much afraid of accidental disclosures
Both he and Sophy Viner had too much at stake not to be on their guard
The fear that beset him was of another kind and had a profounder source
He wanted to do all he could for the girl but the fact of having had to urge Anna to confide Effie to her was peculiarly repugnant to him
His own ideas about Sophy Viner were too mixed and indeterminate for him not to feel the risk of such an experiment yet he found himself in the intolerable position of appearing to press it on the woman he desired above all others to protect Till late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of indecision
His pride was humbled by the discrepancy between what Sophy Viner had been to him and what he had thought of her
This discrepancy which at the time had seemed to simplify the incident now turned out to be its most galling complication
The bare truth indeed was that he had hardly thought of her at all either at the time or since and that he was ashamed to base his judgement of her on his meagre memory of their adventure
The essential cheapness of the whole affairas far as his share in it was concernedcame home to him with humiliating distinctness
He would have liked to be able to feel that at the time at least he had staked something more on it and had somehow in the sequel had a more palpable loss to show
But the plain fact was that he hadnt spent a penny on it which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score it had since been rolling up
At any rate beat about the case as he would it was clear that he owed it to Annaand incidentally to his own peace of mindto find some way of securing Sophy Viners future without leaving her installed at Givre when he and his wife should depart for their new post
The night brought no aid to the solving of this problem but it gave him at any rate the clear conviction that no time was to be lost
His first step must be to obtain from Miss Viner the chance of another and calmer talk and he resolved to seek it at the earliest hour
He had gathered that Effies lessons were preceded by an early scamper in the park and conjecturing that her governess might be with her he betook himself the next morning to the terrace whence he wandered on to the gardens and the walks beyond
The atmosphere was still and pale
The muffled sunlight gleamed like gold tissue through grey gauze and the beech alleys tapered away to a blue haze blent of sky and forest
It was one of those elusive days when the familiar forms of things seem about to dissolve in a prismatic shimmer
The stillness was presently broken by joyful barks and Darrow tracking the sound overtook Effie flying down one of the long alleys at the head of her pack
Beyond her he saw Miss Viner seated near the stonerimmed basin beside which he and Anna had paused on their first walk to the river
The girl coming forward at his approach returned his greeting almost gaily
His first glance showed him that she had regained her composure and the change in her appearance gave him the measure of her fears
For the first time he saw in her again the sidelong grace that had charmed his eyes in Paris but he saw it now as in a painted picture
Shall we sit down a minute
he asked as Effie trotted off
The girl looked away from him
Im afraid theres not much time we must be back at lessons at halfpast nine
But its barely ten minutes past
Lets at least walk a little way toward the river
She glanced down the long walk ahead of them and then back in the direction of the house
If you like she said in a low voice with one of her quick fluctuations of colour but instead of taking the way he proposed she turned toward a narrow path which branched off obliquely through the trees
Darrow was struck and vaguely troubled by the change in her look and tone
There was in them an undefinable appeal whether for help or forbearance he could not tell
Then it occurred to him that there might have been something misleading in his so pointedly seeking her and he felt a momentary constraint
To ease it he made an abrupt dash at the truth
I came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday was so unsatisfactory
I want to hear more about youabout your plans and prospects
Ive been wondering ever since why youve so completely given up the theatre
Her face instantly sharpened to distrust
I had to live she said in an offhand tone
I understand perfectly that you should like it herefor a time
His glance strayed down the goldroofed windings ahead of them
Its delightful you couldnt be better placed
Only I wonder a little at your having so completely given up any idea of a different future
She waited for a moment before answering I suppose Im less restless than I used to be
Its certainly natural that you should be less restless here than at Mrs Murretts yet somehow I dont seem to see you permanently given up to forming the young
WhatexactlyDO you seem to see me permanently given up to
You know you warned me rather emphatically against the theatre
She threw off the statement without impatience as though they were discussing together the fate of a third person in whom both were benevolently interested
Darrow considered his reply
If I did it was because you so emphatically refused to let me help you to a start
She stopped short and faced him And you think I may let you now
Darrow felt the blood in his cheek
He could not understand her attitudeif indeed she had consciously taken one and her changes of tone did not merely reflect the involuntary alternations of her mood
It humbled him to perceive once more how little he had to guide him in his judgment of her
He said to himself If Id ever cared a straw for her I should know how to avoid hurting her nowand his insensibility struck him as no better than a vulgar obtuseness
But he had a fixed purpose ahead and could only push on to it
I hope at any rate youll listen to my reasons
Theres been time on both sides to think them over since He caught himself back and hung helpless on the since whatever words he chose he seemed to stumble among reminders of their past
She walked on beside him her eyes on the ground
Then Im to understanddefinitelythat you DO renew your offer
she asked With all my heart
If youll only let me She raised a hand as though to check him
Its extremely friendly of youI DO believe you mean it as a friend but I dont quite understand why finding me as you say so well placed here you should show more anxiety about my future than at a time when I was actually and rather desperately adrift
Oh no not more
If you show any at all it must at any rate be for different reasonsIn fact it can only be she went on with one of her disconcerting flashes of astuteness for one of two reasons either because you feel you ought to help me or because for some reason you think you owe it to Mrs Leath to let her know what you know of me
Darrow stood still in the path
Behind him he heard Effies call and at the childs voice he saw Sophy turn her head with the alertness of one who is obscurely on the watch
The look was so fugitive that he could not have said wherein it differed from her normal professional air of having her pupil on her mind
Effie sprang past them and Darrow took up the girls challenge
What you suggest about Mrs Leath is hardly worth answering
As to my reasons for wanting to help you a good deal depends on the words one uses to define rather indefinite things
Its true enough that I want to help you but the wish isnt due toto any past kindness on your part but simply to my own interest in you
Why not put it that our friendship gives me the right to intervene for what I believe to be your benefit
She took a few hesitating steps and then paused again
Darrow noticed that she had grown pale and that there were rings of shade about her eyes
Youve known Mrs Leath a long time
she asked him suddenly
He paused with a sense of approaching peril
A long time yes
She told me you were friendsgreat friends Yes he admitted were great friends
Then you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling her that you dont think Im the right person for Effie
He uttered a sound of protest but she disregarded it
I dont say youd LIKE to do it
You wouldnt youd hate it
And the natural alternative would be to try to persuade me that Id be better off somewhere else than here
But supposing that failed and you saw I was determined to stay
THEN you might think it your duty to tell Mrs
Leath
She laid the case before him with a cold lucidity
I should in your place I believe she ended with a little laugh
I shouldnt feel justified in telling her behind your back if I thought you unsuited for the place but I should certainly feel justified he rejoined after a pause in telling YOU if I thought the place unsuited to you
And thats what youre trying to tell me now
Yes but not for the reasons you imagine
What then are your reasons if you please
Ive already implied them in advising you not to give up all idea of the theatre
Youre too various too gifted too personal to tie yourself down at your age to the dismal drudgery of teaching
And is THAT what youve told Mrs
Leath
She rushed the question out at him as if she expected to trip him up over it
He was moved by the simplicity of the stratagem
Ive told her exactly nothing he replied
And whatexactlydo you mean by nothing
You and she were talking about me when I came into her sittingroom yesterday
Darrow felt his blood rise at the thrust
Ive told her simply that Id seen you once or twice at Mrs
Murretts
And not that youve ever seen me since
And not that Ive ever seen you since And she believes youshe completely believes you
He uttered a protesting exclamation and his flush reflected itself in the girls cheek
Oh I beg your pardon
I didnt mean to ask you that
She halted and again cast a rapid glance behind and ahead of her
Then she held out her hand
Well then thank you and let me relieve your fears
I shant be Effies governess much longer
At the announcement Darrow tried to merge his look of relief into the expression of friendly interest with which he grasped her hand
You really do agree with me then
And youll give me a chance to talk things over with you
She shook her head with a faint smile
Im not thinking of the stage
Ive had another offer thats all
The relief was hardly less great
After all his personal responsibility ceased with her departure from Givre
Youll tell me about that thenwont you
Her smile flickered up
Oh youll hear about it soonI must catch Effie now and drag her back to the blackboard
She walked on for a few yards and then paused again and confronted him
Ive been odious to youand not quite honest she broke out suddenly
Not quite honest
he repeated caught in a fresh wave of wonder
I mean in seeming not to trust you
Its come over me again as we talked that at heart Ive always KNOWN I could Her colour rose in a bright wave and her eyes clung to his for a swift instant of reminder and appeal
For the same space of time the past surged up in him confusedly then a veil dropped between them
Heres Effie now
she exclaimed
He turned and saw the little girl trotting back to them her hand in Owen Leaths
Even through the stir of his subsiding excitement Darrow was at once aware of the change effected by the young mans approach
For a moment Sophy Viners cheeks burned redder then they faded to the paleness of white petals
She lost however nothing of the bright bravery which it was her way to turn on the unexpected
Perhaps no one less familiar with her face than Darrow would have discerned the tension of the smile she transferred from himself to Owen Leath or have remarked that her eyes had hardened from misty grey to a shining darkness
But her observer was less struck by this than by the corresponding change in Owen Leath
The latter when he came in sight had been laughing and talking unconcernedly with Effie but as his eye fell on Miss Viner his expression altered as suddenly as hers
The change for Darrow was less definable but perhaps for that reason it struck him as more sharply significant
Onlyjust what did it signify
Owen like Sophy Viner had the kind of face which seems less the stage on which emotions move than the very stuff they work in
In moments of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow fluid to unmake and remake themselves like the shadows of clouds on a stream
Darrow through the rapid flight of the shadows could not seize on any specific indication of feeling he merely perceived that the young man was unaccountably surprised at finding him with Miss Viner and that the extent of his surprise might cover all manner of implications
Darrows first idea was that Owen if he suspected that the conversation was not the result of an accidental encounter might wonder at his stepmothers suitor being engaged at such an hour in private talk with her little girls governess
The thought was so disturbing that as the three turned back to the house he was on the point of saying to Owen I came out to look for your mother
But in the contingency he feared even so simple a phrase might seem like an awkward attempt at explanation and he walked on in silence at Miss Viners side
Presently he was struck by the fact that Owen Leath and the girl were silent also and this gave a new turn to his thoughts
Silence may be as variously shaded as speech and that which enfolded Darrow and his two companions seemed to his watchful perceptions to be quivering with crossthreads of communication
At first he was aware only of those that centred in his own troubled consciousness then it occurred to him that an equal activity of intercourse was going on outside of it
Something was in fact passing mutely and rapidly between young Leath and Sophy Viner but what it was and whither it tended Darrow when they reached the house was but just beginning to divine XVIII Anna Leath from the terrace watched the return of the little group
She looked down on them as they advanced across the garden from the serene height of her unassailable happiness
There they were coming toward her in the mild morning light her child her stepson her promised husband the three beings who filled her life
She smiled a little at the happy picture they presented Effies gambols encircling it in a moving frame within which the two men came slowly forward in the silence of friendly understanding
It seemed part of the deep intimacy of the scene that they should not be talking to each other and it did not till afterward strike her as odd that neither of them apparently felt it necessary to address a word to Sophy Viner
Anna herself at the moment was floating in the midcurrent of felicity on a tide so bright and buoyant that she seemed to be one with its warm waves
The first rush of bliss had stunned and dazzled her but now that each morning she woke to the calm certainty of its recurrence she was growing used to the sense of security it gave
I feel as if I could trust my happiness to carry me as if it had grown out of me like wings
So she phrased it to Darrow as later in the morning they paced the garden paths together
His answering look gave her the same assurance of safety
The evening before he had seemed preoccupied and the shadow of his mood had faintly encroached on the great golden orb of their blessedness but now it was uneclipsed again and hung above them high and bright as the sun at noon
Upstairs in her sittingroom that afternoon she was thinking of these things
The morning mists had turned to rain compelling the postponement of an excursion in which the whole party were to have joined
Effie with her governess had been despatched in the motor to do some shopping at Francheuil and Anna had promised Darrow to join him later in the afternoon for a quick walk in the rain
He had gone to his room after luncheon to get some belated letters off his conscience and when he had left her she had continued to sit in the same place her hands crossed on her knees her head slightly bent in an attitude of brooding retrospection
As she looked back at her past life it seemed to her to have consisted of one ceaseless effort to pack into each hour enough to fill out its slack folds but now each moment was like a misers bag stretched to bursting with pure gold
She was roused by the sound of Owens step in the gallery outside her room
It paused at her door and in answer to his knock she called out Come in
As the door closed behind him she was struck by his look of pale excitement and an impulse of compunction made her say Youve come to ask me why I havent spoken to your grandmother
He sent about him a glance vaguely reminding her of the strange look with which Sophy Viner had swept the room the night before then his brilliant eyes came back to her
Ive spoken to her myself he said
Anna started up incredulous
Youve spoken to her
When
Just now
I left her to come here
Annas first feeling was one of annoyance
There was really something comically incongruous in this boyish surrender to impulse on the part of a young man so eager to assume the responsibilities of life
She looked at him with a faintly veiled amusement
You asked me to help you and I promised you I would
It was hardly worth while to work out such an elaborate plan of action if you intended to take the matter out of my hands without telling me
Oh dont take that tone with me
he broke out almost angrily
That tone
What tone
She stared at his quivering face
I might she pursued still halflaughing more properly make that request of YOU
Owen reddened and his vehemence suddenly subsided
I meant that I HAD to speakthats all
You dont give me a chance to explain She looked at him gently wondering a little at her own impatience
Owen
Dont I always want to give you every chance
Its because I DO that I wanted to talk to your grandmother firstthat I was waiting and watching for the right moment The right moment
So was I
Thats why Ive spoken
His voice rose again and took the sharp edge it had in moments of high pressure
His stepmother turned away and seated herself in her sofa corner
Oh my dear its not a privilege to quarrel over
Youve taken a load off my shoulders
Sit down and tell me all about it
He stood before her irresolute
I cant sit down he said
Walk about then
Only tell me Im impatient
His immediate response was to throw himself into the armchair at her side where he lounged for a moment without speaking his legs stretched out his arms locked behind his thrownback head
Anna her eyes on his face waited quietly for him to speak
Wellof course it was just what one expected
She takes it so badly you mean
All the heavy batteries were brought up my father Givre Monsieur de Chantelle the throne and the altar
Even my poor mother was dragged out of oblivion and armed with imaginary protests
Anna sighed out her sympathy
Wellyou were prepared for all that
I thought I was till I began to hear her say it
Then it sounded so incredibly silly that I told her so
Oh OwenOwen
Yes I know
I was a fool but I couldnt help it
And youve mortally offended her I suppose
Thats exactly what I wanted to prevent
She laid a hand on his shoulder
You tiresome boy not to wait and let me speak for you
He moved slightly away so that her hand slipped from its place
You dont understand he said frowning
I dont see how I can till you explain
If you thought the time had come to tell your grandmother why not have asked me to do it
I had my reasons for waiting but if youd told me to speak I should have done so naturally
He evaded her appeal by a sudden turn
What WERE your reasons for waiting
Anna did not immediately answer
Her stepsons eyes were on her face and under his gaze she felt a faint disquietude
I was feeling my wayI wanted to be absolutely sure Absolutely sure of what
She delayed again for a just perceptible instant
Why simply of OUR side of the case
But you told me you were the other day when we talked it over before they came back from Ouchy
Oh my dearif you think that in such a complicated matter every day every hour doesnt more or less modify ones surest sureness
Thats just what Im driving at
I want to know what has modified yours
She made a slight gesture of impatience
What does it matter now the things done
I dont know that I could give any clear reason He got to his feet and stood looking down on her with a tormented brow
But its absolutely necessary that you should
At his tone her impatience flared up
Its not necessary that I should give you any explanation whatever since youve taken the matter out of my hands
All I can say is that I was trying to help you that no other thought ever entered my mind
She paused a moment and then added If you doubted it you were right to do what youve done
Oh I never doubted YOU
he retorted with a fugitive stress on the pronoun
His face had cleared to its old look of trust
Dont be offended if Ive seemed to he went on
I cant quite explain myself eitherits all a kind of tangle isnt it
Thats why I thought Id better speak at once or rather why I didnt think at all but just suddenly blurted the thing out Anna gave him back his look of conciliation
Well the how and why dont much matter now
The point is how to deal with your grandmother
Youve not told me what she means to do
Oh she means to send for Adelaide Painter
The name drew a faint note of mirth from him and relaxed both their faces to a smile
Perhaps Anna added its really the best thing for us all
Owen shrugged his shoulders
Its too preposterous and humiliating
Dragging that woman into our secrets
This could hardly be a secret much longer
He had moved to the hearth where he stood pushing about the small ornaments on the mantelshelf but at her answer he turned back to her
You havent of course spoken of it to any one
No but I intend to now
She paused for his reply and as it did not come she continued If Adelaide Painters to be told theres no possible reason why I shouldnt tell Mr
Darrow
Owen abruptly set down the little statuette between his fingers
None whatever I want every one to know
She smiled a little at his overemphasis and was about to meet it with a word of banter when he continued facing her You havent as yet said a word to him
Ive told him nothing except what the discussion of our own planshis and mineobliged me to that you were thinking of marrying and that I wasnt willing to leave France till Id done what I could to see you through
At her first words the colour had rushed to his forehead but as she continued she saw his face compose itself and his blood subside
Youre a brick my dear
he exclaimed
You had my word you know
Yes yesI know
His face had clouded again
And thats allpositively allyouve ever said to him
Positively all
But why do you ask
He had a moments embarrassed hesitation
It was understood wasnt it that my grandmother was to be the first to know
Welland so she has been hasnt she since youve told her
He turned back to his restless shifting of the knickknacks
And youre sure that nothing youve said to Darrow could possibly have given him a hint
Nothing Ive said to himcertainly
He swung about on her
Why do you put it in that way
In what way
Whyas if you thought some one else might have spoken Some one else
Who else
She rose to her feet
What on earth my dear boy can you be driving at
Im trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite
Why should I think so
Do YOU
I dont know
I want to find out
She laughed at his obstinate insistence
To test my veracity I suppose
At the sound of a step in the gallery she added Here he isyou can ask him yourself
She met Darrows knock with an invitation to enter and he came into the room and paused between herself and Owen
She was struck as he stood there by the contrast between his happy careless goodlooks and her stepsons frowning agitation
Darrow met her eyes with a smile
Am I too soon
Or is our walk given up
No I was just going to get ready
She continued to linger between the two looking slowly from one to the other
But theres something we want to tell you first Owen is engaged to Miss Viner
The sense of an indefinable interrogation in Owens mind made her as she spoke fix her eyes steadily on Darrow
He had paused just opposite the window so that even in the rainy afternoon light his face was clearly open to her scrutiny
For a second immense surprise was alone visible on it so visible that she half turned to her stepson with a faint smile for his refuted suspicions
Why she wondered should Owen have thought that Darrow had already guessed his secret and what after all could be so disturbing to him in this not improbable contingency
At any rate his doubt must have been dispelled there was nothing feigned about Darrows astonishment
When her eyes turned back to him he was already crossing to Owen with outstretched hand and she had through an unaccountable faint flutter of misgiving a mere confused sense of their exchanging the customary phrases
Her next perception was of Owens tranquillized look and of his smiling return of Darrows congratulatory grasp
She had the eerie feeling of having been overswept by a shadow which there had been no cloud to cast A moment later Owen had left the room and she and Darrow were alone
He had turned away to the window and stood staring out into the downpour
Youre surprised at Owens news
she asked
Yes I am surprised he answered
You hadnt thought of its being Miss Viner
Why should I have thought of Miss Viner
You see now why I wanted so much to find out what you knew about her
He made no comment and she pursued Now that you DO know its she if theres anything He moved back into the room and went up to her
His face was serious with a slight shade of annoyance
What on earth should there be
As I told you Ive never in my life heard any one say two words about Miss Viner
Anna made no answer and they continued to face each other without moving
For the moment she had ceased to think about Sophy Viner and Owen the only thought in her mind was that Darrow was alone with her close to her and that for the first time their hands and lips had not met
He glanced back doubtfully at the window
Its pouring
Perhaps youd rather not go out
She hesitated as if waiting for him to urge her
I suppose Id better not
I ought to go at once to my mother inlawOwens just been telling her she said
Ah
Darrow hazarded a smile
That accounts for my having on my way up heard some one telephoning for Miss Painter
At the allusion they laughed together vaguely and Anna moved toward the door
He held it open for her and followed her out
XIX He left her at the door of Madame de Chantelles sitting room and plunged out alone into the rain
The wind flung about the stripped treetops of the avenue and dashed the stinging streams into his face
He walked to the gate and then turned into the highroad and strode along in the open buffeted by slanting gusts
The evenly ridged fields were a blurred waste of mud and the russet coverts which he and Owen had shot through the day before shivered desolately against a driving sky
Darrow walked on and on indifferent to the direction he was taking
His thoughts were tossing like the treetops
Annas announcement had not come to him as a complete surprise that morning as he strolled back to the house with Owen Leath and Miss Viner he had had a momentary intuition of the truth
But it had been no more than an intuition the merest faint cloudpuff of surmise and now it was an attested fact darkening over the whole sky
In respect of his own attitude he saw at once that the discovery made no appreciable change
If he had been bound to silence before he was no less bound to it now the only difference lay in the fact that what he had just learned had rendered his bondage more intolerable
Hitherto he had felt for Sophy Viners defenseless state a sympathy profoundly tinged with compunction
But now he was halfconscious of an obscure indignation against her
Superior as he had fancied himself to readymade judgments he was aware of cherishing the common doubt as to the disinterestedness of the woman who tries to rise above her past
No wonder she had been sick with fear on meeting him
It was in his power to do her more harm than he had dreamed
Assuredly he did not want to harm her but he did desperately want to prevent her marrying Owen Leath
He tried to get away from the feeling to isolate and exteriorize it sufficiently to see what motives it was made of but it remained a mere blind motion of his blood the instinctive recoil from the thing that no amount of arguing can make straight
His tramp prolonged as it was carried him no nearer to enlightenment and after trudging through two or three sallow mudstained villages he turned about and wearily made his way back to Givre
As he walked up the black avenue making for the lights that twinkled through its pitching branches he had a sudden realisation of his utter helplessness
He might think and combine as he would but there was nothing absolutely nothing that he could do
He dropped his wet coat in the vestibule and began to mount the stairs to his room
But on the landing he was overtaken by a soberfaced maid who in tones discreetly lowered begged him to be so kind as to step for a moment into the Marquises sittingroom
Somewhat disconcerted by the summons he followed its bearer to the door at which a couple of hours earlier he had taken leave of Mrs Leath
It opened to admit him to a large lamplit room which he immediately perceived to be empty and the fact gave him time to note even through his disturbance of mind the interesting degree to which Madame de Chantelles apartment dated and completed her
Its looped and corded curtains its purple satin upholstery the Sevres jardinieres the rosewood firescreen the little velvet tables edged with lace and crowded with silver knickknacks and simpering miniatures reconstituted an almost perfect setting for the blonde beauty of the sixties
Darrow wondered that Fraser Leaths filial respect should have prevailed over his aesthetic scruples to the extent of permitting such an anachronism among the eighteenth century graces of Givre but a moments reflection made it clear that to its late owner the attitude would have seemed exactly in the traditions of the place
Madame de Chantelles emergence from an inner room snatched Darrow from these irrelevant musings
She was already beaded and bugled for the evening and save for a slight pinkness of the eyelids her elaborate appearance revealed no mark of agitation but Darrow noticed that in recognition of the solemnity of the occasion she pinched a lace handkerchief between her thumb and forefinger
She plunged at once into the centre of the difficulty appealing to him in the name of all the Everards to descend there with her to the rescue of her darling
She wasnt she was sure addressing herself in vain to one whose person whose tone whose traditions so brilliantly declared his indebtedness to the principles she besought him to defend
Her own reception of Darrow the confidence she had at once accorded him must have shown him that she had instinctively felt their unanimity of sentiment on these fundamental questions
She had in fact recognized in him the one person whom without pain to her maternal piety she could welcome as her sons successor and it was almost as to Owens father that she now appealed to Darrow to aid in rescuing the wretched boy
Dont think please that Im casting the least reflection on Anna or showing any want of sympathy for her when I say that I consider her partly responsible for whats happened
Anna is modernI believe thats what its called when you read unsettling books and admire hideous pictures
Indeed Madame de Chantelle continued leaning confidentially forward I myself have always more or less lived in that atmosphere my son you know was very revolutionary
Only he didnt of course apply his ideas they were purely intellectual
Thats what dear Anna has always failed to understand
And Im afraid shes created the same kind of confusion in Owens mindled him to mix up things you read about with things you doYou know of course that she sides with him in this wretched business
Developing at length upon this theme she finally narrowed down to the point of Darrows intervention
My grandson Mr Darrow calls me illogical and uncharitable because my feelings toward Miss Viner have changed since Ive heard this news
Well
Youve known her it appears for some years Anna tells me you used to see her when she was a companion or secretary or something to a dreadfully vulgar Mrs Murrett
And I ask you as a friend I ask you as one of US to tell me if you think a girl who has had to knock about the world in that kind of position and at the orders of all kinds of people is fitted to be Owens wife Im not implying anything against her
I LIKED the girl Mr
DarrowBut whats that got to do with it
I dont want her to marry my grandson
If Id been looking for a wife for Owen I shouldnt have applied to the Farlows to find me one
Thats what Anna wont understand and what you must help me to make her see
Darrow to this appeal could oppose only the repeated assurance of his inability to interfere
He tried to make Madame de Chantelle see that the very position he hoped to take in the household made his intervention the more hazardous
He brought up the usual arguments and sounded the expected note of sympathy but Madame de Chantelles alarm had dispelled her habitual imprecision and though she had not many reasons to advance her argument clung to its point like a frightened sharpclawed animal
Well then she summed up in response to his repeated assertions that he saw no way of helping her you can at least even if you wont say a word to the others tell me frankly and fairlyand quite between ourselvesyour personal opinion of Miss Viner since youve known her so much longer than we have
He protested that if he had known her longer he had known her much less well and that he had already on this point convinced Anna of his inability to pronounce an opinion
Madame de Chantelle drew a deep sigh of intelligence
Your opinion of Mrs Murrett is enough
I dont suppose you pretend to conceal THAT
And heaven knows what other unspeakable people shes been mixed up with
The only friends she can produce are called HokeDont try to reason with me Mr Darrow
There are feelings that go deeper than factsAnd I KNOW she thought of studying for the stage Madame de Chantelle raised the corner of her lace handkerchief to her eyes
Im oldfashionedlike my furniture she murmured
And I thought I could count on you Mr Darrow When Darrow that night regained his room he reflected with a flash of irony that each time he entered it he brought a fresh troop of perplexities to trouble its serene seclusion
Since the day after his arrival only forty eight hours before when he had set his window open to the night and his hopes had seemed as many as its stars each evening had brought its new problem and its renewed distress
But nothing as yet had approached the blank misery of mind with which he now set himself to face the fresh questions confronting him
Sophy Viner had not shown herself at dinner so that he had had no glimpse of her in her new character and no means of divining the real nature of the tie between herself and Owen Leath
One thing however was clear whatever her real feelings were and however much or little she had at stake if she had made up her mind to marry Owen she had more than enough skill and tenacity to defeat any arts that poor Madame de Chantelle could oppose to her
Darrow himself was in fact the only person who might possibly turn her from her purpose Madame de Chantelle at haphazard had hit on the surest means of saving Owenif to prevent his marriage were to save him
Darrow on this point did not pretend to any fixed opinion one feeling alone was clear and insistent in him he did not mean if he could help it to let the marriage take place
How he was to prevent it he did not know to his tormented imagination every issue seemed closed
For a fantastic instant he was moved to follow Madame de Chantelles suggestion and urge Anna to withdraw her approval
If his reticence his efforts to avoid the subject had not escaped her she had doubtless set them down to the fact of his knowing more and thinking less of Sophy Viner than he had been willing to admit and he might take advantage of this to turn her mind gradually from the project
Yet how do so without betraying his insincerity
If he had had nothing to hide he could easily have said Its one thing to know nothing against the girl its another to pretend that I think her a good match for Owen
But could he say even so much without betraying more
It was not Annas questions or his answers to them that he feared but what might cry aloud in the intervals between them
He understood now that ever since Sophy Viners arrival at Givre he had felt in Anna the lurking sense of something unexpressed and perhaps inexpressible between the girl and himselfWhen at last he fell asleep he had fatalistically committed his next step to the chances of the morrow
The first that offered itself was an encounter with Mrs Leath as he descended the stairs the next morning
She had come down already hatted and shod for a dash to the park lodge where one of the gatekeepers children had had an accident
In her compact dark dress she looked more than usually straight and slim and her face wore the pale glow it took on at any call on her energy a kind of warrior brightness that made her small head with its strong chin and closebound hair like that of an amazon in a frieze
It was their first moment alone since she had left him the afternoon before at her motherinlaws door and after a few words about the injured child their talk inevitably reverted to Owen
Anna spoke with a smile of her scene with Madame de Chantelle who belonged poor dear to a generation when scenes in the ladylike and lachrymal sense of the term were the tribute which sensibility was expected to pay to the unusual
Their conversation had been in every detail so exactly what Anna had foreseen that it had clearly not made much impression on her but she was eager to know the result of Darrows encounter with her motherinlaw
She told me shed sent for you she always sends for people in emergencies
That again I suppose is de lepoque
And failing Adelaide Painter who cant get here till this afternoon there was no one but poor you to turn to
She put it all lightly with a lightness that seemed to his tightstrung nerves slightly undefinably overdone
But he was so aware of his own tension that he wondered the next moment whether anything would ever again seem to him quite usual and insignificant and in the common order of things
As they hastened on through the drizzle in which the storm of the night was weeping itself out Anna drew close under his umbrella and at the pressure of her arm against his he recalled his walk up the Dover pier with Sophy Viner
The memory gave him a startled vision of the inevitable occasions of contact confidence familiarity which his future relationship to the girl would entail and the countless chances of betrayal that every one of them involved
Do tell me just what you said he heard Anna pleading and with sudden resolution he affirmed I quite understand your motherinlaws feeling as she does
The words when uttered seemed a good deal less significant than they had sounded to his inner ear and Anna replied without surprise Of course
Its inevitable that she should
But we shall bring her round in time
Under the dripping dome she raised her face to his
Dont you remember what you said the day before yesterday
Together we cant fail to pull it off for him
Ive told Owen that so youre pledged and theres no going back
The day before yesterday
Was it possible that no longer ago life had seemed a sufficiently simple business for a sane man to hazard such assurances
Anna he questioned her abruptly why are you so anxious for this marriage
She stopped short to face him
Why
But surely Ive explained to youor rather Ive hardly had to you seemed so in sympathy with my reasons
I didnt know then who it was that Owen wanted to marry
The words were out with a spring and he felt a clearer air in his brain
But her logic hemmed him in
You knew yesterday and you assured me then that you hadnt a word to say Against Miss Viner
The name once uttered sounded on and on in his ears
Of course not
But that doesnt necessarily imply that I think her a good match for Owen
Anna made no immediate answer
When she spoke it was to question Why dont you think her a good match for Owen
WellMadame de Chantelles reasons seem to me not quite as negligible as you think
You mean the fact that shes been Mrs Murretts secretary and that the people who employed her before were called Hoke
For as far as Owen and I can make out these are the gravest charges against her
Still one can understand that the match is not what Madame de Chantelle had dreamed of
Oh perfectlyif thats all you mean
The lodge was in sight and she hastened her step
He strode on beside her in silence but at the gate she checked him with the question Is it really all you mean
Of course he heard himself declare
Oh then I think I shall convince youeven if I cant like Madame de Chantelle summon all the Everards to my aid
She lifted to him the look of happy laughter that sometimes brushed her with a gleam of spring
Darrow watched her hasten along the path between the dripping chrysanthemums and enter the lodge
After she had gone in he paced up and down outside in the drizzle waiting to learn if she had any message to send back to the house and after the lapse of a few minutes she came out again
The child she said was badly though not dangerously hurt and the village doctor who was already on hand had asked that the surgeon already summoned from Francheuil should be told to bring with him certain needful appliances
Owen had started by motor to fetch the surgeon but there was still time to communicate with the latter by telephone
The doctor furthermore begged for an immediate provision of such bandages and disinfectants as Givre itself could furnish and Anna bade Darrow address himself to Miss Viner who would know where to find the necessary things and would direct one of the servants to bicycle with them to the lodge
Darrow as he hurried off on this errand had at once perceived the opportunity it offered of a word with Sophy Viner
What that word was to be he did not know but now if ever was the moment to make it urgent and conclusive
It was unlikely that he would again have such a chance of unobserved talk with her
He had supposed he should find her with her pupil in the schoolroom but he learned from a servant that Effie had gone to Francheuil with her stepbrother and that Miss Viner was still in her room
Darrow sent her word that he was the bearer of a message from the lodge and a moment later he heard her coming down the stairs
XX For a second as she approached him the quick tremor of her glance showed her all intent on the same thought as himself
He transmitted his instructions with mechanical precision and she answered in the same tone repeating his words with the intensity of attention of a child not quite sure of understanding
Then she disappeared up the stairs
Darrow lingered on in the hall not knowing if she meant to return yet inwardly sure she would
At length he saw her coming down in her hat and jacket
The rain still streaked the window panes and in order to say something he said Youre not going to the lodge yourself
Ive sent one of the men ahead with the things but I thought Mrs Leath might need me
She didnt ask for you he returned wondering how he could detain her but she answered decidedly Id better go
He held open the door picked up his umbrella and followed her out
As they went down the steps she glanced back at him
Youve forgotten your mackintosh
I shant need it
She had no umbrella and he opened his and held it out to her
She rejected it with a murmur of thanks and walked on through the thin drizzle and he kept the umbrella over his own head without offering to shelter her
Rapidly and in silence they crossed the court and began to walk down the avenue
They had traversed a third of its length before Darrow said abruptly Wouldnt it have been fairer when we talked together yesterday to tell me what Ive just heard from Mrs
Leath
Fairer
She stopped short with a startled look
If Id known that your future was already settled I should have spared you my gratuitous suggestions
She walked on more slowly for a yard or two
I couldnt speak yesterday
I meant to have told you today
Oh Im not reproaching you for your lack of confidence
Only if you HAD told me I should have been more sure of your really meaning what you said to me yesterday
She did not ask him to what he referred and he saw that her parting words to him lived as vividly in her memory as in his
Is it so important that you should be sure
she finally questioned
Not to you naturally he returned with involuntary asperity
It was incredible yet it was a fact that for the moment his immediate purpose in seeking to speak to her was lost under a rush of resentment at counting for so little in her fate
Of what stuff then was his feeling for her made
A few hours earlier she had touched his thoughts as little as his senses but now he felt old sleeping instincts stir in him A rush of rain dashed against his face and catching Sophys hat strained it back from her loosened hair
She put her hands to her head with a familiar gestureHe came closer and held his umbrella over her At the lodge he waited while she went in
The rain continued to stream down on him and he shivered in the dampness and stamped his feet on the flags
It seemed to him that a long time elapsed before the door opened and she reappeared
He glanced into the house for a glimpse of Anna but obtained none yet the mere sense of her nearness had completely altered his mood
The child Sophy told him was doing well but Mrs Leath had decided to wait till the surgeon came
Darrow as they turned away looked through the gates and saw the doctors oldfashioned carriage by the roadside
Let me tell the doctors boy to drive you back he suggested but Sophy answered No Ill walk and he moved on toward the house at her side
She expressed no surprise at his not remaining at the lodge and again they walked on in silence through the rain
She had accepted the shelter of his umbrella but she kept herself at such a carefully measured distance that even the slight swaying movements produced by their quick pace did not once bring her arm in touch with his and noticing this he perceived that every drop of her blood must be alive to his nearness
What I meant just now he began was that you ought to have been sure of my good wishes
She seemed to weigh the words
Sure enough for what
To trust me a little farther than you did
Ive told you that yesterday I wasnt free to speak
Well since you are now may I say a word to you
She paused perceptibly and when she spoke it was in so low a tone that he had to bend his head to catch her answer
I cant think what you can have to say
Its not easy to say here at any rate
And indoors I shant know where to say it
He glanced about him in the rain
Lets walk over to the springhouse for a minute
To the right of the drive under a clump of trees a little stucco pavilion crowned by a balustrade rose on arches of mouldering brick over a flight of steps that led down to a spring
Other steps curved up to a door above
Darrow mounted these and opening the door entered a small circular room hung with loosened strips of painted paper whereon spectrally faded Mandarins executed elongated gestures
Some black and gold chairs with straw seats and an unsteady table of cracked lacquer stood on the floor of redglazed tile
Sophy had followed him without comment
He closed the door after her and she stood motionless as though waiting for him to speak
Now we can talk quietly he said looking at her with a smile into which he tried to put an intention of the frankest friendliness
She merely repeated I cant think what you can have to say
Her voice had lost the note of halfwistful confidence on which their talk of the previous day had closed and she looked at him with a kind of pale hostility
Her tone made it evident that his task would be difficult but it did not shake his resolve to go on
He sat down and mechanically she followed his example
The table was between them and she rested her arms on its cracked edge and her chin on her interlocked hands
He looked at her and she gave him back his look
Have you nothing to say to ME
he asked at length
A faint smile lifted in the remembered way the left corner of her narrowed lips
About my marriage
About your marriage
She continued to consider him between halfdrawn lids
What can I say that Mrs Leath has not already told you
Mrs Leath has told me nothing whatever but the factand her pleasure in it
Well arent those the two essential points
The essential points to YOU
I should have thought Oh to YOU I meant she put in keenly
He flushed at the retort but steadied himself and rejoined The essential point to me is of course that you should be doing whats really best for you
She sat silent with lowered lashes
At length she stretched out her arm and took up from the table a little threadbare Chinese handscreen
She turned its ebony stem once or twice between her fingers and as she did so Darrow was whimsically struck by the way in which their evanescent slight romance was symbolized by the fading lines on the frail silk
Do you think my engagement to Mr Leath not really best for me
she asked at length
Darrow before answering waited long enough to get his words into the tersest shapenot without a sense as he did so of his likeness to the surgeon deliberately poising his lancet for a clean incision
Im not sure he replied of its being the best thing for either of you
She took the stroke steadily but a faint red swept her face like the reflection of a blush
She continued to keep her lowered eyes on the screen
From whose point of view do you speak
Naturally that of the persons most concerned
From Owens then of course
You dont think me a good match for him
From yours first of all
I dont think him a good match for you
He brought the answer out abruptly his eyes on her face
It had grown extremely pale but as the meaning of his words shaped itself in her mind he saw a curious inner light dawn through her set look
She lifted her lids just far enough for a veiled glance at him and a smile slipped through them to her trembling lips
For a moment the change merely bewildered him then it pulled him up with a sharp jerk of apprehension
I dont think him a good match for you he stammered groping for the lost thread of his words
She threw a vague look about the chilly raindimmed room
And youve brought me here to tell me why
The question roused him to the sense that their minutes were numbered and that if he did not immediately get to his point there might be no other chance of making it
My chief reason is that I believe hes too young and inexperienced to give you the kind of support you need
At his words her face changed again freezing to a tragic coldness
She stared straight ahead of her perceptibly struggling with the tremor of her muscles and when she had controlled it she flung out a palelipped pleasantry
But you see Ive always had to support myself
Hes a boy Darrow pushed on a charming wonderful boy but with no more notion than a boy how to deal with the inevitable daily problemsthe trivial stupid unimportant things that life is chiefly made up of
Ill deal with them for him she rejoined
Theyll be more than ordinarily difficult
She shot a challenging glance at him
You must have some special reason for saying so
Only my clear perception of the facts
What facts do you mean
Darrow hesitated
You must know better than I he returned at length that the way wont be made easy to you
Mrs Leath at any rate has made it so
Madame de Chantelle will not
How do YOU know that
she flung back
He paused again not sure how far it was prudent to reveal himself in the confidence of the household
Then to avoid involving Anna he answered Madame de Chantelle sent for me yesterday
Sent for youto talk to you about me
The colour rose to her forehead and her eyes burned black under lowered brows
By what right I should like to know
What have you to do with me or with anything in the world that concerns me
Darrow instantly perceived what dread suspicion again possessed her and the sense that it was not wholly unjustified caused him a passing pang of shame
But it did not turn him from his purpose
Im an old friend of Mrs Leaths
Its not unnatural that Madame de Chantelle should talk to me
She dropped the screen on the table and stood up turning on him the same small mask of wrath and scorn which had glared at him in Paris when he had confessed to his suppression of her letter
She walked away a step or two and then came back
May I ask what Madame de Chantelle said to you
She made it clear that she should not encourage the marriage
And what was her object in making that clear to YOU
Darrow hesitated
I suppose she thought That she could persuade you to turn Mrs Leath against me
He was silent and she pressed him Was that it
That was it
But if you dontif you keep your promise My promise
To say nothingnothing whatever Her strained look threw a haggard light along the pause
As she spoke the whole odiousness of the scene rushed over him
Of course I shall say nothingyou know that He leaned to her and laid his hand on hers
You know I wouldnt for the world She drew back and hid her face with a sob
Then she sank again into her seat stretched her arms across the table and laid her face upon them
He sat still overwhelmed with compunction
After a long interval in which he had painfully measured the seconds by her harddrawn breathing she looked up at him with a face washed clear of bitterness
Dont suppose I dont know what you must have thought of me
The cry struck him down to a lower depth of selfabasement
My poor child he felt like answering the shame of it is that Ive never thought of you at all
But he could only uselessly repeat Ill do anything I can to help you
She sat silent drumming the table with her hand
He saw that her doubt of him was allayed and the perception made him more ashamed as if her trust had first revealed to him how near he had come to not deserving it
Suddenly she began to speak
You think then Ive no right to marry him
No right
God forbid
I only meant That youd rather I didnt marry any friend of yours
She brought it out deliberately not as a question but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact
Darrow in turn stood up and wandered away helplessly to the window
He stood staring out through its small discoloured panes at the dim brown distances then he moved back to the table
Ill tell you exactly what I meant
Youll be wretched if you marry a man youre not in love with
He knew the risk of misapprehension that he ran but he estimated his chances of success as precisely in proportion to his peril
If certain signs meant what he thought they did he might yetat what cost he would not stop to think make his past pay for his future
The girl at his words had lifted her head with a movement of surprise
Her eyes slowly reached his face and rested there in a gaze of deep interrogation
He held the look for a moment then his own eyes dropped and he waited
At length she began to speak
Youre mistakenyoure quite mistaken
He waited a moment longer
Mistaken
In thinking what you think
Im as happy as if I deserved it
she suddenly proclaimed with a laugh
She stood up and moved toward the door
NOW are you satisfied
she asked turning her vividest face to him from the threshold
XXI Down the avenue there came to them with the opening of the door the voice of Owens motor
It was the signal which had interrupted their first talk and again instinctively they drew apart at the sound
Without a word Darrow turned back into the room while Sophy Viner went down the steps and walked back alone toward the court
At luncheon the presence of the surgeon and the non appearance of Madame de Chantellewho had excused herself on the plea of a headachecombined to shift the conversational centre of gravity and Darrow under shelter of the necessarily impersonal talk had time to adjust his disguise and to perceive that the others were engaged in the same rearrangement
It was the first time that he had seen young Leath and Sophy Viner together since he had learned of their engagement but neither revealed more emotion than befitted the occasion
It was evident that Owen was deeply under the girls charm and that at the least sign from her his bliss would have broken bounds but her reticence was justified by the tacitly recognized fact of Madame de Chantelles disapproval
This also visibly weighed on Annas mind making her manner to Sophy if no less kind yet a trifle more constrained than if the moment of final understanding had been reached
So Darrow interpreted the tension perceptible under the fluent exchange of commonplaces in which he was diligently sharing
But he was more and more aware of his inability to test the moral atmosphere about him he was like a man in fever testing anothers temperature by the touch
After luncheon Anna who was to motor the surgeon home suggested to Darrow that he should accompany them
Effie was also of the party and Darrow inferred that Anna wished to give her stepson a chance to be alone with his betrothed
On the way back after the surgeon had been left at his door the little girl sat between her mother and Darrow and her presence kept their talk from taking a personal turn
Darrow knew that Mrs Leath had not yet told Effie of the relation in which he was to stand to her
The premature divulging of Owens plans had thrown their own into the background and by common consent they continued in the little girls presence on terms of an informal friendliness
The sky had cleared after luncheon and to prolong their excursion they returned by way of the ivymantled ruin which was to have been the scene of the projected picnic
This circuit brought them back to the park gates not long before sunset and as Anna wished to stop at the lodge for news of the injured child Darrow left her there with Effie and walked on alone to the house
He had the impression that she was slightly surprised at his not waiting for her but his inner restlessness vented itself in an intense desire for bodily movement
He would have liked to walk himself into a state of torpor to tramp on for hours through the moist winds and the healing darkness and come back staggering with fatigue and sleep
But he had no pretext for such a flight and he feared that at such a moment his prolonged absence might seem singular to Anna
As he approached the house the thought of her nearness produced a swift reaction of mood
It was as if an intenser vision of her had scattered his perplexities like morning mists
At this moment wherever she was he knew he was safely shut away in her thoughts and the knowledge made every other fact dwindle away to a shadow
He and she loved each other and their love arched over them open and ample as the day in all its sunlit spaces there was no cranny for a fear to lurk
In a few minutes he would be in her presence and would read his reassurance in her eyes
And presently before dinner she would contrive that they should have an hour by themselves in her sittingroom and he would sit by the hearth and watch her quiet movements and the way the bluish lustre on her hair purpled a little as she bent above the fire
A carriage drove out of the court as he entered it and in the hall his vision was dispelled by the exceedingly substantial presence of a lady in a waterproof and a tweed hat who stood firmly planted in the centre of a pile of luggage as to which she was giving involved but lucid directions to the footman who had just admitted her
She went on with these directions regardless of Darrows entrance merely fixing her small pale eyes on him while she proceeded in a deep contralto voice and a fluent French pronounced with the purest Boston accent to specify the destination of her bags and this enabled Darrow to give her back a gaze protracted enough to take in all the details of her plain thickset person from the square sallow face beneath bands of grey hair to the blunt boottoes protruding under her wide walking skirt
She submitted to this scrutiny with no more evidence of surprise than a monument examined by a tourist but when the fate of her luggage had been settled she turned suddenly to Darrow and dropping her eyes from his face to his feet asked in trenchant accents What sort of boots have you got on
Before he could summon his wits to the consideration of this question she continued in a tone of suppressed indignation Until Americans get used to the fact that France is under water for half the year theyre perpetually risking their lives by not being properly protected
I suppose youve been tramping through all this nasty clammy mud as if youd been taking a stroll on Boston Common
Darrow with a laugh affirmed his previous experience of French dampness and the degree to which he was on his guard against it but the lady with a contemptuous snort rejoined You young men are all alike to which she appended after another hard look at him I suppose youre George Darrow
I used to know one of your mothers cousins who married a Tunstall of Mount Vernon Street
My name is Adelaide Painter
Have you been in Boston lately
No
Im sorry for that
I hear there have been several new houses built at the lower end of Commonwealth Avenue and I hoped you could tell me about them
I havent been there for thirty years myself
Miss Painters arrival at Givre produced the same effect as the winds hauling around to the north after days of languid weather
When Darrow joined the group about the teatable she had already given a tingle to the air
Madame de Chantelle still remained invisible above stairs but Darrow had the impression that even through her drawn curtains and bolted doors a stimulating whiff must have entered
Anna was in her usual seat behind the teatray and Sophy Viner presently led in her pupil
Owen was also there seated as usual a little apart from the others and following Miss Painters massive movements and equally substantial utterances with a smile of secret intelligence which gave Darrow the idea of his having been in clandestine parley with the enemy
Darrow further took note that the girl and her suitor perceptibly avoided each other but this might be a natural result of the tension Miss Painter had been summoned to relieve
Sophy Viner would evidently permit no recognition of the situation save that which it lay with Madame de Chantelle to accord but meanwhile Miss Painter had proclaimed her tacit sense of it by summoning the girl to a seat at her side
Darrow as he continued to observe the newcomer who was perched on her armchair like a granite image on the edge of a cliff was aware that in a more detached frame of mind he would have found an extreme interest in studying and classifying Miss Painter
It was not that she said anything remarkable or betrayed any of those unspoken perceptions which give significance to the most commonplace utterances
She talked of the lateness of her train of an impending crisis in international politics of the difficulty of buying English tea in Paris and of the enormities of which French servants were capable and her views on these subjects were enunciated with a uniformity of emphasis implying complete unconsciousness of any difference in their interest and importance
She always applied to the French race the distant epithet of those people but she betrayed an intimate acquaintance with many of its members and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the domestic habits financial difficulties and private complications of various persons of social importance
Yet as she evidently felt no incongruity in her attitude so she revealed no desire to parade her familiarity with the fashionable or indeed any sense of it as a fact to be paraded
It was evident that the titled ladies whom she spoke of as Mimi or Simone or Odette were as much those people to her as the bonne who tampered with her tea and steamed the stamps off her letters when by a miracle I dont put them in the box myself
Her whole attitude was of a vast grim tolerance of thingsastheycame as though she had been some wonderful automatic machine which recorded facts but had not yet been perfected to the point of sorting or labelling them
All this as Darrow was aware still fell short of accounting for the influence she obviously exerted on the persons in contact with her
It brought a slight relief to his state of tension to go on wondering while he watched and listened just where the mystery lurked
Perhaps after all it was in the fact of her blank insensibility an insensibility so devoid of egotism that it had no hardness and no grimaces but rather the freshness of a simpler mental state
After living as he had as they all had for the last few days in an atmosphere perpetually tremulous with echoes and implications it was restful and fortifying merely to walk into the big blank area of Miss Painters mind so vacuous for all its accumulated items so echoless for all its vacuity
His hope of a word with Anna before dinner was dispelled by her rising to take Miss Painter up to Madame de Chantelle and he wandered away to his own room leaving Owen and Miss Viner engaged in working out a picturepuzzle for Effie
Madame de Chantellepossibly as the result of her friends ministrationswas able to appear at the dinnertable rather pale and pinknosed and casting tenderly reproachful glances at her grandson who faced them with impervious serenity and the situation was relieved by the fact that Miss Viner as usual had remained in the schoolroom with her pupil
Darrow conjectured that the real clash of arms would not take place till the morrow and wishing to leave the field open to the contestants he set out early on a solitary walk
It was nearly luncheontime when he returned from it and came upon Anna just emerging from the house
She had on her hat and jacket and was apparently coming forth to seek him for she said at once Madame de Chantelle wants you to go up to her
To go up to her
Now
Thats the message she sent
She appears to rely on you to do something
She added with a smile Whatever it is lets have it over
Darrow through his rising sense of apprehension wondered why instead of merely going for a walk he had not jumped into the first train and got out of the way till Owens affairs were finally settled
But what in the name of goodness can I do
he protested following Anna back into the hall
I dont know
But Owen seems so to rely on you too Owen
Is HE to be there
No
But you know I told him he could count on you
But Ive said to your motherinlaw all I could
Well then you can only repeat it
This did not seem to Darrow to simplify his case as much as she appeared to think and once more he had a movement of recoil
Theres no possible reason for my being mixed up in this affair
Anna gave him a reproachful glance
Not the fact that I am
she reminded him but even this only stiffened his resistance
Why should you be eitherto this extent
The question made her pause
She glanced about the hall as if to be sure they had it to themselves and then in a lowered voice I dont know she suddenly confessed but somehow if THEYRE not happy I feel as if we shouldnt be
Oh well Darrow acquiesced in the tone of the man who perforce yields to so lovely an unreasonableness
Escape was after all impossible and he could only resign himself to being led to Madame de Chantelles door
Within among the bricabrac and furbelows he found Miss Painter seated in a redundant purple armchair with the incongruous air of a horseman bestriding a heavy mount
Madame de Chantelle sat opposite still a little wan and disordered under her elaborate hair and clasping the handkerchief whose visibility symbolized her distress
On the young mans entrance she sighed out a plaintive welcome to which she immediately appended Mr Darrow I cant help feeling that at heart youre with me
The directness of the challenge made it easier for Darrow to protest and he reiterated his inability to give an opinion on either side
But Anna declares you haveon hers
He could not restrain a smile at this faint flaw in an impartiality so scrupulous
Every evidence of feminine inconsequence in Anna seemed to attest her deeper subjection to the most inconsequent of passions
He had certainly promised her his helpbut before he knew what he was promising
He met Madame de Chantelles appeal by replying If there were anything I could possibly say I should want it to be in Miss Viners favour
Youd want it to beyes
But could you make it so
As far as facts go I dont see how I can make it either for or against her
Ive already said that I know nothing of her except that shes charming
As if that werent enoughwerent all there OUGHT to be
Miss Painter put in impatiently
She seemed to address herself to Darrow though her small eyes were fixed on her friend
Madame de Chantelle seems to imagine she pursued that a young American girl ought to have a dossiera police record or whatever you call it what those awful women in the streets have here
In our country its enough to know that a young girls pure and lovely people dont immediately ask her to show her bankaccount and her visitinglist
Madame de Chantelle looked plaintively at her sturdy monitress
You dont expect me not to ask if shes got a family
No nor to think the worse of her if she hasnt
The fact that shes an orphan ought with your ideas to be a merit
You wont have to invite her father and mother to Givre
AdelaideAdelaide
the mistress of Givre lamented
Lucretia Mary the other returnedand Darrow spared an instants amusement to the quaint incongruity of the name you know you sent for Mr Darrow to refute me and how can he till he knows what I think
You think its perfectly simple to let Owen marry a girl we know nothing about
No but I dont think its perfectly simple to prevent him
The shrewdness of the answer increased Darrows interest in Miss Painter
She had not hitherto struck him as being a person of much penetration but he now felt sure that her gimlet gaze might bore to the heart of any practical problem
Madame de Chantelle sighed out her recognition of the difficulty
I havent a word to say against Miss Viner but shes knocked about so as its called that she must have been mixed up with some rather dreadful people
If only Owen could be made to see thatif one could get at a few facts I mean
She says for instance that she has a sister but it seems she doesnt even know her address
If she does she may not want to give it to you
I daresay the sisters one of the dreadful people
Ive no doubt that with a little time you could rake up dozens of them have her traced as they call it in detective stories
I dont think youd frighten Owen but you might its natural enough he should have been corrupted by those foreign ideas
You might even manage to part him from the girl but you couldnt keep him from being in love with her
I saw that when I looked them over last evening
I said to myself Its a real oldfashioned American case as sweet and sound as homemade bread
Well if you take his loaf away from him what are you going to feed him with instead
Which of your nasty Paris poisons do you think hell turn to
Supposing you succeed in keeping him out of a really bad messand knowing the young man as I do I rather think that at this crisis the only way to do it would be to marry him slap off to somebody elsewell then who may I ask would you pick out
One of your sweet French ingenues I suppose
With as much mind as a minnow and as much snap as a softboiled egg
You might hustle him into that kind of marriage I daresay you couldbut if I know Owen the natural thing would happen before the first baby was weaned
I dont know why you insinuate such odious things against Owen
Do you think it would be odious of him to return to his real love when hed been forcibly parted from her
At any rate its what your French friends do every one of them
Only they dont generally have the grace to go back to an old love and I believe upon my word Owen would
Madame de Chantelle looked at her with a mixture of awe and exultation
Of course you realize Adelaide that in suggesting this youre insinuating the most shocking things against Miss Viner
When I say that if you part two young things who are dying to be happy in the lawful way its ten to one theyll come together in an unlawful one
Im insinuating shocking things against YOU Lucretia Mary in suggesting for a moment that youll care to assume such a responsibility before your Maker
And you wouldnt if you talked things straight out with him instead of merely sending him messages through a miserable sinner like yourself
Darrow expected this assault on her adopted creed to provoke in Madame de Chantelle an explosion of pious indignation but to his surprise she merely murmured I dont know what Mr Darrowll think of you
Mr Darrow probably knows his Bible as well as I do Miss Painter calmly rejoined adding a moment later without the least perceptible change of voice or expression I suppose youve heard that Gisele de Folembrays husband accuses her of being mixed up with the Duc dArcachon in that business of trying to sell a lot of imitation pearls to Mrs Homer Pond the Chicago woman the Dukes engaged to
It seems the jeweller says Gisele brought Mrs Pond there and got twentyfive per centwhich of course she passed on to dArcachon
The poor old Duchess is in a fearful stateso afraid her sonll lose Mrs Pond
When I think that Gisele is old Bradford Wagstaffs granddaughter Im thankful hes safe in Mount Auburn
XXII It was not until late that afternoon that Darrow could claim his postponed hour with Anna
When at last he found her alone in her sittingroom it was with a sense of liberation so great that he sought no logical justification of it
He simply felt that all their destinies were in Miss Painters grasp and that resistance being useless he could only enjoy the sweets of surrender
Anna herself seemed as happy and for more explicable reasons
She had assisted after luncheon at another debate between Madame de Chantelle and her confidant and had surmised when she withdrew from it that victory was permanently perched on Miss Painters banners
I dont know how she does it unless its by the dead weight of her convictions
She detests the French so that shed back up Owen even if she knew nothingor knew too muchof Miss Viner
She somehow regards the match as a protest against the corruption of European morals
I told Owen that was his great chance and hes made the most of it
What a tactician you are
You make me feel that I hardly know the rudiments of diplomacy Darrow smiled at her abandoning himself to a perilous sense of wellbeing
She gave him back his smile
Im afraid I think nothing short of my own happiness is worth wasting any diplomacy on
Thats why I mean to resign from the service of my country he rejoined with a laugh of deep content
The feeling that both resistance and apprehension were vain was working like wine in his veins
He had done what he could to deflect the course of events now he could only stand aside and take his chance of safety
Underneath this fatalistic feeling was the deep sense of relief that he had after all said and done nothing that could in the least degree affect the welfare of Sophy Viner
That fact took a millstone off his neck
Meanwhile he gave himself up once more to the joy of Annas presence
They had not been alone together for two long days and he had the lovers sense that he had forgotten or at least underestimated the strength of the spell she cast
Once more her eyes and her smile seemed to bound his world
He felt that their light would always move with him as the sunset moves before a ship at sea
The next day his sense of security was increased by a decisive incident
It became known to the expectant household that Madame de Chantelle had yielded to the tremendous impact of Miss Painters determination and that Sophy Viner had been sent for to the purple satin sitting room
At luncheon Owens radiant countenance proclaimed the happy sequel and Darrow when the party had moved back to the oakroom for coffee deemed it discreet to wander out alone to the terrace with his cigar
The conclusion of Owens romance brought his own plans once more to the front
Anna had promised that she would consider dates and settle details as soon as Madame de Chantelle and her grandson had been reconciled and Darrow was eager to go into the question at once since it was necessary that the preparations for his marriage should go forward as rapidly as possible
Anna he knew would not seek any farther pretext for delay and he strolled up and down contentedly in the sunshine certain that she would come out and reassure him as soon as the reunited family had claimed its due share of her attention
But when she finally joined him her first word was for the younger lovers
I want to thank you for what youve done for Owen she began with her happiest smile
WhoI
he laughed
Are you confusing me with Miss Painter
Perhaps I ought to say for ME she corrected herself
Youve been even more of a help to us than Adelaide
My dear child
What on earth have I done
Youve managed to hide from Madame de Chantelle that you dont really like poor Sophy
Darrow felt the pallour in his cheek
Not like her
What put such an idea into your head
Oh its more than an ideaits a feeling
But what difference does it make after all
You saw her in such a different setting that its natural you should be a little doubtful
But when you know her better Im sure youll feel about her as I do
Its going to be hard for me not to feel about everything as you do
Well thenplease begin with my daughterinlaw
He gave her back in the same tone of banter Agreed if you ll agree to feel as I do about the pressing necessity of our getting married
I want to talk to you about that too
You dont know what a weight is off my mind
With Sophy here for good I shall feel so differently about leaving Effie
Ive seen much more accomplished governessesto my costbut Ive never seen a young thing more gay and kind and human
You must have noticed though youve seen them so little together how Effie expands when shes with her
And that you know is what I want
Madame de Chantelle will provide the necessary restraint
She clasped her hands on his arm
Yes Im ready to go with you now
But first of allthis very momentyou must come with me to Effie
She knows of course nothing of whats been happening and I want her to be told first about YOU
Effie sought throughout the house was presently traced to the schoolroom and thither Darrow mounted with Anna
He had never seen her so alight with happiness and he had caught her buoyancy of mood
He kept repeating to himself Its overits over as if some monstrous midnight hallucination had been routed by the return of day
As they approached the schoolroom door the terriers barks came to them through laughing remonstrances
Shes giving him his dinner Anna whispered her hand in Darrows
Dont forget the goldfish
they heard another voice call out
Darrow halted on the threshold
Ohnot now
Not now
I meanshed rather have you tell her first
Ill wait for you both downstairs
He was aware that she glanced at him intently
As you please
Ill bring her down at once
She opened the door and as she went in he heard her say No Sophy dont go
I want you both
The rest of Darrows day was a succession of empty and agitating scenes
On his way down to Givre before he had seen Effie Leath he had pictured somewhat sentimentally the joy of the moment when he should take her in his arms and receive her first filial kiss
Everything in him that egotistically craved for rest stability a comfortably organized middleage all the homebuilding instincts of the man who has sufficiently wooed and wandered combined to throw a charm about the figure of the child who mightwho shouldhave been his
Effie came to him trailing the cloud of glory of his first romance giving him back the magic hour he had missed and mourned
And how different the realization of his dream had been
The childs radiant welcome her unquestioning acceptance of this new figure in the family group had been all that he had hoped and fancied
If Mother was so awfully happy about it and Owen and Granny too how nice and cosy and comfortable it was going to be for all of them her beaming look seemed to say and then suddenly the small pink fingers he had been kissing were laid on the one flaw in the circle on the one point which must be settled before Effie could with complete unqualified assurance admit the newcomer to full equality with the other gods of her Olympus
And is Sophy awfully happy about it too
she had asked loosening her hold on Darrows neck to tilt back her head and include her mother in her questioning look
Why dearest didnt you see she was
Anna had exclaimed leaning to the group with radiant eyes
I think I should like to ask her the child rejoined after a minutes shy consideration and as Darrow set her down her mother laughed Do darling do
Run off at once and tell her we expect her to be awfully happy too
The scene had been succeeded by others less poignant but almost as trying
Darrow cursed his luck in having at such a moment to run the gauntlet of a houseful of interested observers
The state of being engaged in itself an absurd enough predicament even to a man only intermittently exposed became intolerable under the continuous scrutiny of a small circle quivering with participation
Darrow was furthermore aware that though the case of the other couple ought to have made his own less conspicuous it was rather they who found a refuge in the shadow of his prominence
Madame de Chantelle though she had consented to Owens engagement and formally welcomed his betrothed was nevertheless not sorry to show by her reception of Darrow of what finelyshaded degrees of cordiality she was capable
Miss Painter having won the day for Owen was also free to turn her attention to the newer candidate for her sympathy and Darrow and Anna found themselves immersed in a warm bath of sentimental curiosity
It was a relief to Darrow that he was under a positive obligation to end his visit within the next fortyeight hours
When he left London his Ambassador had accorded him a ten days leave
His fate being definitely settled and openly published he had no reason for asking to have the time prolonged and when it was over he was to return to his post till the time fixed for taking up his new duties
Anna and he had therefore decided to be married in Paris a day or two before the departure of the steamer which was to take them to South America and Anna shortly after his return to England was to go up to Paris and begin her own preparations
In honour of the double betrothal Effie and Miss Viner were to appear that evening at dinner and Darrow on leaving his room met the little girl springing down the stairs her white ruffles and coralcoloured bows making her look like a daisy with her yellow hair for its centre
Sophy Viner was behind her pupil and as she came into the light Darrow noticed a change in her appearance and wondered vaguely why she looked suddenly younger more vivid more like the little luminous ghost of his Paris memories
Then it occurred to him that it was the first time she had appeared at dinner since his arrival at Givre and the first time consequently that he had seen her in evening dress
She was still at the age when the least adornment embellishes and no doubt the mere uncovering of her young throat and neck had given her back her former brightness
But a second glance showed a more precise reason for his impression
Vaguely though he retained such details he felt sure she was wearing the dress he had seen her in every evening in Paris
It was a simple enough dress black and transparent on the arms and shoulders and he would probably not have recognized it if she had not called his attention to it in Paris by confessing that she hadnt any other
The same dress
That proves that shes forgotten
was his first halfironic thought but the next moment with a pang of compunction he said to himself that she had probably put it on for the same reason as before simply because she hadnt any other
He looked at her in silence and for an instant above Effies bobbing head she gave him back his look in a full bright gaze
Oh theres Owen
Effie cried and whirled away down the gallery to the door from which her stepbrother was emerging
As Owen bent to catch her Sophy Viner turned abruptly back to Darrow
You too
she said with a quick laugh
I didnt know  And as Owen came up to them she added in a tone that might have been meant to reach his ear I wish you all the luck that we can spare
About the dinnertable which Effie with Miss Viners aid had lavishly garlanded the little party had an air of somewhat selfconscious festivity
In spite of flowers champagne and a unanimous attempt at ease there were frequent lapses in the talk and moments of nervous groping for new subjects
Miss Painter alone seemed not only unaffected by the general perturbation but as tightly sealed up in her unconsciousness of it as a diver in his bell
To Darrows strained attention even Owens gusts of gaiety seemed to betray an inward sense of insecurity
After dinner however at the piano he broke into a mood of extravagant hilarity and flooded the room with the splash and ripple of his music
Darrow sunk in a sofa corner in the lee of Miss Painters granite bulk smoked and listened in silence his eyes moving from one figure to another
Madame de Chantelle in her armchair near the fire clasped her little granddaughter to her with the gesture of a drawingroom Niobe and Anna seated near them had fallen into one of the attitudes of vivid calm which seemed to Darrow to express her inmost quality
Sophy Viner after moving uncertainly about the room had placed herself beyond Mrs Leath in a chair near the piano where she sat with head thrown back and eyes attached to the musician in the same rapt fixity of attention with which she had followed the players at the Francais
The accident of her having fallen into the same attitude and of her wearing the same dress gave Darrow as he watched her a strange sense of double consciousness
To escape from it his glance turned back to Anna but from the point at which he was placed his eyes could not take in the one face without the other and that renewed the disturbing duality of the impression
Suddenly Owen broke off with a crash of chords and jumped to his feet
Whats the use of this with such a moon to say it for us
Behind the uncurtained window a low golden orb hung like a ripe fruit against the glass
Yeslets go out and listen Anna answered
Owen threw open the window and with his gesture a fold of the heavy starsprinkled sky seemed to droop into the room like a drawnin curtain
The air that entered with it had a frosty edge and Anna bade Effie run to the hall for wraps
Darrow said You must have one too and started toward the door but Sophy following her pupil cried back Well bring things for everybody
Owen had followed her and in a moment the three reappeared and the party went out on the terrace
The deep blue purity of the night was unveiled by mist and the moonlight rimmed the edges of the trees with a silver blur and blanched to unnatural whiteness the statues against their walls of shade
Darrow and Anna with Effie between them strolled to the farther corner of the terrace
Below them between the fringes of the park the lawn sloped dimly to the fields above the river
For a few minutes they stood silently side by side touched to peace beneath the trembling beauty of the sky
When they turned back Darrow saw that Owen and Sophy Viner who had gone down the steps to the garden were also walking in the direction of the house
As they advanced Sophy paused in a patch of moonlight between the sharp shadows of the yews and Darrow noticed that she had thrown over her shoulders a long cloak of some light colour which suddenly evoked her image as she had entered the restaurant at his side on the night of their first dinner in Paris
A moment later they were all together again on the terrace and when they reentered the drawingroom the older ladies were on their way to bed
Effie emboldened by the privileges of the evening was for coaxing Owen to round it off with a game of forfeits or some such reckless climax but Sophy resuming her professional role sounded the summons to bed
In her pupils wake she made her round of goodnights but when she proffered her hand to Anna the latter ignoring the gesture held out both arms
Goodnight dear child she said impulsively and drew the girl to her kiss
BOOK IV XXIII The next day was Darrows last at Givre and foreseeing that the afternoon and evening would have to be given to the family he had asked Anna to devote an early hour to the final consideration of their plans
He was to meet her in the brown sittingroom at ten and they were to walk down to the river and talk over their future in the little pavilion abutting on the wall of the park
It was just a week since his arrival at Givre and Anna wished before he left to return to the place where they had sat on their first afternoon together
Her sensitiveness to the appeal of inanimate things to the colour and texture of whatever wove itself into the substance of her emotion made her want to hear Darrows voice and to feel his eyes on her in the spot where bliss had first flowed into her heart
That bliss in the interval had wound itself into every fold of her being
Passing in the first days from a high shy tenderness to the rush of a secret surrender it had gradually widened and deepened to flow on in redoubled beauty
She thought she now knew exactly how and why she loved Darrow and she could see her whole sky reflected in the deep and tranquil current of her love
Early the next day in her sittingroom she was glancing through the letters which it was Effies morning privilege to carry up to her
Effie meanwhile circled inquisitively about the room where there was always something new to engage her infant fancy and Anna looking up saw her suddenly arrested before a photograph of Darrow which the day before had taken its place on the writingtable
Anna held out her arms with a faint blush
You do like him dont you dear
Oh most awfully dearest Effie against her breast leaned back to assure her with a limpid look
And so do Granny and Owenand I DO think Sophy does too she added after a moments earnest pondering
I hope so Anna laughed
She checked the impulse to continue Has she talked to you about him that youre so sure
She did not know what had made the question spring to her lips but she was glad she had closed them before pronouncing it
Nothing could have been more distasteful to her than to clear up such obscurities by turning on them the tiny flame of her daughters observation
And what after all now that Owens happiness was secured did it matter if there were certain reserves in Darrows approval of his marriage
A knock on the door made Anna glance at the clock
Theres Nurse to carry you off
Its Sophys knock the little girl answered jumping down to open the door and Miss Viner in fact stood on the threshold
Come in Anna said with a smile instantly remarking how pale she looked
May Effie go out for a turn with Nurse
the girl asked
I should like to speak to you a moment
Of course
This ought to be YOUR holiday as yesterday was Effies
Run off dear she added stooping to kiss the little girl
When the door had closed she turned back to Sophy Viner with a look that sought her confidence
Im so glad you came my dear
Weve got so many things to talk about just you and I together
The confused intercourse of the last days had in fact left little time for any speech with Sophy but such as related to her marriage and the means of overcoming Madame de Chantelles opposition to it
Anna had exacted of Owen that no one not even Sophy Viner should be given a hint of her own projects till all contingent questions had been disposed of
She had felt from the outset a secret reluctance to intrude her securer happiness on the doubts and fears of the young pair
From the sofacorner to which she had dropped back she pointed to Darrows chair
Come and sit by me dear
I wanted to see you alone
Theres so much to say that I hardly know where to begin
She leaned forward her hands clasped on the arms of the sofa her eyes bent smilingly on Sophys
As she did so she noticed that the girls unusual pallour was partly due to the slight veil of powder on her face
The discovery was distinctly disagreeable
Anna had never before noticed on Sophys part any recourse to cosmetics and much as she wished to think herself exempt from oldfashioned prejudices she suddenly became aware that she did not like her daughters governess to have a powdered face
Then she reflected that the girl who sat opposite her was no longer Effies governess but her own future daughterinlaw and she wondered whether Miss Viner had chosen this odd way of celebrating her independence and whether as Mrs Owen Leath she would present to the world a bedizened countenance
This idea was scarcely less distasteful than the other and for a moment Anna continued to consider her without speaking
Then in a flash the truth came to her Miss Viner had powdered her face because Miss Viner had been crying
Anna leaned forward impulsively
My dear child whats the matter
She saw the girls blood rush up under the white mask and hastened on Please dont be afraid to tell me
I do so want you to feel that you can trust me as Owen does
And you know you mustnt mind if just at first Madame de Chantelle occasionally relapses
She spoke eagerly persuasively almost on a note of pleading
She had in truth so many reasons for wanting Sophy to like her her love for Owen her solicitude for Effie and her own sense of the girls fine mettle
She had always felt a romantic and almost humble admiration for those members of her sex who from force of will or the constraint of circumstances had plunged into the conflict from which fate had so persistently excluded her
There were even moments when she fancied herself vaguely to blame for her immunity and felt that she ought somehow to have affronted the perils and hardships which refused to come to her
And now as she sat looking at Sophy Viner so small so slight so visibly defenceless and undone she still felt through all the superiority of her worldly advantages and her seeming maturity the same odd sense of ignorance and inexperience
She could not have said what there was in the girls manner and expression to give her this feeling but she was reminded as she looked at Sophy Viner of the other girls she had known in her youth the girls who seemed possessed of a secret she had missed
Yes Sophy Viner had their lookalmost the obscurely menacing look of Kitty MayneAnna with an inward smile brushed aside the image of this forgotten rival
But she had felt deep down a twinge of the old pain and she was sorry that even for the flash of a thought Owens betrothed should have reminded her of so different a woman She laid her hand on the girls
When his grandmother sees how happy Owen is shell be quite happy herself
If its only that dont be distressed
Just trust to Owenand the future
Sophy Viner with an almost imperceptible recoil of her whole slight person had drawn her hand from under the palm enclosing it
Thats what I wanted to talk to you aboutthe future
Of course
Weve all so many plans to makeand to fit into each others
Please lets begin with yours
The girl paused a moment her hands clasped on the arms of her chair her lids dropped under Annas gaze then she said I should like to make no plans at alljust yet No plans
NoI should like to go awaymy friends the Farlows would let me go to them Her voice grew firmer and she lifted her eyes to add I should like to leave today if you dont mind
Anna listened with a rising wonder
You want to leave Givre at once
She gave the idea a moments swift consideration
You prefer to be with your friends till your marriage
I understand thatbut surely you neednt rush off today
There are so many details to discuss and before long you know I shall be going away too
Yes I know
The girl was evidently trying to steady her voice
But I should like to wait a few daysto have a little more time to myself
Anna continued to consider her kindly
It was evident that she did not care to say why she wished to leave Givre so suddenly but her disturbed face and shaken voice betrayed a more pressing motive than the natural desire to spend the weeks before her marriage under her old friends roof
Since she had made no response to the allusion to Madame de Chantelle Anna could but conjecture that she had had a passing disagreement with Owen and if this were so random interference might do more harm than good
My dear child if you really want to go at once I shant of course urge you to stay
I suppose you have spoken to Owen
No
Not yet Anna threw an astonished glance at her
You mean to say you havent told him
I wanted to tell you first
I thought I ought to on account of Effie
Her look cleared as she put forth this reason
Oh Effie Annas smile brushed away the scruple
Owen has a right to ask that you should consider him before you think of his sisterOf course you shall do just as you wish she went on after another thoughtful interval
Oh thank you Sophy Viner murmured and rose to her feet
Anna rose also vaguely seeking for some word that should break down the girls resistance
Youll tell Owen at once
she finally asked
Miss Viner instead of replying stood before her in manifest uncertainty and as she did so there was a light tap on the door and Owen Leath walked into the room
Annas first glance told her that his face was unclouded
He met her greeting with his happiest smile and turned to lift Sophys hand to his lips
The perception that he was utterly unconscious of any cause for Miss Viners agitation came to his stepmother with a sharp thrill of surprise
Darrows looking for you he said to her
He asked me to remind you that youd promised to go for a walk with him
Anna glanced at the clock
Ill go down presently
She waited and looked again at Sophy Viner whose troubled eyes seemed to commit their message to her
Youd better tell Owen my dear
Owens look also turned on the girl
Tell me what
Why whats happened
Anna summoned a laugh to ease the vague tension of the moment
Dont look so startled
Nothing except that Sophy proposes to desert us for a while for the Farlows
Owens brow cleared
I was afraid shed run off before long
He glanced at Anna
Do please keep her here as long as you can
Sophy intervened Mrs Leaths already given me leave to go
Already
To go when
Today said Sophy in a low tone her eyes on Annas
Today
Why on earth should you go today
Owen dropped back a step or two flushing and paling under his bewildered frown
His eyes seemed to search the girl more closely
Somethings happened
He too looked at his stepmother
I suppose she must have told you what it is
Anna was struck by the suddenness and vehemence of his appeal
It was as though some smouldering apprehension had lain close under the surface of his security
Shes told me nothing except that she wishes to be with her friends
Its quite natural that she should want to go to them
Owen visibly controlled himself
Of coursequite natural
He spoke to Sophy
But why didnt you tell me so
Why did you come first to my stepmother
Anna intervened with her calm smile
That seems to me quite natural too
Sophy was considerate enough to tell me first because of Effie
He weighed it
Very well then thats quite natural as you say
And of course she must do exactly as she pleases
He still kept his eyes on the girl
Tomorrow he abruptly announced I shall go up to Paris to see you
Oh nono
she protested
Owen turned back to Anna
NOW do you say that nothings happened
Under the influence of his agitation Anna felt a vague tightening of the heart
She seemed to herself like some one in a dark room about whom unseen presences are groping
If its anything that Sophy wishes to tell you no doubt shell do so
Im going down now and Ill leave you here to talk it over by yourselves
As she moved to the door the girl caught up with her
But theres nothing to tell why should there be
Ive explained that I simply want to be quiet
Her look seemed to detain Mrs Leath
Owen broke in Is that why I maynt go up tomorrow
Not tomorrow
Then when may I
Laterin a little whilea few days In how many days
Owen
his stepmother interposed but he seemed no longer aware of her
If you go away today the day that our engagements made known its only fair he persisted that you should tell me when I am to see you
Sophys eyes wavered between the two and dropped down wearily
Its you who are not fairwhen Ive said I wanted to be quiet
But why should my coming disturb you
Im not asking now to come tomorrow
I only ask you not to leave without telling me when Im to see you
Owen I dont understand you
his stepmother exclaimed
You dont understand my asking for some explanation some assurance when Im left in this way without a word without a sign
All I ask her to tell me is when shell see me
Anna turned back to Sophy Viner who stood straight and tremulous between the two
After all my dear hes not unreasonable
Ill writeIll write the girl repeated
WHAT will you write
he pressed her vehemently
Owen Anna exclaimed you are unreasonable
He turned from Sophy to his stepmother
I only want her to say what she means that shes going to write to break off our engagement
Isnt that what youre going away for
Anna felt the contagion of his excitement
She looked at Sophy who stood motionless her lips set her whole face drawn to a silent fixity of resistance
You ought to speak my dearyou ought to answer him
I only ask him to wait Yes Owen broke in and you wont say how long
Both instinctively addressed themselves to Anna who stood nearly as shaken as themselves between the double shock of their struggle
She looked again from Sophys inscrutable eyes to Owens stormy features then she said What can I do when theres clearly something between you that I dont know about
Oh if it WERE between us
Cant you see its outside of usoutside of her dragging at her dragging her away from me
Owen wheeled round again upon his stepmother
Anna turned from him to the girl
Is it true that you want to break your engagement
If you do you ought to tell him now
Owen burst into a laugh
She doesnt dare toshes afraid Ill guess the reason
A faint sound escaped from Sophys lips but she kept them close on whatever answer she had ready
If she doesnt wish to marry you why should she be afraid to have you know the reason
Shes afraid to have YOU know itnot me
To have ME know it
He laughed again and Anna at his laugh felt a sudden rush of indignation
Owen you must explain what you mean
He looked at her hard before answering then Ask Darrow
he said
OwenOwen
Sophy Viner murmured
XXIV Anna stood looking from one to the other
It had become apparent to her in a flash that Owens retort though it startled Sophy did not take her by surprise and the discovery shot its light along dark distances of fear
The immediate inference was that Owen had guessed the reason of Darrows disapproval of his marriage or that at least he suspected Sophy Viner of knowing and dreading it
This confirmation of her own obscure doubt sent a tremor of alarm through Anna
For a moment she felt like exclaiming All this is really no business of mine and I refuse to have you mix me up in it but her secret fear held her fast
Sophy Viner was the first to speak
I should like to go now she said in a low voice taking a few steps toward the door
Her tone woke Anna to the sense of her own share in the situation
I quite agree with you my dear that its useless to carry on this discussion
But since Mr Darrows name has been brought into it for reasons which I fail to guess I want to tell you that youre both mistaken if you think hes not in sympathy with your marriage
If thats what Owen means to imply the ideas a complete delusion
She spoke the words deliberately and incisively as if hoping that the sound of their utterance would stifle the whisper in her bosom
Sophys only answer was a vague murmur and a movement that brought her nearer to the door but before she could reach it Owen had placed himself in her way
I dont mean to imply what you think he said addressing his stepmother but keeping his eyes on the girl
I dont say Darrow doesnt like our marriage I say its Sophy whos hated it since Darrows been here
He brought out the charge in a tone of forced composure but his lips were white and he grasped the doorknob to hide the tremor of his hand
Annas anger surged up with her fears
Youre absurd Owen
I dont know why I listen to you
Why should Sophy dislike Mr Darrow and if she does why should that have anything to do with her wishing to break her engagement
I dont say she dislikes him
I dont say she likes him I dont know what it is they say to each other when theyre shut up together alone
Shut up together alone
Anna stared
Owen seemed like a man in delirium such an exhibition was degrading to them all
But he pushed on without seeing her look
Yesthe first evening she came in the study the next morning early in the park yesterday again in the springhouse when you were at the lodge with the doctorI dont know what they say to each other but theyve taken every chance they could to say itand to say it when they thought that no one saw them
Anna longed to silence him but no words came to her
It was as though all her confused apprehensions had suddenly taken definite shape
There was somethingyes there was somethingDarrows reticences and evasions had been more than a figment of her doubts
The next instant brought a recoil of pride
She turned indignantly on her stepson
I dont half understand what youve been saying but what you seem to hint is so preposterous and so insulting both to Sophy and to me that I see no reason why we should listen to you any longer
Though her tone steadied Owen she perceived at once that it would not deflect him from his purpose
He spoke less vehemently but with all the more precision
How can it be preposterous since its true
Or insulting since I dont know any more than YOU the meaning of what Ive been seeing
If youll be patient with me Ill try to put it quietly
What I mean is that Sophy has completely changed since she met Darrow here and that having noticed the change Im hardly to blame for having tried to find out its cause
Anna made an effort to answer him with the same composure
Youre to blame at any rate for so recklessly assuming that you HAVE found it out
You seem to forget that till they met here Sophy and Mr Darrow hardly knew each other
If so its all the stranger that theyve been so often closeted together
Owen Owen the girl sighed out
He turned his haggard face to her
Can I help it if Ive seen and known what I wasnt meant to
For Gods sake give me a reasonany reason I can decently make out with
Is it my fault if the day after you arrived when I came back late through the garden the curtains of the study hadnt been drawn and I saw you there alone with Darrow
Anna laughed impatiently
Really Owen if you make it a grievance that two people who are staying in the same house should be seen talking together
They were not talking
Thats the point Not talking
How do you know
You could hardly hear them from the garden
No but I could see
HE was sitting at my desk with his face in his hands
SHE was standing in the window looking away from him He waited as if for Sophy Viners answer but still she neither stirred nor spoke
That was the first time he went on and the second was the next morning in the park
It was natural enough their meeting there
Sophy had gone out with Effie and Effie ran back to look for me
She told me shed left Sophy and Darrow in the path that leads to the river and presently we saw them ahead of us
They didnt see us at first because they were standing looking at each other and this time they were not speaking either
We came up close before they heard us and all that time they never spoke or stopped looking at each other
After that I began to wonder and so I watched them
Oh Owen
Oh I only had to wait
Yesterday when I motored you and the doctor back from the lodge I saw Sophy coming out of the springhouse
I supposed shed taken shelter from the rain and when you got out of the motor I strolled back down the avenue to meet her
But shed disappearedshe must have taken a short cut and come into the house by the side door
I dont know why I went on to the springhouse I suppose it was what youd call spying
I went up the steps and found the room empty but two chairs had been moved out from the wall and were standing near the table and one of the Chinese screens that lie on it had dropped to the floor
Anna sounded a faint note of irony
Really
Sophyd gone there for shelter and she dropped a screen and moved a chair
I said two chairs Two
What damning evidenceof I dont know what
Simply of the fact that Darrowd been there with her
As I looked out of the window I saw him close by walking away
He must have turned the corner of the springhouse just as I got to the door
There was another silence during which Anna paused not only to collect her own words but to wait for Sophy Viners then as the girl made no sign she turned to her
Ive absolutely nothing to say to all this but perhaps youd like me to wait and hear your answer
Sophy raised her head with a quick flash of colour
Ive no answer eitherexcept that Owen must be mad
In the interval since she had last spoken she seemed to have regained her selfcontrol and her voice rang clear with a cold edge of anger
Anna looked at her stepson
He had grown extremely pale and his hand fell from the door with a discouraged gesture
Thats all then
You wont give me any reason
I didnt suppose it was necessary to give you or any one else a reason for talking with a friend of Mrs Leaths under Mrs Leaths own roof
Owen hardly seemed to feel the retort he kept his dogged stare on her face
I wont ask for one then
Ill only ask you to give me your assurance that your talks with Darrow have had nothing to do with your suddenly deciding to leave Givre
She hesitated not so much with the air of weighing her answer as of questioning his right to exact any
I give you my assurance and now I should like to go she said
As she turned away Anna intervened
My dear I think you ought to speak
The girl drew herself up with a faint laugh
To himor to YOU
To him
She stiffened
Ive said all there is to say
Anna drew back her eyes on her stepson
He had left the threshold and was advancing toward Sophy Viner with a motion of desperate appeal but as he did so there was a knock on the door
A moments silence fell on the three then Anna said Come in
Darrow came into the room
Seeing the three together he looked rapidly from one to the other then he turned to Anna with a smile
I came up to see if you were ready but please send me off if Im not wanted
His look his voice the simple sense of his presence restored Annas shaken balance
By Owens side he looked so strong so urbane so experienced that the lads passionate charges dwindled to mere boyish vapourings
A moment ago she had dreaded Darrows coming now she was glad that he was there
She turned to him with sudden decision
Come in please I want you to hear what Owen has been saying
She caught a murmur from Sophy Viner but disregarded it
An illuminating impulse urged her on
She habitually so aware of her own lack of penetration her small skill in reading hidden motives and detecting secret signals now felt herself mysteriously inspired
She addressed herself to Sophy Viner
Its much better for you both that this absurd question should be cleared up now  Then turning to Darrow she continued For some reason that I dont pretend to guess Owen has taken it into his head that youve influenced Miss Viner to break her engagement
She spoke slowly and deliberately because she wished to give time and to gain it time for Darrow and Sophy to receive the full impact of what she was saying and time to observe its full effect on them
She had said to herself If theres nothing between them theyll look at each other if there IS something they wont and as she ceased to speak she felt as if all her life were in her eyes
Sophy after a start of protest remained motionless her gaze on the ground
Darrow his face grown grave glanced slowly from Owen Leath to Anna
With his eyes on the latter he asked Has Miss Viner broken her engagement
A moments silence followed his question then the girl looked up and said Yes
Owen as she spoke uttered a smothered exclamation and walked out of the room
She continued to stand in the same place without appearing to notice his departure and without vouchsafing an additional word of explanation then before Anna could find a cry to detain her she too turned and went out
For Gods sake whats happened
Darrow asked but Anna with a drop of the heart was saying to herself that he and Sophy Viner had not looked at each other
XXV Anna stood in the middle of the room her eyes on the door
Darrows questioning gaze was still on her and she said to herself with a quickdrawn breath If only he doesnt come near me
It seemed to her that she had been suddenly endowed with the fatal gift of reading the secret sense of every seemingly spontaneous look and movement and that in his least gesture of affection she would detect a cold design
For a moment longer he continued to look at her enquiringly then he turned away and took up his habitual stand by the mantelpiece
She drew a deep breath of relief 
Wont you please explain
he said
I cant explain I dont know
I didnt even knowtill she told youthat she really meant to break her engagement
All I know is that she came to me just now and said she wished to leave Givre today and that Owen when he heard of itfor she hadnt told himat once accused her of going away with the secret intention of throwing him over
And you think its a definite break
She perceived as she spoke that his brow had cleared
How should I know
Perhaps you can tell me
I
She fancied his face clouded again but he did not move from his tranquil attitude
As I told you she went on Owen has worked himself up to imagining that for some mysterious reason youve influenced Sophy against him
Darrow still visibly wondered
It must indeed be a mysterious reason
He knows how slightly I know Miss Viner
Why should he imagine anything so wildly improbable
I dont know that either
But he must have hinted at some reason
No he admits he doesnt know your reason
He simply says that Sophys manner to him has changed since she came back to Givre and that hes seen you together several timesin the park the springhouse I dont know wheretalking alone in a way that seemed confidentialalmost secret and he draws the preposterous conclusion that youve used your influence to turn her against him
My influence
What kind of influence
He doesnt say
Darrow again seemed to turn over the facts she gave him
His face remained grave but without the least trace of discomposure
And what does Miss Viner say
She says its perfectly natural that she should occasionally talk to my friends when shes under my roof and refuses to give him any other explanation
That at least is perfectly natural
Anna felt her cheeks flush as she answered Yesbut there is something Something
Some reason for her sudden decision to break her engagement
I can understand Owens feeling sorry as I am for his way of showing it
The girl owes him some sort of explanation and as long as she refuses to give it his imagination is sure to run wild
She would have given it no doubt if he d asked it in a different tone
I dont defend Owens tonebut she knew what it was before she accepted him
She knows hes excitable and undisciplined
Well shes been disciplining him a littleprobably the best thing that could happen
Why not let the matter rest there
Leave Owen with the idea that you HAVE been the cause of the break
He met the question with his easy smile
Oh as to that leave him with any idea of me he chooses
But leave him at any rate free
Free
she echoed in surprise
Simply let things be
Youve surely done all you could for him and Miss Viner
If they dont hit it off its their own affair
What possible motive can you have for trying to interfere now
Her gaze widened to a deeper wonder
Whynaturally what he says of you
I dont care a straw what he says of me
In such a situation a boy in love will snatch at the most farfetched reason rather than face the mortifying fact that the lady may simply be tired of him
You don t quite understand Owen
Things go deep with him and last long
It took him a long time to recover from his other unlucky love affair
Hes romantic and extravagant he cant live on the interest of his feelings
He worships Sophy and she seemed to be fond of him
If shes changed its been very sudden
And if they part like this angrily and inarticulately it will hurt him horriblyhurt his very soul
But that as you say is between the two
What concerns me is his associating you with their quarrel
Owens like my own sonif youd seen him when I first came here youd know why
We were like two prisoners who talk to each other by tapping on the wall
Hes never forgotten it nor I
Whether he breaks with Sophy or whether they make it up I cant let him think you had anything to do with it
She raised her eyes entreatingly to Darrows and read in them the forbearance of the man resigned to the discussion of nonexistent problems
Ill do whatever you want me to he said but I dont yet know what it is
His smile seemed to charge her with inconsequence and the prick to her pride made her continue After all its not so unnatural that Owen knowing you and Sophy to be almost strangers should wonder what you were saying to each other when he saw you talking together
She felt a warning tremor as she spoke as though some instinct deeper than reason surged up in defense of its treasure
But Darrows face was unstirred save by the flit of his halfamused smile
Well my dearand couldnt you have told him
I
she faltered out through her blush
You seem to forget one and all of you the position you put me in when I came down here your appeal to me to see Owen through your assurance to him that I would Madame de Chantelles attempt to win me over and most of all my own sense of the fact youve just recalled to me the importance for both of us that Owen should like me
It seemed to me that the first thing to do was to get as much light as I could on the whole situation and the obvious way of doing it was to try to know Miss Viner better
Of course Ive talked with her aloneIve talked with her as often as I could
Ive tried my best to find out if you were right in encouraging Owen to marry her
She listened with a growing sense of reassurance struggling to separate the abstract sense of his words from the persuasion in which his eyes and voice enveloped them
I seeI do see she murmured
You must see also that I could hardly say this to Owen without offending him still more and perhaps increasing the breach between Miss Viner and himself
What sort of figure should I cut if I told him Id been trying to find out if hed made a proper choice
In any case its none of my business to offer an explanation of what she justly says doesnt need one
If she declines to speak its obviously on the ground that Owens insinuations are absurd and that surely pledges me to silence
Yes yes
I see Anna repeated
But I dont want you to explain anything to Owen
You havent yet told me what you do want
She hesitated conscious of the difficulty of justifying her request then I want you to speak to Sophy she said
Darrow broke into an incredulous laugh
Considering what my previous attempts have resulted in
She raised her eyes quickly
They havent at least resulted in your liking her less in your thinking less well of her than youve told me
She fancied he frowned a little
I wonder why you go back to that
I want to be sureI owe it to Owen
Wont you tell me the exact impression shes produced on you
I have told youI like Miss Viner
Do you still believe shes in love with Owen
There was nothing in our short talks to throw any particular light on that
You still believe though that theres no reason why he shouldnt marry her
Again he betrayed a restrained impatience
How can I answer that without knowing her reasons for breaking with him
Thats just what I want you to find out from her
And why in the world should she tell me
Because whatever grievance she has against Owen she can certainly have none against me
She cant want to have Owen connect me in his mind with this wretched quarrel and she must see that he will until hes convinced youve had no share in it
Darrows elbow dropped from the mantelpiece and he took a restless step or two across the room
Then he halted before her
Why cant you tell her this yourself
Dont you see
He eyed her intently and she pressed on You must have guessed that Owens jealous of you
Jealous of me
The blood flew up under his brown skin
Blind with itwhat else would drive him to this folly
And I cant have her think me jealous too
Ive said all I could short of making her think so and shes refused a word more to either of us
Our only chance now is that she should listen to youthat you should make her see the harm her silence may do
Darrow uttered a protesting exclamation
Its all too preposterouswhat you suggest
I cant at any rate appeal to her on such a ground as that
Anna laid her hand on his arm
Appeal to her on the ground that Im almost Owens mother and that any estrangement between you and him would kill me
She knows what he is shell understand
Tell her to say anything do anything she wishes but not to go away without speaking not to leave THAT between us when she goes
She drew back a step and lifted her face to his trying to look into his eyes more deeply than she had ever looked but before she could discern what they expressed he had taken hold of her hands and bent his head to kiss them
Youll see her
Youll see her
she entreated and he answered Ill do anything in the world you want me to
XXVI Darrow waited alone in the sittingroom
No place could have been more distasteful as the scene of the talk that lay before him but he had acceded to Annas suggestion that it would seem more natural for her to summon Sophy Viner than for him to go in search of her
As his troubled pacings carried him back and forth a relentless hand seemed to be tearing away all the tender fibres of association that bound him to the peaceful room
Here in this very place he had drunk his deepest draughts of happiness had had his lips at the fountainhead of its overflowing rivers but now that source was poisoned and he would taste no more of an untainted cup
For a moment he felt an actual physical anguish then his nerves hardened for the coming struggle
He had no notion of what awaited him but after the first instinctive recoil he had seen in a flash the urgent need of another word with Sophy Viner
He had been insincere in letting Anna think that he had consented to speak because she asked it
In reality he had been feverishly casting about for the pretext she had given him and for some reason this trivial hypocrisy weighed on him more than all his heavy burden of deceit
At length he heard a step behind him and Sophy Viner entered
When she saw him she paused on the threshold and half drew back
I was told that Mrs Leath had sent for me
Mrs Leath DID send for you
Shell be here presently but I asked her to let me see you first
He spoke very gently and there was no insincerity in his gentleness
He was profoundly moved by the change in the girls appearance
At sight of him she had forced a smile but it lit up her wretchedness like a candleflame held to a dead face
She made no reply and Darrow went on You must understand my wanting to speak to you after what I was told just now
She interposed with a gesture of protest Im not responsible for Owens ravings
Of course
He broke off and they stood facing each other
She lifted a hand and pushed back her loose lock with the gesture that was burnt into his memory then she looked about her and dropped into the nearest chair
Well youve got what you wanted she said
What do you mean by what I wanted
My engagements brokenyou heard me say so
Why do you say thats what I wanted
All I wished from the beginning was to advise you to help you as best I could  Thats what youve done she rejoined
Youve convinced me that its best I shouldnt marry him
Darrow broke into a despairing laugh
At the very moment when youd convinced me to the contrary
Had I
Her smile flickered up
Well I really believed it till you showed mewarned me Warned you
That Id be miserable if I married a man I didnt love
Dont you love him
She made no answer and Darrow started up and walked away to the other end of the room
He stopped before the writing table where his photograph welldressed handsome self sufficientthe portrait of a man of the world confident of his ability to deal adequately with the most delicate situationsoffered its huge fatuity to his gaze
He turned back to her
Its rather hard on Owen isnt it that you should have waited until now to tell him
She reflected a moment before answering
I told him as soon as I knew
Knew that you couldnt marry him
Knew that I could never live here with him
She looked about the room as though the very walls must speak for her
For a moment Darrow continued to search her face perplexedly then their eyes met in a long disastrous gaze
Yes she said and stood up
Below the window they heard Effie whistling for her dogs and then from the terrace her mother calling her
ThereTHAT for instance Sophy Viner said
Darrow broke out Its I who ought to go
She kept her small pale smile
What good would that do any of usnow
He covered his face with his hands
Good God
he groaned
How could I tell
You couldnt tell
We neither of us could
She seemed to turn the problem over critically
After all it might have been YOU instead of me
He took another distracted turn about the room and coming back to her sat down in a chair at her side
A mocking hand seemed to dash the words from his lips
There was nothing on earth that he could say to her that wasnt foolish or cruel or contemptible My dear he began at last oughtnt you at any rate to try
Her gaze grew grave
Try to forget you
He flushed to the forehead
I meant try to give Owen more time to give him a chance
Hes madly in love with you all the good thats in him is in your hands
His stepmother felt that from the first
And she thoughtshe believed  She thought I could make him happy
Would she think so now
Now
I dont say now
But later
Time modifiesrubs outmore quickly than you thinkGo away but let him hopeIm going tooWERE going he stumbled on the pluralin a very few weeks going for a long time probably
What youre thinking of now may never happen
We may not all be here together again for years
She heard him out in silence her hands clasped on her knee her eyes bent on them
For me she said youll always be here
Dont say thatoh dont
Things changepeople changeYoull see
You dont understand
I dont want anything to change
I dont want to forgetto rub out
At first I imagined I did but that was a foolish mistake
As soon as I saw you again I knew itIts not being here with you that Im afraid ofin the sense you think
Its being here or anywhere with Owen
She stood up and bent her tragic smile on him
I want to keep you all to myself
The only words that came to him were futile denunciations of his folly but the sense of their futility checked them on his lips
Poor childyou poor child
he heard himself vainly repeating
Suddenly he felt the strong reaction of reality and its impetus brought him to his feet
Whatever happens I intend to goto go for good he exclaimed
I want you to understand that
Oh dont be afraidIll find a reason
But its perfectly clear that I must go
She uttered a protesting cry
Go away
You
Dont you see that that would tell everythingdrag everybody into the horror
He found no answer and her voice dropped back to its calmer note
What good would your going do
Do you suppose it would change anything for me
She looked at him with a musing wistfulness
I wonder what your feeling for me was
It seems queer that Ive never really knownI suppose we DONT know much about that kind of feeling
Is it like taking a drink when youre thirstyI used to feel as if all of me was in the palm of your hand He bowed his humbled head but she went on almost exultantly Dont for a minute think Im sorry
It was worth every penny it cost
My mistake was in being ashamed just at first of its having cost such a lot
I tried to carry it off as a joketo talk of it to myself as an adventure
Id always wanted adventures and youd given me one and I tried to take your attitude about it to play the game and convince myself that I hadnt risked any more on it than you
Then when I met you again I suddenly saw that I HAD risked more but that Id won more toosuch worlds
Id been trying all the while to put everything I could between us now I want to sweep everything away
Id been trying to forget how you looked now I want to remember you always
Id been trying not to hear your voice now I never want to hear any other
Ive made my choicethats all Ive had you and I mean to keep you
Her face was shining like her eyes
To keep you hidden away here she ended and put her hand upon her breast
After she had left him Darrow continued to sit motionless staring back into their past
Hitherto it had lingered on the edge of his mind in a vague pink blur like one of the little roseleaf clouds that a setting sun drops from its disk
Now it was a huge looming darkness through which his eyes vainly strained
The whole episode was still obscure to him save where here and there as they talked some phrase or gesture or intonation of the girls had lit up a little spot in the night
She had said I wonder what your feeling for me was
and he found himself wondering tooHe remembered distinctly enough that he had not meant the perilous passioneven in its most transient formto play a part in their relation
In that respect his attitude had been above reproach
She was an unusually original and attractive creature to whom he had wanted to give a few days of harmless pleasuring and who was alert and expert enough to understand his intention and spare him the boredom of hesitations and misinterpretations
That had been his first impression and her subsequent demeanour had justified it
She had been from the outset just the frank and easy comrade he had expected to find her
Was it he then who in the sequel had grown impatient of the bounds he had set himself
Was it his wounded vanity that seeking balm for its hurt yearned to dip deeper into the healing pool of her compassion
In his confused memory of the situation he seemed not to have been guiltless of such yearningsYet for the first few days the experiment had been perfectly successful
Her enjoyment had been unclouded and his pleasure in it undisturbed
It was very graduallyhe seemed to seethat a shade of lassitude had crept over their intercourse
Perhaps it was because when her light chatter about people failed he found she had no other fund to draw on or perhaps simply because of the sweetness of her laugh or of the charm of the gesture with which one day in the woods of Marly she had tossed off her hat and tilted back her head at the call of a cuckoo or because whenever he looked at her unexpectedly he found that she was looking at him and did not want him to know it or perhaps in varying degrees because of all these things that there had come a moment when no word seemed to fly high enough or dive deep enough to utter the sense of wellbeing each gave to the other and the natural substitute for speech had been a kiss
The kiss at all events had come at the precise moment to save their venture from disaster
They had reached the point when her amazing reminiscences had begun to flag when her future had been exhaustively discussed her theatrical prospects minutely studied her quarrel with Mrs Murrett retold with the last amplification of detail and when perhaps conscious of her exhausted resources and his dwindling interest she had committed the fatal error of saying that she could see he was unhappy and entreating him to tell her why From the brink of estranging confidences and from the risk of unfavourable comparisons his gesture had snatched her back to safety and as soon as he had kissed her he felt that she would never bore him again
She was one of the elemental creatures whose emotion is all in their pulses and who become inexpressive or sentimental when they try to turn sensation into speech
His caress had restored her to her natural place in the scheme of things and Darrow felt as if he had clasped a tree and a nymph had bloomed from it
The mere fact of not having to listen to her any longer added immensely to her charm
She continued of course to talk to him but it didnt matter because he no longer made any effort to follow her words but let her voice run on as a musical undercurrent to his thoughts
She hadnt a drop of poetry in her but she had some of the qualities that create it in others and in moments of heat the imagination does not always feel the difference
Lying beside her in the shade Darrow felt her presence as a part of the charmed stillness of the summer woods as the element of vague wellbeing that suffused his senses and lulled to sleep the ache of wounded pride
All he asked of her as yet was a touch on the hand or on the lipsand that she should let him go on lying there through the long warm hours while a blackbirds song throbbed like a fountain and the summer wind stirred in the trees and close by between the nearest branches and the brim of his tilted hat a slight white figure gathered up all the floating threads of joy
He recalled too having noticed as he lay staring at a break in the treetops a stream of marestails coming up the sky
He had said to himself It will rain tomorrow and the thought had made the air seem warmer and the sun more vivid on her hairPerhaps if the marestails had not come up the sky their adventure might have had no sequel
But the cloud brought rain and next morning he looked out of his window into a cold grey blur
They had planned an allday excursion down the Seine to the two Andelys and Rouen and now with the long hours on their hands they were both a little at a lossThere was the Louvre of course and the Luxembourg but he had tried looking at pictures with her she had first so persistently admired the worst things and then so frankly lapsed into indifference that he had no wish to repeat the experiment
So they went out aimlessly and took a cold wet walk turning at length into the deserted arcades of the Palais Royal and finally drifting into one of its equally deserted restaurants where they lunched alone and somewhat dolefully served by a wan old waiter with the look of a castaway who has given up watching for a sailIt was odd how the waiters face came back to him Perhaps but for the rain it might never have happened but what was the use of thinking of that now
He tried to turn his thoughts to more urgent issues but by a strange perversity of association every detail of the day was forcing itself on his mind with an insistence from which there was no escape
Reluctantly he relived the long wet walk back to the hotel after a tedious hour at a cinematograph show on the Boulevard
It was still raining when they withdrew from this stale spectacle but she had obstinately refused to take a cab had even on the way insisted on loitering under the dripping awnings of shop windows and poking into draughty passages and finally when they had nearly reached their destination had gone so far as to suggest that they should turn back to hunt up some show she had heard of in a theatre at the Batignolles
But at that he had somewhat irritably protested he remembered that for the first time they were both rather irritable and vaguely disposed to resist one anothers suggestions
His feet were wet and he was tired of walking and sick of the smell of stuffy unaired theatres and he had said he must really get back to write some lettersand so they had kept on to the hotel XXVII Darrow had no idea how long he had sat there when he heard Annas hand on the door
The effort of rising and of composing his face to meet her gave him a factitious sense of selfcontrol
He said to himself I must decide on something and that lifted him a hairs breadth above the whirling waters
She came in with a lighter step and he instantly perceived that something unforeseen and reassuring had happened
Shes been with me
She came and found me on the terrace
Weve had a long talk and shes explained everything
I feel as if Id never known her before
Her voice was so moved and tender that it checked his start of apprehension
Shes explained
Its natural isnt it that she should have felt a little sore at the kind of inspection shes been subjected to
Oh not from youI dont mean that
But Madame de Chantelles oppositionand her sending for Adelaide Painter
She told me frankly she didnt care to owe her husband to Adelaide PainterShe thinks now that her annoyance at feeling herself so talked over and scrutinized may have shown itself in her manner to Owen and set him imagining the insane things he didI understand all she must have felt and I agree with her that its best she should go away for a while
Shes made me Anna summed up feel as if Id been dreadfully thickskinned and obtuse
YOU
Yes
As if Id treated her like the bricabrac that used to be sent down here on approval to see if it would look well with the other pieces
She added with a sudden flush of enthusiasm Im glad shes got it in her to make one feel like that
She seemed to wait for Darrow to agree with her or to put some other question and he finally found voice to ask Then you think its not a final break
I hope notIve never hoped it more
I had a word with Owen too after I left her and I think he understands that he must let her go without insisting on any positive promise
Shes excitedhe must let her calm down Again she waited and Darrow said Surely you can make him see that
Shell help me toshes to see him of course before she goes
She starts immediately by the way with Adelaide Painter who is motoring over to Francheuil to catch the one oclock expressand who of course knows nothing of all this and is simply to be told that Sophy has been sent for by the Farlows
Darrow mutely signed his comprehension and she went on Owen is particularly anxious that neither Adelaide nor his grandmother should have the least inkling of whats happened
The need of shielding Sophy will help him to control himself
Hes coming to his senses poor boy hes ashamed of his wild talk already
He asked me to tell you so no doubt hell tell you so himself
Darrow made a movement of protest
Oh as to thatthe things not worth another word
Or another thought either
She brightened
Promise me you wont even think of itpromise me you wont be hard on him
He was finding it easier to smile back at her
Why should you think it necessary to ask my indulgence for Owen
She hesitated a moment her eyes wandering from him
Then they came back with a smile
Perhaps because I need it for myself
For yourself
I mean because I understand better how one can torture ones self over unrealities
As Darrow listened the tension of his nerves began to relax
Her gaze so grave and yet so sweet was like a deep pool into which he could plunge and hide himself from the hard glare of his misery
As this ecstatic sense enveloped him he found it more and more difficult to follow her words and to frame an answer but what did anything matter except that her voice should go on and the syllables fall like soft touches on his tortured brain
Dont you know she continued the bliss of waking from a bad dream in ones own quiet room and going slowly over all the horror without being afraid of it any more
Thats what Im doing now
And thats why I understand Owen She broke off and he felt her touch on his arm
BECAUSE ID DREAMED THE HORROR TOO
He understood her then and stammered You
Forgive me
And let me tell youIt will help you to understand OwenThere WERE little thingslittle signsonce I had begun to watch for them your reluctance to speak about herher reserve with youa sort of constraint wed never seen in her before She laughed up at him and with her hands in his he contrived to say NOW you understand why
Oh I understand of course I understand and I want you to laugh at mewith me
Because there were other things toocrazier things stillThere was evenlast night on the terraceher pink cloak Her pink cloak
Now he honestly wondered and as she saw it she blushed
Youve forgotten about the cloak
The pink cloak that Owen saw you with at the play in Paris
YesyesI was mad enough for thatIt does me good to laugh about it now
But you ought to know that Im going to be a jealous womana ridiculously jealous womanyou ought to be warned of it in time He had dropped her hands and she leaned close and lifted her arms to his neck with one of her rare gestures of surrender
I dont know why it is but it makes me happier now to have been so foolish
Her lips were parted in a noiseless laugh and the tremor of her lashes made their shadow move on her cheek
He looked at her through a mist of pain and saw all her offered beauty held up like a cup to his lips but as he stooped to it a darkness seemed to fall between them her arms slipped from his shoulders and she drew away from him abruptly
But she WAS with you then
she exclaimed and then as he stared at her Oh dont say no
Only go and look at your eyes
He stood speechless and she pressed on Dont deny itoh dont deny it
What will be left for me to imagine if you do
Dont you see how every single thing cries it out
Owen sees ithe saw it again just now
When I told him shed relented and would see him he said Is that Darrows doing too
Darrow took the onslaught in silence
He might have spoken have summoned up the usual phrases of banter and denial he was not even certain that they might not for the moment have served their purpose if he could have uttered them without being seen
But he was as conscious of what had happened to his face as if he had obeyed Annas bidding and looked at himself in the glass
He knew he could no more hide from her what was written there than he could efface from his soul the fiery record of what he had just lived through
There before him staring him in the eyes and reflecting itself in all his lineaments was the overwhelming fact of Sophy Viners passion and of the act by which she had attested it
Anna was talking again hurriedly feverishly and his soul was wrung by the anguish in her voice
Do speak at last you must speak
I dont want to ask you to harm the girl but you must see that your silence is doing her more harm than your answering my questions could
Youre leaving me only the worst things to think of hershed see that herself if she were here
What worse injury can you do her than to make me hate herto make me feel shes plotted with you to deceive us
Oh not that
Darrow heard his own voice before he was aware that he meant to speak
Yes I did see her in Paris he went on after a pause but I was bound to respect her reason for not wanting it known
Anna paled
It was she at the theatre that night
I was with her at the theatre one night
Why should she have asked you not to say so
She didnt wish it known that Id met her
Why shouldnt she have wished it known
She had quarrelled with Mrs Murrett and come over suddenly to Paris and she didnt want the Farlows to hear of it
I came across her by accident and she asked me not to speak of having seen her
Because of her quarrel
Because she was ashamed of her part in it
Oh no
There was nothing for her to be ashamed of
But the Farlows had found the place for her and she didnt want them to know how suddenly shed had to leave and how badly Mrs Murrett had behaved
She was in a terrible plightthe woman had even kept back her months salary
She knew the Farlows would be awfully upset and she wanted more time to prepare them
Darrow heard himself speak as though the words had proceeded from other lips
His explanation sounded plausible enough and he halffancied Annas look grew lighter
She waited a moment as though to be sure he had no more to add then she said But the Farlows DID know they told me all about it when they sent her to me
He flushed as if she had laid a deliberate trap for him
They may know NOW they didnt then Thats no reason for her continuing now to make a mystery of having met you
Its the only reason I can give you
Then Ill go and ask her for one myself
She turned and took a few steps toward the door
Anna
He started to follow her and then checked himself
Dont do that
Why not
Its not like younot generous She stood before him straight and pale but under her rigid face he saw the tumult of her doubt and misery
I dont want to be ungenerous I dont want to pry into her secrets
But things cant be left like this
Wouldnt it be better for me to go to her
Surely shell understandshell explainIt may be some mere trifle shes concealing something that would horrify the Farlows but that I shouldnt see any harm in She paused her eyes searching his face
A love affair I supposethats it
You met her with some man at the theatreand she was frightened and begged you to fib about it
Those poor young things that have to go about among us like machinesoh if you knew how I pity them
If you pity her why not let her go
She stared
Let her gogo for good you mean
Is that the best you can say for her
Let things take their course
After all its between herself and Owen
And you and meand Effie if Owen marries her and I leave my child with them
Dont you see the impossibility of what youre asking
Were all bound together in this coil
Darrow turned away with a groan
Oh let her golet her go
Then there IS somethingsomething really bad
She WAS with some one when you met her
Some one with whom she was She broke off and he saw her struggling with new thoughts
If its THAT of courseOh dont you see she desperately appealed to him that I must find out and that its too late now for you not to speak
Dont be afraid that Ill betray youIll never never let a soul suspect
But I must know the truth and surely its best for her that I should find it out from you
Darrow waited a moment then he said slowly What you imagines mere madness
She was at the theatre with me
With you
He saw a tremor pass through her but she controlled it instantly and faced him straight and motionless as a wounded creature in the moment before it feels its wound
Why should you both have made a mystery of that
Ive told you the idea was not mine
He cast about
She may have been afraid that Owen But that was not a reason for her asking you to tell me that you hardly knew herthat you hadnt even seen her for years
She broke off and the blood rose to her face and forehead
Even if SHE had other reasons there could be only one reason for your obeying her Silence fell between them a silence in which the room seemed to become suddenly resonant with voices
Darrows gaze wandered to the window and he noticed that the gale of two days before had nearly stripped the tops of the lime trees in the court
Anna had moved away and was resting her elbows against the mantelpiece her head in her hands
As she stood there he took in with a new intensity of vision little details of her appearance that his eyes had often cherished the branching blue veins in the backs of her hands the warm shadow that her hair cast on her ear and the colour of the hair itself dull black with a tawny undersurface like the wings of certain birds
He felt it to be useless to speak
After a while she lifted her head and said I shall not see her again before she goes
He made no answer and turning to him she added That is why shes going I suppose
Because she loves you and wont give you up
Darrow waited
The paltriness of conventional denial was so apparent to him that even if it could have delayed discovery he could no longer have resorted to it
Under all his other fears was the dread of dishonouring the hour
She HAS given me up he said at last
XXVIII When he had gone out of the room Anna stood where he had left her
I must believe him
I must believe him
she said
A moment before at the moment when she had lifted her arms to his neck she had been wrapped in a sense of complete security
All the spirits of doubt had been exorcised and her love was once more the clear habitation in which every thought and feeling could move in blissful freedom
And then as she raised her face to Darrows and met his eyes she had seemed to look into the very ruins of his soul
That was the only way she could express it
It was as though he and she had been looking at two sides of the same thing and the side she had seen had been all light and life and his a place of graves She didnt now recall who had spoken first or even very clearly what had been said
It seemed to her only a moment later that she had found herself standing at the other end of the roomthe room which had suddenly grown so small that even with its length between them she felt as if he touched hercrying out to him It IS because of you shes going
and reading the avowal in his face
That was his secret then THEIR secret he had met the girl in Paris and helped her in her straitslent her money Anna vaguely conjecturedand she had fallen in love with him and on meeting him again had been suddenly overmastered by her passion
Anna dropping back into her sofacorner sat staring these facts in the face
The girl had been in a desperate plightfrightened penniless outraged by what had happened and not knowing with a woman like Mrs Murrett what fresh injury might impend and Darrow meeting her in this distracted hour had pitied counselled been kind to her with the fatal the inevitable result
There were the facts as Anna made them out that at least was their external aspect was as much of them as she had been suffered to see and into the secret intricacies they might cover she dared not yet project her thoughts
I must believe himI must believe him She kept on repeating the words like a talisman
It was natural after all that he should have behaved as he had defended the girls piteous secret to the last
She too began to feel the contagion of his pitythe stir in her breast of feelings deeper and more native to her than the pains of jealousy
From the security of her blessedness she longed to lean over with compassionate handsBut Owen
What was Owens part to be
She owed herself first to himshe was bound to protect him not only from all knowledge of the secret she had surprised but alsoand chieflyfrom its consequences
Yes the girl must gothere could be no doubt of itDarrow himself had seen it from the first and at the thought she had a wild revulsion of relief as though she had been trying to create in her heart the delusion of a generosity she could not feel
The one fact on which she could stay her mind was that Sophy was leaving immediately would be out of the house within an hour
Once she was gone it would be easier to bring Owen to the point of understanding that the break was final if necessary to work upon the girl to make him see it
But that Anna was sure would not be necessary
It was clear that Sophy Viner was leaving Givre with no thought of ever seeing it again
Suddenly as she tried to put some order in her thoughts she heard Owens call at the door Mother a name he seldom gave her
There was a new note in his voice the note of a joyous impatience
It made her turn hastily to the glass to see what face she was about to show him but before she had had time to compose it he was in the room and she was caught in a schoolboy hug
Its all right
Its all right
And its all your doing
I want to do the worst kind of penancebell and candle and the rest
Ive been through it with HER and now she hands me on to you and youre to call me any names you please
He freed her with his happy laugh
Im to be stood in the corner till next week and then Im to go up to see her
And she says I owe it all to you
To me
It was the first phrase she found to clutch at as she tried to steady herself in the eddies of his joy
Yes you were so patient and so dear to her and you saw at once what a damned ass Id been
She tried a smile and it seemed to pass muster with him for he sent it back in a broad beam
Thats not so difficult to see
No I admit it doesnt take a microscope
But you were so wise and wonderfulyou always are
Ive been mad these last days simply madyou and she might well have washed your hands of me
And instead its all rightall right
She drew back a little trying to keep the smile on her lips and not let him get the least glimpse of what it hid
Now if ever indeed it behoved her to be wise and wonderful
Im so glad dear so glad
If only youll always feel like that about me She stopped hardly knowing what she said and aghast at the idea that her own hands should have retied the knot she imagined to be broken
But she saw he had something more to say something hard to get out but absolutely necessary to express
He caught her hands pulled her close and with his forehead drawn into its whimsical smiling wrinkles Look here he cried if Darrow wants to call me a damned ass too youre not to stop him
It brought her back to a sharper sense of her central peril of the secret to be kept from him at whatever cost to her racked nerves
Oh you know he doesnt always wait for orders
On the whole it sounded better than shed feared
You mean hes called me one already
He accepted the fact with his gayest laugh
Well that saves a lot of trouble now we can pass to the order of the day he broke off and glanced at the clockwhich is you know dear that shes starting in about an hour she and Adelaide must already be snatching a hasty sandwich
Youll come down to bid them goodbye
Yesof course
There had in fact grown upon her while he spoke the urgency of seeing Sophy Viner again before she left
The thought was deeply distasteful Anna shrank from encountering the girl till she had cleared a way through her own perplexities
But it was obvious that since they had separated barely an hour earlier the situation had taken a new shape
Sophy Viner had apparently reconsidered her decision to break amicably but definitely with Owen and stood again in their path a menace and a mystery and confused impulses of resistance stirred in Annas mind
She felt Owens touch on her arm
Are you coming
Yesyespresently
Whats the matter
You look so strange
What do you mean by strange
I dont know startledsurprised  She read what her look must be by its sudden reflection in his face
Do I
No wonder
Youve given us all an exciting morning
He held to his point
Youre more excited now that theres no cause for it
What on earth has happened since I saw you
He looked about the room as if seeking the clue to her agitation and in her dread of what he might guess she answered What has happened is simply that Im rather tired
Will you ask Sophy to come up and see me here
While she waited she tried to think what she should say when the girl appeared but she had never been more conscious of her inability to deal with the oblique and the tortuous
She had lacked the hard teachings of experience and an instinctive disdain for whatever was less clear and open than her own conscience had kept her from learning anything of the intricacies and contradictions of other hearts
She said to herself I must find out yet everything in her recoiled from the means by which she felt it must be done Sophy Viner appeared almost immediately dressed for departure her little bag on her arm
She was still pale to the point of haggardness but with a light upon her that struck Anna with surprise
Or was it perhaps that she was looking at the girl with new eyes seeing her for the first time not as Effies governess not as Owens bride but as the embodiment of that unknown peril lurking in the background of every womans thoughts about her lover
Anna at any rate with a sudden sense of estrangement noted in her graces and snares never before perceived
It was only the flash of a primitive instinct but it lasted long enough to make her ashamed of the darknesses it lit up in her heart She signed to Sophy to sit down on the sofa beside her
I asked you to come up to me because I wanted to say goodbye quietly she explained feeling her lips tremble but trying to speak in a tone of friendly naturalness
The girls only answer was a faint smile of acquiescence and Anna disconcerted by her silence went on Youve decided then not to break your engagement
Sophy Viner raised her head with a look of surprise
Evidently the question thus abruptly put must have sounded strangely on the lips of so ardent a partisan as Mrs Leath
I thought that was what you wished she said
What I wished
Annas heart shook against her side
I wish of course whatever seems best for OwenIts natural you must understand that that consideration should come first with me Sophy was looking at her steadily
I supposed it was the only one that counted with you
The curtness of retort roused Annas latent antagonism
It is she said in a hard voice that startled her as she heard it
Had she ever spoken so to any one before
She felt frightened as though her very nature had changed without her knowing itFeeling the girls astonished gaze still on her she continued The suddenness of the change has naturally surprised me
When I left you it was understood that you were to reserve your decision Yes
And now
Anna waited for a reply that did not come
She did not understand the girls attitude the edge of irony in her short syllables the plainly premeditated determination to lay the burden of proof on her interlocutor
Anna felt the sudden need to lift their intercourse above this mean level of defiance and distrust
She looked appealingly at Sophy
Isnt it best that we should speak quite frankly
Its this change on your part that perplexes me
You can hardly be surprised at that
Its true I asked you not to break with Owen too abruptlyand I asked it believe me as much for your sake as for his I wanted you to take time to think over the difficulty that seems to have arisen between you
The fact that you felt it required thinking over seemed to show you wouldnt take the final step lightlywouldnt I mean accept of Owen more than you could give him
But your change of mind obliges me to ask the question I thought you would have asked yourself
Is there any reason why you shouldnt marry Owen
She stopped a little breathlessly her eyes on Sophy Viners burning face
Any reason
What do you mean by a reason
Anna continued to look at her gravely
Do you love some one else
she asked
Sophys first look was one of wonder and a faint relief then she gave back the others scrutiny in a glance of indescribable reproach
Ah you might have waited
she exclaimed
Waited
Till Id gone till I was out of the house
You might have knownyou might have guessed She turned her eyes again on Anna
I only meant to let him hope a little longer so that he shouldnt suspect anything of course I cant marry him she said
Anna stood motionless silenced by the shock of the avowal
She too was trembling less with anger than with a confused compassion
But the feeling was so blent with others less generous and more obscure that she found no words to express it and the two women faced each other without speaking
Id better go Sophy murmured at length with lowered head
The words roused in Anna a latent impulse of compunction
The girl looked so young so exposed and desolate
And what thoughts must she be hiding in her heart
It was impossible that they should part in such a spirit
I want you to know that no one said anythingIt was I who Sophy looked at her
You mean that Mr Darrow didnt tell you
Of course not do you suppose I thought he did
You found it out thats allI knew you would
In your place I should have guessed it sooner
The words were spoken simply without irony or emphasis but they went through Anna like a sword
Yes the girl would have had divinations promptings that she had not had
She felt half envious of such a sad precocity of wisdom
Im so sorryso sorry she murmured
Things happen that way
Now Id better go
Id like to say goodbye to Effie
Oh it broke in a cry from Effies mother
Not like thisyou mustnt
I feelyou make me feel too horribly as if I were driving you away The words had rushed up from the depths of her bewildered pity
No one is driving me away I had to go she heard the girl reply
There was another silence during which passionate impulses of magnanimity warred in Anna with her doubts and dreads
At length her eyes on Sophys face Yes you must go now she began but later onafter a while when all this is overif theres no reason why you shouldnt marry Owen  she paused a moment on the words I shouldnt want you to think I stood between you You
Sophy flushed again and then grew pale
She seemed to try to speak but no words came
Yes
It was not true when I said just now that I was thinking only of Owen
Im sorryoh so sorryfor you too
Your lifeI know how hard its been and minemines so fullHappy women understand best
Anna drew near and touched the girls hand then she began again pouring all her soul into the broken phrases Its terrible nowyou see no future but if by and byeyou know bestbut youre so youngand at your age things DO pass
If theres no reason no real reason why you shouldnt marry Owen I WANT him to hope Ill help him to hopeif you say so With the urgency of her pleading her clasp tightened on Sophys hand but it warmed to no responsive tremor the girl seemed numb and Anna was frightened by the stony silence of her look
I suppose Im not more than half a woman she mused for I dont want my happiness to hurt her and aloud she repeated If only youll tell me theres no reason The girl did not speak but suddenly like a snapped branch she bent stooped down to the hand that clasped her and laid her lips upon it in a stream of weeping
She cried silently continuously abundantly as though Annas touch had released the waters of some deep spring of pain then as Anna moved and half afraid leaned over her with a sound of pity she stood up and turned away
Youre going thenfor goodlike this
Anna moved toward her and stopped
Sophy stopped too with eyes that shrank from her
Oh Anna cried and hid her face
The girl walked across the room and paused again in the doorway
From there she flung back I wanted itI chose it
He was good to meno one ever was so good
The doorhandle turned and Anna heard her go
XXIX Her first thought was Hes going too in a few hoursI neednt see him again before he leaves At that moment the possibility of having to look in Darrows face and hear him speak seemed to her more unendurable than anything else she could imagine
Then on the next wave of feeling came the desire to confront him at once and wring from him she knew not what avowal denial justification anything that should open some channel of escape to the flood of her pent up anguish
She had told Owen she was tired and this seemed a sufficient reason for remaining upstairs when the motor came to the door and Miss Painter and Sophy Viner were borne off in it sufficient also for sending word to Madame de Chantelle that she would not come down till after luncheon
Having despatched her maid with this message she lay down on her sofa and stared before her into darkness She had been unhappy before and the vision of old miseries flocked like hungry ghosts about her fresh pain she recalled her youthful disappointment the failure of her marriage the wasted years that followed but those were negative sorrows denials and postponements of life
She seemed in no way related to their shadowy victim she who was stretched on this fiery rack of the irreparable
She had suffered beforeyes but lucidly reflectively elegiacally now she was suffering as a hurt animal must blindly furiously with the single fierce animal longing that the awful pain should stop She heard her maid knock and she hid her face and made no answer
The knocking continued and the discipline of habit at length made her lift her head compose her face and hold out her hand to the note the woman brought her
It was a word from DarrowMay I see you
and she said at once in a voice that sounded thin and empty Ask Mr Darrow to come up
The maid enquired if she wished to have her hair smoothed first and she answered that it didnt matter but when the door had closed the instinct of pride drew her to her feet and she looked at herself in the glass above the mantelpiece and passed her hands over her hair
Her eyes were burning and her face looked tired and thinner otherwise she could see no change in her appearance and she wondered that at such a moment her body should seem as unrelated to the self that writhed within her as if it had been a statue or a picture
The maid reopened the door to show in Darrow and he paused a moment on the threshold as if waiting for Anna to speak
He was extremely pale but he looked neither ashamed nor uncertain and she said to herself with a perverse thrill of appreciation Hes as proud as I am
Aloud she asked You wanted to see me
Naturally he replied in a grave voice
Dont
Its useless
I know everything
Nothing you can say will help
At the direct affirmation he turned even paler and his eyes which he kept resolutely fixed on her confessed his misery
You allow me no voice in deciding that
Deciding what
That theres nothing more to be said
He waited for her to answer and then went on I dont even know what you mean by everything
Oh I dont know what more there is
I know enough
I implored her to deny it and she couldntWhat can you and I have to say to each other
Her voice broke into a sob
The animal anguish was upon her againjust a blind cry against her pain
Darrow kept his head high and his eyes steady
It must be as you wish and yet its not like you to be afraid
Afraid
To talk things outto face them
Its for YOU to face thisnot me
All I ask is to face itbut with you
Once more he paused
Wont you tell me what Miss Viner told you
Oh shes generousto the utmost
The pain caught her like a physical throe
It suddenly came to her how the girl must have loved him to be so generouswhat memories there must be between them
Oh go please go
Its too horrible
Why should I have to see you
she stammered lifting her hands to her eyes
With her face hidden she waited to hear him move away to hear the door open and close again as a few hours earlier it had opened and closed on Sophy Viner
But Darrow made no sound or movement he too was waiting
Anna felt a thrill of resentment his presence was an outrage on her sorrow a humiliation to her pride
It was strange that he should wait for her to tell him so
You want me to leave Givre
he asked at length
She made no answer and he went on Of course Ill do as you wish but if I go now am I not to see you again
His voice was firm his pride was answering her pride
She faltered You must see its useless I might remind you that youre dismissing me without a hearing Without a hearing
Ive heard you both
but I wont he continued remind you of that or of anything or any one but Owen
Owen
Yes if we could somehow spare him She had dropped her hands and turned her startled eyes on him
It seemed to her an age since she had thought of Owen
You see dont you Darrow continued that if you send me away now She interrupted Yes I see and there was a long silence between them
At length she said very low I dont want any one else to suffer as Im suffering Owen knows I meant to leave tomorrow Darrow went on
Any sudden change of plan may make him think Oh she saw his inevitable logic the horror of it was on every side of her
It had seemed possible to control her grief and face Darrow calmly while she was upheld by the belief that this was their last hour together that after he had passed out of the room there would be no fear of seeing him again no fear that his nearness his look his voice and all the unseen influences that flowed from him would dissolve her soul to weakness
But her courage failed at the idea of having to conspire with him to shield Owen of keeping up with him for Owens sake a feint of union and felicity
To live at Darrows side in seeming intimacy and harmony for another twentyfour hours seemed harder than to live without him for all the rest of her days
Her strength failed her and she threw herself down and buried her sobs in the cushions where she had so often hidden a face aglow with happiness
Anna His voice was close to her
Let me talk to you quietly
Its not worthy of either of us to be afraid
Words of endearment would have offended her but her heart rose at the call to her courage
Ive no defense to make he went on
The facts are miserable enough but at least I want you to see them as they are
Above all I want you to know the truth about Miss Viner The name sent the blood to Annas forehead
She raised her head and faced him
Why should I know more of her than what shes told me
I never wish to hear her name again
Its because you feel about her in that way that I ask you in the name of common charityto let me give you the facts as they are and not as youve probably imagined them
Ive told you I dont think uncharitably of her
I dont want to think of her at all
Thats why I tell you youre afraid
Afraid
Yes
Youve always said you wanted above all to look at life at the human problem as it is without fear and without hypocrisy and its not always a pleasant thing to look at
He broke off and then began again Dont think this a plea for myself
I dont want to say a word to lessen my offense
I dont want to talk of myself at all
Even if I did I probably couldnt make you understandI dont myself as I look back
Be just to meits your right all I ask you is to be generous to Miss Viner She stood up trembling
Youre free to be as generous to her as you please
Yes youve made it clear to me that Im free
But theres nothing I can do for her that will help her half as much as your understanding her would
Nothing you can do for her
You can marry her
His face hardened
You certainly couldnt wish her a worse fate
It must have been what she expectedrelied onHe was silent and she broke out Or what is she
What are you
Its too horrible
On your way hereto ME She felt the tears in her throat and stopped
That was it he said bluntly
She stared at him
I was on my way to youafter repeated delays and postponements of your own making
At the very last you turned me back with a mere wordand without explanation
I waited for a letter and none came
Im not saying this to justify myself
Im simply trying to make you understand
I felt hurt and bitter and bewildered
I thought you meant to give me up
And suddenly in my way I found some one to be sorry for to be of use to
That I swear to you was the way it began
The rest was a moments follya flash of madnessas such things are
Weve never seen each other since Anna was looking at him coldly
You sufficiently describe her in saying that
Yes if you measure her by conventional standardswhich is what you always declare you never do
Conventional standards
A girl who She was checked by a sudden rush of almost physical repugnance
Suddenly she broke out I always thought her an adventuress
Always
I dont mean alwaysbut after you came Shes not an adventuress
You mean that she professes to act on the new theories
The stuff that awful women rave about on platforms
Oh I dont think she pretended to have a theory She hadnt even that excuse
She had the excuse of her loneliness her unhappinessof miseries and humiliations that a woman like you cant even guess
She had nothing to look back to but indifference or unkindnessnothing to look forward to but anxiety
She saw I was sorry for her and it touched her
She made too much of itshe exaggerated it
I ought to have seen the danger but I didnt
Theres no possible excuse for what I did
Anna listened to him in speechless misery
Every word he spoke threw back a disintegrating light on their own past
He had come to her with an open face and a clear conscience come to her from this
If his security was the security of falsehood it was horrible if it meant that he had forgotten it was worse
She would have liked to stop her ears to close her eyes to shut out every sight and sound and suggestion of a world in which such things could be and at the same time she was tormented by the desire to know more to understand better to feel herself less ignorant and inexpert in matters which made so much of the stuff of human experience
What did he mean by a moments folly a flash of madness
How did people enter on such adventures how pass out of them without more visible traces of their havoc
Her imagination recoiled from the vision of a sudden debasing familiarity it seemed to her that her thoughts would never again be pure I swear to you she heard Darrow saying it was simply that and nothing more
She wondered at his composure his competence at his knowing so exactly what to say
No doubt men often had to make such explanations they had the formulas by heartA leaden lassitude descended on her
She passed from flame and torment into a colourless cold world where everything surrounding her seemed equally indifferent and remote
For a moment she simply ceased to feel
She became aware that Darrow was waiting for her to speak and she made an effort to represent to herself the meaning of what he had just said but her mind was as blank as a blurred mirror
Finally she brought out I dont think I understand what youve told me
No you dont understand he returned with sudden bitterness and on his lips the charge of incomprehension seemed an offense to her
I dont want toabout such things
He answered almost harshly Dont be afraidyou never will and for an instant they faced each other like enemies
Then the tears swelled in her throat at his reproach
You mean I dont feel thingsIm too hard
No youre too hightoo finesuch things are too far from you
He paused as if conscious of the futility of going on with whatever he had meant to say and again for a short space they confronted each other no longer as enemiesso it seemed to herbut as beings of different language who had forgotten the few words they had learned of each others speech
Darrow broke the silence
Its best on all accounts that I should stay till tomorrow but I neednt intrude on you we neednt meet again alone
I only want to be sure I know your wishes
He spoke the short sentences in a level voice as though he were summing up the results of a business conference
Anna looked at him vaguely
My wishes
As to Owen At that she started
They must never meet again
Its not likely they will
What I meant was that it depends on you to spare him She answered steadily He shall never know and after another interval Darrow said This is goodbye then
At the word she seemed to understand for the first time whither the flying moments had been leading them
Resentment and indignation died down and all her consciousness resolved itself into the mere visual sense that he was there before her near enough for her to lift her hand and touch him and that in another instant the place where he stood would be empty
She felt a mortal weakness a craven impulse to cry out to him to stay a longing to throw herself into his arms and take refuge there from the unendurable anguish he had caused her
Then the vision called up another thought I shall never know what that girl has known and the recoil of pride flung her back on the sharp edges of her anguish
Goodbye she said in dread lest he should read her face and she stood motionless her head high while he walked to the door and went out
BOOK V XXX Anna Leath three days later sat in Miss Painters drawing room in the rue de Matignon
Coming up precipitately that morning from the country she had reached Paris at one oclock and Miss Painters landing some ten minutes later
Miss Painters mouldy little man servant dissembling a napkin under his arm had mildly attempted to oppose her entrance but Anna insisting had gone straight to the diningroom and surprised her friend who ate as furtively as certain animalsover a strange meal of cold mutton and lemonade
Ignoring the embarrassment she caused she had set forth the object of her journey and Miss Painter always hatted and booted for action had immediately hastened out leaving her to the solitude of the bare fireless drawingroom with its eternal slipcovers and bowed shutters
In this inhospitable obscurity Anna had sat alone for close upon two hours
Both obscurity and solitude were acceptable to her and impatient as she was to hear the result of the errand on which she had despatched her hostess she desired still more to be alone
During her long meditation in a whiteswathed chair before the muffled hearth she had been able for the first time to clear a way through the darkness and confusion of her thoughts
The way did not go far and her attempt to trace it was as weak and spasmodic as a convalescents first efforts to pick up the thread of living
She seemed to herself like some one struggling to rise from a long sickness of which it would have been so much easier to die
At Givre she had fallen into a kind of torpor a deadness of soul traversed by wild flashes of pain but whether she suffered or whether she was numb she seemed equally remote from her real living and doing self
It was only the discoverythat very morningof Owens unannounced departure for Paris that had caught her out of her dream and forced her back to action
The dread of what this flight might imply and of the consequences that might result from it had roused her to the sense of her responsibility and from the moment when she had resolved to follow her stepson and had made her rapid preparations for pursuit her mind had begun to work again feverishly fitfully but still with something of its normal order
In the train she had been too agitated too preoccupied with what might next await her to give her thoughts to anything but the turning over of dread alternatives but Miss Painters imperviousness had steadied her and while she waited for the sound of the latchkey she resolutely returned upon herself
With respect to her outward course she could at least tell herself that she had held to her purpose
She had as people said kept up during the twentyfour hours preceding George Darrows departure had gone with a calm face about her usual business and even contrived not too obviously to avoid him
Then the next day before dawn from behind the closed shutters where she had kept for half the night her dryeyed vigil she had heard him drive off to the train which brought its passengers to Paris in time for the Calais express
The fact of his taking that train of his travelling so straight and far away from her gave to what had happened the implacable outline of reality
He was gone he would not come back and her life had ended just as she had dreamed it was beginning
She had no doubt at first as to the absolute inevitability of this conclusion
The man who had driven away from her house in the autumn dawn was not the man she had loved he was a stranger with whom she had not a single thought in common
It was terrible indeed that he wore the face and spoke in the voice of her friend and that as long as he was under one roof with her the mere way in which he moved and looked could bridge at a stroke the gulf between them
That no doubt was the fault of her exaggerated sensibility to outward things she was frightened to see how it enslaved her
A day or two before she had supposed the sense of honour was her deepest sentiment if she had smiled at the conventions of others it was because they were too trivial not because they were too grave
There were certain dishonours with which she had never dreamed that any pact could be made she had had an incorruptible passion for good faith and fairness
She had supposed that once Darrow was gone once she was safe from the danger of seeing and hearing him this high devotion would sustain her
She had believed it would be possible to separate the image of the man she had thought him from that of the man he was
She had even foreseen the hour when she might raise a mournful shrine to the memory of the Darrow she had loved without fear that his doubles shadow would desecrate it
But now she had begun to understand that the two men were really one
The Darrow she worshipped was inseparable from the Darrow she abhorred and the inevitable conclusion was that both must go and she be left in the desert of a sorrow without memories
But if the future was thus void the present was all too full
Never had blow more complex repercussions and to remember Owen was to cease to think of herself
What impulse what apprehension had sent him suddenly to Paris
And why had he thought it needful to conceal his going from her
When Sophy Viner had left it had been with the understanding that he was to await her summons and it seemed improbable that he would break his pledge and seek her without leave unless his lovers intuition had warned him of some fresh danger
Anna recalled how quickly he had read the alarm in her face when he had rushed back to her sittingroom with the news that Miss Viner had promised to see him again in Paris
To be so promptly roused his suspicions must have been but halfasleep and since then no doubt if she and Darrow had dissembled so had he
To her proud directness it was degrading to think that they had been living together like enemies who spy upon each others movements she felt a desperate longing for the days which had seemed so dull and narrow but in which she had walked with her head high and her eyes unguarded
She had come up to Paris hardly knowing what peril she feared and still less how she could avert it
If Owen meant to see Miss Vinerand what other object could he havethey must already be together and it was too late to interfere
It had indeed occurred to Anna that Paris might not be his objective point that his real purpose in leaving Givre without her knowledge had been to follow Darrow to London and exact the truth of him
But even to her alarmed imagination this seemed improbable
She and Darrow to the last had kept up so complete a feint of harmony that whatever Owen had surmised he could scarcely have risked acting on his suspicions
If he still felt the need of an explanation it was almost certainly of Sophy Viner that he would ask it and it was in quest of Sophy Viner that Anna had despatched Miss Painter
She had found a blessed refuge from her perplexities in the stolid Adelaides unawareness
One could so absolutely count on Miss Painters guessing no more than one chose and yet acting astutely on such hints as one vouchsafed her
She was like a welltrained retriever whose interest in his prey ceases when he lays it at his masters feet
Anna on arriving had explained that Owens unannounced flight had made her fear some fresh misunderstanding between himself and Miss Viner
In the interests of peace she had thought it best to follow him but she hastily added that she did not wish to see Sophy but only if possible to learn from her where Owen was
With these brief instructions Miss Painter had started out but she was a woman of many occupations and had given her visitor to understand that before returning she should have to call on a friend who had just arrived from Boston and afterward despatch to another exiled compatriot a supply of cranberries and brandied peaches from the American grocery in the Champs Elysees
Gradually as the moments passed Anna began to feel the reaction which in moments of extreme nervous tension follows on any effort of the will
She seemed to have gone as far as her courage would carry her and she shrank more and more from the thought of Miss Painters return since whatever information the latter brought would necessitate some fresh decision
What should she say to Owen if she found him
What could she say that should not betray the one thing she would give her life to hide from him
Give her lifehow the phrase derided her
It was a gift she would not have bestowed on her worst enemy
She would not have had Sophy Viner live the hours she was living now She tried again to look steadily and calmly at the picture that the image of the girl evoked
She had an idea that she ought to accustom herself to its contemplation
If life was like that why the sooner one got used to it the betterBut no
Life was not like that
Her adventure was a hideous accident
She dreaded above all the temptation to generalise from her own case to doubt the high things she had lived by and seek a cheap solace in belittling what fate had refused her
There was such love as she had dreamed and she meant to go on believing in it and cherishing the thought that she was worthy of it
What had happened to her was grotesque and mean and miserable but she herself was none of these things and never never would she make of herself the mock that fate had made of her She could not as yet bear to think deliberately of Darrow but she kept on repeating to herself By and bye that will come too
Even now she was determined not to let his image be distorted by her suffering
As soon as she could she would try to single out for remembrance the individual things she had liked in him before she had loved him altogether
No spiritual exercise devised by the discipline of piety could have been more torturing but its very cruelty attracted her
She wanted to wear herself out with new pains XXXI The sound of Miss Painters latchkey made her start
She was still a bundle of quivering fears to whom each coming moment seemed a menace
There was a slight interval and a sound of voices in the hall then Miss Painters vigorous hand was on the door
Anna stood up as she came in
Youve found him
Ive found Sophy
And Owenhas she seen him
Is he here
SHES here in the hall
She wants to speak to you
HereNOW
Anna found no voice for more
She drove back with me Miss Painter continued in the tone of impartial narrative
The cabman was impertinent
Ive got his number
She fumbled in a stout black reticule
Oh I cant broke from Anna but she collected herself remembering that to betray her unwillingness to see the girl was to risk revealing much more
She thought you might be too tired to see her she wouldnt come in till Id found out
Anna drew a quick breath
An instants thought had told her that Sophy Viner would hardly have taken such a step unless something more important had happened
Ask her to come please she said
Miss Painter from the threshold turned back to announce her intention of going immediately to the police station to report the cabmans delinquency then she passed out and Sophy Viner entered
The look in the girls face showed that she had indeed come unwillingly yet she seemed animated by an eager resoluteness that made Anna ashamed of her tremors
For a moment they looked at each other in silence as if the thoughts between them were packed too thick for speech then Anna said in a voice from which she strove to take the edge of hardness You know where Owen is Miss Painter tells me
Yes that was my reason for asking you to see me
Sophy spoke simply without constraint or hesitation
I thought hed promised you Anna interposed
He did but he broke his promise
Thats what I thought I ought to tell you
Thank you
Anna went on tentatively He left Givre this morning without a word
I followed him because I was afraid She broke off again and the girl took up her phrase
You were afraid hed guessed
He HAS What do you meanguessed what
That you know something he doesntsomething that made you glad to have me go
Oh Anna moaned
If she had wanted more pain she had it now
Hes told you this
she faltered
He hasnt told me because I havent seen him
I kept him offI made Mrs Farlow get rid of him
But hes written me what he came to say and that was it
Oh poor Owen
broke from Anna
Through all the intricacies of her suffering she felt the separate pang of his
And I want to ask you the girl continued to let me see him for of course she added in the same strange voice of energy I wouldnt unless you consented
To see him
Anna tried to gather together her startled thoughts
What use would it be
What could you tell him
I want to tell him the truth said Sophy Viner
The two women looked at each other and a burning blush rose to Annas forehead
I dont understand she faltered
Sophy waited a moment then she lowered her voice to say I dont want him to think worse of me than he need Worse
Yesto think such things as youre thinking nowI want him to know exactly what happenedthen I want to bid him goodbye
Anna tried to clear a way through her own wonder and confusion
She felt herself obscurely moved
Wouldnt it be worse for him
To hear the truth
It would be better at any rate for you and Mr
Darrow
At the sound of the name Anna lifted her head quickly
Ive only my stepson to consider
The girl threw a startled look at her
You dont mean youre not going to give him up
Anna felt her lips harden
I dont think its of any use to talk of that
Oh I know
Its my fault for not knowing how to say what I want you to hear
Your words are different you know how to choose them
Mine offend youand the dread of it makes me blunder
Thats why the other day I couldnt say anythingcouldnt make things clear to you
But now MUST even if you hate it
She drew a step nearer her slender figure swayed forward in a passion of entreaty
Do listen to me
What youve said is dreadful
How can you speak of him in that voice
Dont you see that I went away so that he shouldnt have to lose you
Anna looked at her coldly
Are you speaking of Mr Darrow
I dont know why you think your going or staying can in any way affect our relations
You mean that you HAVE given him upbecause of me
Oh how could you
You cant really love himAnd yet the girl suddenly added you must or youd be more sorry for me
Im very sorry for you Anna said feeling as if the iron band about her heart pressed on it a little less inexorably
Then why wont you hear me
Why wont you try to understand
Its all so different from what you imagine
Ive never judged you
Im not thinking of myself
He loves you
I thought youd come to speak of Owen
Sophy Viner seemed not to hear her
Hes never loved any one else
Even those few daysI knew it all the whilehe never cared for me
Please dont say any more
Anna said
I know it must seem strange to you that I should say so much
I shock you I offend you you think me a creature without shame
So I ambut not in the sense you think
Im not ashamed of having loved him no and Im not ashamed of telling you so
Its that that justifies meand him tooOh let me tell you how it happened
He was sorry for me he saw I cared
I KNEW that was all he ever felt
I could see he was thinking of some one else
I knew it was only for a weekHe never said a word to mislead meI wanted to be happy just onceand I didnt dream of the harm I might be doing him
Anna could not speak
She hardly knew as yet what the girls words conveyed to her save the sense of their tragic fervour but she was conscious of being in the presence of an intenser passion than she had ever felt
I am sorry for you
She paused
But why do you say this to me
After another interval she exclaimed Youd no right to let Owen love you
No that was wrong
At least whats happened since has made it so
If things had been different I think I could have made Owen happy
You were all so good to meI wanted so to stay with you
I suppose youll say that makes it worse my daring to dream I had the rightBut all that doesnt matter now
I wont see Owen unless youre willing
I should have liked to tell him what Ive tried to tell you but you must know better you feel things in a finer way
Only youll have to help him if I cant
He cares a great dealits going to hurt him Anna trembled
Oh I know
What can I do
You can go straight back to Givrenow at once
So that Owen shall never know youve followed him
Sophys clasped hands reached out urgently
And you can send for Mr Darrowbring him back
Owen must be convinced that hes mistaken and nothing else will convince him
Afterward Ill find a pretextoh I promise you
But first he must see for himself that nothings changed for you
Anna stood motionless subdued and dominated
The girls ardour swept her like a wind
Oh cant I move you
Some day youll know
Sophy pleaded her eyes full of tears
Anna saw them and felt a fullness in her throat
Again the band about her heart seemed loosened
She wanted to find a word but could not all within her was too dark and violent
She gave the girl a speechless look
I do believe you she said suddenly then she turned and walked out of the room
XXXII She drove from Miss Painters to her own apartment
The maidservant who had it in charge had been apprised of her coming and had opened one or two of the rooms and prepared a fire in her bedroom
Anna shut herself in refusing the womans ministrations
She felt cold and faint and after she had taken off her hat and cloak she knelt down by the fire and stretched her hands to it
In one respect at least it was clear to her that she would do well to follow Sophy Viners counsel
It had been an act of folly to follow Owen and her first business was to get back to Givre before him
But the only train leaving that evening was a slow one which did not reach Francheuil till midnight and she knew that her taking it would excite Madame de Chantelles wonder and lead to interminable talk
She had come up to Paris on the pretext of finding a new governess for Effie and the natural thing was to defer her return till the next morning
She knew Owen well enough to be sure that he would make another attempt to see Miss Viner and failing that would write again and await her answer so that there was no likelihood of his reaching Givre till the following evening
Her sense of relief at not having to start out at once showed her for the first time how tired she was
The bonne had suggested a cup of tea but the dread of having any one about her had made Anna refuse and she had eaten nothing since morning but a sandwich bought at a buffet
She was too tired to get up but stretching out her arm she drew toward her the armchair which stood beside the hearth and rested her head against its cushions
Gradually the warmth of the fire stole into her veins and her heaviness of soul was replaced by a dreamy buoyancy
She seemed to be seated on the hearth in her sittingroom at Givre and Darrow was beside her in the chair against which she leaned
He put his arms about her shoulders and drawing her head back looked into her eyes
Of all the ways you do your hair thats the way I like best he said A log dropped and she sat up with a start
There was a warmth in her heart and she was smiling
Then she looked about her and saw where she was and the glory fell
She hid her face and sobbed
Presently she perceived that it was growing dark and getting up stiffly she began to undo the things in her bag and spread them on the dressingtable
She shrank from lighting the lights and groped her way about trying to find what she needed
She seemed immeasurably far off from every one and most of all from herself
It was as if her consciousness had been transmitted to some stranger whose thoughts and gestures were indifferent to her
Suddenly she heard a shrill tinkle and with a beating heart she stood still in the middle of the room
It was the telephone in her dressingrooma call no doubt from Adelaide Painter
Or could Owen have learned she was in town
The thought alarmed her and she opened the door and stumbled across the unlit room to the instrument
She held it to her ear and heard Darrows voice pronounce her name
Will you let me see you
Ive come backI had to come
Miss Painter told me you were here
She began to tremble and feared that he would guess it from her voice
She did not know what she answered she heard him say I cant hear
She called Yes
and laid the telephone down and caught it up againbut he was gone
She wondered if her Yes had reached him
She sat in her chair and listened
Why had she said that she would see him
What did she mean to say to him when he came
Now and then as she sat there the sense of his presence enveloped her as in her dream and she shut her eyes and felt his arms about her
Then she woke to reality and shivered
A long time elapsed and at length she said to herself He isnt coming
The doorbell rang as she said it and she stood up cold and trembling
She thought Can he imagine theres any use in coming
and moved forward to bid the servant say she could not see him
The door opened and she saw him standing in the drawing room
The room was cold and fireless and a hard glare fell from the walllights on the shrouded furniture and the white slips covering the curtains
He looked pale and stern with a frown of fatigue between his eyes and she remembered that in three days he had travelled from Givre to London and back
It seemed incredible that all that had befallen her should have been compressed within the space of three days
Thank you he said as she came in
She answered Its better I suppose He came toward her and took her in his arms
She struggled a little afraid of yielding but he pressed her to him not bending to her but holding her fast as though he had found her after a long search she heard his hurried breathing
It seemed to come from her own breast so close he held her and it was she who at last lifted up her face and drew down his
She freed herself and went and sat on a sofa at the other end of the room
A mirror between the shrouded window curtains showed her crumpled travelling dress and the white face under her disordered hair She found her voice and asked him how he had been able to leave London
He answered that he had managedhed arranged it and she saw he hardly heard what she was saying
I had to see you he went on and moved nearer sitting down at her side
Yes we must think of Owen Oh Owen
Her mind had flown back to Sophy Viners plea that she should let Darrow return to Givre in order that Owen might be persuaded of the folly of his suspicions
The suggestion was absurd of course
She could not ask Darrow to lend himself to such a fraud even had she had the inhuman courage to play her part in it
She was suddenly overwhelmed by the futility of every attempt to reconstruct her ruined world
No it was useless and since it was useless every moment with Darrow was pure pain Ive come to talk of myself not of Owen she heard him saying
When you sent me away the other day I understood that it couldnt be otherwisethen
But its not possible that you and I should part like that
If Im to lose you it must be for a better reason
A better reason
Yes a deeper one
One that means a fundamental disaccord between us
This one doesntin spite of everything it doesnt
Thats what I want you to see and have the courage to acknowledge
If I saw it I should have the courage
Yes courage was the wrong word
You have that
Thats why Im here
But I dont see it she continued sadly
So its useless isnt itand so cruel He was about to speak but she went on I shall never understand itnever
He looked at her
You will some day you were made to feel everything I should have thought this was a case of not feeling On my part you mean
He faced her resolutely
Yes it was to my shameWhat I meant was that when youve lived a little longer youll see what complex blunderers we all are how were struck blind sometimes and mad sometimesand then when our sight and our senses come back how we have to set to work and build up little by little bit by bit the precious things wed smashed to atoms without knowing it
Lifes just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits
She looked up quickly
Thats what I feel that you ought to He stood up interrupting her with a gesture
Oh dont dont say what youre going to
Men dont give their lives away like that
If you wont have mine its at least my own to do the best I can with
The best you canthats what I mean
How can there be a best for you thats made of some one elses worst
He sat down again with a groan
I dont know
It seemed such a slight thingall on the surfaceand Ive gone aground on it because it was on the surface
I see the horror of it just as you do
But I see a little more clearly the extent and the limits of my wrong
Its not as black as you imagine
She lowered her voice to say I suppose I shall never understand but she seems to love you Theres my shame
That I didnt guess it didnt fly from it
You say youll never understand but why shouldnt you
Is it anything to be proud of to know so little of the strings that pull us
If you knew a little more I could tell you how such things happen without offending you and perhaps youd listen without condemning me
I dont condemn you
She was dizzy with struggling impulses
She longed to cry out I DO understand
Ive understood ever since youve been here
For she was aware in her own bosom of sensations so separate from her romantic thoughts of him that she saw her body and soul divided against themselves
She recalled having read somewhere that in ancient Rome the slaves were not allowed to wear a distinctive dress lest they should recognize each other and learn their numbers and their power
So in herself she discerned for the first time instincts and desires which mute and unmarked had gone to and fro in the dim passages of her mind and now hailed each other with a cry of mutiny
Oh I dont know what to think
she broke out
You say you didnt know she loved you
But you know it now
Doesnt that show you how you can put the broken bits together
Can you seriously think it would be doing so to marry one woman while I care for another
Oh I dont knowI dont know The sense of her weakness made her try to harden herself against his arguments
You do know
Weve often talked of such things of the monstrousness of useless sacrifices
If Im to expiate its not in that way
He added abruptly Its in having to say this to you now She found no answer
Through the silent apartment they heard the sudden peal of the doorbell and she rose to her feet
Owen
she instantly exclaimed
Is Owen in Paris
She explained in a rapid undertone what she had learned from Sophy Viner
Shall I leave you
Darrow asked
Yesno She moved to the diningroom door with the halfformed purpose of making him pass out and then turned back
It may be Adelaide
They heard the outer door open and a moment later Owen walked into the room
He was pale with excited eyes as they fell on Darrow Anna saw his start of wonder
He made a slight sign of recognition and then went up to his step mother with an air of exaggerated gaiety
You furtive person
I ran across the omniscient Adelaide and heard from her that youd rushed up suddenly and secretly  He stood between Anna and Darrow strained questioning dangerously on edge
I came up to meet Mr Darrow Anna answered
His leaves been prolongedhes going back with me
The words seemed to have uttered themselves without her will yet she felt a great sense of freedom as she spoke them
The hard tension of Owens face changed to incredulous surprise
He looked at Darrow
The merest lucka colleague whose wife was illI came straight back she heard the latter tranquilly explaining
His selfcommand helped to steady her and she smiled at Owen
Well all go back together tomorrow morning she said as she slipped her arm through his
XXXIII Owen Leath did not go back with his stepmother to Givre
In reply to her suggestion he announced his intention of staying on a day or two longer in Paris
Anna left alone by the first train the next morning
Darrow was to follow in the afternoon
When Owen had left them the evening before Darrow waited a moment for her to speak then as she said nothing he asked her if she really wished him to return to Givre
She made a mute sign of assent and he added For you know that much as Im ready to do for Owen I cant do that for himI cant go back to be sent away again
Nono
He came nearer and looked at her and she went to him
All her fears seemed to fall from her as he held her
It was a different feeling from any she had known before confused and turbid as if secret shames and rancours stirred in it yet richer deeper more enslaving
She leaned her head back and shut her eyes beneath his kisses
She knew now that she could never give him up
Nevertheless she asked him the next morning to let her go back alone to Givre
She wanted time to think
She was convinced that what had happened was inevitable that she and Darrow belonged to each other and that he was right in saying no past folly could ever put them asunder
If there was a shade of difference in her feeling for him it was that of an added intensity
She felt restless insecure out of his sight she had a sense of incompleteness of passionate dependence that was somehow at variance with her own conception of her character
It was partly the consciousness of this change in herself that made her want to be alone
The solitude of her inner life had given her the habit of these hours of self examination and she needed them as she needed her morning plunge into cold water
During the journey she tried to review what had happened in the light of her new decision and of her sudden relief from pain
She seemed to herself to have passed through some fiery initiation from which she had emerged seared and quivering but clutching to her breast a magic talisman
Sophy Viner had cried out to her Some day youll know
and Darrow had used the same words
They meant she supposed that when she had explored the intricacies and darknesses of her own heart her judgment of others would be less absolute
Well she knew nowknew weaknesses and strengths she had not dreamed of and the deep discord and still deeper complicities between what thought in her and what blindly wanted
Her mind turned anxiously to Owen
At least the blow that was to fall on him would not seem to have been inflicted by her hand
He would be left with the impression that his breach with Sophy Viner was due to one of the ordinary causes of such disruptions though he must lose her his memory of her would not be poisoned
Anna never for a moment permitted herself the delusion that she had renewed her promise to Darrow in order to spare her stepson this last refinement of misery
She knew she had been prompted by the irresistible impulse to hold fast to what was most precious to her and that Owens arrival on the scene had been the pretext for her decision and not its cause yet she felt herself fortified by the thought of what she had spared him
It was as though a star she had been used to follow had shed its familiar ray on ways unknown to her
All through these meditations ran the undercurrent of an absolute trust in Sophy Viner
She thought of the girl with a mingling of antipathy and confidence
It was humiliating to her pride to recognize kindred impulses in a character which she would have liked to feel completely alien to her
But what indeed was the girl really like
She seemed to have no scruples and a thousand delicacies
She had given herself to Darrow and concealed the episode from Owen Leath with no more apparent sense of debasement than the vulgarest of adventuresses yet she had instantly obeyed the voice of her heart when it bade her part from the one and serve the other
Anna tried to picture what the girls life must have been what experiences what initiations had formed her
But her own training had been too different there were veils she could not lift
She looked back at her married life and its colourless uniformity took on an air of high restraint and order
Was it because she had been so incurious that it had worn that look to her
It struck her with amazement that she had never given a thought to her husbands past or wondered what he did and where he went when he was away from her
If she had been asked what she supposed he thought about when they were apart she would instantly have answered his snuffboxes
It had never occurred to her that he might have passions interests preoccupations of which she was absolutely ignorant
Yet he went up to Paris rather regularly ostensibly to attend sales and exhibitions or to confer with dealers and collectors
She tried to picture him straight trim beautifully brushed and varnished walking furtively down a quiet street and looking about him before he slipped into a doorway
She understood now that she had been cold to him what more likely than that he had sought compensations
All men were like that she supposedno doubt her simplicity had amused him
In the act of transposing Fraser Leath into a Don Juan she was pulled up by the ironic perception that she was simply trying to justify Darrow
She wanted to think that all men were like that because Darrow was like that she wanted to justify her acceptance of the fact by persuading herself that only through such concessions could women like herself hope to keep what they could not give up
And suddenly she was filled with anger at her blindness and then at her disastrous attempt to see
Why had she forced the truth out of Darrow
If only she had held her tongue nothing need ever have been known
Sophy Viner would have broken her engagement Owen would have been sent around the world and her own dream would have been unshattered
But she had probed insisted crossexamined not rested till she had dragged the secret to the light
She was one of the luckless women who always have the wrong audacities and who always know it Was it she Anna Leath who was picturing herself to herself in that way
She recoiled from her thoughts as if with a sense of demoniac possession and there flashed through her the longing to return to her old state of fearless ignorance
If at that moment she could have kept Darrow from following her to Givre she would have done so
But he came and with the sight of him the turmoil fell and she felt herself reassured rehabilitated
He arrived toward dusk and she motored to Francheuil to meet him
She wanted to see him as soon as possible for she had divined through the new insight that was in her that only his presence could restore her to a normal view of things
In the motor as they left the town and turned into the high road he lifted her hand and kissed it and she leaned against him and felt the currents flow between them
She was grateful to him for not saying anything and for not expecting her to speak
She said to herself He never makes a mistakehe always knows what to do and then she thought with a start that it was doubtless because he had so often been in such situations
The idea that his tact was a kind of professional expertness filled her with repugnance and insensibly she drew away from him
He made no motion to bring her nearer and she instantly thought that that was calculated too
She sat beside him in frozen misery wondering whether henceforth she would measure in this way his every look and gesture
Neither of them spoke again till the motor turned under the dark arch of the avenue and they saw the lights of Givre twinkling at its end
Then Darrow laid his hand on hers and said I know dear and the hardness in her melted
Hes suffering as I am she thought and for a moment the baleful fact between them seemed to draw them closer instead of walling them up in their separate wretchedness
It was wonderful to be once more reentering the doors of Givre with him and as the old house received them into its mellow silence she had again the sense of passing out of a dreadful dream into the reassurance of kindly and familiar things
It did not seem possible that these quiet rooms so full of the slowlydistilled accumulations of a fastidious taste should have been the scene of tragic dissensions
The memory of them seemed to be shut out into the night with the closing and barring of its doors
At the teatable in the oakroom they found Madame de Chantelle and Effie
The little girl catching sight of Darrow raced down the drawingrooms to meet him and returned in triumph on his shoulder
Anna looked at them with a smile
Effie for all her graces was chary of such favours and her mother knew that in according them to Darrow she had admitted him to the circle where Owen had hitherto ruled
Over the teatable Darrow gave Madame de Chantelle the explanation of his sudden return from England
On reaching London he told her he had found that the secretary he was to have replaced was detained there by the illness of his wife
The Ambassador knowing Darrows urgent reasons for wishing to be in France had immediately proposed his going back and awaiting at Givre the summons to relieve his colleague and he had jumped into the first train without even waiting to telegraph the news of his release
He spoke naturally easily in his usual quiet voice taking his tea from Effie helping himself to the toast she handed and stooping now and then to stroke the dozing terrier
And suddenly as Anna listened to his explanation she asked herself if it were true
The question of course was absurd
There was no possible reason why he should invent a false account of his return and every probability that the version he gave was the real one
But he had looked and spoken in the same way when he had answered her probing questions about Sophy Viner and she reflected with a chill of fear that she would never again know if he were speaking the truth or not
She was sure he loved her and she did not fear his insincerity as much as her own distrust of him
For a moment it seemed to her that this must corrupt the very source of love then she said to herself By and bye when I am altogether his we shall be so near each other that there will be no room for any doubts between us
But the doubts were there now one moment lulled to quiescence the next more torturingly alert
When the nurse appeared to summon Effie the little girl after kissing her grandmother entrenched herself on Darrows knee with the imperious demand to be carried up to bed and Anna while she laughingly protested said to herself with a pang Can I give her a father about whom I think such things
The thought of Effie and of what she owed to Effie had been the fundamental reason for her delays and hesitations when she and Darrow had come together again in England
Her own feeling was so clear that but for that scruple she would have put her hand in his at once
But till she had seen him again she had never considered the possibility of re marriage and when it suddenly confronted her it seemed for the moment to disorganize the life she had planned for herself and her child
She had not spoken of this to Darrow because it appeared to her a subject to be debated within her own conscience
The question then was not as to his fitness to become the guide and guardian of her child nor did she fear that her love for him would deprive Effie of the least fraction of her tenderness since she did not think of love as something measured and exhaustible but as a treasure perpetually renewed
What she questioned was her right to introduce into her life any interests and duties which might rob Effie of a part of her time or lessen the closeness of their daily intercourse
She had decided this question as it was inevitable that she should but now another was before her
Assuredly at her age there was no possible reason why she should cloister herself to bring up her daughter but there was every reason for not marrying a man in whom her own faith was not complete XXXIV When she woke the next morning she felt a great lightness of heart
She recalled her last awakening at Givre three days before when it had seemed as though all her life had gone down in darkness
Now Darrow was once more under the same roof with her and once more his nearness sufficed to make the looming horror drop away
She could almost have smiled at her scruples of the night before as she looked back on them they seemed to belong to the old ignorant timorous time when she had feared to look life in the face and had been blind to the mysteries and contradictions of the human heart because her own had not been revealed to her
Darrow had said You were made to feel everything and to feel was surely better than to judge
When she came downstairs he was already in the oakroom with Effie and Madame de Chantelle and the sense of reassurance which his presence gave her was merged in the relief of not being able to speak of what was between them
But there it was inevitably and whenever they looked at each other they saw it
In her dread of giving it a more tangible shape she tried to devise means of keeping the little girl with her and when the latter had been called away by the nurse found an excuse for following Madame de Chantelle upstairs to the purple sittingroom
But a confidential talk with Madame de Chantelle implied the detailed discussion of plans of which Anna could hardly yet bear to consider the vaguest outline the date of her marriage the relative advantages of sailing from London or Lisbon the possibility of hiring a habitable house at their new post and when these problems were exhausted the application of the same method to the subject of Owens future
His grandmother having no suspicion of the real reason of Sophy Viners departure had thought it extremely suitable of the young girl to withdraw to the shelter of her old friends roof in the hour of bridal preparation
This maidenly retreat had in fact impressed Madame de Chantelle so favourably that she was disposed for the first time to talk over Owens projects and as every human event translated itself for her into terms of social and domestic detail Anna had perforce to travel the same round again
She felt a momentary relief when Darrow presently joined them but his coming served only to draw the conversation back to the question of their own future and Anna felt a new pang as she heard him calmly and lucidly discussing it
Did such selfpossession imply indifference or insincerity
In that problem her mind perpetually revolved and she dreaded the one answer as much as the other
She was resolved to keep on her course as though nothing had happened to marry Darrow and never let the consciousness of the past intrude itself between them but she was beginning to feel that the only way of attaining to this state of detachment from the irreparable was once for all to turn back with him to its contemplation
As soon as this desire had germinated it became so strong in her that she regretted having promised Effie to take her out for the afternoon
But she could think of no pretext for disappointing the little girl and soon after luncheon the three set forth in the motor to show Darrow a chateau famous in the annals of the region
During their excursion Anna found it impossible to guess from his demeanour if Effies presence between them was as much of a strain to his composure as to hers
He remained imperturbably goodhumoured and appreciative while they went the round of the monument and she remarked only that when he thought himself unnoticed his face grew grave and his answers came less promptly
On the way back two or three miles from Givre she suddenly proposed that they should walk home through the forest which skirted that side of the park
Darrow acquiesced and they got out and sent Effie on in the motor
Their way led through a bit of sober French woodland flat as a faded tapestry but with gleams of live emerald lingering here and there among its browns and ochres
The luminous grey air gave vividness to its dying colours and veiled the distant glimpses of the landscape in soft uncertainty
In such a solitude Anna had fancied it would be easier to speak but as she walked beside Darrow over the deep soundless flooring of brown moss the words on her lips took flight again
It seemed impossible to break the spell of quiet joy which his presence laid on her and when he began to talk of the place they had just visited she answered his questions and then waited for what he should say nextNo decidedly she could not speak she no longer even knew what she had meant to say
The same experience repeated itself several times that day and the next
When she and Darrow were apart she exhausted herself in appeal and interrogation she formulated with a fervent lucidity every point in her imaginary argument
But as soon as she was alone with him something deeper than reason and subtler than shyness laid its benumbing touch upon her and the desire to speak became merely a dim disquietude through which his looks his words his touch reached her as through a mist of bodily pain
Yet this inertia was torn by wild flashes of resistance and when they were apart she began to prepare again what she meant to say to him
She knew he could not be with her without being aware of this inner turmoil and she hoped he would break the spell by some releasing word
But she presently understood that he recognized the futility of words and was resolutely bent on holding her to her own purpose of behaving as if nothing had happened
Once more she inwardly accused him of insensibility and her imagination was beset by tormenting visions of his pastHad such things happened to him before
If the episode had been an isolated accidenta moment of folly and madness as he had called itshe could understand or at least begin to understand for at a certain point her imagination always turned back but if it were a mere link in a chain of similar experiments the thought of it dishonoured her whole past Effie in the interregnum between governesses had been given leave to dine downstairs and Anna on the evening of Darrows return kept the little girl with her till long after the nurse had signalled from the drawingroom door
When at length she had been carried off Anna proposed a game of cards and after this diversion had drawn to its languid close she said goodnight to Darrow and followed Madame de Chantelle upstairs
But Madame de Chantelle never sat up late and the second evening with the amiably implied intention of leaving Anna and Darrow to themselves she took an earlier leave of them than usual
Anna sat silent listening to her small stiff steps as they minced down the hall and died out in the distance
Madame de Chantelle had broken her wooden embroidery frame and Darrow having offered to repair it had drawn his chair up to a table that held a lamp
Anna watched him as he sat with bent head and knitted brows trying to fit together the disjoined pieces
The sight of him so tranquilly absorbed in this trifling business seemed to give to the quiet room a perfume of intimacy to fill it with a sense of sweet familiar habit and it came over her again that she knew nothing of the inner thoughts of this man who was sitting by her as a husband might
The lamplight fell on his white forehead on the healthy brown of his cheek the backs of his thin sunburnt hands
As she watched the hands her sense of them became as vivid as a touch and she said to herself That other woman has sat and watched him as I am doing
She has known him as I have never known himPerhaps he is thinking of that now
Or perhaps he has forgotten it all as completely as I have forgotten everything that happened to me before he came He looked young active stored with strength and energy not the man for vain repinings or long memories
She wondered what she had to hold or satisfy him
He loved her now she had no doubt of that but how could she hope to keep him
They were so nearly of an age that already she felt herself his senior
As yet the difference was not visible outwardly at least they were matched but ill health or unhappiness would soon do away with this equality
She thought with a pang of bitterness He wont grow any older because he doesnt feel things and because he doesnt I SHALL And when she ceased to please him what then
Had he the tradition of faith to the spoken vow or the deeper piety of the unspoken dedication
What was his theory what his inner conviction in such matters
But what did she care for his convictions or his theories
No doubt he loved her now and believed he would always go on loving her and was persuaded that if he ceased to his loyalty would be proof against the change
What she wanted to know was not what he thought about it in advance but what would impel or restrain him at the crucial hour
She put no faith in her own arts she was too sure of having none
And if some beneficent enchanter had bestowed them on her she knew now that she would have rejected the gift
She could hardly conceive of wanting the kind of love that was a state one could be cozened into Darrow putting away the frame walked across the room and sat down beside her and she felt he had something special to say
Theyre sure to send for me in a day or two now he began
She made no answer and he continued Youll tell me before I go what day Im to come back and get you
It was the first time since his return to Givre that he had made any direct allusion to the date of their marriage and instead of answering him she broke out Theres something Ive been wanting you to know
The other day in Paris I saw Miss Viner
She saw him flush with the intensity of his surprise
You sent for her
No she heard from Adelaide that I was in Paris and she came
She came because she wanted to urge me to marry you
I thought you ought to know what she had done
Darrow stood up
Im glad youve told me
He spoke with a visible effort at composure
Her eyes followed him as he moved away
Is that all
he asked after an interval
It seems to me a great deal
Its what shed already asked me
His voice showed her how deeply he was moved and a throb of jealousy shot through her
Oh it was for your sake I know
He made no answer and she added Shes been exceedingly generousWhy shouldnt we speak of it
She had lowered her head but through her dropped lids she seemed to be watching the crowded scene of his face
Ive not shrunk from speaking of it
Speaking of her then I mean
It seems to me that if I could talk to you about her I should know better She broke off confused and he questioned What is it you want to know better
The colour rose to her forehead
How could she tell him what she scarcely dared own to herself
There was nothing she did not want to know no fold or cranny of his secret that her awakened imagination did not strain to penetrate but she could not expose Sophy Viner to the base fingerings of a retrospective jealousy nor Darrow to the temptation of belittling her in the effort to better his own case
The girl had been magnificent and the only worthy return that Anna could make was to take Darrow from her without a question if she took him at all She lifted her eyes to his face
I think I only wanted to speak her name
Its not right that we should seem so afraid of it
If I were really afraid of it I should have to give you up she said
He bent over her and caught her to him
Ah you cant give me up now
he exclaimed
She suffered him to hold her fast without speaking but the old dread was between them again and it was on her lips to cry out How can I help it when I AM so afraid
XXXV The next morning the dread was still there and she understood that she must snatch herself out of the torpor of the will into which she had been gradually sinking and tell Darrow that she could not be his wife
The knowledge came to her in the watches of a sleepless night when through the tears of disenchanted passion she stared back upon her past
There it lay before her her sole romance in all its paltry poverty the cheapest of cheap adventures the most pitiful of sentimental blunders
She looked about her room the room where for so many years if her heart had been quiescent her thoughts had been alive and pictured herself henceforth cowering before a throng of mean suspicions of unavowed compromises and concessions
In that moment of selfsearching she saw that Sophy Viner had chosen the better part and that certain renunciations might enrich where possession would have left a desert
Passionate reactions of instinct fought against these efforts of her will
Why should past or future coerce her when the present was so securely hers
Why insanely surrender what the other would after all never have
Her sense of irony whispered that if she sent away Darrow it would not be to Sophy Viner but to the first woman who crossed his pathas in a similar hour Sophy Viner herself had crossed itBut the mere fact that she could think such things of him sent her shuddering back to the opposite pole
She pictured herself gradually subdued to such a conception of life and love she pictured Effie growing up under the influence of the woman she saw herself becomingand she hid her eyes from the humiliation of the picture
They were at luncheon when the summons that Darrow expected was brought to him
He handed the telegram to Anna and she learned that his Ambassador on the way to a German cure was to be in Paris the next evening and wished to confer with him there before he went back to London
The idea that the decisive moment was at hand was so agitating to her that when luncheon was over she slipped away to the terrace and thence went down alone to the garden
The day was grey but mild with the heaviness of decay in the air
She rambled on aimlessly following under the denuded boughs the path she and Darrow had taken on their first walk to the river
She was sure he would not try to overtake her sure he would guess why she wished to be alone
There were moments when it seemed to double her loneliness to be so certain of his reading her heart while she was so desperately ignorant of his She wandered on for more than an hour and when she returned to the house she saw as she entered the hall that Darrow was seated at the desk in Owens study
He heard her step and looking up turned in his chair without rising
Their eyes met and she saw that his were clear and smiling
He had a heap of papers at his elbow and was evidently engaged in some official correspondence
She wondered that he could address himself so composedly to his task and then ironically reflected that such detachment was a sign of his superiority
She crossed the threshold and went toward him but as she advanced she had a sudden vision of Owen standing outside in the cold autumn dusk and watching Darrow and Sophy Viner as they faced each other across the lamplit deskThe evocation was so vivid that it caught her breath like a blow and she sank down helplessly on the divan among the piledup books
Distinctly at the moment she understood that the end had come
When he speaks to me I will tell him
she thought Darrow laying aside his pen looked at her for a moment in silence then he stood up and shut the door
I must go tomorrow early he said sitting down beside her
His voice was grave with a slight tinge of sadness
She said to herself He knows what I am feeling and now the thought made her feel less alone
The expression of his face was stern and yet tender for the first time she understood what he had suffered
She had no doubt as to the necessity of giving him up but it was impossible to tell him so then
She stood up and said Ill leave you to your letters
He made no protest but merely answered Youll come down presently for a walk
and it occurred to her at once that she would walk down to the river with him and give herself for the last time the tragic luxury of sitting at his side in the little pavilion
Perhaps she thought it will be easier to tell him there
It did not on the way home from their walk become any easier to tell him but her secret decision to do so before he left gave her a kind of factitious calm and laid a melancholy ecstasy upon the hour
Still skirting the subject that fanned their very faces with its flame they clung persistently to other topics and it seemed to Anna that their minds had never been nearer together than in this hour when their hearts were so separate
In the glow of interchanged love she had grown less conscious of that other glow of interchanged thought which had once illumined her mind
She had forgotten how Darrow had widened her world and lengthened out all her perspectives and with a pang of double destitution she saw herself alone among her shrunken thoughts
For the first time then she had a clear vision of what her life would be without him
She imagined herself trying to take up the daily round and all that had lightened and animated it seemed equally lifeless and vain
She tried to think of herself as wholly absorbed in her daughters development like other mothers she had seen but she supposed those mothers must have had stored memories of happiness to nourish them
She had had nothing and all her starved youth still claimed its due
When she went up to dress for dinner she said to herself Ill have my last evening with him and then before we say good night Ill tell him
This postponement did not seem unjustified
Darrow had shown her how he dreaded vain words how resolved he was to avoid all fruitless discussion
He must have been intensely aware of what had been going on in her mind since his return yet when she had attempted to reveal it to him he had turned from the revelation
She was therefore merely following the line he had traced in behaving till the final moment came as though there were nothing more to say That moment seemed at last to be at hand when at her usual hour after dinner Madame de Chantelle rose to go upstairs
She lingered a little to bid goodbye to Darrow whom she was not likely to see in the morning and her affable allusions to his prompt return sounded in Annas ear like the note of destiny
A cold rain had fallen all day and for greater warmth and intimacy they had gone after dinner to the oakroom shutting out the chilly vista of the farther drawingrooms
The autumn wind coming up from the river cried about the house with a voice of loss and separation and Anna and Darrow sat silent as if they feared to break the hush that shut them in
The solitude the firelight the harmony of soft hangings and old dim pictures wove about them a spell of security through which Anna felt far down in her heart the muffled beat of an inextinguishable bliss
How could she have thought that this last moment would be the moment to speak to him when it seemed to have gathered up into its flight all the scattered splendours of her dream
XXXVI Darrow continued to stand by the door after it had closed
Anna felt that he was looking at her and sat still disdaining to seek refuge in any evasive word or movement
For the last time she wanted to let him take from her the fulness of what the sight of her could give
He crossed over and sat down on the sofa
For a moment neither of them spoke then he said Tonight dearest I must have my answer
She straightened herself under the shock of his seeming to take the very words from her lips
Tonight
was all that she could falter
I must be off by the early train
There wont be more than a moment in the morning
He had taken her hand and she said to herself that she must free it before she could go on with what she had to say
Then she rejected this concession to a weakness she was resolved to defy
To the end she would leave her hand in his hand her eyes in his eyes she would not in their final hour together be afraid of any part of her love for him
Youll tell me tonight dear he insisted gently and his insistence gave her the strength to speak
Theres something I must ask you she broke out perceiving as she heard her words that they were not in the least what she had meant to say
He sat still waiting and she pressed on Do such things happen to men often
The quiet room seemed to resound with the long reverberations of her question
She looked away from him and he released her and stood up
I dont know what happens to other men
Such a thing never happened to me She turned her eyes back to his face
She felt like a traveller on a giddy path between a cliff and a precipice there was nothing for it now but to go on
Had ithad it begunbefore you met her in Paris
No a thousand times no
Ive told you the facts as they were
All the facts
He turned abruptly
What do you mean
Her throat was dry and the loud pulses drummed in her temples
I meanabout herPerhaps you knewknew things about herbeforehand
She stopped
The room had grown profoundly still
A log dropped to the hearth and broke there in a hissing shower
Darrow spoke in a clear voice
I knew nothing absolutely nothing he said
She had the answer to her inmost doubtto her last shameful unavowed hope
She sat powerless under her woe
He walked to the fireplace and pushed back the broken log with his foot
A flame shot out of it and in the upward glare she saw his pale face stern with misery
Is that all
he asked
She made a slight sign with her head and he came slowly back to her
Then is this to be goodbye
Again she signed a faint assent and he made no effort to touch her or draw nearer
You understand that I shant come back
He was looking at her and she tried to return his look but her eyes were blind with tears and in dread of his seeing them she got up and walked away
He did not follow her and she stood with her back to him staring at a bowl of carnations on a little table strewn with books
Her tears magnified everything she looked at and the streaked petals of the carnations their fringed edges and frail curled stamens pressed upon her huge and vivid
She noticed among the books a volume of verse he had sent her from England and tried to remember whether it was before or after She felt that he was waiting for her to speak and at last she turned to him
I shall see you tomorrow before you go He made no answer
She moved toward the door and he held it open for her
She saw his hand on the door and his seal ring in its setting of twisted silver and the sense of the end of all things came to her
They walked down the drawingrooms between the shadowy reflections of screens and cabinets and mounted the stairs side by side
At the end of the gallery a lamp brought out turbid gleams in the smoky battlepiece above it
On the landing Darrow stopped his room was the nearest to the stairs
Good night he said holding out his hand
As Anna gave him hers the springs of grief broke loose in her
She struggled with her sobs and subdued them but her breath came unevenly and to hide her agitation she leaned on him and pressed her face against his arm
Dontdont he whispered soothing her
Her troubled breathing sounded loudly in the silence of the sleeping house
She pressed her lips tight but could not stop the nervous pulsations in her throat and he put an arm about her and opening his door drew her across the threshold of his room
The door shut behind her and she sat down on the lounge at the foot of the bed
The pulsations in her throat had ceased but she knew they would begin again if she tried to speak
Darrow walked away and leaned against the mantelpiece
The redveiled lamp shone on his books and papers on the arm chair by the fire and the scattered objects on his dressingtable
A log glimmered on the hearth and the room was warm and faintly smokescented
It was the first time she had ever been in a room he lived in among his personal possessions and the traces of his daily usage
Every object about her seemed to contain a particle of himself the whole air breathed of him steeping her in the sense of his intimate presence
Suddenly she thought This is what Sophy Viner knewand with a torturing precision she pictured them alone in such a sceneHad he taken the girl to an hotelwhere did people go in such cases
Wherever they were the silence of night had been around them and the things he used had been strewn about the roomAnna ashamed of dwelling on the detested vision stood up with a confused impulse of flight then a wave of contrary feeling arrested her and she paused with lowered head
Darrow had come forward as she rose and she perceived that he was waiting for her to bid him good night
It was clear that no other possibility had even brushed his mind and the fact for some dim reason humiliated her
Why notwhy not
something whispered in her as though his forbearance his tacit recognition of her pride were a slight on other qualities she wanted him to feel in her
In the morning then
she heard him say
Yes in the morning she repeated
She continued to stand in the same place looking vaguely about the room
For once before they partedsince part they mustshe longed to be to him all that Sophy Viner had been but she remained rooted to the floor unable to find a word or imagine a gesture that should express her meaning
Exasperated by her helplessness she thought Dont I feel things as other women do
Her eye fell on a notecase she had given him
It was worn at the corners with the friction of his pocket and distended with thickly packed papers
She wondered if he carried her letters in it and she put her hand out and touched it
All that he and she had ever felt or seen their close encounters of word and look and the closer contact of their silences trembled through her at the touch
She remembered things he had said that had been like new skies above her head ways he had that seemed a part of the air she breathed
The faint warmth of her girlish love came back to her gathering heat as it passed through her thoughts and her heart rocked like a boat on the surge of its long long memories
Its because I love him in too many ways she thought and slowly she turned to the door
She was aware that Darrow was still silently watching her but he neither stirred nor spoke till she had reached the threshold
Then he met her there and caught her in his arms
Not tonightdont tell me tonight
he whispered and she leaned away from him closing her eyes for an instant and then slowly opening them to the flood of light in his
XXXVII Anna and Darrow the next day sat alone in a compartment of the Paris train
Anna when they entered it had put herself in the farthest corner and placed her bag on the adjoining seat
She had decided suddenly to accompany Darrow to Paris had even persuaded him to wait for a later train in order that they might travel together
She had an intense longing to be with him an almost morbid terror of losing sight of him for a moment when he jumped out of the train and ran back along the platform to buy a newspaper for her she felt as though she should never see him again and shivered with the cold misery of her last journey to Paris when she had thought herself parted from him forever
Yet she wanted to keep him at a distance on the other side of the compartment and as the train moved out of the station she drew from her bag the letters she had thrust in it as she left the house and began to glance over them so that her lowered lids should hide her eyes from him
She was his now his for life there could never again be any question of sacrificing herself to Effies welfare or to any other abstract conception of duty
Effie of course would not suffer Anna would pay for her bliss as a wife by redoubled devotion as a mother
Her scruples were not overcome but for the time their voices were drowned in the tumultuous rumour of her happiness
As she opened her letters she was conscious that Darrows gaze was fixed on her and gradually it drew her eyes upward and she drank deep of the passionate tenderness in his
Then the blood rose to her face and she felt again the desire to shield herself
She turned back to her letters and her glance lit on an envelope inscribed in Owens hand
Her heart began to beat oppressively she was in a mood when the simplest things seemed ominous
What could Owen have to say to her
Only the first page was covered and it contained simply the announcement that in the company of a young compatriot who was studying at the Beaux Arts he had planned to leave for Spain the following evening
He hasnt seen her then
was Annas instant thought and her feeling was a strange compound of humiliation and relief
The girl had kept her word lived up to the line of conduct she had set herself and Anna had failed in the same attempt
She did not reproach herself with her failure but she would have been happier if there had been less discrepancy between her words to Sophy Viner and the act which had followed them
It irritated her obscurely that the girl should have been so much surer of her power to carry out her purpose Anna looked up and saw that Darrows eyes were on the newspaper
He seemed calm and secure almost indifferent to her presence
Will it become a matter of course to him so soon
she wondered with a twinge of jealousy
She sat motionless her eyes fixed on him trying to make him feel the attraction of her gaze as she felt his
It surprised and shamed her to detect a new element in her love for him a sort of suspicious tyrannical tenderness that seemed to deprive it of all serenity
Finally he looked up his smile enveloped her and she felt herself his in every fibre his so completely and inseparably that she saw the vanity of imagining any other fate for herself
To give herself a countenance she held out Owens letter
He took it and glanced down the page his face grown grave
She waited nervously till he looked up
Thats a good plan the best thing that could happen he said a just perceptible shade of constraint in his tone
Oh yes she hastily assented
She was aware of a faint current of relief silently circulating between them
They were both glad that Owen was going that for a while he would be out of their way and it seemed to her horrible that so much of the stuff of their happiness should be made of such unavowed feelings I shall see him this evening she said wishing Darrow to feel that she was not afraid of meeting her stepson
Yes of course perhaps he might dine with you
The words struck her as strangely obtuse
Darrow was to meet his Ambassador at the station on the latters arrival and would in all probability have to spend the evening with him and Anna knew he had been concerned at the thought of having to leave her alone
But how could he speak in that careless tone of her dining with Owen
She lowered her voice to say Im afraid hes desperately unhappy
He answered with a tinge of impatience Its much the best thing that he should travel
Yesbut dont you feel She broke off
She knew how he disliked these idle returns on the irrevocable and her fear of doing or saying what he disliked was tinged by a new instinct of subserviency against which her pride revolted
She thought to herself He will see the change and grow indifferent to me as he did to HER and for a moment it seemed to her that she was reliving the experience of Sophy Viner
Darrow made no attempt to learn the end of her unfinished sentence
He handed back Owens letter and returned to his newspaper and when he looked up from it a few minutes later it was with a clear brow and a smile that irresistibly drew her back to happier thoughts
The train was just entering a station and a moment later their compartment was invaded by a commonplace couple preoccupied with the bestowal of bulging packages
Anna at their approach felt the possessive pride of the woman in love when strangers are between herself and the man she loves
She asked Darrow to open the window to place her bag in the net to roll her rug into a cushion for her feet and while he was thus busied with her she was conscious of a new devotion in his tone in his way of bending over her and meeting her eyes
He went back to his seat and they looked at each other like lovers smiling at a happy secret
Anna before going back to Givre had suggested Owens moving into her apartment but he had preferred to remain at the hotel to which he had sent his luggage and on arriving in Paris she decided to drive there at once
She was impatient to have the meeting over and glad that Darrow was obliged to leave her at the station in order to look up a colleague at the Embassy
She dreaded his seeing Owen again and yet dared not tell him so and to ensure his remaining away she mentioned an urgent engagement with her dressmaker and a long list of commissions to be executed for Madame de Chantelle
I shall see you tomorrow morning she said but he replied with a smile that he would certainly find time to come to her for a moment on his way back from meeting the Ambassador and when he had put her in a cab he leaned through the window to press his lips to hers
She blushed like a girl thinking half vexed half happy Yesterday he would not have done it and a dozen scarcely definable differences in his look and manner seemed all at once to be summed up in the boyish act
After all Im engaged to him she reflected and then smiled at the absurdity of the word
The next instant with a pang of selfreproach she remembered Sophy Viners cry I knew all the while he didnt care Poor thing oh poor thing
Anna murmured At Owens hotel she waited in a tremor while the porter went in search of him
Word was presently brought back that he was in his room and begged her to come up and as she crossed the hall she caught sight of his portmanteaux lying on the floor already labelled for departure
Owen sat at a table writing his back to the door and when he stood up the window was behind him so that in the rainy afternoon light his features were barely discernible
Dearestso youre really off
she said hesitating a moment on the threshold
He pushed a chair forward and they sat down each waiting for the other to speak
Finally she put some random question about his travellingcompanion a slow shy meditative youth whom he had once or twice brought down to Givre
She reflected that it was natural he should have given this uncommunicative comrade the preference over his livelier acquaintances and aloud she said Im so glad Fred Rempson can go with you
Owen answered in the same tone and for a few minutes their talk dragged itself on over a dry waste of commonplaces
Anna noticed that though ready enough to impart his own plans Owen studiously abstained from putting any questions about hers
It was evident from his allusions that he meant to be away for some time and he presently asked her if she would give instructions about packing and sending after him some winter clothes he had left at Givre
This gave her the opportunity to say that she expected to go back within a day or two and would attend to the matter as soon as she returned
She added I came up this morning with George who is going on to London tomorrow intending by the use of Darrows Christian name to give Owen the chance to speak of her marriage
But he made no comment and she continued to hear the name sounding on unfamiliarly between them
The room was almost dark and she finally stood up and glanced about for the lightswitch saying I cant see you dear
Oh dontI hate the light
Owen exclaimed catching her by the wrist and pushing her back into her seat
He gave a nervous laugh and added Im halfblind with neuralgia
I suppose its this beastly rain
Yes it will do you good to get down to Spain
She asked if he had the remedies the doctor had given him for a previous attack and on his replying that he didnt know what hed done with the stuff she sprang up offering to go to the chemists
It was a relief to have something to do for him and she knew from his Oh thankswould you
that it was a relief to him to have a pretext for not detaining her
His natural impulse would have been to declare that he didnt want any drugs and would be all right in no time and his acquiescence showed her how profoundly he felt the uselessness of their trying to prolong their talk
His face was now no more than a white blur in the dusk but she felt its indistinctness as a veil drawn over aching intensities of expression
He knowshe knows she said to herself and wondered whether the truth had been revealed to him by some corroborative fact or by the sheer force of divination
He had risen also and was clearly waiting for her to go and she turned to the door saying Ill be back in a moment
Oh dont come up again please
He paused embarrassed
I meanI may not be here
Ive got to go and pick up Rempson and see about some final things with him
She stopped on the threshold with a sinking heart
He meant this to be their leavetaking thenand he had not even asked her when she was to be married or spoken of seeing her again before she set out for the other side of the world
Owen
she cried and turned back
He stood mutely before her in the dimness
You havent told me how long youre to be gone
How long
Oh you seethats rather vagueI hate definite dates you know He paused and she saw he did not mean to help her out
She tried to say Youll be here for my wedding
but could not bring the words to her lips
Instead she murmured In six weeks I shall be going too and he rejoined as if he had expected the announcement and prepared his answer Oh by that time very likely At any rate I wont say goodbye she stammered feeling the tears beneath her veil
No no rather not
he declared but he made no movement and she went up and threw her arms about him
Youll write me wont you
Of course of course Her hands slipped down into his and for a minute they held each other dumbly in the darkness then he gave a vague laugh and said Its really time to light up
He pressed the electric button with one hand while with the other he opened the door and she passed out without daring to turn back lest the light on his face should show her what she feared to see
XXXVIII Anna drove to the chemists for Owens remedy
On the way she stopped her cab at a bookshop and emerged from it laden with literature
She knew what would interest Owen and what he was likely to have read and she had made her choice among the newest publications with the promptness of a discriminating reader
But on the way back to the hotel she was overcome by the irony of adding this mental panacea to the other
There was something grotesque and almost mocking in the idea of offering a judicious selection of literature to a man setting out on such a journey
He knowshe knows she kept on repeating and giving the porter the parcel from the chemists she drove away without leaving the books
She went to her apartment whither her maid had preceded her
There was a fire in the drawingroom and the teatable stood ready by the hearth
The stormy rain beat against the uncurtained windows and she thought of Owen who would soon be driving through it to the station alone with his bitter thoughts
She had been proud of the fact that he had always sought her help in difficult hours and now in the most difficult of all she was the one being to whom he could not turn
Between them henceforth there would always be the wall of an insurmountable silenceShe strained her aching thoughts to guess how the truth had come to him
Had he seen the girl and had she told him
Instinctively Anna rejected this conjecture
But what need was there of assuming an explicit statement when every breath they had drawn for the last weeks had been charged with the immanent secret
As she looked back over the days since Darrows first arrival at Givre she perceived that at no time had any one deliberately spoken or anything been accidentally disclosed
The truth had come to light by the force of its irresistible pressure and the perception gave her a startled sense of hidden powers of a chaos of attractions and repulsions far beneath the ordered surfaces of intercourse
She looked back with melancholy derision on her old conception of life as a kind of welllit and well policed suburb to dark places one need never know about
Here they were these dark places in her own bosom and henceforth she would always have to traverse them to reach the beings she loved best
She was still sitting beside the untouched teatable when she heard Darrows voice in the hall
She started up saying to herself I must tell him that Owen knows but when the door opened and she saw his face still lit by the same smile of boyish triumph she felt anew the uselessness of speakingHad he ever supposed that Owen would not know
Probably from the height of his greater experience he had seen long since that all that happened was inevitable and the thought of it at any rate was clearly not weighing on him now
He was already dressed for the evening and as he came toward her he said The Ambassadors booked for an official dinner and Im free after all
Where shall we dine
Anna had pictured herself sitting alone all the evening with her wretched thoughts and the fact of having to put them out of her mind for the next few hours gave her an immediate sensation of relief
Already her pulses were dancing to the tune of Darrows and as they smiled at each other she thought Nothing can ever change the fact that I belong to him
Where shall we dine
he repeated gaily and she named a wellknown restaurant for which she had once heard him express a preference
But as she did so she fancied she saw a shadow on his face and instantly she said to herself It was THERE he went with her
Oh no not there after all
she interrupted herself and now she was sure his colour deepened
Where shall it be then
She noticed that he did not ask the reason of her change and this convinced her that she had guessed the truth and that he knew she had guessed it
He will always know what I am thinking and he will never dare to ask me she thought and she saw between them the same insurmountable wall of silence as between herself and Owen a wall of glass through which they could watch each others faintest motions but which no sound could ever traverse
They drove to a restaurant on the Boulevard and there in their intimate corner of the serried scene the sense of what was unspoken between them gradually ceased to oppress her
He looked so lighthearted and handsome so ingenuously proud of her so openly happy at being with her that no other fact could seem real in his presence
He had learned that the Ambassador was to spend two days in Paris and he had reason to hope that in consequence his own departure for London would be deferred
He was exhilarated by the prospect of being with Anna for a few hours longer and she did not ask herself if his exhilaration were a sign of insensibility for she was too conscious of his power of swaying her moods not to be secretly proud of affecting his
They lingered for some time over the fruit and coffee and when they rose to go Darrow suggested that if she felt disposed for the play they were not too late for the second part of the programme at one of the smaller theatres
His mention of the hour recalled Owen to her thoughts
She saw his train rushing southward through the storm and in a corner of the swaying compartment his face white and indistinct as it had loomed on her in the rainy twilight
It was horrible to be thus perpetually paying for her happiness
Darrow had called for a theatrical journal and he presently looked up from it to say I hear the second play at the Athenee is amusing
It was on Annas lips to acquiesce but as she was about to speak she wondered if it were not at the Athenee that Owen had seen Darrow with Sophy Viner
She was not sure he had even mentioned the theatre but the mere possibility was enough to darken her sky
It was hateful to her to think of accompanying Darrow to places where the girl had been with him
She tried to reason away this scruple she even reminded herself with a bitter irony that whenever she was in Darrows arms she was where the girl had been before her but she could not shake off her superstitious dread of being with him in any of the scenes of the Parisian episode
She replied that she was too tired for the play and they drove back to her apartment
At the foot of the stairs she halfturned to wish him good night but he appeared not to notice her gesture and followed her up to her door
This is ever so much better than the theatre he said as they entered the drawingroom
She had crossed the room and was bending over the hearth to light the fire
She knew he was approaching her and that in a moment he would have drawn the cloak from her shoulders and laid his lips on her neck just below the gatheredup hair
These privileges were his and however deferently and tenderly he claimed them the joyous ease of his manner marked a difference and proclaimed a right
After the theatre they came home like this she thought and at the same instant she felt his hands on her shoulders and shrank back
Dontoh dont
she cried drawing her cloak about her
She saw from his astonished stare that her face must be quivering with pain
Anna
What on earth is the matter
Owen knows
she broke out with a confused desire to justify herself
Darrows countenance changed
Did he tell you so
What did he say
Nothing
I knew it from the things he didnt say
You had a talk with him this afternoon
Yes for a few minutes
I could see he didnt want me to stay
She had dropped into a chair and sat there huddled still holding her cloak about her shoulders
Darrow did not dispute her assumption and she noticed that he expressed no surprise
He sat down at a little distance from her turning about in his fingers the cigarcase he had drawn out as they came in
At length he said Had he seen Miss Viner
She shrank from the sound of the name
NoI dont think soIm sure he hadnt They remained silent looking away from one another
Finally Darrow stood up and took a few steps across the room
He came back and paused before her his eyes on her face
I think you ought to tell me what you mean to do
She raised her head and gave him back his look
Nothing I do can help Owen
No but things cant go on like this
He paused as if to measure his words
I fill you with aversion he exclaimed
She started up halfsobbing
Nooh no
Poor childyou cant see your face
She lifted her hands as if to hide it and turning away from him bowed her head upon the mantelshelf
She felt that he was standing a little way behind her but he made no attempt to touch her or come nearer
I know youve felt as Ive felt he said in a low voice that we belong to each other and that nothing can alter that
But other thoughts come and you cant banish them
Whenever you see me you rememberyou associate me with things you abhorYouve been generousimmeasurably
Youve given me all the chances a woman could but if its only made you suffer whats the use
She turned to him with a tearstained face
It hasnt only done that
Oh no
I knowThereve been moments He took her hand and raised it to his lips
Theyll be with me as long as I live
But I cant see you paying such a price for them
Im not worth what Im costing you
She continued to gaze at him through teardilated eyes and suddenly she flung out the question Wasnt it the Athenee you took her to that evening
AnnaAnna
Yes I want to know now to know everything
Perhaps that will make me forget
I ought to have made you tell me before
Wherever we go I imagine youve been there with herI see you together
I want to know how it began where you went why you left herI cant go on in this darkness any longer
She did not know what had prompted her passionate outburst but already she felt lighter freer as if at last the evil spell were broken
I want to know everything she repeated
Its the only way to make me forget
After she had ceased speaking Darrow remained where he was his arms folded his eyes lowered immovable
She waited her gaze on his face
Arent you going to tell me
No
The blood rushed to her temples
You wont
Why not
If I did do you suppose youd forget THAT
Oh she moaned and turned away from him
You see its impossible he went on
Ive done a thing I loathe and to atone for it you ask me to do another
What sort of satisfaction would that give you
It would put something irremediable between us
She leaned her elbow against the mantelshelf and hid her face in her hands
She had the sense that she was vainly throwing away her last hope of happiness yet she could do nothing think of nothing to save it
The conjecture flashed through her Should I be at peace if I gave him up
and she remembered the desolation of the days after she had sent him away and understood that that hope was vain
The tears welled through her lids and ran slowly down between her fingers
Goodbye she heard him say and his footsteps turned to the door
She tried to raise her head but the weight of her despair bowed it down
She said to herself This is the endhe wont try to appeal to me again and she remained in a sort of tranced rigidity perceiving without feeling the fateful lapse of the seconds
Then the cords that bound her seemed to snap and she lifted her head and saw him going
Why hes minehes mine
Hes no one elses
His face was turned to her and the look in his eyes swept away all her terrors
She no longer understood what had prompted her senseless outcry and the mortal sweetness of loving him became again the one real fact in the world
XXXIX Anna the next day woke to a humiliated memory of the previous evening
Darrow had been right in saying that their sacrifice would benefit no one yet she seemed dimly to discern that there were obligations not to be tested by that standard
She owed it at any rate as much to his pride as to hers to abstain from the repetition of such scenes and she had learned that it was beyond her power to do so while they were together
Yet when he had given her the chance to free herself everything had vanished from her mind but the blind fear of losing him and she saw that he and she were as profoundly and inextricably bound together as two trees with interwoven roots
For a long time she brooded on her plight vaguely conscious that the only escape from it must come from some external chance
And slowly the occasion shaped itself in her mind
It was Sophy Viner only who could save herSophy Viner only who could give her back her lost serenity
She would seek the girl out and tell her that she had given Darrow up and that step once taken there would be no retracing it and she would perforce have to go forward alone
Any pretext for action was a kind of anodyne and she despatched her maid to the Farlows with a note asking if Miss Viner would receive her
There was a long delay before the maid returned and when at last she appeared it was with a slip of paper on which an address was written and a verbal message to the effect that Miss Viner had left some days previously and was staying with her sister in a hotel near the Place de lEtoile
The maid added that Mrs Farlow on the plea that Miss Viners plans were uncertain had at first made some difficulty about giving this information and Anna guessed that the girl had left her friends roof and instructed them to withhold her address with the object of avoiding Owen
Shes kept faith with herself and I havent Anna mused and the thought was a fresh incentive to action
Darrow had announced his intention of coming soon after luncheon and the morning was already so far advanced that Anna still mistrustful of her strength decided to drive immediately to the address Mrs Farlow had given
On the way there she tried to recall what she had heard of Sophy Viners sister but beyond the girls enthusiastic report of the absent Lauras loveliness she could remember only certain vague allusions of Mrs Farlows to her artistic endowments and matrimonial vicissitudes
Darrow had mentioned her but once and in the briefest terms as having apparently very little concern for Sophys welfare and being at any rate too geographically remote to give her any practical support and Anna wondered what chance had brought her to her sisters side at this conjunction
Mrs Farlow had spoken of her as a celebrity in what line Anna failed to recall but Mrs Farlows celebrities were legion and the name on the slip of paperMrs McTarvie Birchdid not seem to have any definite association with fame
While Anna waited in the dingy vestibule of the Hotel Chicago she had so distinct a vision of what she meant to say to Sophy Viner that the girl seemed already to be before her and her heart dropped from all the height of its courage when the porter after a long delay returned with the announcement that Miss Viner was no longer in the hotel
Anna doubtful if she understood asked if he merely meant that the young lady was out at the moment but he replied that she had gone away the day before
Beyond this he had no information to impart and after a moments hesitation Anna sent him back to enquire if Mrs McTarvieBirch would receive her
She reflected that Sophy had probably pledged her sister to the same secrecy as Mrs Farlow and that a personal appeal to Mrs Birch might lead to less negative results
There was another long interval of suspense before the porter reappeared with an affirmative answer and a third while an exiguous and hesitating lift bore her up past a succession of shabby landings
When the last was reached and her guide had directed her down a winding passage that smelt of seagoing luggage she found herself before a door through which a strong odour of tobacco reached her simultaneously with the sounds of a suppressed altercation
Her knock was followed by a silence and after a minute or two the door was opened by a handsome young man whose ruffled hair and general air of creased disorder led her to conclude that he had just risen from a longlimbed sprawl on a sofa strewn with tumbled cushions
This sofa and a grand piano bearing a basket of faded roses a biscuittin and a devastated breakfast tray almost filled the narrow sittingroom in the remaining corner of which another man short swarthy and humble sat examining the lining of his hat
Anna paused in doubt but on her naming Mrs Birch the young man politely invited her to enter at the same time casting an impatient glance at the mute spectator in the background
The latter raising his eyes which were round and bulging fixed them not on the young man but on Anna whom for a moment he scrutinized as searchingly as the interior of his hat
Under his gaze she had the sense of being minutely catalogued and valued and the impression when he finally rose and moved toward the door of having been accepted as a better guarantee than he had had any reason to hope for
On the threshold his glance crossed that of the young man in an exchange of intelligence as full as it was rapid and this brief scene left Anna so oddly enlightened that she felt no surprise when her companion pushing an armchair forward sociably asked her if she wouldnt have a cigarette
Her polite refusal provoked the remark that he would if shed no objection and while he groped for matches in his loose pockets and behind the photographs and letters crowding the narrow mantelshelf she ventured another enquiry for Mrs Birch
Just a minute he smiled I think the masseurs with her
He spoke in a smooth denationalized English which like the look in his longlashed eyes and the promptness of his charming smile suggested a long training in all the arts of expediency
Having finally discovered a matchbox on the floor beside the sofa he lit his cigarette and dropped back among the cushions and on Annas remarking that she was sorry to disturb Mrs Birch he replied that that was all right and that she always kept everybody waiting
After this through the haze of his perpetually renewed cigarettes they continued to chat for some time of indifferent topics but when at last Anna again suggested the possibility of her seeing Mrs Birch he rose from his corner with a slight shrug and murmuring Shes perfectly hopeless lounged off through an inner door
Anna was still wondering when and in what conjunction of circumstances the muchmarried Laura had acquired a partner so conspicuous for his personal charms when the young man returned to announce She says its all right if you dont mind seeing her in bed
He drew aside to let Anna pass and she found herself in a dim untidy scented room with a pink curtain pinned across its single window and a lady with a great deal of fair hair and uncovered neck smiling at her from a pink bed on which an immense powderpuff trailed
You dont mind do you
He costs such a frightful lot that I cant afford to send him off Mrs Birch explained extending a thicklyringed hand to Anna and leaving her in doubt as to whether the person alluded to were her masseur or her husband
Before a reply was possible there was a convulsive stir beneath the pink expanse and something that resembled another powderpuff hurled itself at Anna with a volley of sounds like the popping of Lilliputian champagne corks
Mrs Birch flinging herself forward gasped out If youd just give him a caramelthere in that box on the dressingtableits the only earthly thing to stop him and when Anna had proffered this sop to her assailant and he had withdrawn with it beneath the bedspread his mistress sank back with a laugh
Isnt he a beauty
The Prince gave him to me down at Nice the other daybut hes perfectly awful she confessed beaming intimately on her visitor
In the roseate penumbra of the bedcurtains she presented to Annas startled gaze an odd chromolike resemblance to Sophy Viner or a suggestion rather of what Sophy Viner might with the years and in spite of the powderpuff become
Larger blonder heavier featured she yet had glances and movements that disturbingly suggested what was freshest and most engaging in the girl and as she stretched her bare plump arm across the bed she seemed to be pulling back the veil from dingy distances of family history
Do sit down if theres a place to sit on she cordially advised adding as Anna took the edge of a chair hung with miscellaneous raiment My singing takes so much time that I dont get a chance to walk the fat offthats the worst of being an artist
Anna murmured an assent
I hope it hasnt inconvenienced you to see me I told Mr Birch Mr
WHO
the recumbent beauty asked and then Oh JIMMY
she faintly laughed as if more for her own enlightenment than Annas
The latter continued eagerly I understand from Mrs Farlow that your sister was with you and I ventured to come up because I wanted to ask you when I should have a chance of finding her
Mrs McTarvieBirch threw back her head with a long stare
Do you mean to say the idiot at the door didnt tell you
Sophy went away last night
Last night
Anna echoed
A sudden terror had possessed her
Could it be that the girl had tricked them all and gone with Owen
The idea was incredible yet it took such hold of her that she could hardly steady her lips to say The porter did tell me but I thought perhaps he was mistaken
Mrs Farlow seemed to think that I should find her here
It was all so sudden that I dont suppose she had time to let the Farlows know
She didnt get Mrs Murretts wire till yesterday and she just pitched her things into a trunk and rushed Mrs
Murrett
Why yes
Sophys gone to India with Mrs Murrett theyre to meet at Brindisi Sophys sister said with a calm smile
Anna sat motionless gazing at the disordered room the pink bed the trivial face among the pillows
Mrs McTarvieBirch pursued They had a fearful kickup last springI daresay you knew about itbut I told Sophy shed better lump it as long as the old woman was willing toAs an artist of course its perfectly impossible for me to have her with me Of course Anna mechanically assented
Through the confused pain of her thoughts she was hardly aware that Mrs Birchs explanations were still continuing
Naturally I didnt altogether approve of her going back to that beast of a woman
I said all I couldI told her she was a fool to chuck up such a place as yours
But Sophys restlessalways wasand shes taken it into her head shed rather travel Anna rose from her seat groping for some formula of leave taking
The pushing back of her chair roused the white dogs smouldering animosity and he drowned his mistresss further confidences in another outburst of hysterics
Through the tumult Anna signed an inaudible farewell and Mrs Birch having momentarily succeeded in suppressing her pet under a pillow called out Do come again
Id love to sing to you
Anna murmured a word of thanks and turned to the door
As she opened it she heard her hostess crying after her Jimmy
Do you hear me
Jimmy BRANCE
and then there being no response from the person summoned DO tell him he must go and call the lift for you
