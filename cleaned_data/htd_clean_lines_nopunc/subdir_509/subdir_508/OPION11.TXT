O Pioneers
by Willa Cather PART I The Wild Land I One January day thirty years ago the little town of Hanover anchored on a windy Ne braska tableland was trying not to be blown away
A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie under a gray sky
The dwellinghouses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight and others as if they were straying off by themselves headed straight for the open plain
None of them had any appearance of permanence and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them
The main street was a deeply rutted road now frozen hard which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain elevator at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end
On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings the general merchandise stores the two banks the drug store the feed store the saloon the postoffice
The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow but at two oclock in the afternoon the shopkeepers hav ing come back from dinner were keeping well behind their frosty windows
The children were all in school and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few roughlooking country men in coarse overcoats with their long caps pulled down to their noses
Some of them had brought their wives to town and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another
At the hitchbars along the street a few heavy workhorses har nessed to farm wagons shivered under their blankets
About the station everything was quiet for there would not be another train in until night
On the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy crying bitterly
He was about five years old
His black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man
His shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy coppertoed shoes
His cap was pulled down over his ears his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold
He cried quietly and the few people who hurried by did not notice him
He was afraid to stop any one afraid to go into the store and ask for help so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him whimpering My kitten oh my kitten
Her will fweeze
At the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws
The boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctors office and in her absence a dog had chased his kit ten up the pole
The little creature had never been so high before and she was too frightened to move
Her master was sunk in despair
He was a little country boy and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts
He always felt shy and awkward here and wanted to hide behind things for fear some one might laugh at him
Just now he was too un happy to care who laughed
At last he seemed to see a ray of hope his sister was coming and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes
His sister was a tall strong girl and she walked rapidly and resolutely as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next
She wore a mans long ulster not as if it were an affliction but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her carried it like a young soldier and a round plush cap tied down with a thick veil
She had a serious thoughtful face and her clear deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance without seeming to see anything as if she were in trouble
She did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat
Then she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face
Why Emil
I told you to stay in the store and not to come out
What is the matter with you
My kitten sister my kitten
A man put her out and a dog chased her up there
His forefinger projecting from the sleeve of his coat pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole
Oh Emil
Didnt I tell you shed get us into trouble of some kind if you brought her
What made you tease me so
But there I ought to have known better myself
She went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms crying Kitty kitty kitty but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail
Alex andra turned away decidedly
No she wont come down
Somebody will have to go up after her
I saw the Linstrums wagon in town
Ill go and see if I can find Carl
Maybe he can do something
Only you must stop crying or I wont go a step
Wheres your comforter
Did you leave it in the store
Never mind
Hold still till I put this on you
She unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat
A shabby little traveling man who was just then coming out of the store on his way to the saloon stopped and gazed stupidly at the shining mass of hair she bared when she took off her veil two thick braids pinned about her head in the German way with a fringe of reddishyellow curls blow ing out from under her cap
He took his cigar out of his mouth and held the wet end between the fingers of his woolen glove
My God girl what a head of hair
he exclaimed quite innocently and foolishly
She stabbed him with a glance of Amazonian fierceness and drew in her lower lipmost unnecessary severity
It gave the little clothing drummer such a start that he actually let his cigar fall to the side walk and went off weakly in the teeth of the wind to the saloon
His hand was still unsteady when he took his glass from the bartender
His feeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before but never so mercilessly
He felt cheap and illused as if some one had taken advan tage of him
When a drummer had been knock ing about in little drab towns and crawling across the wintry country in dirty smoking cars was he to be blamed if when he chanced upon a fine human creature he suddenly wished himself more of a man
While the little drummer was drinking to recover his nerve Alexandra hurried to the drug store as the most likely place to find Carl Linstrum
There he was turning over a port folio of chromo studies which the druggist sold to the Hanover women who did china painting
Alexandra explained her predica ment and the boy followed her to the corner where Emil still sat by the pole
Ill have to go up after her Alexandra
I think at the depot they have some spikes I can strap on my feet
Wait a minute
Carl thrust his hands into his pockets lowered his head and darted up the street against the north wind
He was a tall boy of fifteen slight and narrowchested
When he came back with the spikes Alexandra asked him what he had done with his overcoat
I left it in the drug store
I couldnt climb in it anyhow
Catch me if I fall Emil he called back as he began his ascent
Alexandra watched him anxiously the cold was bitter enough on the ground
The kitten would not budge an inch
Carl had to go to the very top of the pole and then had some difficulty in tear ing her from her hold
When he reached the ground he handed the cat to her tearful little master
Now go into the store with her Emil and get warm
He opened the door for the child
Wait a minute Alexandra
Why cant I drive for you as far as our place
Its get ting colder every minute
Have you seen the doctor
Yes
He is coming over tomorrow
But he says father cant get better cant get well
The girls lip trembled
She looked fixedly up the bleak street as if she were gathering her strength to face something as if she were try ing with all her might to grasp a situation which no matter how painful must be met and dealt with somehow
The wind flapped the skirts of her heavy coat about her
Carl did not say anything but she felt his sympathy
He too was lonely
He was a thin frail boy with brooding dark eyes very quiet in all his movements
There was a delicate pallor in his thin face and his mouth was too sensitive for a boys
The lips had already a little curl of bitterness and skepticism
The two friends stood for a few moments on the windy street corner not speaking a word as two travelers who have lost their way sometimes stand and admit their perplexity in silence
When Carl turned away he said Ill see to your team
Alexandra went into the store to have her pur chases packed in the eggboxes and to get warm before she set out on her long cold drive
When she looked for Emil she found him sit ting on a step of the staircase that led up to the clothing and carpet department
He was play ing with a little Bohemian girl Marie Tovesky who was tying her handkerchief over the kit tens head for a bonnet
Marie was a stranger in the country having come from Omaha with her mother to visit her uncle Joe Tovesky
She was a dark child with brown curly hair like a brunette dolls a coaxing little red mouth and round yellowbrown eyes
Every one noticed her eyes the brown iris had golden glints that made them look like goldstone or in softer lights like that Colorado mineral called tigereye
The country children thereabouts wore their dresses to their shoetops but this city child was dressed in what was then called the Kate Greenaway manner and her red cashmere frock gathered full from the yoke came almost to the floor
This with her poke bonnet gave her the look of a quaint little woman
She had a white fur tippet about her neck and made no fussy objections when Emil fingered it admiringly
Alexandra had not the heart to take him away from so pretty a playfellow and she let them tease the kitten together until Joe Tovesky came in noisily and picked up his little niece setting her on his shoulder for every one to see
His children were all boys and he adored this little creature
His cronies formed a circle about him admiring and teasing the little girl who took their jokes with great good nature
They were all delighted with her for they seldom saw so pretty and carefully nur tured a child
They told her that she must choose one of them for a sweetheart and each began pressing his suit and offering her bribes candy and little pigs and spotted calves
She looked archly into the big brown mustached faces smelling of spirits and tobacco then she ran her tiny forefinger delicately over Joes bristly chin and said Here is my sweetheart
The Bohemians roared with laughter and Maries uncle hugged her until she cried Please dont Uncle Joe
You hurt me
Each of Joes friends gave her a bag of candy and she kissed them all around though she did not like coun try candy very well
Perhaps that was why she bethought herself of Emil
Let me down Uncle Joe she said I want to give some of my candy to that nice little boy I found
She walked graciously over to Emil followed by her lusty admirers who formed a new circle and teased the little boy until he hid his face in his sisters skirts and she had to scold him for being such a baby
The farm people were making preparations to start for home
The women were checking over their groceries and pinning their big red shawls about their heads
The men were buy ing tobacco and candy with what money they had left were showing each other new boots and gloves and blue flannel shirts
Three big Bohemians were drinking raw alcohol tinctured with oil of cinnamon
This was said to fortify one effectually against the cold and they smacked their lips after each pull at the flask
Their volubility drowned every other noise in the place and the overheated store sounded of their spirited language as it reeked of pipe smoke damp woolens and kerosene
Carl came in wearing his overcoat and carry ing a wooden box with a brass handle
Come he said Ive fed and watered your team and the wagon is ready
He carried Emil out and tucked him down in the straw in the wagon box
The heat had made the little boy sleepy but he still clung to his kitten
You were awful good to climb so high and get my kitten Carl
When I get big Ill climb and get little boys kittens for them he mur mured drowsily
Before the horses were over the first hill Emil and his cat were both fast asleep
Although it was only four oclock the winter day was fading
The road led southwest toward the streak of pale watery light that glimmered in the leaden sky
The light fell upon the two sad young faces that were turned mutely toward it upon the eyes of the girl who seemed to be looking with such anguished perplexity into the future upon the sombre eyes of the boy who seemed already to be looking into the past
The little town behind them had vanished as if it had never been had fallen behind the swell of the prairie and the stern frozen country received them into its bosom
The homesteads were few and far apart here and there a wind mill gaunt against the sky a sod house crouch ing in a hollow
But the great fact was the land itself which seemed to overwhelm the little beginnings of human society that struggled in its sombre wastes
It was from facing this vast hardness that the boys mouth had become so bitter because he felt that men were too weak to make any mark here that the land wanted to be let alone to preserve its own fierce strength its peculiar savage kind of beauty its uninterrupted mournfulness
The wagon jolted along over the frozen road
The two friends had less to say to each other than usual as if the cold had somehow pene trated to their hearts
Did Lou and Oscar go to the Blue to cut wood today
Carl asked
Yes
Im almost sorry I let them go its turned so cold
But mother frets if the wood gets low
She stopped and put her hand to her forehead brushing back her hair
I dont know what is to become of us Carl if father has to die
I dont dare to think about it
I wish we could all go with him and let the grass grow back over everything
Carl made no reply
Just ahead of them was the Norwegian graveyard where the grass had indeed grown back over everything shaggy and red hiding even the wire fence
Carl real ized that he was not a very helpful companion but there was nothing he could say
Of course Alexandra went on steadying her voice a little the boys are strong and work hard but weve always depended so on father that I dont see how we can go ahead
I almost feel as if there were nothing to go ahead for
Does your father know
Yes I think he does
He lies and counts on his fingers all day
I think he is trying to count up what he is leaving for us
Its a com fort to him that my chickens are laying right on through the cold weather and bringing in a little money
I wish we could keep his mind off such things but I dont have much time to be with him now
I wonder if hed like to have me bring my magic lantern over some evening
Alexandra turned her face toward him
Oh Carl
Have you got it
Yes
Its back there in the straw
Didnt you notice the box I was carrying
I tried it all morning in the drugstore cellar and it worked ever so well makes fine big pictures
What are they about
Oh hunting pictures in Germany and Robinson Crusoe and funny pictures about cannibals
Im going to paint some slides for it on glass out of the Hans Andersen book
Alexandra seemed actually cheered
There is often a good deal of the child left in people who have had to grow up too soon
Do bring it over Carl
I can hardly wait to see it and Im sure it will please father
Are the pictures col ored
Then I know hell like them
He likes the calendars I get him in town
I wish I could get more
You must leave me here mustnt you
Its been nice to have company
Carl stopped the horses and looked dubi ously up at the black sky
Its pretty dark
Of course the horses will take you home but I think Id better light your lantern in case you should need it
He gave her the reins and climbed back into the wagonbox where he crouched down and made a tent of his overcoat
After a dozen trials he succeeded in lighting the lantern which he placed in front of Alexandra half covering it with a blanket so that the light would not shine in her eyes
Now wait until I find my box
Yes here it is
Goodnight Alexandra
Try not to worry
Carl sprang to the ground and ran off across the fields toward the Linstrum homestead
Hoo hooooo
he called back as he disappeared over a ridge and dropped into a sand gully
The wind answered him like an echo Hoo hooooooo
Alexandra drove off alone
The rattle of her wagon was lost in the howling of the wind but her lantern held firmly between her feet made a moving point of light along the highway going deeper and deeper into the dark country
II On one of the ridges of that wintry waste stood the low log house in which John Bergson was dying
The Bergson homestead was easier to find than many another because it over looked Norway Creek a shallow muddy stream that sometimes flowed and sometimes stood still at the bottom of a winding ravine with steep shelving sides overgrown with brush and cottonwoods and dwarf ash
This creek gave a sort of identity to the farms that bordered upon it
Of all the bewildering things about a new country the absence of human landmarks is one of the most depressing and disheartening
The houses on the Divide were small and were usually tucked away in low places you did not see them until you came directly upon them
Most of them were built of the sod itself and were only the unescapable ground in another form
The roads were but faint tracks in the grass and the fields were scarcely noticeable
The record of the plow was insignificant like the feeble scratches on stone left by prehistoric races so indeterminate that they may after all be only the markings of glaciers and not a rec ord of human strivings
In eleven long years John Bergson had made but little impression upon the wild land he had come to tame
It was still a wild thing that had its ugly moods and no one knew when they were likely to come or why
Mischance hung over it
Its Genius was unfriendly to man
The sick man was feeling this as he lay looking out of the window after the doctor had left him on the day following Alexandras trip to town
There it lay outside his door the same land the same leadcolored miles
He knew every ridge and draw and gully between him and the horizon
To the south his plowed fields to the east the sod stables the cattle corral the pond and then the grass
Bergson went over in his mind the things that had held him back
One winter his cattle had perished in a blizzard
The next summer one of his plow horses broke its leg in a prairie dog hole and had to be shot
Another summer he lost his hogs from cholera and a valuable stallion died from a rattlesnake bite
Time and again his crops had failed
He had lost two children boys that came between Lou and Emil and there had been the cost of sickness and death
Now when he had at last struggled out of debt he was going to die himself
He was only fortysix and had of course counted upon more time
Bergson had spent his first five years on the Divide getting into debt and the last six getting out
He had paid off his mortgages and had ended pretty much where he began with the land
He owned exactly six hundred and forty acres of what stretched outside his door his own original homestead and timber claim making three hundred and twenty acres and the half section adjoining the homestead of a younger brother who had given up the fight gone back to Chicago to work in a fancy bakery and dis tinguish himself in a Swedish athletic club
So far John had not attempted to cultivate the second halfsection but used it for pasture land and one of his sons rode herd there in open weather
John Bergson had the OldWorld belief that land in itself is desirable
But this land was an enigma
It was like a horse that no one knows how to break to harness that runs wild and kicks things to pieces
He had an idea that no one understood how to farm it properly and this he often discussed with Alexandra
Their neighbors certainly knew even less about farming than he did
Many of them had never worked on a farm until they took up their homesteads
They had been HANDWERKERS at home tailors locksmiths joiners cigar makers etc
Bergson himself had worked in a shipyard
For weeks John Bergson had been thinking about these things
His bed stood in the sitting room next to the kitchen
Through the day while the baking and washing and ironing were going on the father lay and looked up at the roof beams that he himself had hewn or out at the cattle in the corral
He counted the cattle over and over
It diverted him to speculate as to how much weight each of the steers would probably put on by spring
He often called his daughter in to talk to her about this
Before Alexandra was twelve years old she had begun to be a help to him and as she grew older he had come to depend more and more upon her resourcefulness and good judgment
His boys were willing enough to work but when he talked with them they usually irritated him
It was Alexandra who read the papers and fol lowed the markets and who learned by the mis takes of their neighbors
It was Alexandra who could always tell about what it had cost to fat ten each steer and who could guess the weight of a hog before it went on the scales closer than John Bergson himself
Lou and Oscar were in dustrious but he could never teach them to use their heads about their work
Alexandra her father often said to himself was like her grandfather which was his way of saying that she was intelligent
John Bergsons father had been a shipbuilder a man of consid erable force and of some fortune
Late in life he married a second time a Stockholm woman of questionable character much younger than he who goaded him into every sort of extrava gance
On the shipbuilders part this marriage was an infatuation the despairing folly of a powerful man who cannot bear to grow old
In a few years his unprincipled wife warped the probity of a lifetime
He speculated lost his own fortune and funds entrusted to him by poor seafaring men and died disgraced leav ing his children nothing
But when all was said he had come up from the sea himself had built up a proud little business with no capital but his own skill and foresight and had proved himself a man
In his daughter John Bergson recog nized the strength of will and the simple direct way of thinking things out that had charac terized his father in his better days
He would much rather of course have seen this likeness in one of his sons but it was not a question of choice
As he lay there day after day he had to accept the situation as it was and to be thank ful that there was one among his children to whom he could entrust the future of his family and the possibilities of his hardwon land
The winter twilight was fading
The sick man heard his wife strike a match in the kitchen and the light of a lamp glimmered through the cracks of the door
It seemed like a light shin ing far away
He turned painfully in his bed and looked at his white hands with all the work gone out of them
He was ready to give up he felt
He did not know how it had come about but he was quite willing to go deep un der his fields and rest where the plow could not find him
He was tired of making mistakes
He was content to leave the tangle to other hands he thought of his Alexandras strong ones
DOTTER he called feebly DOTTER
He heard her quick step and saw her tall figure appear in the doorway with the light of the lamp behind her
He felt her youth and strength how easily she moved and stooped and lifted
But he would not have had it again if he could not he
He knew the end too well to wish to begin again
He knew where it all went to what it all became
His daughter came and lifted him up on his pillows
She called him by an old Swedish name that she used to call him when she was little and took his dinner to him in the shipyard
Tell the boys to come here daughter
I want to speak to them
They are feeding the horses father
They have just come back from the Blue
Shall I call them
He sighed
No no
Wait until they come in
Alexandra you will have to do the best you can for your brothers
Everything will come on you
I will do all I can father
Dont let them get discouraged and go off like Uncle Otto
I want them to keep the land
We will father
We will never lose the land
There was a sound of heavy feet in the kitchen
Alexandra went to the door and beck oned to her brothers two strapping boys of seventeen and nineteen
They came in and stood at the foot of the bed
Their father looked at them searchingly though it was too dark to see their faces they were just the same boys he told himself he had not been mistaken in them
The square head and heavy shoulders belonged to Oscar the elder
The younger boy was quicker but vacillating
Boys said the father wearily I want you to keep the land together and to be guided by your sister
I have talked to her since I have been sick and she knows all my wishes
I want no quarrels among my children and so long as there is one house there must be one head
Alexandra is the oldest and she knows my wishes
She will do the best she can
If she makes mistakes she will not make so many as I have made
When you marry and want a house of your own the land will be divided fairly according to the courts
But for the next few years you will have it hard and you must all keep together
Alexandra will manage the best she can
Oscar who was usually the last to speak replied because he was the older Yes father
It would be so anyway without your speaking
We will all work the place together
And you will be guided by your sister boys and be good brothers to her and good sons to your mother
That is good
And Alexandra must not work in the fields any more
There is no necessity now
Hire a man when you need help
She can make much more with her eggs and butter than the wages of a man
It was one of my mistakes that I did not find that out sooner
Try to break a little more land every year sod corn is good for fodder
Keep turning the land and always put up more hay than you need
Dont grudge your mother a little time for plowing her garden and setting out fruit trees even if it comes in a busy season
She has been a good mother to you and she has always When they went back to the kitchen the boys sat down silently at the table
Throughout the meal they looked down at their plates and did not lift their red eyes
They did not eat much although they had been working in the cold all day and there was a rabbit stewed in gravy for supper and prune pies
John Bergson had married beneath him but he had married a good housewife
Mrs Berg son was a fairskinned corpulent woman heavy and placid like her son Oscar but there was something comfortable about her perhaps it was her own love of comfort
For eleven years she had worthily striven to maintain some sem blance of household order amid conditions that made order very difficult
Habit was very strong with Mrs Bergson and her unremitting efforts to repeat the routine of her old life among new surroundings had done a great deal to keep the family from disintegrating morally and get ting careless in their ways
The Bergsons had a log house for instance only because Mrs Bergson would not live in a sod house
She missed the fish diet of her own country and twice every summer she sent the boys to the river twenty miles to the southward to fish for channel cat
When the children were little she used to load them all into the wagon the baby in its crib and go fishing herself
Alexandra often said that if her mother were cast upon a desert island she would thank God for her deliverance make a garden and find something to preserve
Preserving was almost a mania with Mrs Bergson
Stout as she was she roamed the scrubby banks of Norway Creek looking for fox grapes and goose plums like a wild creature in search of prey
She made a yel low jam of the insipid groundcherries that grew on the prairie flavoring it with lemon peel and she made a sticky dark conserve of garden toma toes
She had experimented even with the rank buffalopea and she could not see a fine bronze cluster of them without shaking her head and murmuring What a pity
When there was nothing more to preserve she began to pickle
The amount of sugar she used in these processes was sometimes a serious drain upon the family resources
She was a good mother but she was glad when her children were old enough not to be in her way in the kitchen
She had never quite forgiven John Bergson for bringing her to the end of the earth but now that she was there she wanted to be let alone to reconstruct her old life in so far as that was possible
She could still take some comfort in the world if she had bacon in the cave glass jars on the shelves and sheets in the press
She disap proved of all her neighbors because of their slovenly housekeeping and the women thought her very proud
Once when Mrs Bergson on her way to Norway Creek stopped to see old Mrs Lee the old woman hid in the haymow for fear Mis Bergson would catch her bare foot
III One Sunday afternoon in July six months after John Bergsons death Carl was sitting in the doorway of the Linstrum kitchen dreaming over an illustrated paper when he heard the rattle of a wagon along the hill road
Looking up he recognized the Bergsons team with two seats in the wagon which meant they were off for a pleasure excursion
Oscar and Lou on the front seat wore their cloth hats and coats never worn except on Sundays and Emil on the second seat with Alexandra sat proudly in his new trousers made from a pair of his fathers and a pinkstriped shirt with a wide ruffled collar
Oscar stopped the horses and waved to Carl who caught up his hat and ran through the melon patch to join them
Want to go with us
Lou called
Were going to Crazy Ivars to buy a hammock
Sure
Carl ran up panting and clamber ing over the wheel sat down beside Emil
Ive always wanted to see Ivars pond
They say its the biggest in all the country
Arent you afraid to go to Ivars in that new shirt Emil
He might want it and take it right off your back
Emil grinned
Id be awful scared to go he admitted if you big boys werent along to take care of me
Did you ever hear him howl Carl
People say sometimes he runs about the country howling at night because he is afraid the Lord will destroy him
Mother thinks he must have done something awful wicked
Lou looked back and winked at Carl
What would you do Emil if you was out on the prairie by yourself and seen him coming
Emil stared
Maybe I could hide in a badgerhole he suggested doubtfully
But suppose there wasnt any badgerhole Lou persisted
Would you run
No Id be too scared to run Emil ad mitted mournfully twisting his fingers
I guess Id sit right down on the ground and say my prayers
The big boys laughed and Oscar brandished his whip over the broad backs of the horses
He wouldnt hurt you Emil said Carl persuasively
He came to doctor our mare when she ate green corn and swelled up most as big as the watertank
He petted her just like you do your cats
I couldnt understand much he said for he dont talk any English but he kept patting her and groaning as if he had the pain himself and saying There now sister thats easier thats better
Lou and Oscar laughed and Emil giggled delightedly and looked up at his sister
I dont think he knows anything at all about doctoring said Oscar scornfully
They say when horses have distemper he takes the medicine himself and then prays over the horses
Alexandra spoke up
Thats what the Crows said but he cured their horses all the same
Some days his mind is cloudy like
But if you can get him on a clear day you can learn a great deal from him
He understands ani mals
Didnt I see him take the horn off the Berquists cow when she had torn it loose and went crazy
She was tearing all over the place knocking herself against things
And at last she ran out on the roof of the old dugout and her legs went through and there she stuck bel lowing
Ivar came running with his white bag and the moment he got to her she was quiet and let him saw her horn off and daub the place with tar
Emil had been watching his sister his face reflecting the sufferings of the cow
And then didnt it hurt her any more
he asked
Alexandra patted him
No not any more
And in two days they could use her milk again
The road to Ivars homestead was a very poor one
He had settled in the rough country across the county line where no one lived but some Russianshalf a dozen families who dwelt together in one long house divided off like barracks
Ivar had explained his choice by saying that the fewer neighbors he had the fewer temptations
Nevertheless when one considered that his chief business was horse doctoring it seemed rather shortsighted of him to live in the most inaccessible place he could find
The Bergson wagon lurched along over the rough hummocks and grass banks fol lowed the bottom of winding draws or skirted the margin of wide lagoons where the golden coreopsis grew up out of the clear water and the wild ducks rose with a whirr of wings
Lou looked after them helplessly
I wish Id brought my gun anyway Alexandra he said fretfully
I could have hidden it under the straw in the bottom of the wagon
Then wed have had to lie to Ivar
Besides they say he can smell dead birds
And if he knew we wouldnt get anything out of him not even a hammock
I want to talk to him and he wont talk sense if hes angry
It makes him foolish
Lou sniffed
Whoever heard of him talking sense anyhow
Id rather have ducks for sup per than Crazy Ivars tongue
Emil was alarmed
Oh but Lou you dont want to make him mad
He might howl
They all laughed again and Oscar urged the horses up the crumbling side of a clay bank
They had left the lagoons and the red grass behind them
In Crazy Ivars country the grass was short and gray the draws deeper than they were in the Bergsons neighborhood and the land was all broken up into hillocks and clay ridges
The wild flowers disappeared and only in the bottom of the draws and gullies grew a few of the very toughest and hardiest shoestring and ironweed and snowonthe mountain
Look look Emil theres Ivars big pond
Alexandra pointed to a shining sheet of water that lay at the bottom of a shallow draw
At one end of the pond was an earthen dam planted with green willow bushes and above it a door and a single window were set into the hillside
You would not have seen them at all but for the reflection of the sunlight upon the four panes of windowglass
And that was all you saw
Not a shed not a corral not a well not even a path broken in the curly grass
But for the piece of rusty stovepipe sticking up through the sod you could have walked over the roof of Ivars dwelling without dreaming that you were near a human habitation
Ivar had lived for three years in the clay bank with out defiling the face of nature any more than the coyote that had lived there before him had done
When the Bergsons drove over the hill Ivar was sitting in the doorway of his house reading the Norwegian Bible
He was a queerly shaped old man with a thick powerful body set on short bowlegs
His shaggy white hair falling in a thick mane about his ruddy cheeks made him look older than he was
He was barefoot but he wore a clean shirt of unbleached cotton open at the neck
He always put on a clean shirt when Sunday morning came round though he never went to church
He had a peculiar religion of his own and could not get on with any of the denominations
Often he did not see anybody from one weeks end to another
He kept a calendar and every morning he checked off a day so that he was never in any doubt as to which day of the week it was
Ivar hired him self out in threshing and cornhusking time and he doctored sick animals when he was sent for
When he was at home he made ham mocks out of twine and committed chapters of the Bible to memory
Ivar found contentment in the solitude he had sought out for himself
He disliked the litter of human dwellings the broken food the bits of broken china the old washboilers and teakettles thrown into the sunflower patch
He preferred the cleanness and tidiness of the wild sod
He always said that the badgers had cleaner houses than people and that when he took a housekeeper her name would be Mrs Badger
He best expressed his preference for his wild homestead by saying that his Bible seemed truer to him there
If one stood in the doorway of his cave and looked off at the rough land the smiling sky the curly grass white in the hot sunlight if one listened to the rapturous song of the lark the drumming of the quail the burr of the locust against that vast silence one understood what Ivar meant
On this Sunday afternoon his face shone with happiness
He closed the book on his knee keeping the place with his horny finger and He sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills They give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst
The trees of the Lord are full of sap the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted Where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house
The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies
repeated softly Before he opened his Bible again Ivar heard the Bergsons wagon approaching and he sprang up and ran toward it
No guns no guns
he shouted waving his arms distractedly
No Ivar no guns Alexandra called reas suringly
He dropped his arms and went up to the wagon smiling amiably and looking at them out of his pale blue eyes
We want to buy a hammock if you have one Alexandra explained and my little brother here wants to see your big pond where so many birds come
Ivar smiled foolishly and began rubbing the horses noses and feeling about their mouths behind the bits
Not many birds just now
A few ducks this morning and some snipe come to drink
But there was a crane last week
She spent one night and came back the next evening
I dont know why
It is not her sea son of course
Many of them go over in the fall
Then the pond is full of strange voices every night
Alexandra translated for Carl who looked thoughtful
Ask him Alexandra if it is true that a sea gull came here once
I have heard so
She had some difficulty in making the old man understand
He looked puzzled at first then smote his hands together as he remembered
Oh yes yes
A big white bird with long wings and pink feet
My
what a voice she had
She came in the afternoon and kept flying about the pond and screaming until dark
She was in trouble of some sort but I could not understand her
She was going over to the other ocean maybe and did not know how far it was
She was afraid of never getting there
She was more mournful than our birds here she cried in the night
She saw the light from my window and darted up to it
Maybe she thought my house was a boat she was such a wild thing
Next morning when the sun rose I went out to take her food but she flew up into the sky and went on her way
Ivar ran his fingers through his thick hair
I have many strange birds stop with me here
They come from very far away and are great company
I hope you boys never shoot wild birds
Lou and Oscar grinned and Ivar shook his bushy head
Yes I know boys are thoughtless
But these wild things are Gods birds
He watches over them and counts them as we do our cattle Christ says so in the New Testa ment
Now Ivar Lou asked may we water our horses at your pond and give them some feed
Its a bad road to your place
Yes yes it is
The old man scrambled about and began to loose the tugs
A bad road eh girls
And the bay with a colt at home
Oscar brushed the old man aside
Well take care of the horses Ivar
Youll be finding some disease on them
Alexandra wants to see your hammocks
Ivar led Alexandra and Emil to his little cave house
He had but one room neatly plas tered and whitewashed and there was a wooden floor
There was a kitchen stove a table cov ered with oilcloth two chairs a clock a calen dar a few books on the windowshelf nothing more
But the place was as clean as a cup board
But where do you sleep Ivar
Emil asked looking about
Ivar unslung a hammock from a hook on the wall in it was rolled a buffalo robe
There my son
A hammock is a good bed and in winter I wrap up in this skin
Where I go to work the beds are not half so easy as this
By this time Emil had lost all his timidity
He thought a cave a very superior kind of house
There was something pleasantly unusual about it and about Ivar
Do the birds know you will be kind to them Ivar
Is that why so many come
he asked
Ivar sat down on the floor and tucked his feet under him
See little brother they have come from a long way and they are very tired
From up there where they are flying our coun try looks dark and flat
They must have water to drink and to bathe in before they can go on with their journey
They look this way and that and far below them they see something shining like a piece of glass set in the dark earth
That is my pond
They come to it and are not disturbed
Maybe I sprinkle a little corn
They tell the other birds and next year more come this way
They have their roads up there as we have down here
Emil rubbed his knees thoughtfully
And is that true Ivar about the head ducks falling back when they are tired and the hind ones taking their place
Yes
The point of the wedge gets the worst of it they cut the wind
They can only stand it there a little whilehalf an hour maybe
Then they fall back and the wedge splits a little while the rear ones come up the middle to the front
Then it closes up and they fly on with a new edge
They are always changing like that up in the air
Never any confusion just like soldiers who have been drilled
Alexandra had selected her hammock by the time the boys came up from the pond
They would not come in but sat in the shade of the bank outside while Alexandra and Ivar talked about the birds and about his housekeeping and why he never ate meat fresh or salt
Alexandra was sitting on one of the wooden chairs her arms resting on the table
Ivar was sitting on the floor at her feet
Ivar she said suddenly beginning to trace the pattern on the oilcloth with her forefinger I came today more because I wanted to talk to you than be cause I wanted to buy a hammock
Yes
The old man scraped his bare feet on the plank floor
We have a big bunch of hogs Ivar
I wouldnt sell in the spring when everybody advised me to and now so many people are losing their hogs that I am frightened
What can be done
Ivars little eyes began to shine
They lost their vagueness
You feed them swill and such stuff
Of course
And sour milk
Oh yes
And keep them in a stinking pen
I tell you sister the hogs of this country are put upon
They be come unclean like the hogs in the Bible
If you kept your chickens like that what would hap pen
You have a little sorghum patch maybe
Put a fence around it and turn the hogs in
Build a shed to give them shade a thatch on poles
Let the boys haul water to them in bar rels clean water and plenty
Get them off the old stinking ground and do not let them go back there until winter
Give them only grain and clean feed such as you would give horses or cattle
Hogs do not like to be filthy
The boys outside the door had been listening
Lou nudged his brother
Come the horses are done eating
Lets hitch up and get out of here
Hell fill her full of notions
Shell be for having the pigs sleep with us next
Oscar grunted and got up
Carl who could not understand what Ivar said saw that the two boys were displeased
They did not mind hard work but they hated experiments and could never see the use of taking pains
Even Lou who was more elastic than his older bro ther disliked to do anything different from their neighbors
He felt that it made them conspicuous and gave people a chance to talk about them
Once they were on the homeward road the boys forgot their illhumor and joked about Ivar and his birds
Alexandra did not propose any reforms in the care of the pigs and they hoped she had forgotten Ivars talk
They agreed that he was crazier than ever and would never be able to prove up on his land because he worked it so little
Alexandra privately resolved that she would have a talk with Ivar about this and stir him up
The boys persuaded Carl to stay for supper and go swimming in the pasture pond after dark
That evening after she had washed the sup per dishes Alexandra sat down on the kitchen doorstep while her mother was mixing the bread
It was a still deepbreathing summer night full of the smell of the hay fields
Sounds of laughter and splashing came up from the pasture and when the moon rose rapidly above the bare rim of the prairie the pond glittered like polished metal and she could see the flash of white bodies as the boys ran about the edge or jumped into the water
Alexandra watched the shimmering pool dreamily but eventually her eyes went back to the sorghum patch south of the barn where she was planning to make her new pig corral
IV For the first three years after John Bergsons death the affairs of his family prospered
Then came the hard times that brought every one on the Divide to the brink of despair three years of drouth and failure the last struggle of a wild soil against the encroaching plowshare
The first of these fruitless summers the Bergson boys bore courageously
The failure of the corn crop made labor cheap
Lou and Oscar hired two men and put in bigger crops than ever before
They lost everything they spent
The whole country was discouraged
Farmers who were already in debt had to give up their land
A few foreclosures demoralized the county
The settlers sat about on the wooden sidewalks in the little town and told each other that the country was never meant for men to live in the thing to do was to get back to Iowa to Illinois to any place that had been proved habitable
The Bergson boys certainly would have been happier with their uncle Otto in the bakery shop in Chicago
Like most of their neighbors they were meant to follow in paths already marked out for them not to break trails in a new country
A steady job a few holidays nothing to think about and they would have been very happy
It was no fault of theirs that they had been dragged into the wilderness when they were little boys
A pioneer should have imagination should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves
The second of these barren summers was passing
One September afternoon Alexandra had gone over to the garden across the draw to dig sweet potatoesthey had been thriving upon the weather that was fatal to everything else
But when Carl Linstrum came up the garden rows to find her she was not working
She was standing lost in thought leaning upon her pitchfork her sunbonnet lying beside her on the ground
The dry garden patch smelled of drying vines and was strewn with yellow seedcucumbers and pumpkins and citrons
At one end next the rhubarb grew feathery asparagus with red berries
Down the middle of the garden was a row of gooseberry and cur rant bushes
A few tough zenias and marigolds and a row of scarlet sage bore witness to the buckets of water that Mrs Bergson had carried there after sundown against the prohibition of her sons
Carl came quietly and slowly up the garden path looking intently at Alexandra
She did not hear him
She was standing per fectly still with that serious ease so character istic of her
Her thick reddish braids twisted about her head fairly burned in the sunlight
The air was cool enough to make the warm sun pleasant on ones back and shoulders and so clear that the eye could follow a hawk up and up into the blazing blue depths of the sky
Even Carl never a very cheerful boy and con siderably darkened by these last two bitter years loved the country on days like this felt something strong and young and wild come out of it that laughed at care
Alexandra he said as he approached her I want to talk to you
Lets sit down by the gooseberry bushes
He picked up her sack of potatoes and they crossed the garden
Boys gone to town
he asked as he sank down on the warm sunbaked earth
Well we have made up our minds at last Alexandra
We are really going away
She looked at him as if she were a little fright ened
Really Carl
Is it settled
Yes father has heard from St Louis and they will give him back his old job in the cigar factory
He must be there by the first of November
They are taking on new men then
We will sell the place for whatever we can get and auction the stock
We havent enough to ship
I am going to learn engraving with a German engraver there and then try to get work in Chicago
Alexandras hands dropped in her lap
Her eyes became dreamy and filled with tears
Carls sensitive lower lip trembled
He scratched in the soft earth beside him with a stick
Thats all I hate about it Alexandra he said slowly
Youve stood by us through so much and helped father out so many times and now it seems as if we were running off and leaving you to face the worst of it
But it isnt as if we could really ever be of any help to you
We are only one more drag one more thing you look out for and feel responsible for
Father was never meant for a farmer you know that
And I hate it
Wed only get in deeper and deeper
Yes yes Carl I know
You are wasting your life here
You are able to do much better things
You are nearly nineteen now and I wouldnt have you stay
Ive always hoped you would get away
But I cant help feeling scared when I think how I will miss you more than you will ever know
She brushed the tears from her cheeks not trying to hide them
But Alexandra he said sadly and wist fully Ive never been any real help to you beyond sometimes trying to keep the boys in a good humor
Alexandra smiled and shook her head
Oh its not that
Nothing like that
Its by under standing me and the boys and mother that youve helped me
I expect that is the only way one person ever really can help another
I think you are about the only one that ever helped me
Somehow it will take more courage to bear your going than everything that has happened before
Carl looked at the ground
You see weve all depended so on you he said even father
He makes me laugh
When anything comes up he always says I wonder what the Bergsons are going to do about that
I guess Ill go and ask her
Ill never forget that time when we first came here and our horse had the colic and I ran over to your placeyour father was away and you came home with me and showed father how to let the wind out of the horse
You were only a little girl then but you knew ever so much more about farm work than poor father
You remember how homesick I used to get and what long talks we used to have coming from school
Weve someway always felt alike about things
Yes thats it weve liked the same things and weve liked them together without any body else knowing
And weve had good times hunting for Christmas trees and going for ducks and making our plum wine together every year
Weve never either of us had any other close friend
And now Alexandra wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron and now I must remember that you are going where you will have many friends and will find the work you were meant to do
But youll write to me Carl
That will mean a great deal to me here
Ill write as long as I live cried the boy impetuously
And Ill be working for you as much as for myself Alexandra
I want to do something youll like and be proud of
Im a fool here but I know I can do something
He sat up and frowned at the red grass
Alexandra sighed
How discouraged the boys will be when they hear
They always come home from town discouraged anyway
So many people are trying to leave the country and they talk to our boys and make them low spirited
Im afraid they are beginning to feel hard toward me because I wont listen to any talk about going
Sometimes I feel like Im getting tired of standing up for this country
I wont tell the boys yet if youd rather not
Oh Ill tell them myself tonight when they come home
Theyll be talking wild any way and no good comes of keeping bad news
Its all harder on them than it is on me
Lou wants to get married poor boy and he cant until times are better
See there goes the sun Carl
I must be getting back
Mother will want her potatoes
Its chilly already the moment the light goes
Alexandra rose and looked about
A golden afterglow throbbed in the west but the coun try already looked empty and mournful
A dark moving mass came over the western hill the Lee boy was bringing in the herd from the other halfsection
Emil ran from the windmill to open the corral gate
From the log house on the little rise across the draw the smoke was curling
The cattle lowed and bellowed
In the sky the pale halfmoon was slowly silvering
Alexandra and Carl walked together down the potato rows
I have to keep telling myself what is going to happen she said softly
Since you have been here ten years now I have never really been lonely
But I can remember what it was like before
Now I shall have nobody but Emil
But he is my boy and he is tenderhearted
That night when the boys were called to supper they sat down moodily
They had worn their coats to town but they ate in their striped shirts and suspenders
They were grown men now and as Alexandra said for the last few years they had been growing more and more like themselves
Lou was still the slighter of the two the quicker and more intelligent but apt to go off at halfcock
He had a lively blue eye a thin fair skin always burned red to the neckband of his shirt in summer stiff yellow hair that would not lie down on his head and a bristly little yellow mustache of which he was very proud
Oscar could not grow a mus tache his pale face was as bare as an egg and his white eyebrows gave it an empty look
He was a man of powerful body and unusual endur ance the sort of man you could attach to a cornsheller as you would an engine
He would turn it all day without hurrying without slow ing down
But he was as indolent of mind as he was unsparing of his body
His love of routine amounted to a vice
He worked like an insect always doing the same thing over in the same way regardless of whether it was best or no
He felt that there was a sovereign virtue in mere bodily toil and he rather liked to do things in the hardest way
If a field had once been in corn he couldnt bear to put it into wheat
He liked to begin his cornplanting at the same time every year whether the season were backward or forward
He seemed to feel that by his own irreproachable regularity he would clear himself of blame and reprove the weather
When the wheat crop failed he threshed the straw at a dead loss to demon strate how little grain there was and thus prove his case against Providence
Lou on the other hand was fussy and flighty always planned to get through two days work in one and often got only the least important things done
He liked to keep the place up but he never got round to doing odd jobs until he had to neglect more pressing work to attend to them
In the middle of the wheat harvest when the grain was overripe and every hand was needed he would stop to mend fences or to patch the harness then dash down to the field and overwork and be laid up in bed for a week
The two boys balanced each other and they pulled well together
They had been good friends since they were children
One seldom went anywhere even to town without the other
Tonight after they sat down to supper Oscar kept looking at Lou as if he expected him to say something and Lou blinked his eyes and frowned at his plate
It was Alexandra herself who at last opened the discussion
The Linstrums she said calmly as she put another plate of hot biscuit on the table are going back to St Louis
The old man is going to work in the cigar factory again
At this Lou plunged in
You see Alex andra everybody who can crawl out is going away
Theres no use of us trying to stick it out just to be stubborn
Theres something in knowing when to quit
Where do you want to go Lou
Any place where things will grow
said Oscar grimly
Lou reached for a potato
Chris Arnson has traded his halfsection for a place down on the river
Who did he trade with
Charley Fuller in town
Fuller the real estate man
You see Lou that Fuller has a head on him
Hes buy ing and trading for every bit of land he can get up here
Itll make him a rich man some day
Hes rich now thats why he can take a chance
Why cant we
Well live longer than he will
Some day the land itself will be worth more than all we can ever raise on it
Lou laughed
It could be worth that and still not be worth much
Why Alexandra you dont know what youre talking about
Our place wouldnt bring now what it would six years ago
The fellows that settled up here just made a mistake
Now theyre beginning to see this high land wasnt never meant to grow no thing on and everybody who aint fixed to graze cattle is trying to crawl out
Its too high to farm up here
All the Americans are skinning out
That man Percy Adams north of town told me that he was going to let Fuller take his land and stuff for four hundred dollars and a ticket to Chicago
Theres Fuller again
Alexandra ex claimed
I wish that man would take me for a partner
Hes feathering his nest
If only poor people could learn a little from rich people
But all these fellows who are running off are bad farmers like poor Mr Linstrum
They couldnt get ahead even in good years and they all got into debt while father was getting out
I think we ought to hold on as long as we can on fathers account
He was so set on keeping this land
He must have seen harder times than this here
How was it in the early days mother
Mrs Bergson was weeping quietly
These family discussions always depressed her and made her remember all that she had been torn away from
I dont see why the boys are always taking on about going away she said wiping her eyes
I dont want to move again out to some raw place maybe where wed be worse off than we are here and all to do over again
I wont move
If the rest of you go I will ask some of the neighbors to take me in and stay and be buried by father
Im not going to leave him by himself on the prairie for cattle to run over
She began to cry more bitterly
The boys looked angry
Alexandra put a soothing hand on her mothers shoulder
Theres no question of that mother
You dont have to go if you dont want to
A third of the place belongs to you by American law and we cant sell without your consent
We only want you to advise us
How did it use to be when you and father first came
Was it really as bad as this or not
Oh worse
Much worse moaned Mrs Bergson
Drouth chincebugs hail every thing
My garden all cut to pieces like sauer kraut
No grapes on the creek no nothing
The people all lived just like coyotes
Oscar got up and tramped out of the kitchen
Lou followed him
They felt that Alexandra had taken an unfair advantage in turning their mother loose on them
The next morning they were silent and reserved
They did not offer to take the women to church but went down to the barn immediately after breakfast and stayed there all day
When Carl Linstrum came over in the afternoon Alexandra winked to him and pointed toward the barn
He under stood her and went down to play cards with the boys
They believed that a very wicked thing to do on Sunday and it relieved their feelings
Alexandra stayed in the house
On Sunday afternoon Mrs Bergson always took a nap and Alexandra read
During the week she read only the newspaper but on Sunday and in the long evenings of winter she read a good deal read a few things over a great many times
She knew long portions of the Frithjof Saga by heart and like most Swedes who read at all she was fond of Longfellows versethe ballads and the Golden Legend and The Spanish Stu dent
Today she sat in the wooden rocking chair with the Swedish Bible open on her knees but she was not reading
She was looking thoughtfully away at the point where the up land road disappeared over the rim of the prairie
Her body was in an attitude of perfect repose such as it was apt to take when she was thinking earnestly
Her mind was slow truth ful steadfast
She had not the least spark of cleverness
All afternoon the sittingroom was full of quiet and sunlight
Emil was making rabbit traps in the kitchen shed
The hens were cluck ing and scratching brown holes in the flower beds and the wind was teasing the princes feather by the door
That evening Carl came in with the boys to supper
Emil said Alexandra when they were all seated at the table how would you like to go traveling
Because I am going to take a trip and you can go with me if you want to
The boys looked up in amazement they were always afraid of Alexandras schemes
Carl was interested
Ive been thinking boys she went on that maybe I am too set against making a change
Im going to take Brigham and the buckboard tomorrow and drive down to the river country and spend a few days looking over what theyve got down there
If I find anything good you boys can go down and make a trade
Nobody down there will trade for anything up here said Oscar gloomily
Thats just what I want to find out
Maybe they are just as discontented down there as we are up here
Things away from home often look better than they are
You know what your Hans Andersen book says Carl about the Swedes liking to buy Danish bread and the Danes liking to buy Swedish bread because people always think the bread of another country is better than their own
Anyway Ive heard so much about the river farms I wont be satisfied till Ive seen for myself
Lou fidgeted
Look out
Dont agree to anything
Dont let them fool you
Lou was apt to be fooled himself
He had not yet learned to keep away from the shellgame wagons that followed the circus
After supper Lou put on a necktie and went across the fields to court Annie Lee and Carl and Oscar sat down to a game of checkers while Alexandra read The Swiss Family Robinson aloud to her mother and Emil
It was not long before the two boys at the table neglected their game to listen
They were all big children together and they found the adventures of the family in the tree house so absorbing that they gave them their undivided attention
V Alexandra and Emil spent five days down among the river farms driving up and down the valley
Alexandra talked to the men about their crops and to the women about their poul try
She spent a whole day with one young farmer who had been away at school and who was experimenting with a new kind of clover hay
She learned a great deal
As they drove along she and Emil talked and planned
At last on the sixth day Alexandra turned Brig hams head northward and left the river behind
Theres nothing in it for us down there Emil
There are a few fine farms but they are owned by the rich men in town and couldnt be bought
Most of the land is rough and hilly
They can always scrape along down there but they can never do anything big
Down there they have a little certainty but up with us there is a big chance
We must have faith in the high land Emil
I want to hold on harder than ever and when youre a man youll thank me
She urged Brigham forward
When the road began to climb the first long swells of the Divide Alexandra hummed an old Swedish hymn and Emil wondered why his sister looked so happy
Her face was so radiant that he felt shy about asking her
For the first time perhaps since that land emerged from the waters of geologic ages a human face was set toward it with love and yearning
It seemed beautiful to her rich and strong and glorious
Her eyes drank in the breadth of it until her tears blinded her
Then the Genius of the Divide the great free spirit which breathes across it must have bent lower than it ever bent to a human will before
The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman
Alexandra reached home in the afternoon
That evening she held a family council and told her brothers all that she had seen and heard
I want you boys to go down yourselves and look it over
Nothing will convince you like seeing with your own eyes
The river land was settled before this and so they are a few years ahead of us and have learned more about farm ing
The land sells for three times as much as this but in five years we will double it
The rich men down there own all the best land and they are buying all they can get
The thing to do is to sell our cattle and what little old corn we have and buy the Linstrum place
Then the next thing to do is to take out two loans on our halfsections and buy Peter Crows place raise every dollar we can and buy every acre we can
Mortgage the homestead again
Lou cried
He sprang up and began to wind the clock furiously
I wont slave to pay off another mortgage
Ill never do it
Youd just as soon kill us all Alexandra to carry out some scheme
Oscar rubbed his high pale forehead
How do you propose to pay off your mortgages
Alexandra looked from one to the other and bit her lip
They had never seen her so ner vous
See here she brought out at last
We borrow the money for six years
Well with the money we buy a halfsection from Linstrum and a half from Crow and a quarter from Struble maybe
That will give us up wards of fourteen hundred acres wont it
You wont have to pay off your mortgages for six years
By that time any of this land will be worth thirty dollars an acreit will be worth fifty but well say thirty then you can sell a garden patch anywhere and pay off a debt of sixteen hundred dollars
Its not the principal Im worried about its the interest and taxes
Well have to strain to meet the payments
But as sure as we are sitting here tonight we can sit down here ten years from now independent landowners not struggling farmers any longer
The chance that father was always looking for has come
Lou was pacing the floor
But how do you KNOW that land is going to go up enough to pay the mortgages and And make us rich besides
Alexandra put in firmly
I cant explain that Lou
Youll have to take my word for it
I KNOW thats all
When you drive about over the country you can feel it coming
Oscar had been sitting with his head lowered his hands hanging between his knees
But we cant work so much land he said dully as if he were talking to himself
We cant even try
It would just lie there and wed work ourselves to death
He sighed and laid his calloused fist on the table
Alexandras eyes filled with tears
She put her hand on his shoulder
You poor boy you wont have to work it
The men in town who are buying up other peoples land dont try to farm it
They are the men to watch in a new country
Lets try to do like the shrewd ones and not like these stupid fellows
I dont want you boys always to have to work like this
I want you to be independent and Emil to go to school
Lou held his head as if it were splitting
Everybody will say we are crazy
It must be crazy or everybody would be doing it
If they were we wouldnt have much chance
No Lou I was talking about that with the smart young man who is raising the new kind of clover
He says the right thing is usu ally just what everybody dont do
Why are we better fixed than any of our neighbors
Because father had more brains
Our people were better people than these in the old coun try
We OUGHT to do more than they do and see further ahead
Yes mother Im going to clear the table now
Alexandra rose
The boys went to the stable to see to the stock and they were gone a long while
When they came back Lou played on his DRAGHARMONIKA and Oscar sat figuring at his fathers secretary all evening
They said no thing more about Alexandras project but she felt sure now that they would consent to it
Just before bedtime Oscar went out for a pail of water
When he did not come back Alexandra threw a shawl over her head and ran down the path to the windmill
She found him sitting there with his head in his hands and she sat down beside him
Dont do anything you dont want to do Oscar she whispered
She waited a moment but he did not stir
I wont say any more about it if youd rather not
What makes you so discouraged
I dread signing my name to them pieces of paper he said slowly
All the time I was a boy we had a mortgage hanging over us
Then dont sign one
I dont want you to if you feel that way
Oscar shook his head
No I can see theres a chance that way
Ive thought a good while there might be
Were in so deep now we might as well go deeper
But its hard work pulling out of debt
Like pulling a threshing machine out of the mud breaks your back
Me and Lous worked hard and I cant see its got us ahead much
Nobody knows about that as well as I do Oscar
Thats why I want to try an easier way
I dont want you to have to grub for every dollar
Yes I know what you mean
Maybe itll come out right
But signing papers is signing papers
There aint no maybe about that
He took his pail and trudged up the path to the house
Alexandra drew her shawl closer about her and stood leaning against the frame of the mill looking at the stars which glittered so keenly through the frosty autumn air
She always loved to watch them to think of their vastness and distance and of their ordered march
It fortified her to reflect upon the great operations of nature and when she thought of the law that lay behind them she felt a sense of personal security
That night she had a new conscious ness of the country felt almost a new relation to it
Even her talk with the boys had not taken away the feeling that had overwhelmed her when she drove back to the Divide that afternoon
She had never known before how much the country meant to her
The chirping of the insects down in the long grass had been like the sweetest music
She had felt as if her heart were hiding down there somewhere with the quail and the plover and all the lit tle wild things that crooned or buzzed in the sun
Under the long shaggy ridges she felt the future stirring
PART II Neighboring Fields I IT is sixteen years since John Bergson died
His wife now lies beside him and the white shaft that marks their graves gleams across the wheatfields
Could he rise from beneath it he would not know the country under which he has been asleep
The shaggy coat of the prairie which they lifted to make him a bed has van ished forever
From the Norwegian graveyard one looks out over a vast checkerboard marked off in squares of wheat and corn light and dark dark and light
Telephone wires hum along the white roads which always run at right angles
From the graveyard gate one can count a dozen gayly painted farmhouses the gilded weathervanes on the big red barns wink at each other across the green and brown and yellow fields
The light steel windmills trem ble throughout their frames and tug at their moorings as they vibrate in the wind that often blows from one weeks end to another across that high active resolute stretch of country
The Divide is now thickly populated
The rich soil yields heavy harvests the dry bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts
There are few scenes more gratifying than a spring plowing in that country where the furrows of a single field often lie a mile in length and the brown earth with such a strong clean smell and such a power of growth and fertility in it yields itself eagerly to the plow rolls away from the shear not even dimming the brightness of the metal with a soft deep sigh of happiness
The wheat cutting sometimes goes on all night as well as all day and in good seasons there are scarcely men and horses enough to do the harvesting
The grain is so heavy that it bends toward the blade and cuts like velvet
There is something frank and joyous and young in the open face of the country
It gives itself ungrudgingly to the moods of the season holding nothing back
Like the plains of Lom bardy it seems to rise a little to meet the sun
The air and the earth are curiously mated and intermingled as if the one were the breath of the other
You feel in the atmosphere the same tonic puissant quality that is in the tilth the same strength and resoluteness
One June morning a young man stood at the gate of the Norwegian graveyard sharpening his scythe in strokes unconsciously timed to the tune he was whistling
He wore a flannel cap and duck trousers and the sleeves of his white flannel shirt were rolled back to the elbow
When he was satisfied with the edge of his blade he slipped the whetstone into his hip pocket and began to swing his scythe still whistling but softly out of respect to the quiet folk about him
Unconscious respect probably for he seemed intent upon his own thoughts and like the Gladiators they were far away
He was a splendid figure of a boy tall and straight as a young pine tree with a hand some head and stormy gray eyes deeply set under a serious brow
The space between his two front teeth which were unusually far apart gave him the proficiency in whistling for which he was distinguished at college
He also played the cornet in the University band
When the grass required his close attention or when he had to stoop to cut about a head stone he paused in his lively airthe Jewel songtaking it up where he had left it when his scythe swung free again
He was not think ing about the tired pioneers over whom his blade glittered
The old wild country the struggle in which his sister was destined to suc ceed while so many men broke their hearts and died he can scarcely remember
That is all among the dim things of childhood and has been forgotten in the brighter pattern life weaves today in the bright facts of being captain of the track team and holding the interstate record for the high jump in the allsuffusing brightness of being twentyone
Yet some times in the pauses of his work the young man frowned and looked at the ground with an intentness which suggested that even twenty one might have its problems
When he had been mowing the better part of an hour he heard the rattle of a light cart on the road behind him
Supposing that it was his sister coming back from one of her farms he kept on with his work
The cart stopped at the gate and a merry contralto voice called Almost through Emil
He dropped his scythe and went toward the fence wiping his face and neck with his handkerchief
In the cart sat a young woman who wore driving gauntlets and a wide shade hat trimmed with red poppies
Her face too was rather like a poppy round and brown with rich color in her cheeks and lips and her dancing yellowbrown eyes bubbled with gayety
The wind was flap ping her big hat and teasing a curl of her chestnutcolored hair
She shook her head at the tall youth
What time did you get over here
Thats not much of a job for an athlete
Here Ive been to town and back
Alexandra lets you sleep late
Oh I know
Lous wife was telling me about the way she spoils you
I was going to give you a lift if you were done
She gath ered up her reins
But I will be in a minute
Please wait for me Marie Emil coaxed
Alexandra sent me to mow our lot but Ive done half a dozen others you see
Just wait till I finish off the Kourdnas
By the way they were Bohemians
Why arent they up in the Catholic grave yard
Freethinkers replied the young woman laconically
Lots of the Bohemian boys at the Univer sity are said Emil taking up his scythe again
What did you ever burn John Huss for any way
Its made an awful row
They still jaw about it in history classes
Wed do it right over again most of us said the young woman hotly
Dont they ever teach you in your history classes that youd all be heathen Turks if it hadnt been for the Bohemians
Emil had fallen to mowing
Oh theres no denying youre a spunky little bunch you Czechs he called back over his shoulder
Marie Shabata settled herself in her seat and watched the rhythmical movement of the young mans long arms swinging her foot as if in time to some air that was going through her mind
The minutes passed
Emil mowed vigorously and Marie sat sunning herself and watching the long grass fall
She sat with the ease that belongs to persons of an essentially happy nature who can find a comfortable spot almost anywhere who are supple and quick in adapting themselves to circumstances
After a final swish Emil snapped the gate and sprang into the cart holding his scythe well out over the wheel
There he sighed
I gave old man Lee a cut or so too
Lous wife neednt talk
I never see Lous scythe over here
Marie clucked to her horse
Oh you know Annie
She looked at the young mans bare arms
How brown youve got since you came home
I wish I had an athlete to mow my orchard
I get wet to my knees when I go down to pick cherries
You can have one any time you want him
Better wait until after it rains
Emil squinted off at the horizon as if he were looking for clouds
Will you
Oh theres a good boy
She turned her head to him with a quick bright smile
He felt it rather than saw it
Indeed he had looked away with the purpose of not see ing it
Ive been up looking at Angeliques wedding clothes Marie went on and Im so excited I can hardly wait until Sunday
Ame dee will be a handsome bridegroom
Is any body but you going to stand up with him
Well then it will be a handsome wedding party
She made a droll face at Emil who flushed
Frank Marie continued flicking her horse is cranky at me because I loaned his saddle to Jan Smirka and Im terribly afraid he wont take me to the dance in the evening
Maybe the supper will tempt him
All Angeliques folks are baking for it and all Amedees twenty cousins
There will be barrels of beer
If once I get Frank to the supper Ill see that I stay for the dance
And by the way Emil you mustnt dance with me but once or twice
You must dance with all the French girls
It hurts their feelings if you dont
They think youre proud because youve been away to school or something
Emil sniffed
How do you know they think that
Well you didnt dance with them much at Raoul Marcels party and I could tell how they took it by the way they looked at youand at me
All right said Emil shortly studying the glittering blade of his scythe
They drove westward toward Norway Creek and toward a big white house that stood on a hill several miles across the fields
There were so many sheds and outbuildings grouped about it that the place looked not unlike a tiny village
A stranger approaching it could not help notic ing the beauty and fruitfulness of the outlying fields
There was something individual about the great farm a most unusual trimness and care for detail
On either side of the road for a mile before you reached the foot of the hill stood tall osage orange hedges their glossy green marking off the yellow fields
South of the hill in a low sheltered swale surrounded by a mulberry hedge was the orchard its fruit trees kneedeep in timothy grass
Any one there abouts would have told you that this was one of the richest farms on the Divide and that the farmer was a woman Alexandra Bergson
If you go up the hill and enter Alexandras big house you will find that it is curiously unfinished and uneven in comfort
One room is papered carpeted overfurnished the next is almost bare
The pleasantest rooms in the house are the kitchenwhere Alexandras three young Swedish girls chatter and cook and pickle and preserve all summer longand the sittingroom in which Alexandra has brought together the old homely furniture that the Bergsons used in their first log house the fam ily portraits and the few things her mother brought from Sweden
When you go out of the house into the flower garden there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm in the fencing and hedging in the windbreaks and sheds in the symmetrical pasture ponds planted with scrub willows to give shade to the cattle in flytime
There is even a white row of beehives in the orchard under the walnut trees
You feel that properly Alexandras house is the big outofdoors and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best
II Emil reached home a little past noon and when he went into the kitchen Alexandra was already seated at the head of the long table having dinner with her men as she always did unless there were visitors
He slipped into his empty place at his sisters right
The three pretty young Swedish girls who did Alexandras housework were cutting pies refilling coffee cups placing platters of bread and meat and potatoes upon the red tablecloth and continu ally getting in each others way between the table and the stove
To be sure they always wasted a good deal of time getting in each others way and giggling at each others mistakes
But as Alexandra had pointedly told her sistersin law it was to hear them giggle that she kept three young things in her kitchen the work she could do herself if it were necessary
These girls with their long letters from home their finery and their loveaffairs afforded her a great deal of entertainment and they were com pany for her when Emil was away at school
Of the youngest girl Signa who has a pretty figure mottled pink cheeks and yellow hair Alexandra is very fond though she keeps a sharp eye upon her
Signa is apt to be skittish at mealtime when the men are about and to spill the coffee or upset the cream
It is sup posed that Nelse Jensen one of the six men at the dinnertable is courting Signa though he has been so careful not to commit himself that no one in the house least of all Signa can tell just how far the matter has progressed
Nelse watches her glumly as she waits upon the table and in the evening he sits on a bench behind the stove with his DRAGHARMONIKA playing mournful airs and watching her as she goes about her work
When Alexandra asked Signa whether she thought Nelse was in earnest the poor child hid her hands under her apron and murmured I dont know mam
But he scolds me about everything like as if he wanted to have me
At Alexandras left sat a very old man bare foot and wearing a long blue blouse open at the neck
His shaggy head is scarcely whiter than it was sixteen years ago but his little blue eyes have become pale and watery and his ruddy face is withered like an apple that has clung all winter to the tree
When Ivar lost his land through mismanagement a dozen years ago Alexandra took him in and he has been a mem ber of her household ever since
He is too old to work in the fields but he hitches and unhitches the workteams and looks after the health of the stock
Sometimes of a winter evening Alexandra calls him into the sittingroom to read the Bible aloud to her for he still reads very well
He dislikes human habitations so Alexandra has fitted him up a room in the barn where he is very comfortable being near the horses and as he says further from tempta tions
No one has ever found out what his temptations are
In cold weather he sits by the kitchen fire and makes hammocks or mends harness until it is time to go to bed
Then he says his prayers at great length behind the stove puts on his buffaloskin coat and goes out to his room in the barn
Alexandra herself has changed very little
Her figure is fuller and she has more color
She seems sunnier and more vigorous than she did as a young girl
But she still has the same calmness and deliberation of manner the same clear eyes and she still wears her hair in two braids wound round her head
It is so curly that fiery ends escape from the braids and make her head look like one of the big double sunflowers that fringe her vegetable garden
Her face is always tanned in summer for her sunbonnet is oftener on her arm than on her head
But where her collar falls away from her neck or where her sleeves are pushed back from her wrist the skin is of such smoothness and whiteness as none but Swedish women ever possess skin with the freshness of the snow itself
Alexandra did not talk much at the table but she encouraged her men to talk and she always listened attentively even when they seemed to be talking foolishly
Today Barney Flinn the big redheaded Irishman who had been with Alexandra for five years and who was actually her foreman though he had no such title was grumbling about the new silo she had put up that spring
It hap pened to be the first silo on the Divide and Alexandras neighbors and her men were skep tical about it
To be sure if the thing dont work well have plenty of feed without it indeed Barney conceded
Nelse Jensen Signas gloomy suitor had his word
Lou he says he wouldnt have no silo on his place if youd give it to him
He says the feed outen it gives the stock the bloat
He heard of somebody lost four head of horses feedin em that stuff
Alexandra looked down the table from one to another
Well the only way we can find out is to try
Lou and I have different notions about feeding stock and thats a good thing
Its bad if all the members of a family think alike
They never get anywhere
Lou can learn by my mistakes and I can learn by his
Isnt that fair Barney
The Irishman laughed
He had no love for Lou who was always uppish with him and who said that Alexandra paid her hands too much
Ive no thought but to give the thing an honest try mum
T would be only right after puttin so much expense into it
Maybe Emil will come out an have a look at it wid me
He pushed back his chair took his hat from the nail and marched out with Emil who with his univer sity ideas was supposed to have instigated the silo
The other hands followed them all except old Ivar
He had been depressed throughout the meal and had paid no heed to the talk of the men even when they mentioned cornstalk bloat upon which he was sure to have opinions
Did you want to speak to me Ivar
Alex andra asked as she rose from the table
Come into the sittingroom
The old man followed Alexandra but when she motioned him to a chair he shook his head
She took up her workbasket and waited for him to speak
He stood looking at the car pet his bushy head bowed his hands clasped in front of him
Ivars bandy legs seemed to have grown shorter with years and they were com pletely misfitted to his broad thick body and heavy shoulders
Well Ivar what is it
Alexandra asked after she had waited longer than usual
Ivar had never learned to speak English and his Norwegian was quaint and grave like the speech of the more oldfashioned people
He always addressed Alexandra in terms of the deepest respect hoping to set a good example to the kitchen girls whom he thought too fam iliar in their manners
Mistress he began faintly without raising his eyes the folk have been looking coldly at me of late
You know there has been talk
Talk about what Ivar
About sending me away to the asylum
Alexandra put down her sewingbasket
Nobody has come to me with such talk she said decidedly
Why need you listen
You know I would never consent to such a thing
Ivar lifted his shaggy head and looked at her out of his little eyes
They say that you can not prevent it if the folk complain of me if your brothers complain to the authorities
They say that your brothers are afraidGod forbid that I may do you some injury when my spells are on me
Mistress how can any one think thatthat I could bite the hand that fed me
The tears trickled down on the old mans beard
Alexandra frowned
Ivar I wonder at you that you should come bothering me with such nonsense
I am still running my own house and other people have nothing to do with either you or me
So long as I am suited with you there is nothing to be said
Ivar pulled a red handkerchief out of the breast of his blouse and wiped his eyes and beard
But I should not wish you to keep me if as they say it is against your interests and if it is hard for you to get hands because I am here
Alexandra made an impatient gesture but the old man put out his hand and went on earnestly Listen mistress it is right that you should take these things into account
You know that my spells come from God and that I would not harm any living creature
You believe that every one should worship God in the way revealed to him
But that is not the way of this country
The way here is for all to do alike
I am despised because I do not wear shoes because I do not cut my hair and because I have visions
At home in the old country there were many like me who had been touched by God or who had seen things in the grave yard at night and were different afterward
We thought nothing of it and let them alone
But here if a man is different in his feet or in his head they put him in the asylum
Look at Peter Kralik when he was a boy drinking out of a creek he swallowed a snake and always after that he could eat only such food as the creature liked for when he ate anything else it became enraged and gnawed him
When he felt it whipping about in him he drank alcohol to stupefy it and get some ease for himself
He could work as good as any man and his head was clear but they locked him up for being different in his stomach
That is the way they have built the asylum for people who are dif ferent and they will not even let us live in the holes with the badgers
Only your great pros perity has protected me so far
If you had had illfortune they would have taken me to Has tings long ago
As Ivar talked his gloom lifted
Alexandra had found that she could often break his fasts and long penances by talking to him and let ting him pour out the thoughts that troubled him
Sympathy always cleared his mind and ridicule was poison to him
There is a great deal in what you say Ivar
Like as not they will be wanting to take me to Hastings because I have built a silo and then I may take you with me
But at present I need you here
Only dont come to me again telling me what people say
Let people go on talking as they like and we will go on living as we think best
You have been with me now for twelve years and I have gone to you for advice oftener than I have ever gone to any one
That ought to satisfy you
Ivar bowed humbly
Yes mistress I shall not trouble you with their talk again
And as for my feet I have observed your wishes all these years though you have never questioned me washing them every night even in winter
Alexandra laughed
Oh never mind about your feet Ivar
We can remember when half our neighbors went barefoot in summer
I ex pect old Mrs Lee would love to slip her shoes off now sometimes if she dared
Im glad Im not Lous motherinlaw
Ivar looked about mysteriously and lowered his voice almost to a whisper
You know what they have over at Lous house
A great white tub like the stone watertroughs in the old country to wash themselves in
When you sent me over with the strawberries they were all in town but the old woman Lee and the baby
She took me in and showed me the thing and she told me it was impossible to wash yourself clean in it because in so much water you could not make a strong suds
So when they fill it up and send her in there she pretends and makes a splashing noise
Then when they are all asleep she washes herself in a little wooden tub she keeps under her bed
Alexandra shook with laughter
Poor old Mrs Lee
They wont let her wear nightcaps either
Never mind when she comes to visit me she can do all the old things in the old way and have as much beer as she wants
Well start an asylum for oldtime people Ivar
Ivar folded his big handkerchief carefully and thrust it back into his blouse
This is always the way mistress
I come to you sor rowing and you send me away with a light heart
And will you be so good as to tell the Irishman that he is not to work the brown gelding until the sore on its shoulder is healed
That I will
Now go and put Emils mare to the cart
I am going to drive up to the north quarter to meet the man from town who is to buy my alfalfa hay
III Alexandra was to hear more of Ivars case however
On Sunday her married brothers came to dinner
She had asked them for that day because Emil who hated family parties would be absent dancing at Amedee Chevaliers wedding up in the French country
The table was set for company in the diningroom where highly varnished wood and colored glass and useless pieces of china were conspicuous enough to satisfy the standards of the new prosperity
Alexandra had put herself into the hands of the Hanover furniture dealer and he had conscien tiously done his best to make her diningroom look like his display window
She said frankly that she knew nothing about such things and she was willing to be governed by the general conviction that the more useless and utterly unusable objects were the greater their virtue as ornament
That seemed reasonable enough
Since she liked plain things herself it was all the more necessary to have jars and punch bowls and candlesticks in the company rooms for people who did appreciate them
Her guests liked to see about them these reassuring emblems of prosperity
The family party was complete except for Emil and Oscars wife who in the country phrase was not going anywhere just now
Oscar sat at the foot of the table and his four towheaded little boys aged from twelve to five were ranged at one side
Neither Oscar nor Lou has changed much they have simply as Alexandra said of them long ago grown to be more and more like themselves
Lou now looks the older of the two his face is thin and shrewd and wrinkled about the eyes while Oscars is thick and dull
For all his dullness however Oscar makes more money than his brother which adds to Lous sharpness and uneasiness and tempts him to make a show
The trouble with Lou is that he is tricky and his neighbors have found out that as Ivar says he has not a foxs face for nothing
Politics being the nat ural field for such talents he neglects his farm to attend conventions and to run for county offices
Lous wife formerly Annie Lee has grown to look curiously like her husband
Her face has become longer sharper more aggressive
She wears her yellow hair in a high pompadour and is bedecked with rings and chains and beauty pins
Her tight highheeled shoes give her an awkward walk and she is always more or less preoccupied with her clothes
As she sat at the table she kept telling her young est daughter to be careful now and not drop anything on mother
The conversation at the table was all in Eng lish
Oscars wife from the malaria district of Missouri was ashamed of marrying a foreigner and his boys do not understand a word of Swedish
Annie and Lou sometimes speak Swedish at home but Annie is almost as much afraid of being caught at it as ever her mother was of being caught barefoot
Oscar still has a thick accent but Lou speaks like anybody from Iowa
When I was in Hastings to attend the con vention he was saying I saw the superin tendent of the asylum and I was telling him about Ivars symptoms
He says Ivars case is one of the most dangerous kind and its a wonder he hasnt done something violent before this
Alexandra laughed goodhumoredly
Oh nonsense Lou
The doctors would have us all crazy if they could
Ivars queer certainly but he has more sense than half the hands I hire
Lou flew at his fried chicken
Oh I guess the doctor knows his business Alexandra
He was very much surprised when I told him how youd put up with Ivar
He says hes likely to set fire to the barn any night or to take after you and the girls with an axe
Little Signa who was waiting on the table giggled and fled to the kitchen
Alexandras eyes twinkled
That was too much for Signa Lou
We all know that Ivars perfectly harm less
The girls would as soon expect me to chase them with an axe
Lou flushed and signaled to his wife
All the same the neighbors will be having a say about it before long
He may burn anybodys barn
Its only necessary for one property owner in the township to make complaint and hell be taken up by force
Youd better send him yourself and not have any hard feelings
Alexandra helped one of her little nephews to gravy
Well Lou if any of the neighbors try that Ill have myself appointed Ivars guardian and take the case to court thats all
I am perfectly satisfied with him
Pass the preserves Lou said Annie in a warning tone
She had reasons for not wishing her husband to cross Alexandra too openly
But dont you sort of hate to have people see him around here Alexandra
she went on with persuasive smoothness
He IS a disgrace ful object and youre fixed up so nice now
It sort of makes people distant with you when they never know when theyll hear him scratch ing about
My girls are afraid as death of him arent you Milly dear
Milly was fifteen fat and jolly and pompa doured with a creamy complexion square white teeth and a short upper lip
She looked like her grandmother Bergson and had her comfortable and comfortloving nature
She grinned at her aunt with whom she was a great deal more at ease than she was with her mother
Alexandra winked a reply
Milly neednt be afraid of Ivar
Shes an especial favorite of his
In my opinion Ivar has just as much right to his own way of dressing and thinking as we have
But Ill see that he doesnt bother other people
Ill keep him at home so dont trouble any more about him Lou
Ive been wanting to ask you about your new bathtub
How does it work
Annie came to the fore to give Lou time to recover himself
Oh it works something grand
I cant keep him out of it
He washes himself all over three times a week now and uses all the hot water
I think its weakening to stay in as long as he does
You ought to have one Alexandra
Im thinking of it
I might have one put in the barn for Ivar if it will ease peoples minds
But before I get a bathtub Im going to get a piano for Milly
Oscar at the end of the table looked up from his plate
What does Milly want of a pianny
Whats the matter with her organ
She can make some use of that and play in church
Annie looked flustered
She had begged Alexandra not to say anything about this plan before Oscar who was apt to be jealous of what his sister did for Lous children
Alexandra did not get on with Oscars wife at all
Milly can play in church just the same and shell still play on the organ
But practising on it so much spoils her touch
Her teacher says so Annie brought out with spirit
Oscar rolled his eyes
Well Milly must have got on pretty good if shes got past the organ
I know plenty of grown folks that aint he said bluntly
Annie threw up her chin
She has got on good and shes going to play for her commence ment when she graduates in town next year
Yes said Alexandra firmly I think Milly deserves a piano
All the girls around here have been taking lessons for years but Milly is the only one of them who can ever play anything when you ask her
Ill tell you when I first thought I would like to give you a piano Milly and that was when you learned that book of old Swedish songs that your grandfather used to sing
He had a sweet tenor voice and when he was a young man he loved to sing
I can remember hearing him singing with the sailors down in the shipyard when I was no bigger than Stella here pointing to Annies younger daughter
Milly and Stella both looked through the door into the sittingroom where a crayon por trait of John Bergson hung on the wall
Alex andra had had it made from a little photograph taken for his friends just before he left Sweden a slender man of thirtyfive with soft hair curl ing about his high forehead a drooping mus tache and wondering sad eyes that looked forward into the distance as if they already beheld the New World
After dinner Lou and Oscar went to the orchard to pick cherriesthey had neither of them had the patience to grow an orchard of their ownand Annie went down to gossip with Alexandras kitchen girls while they washed the dishes
She could always find out more about Alexandras domestic economy from the prat tling maids than from Alexandra herself and what she discovered she used to her own advan tage with Lou
On the Divide farmers daugh ters no longer went out into service so Alex andra got her girls from Sweden by paying their fare over
They stayed with her until they married and were replaced by sisters or cousins from the old country
Alexandra took her three nieces into the flower garden
She was fond of the little girls especially of Milly who came to spend a week with her aunt now and then and read aloud to her from the old books about the house or listened to stories about the early days on the Divide
While they were walking among the flower beds a buggy drove up the hill and stopped in front of the gate
A man got out and stood talking to the driver
The little girls were delighted at the advent of a stranger some one from very far away they knew by his clothes his gloves and the sharp pointed cut of his dark beard
The girls fell behind their aunt and peeped out at him from among the castor beans
The stranger came up to the gate and stood holding his hat in his hand smiling while Alexandra advanced slowly to meet him
As she approached he spoke in a low pleasant voice
Dont you know me Alexandra
I would have known you anywhere
Alexandra shaded her eyes with her hand
Suddenly she took a quick step forward
Can it be
she exclaimed with feeling can it be that it is Carl Linstrum
Why Carl it is
She threw out both her hands and caught his across the gate
Sadie Milly run tell your father and Uncle Oscar that our old friend Carl Linstrum is here
Be quick
Why Carl how did it happen
I cant believe this
Alexan dra shook the tears from her eyes and laughed
The stranger nodded to his driver dropped his suitcase inside the fence and opened the gate
Then you are glad to see me and you can put me up overnight
I couldnt go through this country without stopping off to have a look at you
How little you have changed
Do you know I was sure it would be like that
You simply couldnt be different
How fine you are
He stepped back and looked at her admiringly
Alexandra blushed and laughed again
But you yourself Carlwith that beardhow could I have known you
You went away a little boy
She reached for his suitcase and when he intercepted her she threw up her hands
You see I give myself away
I have only women come to visit me and I do not know how to behave
Where is your trunk
Its in Hanover
I can stay only a few days
I am on my way to the coast
They started up the path
A few days
After all these years
Alexandra shook her finger at him
See this you have walked into a trap
You do not get away so easy
She put her hand affectionately on his shoulder
You owe me a visit for the sake of old times
Why must you go to the coast at all
Oh I must
I am a fortune hunter
From Seattle I go on to Alaska
Alaska
She looked at him in astonish ment
Are you going to paint the Indians
Paint
the young man frowned
Oh
Im not a painter Alexandra
Im an engraver
I have nothing to do with painting
But on my parlor wall I have the paint ings He interrupted nervously
Oh watercolor sketchesdone for amusement
I sent them to remind you of me not because they were good
What a wonderful place you have made of this Alexandra
He turned and looked back at the wide maplike prospect of field and hedge and pasture
I would never have believed it could be done
Im disappointed in my own eye in my imagination
At this moment Lou and Oscar came up the hill from the orchard
They did not quicken their pace when they saw Carl indeed they did not openly look in his direction
They advanced distrustfully and as if they wished the distance were longer
Alexandra beckoned to them
They think I am trying to fool them
Come boys its Carl Linstrum our old Carl
Lou gave the visitor a quick sidelong glance and thrust out his hand
Glad to see you
Oscar followed with How d do
Carl could not tell whether their offishness came from unfriendliness or from embarrassment
He and Alexandra led the way to the porch
Carl Alexandra explained is on his way to Seattle
He is going to Alaska
Oscar studied the visitors yellow shoes
Got business there
he asked
Carl laughed
Yes very pressing business
Im going there to get rich
Engravings a very interesting profession but a man never makes any money at it
So Im going to try the gold fields
Alexandra felt that this was a tactful speech and Lou looked up with some interest
Ever done anything in that line before
No but Im going to join a friend of mine who went out from New York and has done well
He has offered to break me in
Turrible cold winters there I hear re marked Oscar
I thought people went up there in the spring
They do
But my friend is going to spend the winter in Seattle and I am to stay with him there and learn something about prospecting before we start north next year
Lou looked skeptical
Lets see how long have you been away from here
Sixteen years
You ought to remember that Lou for you were married just after we went away
Going to stay with us some time
Oscar asked
A few days if Alexandra can keep me
I expect youll be wanting to see your old place Lou observed more cordially
You wont hardly know it
But theres a few chunks of your old sod house left
Alexandra wouldnt never let Frank Shabata plough over it
Annie Lee who ever since the visitor was announced had been touching up her hair and settling her lace and wishing she had worn another dress now emerged with her three daughters and introduced them
She was greatly impressed by Carls urban appearance and in her excitement talked very loud and threw her head about
And you aint married yet
At your age now
Think of that
Youll have to wait for Milly
Yes weve got a boy too
The youngest
Hes at home with his grandma
You must come over to see mother and hear Milly play
Shes the musician of the family
She does pyrography too
Thats burnt wood you know
You wouldnt believe what she can do with her poker
Yes she goes to school in town and she is the youngest in her class by two years
Milly looked uncomfortable and Carl took her hand again
He liked her creamy skin and happy innocent eyes and he could see that her mothers way of talking distressed her
Im sure shes a clever little girl he murmured looking at her thoughtfully
Let me see Ah its your mother that she looks like Alex andra
Mrs Bergson must have looked just like this when she was a little girl
Does Milly run about over the country as you and Alex andra used to Annie
Millys mother protested
Oh my no
Things has changed since we was girls
Milly has it very different
We are going to rent the place and move into town as soon as the girls are old enough to go out into company
A good many are doing that here now
Lou is going into business
Lou grinned
Thats what she says
You better go get your things on
Ivars hitching up he added turning to Annie
Young farmers seldom address their wives by name
It is always you or she
Having got his wife out of the way Lou sat down on the step and began to whittle
Well what do folks in New York think of William Jennings Bryan
Lou began to bluster as he always did when he talked politics
We gave Wall Street a scare in ninetysix all right and were fixing another to hand them
Silver wasnt the only issue he nodded mysteriously
Theres a good many things got to be changed
The West is going to make itself heard
Carl laughed
But surely it did do that if nothing else
Lous thin face reddened up to the roots of his bristly hair
Oh weve only begun
Were waking up to a sense of our responsibilities out here and we aint afraid neither
You fellows back there must be a tame lot
If you had any nerve youd get together and march down to Wall Street and blow it up
Dyna mite it I mean with a threatening nod
He was so much in earnest that Carl scarcely knew how to answer him
That would be a waste of powder
The same business would go on in another street
The street doesnt matter
But what have you fellows out here got to kick about
You have the only safe place there is
Morgan himself couldnt touch you
One only has to drive through this country to see that youre all as rich as barons
We have a good deal more to say than we had when we were poor said Lou threateningly
Were getting on to a whole lot of things
As Ivar drove a double carriage up to the gate Annie came out in a hat that looked like the model of a battleship
Carl rose and took her down to the carriage while Lou lingered for a word with his sister
What do you suppose hes come for
he asked jerking his head toward the gate
Why to pay us a visit
Ive been begging him to for years
Oscar looked at Alexandra
He didnt let you know he was coming
No
Why should he
I told him to come at any time
Lou shrugged his shoulders
He doesnt seem to have done much for himself
Wander ing around this way
Oscar spoke solemnly as from the depths of a cavern
He never was much account
Alexandra left them and hurried down to the gate where Annie was rattling on to Carl about her new diningroom furniture
You must bring Mr Linstrum over real soon only be sure to telephone me first she called back as Carl helped her into the carriage
Old Ivar his white head bare stood holding the horses
Lou came down the path and climbed into the front seat took up the reins and drove off without saying anything further to any one
Oscar picked up his youngest boy and trudged off down the road the other three trotting after him
Carl holding the gate open for Alexandra began to laugh
Up and coming on the Divide eh Alexandra
he cried gayly
IV Carl had changed Alexandra felt much less than one might have expected
He had not become a trim selfsatisfied city man
There was still something homely and wayward and definitely personal about him
Even his clothes his Norfolk coat and his very high collars were a little unconventional
He seemed to shrink into himself as he used to do to hold him self away from things as if he were afraid of being hurt
In short he was more selfcon scious than a man of thirtyfive is expected to be
He looked older than his years and not very strong
His black hair which still hung in a triangle over his pale forehead was thin at the crown and there were fine relentless lines about his eyes
His back with its high sharp shoulders looked like the back of an over worked German professor off on his holiday
His face was intelligent sensitive unhappy
That evening after supper Carl and Alex andra were sitting by the clump of castor beans in the middle of the flower garden
The gravel paths glittered in the moonlight and below them the fields lay white and still
Do you know Alexandra he was saying Ive been thinking how strangely things work out
Ive been away engraving other mens pictures and youve stayed at home and made your own
He pointed with his cigar toward the sleeping landscape
How in the world have you done it
How have your neighbors done it
We hadnt any of us much to do with it Carl
The land did it
It had its little joke
It pretended to be poor because nobody knew how to work it right and then all at once it worked itself
It woke up out of its sleep and stretched itself and it was so big so rich that we sud denly found we were rich just from sitting still
As for me you remember when I began to buy land
For years after that I was always squeez ing and borrowing until I was ashamed to show my face in the banks
And then all at once men began to come to me offering to lend me moneyand I didnt need it
Then I went ahead and built this house
I really built it for Emil
I want you to see Emil Carl
He is so different from the rest of us
How different
Oh youll see
Im sure it was to have sons like Emil and to give them a chance that father left the old country
Its curious too on the outside Emil is just like an American boyhe graduated from the State University in June you knowbut underneath he is more Swed ish than any of us
Sometimes he is so like father that he frightens me he is so violent in his feel ings like that
Is he going to farm here with you
He shall do whatever he wants to Alex andra declared warmly
He is going to have a chance a whole chance thats what Ive worked for
Sometimes he talks about studying law and sometimes just lately hes been talk ing about going out into the sand hills and tak ing up more land
He has his sad times like father
But I hope he wont do that
We have land enough at last
Alexandra laughed
How about Lou and Oscar
Theyve done well havent they
Yes very well but they are different and now that they have farms of their own I do not see so much of them
We divided the land equally when Lou married
They have their own way of doing things and they do not alto gether like my way I am afraid
Perhaps they think me too independent
But I have had to think for myself a good many years and am not likely to change
On the whole though we take as much comfort in each other as most brothers and sisters do
And I am very fond of Lous oldest daughter
I think I liked the old Lou and Oscar better and they probably feel the same about me
I even if you can keep a secretCarl leaned forward and touched her arm smilingI even think I liked the old country better
This is all very splendid in its way but there was something about this country when it was a wild old beast that has haunted me all these years
Now when I come back to all this milk and honey I feel like the old German song Wo bist du wo bist du mein geliebtest Land
 Do you ever feel like that I wonder
Yes sometimes when I think about father and mother and those who are gone so many of our old neighbors
Alexandra paused and looked up thoughtfully at the stars
We can remember the graveyard when it was wild prairie Carl and now And now the old story has begun to write itself over there said Carl softly
Isnt it queer there are only two or three human stories and they go on repeating themselves as fiercely as if they had never happened before like the larks in this country that have been singing the same five notes over for thousands of years
Oh yes
The young people they live so hard
And yet I sometimes envy them
There is my little neighbor now the people who bought your old place
I wouldnt have sold it to any one else but I was always fond of that girl
You must remember her little Marie Tovesky from Omaha who used to visit here
When she was eighteen she ran away from the convent school and got married crazy child
She came out here a bride with her father and husband
He had nothing and the old man was willing to buy them a place and set them up
Your farm took her fancy and I was glad to have her so near me
Ive never been sorry either
I even try to get along with Frank on her account
Is Frank her husband
Yes
Hes one of these wild fellows
Most Bohemians are goodnatured but Frank thinks we dont appreciate him here I guess
Hes jeal ous about everything his farm and his horses and his pretty wife
Everybody likes her just the same as when she was little
Sometimes I go up to the Catholic church with Emil and its funny to see Marie standing there laughing and shaking hands with people looking so ex cited and gay with Frank sulking behind her as if he could eat everybody alive
Franks not a bad neighbor but to get on with him youve got to make a fuss over him and act as if you thought he was a very important person all the time and different from other people
I find it hard to keep that up from one years end to another
I shouldnt think youd be very successful at that kind of thing Alexandra
Carl seemed to find the idea amusing
Well said Alexandra firmly I do the best I can on Maries account
She has it hard enough anyway
Shes too young and pretty for this sort of life
Were all ever so much older and slower
But shes the kind that wont be downed easily
Shell work all day and go to a Bohemian wedding and dance all night and drive the hay wagon for a cross man next morn ing
I could stay by a job but I never had the go in me that she has when I was going my best
Ill have to take you over to see her tomorrow
Carl dropped the end of his cigar softly among the castor beans and sighed
Yes I suppose I must see the old place
Im cow ardly about things that remind me of myself
It took courage to come at all Alexandra
I wouldnt have if I hadnt wanted to see you very very much
Alexandra looked at him with her calm deliberate eyes
Why do you dread things like that Carl
she asked earnestly
Why are you dissatisfied with yourself
Her visitor winced
How direct you are Alexandra
Just like you used to be
Do I give myself away so quickly
Well you see for one thing theres nothing to look forward to in my profession
Woodengraving is the only thing I care about and that had gone out before I began
Everythings cheap metal work now adays touching up miserable photographs forcing up poor drawings and spoiling good ones
Im absolutely sick of it all
Carl frowned
Alexandra all the way out from New York Ive been planning how I could de ceive you and make you think me a very envi able fellow and here I am telling you the truth the first night
I waste a lot of time pre tending to people and the joke of it is I dont think I ever deceive any one
There are too many of my kind people know us on sight
Carl paused
Alexandra pushed her hair back from her brow with a puzzled thoughtful gesture
You see he went on calmly mea sured by your standards here Im a failure
I couldnt buy even one of your cornfields
Ive enjoyed a great many things but Ive got nothing to show for it all
But you show for it yourself Carl
Id rather have had your freedom than my land
Carl shook his head mournfully
Freedom so often means that one isnt needed anywhere
Here you are an individual you have a back ground of your own you would be missed
But off there in the cities there are thousands of rolling stones like me
We are all alike we have no ties we know nobody we own nothing
When one of us dies they scarcely know where to bury him
Our landlady and the delicatessen man are our mourners and we leave nothing behind us but a frockcoat and a fiddle or an easel or a typewriter or whatever tool we got our living by
All we have ever managed to do is to pay our rent the exorbitant rent that one has to pay for a few square feet of space near the heart of things
We have no house no place no people of our own
We live in the streets in the parks in the theatres
We sit in restaurants and concert halls and look about at the hundreds of our own kind and shudder
Alexandra was silent
She sat looking at the silver spot the moon made on the surface of the pond down in the pasture
He knew that she understood what he meant
At last she said slowly And yet I would rather have Emil grow up like that than like his two brothers
We pay a high rent too though we pay differ ently
We grow hard and heavy here
We dont move lightly and easily as you do and our minds get stiff
If the world were no wider than my cornfields if there were not something beside this I wouldnt feel that it was much worth while to work
No I would rather have Emil like you than like them
I felt that as soon as you came
I wonder why you feel like that
Carl mused
I dont know
Perhaps I am like Carrie Jensen the sister of one of my hired men
She had never been out of the cornfields and a few years ago she got despondent and said life was just the same thing over and over and she didnt see the use of it
After she had tried to kill herself once or twice her folks got wor ried and sent her over to Iowa to visit some relations
Ever since shes come back shes been perfectly cheerful and she says shes con tented to live and work in a world thats so big and interesting
She said that anything as big as the bridges over the Platte and the Missouri reconciled her
And its what goes on in the world that reconciles me
V Alexandra did not find time to go to her neighbors the next day nor the next
It was a busy season on the farm with the cornplowing going on and even Emil was in the field with a team and cultivator
Carl went about over the farms with Alexandra in the morning and in the afternoon and evening they found a great deal to talk about
Emil for all his track prac tice did not stand up under farmwork very well and by night he was too tired to talk or even to practise on his cornet
On Wednesday morning Carl got up before it was light and stole downstairs and out of the kitchen door just as old Ivar was making his morning ablutions at the pump
Carl nodded to him and hurried up the draw past the gar den and into the pasture where the milking cows used to be kept
The dawn in the east looked like the light from some great fire that was burning under the edge of the world
The color was reflected in the globules of dew that sheathed the short gray pasture grass
Carl walked rapidly until he came to the crest of the second hill where the Bergson pasture joined the one that had belonged to his father
There he sat down and waited for the sun to rise
It was just there that he and Alexandra used to do their milking together he on his side of the fence she on hers
He could remember exactly how she looked when she came over the closecropped grass her skirts pinned up her head bare a bright tin pail in either hand and the milky light of the early morning all about her
Even as a boy he used to feel when he saw her coming with her free step her upright head and calm shoulders that she looked as if she had walked straight out of the morning itself
Since then when he had happened to see the sun come up in the country or on the water he had often remem bered the young Swedish girl and her milking pails
Carl sat musing until the sun leaped above the prairie and in the grass about him all the small creatures of day began to tune their tiny instruments
Birds and insects without num ber began to chirp to twitter to snap and whistle to make all manner of fresh shrill noises
The pasture was flooded with light every clump of ironweed and snowonthe mountain threw a long shadow and the golden light seemed to be rippling through the curly grass like the tide racing in
He crossed the fence into the pasture that was now the Shabatas and continued his walk toward the pond
He had not gone far how ever when he discovered that he was not the only person abroad
In the draw below his gun in his hands was Emil advancing cautiously with a young woman beside him
They were moving softly keeping close together and Carl knew that they expected to find ducks on the pond
At the moment when they came in sight of the bright spot of water he heard a whirr of wings and the ducks shot up into the air
There was a sharp crack from the gun and five of the birds fell to the ground
Emil and his companion laughed delightedly and Emil ran to pick them up
When he came back dangling the ducks by their feet Marie held her apron and he dropped them into it
As she stood looking down at them her face changed
She took up one of the birds a rumpled ball of feathers with the blood dripping slowly from its mouth and looked at the live color that still burned on its plumage
As she let it fall she cried in distress Oh Emil why did you
I like that
the boy exclaimed indignantly
Why Marie you asked me to come yourself
Yes yes I know she said tearfully but I didnt think
I hate to see them when they are first shot
They were having such a good time and weve spoiled it all for them
Emil gave a rather sore laugh
I should say we had
Im not going hunting with you any more
Youre as bad as Ivar
Here let me take them
He snatched the ducks out of her apron
Dont be cross Emil
OnlyIvars right about wild things
Theyre too happy to kill
You can tell just how they felt when they flew up
They were scared but they didnt really think anything could hurt them
No we wont do that any more
All right Emil assented
Im sorry I made you feel bad
As he looked down into her tearful eyes there was a curious sharp young bitterness in his own
Carl watched them as they moved slowly down the draw
They had not seen him at all
He had not overheard much of their dialogue but he felt the import of it
It made him some how unreasonably mournful to find two young things abroad in the pasture in the early morn ing
He decided that he needed his breakfast
VI At dinner that day Alexandra said she thought they must really manage to go over to the Shabatas that afternoon
Its not often I let three days go by without seeing Marie
She will think I have forsaken her now that my old friend has come back
After the men had gone back to work Alex andra put on a white dress and her sunhat and she and Carl set forth across the fields
You see we have kept up the old path Carl
It has been so nice for me to feel that there was a friend at the other end of it again
Carl smiled a little ruefully
All the same I hope it hasnt been QUITE the same
Alexandra looked at him with surprise
Why no of course not
Not the same
She could not very well take your place if thats what you mean
Im friendly with all my neighbors I hope
But Marie is really a com panion some one I can talk to quite frankly
You wouldnt want me to be more lonely than I have been would you
Carl laughed and pushed back the triangular lock of hair with the edge of his hat
Of course I dont
I ought to be thankful that this path hasnt been worn bywell by friends with more pressing errands than your little Bohe mian is likely to have
He paused to give Alexandra his hand as she stepped over the stile
Are you the least bit disappointed in our com ing together again
he asked abruptly
Is it the way you hoped it would be
Alexandra smiled at this
Only better
When Ive thought about your coming Ive sometimes been a little afraid of it
You have lived where things move so fast and every thing is slow here the people slowest of all
Our lives are like the years all made up of weather and crops and cows
How you hated cows
She shook her head and laughed to herself
I didnt when we milked together
I walked up to the pasture corners this morning
I wonder whether I shall ever be able to tell you all that I was thinking about up there
Its a strange thing Alexandra I find it easy to be frank with you about everything under the sun exceptyourself
You are afraid of hurting my feelings per haps
Alexandra looked at him thoughtfully
No Im afraid of giving you a shock
Youve seen yourself for so long in the dull minds of the people about you that if I were to tell you how you seem to me it would startle you
But you must see that you astonish me
You must feel when people admire you
Alexandra blushed and laughed with some confusion
I felt that you were pleased with me if you mean that
And youve felt when other people were pleased with you
he insisted
Well sometimes
The men in town at the banks and the county offices seem glad to see me
I think myself it is more pleasant to do business with people who are clean and healthylooking she admitted blandly
Carl gave a little chuckle as he opened the Shabatas gate for her
Oh do you
he asked dryly
There was no sign of life about the Shabatas house except a big yellow cat sunning itself on the kitchen doorstep
Alexandra took the path that led to the orchard
She often sits there and sews
I didnt telephone her we were coming because I didnt her to go to work and bake cake and freeze icecream
Shell always make a party if you give her the least excuse
Do you recognize the apple trees Carl
Linstrum looked about him
I wish I had a dollar for every bucket of water Ive carried for those trees
Poor father he was an easy man but he was perfectly merciless when it came to watering the orchard
Thats one thing I like about Germans they make an orchard grow if they cant make anything else
Im so glad these trees belong to some one who takes comfort in them
When I rented this place the tenants never kept the orchard up and Emil and I used to come over and take care of it ourselves
It needs mowing now
There she is down in the corner
Ma riaaa
she called
A recumbent figure started up from the grass and came running toward them through the flickering screen of light and shade
Look at her
Isnt she like a little brown rabbit
Alexandra laughed
Maria ran up panting and threw her arms about Alexandra
Oh I had begun to think you were not coming at all maybe
I knew you were so busy
Yes Emil told me about Mr Linstrum being here
Wont you come up to the house
Why not sit down there in your corner
Carl wants to see the orchard
He kept all these trees alive for years watering them with his own back
Marie turned to Carl
Then Im thankful to you Mr Linstrum
Wed never have bought the place if it hadnt been for this orchard and then I wouldnt have had Alexandra either
She gave Alexandras arm a little squeeze as she walked beside her
How nice your dress smells Alexandra you put rosemary leaves in your chest like I told you
She led them to the northwest corner of the orchard sheltered on one side by a thick mul berry hedge and bordered on the other by a wheatfield just beginning to yellow
In this corner the ground dipped a little and the blue grass which the weeds had driven out in the upper part of the orchard grew thick and luxu riant
Wild roses were flaming in the tufts of bunchgrass along the fence
Under a white mulberry tree there was an old wagonseat
Beside it lay a book and a workbasket
You must have the seat Alexandra
The grass would stain your dress the hostess in sisted
She dropped down on the ground at Alexandras side and tucked her feet under her
Carl sat at a little distance from the two wo men his back to the wheatfield and watched them
Alexandra took off her shadehat and threw it on the ground
Marie picked it up and played with the white ribbons twisting them about her brown fingers as she talked
They made a pretty picture in the strong sunlight the leafy pattern surrounding them like a net the Swedish woman so white and gold kindly and amused but armored in calm and the alert brown one her full lips parted points of yel low light dancing in her eyes as she laughed and chattered
Carl had never forgotten little Marie Toveskys eyes and he was glad to have an opportunity to study them
The brown iris he found was curiously slashed with yel low the color of sunflower honey or of old amber
In each eye one of these streaks must have been larger than the others for the effect was that of two dancing points of light two little yellow bubbles such as rise in a glass of champagne
Sometimes they seemed like the sparks from a forge
She seemed so easily ex cited to kindle with a fierce little flame if one but breathed upon her
What a waste Carl reflected
She ought to be doing all that for a sweetheart
How awkwardly things come about
It was not very long before Marie sprang up out of the grass again
Wait a moment
I want to show you something
She ran away and disappeared behind the lowgrowing apple trees
What a charming creature Carl mur mured
I dont wonder that her husband is jealous
But cant she walk
does she always run
Alexandra nodded
Always
I dont see many people but I dont believe there are many like her anywhere
Marie came back with a branch she had broken from an apricot tree laden with pale yellow pinkcheeked fruit
She dropped it be side Carl
Did you plant those too
They are such beautiful little trees
Carl fingered the bluegreen leaves porous like blottingpaper and shaped like birch leaves hung on waxen red stems
Yes I think I did
Are these the circus trees Alex andra
Shall I tell her about them
Alexandra asked
Sit down like a good girl Marie and dont ruin my poor hat and Ill tell you a story
A long time ago when Carl and I were say sixteen and twelve a circus came to Hanover and we went to town in our wagon with Lou and Oscar to see the parade
We hadnt money enough to go to the circus
We followed the parade out to the circus grounds and hung around until the show began and the crowd went inside the tent
Then Lou was afraid we looked foolish standing outside in the pasture so we went back to Hanover feeling very sad
There was a man in the streets selling apricots and we had never seen any before
He had driven down from somewhere up in the French country and he was selling them twentyfive cents a peck
We had a little money our fathers had given us for candy and I bought two pecks and Carl bought one
They cheered us a good deal and we saved all the seeds and planted them
Up to the time Carl went away they hadnt borne at all
And now hes come back to eat them cried Marie nodding at Carl
That IS a good story
I can remember you a little Mr Lin strum
I used to see you in Hanover some times when Uncle Joe took me to town
I re member you because you were always buying pencils and tubes of paint at the drug store
Once when my uncle left me at the store you drew a lot of little birds and flowers for me on a piece of wrappingpaper
I kept them for a long while
I thought you were very romantic be cause you could draw and had such black eyes
Carl smiled
Yes I remember that time
Your uncle bought you some kind of a mechani cal toy a Turkish lady sitting on an ottoman and smoking a hookah wasnt it
And she turned her head backwards and forwards
Oh yes
Wasnt she splendid
I knew well enough I ought not to tell Uncle Joe I wanted it for he had just come back from the saloon and was feeling good
You remember how he laughed
She tickled him too
But when we got home my aunt scolded him for buying toys when she needed so many things
We wound our lady up every night and when she began to move her head my aunt used to laugh as hard as any of us
It was a musicbox you know and the Turkish lady played a tune while she smoked
That was how she made you feel so jolly
As I remember her she was lovely and had a gold crescent on her turban
Half an hour later as they were leaving the house Carl and Alexandra were met in the path by a strapping fellow in overalls and a blue shirt
He was breathing hard as if he had been running and was muttering to himself
Marie ran forward and taking him by the arm gave him a little push toward her guests
Frank this is Mr
Linstrum
Frank took off his broad straw hat and nod ded to Alexandra
When he spoke to Carl he showed a fine set of white teeth
He was burned a dull red down to his neckband and there was a heavy threedays stubble on his face
Even in his agitation he was handsome but he looked a rash and violent man
Barely saluting the callers he turned at once to his wife and began in an outraged tone I have to leave my team to drive the old woman Hillers hogs outa my wheat
I go to take dat old woman to de court if she aint careful I tell you
His wife spoke soothingly
But Frank she has only her lame boy to help her
She does the best she can
Alexandra looked at the excited man and offered a suggestion
Why dont you go over there some afternoon and hogtight her fences
Youd save time for yourself in the end
Franks neck stiffened
Notamuch I wont
I keep my hogs home
Other peoples can do like me
See
If that Louis can mend shoes he can mend fence
Maybe said Alexandra placidly but Ive found it sometimes pays to mend other peoples fences
Goodbye Marie
Come to see me soon
Alexandra walked firmly down the path and Carl followed her
Frank went into the house and threw himself on the sofa his face to the wall his clenched fist on his hip
Marie having seen her guests off came in and put her hand coaxingly on his shoulder
Poor Frank
Youve run until youve made your head ache now havent you
Let me make you some coffee
What else am I to do
he cried hotly in Bohemian
Am I to let any old womans hogs root up my wheat
Is that what I work myself to death for
Dont worry about it Frank
Ill speak to Mrs Hiller again
But really she almost cried last time they got out she was so sorry
Frank bounced over on his other side
Thats it you always side with them against me
They all know it
Anybody here feels free to borrow the mower and break it or turn their hogs in on me
They know you wont care
Marie hurried away to make his coffee
When she came back he was fast asleep
She sat down and looked at him for a long while very thoughtfully
When the kitchen clock struck six she went out to get supper closing the door gently behind her
She was always sorry for Frank when he worked himself into one of these rages and she was sorry to have him rough and quarrelsome with his neighbors
She was perfectly aware that the neighbors had a good deal to put up with and that they bore with Frank for her sake
VII Maries father Albert Tovesky was one of the more intelligent Bohemians who came West in the early seventies
He settled in Omaha and became a leader and adviser among his people there
Marie was his youngest child by a second wife and was the apple of his eye
She was barely sixteen and was in the graduating class of the Omaha High School when Frank Shabata arrived from the old coun try and set all the Bohemian girls in a flutter
He was easily the buck of the beergardens and on Sunday he was a sight to see with his silk hat and tucked shirt and blue frockcoat wearing gloves and carrying a little wisp of a yellow cane
He was tall and fair with splendid teeth and closecropped yellow curls and he wore a slightly disdainful expression proper for a young man with high connections whose mother had a big farm in the Elbe valley
There was often an interesting discontent in his blue eyes and every Bohemian girl he met imagined herself the cause of that unsatisfied expression
He had a way of drawing out his cambric hand kerchief slowly by one corner from his breast pocket that was melancholy and romantic in the extreme
He took a little flight with each of the more eligible Bohemian girls but it was when he was with little Marie Tovesky that he drew his handkerchief out most slowly and after he had lit a fresh cigar dropped the match most despairingly
Any one could see with half an eye that his proud heart was bleeding for somebody
One Sunday late in the summer after Maries graduation she met Frank at a Bohemian pic nic down the river and went rowing with him all the afternoon
When she got home that even ing she went straight to her fathers room and told him that she was engaged to Shabata
Old Tovesky was having a comfortable pipe before he went to bed
When he heard his daughters announcement he first prudently corked his beer bottle and then leaped to his feet and had a turn of temper
He characterized Frank Shabata by a Bohemian expression which is the equivalent of stuffed shirt
Why dont he go to work like the rest of us did
His farm in the Elbe valley indeed
Aint he got plenty brothers and sisters
Its his mothers farm and why dont he stay at home and help her
Havent I seen his mother out in the morning at five oclock with her ladle and her big bucket on wheels putting liquid manure on the cabbages
Dont I know the look of old Eva Shabatas hands
Like an old horses hoofs they areand this fellow wearing gloves and rings
Engaged indeed
You arent fit to be out of school and thats whats the matter with you
I will send you off to the Sisters of the Sacred Heart in St Louis and they will teach you some sense I guess
Accordingly the very next week Albert Tovesky took his daughter pale and tearful down the river to the convent
But the way to make Frank want anything was to tell him he couldnt have it
He managed to have an in terview with Marie before she went away and whereas he had been only half in love with her before he now persuaded himself that he would not stop at anything
Marie took with her to the convent under the canvas lining of her trunk the results of a laborious and satisfying morning on Franks part no less than a dozen photographs of himself taken in a dozen differ ent lovelorn attitudes
There was a little round photograph for her watchcase photographs for her wall and dresser and even long nar row ones to be used as bookmarks
More than once the handsome gentleman was torn to pieces before the French class by an indignant nun
Marie pined in the convent for a year until her eighteenth birthday was passed
Then she met Frank Shabata in the Union Station in St Louis and ran away with him
Old Tovesky forgave his daughter because there was nothing else to do and bought her a farm in the country that she had loved so well as a child
Since then her story had been a part of the history of the Divide
She and Frank had been living there for five years when Carl Linstrum came back to pay his long deferred visit to Alexandra
Frank had on the whole done better than one might have expected
He had flung himself at the soil with savage energy
Once a year he went to Hastings or to Omaha on a spree
He stayed away for a week or two and then came home and worked like a demon
He did work if he felt sorry for himself that was his own affair
VIII On the evening of the day of Alexandras call at the Shabatas a heavy rain set in
Frank sat up until a late hour reading the Sunday newspa pers
One of the Goulds was getting a divorce and Frank took it as a personal affront
In printing the story of the young mans mar ital troubles the knowing editor gave a suffi ciently colored account of his career stating the amount of his income and the manner in which he was supposed to spend it
Frank read English slowly and the more he read about this divorce case the angrier he grew
At last he threw down the page with a snort
He turned to his farmhand who was reading the other half of the paper
By God
if I have that young feller in de hayfield once I show him someting
Listen here what he do wit his money
And Frank began the catalogue of the young mans reputed extravagances
Marie sighed
She thought it hard that the Goulds for whom she had nothing but good will should make her so much trouble
She hated to see the Sunday newspapers come into the house
Frank was always reading about the doings of rich people and feeling outraged
He had an inexhaustible stock of stories about their crimes and follies how they bribed the courts and shot down their butlers with impunity whenever they chose
Frank and Lou Bergson had very similar ideas and they were two of the political agitators of the county
The next morning broke clear and brilliant but Frank said the ground was too wet to plough so he took the cart and drove over to SainteAgnes to spend the day at Moses Mar cels saloon
After he was gone Marie went out to the back porch to begin her buttermaking
A brisk wind had come up and was driving puffy white clouds across the sky
The orchard was sparkling and rippling in the sun
Marie stood looking toward it wistfully her hand on the lid of the churn when she heard a sharp ring in the air the merry sound of the whetstone on the scythe
That invitation decided her
She ran into the house put on a short skirt and a pair of her husbands boots caught up a tin pail and started for the orchard
Emil had already be gun work and was mowing vigorously
When he saw her coming he stopped and wiped his brow
His yellow canvas leggings and khaki trousers were splashed to the knees
Dont let me disturb you Emil
Im going to pick cherries
Isnt everything beautiful after the rain
Oh but Im glad to get this place mowed
When I heard it raining in the night I thought maybe you would come and do it for me today
The wind wakened me
Didnt it blow dreadfully
Just smell the wild roses
They are always so spicy after a rain
We never had so many of them in here before
I suppose its the wet season
Will you have to cut them too
If I cut the grass I will Emil said teas ingly
Whats the matter with you
What makes you so flighty
Am I flighty
I suppose thats the wet sea son too then
Its exciting to see everything growing so fastand to get the grass cut
Please leave the roses till last if you must cut them
Oh I dont mean all of them I mean that low place down by my tree where there are so many
Arent you splashed
Look at the spiderwebs all over the grass
Goodbye
Ill call you if I see a snake
She tripped away and Emil stood looking after her
In a few moments he heard the cher ries dropping smartly into the pail and he began to swing his scythe with that long even stroke that few American boys ever learn
Marie picked cherries and sang softly to herself stripping one glittering branch after another shivering when she caught a shower of rain drops on her neck and hair
And Emil mowed his way slowly down toward the cherry trees
That summer the rains had been so many and opportune that it was almost more than Shabata and his man could do to keep up with the corn the orchard was a neglected wilder ness
All sorts of weeds and herbs and flowers had grown up there splotches of wild larkspur pale greenandwhite spikes of hoarhound plantations of wild cotton tangles of foxtail and wild wheat
South of the apricot trees cor nering on the wheatfield was Franks alfalfa where myriads of white and yellow butterflies were always fluttering above the purple blos soms
When Emil reached the lower corner by the hedge Marie was sitting under her white mulberry tree the pailful of cherries beside her looking off at the gentle tireless swelling of the wheat
Emil she said suddenlyhe was mowing quietly about under the tree so as not to disturb herwhat religion did the Swedes have away back before they were Christians
Emil paused and straightened his back
I dont know
About like the Germans wasnt it
Marie went on as if she had not heard him
The Bohemians you know were tree wor shipers before the missionaries came
Father says the people in the mountains still do queer things sometimesthey believe that trees bring good or bad luck
Emil looked superior
Do they
Well which are the lucky trees
Id like to know
I dont know all of them but I know lindens are
The old people in the mountains plant lindens to purify the forest and to do away with the spells that come from the old trees they say have lasted from heathen times
Im a good Catholic but I think I could get along with caring for trees if I hadnt anything else
Thats a poor saying said Emil stooping over to wipe his hands in the wet grass
Why is it
If I feel that way I feel that way
I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do
I feel as if this tree knows everything I ever think of when I sit here
When I come back to it I never have to re mind it of anything I begin just where I left off
Emil had nothing to say to this
He reached up among the branches and began to pick the sweet insipid fruitlong ivorycolored ber ries tipped with faint pink like white coral that fall to the ground unheeded all summer through
He dropped a handful into her lap
Do you like Mr
Linstrum
Marie asked suddenly
Yes
Dont you
Oh ever so much only he seems kind of staid and schoolteachery
But of course he is older than Frank even
Im sure I dont want to live to be more than thirty do you
Do you think Alexandra likes him very much
I suppose so
They were old friends
Oh Emil you know what I mean
Marie tossed her head impatiently
Does she really care about him
When she used to tell me about him I always wondered whether she wasnt a little in love with him
Who Alexandra
Emil laughed and thrust his hands into his trousers pockets
Alexandras never been in love you crazy
He laughed again
She wouldnt know how to go about it
The idea
Marie shrugged her shoulders
Oh you dont know Alexandra as well as you think you do
If you had any eyes you would see that she is very fond of him
It would serve you all right if she walked off with Carl
I like him because he appreciates her more than you do
Emil frowned
What are you talking about Marie
Alexandras all right
She and I have always been good friends
What more do you want
I like to talk to Carl about New York and what a fellow can do there
Oh Emil
Surely you are not thinking of going off there
Why not
I must go somewhere mustnt I
The young man took up his scythe and leaned on it
Would you rather I went off in the sand hills and lived like Ivar
Maries face fell under his brooding gaze
She looked down at his wet leggings
Im sure Alexandra hopes you will stay on here she murmured
Then Alexandra will be disappointed the young man said roughly
What do I want to hang around here for
Alexandra can run the farm all right without me
I dont want to stand around and look on
I want to be doing something on my own account
Thats so Marie sighed
There are so many many things you can do
Almost any thing you choose
And there are so many many things I cant do
Emil echoed her tone sarcastically
Some times I dont want to do anything at all and sometimes I want to pull the four corners of the Divide togetherhe threw out his arm and brought it back with a jerkso like a tablecloth
I get tired of seeing men and horses going up and down up and down
Marie looked up at his defiant figure and her face clouded
I wish you werent so restless and didnt get so worked up over things she said sadly
Thank you he returned shortly
She sighed despondently
Everything I say makes you cross dont it
And you never used to be cross to me
Emil took a step nearer and stood frowning down at her bent head
He stood in an attitude of selfdefense his feet well apart his hands clenched and drawn up at his sides so that the cords stood out on his bare arms
I cant play with you like a little boy any more he said slowly
Thats what you miss Marie
Youll have to get some other little boy to play with
He stopped and took a deep breath
Then he went on in a low tone so intense that it was almost threatening Sometimes you seem to understand perfectly and then sometimes you pretend you dont
You dont help things any by pretending
Its then that I want to pull the corners of the Divide together
If you WONT understand you know I could make you
Marie clasped her hands and started up from her seat
She had grown very pale and her eyes were shining with excitement and distress
But Emil if I understand then all our good times are over we can never do nice things to gether any more
We shall have to behave like Mr Linstrum
And anyhow theres nothing to understand
She struck the ground with her little foot fiercely
That wont last
It will go away and things will be just as they used to
I wish you were a Catholic
The Church helps people indeed it does
I pray for you but thats not the same as if you prayed yourself
She spoke rapidly and pleadingly looked entreatingly into his face
Emil stood defiant gazing down at her
I cant pray to have the things I want he said slowly and I wont pray not to have them not if Im damned for it
Marie turned away wringing her hands
Oh Emil you wont try
Then all our good times are over
Yes over
I never expect to have any more
Emil gripped the handholds of his scythe and began to mow
Marie took up her cherries and went slowly toward the house crying bitterly
IX On Sunday afternoon a month after Carl Linstrums arrival he rode with Emil up into the French country to attend a Catholic fair
He sat for most of the afternoon in the base ment of the church where the fair was held talking to Marie Shabata or strolled about the gravel terrace thrown up on the hillside in front of the basement doors where the French boys were jumping and wrestling and throwing the discus
Some of the boys were in their white baseball suits they had just come up from a Sunday practice game down in the ball grounds
Amedee the newly married Emils best friend was their pitcher renowned among the country towns for his dash and skill
Amedee was a little fellow a year younger than Emil and much more boyish in appearance very lithe and active and neatly made with a clear brown and white skin and flashing white teeth
The SainteAgnes boys were to play the Hastings nine in a fortnight and Amedees lightning balls were the hope of his team
The little Frenchman seemed to get every ounce there was in him behind the ball as it left his hand
Youd have made the battery at the Univer sity for sure Medee Emil said as they were walking from the ballgrounds back to the church on the hill
Youre pitching better than you did in the spring
Amedee grinned
Sure
A married man dont lose his head no more
He slapped Emil on the back as he caught step with him
Oh Emil you wanna get married right off quick
Its the greatest thing ever
Emil laughed
How am I going to get mar ried without any girl
Amedee took his arm
Pooh
There are plenty girls will have you
You wanna get some nice French girl now
She treat you well always be jolly
Seehe began checking off on his fingersthere is Severine and Alphosen and Josephine and Hectorine and Louise and Malvinawhy I could love any of them girls
Why dont you get after them
Are you stuck up Emil or is anything the matter with you
I never did know a boy twentytwo years old before that didnt have no girl
You wanna be a priest maybe
Nota for me
Amedee swaggered
I bring many good Catholics into this world I hope and thats a way I help the Church
Emil looked down and patted him on the shoulder
Now youre windy Medee
You Frenchies like to brag
But Amedee had the zeal of the newly mar ried and he was not to be lightly shaken off
Honest and true Emil dont you want ANY girl
Maybe theres some young lady in Lin coln now very grandAmedee waved his hand languidly before his face to denote the fan of heartless beautyand you lost your heart up there
Is that it
Maybe said Emil
But Amedee saw no appropriate glow in his friends face
Bah
he exclaimed in disgust
I tell all the French girls to keep way from you
You gotta rock in there thumping Emil on the ribs
When they reached the terrace at the side of the church Amedee who was excited by his success on the ballgrounds challenged Emil to a jumpingmatch though he knew he would be beaten
They belted themselves up and Raoul Marcel the choir tenor and Father Duchesnes pet and Jean Bordelau held the string over which they vaulted
All the French boys stood round cheering and hump ing themselves up when Emil or Amedee went over the wire as if they were helping in the lift
Emil stopped at fivefeetfive declaring that he would spoil his appetite for supper if he jumped any more
Angelique Amedees pretty bride as blonde and fair as her name who had come out to watch the match tossed her head at Emil and said Medee could jump much higher than you if he were as tall
And anyhow he is much more graceful
He goes over like a bird and you have to hump yourself all up
Oh I do do I
Emil caught her and kissed her saucy mouth squarely while she laughed and struggled and called Medee
Medee
There you see your Medee isnt even big enough to get you away from me
I could run away with you right now and he could only sit down and cry about it
Ill show you whether I have to hump myself
Laughing and pant ing he picked Angelique up in his arms and began running about the rectangle with her
Not until he saw Marie Shabatas tiger eyes flashing from the gloom of the basement door way did he hand the disheveled bride over to her husband
There go to your graceful I havent the heart to take you away from him
Angelique clung to her husband and made faces at Emil over the white shoulder of Amedees ballshirt
Emil was greatly amused at her air of proprietorship and at Amedees shameless submission to it
He was delighted with his friends good fortune
He liked to see and to think about Amedees sunny natural happy love
He and Amedee had ridden and wrestled and larked together since they were lads of twelve
On Sundays and holidays they were always arm in arm
It seemed strange that now he should have to hide the thing that Amedee was so proud of that the feeling which gave one of them such happiness should bring the other such despair
It was like that when Alexandra tested her seedcorn in the spring he mused
From two ears that had grown side by side the grains of one shot up joyfully into the light projecting themselves into the future and the grains from the other lay still in the earth and rotted and nobody knew why
X While Emil and Carl were amusing them selves at the fair Alexandra was at home busy with her accountbooks which had been ne glected of late
She was almost through with her figures when she heard a cart drive up to the gate and looking out of the window she saw her two older brothers
They had seemed to avoid her ever since Carl Linstrums arrival four weeks ago that day and she hurried to the door to welcome them
She saw at once that they had come with some very definite purpose
They followed her stiffly into the sittingroom
Oscar sat down but Lou walked over to the window and remained standing his hands be hind him
You are by yourself
he asked looking toward the doorway into the parlor
Yes
Carl and Emil went up to the Catho lic fair
For a few moments neither of the men spoke
Then Lou came out sharply
How soon does he intend to go away from here
I dont know Lou
Not for some time I hope
Alexandra spoke in an even quiet tone that often exasperated her brothers
They felt that she was trying to be superior with them
Oscar spoke up grimly
We thought we ought to tell you that people have begun to talk he said meaningly
Alexandra looked at him
What about
Oscar met her eyes blankly
About you keeping him here so long
It looks bad for him to be hanging on to a woman this way
People think youre getting taken in
Alexandra shut her accountbook firmly
Boys she said seriously dont lets go on with this
We wont come out anywhere
I cant take advice on such a matter
I know you mean well but you must not feel responsible for me in things of this sort
If we go on with this talk it will only make hard feeling
Lou whipped about from the window
You ought to think a little about your family
Youre making us all ridiculous
How am I
People are beginning to say you want to marry the fellow
Well and what is ridiculous about that
Lou and Oscar exchanged outraged looks
Alexandra
Cant you see hes just a tramp and hes after your money
He wants to be taken care of he does
Well suppose I want to take care of him
Whose business is it but my own
Dont you know hed get hold of your property
Hed get hold of what I wished to give him certainly
Oscar sat up suddenly and Lou clutched at his bristly hair
Give him
Lou shouted
Our property our homestead
I dont know about the homestead said Alexandra quietly
I know you and Oscar have always expected that it would be left to your children and Im not sure but what youre right
But Ill do exactly as I please with the rest of my land boys
The rest of your land
cried Lou growing more excited every minute
Didnt all the land come out of the homestead
It was bought with money borrowed on the homestead and Oscar and me worked ourselves to the bone paying interest on it
Yes you paid the interest
But when you married we made a division of the land and you were satisfied
Ive made more on my farms since Ive been alone than when we all worked together
Everything youve made has come out of the original land that us boys worked for hasnt it
The farms and all that comes out of them belongs to us as a family
Alexandra waved her hand impatiently
Come now Lou
Stick to the facts
You are talking nonsense
Go to the county clerk and ask him who owns my land and whether my titles are good
Lou turned to his brother
This is what comes of letting a woman meddle in business he said bitterly
We ought to have taken things in our own hands years ago
But she liked to run things and we humored her
We thought you had good sense Alexandra
We never thought youd do anything foolish
Alexandra rapped impatiently on her desk with her knuckles
Listen Lou
Dont talk wild
You say you ought to have taken things into your own hands years ago
I suppose you mean before you left home
But how could you take hold of what wasnt there
Ive got most of what I have now since we divided the prop erty Ive built it up myself and it has nothing to do with you
Oscar spoke up solemnly
The property of a family really belongs to the men of the family no matter about the title
If anything goes wrong its the men that are held responsible
Yes of course Lou broke in
Everybody knows that
Oscar and me have always been easygoing and weve never made any fuss
We were willing you should hold the land and have the good of it but you got no right to part with any of it
We worked in the fields to pay for the first land you bought and what evers come out of it has got to be kept in the family
Oscar reinforced his brother his mind fixed on the one point he could see
The property of a family belongs to the men of the family because they are held responsible and because they do the work
Alexandra looked from one to the other her eyes full of indignation
She had been impa tient before but now she was beginning to feel angry
And what about my work
she asked in an unsteady voice
Lou looked at the carpet
Oh now Alex andra you always took it pretty easy
Of course we wanted you to
You liked to manage round and we always humored you
We realize you were a great deal of help to us
Theres no woman anywhere around that knows as much about business as you do and weve always been proud of that and thought you were pretty smart
But of course the real work always fell on us
Good advice is all right but it dont get the weeds out of the corn
Maybe not but it sometimes puts in the crop and it sometimes keeps the fields for corn to grow in said Alexandra dryly
Why Lou I can remember when you and Oscar wanted to sell this homestead and all the im provements to old preacher Ericson for two thousand dollars
If Id consented youd have gone down to the river and scraped along on poor farms for the rest of your lives
When I put in our first field of alfalfa you both opposed me just because I first heard about it from a young man who had been to the University
You said I was being taken in then and all the neighbors said so
You know as well as I do that alfalfa has been the salvation of this coun try
You all laughed at me when I said our land here was about ready for wheat and I had to raise three big wheat crops before the neigh bors quit putting all their land in corn
Why I remember you cried Lou when we put in the first big wheatplanting and said everybody was laughing at us
Lou turned to Oscar
Thats the woman of it if she tells you to put in a crop she thinks shes put it in
It makes women conceited to meddle in business
I shouldnt think youd want to remind us how hard you were on us Alexandra after the way you baby Emil
Hard on you
I never meant to be hard
Conditions were hard
Maybe I would never have been very soft anyhow but I certainly didnt choose to be the kind of girl I was
If you take even a vine and cut it back again and again it grows hard like a tree
Lou felt that they were wandering from the point and that in digression Alexandra might unnerve him
He wiped his forehead with a jerk of his handkerchief
We never doubted you Alexandra
We never questioned any thing you did
Youve always had your own way
But you cant expect us to sit like stumps and see you done out of the property by any loafer who happens along and making yourself ridiculous into the bargain
Oscar rose
Yes he broke in every bodys laughing to see you get took in at your age too
Everybody knows hes nearly five years younger than you and is after your money
Why Alexandra you are forty years old
All that doesnt concern anybody but Carl and me
Go to town and ask your lawyers what you can do to restrain me from disposing of my own property
And I advise you to do what they tell you for the authority you can exert by law is the only influence you will ever have over me again
Alexandra rose
I think I would rather not have lived to find out what I have today she said quietly closing her desk
Lou and Oscar looked at each other ques tioningly
There seemed to be nothing to do but to go and they walked out
You cant do business with women Oscar said heavily as he clambered into the cart
But anyhow weve had our say at last
Lou scratched his head
Talk of that kind might come too high you know but shes apt to be sensible
You hadnt ought to said that about her age though Oscar
Im afraid that hurt her feelings and the worst thing we can do is to make her sore at us
Shed marry him out of contrariness
I only meant said Oscar that she is old enough to know better and she is
If she was going to marry she ought to done it long ago and not go making a fool of herself now
Lou looked anxious nevertheless
Of course he reflected hopefully and incon sistently Alexandra aint much like other womenfolks
Maybe it wont make her sore
Maybe shed as soon be forty as not
XI Emil came home at about halfpast seven oclock that evening
Old Ivar met him at the windmill and took his horse and the young man went directly into the house
He called to his sister and she answered from her bedroom behind the sittingroom saying that she was lying down
Emil went to her door
Can I see you for a minute
he asked
I want to talk to you about something before Carl comes
Alexandra rose quickly and came to the door
Where is Carl
Lou and Oscar met us and said they wanted to talk to him so he rode over to Oscars with them
Are you coming out
Emil asked impatiently
Yes sit down
Ill be dressed in a mo ment
Alexandra closed her door and Emil sank down on the old slat lounge and sat with his head in his hands
When his sister came out he looked up not knowing whether the interval had been short or long and he was surprised to see that the room had grown quite dark
That was just as well it would be easier to talk if he were not under the gaze of those clear deliber ate eyes that saw so far in some directions and were so blind in others
Alexandra too was glad of the dusk
Her face was swollen from crying
Emil started up and then sat down again
Alexandra he said slowly in his deep young baritone I dont want to go away to law school this fall
Let me put it off another year
I want to take a year off and look around
Its awfully easy to rush into a profession you dont really like and awfully hard to get out of it
Linstrum and I have been talking about that
Very well Emil
Only dont go off looking for land
She came up and put her hand on his shoulder
Ive been wishing you could stay with me this winter
Thats just what I dont want to do Alex andra
Im restless
I want to go to a new place
I want to go down to the City of Mexico to join one of the University fellows whos at the head of an electrical plant
He wrote me he could give me a little job enough to pay my way and I could look around and see what I want to do
I want to go as soon as harvest is over
I guess Lou and Oscar will be sore about it
I suppose they will
Alexandra sat down on the lounge beside him
They are very angry with me Emil
We have had a quarrel
They will not come here again
Emil scarcely heard what she was saying he did not notice the sadness of her tone
He was thinking about the reckless life he meant to live in Mexico
What about
he asked absently
About Carl Linstrum
They are afraid I am going to marry him and that some of my property will get away from them
Emil shrugged his shoulders
What non sense
he murmured
Just like them
Alexandra drew back
Why nonsense Emil
Why youve never thought of such a thing have you
They always have to have something to fuss about
Emil said his sister slowly you ought not to take things for granted
Do you agree with them that I have no right to change my way of living
Emil looked at the outline of his sisters head in the dim light
They were sitting close to gether and he somehow felt that she could hear his thoughts
He was silent for a mo ment and then said in an embarrassed tone Why no certainly not
You ought to do whatever you want to
Ill always back you
But it would seem a little bit ridiculous to you if I married Carl
Emil fidgeted
The issue seemed to him too farfetched to warrant discussion
Why no
I should be surprised if you wanted to
I cant see exactly why
But thats none of my busi ness
You ought to do as you please
Certainly you ought not to pay any attention to what the boys say
Alexandra sighed
I had hoped you might understand a little why I do want to
But I suppose thats too much to expect
Ive had a pretty lonely life Emil
Besides Marie Carl is the only friend I have ever had
Emil was awake now a name in her last sen tence roused him
He put out his hand and took his sisters awkwardly
You ought to do just as you wish and I think Carls a fine fel low
He and I would always get on
I dont believe any of the things the boys say about him honest I dont
They are suspicious of him because hes intelligent
You know their way
Theyve been sore at me ever since you let me go away to college
Theyre always trying to catch me up
If I were you I wouldnt pay any attention to them
Theres nothing to get upset about
Carls a sensible fellow
He wont mind them
I dont know
If they talk to him the way they did to me I think hell go away
Emil grew more and more uneasy
Think so
Well Marie said it would serve us all right if you walked off with him
Did she
Bless her little heart
SHE would
Alexandras voice broke
Emil began unlacing his leggings
Why dont you talk to her about it
Theres Carl I hear his horse
I guess Ill go upstairs and get my boots off
No I dont want any supper
We had supper at five oclock at the fair
Emil was glad to escape and get to his own room
He was a little ashamed for his sister though he had tried not to show it
He felt that there was something indecorous in her proposal and she did seem to him somewhat ridiculous
There was trouble enough in the world he reflected as he threw himself upon his bed without people who were forty years old imagining they wanted to get married
In the darkness and silence Emil was not likely to think long about Alexandra
Every image slipped away but one
He had seen Marie in the crowd that afternoon
She sold candy at the fair
WHY had she ever run away with Frank Shabata and how could she go on laughing and working and taking an interest in things
Why did she like so many people and why had she seemed pleased when all the French and Bohe mian boys and the priest himself crowded round her candy stand
Why did she care about any one but him
Why could he never never find the thing he looked for in her playful affectionate eyes
Then he fell to imagining that he looked once more and found it there and what it would be like if she loved himshe who as Alexandra said could give her whole heart
In that dream he could lie for hours as if in a trance
His spirit went out of his body and crossed the fields to Marie Shabata
At the University dances the girls had often looked wonderingly at the tall young Swede with the fine head leaning against the wall and frowning his arms folded his eyes fixed on the ceiling or the floor
All the girls were a little afraid of him
He was distinguishedlooking and not the jollying kind
They felt that he was too intense and preoccupied
There was some thing queer about him
Emils fraternity rather prided itself upon its dances and some times he did his duty and danced every dance
But whether he was on the floor or brooding in a corner he was always thinking about Marie Shabata
For two years the storm had been gathering in him
XII Carl came into the sittingroom while Alex andra was lighting the lamp
She looked up at him as she adjusted the shade
His sharp shoul ders stooped as if he were very tired his face was pale and there were bluish shadows under his dark eyes
His anger had burned itself out and left him sick and disgusted
You have seen Lou and Oscar
Alexandra asked
Yes
His eyes avoided hers
Alexandra took a deep breath
And now you are going away
I thought so
Carl threw himself into a chair and pushed the dark lock back from his forehead with his white nervous hand
What a hopeless posi tion you are in Alexandra
he exclaimed feverishly
It is your fate to be always sur rounded by little men
And I am no better than the rest
I am too little to face the criticism of even such men as Lou and Oscar
Yes I am going away tomorrow
I cannot even ask you to give me a promise until I have something to offer you
I thought perhaps I could do that but I find I cant
What good comes of offering people things they dont need
Alexandra asked sadly
I dont need money
But I have needed you for a great many years
I wonder why I have been permitted to prosper if it is only to take my friends away from me
I dont deceive myself Carl said frankly
I know that I am going away on my own account
I must make the usual effort
I must have something to show for myself
To take what you would give me I should have to be either a very large man or a very small one and I am only in the middle class
Alexandra sighed
I have a feeling that if you go away you will not come back
Some thing will happen to one of us or to both
People have to snatch at happiness when they can in this world
It is always easier to lose than to find
What I have is yours if you care enough about me to take it
Carl rose and looked up at the picture of John Bergson
But I cant my dear I cant
I will go North at once
Instead of idling about in California all winter I shall be getting my bearings up there
I wont waste another week
Be patient with me Alexandra
Give me a year
As you will said Alexandra wearily
All at once in a single day I lose everything and I do not know why
Emil too is going away
Carl was still studying John Bergsons face and Alexandras eyes followed his
Yes she said if he could have seen all that would come of the task he gave me he would have been sorry
I hope he does not see me now
I hope that he is among the old people of his blood and country and that tidings do not reach him from the New World
PART III Winter Memories I Winter has settled down over the Divide again the season in which Nature recuperates in which she sinks to sleep between the fruitful ness of autumn and the passion of spring
The birds have gone
The teeming life that goes on down in the long grass is exterminated
The prairiedog keeps his hole
The rabbits run shivering from one frozen garden patch to an other and are hard put to it to find frostbitten cabbagestalks
At night the coyotes roam the wintry waste howling for food
The variegated fields are all one color now the pastures the stubble the roads the sky are the same leaden gray
The hedgerows and trees are scarcely per ceptible against the bare earth whose slaty hue they have taken on
The ground is frozen so hard that it bruises the foot to walk in the roads or in the ploughed fields
It is like an iron country and the spirit is oppressed by its rigor and melancholy
One could easily believe that in that dead landscape the germs of life and fruit fulness were extinct forever
Alexandra has settled back into her old routine
There are weekly letters from Emil
Lou and Oscar she has not seen since Carl went away
To avoid awkward encounters in the presence of curious spectators she has stopped going to the Norwegian Church and drives up to the Reform Church at Hanover or goes with Marie Shabata to the Catholic Church locally known as the French Church
She has not told Marie about Carl or her dif ferences with her brothers
She was never very communicative about her own affairs and when she came to the point an instinct told her that about such things she and Marie would not understand one another
Old Mrs Lee had been afraid that family misunderstandings might deprive her of her yearly visit to Alexandra
But on the first day of December Alexandra telephoned Annie that tomorrow she would send Ivar over for her mother and the next day the old lady arrived with her bundles
For twelve years Mrs Lee had always entered Alexandras sittingroom with the same exclamation Now we be yusta like old times
She enjoyed the liberty Alex andra gave her and hearing her own language about her all day long
Here she could wear her nightcap and sleep with all her windows shut listen to Ivar reading the Bible and here she could run about among the stables in a pair of Emils old boots
Though she was bent almost double she was as spry as a gopher
Her face was as brown as if it had been varnished and as full of wrinkles as a washerwomans hands
She had three jolly old teeth left in the front of her mouth and when she grinned she looked very knowing as if when you found out how to take it life wasnt half bad
While she and Alex andra patched and pieced and quilted she talked incessantly about stories she read in a Swedish family paper telling the plots in great detail or about her life on a dairy farm in Gottland when she was a girl
Sometimes she forgot which were the printed stories and which were the real stories it all seemed so far away
She loved to take a little brandy with hot water and sugar before she went to bed and Alexandra always had it ready for her
It sends good dreams she would say with a twinkle in her eye
When Mrs Lee had been with Alexandra for a week Marie Shabata telephoned one morning to say that Frank had gone to town for the day and she would like them to come over for coffee in the afternoon
Mrs Lee hurried to wash out and iron her new crossstitched apron which she had finished only the night before a checked gingham apron worked with a design ten inches broad across the bottom a hunting scene with fir trees and a stag and dogs and huntsmen
Mrs Lee was firm with herself at dinner and refused a second helping of apple dumplings
I taank I save up she said with a giggle
At two oclock in the afternoon Alexandras cart drove up to the Shabatas gate and Marie saw Mrs Lees red shawl come bobbing up the path
She ran to the door and pulled the old woman into the house with a hug helping her to take off her wraps while Alexandra blan keted the horse outside
Mrs Lee had put on her best black satine dressshe abominated woolen stuffs even in winterand a crocheted collar fastened with a big pale gold pin con taining faded daguerreotypes of her father and mother
She had not worn her apron for fear of rumpling it and now she shook it out and tied it round her waist with a conscious air
Marie drew back and threw up her hands exclaiming Oh what a beauty
Ive never seen this one before have I Mrs
Lee
The old woman giggled and ducked her head
No yust las night I maake
See dis tread verra strong no waash out no fade
My sis ter send from Sveden
I yusta taank you like dis
Marie ran to the door again
Come in Alexandra
I have been looking at Mrs Lees apron
Do stop on your way home and show it to Mrs Hiller
Shes crazy about crossstitch
While Alexandra removed her hat and veil Mrs Lee went out to the kitchen and settled herself in a wooden rockingchair by the stove looking with great interest at the table set for three with a white cloth and a pot of pink geraniums in the middle
My aant you gotta fine plants sucha much flower
How you keep from freeze
She pointed to the windowshelves full of blooming fuchsias and geraniums
I keep the fire all night Mrs Lee and when its very cold I put them all on the table in the middle of the room
Other nights I only put newspapers behind them
Frank laughs at me for fussing but when they dont bloom he says Whats the matter with the darned things
 What do you hear from Carl Alexandra
He got to Dawson before the river froze and now I suppose I wont hear any more until spring
Before he left California he sent me a box of orange flowers but they didnt keep very well
I have brought a bunch of Emils letters for you
Alexandra came out from the sittingroom and pinched Maries cheek play fully
You dont look as if the weather ever froze you up
Never have colds do you
Thats a good girl
She had dark red cheeks like this when she was a little girl Mrs Lee
She looked like some queer foreign kind of a doll
Ive never forgot the first time I saw you in Mieklejohns store Marie the time father was lying sick
Carl and I were talking about that before he went away
I remember and Emil had his kitten along
When are you going to send Emils Christmas box
It ought to have gone before this
Ill have to send it by mail now to get it there in time
Marie pulled a dark purple silk necktie from her workbasket
I knit this for him
Its a good color dont you think
Will you please put it in with your things and tell him its from me to wear when he goes serenading
Alexandra laughed
I dont believe he goes serenading much
He says in one letter that the Mexican ladies are said to be very beauti ful but that dont seem to me very warm praise
Marie tossed her head
Emil cant fool me
If hes bought a guitar he goes serenading
Who wouldnt with all those Spanish girls dropping flowers down from their windows
Id sing to them every night wouldnt you Mrs
Lee
The old lady chuckled
Her eyes lit up as Marie bent down and opened the oven door
A delicious hot fragrance blew out into the tidy kitchen
My someting smell good
She turned to Alexandra with a wink her three yel low teeth making a brave show I taank dat stop my yaw from ache no more
she said con tentedly
Marie took out a pan of delicate little rolls stuffed with stewed apricots and began to dust them over with powdered sugar
I hope youll like these Mrs Lee Alexandra does
The Bohemians always like them with their coffee
But if you dont I have a coffeecake with nuts and poppy seeds
Alexandra will you get the cream jug
I put it in the window to keep cool
The Bohemians said Alexandra as they drew up to the table certainly know how to make more kinds of bread than any other peo ple in the world
Old Mrs Hiller told me once at the church supper that she could make seven kinds of fancy bread but Marie could make a dozen
Mrs Lee held up one of the apricot rolls between her brown thumb and forefinger and weighed it critically
Yust likea fedders she pronounced with satisfaction
My aant dis nice
she exclaimed as she stirred her coffee
I yust taake a liddle yelly now too I taank
Alexandra and Marie laughed at her fore handedness and fell to talking of their own affairs
I was afraid you had a cold when I talked to you over the telephone the other night Marie
What was the matter had you been crying
Maybe I had Marie smiled guiltily
Frank was out late that night
Dont you get lonely sometimes in the winter when every body has gone away
I thought it was something like that
If I hadnt had company Id have run over to see for myself
If you get downhearted what will become of the rest of us
Alexandra asked
I dont very often
Theres Mrs Lee without any coffee
Later when Mrs Lee declared that her powers were spent Marie and Alexandra went upstairs to look for some crochet patterns the old lady wanted to borrow
Better put on your coat Alexandra
Its cold up there and I have no idea where those patterns are
I may have to look through my old trunks
Marie caught up a shawl and opened the stair door run ning up the steps ahead of her guest
While I go through the bureau drawers you might look in those hatboxes on the closetshelf over where Franks clothes hang
There are a lot of odds and ends in them
She began tossing over the contents of the drawers and Alexandra went into the clothes closet
Presently she came back holding a slender elastic yellow stick in her hand
What in the world is this Marie
You dont mean to tell me Frank ever carried such a thing
Marie blinked at it with astonishment and sat down on the floor
Where did you find it
I didnt know he had kept it
I havent seen it for years
It really is a cane then
Yes
One he brought from the old coun try
He used to carry it when I first knew him
Isnt it foolish
Poor Frank
Alexandra twirled the stick in her fingers and laughed
He must have looked funny
Marie was thoughtful
No he didnt really
It didnt seem out of place
He used to be awfully gay like that when he was a young man
I guess people always get whats hard est for them Alexandra
Marie gathered the shawl closer about her and still looked hard at the cane
Frank would be all right in the right place she said reflectively
He ought to have a different kind of wife for one thing
Do you know Alexandra I could pick out exactly the right sort of woman for Franknow
The trouble is you almost have to marry a man before you can find out the sort of wife he needs and usually its exactly the sort you are not
Then what are you going to do about it
she asked candidly
Alexandra confessed she didnt know
However she added it seems to me that you get along with Frank about as well as any woman Ive ever seen or heard of could
Marie shook her head pursing her lips and blowing her warm breath softly out into the frosty air
No I was spoiled at home
I like my own way and I have a quick tongue
When Frank brags I say sharp things and he never forgets
He goes over and over it in his mind I can feel him
Then Im too giddy
Franks wife ought to be timid and she ought not to care about another living thing in the world but just Frank
I didnt when I married him but I suppose I was too young to stay like that
Marie sighed
Alexandra had never heard Marie speak so frankly about her husband before and she felt that it was wiser not to encourage her
No good she reasoned ever came from talking about such things and while Marie was think ing aloud Alexandra had been steadily search ing the hatboxes
Arent these the pat terns Maria
Maria sprang up from the floor
Sure enough we were looking for patterns werent we
Id forgot about everything but Franks other wife
Ill put that away
She poked the cane behind Franks Sunday clothes and though she laughed Alexandra saw there were tears in her eyes
When they went back to the kitchen the snow had begun to fall and Maries visitors thought they must be getting home
She went out to the cart with them and tucked the robes about old Mrs Lee while Alexandra took the blanket off her horse
As they drove away Marie turned and went slowly back to the house
She took up the package of letters Alexandra had brought but she did not read them
She turned them over and looked at the foreign stamps and then sat watching the fly ing snow while the dusk deepened in the kitchen and the stove sent out a red glow
Marie knew perfectly well that Emils letters were written more for her than for Alexandra
They were not the sort of letters that a young man writes to his sister
They were both more personal and more painstaking full of descrip tions of the gay life in the old Mexican capital in the days when the strong hand of Porfirio Diaz was still strong
He told about bullfights and cockfights churches and FIESTAS the flower markets and the fountains the music and dan cing the people of all nations he met in the Italian restaurants on San Francisco Street
In short they were the kind of letters a young man writes to a woman when he wishes himself and his life to seem interesting to her when he wishes to enlist her imagination in his behalf
Marie when she was alone or when she sat sewing in the evening often thought about what it must be like down there where Emil was where there were flowers and street bands everywhere and carriages rattling up and down and where there was a little blind boot black in front of the cathedral who could play any tune you asked for by dropping the lids of blackingboxes on the stone steps
When everything is done and over for one at twenty three it is pleasant to let the mind wander forth and follow a young adventurer who has life before him
And if it had not been for me she thought Frank might still be free like that and having a good time making peo ple admire him
Poor Frank getting married wasnt very good for him either
Im afraid I do set people against him as he says
I seem somehow to give him away all the time
Per haps he would try to be agreeable to people again if I were not around
It seems as if I always make him just as bad as he can be
Later in the winter Alexandra looked back upon that afternoon as the last satisfactory visit she had had with Marie
After that day the younger woman seemed to shrink more and more into herself
When she was with Alexan dra she was not spontaneous and frank as she used to be
She seemed to be brooding over something and holding something back
The weather had a good deal to do with their seeing less of each other than usual
There had not been such snowstorms in twenty years and the path across the fields was drifted deep from Christ mas until March
When the two neighbors went to see each other they had to go round by the wagonroad which was twice as far
They tele phoned each other almost every night though in January there was a stretch of three weeks when the wires were down and when the post man did not come at all
Marie often ran in to see her nearest neigh bor old Mrs Hiller who was crippled with rheumatism and had only her son the lame shoemaker to take care of her and she went to the French Church whatever the weather
She was a sincerely devout girl
She prayed for her self and for Frank and for Emil among the temptations of that gay corrupt old city
She found more comfort in the Church that winter than ever before
It seemed to come closer to her and to fill an emptiness that ached in her heart
She tried to be patient with her hus band
He and his hired man usually played Cal ifornia Jack in the evening
Marie sat sew ing or crocheting and tried to take a friendly interest in the game but she was always thinking about the wide fields outside where the snow was drifting over the fences and about the orchard where the snow was falling and packing crust over crust
When she went out into the dark kitchen to fix her plants for the night she used to stand by the window and look out at the white fields or watch the currents of snow whirling over the orchard
She seemed to feel the weight of all the snow that lay down there
The branches had be come so hard that they wounded your hand if you but tried to break a twig
And yet down under the frozen crusts at the roots of the trees the secret of life was still safe warm as the blood in ones heart and the spring would come again
Oh it would come again
II If Alexandra had had much imagination she might have guessed what was going on in Maries mind and she would have seen long before what was going on in Emils
But that as Emil himself had more than once reflected was Alexandras blind side and her life had not been of the kind to sharpen her vision
Her training had all been toward the end of making her proficient in what she had undertaken to do
Her personal life her own realization of herself was almost a subconscious existence like an underground river that came to the surface only here and there at intervals months apart and then sank again to flow on under her own fields
Nevertheless the underground stream was there and it was because she had so much per sonality to put into her enterprises and suc ceeded in putting it into them so completely that her affairs prospered better than those of her neighbors
There were certain days in her life out wardly uneventful which Alexandra remem bered as peculiarly happy days when she was close to the flat fallow world about her and felt as it were in her own body the joyous germination in the soil
There were days too which she and Emil had spent together upon which she loved to look back
There had been such a day when they were down on the river in the dry year looking over the land
They had made an early start one morning and had driven a long way before noon
When Emil said he was hungry they drew back from the road gave Brigham his oats among the bushes and climbed up to the top of a grassy bluff to eat their lunch under the shade of some little elm trees
The river was clear there and shallow since there had been no rain and it ran in ripples over the sparkling sand
Under the overhanging willows of the opposite bank there was an inlet where the water was deeper and flowed so slowly that it seemed to sleep in the sun
In this little bay a single wild duck was swimming and diving and preening her feathers disporting herself very happily in the flickering light and shade
They sat for a long time watching the solitary bird take its pleasure
No living thing had ever seemed to Alexandra as beautiful as that wild duck
Emil must have felt about it as she did for afterward when they were at home he used sometimes to say Sister you know our duck down there Alexandra remembered that day as one of the happiest in her life
Years afterward she thought of the duck as still there swimming and diving all by herself in the sun light a kind of enchanted bird that did not know age or change
Most of Alexandras happy memories were as impersonal as this one yet to her they were very personal
Her mind was a white book with clear writing about weather and beasts and growing things
Not many people would have cared to read it only a happy few
She had never been in love she had never indulged in sentimental reveries
Even as a girl she had looked upon men as workfellows
She had grown up in serious times
There was one fancy indeed which persisted through her girlhood
It most often came to her on Sunday mornings the one day in the week when she lay late abed listening to the familiar morning sounds the windmill singing in the brisk breeze Emil whistling as he blacked his boots down by the kitchen door
Some times as she lay thus luxuriously idle her eyes closed she used to have an illusion of being lifted up bodily and carried lightly by some one very strong
It was a man certainly who car ried her but he was like no man she knew he was much larger and stronger and swifter and he carried her as easily as if she were a sheaf of wheat
She never saw him but with eyes closed she could feel that he was yellow like the sunlight and there was the smell of ripe corn fields about him
She could feel him approach bend over her and lift her and then she could feel herself being carried swiftly off across the fields
After such a reverie she would rise has tily angry with herself and go down to the bathhouse that was partitioned off the kitchen shed
There she would stand in a tin tub and prosecute her bath with vigor finishing it by pouring buckets of cold wellwater over her gleaming white body which no man on the Divide could have carried very far
As she grew older this fancy more often came to her when she was tired than when she was fresh and strong
Sometimes after she had been in the open all day overseeing the brand ing of the cattle or the loading of the pigs she would come in chilled take a concoction of spices and warm homemade wine and go to bed with her body actually aching with fatigue
Then just before she went to sleep she had the old sensation of being lifted and carried by a strong being who took from her all her bodily weariness
PART IV The White Mulberry Tree I The French Church properly the Church of SainteAgnes stood upon a hill
The high nar row redbrick building with its tall steeple and steep roof could be seen for miles across the wheatfields though the little town of Sainte Agnes was completely hidden away at the foot of the hill
The church looked powerful and triumphant there on its eminence so high above the rest of the landscape with miles of warm color lying at its feet and by its position and setting it reminded one of some of the churches built long ago in the wheatlands of middle France
Late one June afternoon Alexandra Bergson was driving along one of the many roads that led through the rich French farming country to the big church
The sunlight was shining di rectly in her face and there was a blaze of light all about the red church on the hill
Beside Alexandra lounged a strikingly exotic figure in a tall Mexican hat a silk sash and a black vel vet jacket sewn with silver buttons
Emil had returned only the night before and his sister was so proud of him that she decided at once to take him up to the church supper and to make him wear the Mexican costume he had brought home in his trunk
All the girls who have stands are going to wear fancy costumes she argued and some of the boys
Marie is going to tell fortunes and she sent to Omaha for a Bohemian dress her father brought back from a visit to the old country
If you wear those clothes they will all be pleased
And you must take your guitar
Everybody ought to do what they can to help along and we have never done much
We are not a talented family
The supper was to be at six oclock in the basement of the church and afterward there would be a fair with charades and an auction
Alexandra had set out from home early leaving the house to Signa and Nelse Jensen who were to be married next week
Signa had shyly asked to have the wedding put off until Emil came home
Alexandra was well satisfied with her brother
As they drove through the rolling French coun try toward the westering sun and the stalwart church she was thinking of that time long ago when she and Emil drove back from the river valley to the still unconquered Divide
Yes she told herself it had been worth while both Emil and the country had become what she had hoped
Out of her fathers children there was one who was fit to cope with the world who had not been tied to the plow and who had a per sonality apart from the soil
And that she reflected was what she had worked for
She felt well satisfied with her life
When they reached the church a score of teams were hitched in front of the basement doors that opened from the hillside upon the sanded terrace where the boys wrestled and had jumpingmatches
Amedee Chevalier a proud father of one week rushed out and embraced Emil
Amedee was an only sonhence he was a very rich young manbut he meant to have twenty children himself like his uncle Xavier
Oh Emil he cried hugging his old friend rapturously why aint you been up to see my boy
You come tomorrow sure
Emil you wanna get a boy right off
Its the greatest thing ever
No no no
Angel not sick at all
Everything just fine
That boy he come into this world laughin and he been laughin ever since
You come an see
He pounded Emils ribs to emphasize each announcement
Emil caught his arms
Stop Amedee
Youre knocking the wind out of me
I brought him cups and spoons and blankets and mocca sins enough for an orphan asylum
Im awful glad its a boy sure enough
The young men crowded round Emil to ad mire his costume and to tell him in a breath everything that had happened since he went away
Emil had more friends up here in the French country than down on Norway Creek
The French and Bohemian boys were spirited and jolly liked variety and were as much pre disposed to favor anything new as the Scandi navian boys were to reject it
The Norwegian and Swedish lads were much more selfcentred apt to be egotistical and jealous
They were cautious and reserved with Emil because he had been away to college and were prepared to take him down if he should try to put on airs with them
The French boys liked a bit of swagger and they were always delighted to hear about anything new new clothes new games new songs new dances
Now they car ried Emil off to show him the club room they had just fitted up over the postoffice down in the village
They ran down the hill in a drove all laughing and chattering at once some in French some in English
Alexandra went into the cool whitewashed basement where the women were setting the tables
Marie was standing on a chair building a little tent of shawls where she was to tell fortunes
She sprang down and ran toward Alexandra stopping short and looking at her in disappointment
Alexandra nodded to her encouragingly
Oh he will be here Marie
The boys have taken him off to show him something
You wont know him
He is a man now sure enough
I have no boy left
He smokes terriblesmelling Mexican cigarettes and talks Spanish
How pretty you look child
Where did you get those beautiful earrings
They belonged to fathers mother
He always promised them to me
He sent them with the dress and said I could keep them
Marie wore a short red skirt of stoutly woven cloth a white bodice and kirtle a yellow silk turban wound low over her brown curls and long coral pendants in her ears
Her ears had been pierced against a piece of cork by her greataunt when she was seven years old
In those germless days she had worn bits of broom straw plucked from the common sweeping broom in the lobes until the holes were healed and ready for little gold rings
When Emil came back from the village he lingered outside on the terrace with the boys
Marie could hear him talking and strumming on his guitar while Raoul Marcel sang falsetto
She was vexed with him for staying out there
It made her very nervous to hear him and not to see him for certainly she told herself she was not going out to look for him
When the supper bell rang and the boys came trooping in to get seats at the first table she forgot all about her annoyance and ran to greet the tall est of the crowd in his conspicuous attire
She didnt mind showing her embarrassment at all
She blushed and laughed excitedly as she gave Emil her hand and looked delightedly at the black velvet coat that brought out his fair skin and fine blond head
Marie was incapable of being lukewarm about anything that pleased her
She simply did not know how to give a halfhearted response
When she was de lighted she was as likely as not to stand on her tiptoes and clap her hands
If people laughed at her she laughed with them
Do the men wear clothes like that every day in the street
She caught Emil by his sleeve and turned him about
Oh I wish I lived where people wore things like that
Are the buttons real silver
Put on the hat please
What a heavy thing
How do you ever wear it
Why dont you tell us about the bull fights
She wanted to wring all his experiences from him at once without waiting a moment
Emil smiled tolerantly and stood looking down at her with his old brooding gaze while the French girls fluttered about him in their white dresses and ribbons and Alexandra watched the scene with pride
Several of the French girls Marie knew were hoping that Emil would take them to supper and she was relieved when he took only his sister
Marie caught Franks arm and dragged him to the same table managing to get seats opposite the Bergsons so that she could hear what they were talking about
Alexandra made Emil tell Mrs Xavier Chevalier the mother of the twenty about how he had seen a famous matador killed in the bullring
Marie listened to every word only taking her eyes from Emil to watch Franks plate and keep it filled
When Emil finished his account bloody enough to satisfy Mrs Xavier and to make her feel thankful that she was not a matadorMarie broke out with a volley of questions
How did the women dress when they went to bullfights
Did they wear man tillas
Did they never wear hats
After supper the young people played char ades for the amusement of their elders who sat gossiping between their guesses
All the shops in SainteAgnes were closed at eight oclock that night so that the merchants and their clerks could attend the fair
The auction was the liveliest part of the entertainment for the French boys always lost their heads when they began to bid satisfied that their extravagance was in a good cause
After all the pincushions and sofa pillows and embroidered slippers were sold Emil precipitated a panic by taking out one of his turquoise shirt studs which every one had been admiring and handing it to the auc tioneer
All the French girls clamored for it and their sweethearts bid against each other recklessly
Marie wanted it too and she kept making signals to Frank which he took a sour pleasure in disregarding
He didnt see the use of making a fuss over a fellow just because he was dressed like a clown
When the turquoise went to Malvina Sauvage the French bankers daughter Marie shrugged her shoulders and betook herself to her little tent of shawls where she began to shuffle her cards by the light of a tallow candle calling out Fortunes for tunes
The young priest Father Duchesne went first to have his fortune read
Marie took his long white hand looked at it and then began to run off her cards
I see a long journey across water for you Father
You will go to a town all cut up by water built on islands it seems to be with rivers and green fields all about
And you will visit an old lady with a white cap and gold hoops in her ears and you will be very happy there
Mais oui said the priest with a melan choly smile
Cest LIsleAdam chez ma mere
Vous etes tres savante ma fille
He patted her yellow turban calling Venez donc mes garcons
Il y a ici une veritable clairvoyante
Marie was clever at fortunetelling indulg ing in a light irony that amused the crowd
She told old Brunot the miser that he would lose all his money marry a girl of sixteen and live happily on a crust
Sholte the fat Russian boy who lived for his stomach was to be disap pointed in love grow thin and shoot himself from despondency
Amedee was to have twenty children and nineteen of them were to be girls
Amedee slapped Frank on the back and asked him why he didnt see what the fortuneteller would promise him
But Frank shook off his friendly hand and grunted She tell my fortune long ago bad enough
Then he withdrew to a corner and sat glowering at his wife
Franks case was all the more painful because he had no one in particular to fix his jealousy upon
Sometimes he could have thanked the man who would bring him evidence against his wife
He had discharged a good farmboy Jan Smirka because he thought Marie was fond of him but she had not seemed to miss Jan when he was gone and she had been just as kind to the next boy
The farmhands would always do anything for Marie Frank couldnt find one so surly that he would not make an effort to please her
At the bottom of his heart Frank knew well enough that if he could once give up his grudge his wife would come back to him
But he could never in the world do that
The grudge was fundamental
Perhaps he could not have given it up if he had tried
Perhaps he got more satisfaction out of feeling himself abused than he would have got out of being loved
If he could once have made Marie thoroughly un happy he might have relented and raised her from the dust
But she had never humbled her self
In the first days of their love she had been his slave she had admired him abandonedly
But the moment he began to bully her and to be unjust she began to draw away at first in tear ful amazement then in quiet unspoken dis gust
The distance between them had widened and hardened
It no longer contracted and brought them suddenly together
The spark of her life went somewhere else and he was always watching to surprise it
He knew that some where she must get a feeling to live upon for she was not a woman who could live without loving
He wanted to prove to himself the wrong he felt
What did she hide in her heart
Where did it go
Even Frank had his churlish delicacies he never reminded her of how much she had once loved him
For that Marie was grateful to him
While Marie was chattering to the French boys Amedee called Emil to the back of the room and whispered to him that they were going to play a joke on the girls
At eleven oclock Amedee was to go up to the switchboard in the vestibule and turn off the electric lights and every boy would have a chance to kiss his sweetheart before Father Duchesne could find his way up the stairs to turn the current on again
The only difficulty was the candle in Maries tent perhaps as Emil had no sweet heart he would oblige the boys by blowing out the candle
Emil said he would undertake to do that
At five minutes to eleven he sauntered up to Maries booth and the French boys dispersed to find their girls
He leaned over the card table and gave himself up to looking at her
Do you think you could tell my fortune
he murmured
It was the first word he had had alone with her for almost a year
My luck hasnt changed any
Its just the same
Marie had often wondered whether there was anyone else who could look his thoughts to you as Emil could
Tonight when she met his steady powerful eyes it was impossible not to feel the sweetness of the dream he was dreaming it reached her before she could shut it out and hid itself in her heart
She began to shuffle her cards furiously
Im angry with you Emil she broke out with petu lance
Why did you give them that lovely blue stone to sell
You might have known Frank wouldnt buy it for me and I wanted it awfully
Emil laughed shortly
People who want such little things surely ought to have them he said dryly
He thrust his hand into the pocket of his velvet trousers and brought out a handful of uncut turquoises as big as marbles
Leaning over the table he dropped them into her lap
There will those do
Be careful dont let any one see them
Now I suppose you want me to go away and let you play with them
Marie was gazing in rapture at the soft blue color of the stones
Oh Emil
Is everything down there beautiful like these
How could you ever come away
At that instant Amedee laid hands on the switchboard
There was a shiver and a giggle and every one looked toward the red blur that Maries candle made in the dark
Immediately that too was gone
Little shrieks and currents of soft laughter ran up and down the dark hall
Marie started updirectly into Emils arms
In the same instant she felt his lips
The veil that had hung uncertainly between them for so long was dissolved
Before she knew what she was doing she had committed herself to that kiss that was at once a boys and a mans as timid as it was tender so like Emil and so unlike any one else in the world
Not until it was over did she realize what it meant
And Emil who had so often imagined the shock of this first kiss was surprised at its gentleness and naturalness
It was like a sigh which they had breathed together almost sorrowful as if each were afraid of wakening something in the other
When the lights came on again everybody was laughing and shouting and all the French girls were rosy and shining with mirth
Only Marie in her little tent of shawls was pale and quiet
Under her yellow turban the red coral pendants swung against white cheeks
Frank was still staring at her but he seemed to see nothing
Years ago he himself had had the power to take the blood from her cheeks like that
Perhaps he did not rememberperhaps he had never noticed
Emil was already at the other end of the hall walking about with the shouldermotion he had acquired among the Mexicans studying the floor with his intent deepset eyes
Marie began to take down and fold her shawls
She did not glance up again
The young people drifted to the other end of the hall where the guitar was sounding
In a mo ment she heard Emil and Raoul singing Across the Rio Grande There lies a sunny lande My brighteyed Mexico
Alexandra Bergson came up to the card booth
Let me help you Marie
You look tired
She placed her hand on Maries arm and felt her shiver
Marie stiffened under that kind calm hand
Alexandra drew back perplexed and hurt
There was about Alexandra something of the impervious calm of the fatalist always discon certing to very young people who cannot feel that the heart lives at all unless it is still at the mercy of storms unless its strings can scream to the touch of pain
II Signas wedding supper was over
The guests and the tiresome little Norwegian preacher who had performed the marriage cere mony were saying goodnight
Old Ivar was hitching the horses to the wagon to take the wedding presents and the bride and groom up to their new home on Alexandras north quarter
When Ivar drove up to the gate Emil and Marie Shabata began to carry out the presents and Alexandra went into her bedroom to bid Signa goodbye and to give her a few words of good counsel
She was surprised to find that the bride had changed her slippers for heavy shoes and was pinning up her skirts
At that moment Nelse appeared at the gate with the two milk cows that Alexandra had given Signa for a wedding present
Alexandra began to laugh
Why Signa you and Nelse are to ride home
Ill send Ivar over with the cows in the morning
Signa hesitated and looked perplexed
When her husband called her she pinned her hat on resolutely
I taank I better do yust like he say she murmured in confusion
Alexandra and Marie accompanied Signa to the gate and saw the party set off old Ivar driving ahead in the wagon and the bride and groom following on foot each leading a cow
Emil burst into a laugh before they were out of hearing
Those two will get on said Alexandra as they turned back to the house
They are not going to take any chances
They will feel safer with those cows in their own stable
Marie I am going to send for an old woman next
As soon as I get the girls broken in I marry them off
Ive no patience with Signa marrying that grumpy fellow
Marie declared
I wanted her to marry that nice Smirka boy who worked for us last winter
I think she liked him too
Yes I think she did Alexandra assented but I suppose she was too much afraid of Nelse to marry any one else
Now that I think of it most of my girls have married men they were afraid of
I believe there is a good deal of the cow in most Swedish girls
You highstrung Bohemian cant understand us
Were a ter ribly practical people and I guess we think a cross man makes a good manager
Marie shrugged her shoulders and turned to pin up a lock of hair that had fallen on her neck
Somehow Alexandra had irritated her of late
Everybody irritated her
She was tired of everybody
Im going home alone Emil so you neednt get your hat she said as she wound her scarf quickly about her head
Goodnight Alexandra she called back in a strained voice running down the gravel walk
Emil followed with long strides until he over took her
Then she began to walk slowly
It was a night of warm wind and faint starlight and the fireflies were glimmering over the wheat
Marie said Emil after they had walked for a while I wonder if you know how un happy I am
Marie did not answer him
Her head in its white scarf drooped forward a little
Emil kicked a clod from the path and went on I wonder whether you are really shallow hearted like you seem
Sometimes I think one boy does just as well as another for you
It never seems to make much difference whether it is me or Raoul Marcel or Jan Smirka
Are you really like that
Perhaps I am
What do you want me to do
Sit round and cry all day
When Ive cried until I cant cry any more thenthen I must do something else
Are you sorry for me
he persisted
No Im not
If I were big and free like you I wouldnt let anything make me unhappy
As old Napoleon Brunot said at the fair I wouldnt go lovering after no woman
Id take the first train and go off and have all the fun there is
I tried that but it didnt do any good
Everything reminded me
The nicer the place was the more I wanted you
They had come to the stile and Emil pointed to it persuasively
Sit down a moment I want to ask you some thing
Marie sat down on the top step and Emil drew nearer
Would you tell me some thing thats none of my business if you thought it would help me out
Well then tell me PLEASE tell me why you ran away with Frank Sha bata
Marie drew back
Because I was in love with him she said firmly
Really
he asked incredulously
Yes indeed
Very much in love with him
I think I was the one who suggested our run ning away
From the first it was more my fault than his
Emil turned away his face
And now Marie went on Ive got to remember that
Frank is just the same now as he was then only then I would see him as I wanted him to be
I would have my own way
And now I pay for it
You dont do all the paying
Thats it
When one makes a mistake theres no telling where it will stop
But you can go away you can leave all this behind you
Not everything
I cant leave you behind
Will you go away with me Marie
Marie started up and stepped across the stile
Emil
How wickedly you talk
I am not that kind of a girl and you know it
But what am I going to do if you keep tormenting me like this
she added plaintively
Marie I wont bother you any more if you will tell me just one thing
Stop a minute and look at me
No nobody can see us
Every bodys asleep
That was only a firefly
Marie STOP and tell me
Emil overtook her and catching her by the shoulders shook her gently as if he were trying to awaken a sleepwalker
Marie hid her face on his arm
Dont ask me anything more
I dont know anything except how miserable I am
And I thought it would be all right when you came back
Oh Emil she clutched his sleeve and began to cry what am I to do if you dont go away
I cant go and one of us must
Cant you see
Emil stood looking down at her holding his shoulders stiff and stiffening the arm to which she clung
Her white dress looked gray in the darkness
She seemed like a troubled spirit like some shadow out of the earth clinging to him and entreating him to give her peace
Be hind her the fireflies were weaving in and out over the wheat
He put his hand on her bent head
On my honor Marie if you will say you love me I will go away
She lifted her face to his
How could I help it
Didnt you know
Emil was the one who trembled through all his frame
After he left Marie at her gate he wandered about the fields all night till morning put out the fireflies and the stars
III One evening a week after Signas wedding Emil was kneeling before a box in the sitting room packing his books
From time to time he rose and wandered about the house picking up stray volumes and bringing them listlessly back to his box
He was packing without enthusi asm
He was not very sanguine about his fu ture
Alexandra sat sewing by the table
She had helped him pack his trunk in the afternoon
As Emil came and went by her chair with his books he thought to himself that it had not been so hard to leave his sister since he first went away to school
He was going directly to Omaha to read law in the office of a Swedish lawyer until October when he would enter the law school at Ann Arbor
They had planned that Alexandra was to come to Michigana long journey for herat Christmas time and spend several weeks with him
Nevertheless he felt that this leavetaking would be more final than his earlier ones had been that it meant a definite break with his old home and the begin ning of something newhe did not know what
His ideas about the future would not crystallize the more he tried to think about it the vaguer his conception of it became
But one thing was clear he told himself it was high time that he made good to Alexandra and that ought to be incentive enough to begin with
As he went about gathering up his books he felt as if he were uprooting things
At last he threw himself down on the old slat lounge where he had slept when he was little and lay looking up at the familiar cracks in the ceiling
Tired Emil
his sister asked
Lazy he murmured turning on his side and looking at her
He studied Alexandras face for a long time in the lamplight
It had never occurred to him that his sister was a handsome woman until Marie Shabata had told him so
Indeed he had never thought of her as being a woman at all only a sister
As he studied her bent head he looked up at the picture of John Bergson above the lamp
No he thought to himself she didnt get it there
I suppose I am more like that
Alexandra he said suddenly that old walnut secretary you use for a desk was fathers wasnt it
Alexandra went on stitching
Yes
It was one of the first things he bought for the old log house
It was a great extravagance in those days
But he wrote a great many letters back to the old country
He had many friends there and they wrote to him up to the time he died
No one ever blamed him for grandfathers dis grace
I can see him now sitting there on Sun days in his white shirt writing pages and pages so carefully
He wrote a fine regular hand almost like engraving
Yours is some thing like his when you take pains
Grandfather was really crooked was he
He married an unscrupulous woman and thenthen Im afraid he was really crooked
When we first came here father used to have dreams about making a great fortune and going back to Sweden to pay back to the poor sailors the money grandfather had lost
Emil stirred on the lounge
I say that would have been worth while wouldnt it
Father wasnt a bit like Lou or Oscar was he
I cant remember much about him before he got sick
Oh not at all
Alexandra dropped her sewing on her knee
He had better opportuni ties not to make money but to make some thing of himself
He was a quiet man but he was very intelligent
You would have been proud of him Emil
Alexandra felt that he would like to know there had been a man of his kin whom he could admire
She knew that Emil was ashamed of Lou and Oscar because they were bigoted and selfsatisfied
He never said much about them but she could feel his disgust
His brothers had shown their disapproval of him ever since he first went away to school
The only thing that would have satisfied them would have been his failure at the University
As it was they resented every change in his speech in his dress in his point of view though the latter they had to conjecture for Emil avoided talking to them about any but family matters
All his interests they treated as affectations
Alexandra took up her sewing again
I can remember father when he was quite a young man
He belonged to some kind of a musical society a male chorus in Stockholm
I can remember going with mother to hear them sing
There must have been a hundred of them and they all wore long black coats and white neck ties
I was used to seeing father in a blue coat a sort of jacket and when I recognized him on the platform I was very proud
Do you remember that Swedish song he taught you about the ship boy
Yes
I used to sing it to the Mexicans
They like anything different
Emil paused
Father had a hard fight here didnt he
he added thoughtfully
Yes and he died in a dark time
Still he had hope
He believed in the land
And in you I guess Emil said to himself
There was another period of silence that warm friendly silence full of perfect understanding in which Emil and Alexandra had spent many of their happiest halfhours
At last Emil said abruptly Lou and Oscar would be better off if they were poor wouldnt they
Alexandra smiled
Maybe
But their chil dren wouldnt
I have great hopes of Milly
Emil shivered
I dont know
Seems to me it gets worse as it goes on
The worst of the Swedes is that theyre never willing to find out how much they dont know
It was like that at the University
Always so pleased with them selves
Theres no getting behind that con ceited Swedish grin
The Bohemians and Ger mans were so different
Come Emil dont go back on your own people
Father wasnt conceited Uncle Otto wasnt
Even Lou and Oscar werent when they were boys
Emil looked incredulous but he did not dis pute the point
He turned on his back and lay still for a long time his hands locked under his head looking up at the ceiling
Alexandra knew that he was thinking of many things
She felt no anxiety about Emil
She had always believed in him as she had believed in the land
He had been more like himself since he got back from Mexico seemed glad to be at home and talked to her as he used to do
She had no doubt that his wandering fit was over and that he would soon be settled in life
Alexandra said Emil suddenly do you remember the wild duck we saw down on the river that time
His sister looked up
I often think of her
It always seems to me shes there still just like we saw her
I know
Its queer what things one re members and what things one forgets
Emil yawned and sat up
Well its time to turn in
He rose and going over to Alexandra stooped down and kissed her lightly on the cheek
Goodnight sister
I think you did pretty well by us
Emil took up his lamp and went upstairs
Alexandra sat finishing his new nightshirt that must go in the top tray of his trunk
IV The next morning Angelique Amedees wife was in the kitchen baking pies assisted by old Mrs Chevalier
Between the mixingboard and the stove stood the old cradle that had been Amedees and in it was his blackeyed son
As Angelique flushed and excited with flour on her hands stopped to smile at the baby Emil Bergson rode up to the kitchen door on his mare and dismounted
Medee is out in the field Emil Angelique called as she ran across the kitchen to the oven
He begins to cut his wheat today the first wheat ready to cut anywhere about here
He bought a new header you know because all the wheats so short this year
I hope he can rent it to the neighbors it cost so much
He and his cousins bought a steam thresher on shares
You ought to go out and see that header work
I watched it an hour this morning busy as I am with all the men to feed
He has a lot of hands but hes the only one that knows how to drive the header or how to run the engine so he has to be everywhere at once
Hes sick too and ought to be in his bed
Emil bent over Hector Baptiste trying to make him blink his round beadlike black eyes
Sick
Whats the matter with your daddy kid
Been making him walk the floor with you
Angelique sniffed
Not much
We dont have that kind of babies
It was his father that kept Baptiste awake
All night I had to be get ting up and making mustard plasters to put on his stomach
He had an awful colic
He said he felt better this morning but I dont think he ought to be out in the field overheating him self
Angelique did not speak with much anxiety not because she was indifferent but because she felt so secure in their good fortune
Only good things could happen to a rich energetic hand some young man like Amedee with a new baby in the cradle and a new header in the field
Emil stroked the black fuzz on Baptistes head
I say Angelique one of Medees grand mothers way back must have been a squaw
This kid looks exactly like the Indian babies
Angelique made a face at him but old Mrs Chevalier had been touched on a sore point and she let out such a stream of fiery PATOIS that Emil fled from the kitchen and mounted his mare
Opening the pasture gate from the saddle Emil rode across the field to the clearing where the thresher stood driven by a stationary engine and fed from the header boxes
As Amedee was not on the engine Emil rode on to the wheatfield where he recognized on the header the slight wiry figure of his friend coatless his white shirt puffed out by the wind his straw hat stuck jauntily on the side of his head
The six big workhorses that drew or rather pushed the header went abreast at a rapid walk and as they were still green at the work they required a good deal of management on Amedees part especially when they turned the corners where they divided three and three and then swung round into line again with a movement that looked as complicated as a wheel of artillery
Emil felt a new thrill of admiration for his friend and with it the old pang of envy at the way in which Amedee could do with his might what his hand found to do and feel that whatever it was it was the most important thing in the world
Ill have to bring Alexandra up to see this thing work Emil thought its splendid
When he saw Emil Amedee waved to him and called to one of his twenty cousins to take the reins
Stepping off the header without stopping it he ran up to Emil who had dis mounted
Come along he called
I have to go over to the engine for a minute
I gotta green man running it and I gotta to keep an eye on him
Emil thought the lad was unnaturally flushed and more excited than even the cares of manag ing a big farm at a critical time warranted
As they passed behind a last years stack Amedee clutched at his right side and sank down for a moment on the straw
Ouch
I got an awful pain in me Emil
Somethings the matter with my insides for sure
Emil felt his fiery cheek
You ought to go straight to bed Medee and telephone for the doctor thats what you ought to do
Amedee staggered up with a gesture of despair
How can I
I got no time to be sick
Three thousand dollars worth of new machin ery to manage and the wheat so ripe it will begin to shatter next week
My wheats short but its gotta grand full berries
Whats he slowing down for
We havent got header boxes enough to feed the thresher I guess
Amedee started hotfoot across the stubble leaning a little to the right as he ran and waved to the engineer not to stop the engine
Emil saw that this was no time to talk about his own affairs
He mounted his mare and rode on to SainteAgnes to bid his friends there goodbye
He went first to see Raoul Marcel and found him innocently practising the Gloria for the big confirmation service on Sunday while he polished the mirrors of his fathers saloon
As Emil rode homewards at three oclock in the afternoon he saw Amedee staggering out of the wheatfield supported by two of his cousins
Emil stopped and helped them put the boy to bed
V When Frank Shabata came in from work at five oclock that evening old Moses Marcel Raouls father telephoned him that Amedee had had a seizure in the wheatfield and that Doctor Paradis was going to operate on him as soon as the Hanover doctor got there to help
Frank dropped a word of this at the table bolted his supper and rode off to Sainte Agnes where there would be sympathetic dis cussion of Amedees case at Marcels saloon
As soon as Frank was gone Marie telephoned Alexandra
It was a comfort to hear her friends voice
Yes Alexandra knew what there was to be known about Amedee
Emil had been there when they carried him out of the field and had stayed with him until the doctors operated for appendicitis at five oclock
They were afraid it was too late to do much good it should have been done three days ago
Amedee was in a very bad way
Emil had just come home worn out and sick himself
She had given him some brandy and put him to bed
Marie hung up the receiver
Poor Amedees illness had taken on a new meaning to her now that she knew Emil had been with him
And it might so easily have been the other way Emil who was ill and Amedee who was sad
Marie looked about the dusky sittingroom
She had seldom felt so utterly lonely
If Emil was asleep there was not even a chance of his coming and she could not go to Alexandra for sympathy
She meant to tell Alexandra every thing as soon as Emil went away
Then what ever was left between them would be honest
But she could not stay in the house this evening
Where should she go
She walked slowly down through the orchard where the evening air was heavy with the smell of wild cotton
The fresh salty scent of the wild roses had given way before this more powerful per fume of midsummer
Wherever those ashesof rose balls hung on their milky stalks the air about them was saturated with their breath
The sky was still red in the west and the even ing star hung directly over the Bergsons wind mill
Marie crossed the fence at the wheatfield corner and walked slowly along the path that led to Alexandras
She could not help feeling hurt that Emil had not come to tell her about Amedee
It seemed to her most unnatural that he should not have come
If she were in trou ble certainly he was the one person in the world she would want to see
Perhaps he wished her to understand that for her he was as good as gone already
Marie stole slowly flutteringly along the path like a white nightmoth out of the fields
The years seemed to stretch before her like the land spring summer autumn winter spring always the same patient fields the patient little trees the patient lives always the same yearn ing the same pulling at the chainuntil the instinct to live had torn itself and bled and weakened for the last time until the chain secured a dead woman who might cautiously be released
Marie walked on her face lifted toward the remote inaccessible evening star
When she reached the stile she sat down and waited
How terrible it was to love people when you could not really share their lives
Yes in so far as she was concerned Emil was already gone
They couldnt meet any more
There was nothing for them to say
They had spent the last penny of their small change there was nothing left but gold
The day of lovetokens was past
They had now only their hearts to give each other
And Emil being gone what was her life to be like
In some ways it would be easier
She would not at least live in perpetual fear
If Emil were once away and settled at work she would not have the feeling that she was spoiling his life
With the memory he left her she could be as rash as she chose
Nobody could be the worse for it but herself and that surely did not matter
Her own case was clear
When a girl had loved one man and then loved another while that man was still alive everybody knew what to think of her
What happened to her was of little con sequence so long as she did not drag other people down with her
Emil once away she could let everything else go and live a new life of perfect love
Marie left the stile reluctantly
She had after all thought he might come
And how glad she ought to be she told herself that he was asleep
She left the path and went across the pasture
The moon was almost full
An owl was hooting somewhere in the fields
She had scarcely thought about where she was going when the pond glittered before her where Emil had shot the ducks
She stopped and looked at it
Yes there would be a dirty way out of life if one chose to take it
But she did not want to die
She wanted to live and dreama hundred years forever
As long as this sweetness welled up in her heart as long as her breast could hold this treasure of pain
She felt as the pond must feel when it held the moon like that when it encircled and swelled with In the morning when Emil came down stairs Alexandra met him in the sittingroom and put her hands on his shoulders
Emil I went to your room as soon as it was light but you were sleeping so sound I hated to wake you
There was nothing you could do so I let you sleep
They telephoned from Sainte Agnes that Amedee died at three oclock this morning
VI The Church has always held that life is for the living
On Saturday while half the vil lage of SainteAgnes was mourning for Ame dee and preparing the funeral black for his burial on Monday the other half was busy with white dresses and white veils for the great confirmation service tomorrow when the bishop was to confirm a class of one hundred boys and girls
Father Duchesne divided his time between the living and the dead
All day Saturday the church was a scene of bustling activity a little hushed by the thought of Amedee
The choir were busy rehearsing a mass of Rossini which they had studied and practised for this occasion
The women were trimming the altar the boys and girls were bringing flowers
On Sunday morning the bishop was to drive overland to SainteAgnes from Hanover and Emil Bergson had been asked to take the place of one of Amedees cousins in the cavalcade of forty French boys who were to ride across coun try to meet the bishops carriage
At six oclock on Sunday morning the boys met at the church
As they stood holding their horses by the bridle they talked in low tones of their dead comrade
They kept repeating that Amedee had always been a good boy glancing toward the red brick church which had played so large a part in Amedees life had been the scene of his most serious moments and of his happiest hours
He had played and wrestled and sung and courted under its shadow
Only three weeks ago he had proudly carried his baby there to be christened
They could not doubt that that invisible arm was still about Amedee that through the church on earth he had passed to the church triumph ant the goal of the hopes and faith of so many hundred years
When the word was given to mount the young men rode at a walk out of the village but once out among the wheatfields in the morning sun their horses and their own youth got the better of them
A wave of zeal and fiery enthusiasm swept over them
They longed for a Jerusalem to deliver
The thud of their gal loping hoofs interrupted many a country break fast and brought many a woman and child to the door of the farmhouses as they passed
Five miles east of SainteAgnes they met the bishop in his open carriage attended by two priests
Like one man the boys swung off their hats in a broad salute and bowed their heads as the handsome old man lifted his two fingers in the episcopal blessing
The horsemen closed about the carriage like a guard and whenever a rest less horse broke from control and shot down the road ahead of the body the bishop laughed and rubbed his plump hands together
What fine boys
he said to his priests
The Church still has her cavalry
As the troop swept past the graveyard half a mile east of the townthe first frame church of the parish had stood thereold Pierre Seguin was already out with his pick and spade digging Amedees grave
He knelt and un covered as the bishop passed
The boys with one accord looked away from old Pierre to the red church on the hill with the gold cross flaming on its steeple
Mass was at eleven
While the church was filling Emil Bergson waited outside watching the wagons and buggies drive up the hill
After the bell began to ring he saw Frank Shabata ride up on horseback and tie his horse to the hitchbar
Marie then was not coming
Emil turned and went into the church
Amedees was the only empty pew and he sat down in it
Some of Amedees cousins were there dressed in black and weeping
When all the pews were full the old men and boys packed the open space at the back of the church kneeling on the floor
There was scarcely a family in town that was not represented in the confirmation class by a cousin at least
The new communicants with their clear reverent faces were beautiful to look upon as they entered in a body and took the front benches reserved for them
Even before the Mass began the air was charged with feeling
The choir had never sung so well and Raoul Marcel in the Gloria drew even the bishops eyes to the organ loft
For the offertory he sang Gounods Ave Maria always spoken of in SainteAgnes as the Ave Maria
Emil began to torture himself with questions about Marie
Was she ill
Had she quarreled with her husband
Was she too unhappy to find comfort even here
Had she perhaps thought that he would come to her
Was she waiting for him
Overtaxed by excitement and sorrow as he was the rapture of the service took hold upon his body and mind
As he listened to Raoul he seemed to emerge from the con flicting emotions which had been whirling him about and sucking him under
He felt as if a clear light broke upon his mind and with it a conviction that good was after all stronger than evil and that good was possible to men
He seemed to discover that there was a kind of rapture in which he could love forever with out faltering and without sin
He looked across the heads of the people at Frank Shabata with calmness
That rapture was for those who could feel it for people who could not it was nonexistent
He coveted nothing that was Frank Shabatas
The spirit he had met in music was his own
Frank Shabata had never found it would never find it if he lived beside it a thousand years would have destroyed it if he had found it as Herod slew the innocents as Rome slew the martyrs
SANCTA MARIIIA wailed Raoul from the organ loft ORA PRO NOOBIS
And it did not occur to Emil that any one had ever reasoned thus before that music had ever before given a man this equivocal revelation
The confirmation service followed the Mass
When it was over the congregation thronged about the newly confirmed
The girls and even the boys were kissed and embraced and wept over
All the aunts and grandmothers wept with joy
The housewives had much ado to tear themselves away from the general rejoicing and hurry back to their kitchens
The country parishioners were staying in town for dinner and nearly every house in SainteAgnes enter tained visitors that day
Father Duchesne the bishop and the visiting priests dined with Fabien Sauvage the banker
Emil and Frank Shabata were both guests of old Moise Marcel
After dinner Frank and old Moise retired to the rear room of the saloon to play California Jack and drink their cognac and Emil went over to the bankers with Raoul who had been asked to sing for the bishop
At three oclock Emil felt that he could stand it no longer
He slipped out under cover of The Holy City followed by Malvinas wistful eye and went to the stable for his mare
He was at that height of excitement from which everything is foreshortened from which life seems short and simple death very near and the soul seems to soar like an eagle
As he rode past the graveyard he looked at the brown hole in the earth where Amedee was to lie and felt no horror
That too was beautiful that simple doorway into forgetfulness
The heart when it is too much alive aches for that brown earth and ecstasy has no fear of death
It is the old and the poor and the maimed who shrink from that brown hole its wooers are found among the young the passionate the gallanthearted
It was not until he had passed the graveyard that Emil realized where he was going
It was the hour for saying goodbye
It might be the last time that he would see her alone and to day he could leave her without rancor without bitterness
Everywhere the grain stood ripe and the hot afternoon was full of the smell of the ripe wheat like the smell of bread baking in an oven
The breath of the wheat and the sweet clover passed him like pleasant things in a dream
He could feel nothing but the sense of diminishing dis tance
It seemed to him that his mare was fly ing or running on wheels like a railway train
The sunlight flashing on the windowglass of the big red barns drove him wild with joy
He was like an arrow shot from the bow
His life poured itself out along the road before him as he rode to the Shabata farm
When Emil alighted at the Shabatas gate his horse was in a lather
He tied her in the stable and hurried to the house
It was empty
She might be at Mrs Hillers or with Alexan dra
But anything that reminded him of her would be enough the orchard the mulberry tree


When he reached the orchard the sun was hanging low over the wheatfield
Long fingers of light reached through the apple branches as through a net the orchard was rid dled and shot with gold light was the reality the trees were merely interferences that reflected and refracted light
Emil went softly down between the cherry trees toward the wheatfield
When he came to the corner he stopped short and put his hand over his mouth
Marie was lying on her side under the white mulberry tree her face half hidden in the grass her eyes closed her hands lying limply where they had happened to fall
She had lived a day of her new life of perfect love and it had left her like this
Her breast rose and fell faintly as if she were asleep
Emil threw himself down beside her and took her in his arms
The blood came back to her cheeks her amber eyes opened slowly and in them Emil saw his own face and the orchard and the sun
I was dreaming this she whis pered hiding her face against him dont take my dream away
VII When Frank Shabata got home that night he found Emils mare in his stable
Such an impertinence amazed him
Like everybody else Frank had had an exciting day
Since noon he had been drinking too much and he was in a bad temper
He talked bitterly to him self while he put his own horse away and as he went up the path and saw that the house was dark he felt an added sense of injury
He ap proached quietly and listened on the doorstep
Hearing nothing he opened the kitchen door and went softly from one room to another
Then he went through the house again up stairs and down with no better result
He sat down on the bottom step of the box stairway and tried to get his wits together
In that un natural quiet there was no sound but his own heavy breathing
Suddenly an owl began to hoot out in the fields
Frank lifted his head
An idea flashed into his mind and his sense of injury and outrage grew
He went into his bedroom and took his murderous 405 Winches ter from the closet
When Frank took up his gun and walked out of the house he had not the faintest purpose of doing anything with it
He did not believe that he had any real grievance
But it gratified him to feel like a desperate man
He had got into the habit of seeing himself always in desperate straits
His unhappy temperament was like a cage he could never get out of it and he felt that other people his wife in particular must have put him there
It had never more than dimly occurred to Frank that he made his own unhappiness
Though he took up his gun with dark projects in his mind he would have been paralyzed with fright had he known that there was the slightest probability of his ever carry ing any of them out
Frank went slowly down to the orchard gate stopped and stood for a moment lost in thought
He retraced his steps and looked through the barn and the hayloft
Then he went out to the road where he took the foot path along the outside of the orchard hedge
The hedge was twice as tall as Frank himself and so dense that one could see through it only by peering closely between the leaves
He could see the empty path a long way in the moonlight
His mind traveled ahead to the stile which he always thought of as haunted by Emil Bergson
But why had he left his horse
At the wheatfield corner where the orchard hedge ended and the path led across the pasture to the Bergsons Frank stopped
In the warm breathless night air he heard a murmuring sound perfectly inarticulate as low as the sound of water coming from a spring where there is no fall and where there are no stones to fret it
Frank strained his ears
It ceased
He held his breath and began to tremble
Resting the butt of his gun on the ground he parted the mulberry leaves softly with his fingers and peered through the hedge at the dark figures on the grass in the shadow of the mulberry tree
It seemed to him that they must feel his eyes that they must hear him breathing
But they did not
Frank who had always wanted to see things blacker than they were for once wanted to believe less than he saw
The woman lying in the shadow might so easily be one of the Bergsons farmgirls



Again the murmur like water welling out of the ground
This time he heard it more distinctly and his blood was quicker than his brain
He began to act just as a man who falls into the fire begins to act
The gun sprang to his shoulder he sighted mechani cally and fired three times without stopping stopped without knowing why
Either he shut his eyes or he had vertigo
He did not see any thing while he was firing
He thought he heard a cry simultaneous with the second report but he was not sure
He peered again through the hedge at the two dark figures under the tree
They had fallen a little apart from each other and were perfectly still No not quite in a white patch of light where the moon shone through the branches a mans hand was pluck ing spasmodically at the grass
Suddenly the woman stirred and uttered a cry then another and another
She was living
She was dragging herself toward the hedge
Frank dropped his gun and ran back along the path shaking stumbling gasping
He had never imagined such horror
The cries fol lowed him
They grew fainter and thicker as if she were choking
He dropped on his knees beside the hedge and crouched like a rabbit listening fainter fainter a sound like a whine againa moananothersilence
Frank scrambled to his feet and ran on groaning and praying
From habit he went toward the house where he was used to being soothed when he had worked himself into a frenzy but at the sight of the black open door he started back
He knew that he had murdered somebody that a woman was bleeding and moaning in the or chard but he had not realized before that it was his wife
The gate stared him in the face
He threw his hands over his head
Which way to turn
He lifted his tormented face and looked at the sky
Holy Mother of God not to suffer
She was a good girlnot to suffer
Frank had been wont to see himself in dra matic situations but now when he stood by the windmill in the bright space between the barn and the house facing his own black doorway he did not see himself at all
He stood like the hare when the dogs are approaching from all sides
And he ran like a hare back and forth about that moonlit space before he could make up his mind to go into the dark stable for a horse
The thought of going into a doorway was terrible to him
He caught Emils horse by the bit and led it out
He could not have buckled a bridle on his own
After two or three attempts he lifted himself into the sad dle and started for Hanover
If he could catch the one oclock train he had money enough to get as far as Omaha
While he was thinking dully of this in some less sensitized part of his brain his acuter faculties were going over and over the cries he had heard in the orchard
Terror was the only thing that kept him from going back to her terror that she might still be she that she might still be suffering
A woman mutilated and bleeding in his orchardit was because it was a woman that he was so afraid
It was incon ceivable that he should have hurt a woman
He would rather be eaten by wild beasts than see her move on the ground as she had moved in the orchard
Why had she been so careless
She knew he was like a crazy man when he was angry
She had more than once taken that gun away from him and held it when he was angry with other people
Once it had gone off while they were struggling over it
She was never afraid
But when she knew him why hadnt she been more careful
Didnt she have all summer before her to love Emil Bergson in without taking such chances
Probably she had met the Smirka boy too down there in the orchard
He didnt care
She could have met all the men on the Divide there and welcome if only she hadnt brought this horror on him
There was a wrench in Franks mind
He did not honestly believe that of her
He knew that he was doing her wrong
He stopped his horse to admit this to himself the more directly to think it out the more clearly
He knew that he was to blame
For three years he had been trying to break her spirit
She had a way of making the best of things that seemed to him a sentimental affectation
He wanted his wife to resent that he was wasting his best years among these stupid and unappreciative people but she had seemed to find the people quite good enough
If he ever got rich he meant to buy her pretty clothes and take her to California in a Pullman car and treat her like a lady but in the mean time he wanted her to feel that life was as ugly and as unjust as he felt it
He had tried to make her life ugly
He had refused to share any of the little pleasures she was so plucky about making for herself
She could be gay about the least thing in the world but she must be gay
When she first came to him her faith in him her adoration Frank struck the mare with his fist
Why had Marie made him do this thing why had she brought this upon him
He was overwhelmed by sickening mis fortune
All at once he heard her cries again he had forgotten for a moment
Maria he sobbed aloud Maria
When Frank was halfway to Hanover the motion of his horse brought on a violent attack of nausea
After it had passed he rode on again but he could think of nothing except his physical weakness and his desire to be com forted by his wife
He wanted to get into his own bed
Had his wife been at home he would have turned and gone back to her meekly enough
VIII When old Ivar climbed down from his loft at four oclock the next morning he came upon Emils mare jaded and latherstained her bridle broken chewing the scattered tufts of hay outside the stable door
The old man was thrown into a fright at once
He put the mare in her stall threw her a measure of oats and then set out as fast as his bowlegs could carry him on the path to the nearest neighbor
Something is wrong with that boy
Some misfortune has come upon us
He would never have used her so in his right senses
It is not his way to abuse his mare the old man kept muttering as he scuttled through the short wet pasture grass on his bare feet
While Ivar was hurrying across the fields the first long rays of the sun were reaching down between the orchard boughs to those two dew drenched figures
The story of what had hap pened was written plainly on the orchard grass and on the white mulberries that had fallen in the night and were covered with dark stain
For Emil the chapter had been short
He was shot in the heart and had rolled over on his back and died
His face was turned up to the sky and his brows were drawn in a frown as if he had realized that something had befallen him
But for Marie Shabata it had not been so easy
One ball had torn through her right lung another had shattered the carotid artery
She must have started up and gone toward the hedge leaving a trail of blood
There she had fallen and bled
From that spot there was another trail heavier than the first where she must have dragged herself back to Emils body
Once there she seemed not to have struggled any more
She had lifted her head to her lovers breast taken his hand in both her own and bled quietly to death
She was lying on her right side in an easy and natural position her cheek on Emils shoulder
On her face there was a look of ineffable content
Her lips were parted a little her eyes were lightly closed as if in a daydream or a light slumber
After she lay down there she seemed not to have moved an eyelash
The hand she held was covered with dark stains where she had kissed it
But the stained slippery grass the darkened mulberries told only half the story
Above Marie and Emil two white butterflies from Franks alfalfafield were fluttering in and out among the interlacing shadows diving and soaring now close together now far apart and in the long grass by the fence the last wild roses of the year opened their pink hearts to die
When Ivar reached the path by the hedge he saw Shabatas rifle lying in the way
He turned and peered through the branches falling upon his knees as if his legs had been mowed from under him
Merciful God
he groaned Alexandra too had risen early that morning because of her anxiety about Emil
She was in Emils room upstairs when from the window she saw Ivar coming along the path that led from the Shabatas
He was running like a spent man tottering and lurching from side to side
Ivar never drank and Alexandra thought at once that one of his spells had come upon him and that he must be in a very bad way indeed
She ran downstairs and hurried out to meet him to hide his infirmity from the eyes of her household
The old man fell in the road at her feet and caught her hand over which he bowed his shaggy head
Mistress mistress he sobbed it has fallen
Sin and death for the young ones
God have mercy upon us
PART V Alexandra I Ivar was sitting at a cobblers bench in the barn mending harness by the light of a lantern and repeating to himself the 101st Psalm
It was only five oclock of a midOctober day but a storm had come up in the afternoon bring ing black clouds a cold wind and torrents of rain
The old man wore his buffaloskin coat and occasionally stopped to warm his fingers at the lantern
Suddenly a woman burst into the shed as if she had been blown in accompanied by a shower of raindrops
It was Signa wrapped in a mans overcoat and wearing a pair of boots over her shoes
In time of trouble Signa had come back to stay with her mistress for she was the only one of the maids from whom Alexandra would accept much personal service
It was three months now since the news of the terrible thing that had happened in Frank Shabatas orchard had first run like a fire over the Divide
Signa and Nelse were staying on with Alexandra until winter
Ivar Signa exclaimed as she wiped the rain from her face do you know where she is
The old man put down his cobblers knife
Who the mistress
Yes
She went away about three oclock
I happened to look out of the window and saw her going across the fields in her thin dress and sunhat
And now this storm has come on
I thought she was going to Mrs Hillers and I telephoned as soon as the thunder stopped but she had not been there
Im afraid she is out somewhere and will get her death of cold
Ivar put on his cap and took up the lantern
JA JA we will see
I will hitch the boys mare to the cart and go
Signa followed him across the wagonshed to the horses stable
She was shivering with cold and excitement
Where do you suppose she can be Ivar
The old man lifted a set of single harness carefully from its peg
How should I know
But you think she is at the graveyard dont you
Signa persisted
So do I Oh I wish she would be more like herself
I cant believe its Alexandra Bergson come to this with no head about anything
I have to tell her when to eat and when to go to bed
Patience patience sister muttered Ivar as he settled the bit in the horses mouth
When the eyes of the flesh are shut the eyes of the spirit are open
She will have a message from those who are gone and that will bring her peace
Until then we must bear with her
You and I are the only ones who have weight with her
She trusts us
How awful its been these last three months
Signa held the lantern so that he could see to buckle the straps
It dont seem right that we must all be so miserable
Why do we all have to be punished
Seems to me like good times would never come again
Ivar expressed himself in a deep sigh but said nothing
He stooped and took a sandburr from his toe
Ivar Signa asked suddenly will you tell me why you go barefoot
All the time I lived here in the house I wanted to ask you
Is it for a penance or what
No sister
It is for the indulgence of the body
From my youth up I have had a strong rebellious body and have been subject to every kind of temptation
Even in age my tempta tions are prolonged
It was necessary to make some allowances and the feet as I understand it are free members
There is no divine pro hibition for them in the Ten Commandments
The hands the tongue the eyes the heart all the bodily desires we are commanded to sub due but the feet are free members
I indulge them without harm to any one even to tramp ling in filth when my desires are low
They are quickly cleaned again
Signa did not laugh
She looked thoughtful as she followed Ivar out to the wagonshed and held the shafts up for him while he backed in the mare and buckled the holdbacks
You have been a good friend to the mistress Ivar she murmured
And you God be with you replied Ivar as he clambered into the cart and put the lan tern under the oilcloth lapcover
Now for a ducking my girl he said to the mare gather ing up the reins
As they emerged from the shed a stream of water running off the thatch struck the mare on the neck
She tossed her head indignantly then struck out bravely on the soft ground slipping back again and again as she climbed the hill to the main road
Between the rain and the darkness Ivar could see very little so he let Emils mare have the rein keeping her head in the right direction
When the ground was level he turned her out of the dirt road upon the sod where she was able to trot without slipping
Before Ivar reached the graveyard three miles from the house the storm had spent itself and the downpour had died into a soft dripping rain
The sky and the land were a dark smoke color and seemed to be coming together like two waves
When Ivar stopped at the gate and swung out his lantern a white figure rose from beside John Bergsons white stone
The old man sprang to the ground and shuf fled toward the gate calling Mistress mis tress
Alexandra hurried to meet him and put her hand on his shoulder
TYST
Ivar
Theres nothing to be worried about
Im sorry if Ive scared you all
I didnt notice the storm till it was on me and I couldnt walk against it
Im glad youve come
I am so tired I didnt know how Id ever get home
Ivar swung the lantern up so that it shone in her face
GUD
You are enough to frighten us mistress
You look like a drowned woman
How could you do such a thing
Groaning and mumbling he led her out of the gate and helped her into the cart wrapping her in the dry blankets on which he had been sitting
Alexandra smiled at his solicitude
Not much use in that Ivar
You will only shut the wet in
I dont feel so cold now but Im heavy and numb
Im glad you came
Ivar turned the mare and urged her into a sliding trot
Her feet sent back a continual spatter of mud
Alexandra spoke to the old man as they jogged along through the sullen gray twilight of the storm
Ivar I think it has done me good to get cold clear through like this once
I dont believe I shall suffer so much any more
When you get so near the dead they seem more real than the living
Worldly thoughts leave one
Ever since Emil died Ive suffered so when it rained
Now that Ive been out in it with him I shant dread it
After you once get cold clear through the feeling of the rain on you is sweet
It seems to bring back feelings you had when you were a baby
It carries you back into the dark before you were born you cant see things but they come to you somehow and you know them and arent afraid of them
Maybe its like that with the dead
If they feel anything at all its the old things before they were born that comfort people like the feeling of their own bed does when they are little
Mistress said Ivar reproachfully those are bad thoughts
The dead are in Paradise
Then he hung his head for he did not believe that Emil was in Paradise
When they got home Signa had a fire burn ing in the sittingroom stove
She undressed Alexandra and gave her a hot footbath while Ivar made ginger tea in the kitchen
When Alexandra was in bed wrapped in hot blankets Ivar came in with his tea and saw that she drank it
Signa asked permission to sleep on the slat lounge outside her door
Alexandra endured their attentions patiently but she was glad when they put out the lamp and left her
As she lay alone in the dark it occurred to her for the first time that perhaps she was actually tired of life
All the physical operations of life seemed difficult and painful
She longed to be free from her own body which ached and was so heavy
And longing itself was heavy she yearned to be free of that
As she lay with her eyes closed she had again more vividly than for many years the old illu sion of her girlhood of being lifted and carried lightly by some one very strong
He was with her a long while this time and carried her very far and in his arms she felt free from pain
When he laid her down on her bed again she opened her eyes and for the first time in her life she saw him saw him clearly though the room was dark and his face was covered
He was standing in the doorway of her room
His white cloak was thrown over his face and his head was bent a little forward
His shoulders seemed as strong as the foundations of the world
His right arm bared from the elbow was dark and gleaming like bronze and she knew at once that it was the arm of the mighti est of all lovers
She knew at last for whom it was she had waited and where he would carry her
That she told herself was very well
Then she went to sleep
Alexandra wakened in the morning with nothing worse than a hard cold and a stiff shoulder
She kept her bed for several days and it was during that time that she formed a resolution to go to Lincoln to see Frank Sha bata
Ever since she last saw him in the court room Franks haggard face and wild eyes had haunted her
The trial had lasted only three days
Frank had given himself up to the police in Omaha and pleaded guilty of kill ing without malice and without premeditation
The gun was of course against him and the judge had given him the full sentenceten years
He had now been in the State Peni tentiary for a month
Frank was the only one Alexandra told her self for whom anything could be done
He had been less in the wrong than any of them and he was paying the heaviest penalty
She often felt that she herself had been more to blame than poor Frank
From the time the Shabatas had first moved to the neighboring farm she had omitted no opportunity of throwing Marie and Emil together
Because she knew Frank was surly about doing little things to help his wife she was always sending Emil over to spade or plant or carpenter for Marie
She was glad to have Emil see as much as possible of an intelli gent citybred girl like their neighbor she no ticed that it improved his manners
She knew that Emil was fond of Marie but it had never occurred to her that Emils feeling might be dif ferent from her own
She wondered at herself now but she had never thought of danger in that direction
If Marie had been unmarried oh yes
Then she would have kept her eyes open
But the mere fact that she was Sha batas wife for Alexandra settled everything
That she was beautiful impulsive barely two years older than Emil these facts had had no weight with Alexandra
Emil was a good boy and only bad boys ran after married women
Now Alexandra could in a measure realize that Marie was after all Marie not merely a married woman
Sometimes when Alex andra thought of her it was with an aching tenderness
The moment she had reached them in the orchard that morning everything was clear to her
There was something about those two lying in the grass something in the way Marie had settled her cheek on Emils shoulder that told her everything
She wondered then how they could have helped loving each other how she could have helped knowing that they must
Emils cold frowning face the girls contentAlexandra had felt awe of them even in the first shock of her grief
The idleness of those days in bed the relax ation of body which attended them enabled Alexandra to think more calmly than she had done since Emils death
She and Frank she told herself were left out of that group of friends who had been overwhelmed by disaster
She must certainly see Frank Shabata
Even in the courtroom her heart had grieved for him
He was in a strange country he had no kins men or friends and in a moment he had ruined his life
Being what he was she felt Frank could not have acted otherwise
She could understand his behavior more easily than she could understand Maries
Yes she must go to Lincoln to see Frank Shabata
The day after Emils funeral Alexandra had written to Carl Linstrum a single page of note paper a bare statement of what had happened
She was not a woman who could write much about such a thing and about her own feelings she could never write very freely
She knew that Carl was away from postoffices prospect ing somewhere in the interior
Before he started he had written her where he expected to go but her ideas about Alaska were vague
As the weeks went by and she heard nothing from him it seemed to Alexandra that her heart grew hard against Carl
She began to wonder whether she would not do better to finish her life alone
What was left of life seemed unimportant
II Late in the afternoon of a brilliant October day Alexandra Bergson dressed in a black suit and travelinghat alighted at the Burlington depot in Lincoln
She drove to the Lindell Hotel where she had stayed two years ago when she came up for Emils Commencement
In spite of her usual air of sureness and self possession Alexandra felt ill at ease in hotels and she was glad when she went to the clerks desk to register that there were not many people in the lobby
She had her supper early wearing her hat and black jacket down to the diningroom and carrying her handbag
After supper she went out for a walk
It was growing dark when she reached the university campus
She did not go into the grounds but walked slowly up and down the stone walk outside the long iron fence looking through at the young men who were running from one building to another at the lights shin ing from the armory and the library
A squad of cadets were going through their drill behind the armory and the commands of their young officer rang out at regular intervals so sharp and quick that Alexandra could not understand them
Two stalwart girls came down the library steps and out through one of the iron gates
As they passed her Alexandra was pleased to hear them speaking Bohemian to each other
Every few moments a boy would come running down the flagged walk and dash out into the street as if he were rushing to announce some wonder to the world
Alexandra felt a great tenderness for them all
She wished one of them would stop and speak to her
She wished she could ask them whether they had known Emil
As she lingered by the south gate she actually did encounter one of the boys
He had on his drill cap and was swinging his books at the end of a long strap
It was dark by this time he did not see her and ran against her
He snatched off his cap and stood bareheaded and panting
Im awfully sorry he said in a bright clear voice with a rising inflection as if he expected her to say something
Oh it was my fault
said Alexandra eagerly
Are you an old student here may I ask
No maam
Im a Freshie just off the farm
Cherry County
Were you hunting somebody
No thank you
That is Alexandra wanted to detain him
That is I would like to find some of my brothers friends
He gradu ated two years ago
Then youd have to try the Seniors wouldnt you
Lets see I dont know any of them yet but therell be sure to be some of them around the library
That red building right there he pointed
Thank you Ill try there said Alexandra lingeringly
Oh thats all right
Goodnight
The lad clapped his cap on his head and ran straight down Eleventh Street
Alexandra looked after him wistfully
She walked back to her hotel unreasonably comforted
What a nice voice that boy had and how polite he was
I know Emil was always like that to women
And again after she had undressed and was standing in her nightgown brushing her long heavy hair by the electric light she remembered him and said to herself I dont think I ever heard a nicer voice than that boy had
I hope he will get on well here
Cherry County thats where the hay is so fine and the coyotes can scratch down to water
At nine oclock the next morning Alexandra presented herself at the wardens office in the State Penitentiary
The warden was a Ger man a ruddy cheerfullooking man who had formerly been a harnessmaker
Alexandra had a letter to him from the German banker in Hanover
As he glanced at the letter Mr Schwartz put away his pipe
That big Bohemian is it
Sure hes gettin along fine said Mr Schwartz cheer fully
I am glad to hear that
I was afraid he might be quarrelsome and get himself into more trouble
Mr Schwartz if you have time I would like to tell you a little about Frank Shabata and why I am interested in him
The warden listened genially while she told him briefly something of Franks history and character but he did not seem to find anything unusual in her account
Sure Ill keep an eye on him
Well take care of him all right he said rising
You can talk to him here while I go to see to things in the kitchen
Ill have him sent in
He ought to be done washing out his cell by this time
We have to keep em clean you know
The warden paused at the door speaking back over his shoulder to a pale young man in convicts clothes who was seated at a desk in the corner writing in a big ledger
Bertie when 1037 is brought in you just step out and give this lady a chance to talk
The young man bowed his head and bent over his ledger again
When Mr Schwartz disappeared Alexandra thrust her blackedged handkerchief nervously into her handbag
Coming out on the street car she had not had the least dread of meeting Frank
But since she had been here the sounds and smells in the corridor the look of the men in convicts clothes who passed the glass door of the wardens office affected her unpleasantly
The wardens clock ticked the young con victs pen scratched busily in the big book and his sharp shoulders were shaken every few seconds by a loose cough which he tried to smother
It was easy to see that he was a sick man
Alexandra looked at him timidly but he did not once raise his eyes
He wore a white shirt under his striped jacket a high collar and a necktie very carefully tied
His hands were thin and white and well cared for and he had a seal ring on his little finger
When he heard steps approaching in the corridor he rose blotted his book put his pen in the rack and left the room without raising his eyes
Through the door he opened a guard came in bringing Frank Shabata
You the lady that wanted to talk to 1037
Here he is
Be on your good behavior now
He can set down lady seeing that Alexandra remained standing
Push that white button when youre through with him and Ill come
The guard went out and Alexandra and Frank were left alone
Alexandra tried not to see his hideous clothes
She tried to look straight into his face which she could scarcely believe was his
It was already bleached to a chalky gray
His lips were colorless his fine teeth looked yellowish
He glanced at Alexandra sullenly blinked as if he had come from a dark place and one eye brow twitched continually
She felt at once that this interview was a terrible ordeal to him
His shaved head showing the conformation of his skull gave him a criminal look which he had not had during the trial
Alexandra held out her hand
Frank she said her eyes filling suddenly I hope youll let me be friendly with you
I understand how you did it
I dont feel hard toward you
They were more to blame than you
Frank jerked a dirty blue handkerchief from his trousers pocket
He had begun to cry
He turned away from Alexandra
I never did mean to do noting to dat woman he mut tered
I never mean to do noting to dat boy
I aint had noting agin dat boy
I always like dat boy fine
An then I find him He stopped
The feeling went out of his face and eyes
He dropped into a chair and sat looking stolidly at the floor his hands hanging loosely between his knees the handkerchief lying across his striped leg
He seemed to have stirred up in his mind a disgust that had para lyzed his faculties
I havent come up here to blame you Frank
I think they were more to blame than you
Alexandra too felt benumbed
Frank looked up suddenly and stared out of the office window
I guess dat place all go to hell what I work so hard on he said with a slow bitter smile
I not care a damn
He stopped and rubbed the palm of his hand over the light bristles on his head with annoyance
I no can tink without my hair he com plained
I forget English
We not talk here except swear
Alexandra was bewildered
Frank seemed to have undergone a change of personality
There was scarcely anything by which she could recognize her handsome Bohemian neighbor
He seemed somehow not altogether human
She did not know what to say to him
You do not feel hard to me Frank
she asked at last
Frank clenched his fist and broke out in excitement
I not feel hard at no woman
I tell you I not that kinda man
I never hit my wife
No never I hurt her when she devil me something awful
He struck his fist down on the wardens desk so hard that he afterward stroked it absently
A pale pink crept over his neck and face
Two tree years I know dat woman don care no more bout me Alex andra Bergson
I know she after some other man
I know her oooo
An I aint never hurt her
I never woulda done dat if I aint had dat gun along
I don know what in hell make me take dat gun
She always say I aint no man to carry gun
If she been in dat house where she oughta been But das a foolish talk
Frank rubbed his head and stopped suddenly as he had stopped before
Alexandra felt that there was something strange in the way he chilled off as if something came up in him that extinguished his power of feeling or thinking
Yes Frank she said kindly
I know you never meant to hurt Marie
Frank smiled at her queerly
His eyes filled slowly with tears
You know I most forgit dat womans name
She aint got no name for me no more
I never hate my wife but dat woman what make me do dat Honest to God but I hate her
I no man to fight
I don want to kill no boy and no woman
I not care how many men she take under dat tree
I no care for noting but dat fine boy I kill Alexan dra Bergson
I guess I go crazy sure nough
Alexandra remembered the little yellow cane she had found in Franks clothescloset
She thought of how he had come to this country a gay young fellow so attractive that the pretti est Bohemian girl in Omaha had run away with him
It seemed unreasonable that life should have landed him in such a place as this
She blamed Marie bitterly
And why with her happy affectionate nature should she have brought destruction and sorrow to all who had loved her even to poor old Joe Tovesky the uncle who used to carry her about so proudly when she was a little girl
That was the strangest thing of all
Was there then some thing wrong in being warmhearted and impul sive like that
Alexandra hated to think so
But there was Emil in the Norwegian grave yard at home and here was Frank Shabata
Alexandra rose and took him by the hand
Frank Shabata I am never going to stop trying until I get you pardoned
Ill never give the Governor any peace
I know I can get you out of this place
Frank looked at her distrustfully but he gathered confidence from her face
Alexan dra he said earnestly if I git outa here I not trouble dis country no more
I go back where I come from see my mother
Alexandra tried to withdraw her hand but Frank held on to it nervously
He put out his finger and absently touched a button on her black jacket
Alexandra he said in a low tone looking steadily at the button you ain tink I use dat girl awful bad before No Frank
We wont talk about that Alexandra said pressing his hand
I cant help Emil now so Im going to do what I can for you
You know I dont go away from home often and I came up here on purpose to tell you this
The warden at the glass door looked in in quiringly
Alexandra nodded and he came in and touched the white button on his desk
The guard appeared and with a sinking heart Alexandra saw Frank led away down the cor ridor
After a few words with Mr Schwartz she left the prison and made her way to the streetcar
She had refused with horror the wardens cordial invitation to go through the institution
As the car lurched over its un even roadbed back toward Lincoln Alexandra thought of how she and Frank had been wrecked by the same storm and of how al though she could come out into the sunlight she had not much more left in her life than he
She remembered some lines from a poem she had liked in her schooldays Henceforth the world will only be A wider prisonhouse to me and sighed
A disgust of life weighed upon her heart some such feeling as had twice frozen Frank Shabatas features while they talked together
She wished she were back on the Divide
When Alexandra entered her hotel the clerk held up one finger and beckoned to her
As she approached his desk he handed her a telegram
Alexandra took the yellow envelope and looked at it in perplexity then stepped into the ele vator without opening it
As she walked down the corridor toward her room she reflected that she was in a manner immune from evil tid ings
On reaching her room she locked the door and sitting down on a chair by the dresser opened the telegram
It was from Hanover and it read Arrived Hanover last night
Shall wait here until you come
Please hurry
CARL LINSTRUM
Alexandra put her head down on the dresser and burst into tears
III The next afternoon Carl and Alexandra were walking across the fields from Mrs Hillers
Alexandra had left Lincoln after mid night and Carl had met her at the Hanover station early in the morning
After they reached home Alexandra had gone over to Mrs Hillers to leave a little present she had bought for her in the city
They stayed at the old ladys door but a moment and then came out to spend the rest of the afternoon in the sunny fields
Alexandra had taken off her black traveling suit and put on a white dress partly because she saw that her black clothes made Carl un comfortable and partly because she felt op pressed by them herself
They seemed a little like the prison where she had worn them yester day and to be out of place in the open fields
Carl had changed very little
His cheeks were browner and fuller
He looked less like a tired scholar than when he went away a year ago but no one even now would have taken him for a man of business
His soft lustrous black eyes his whimsical smile would be less against him in the Klondike than on the Divide
There are always dreamers on the frontier
Carl and Alexandra had been talking since morning
Her letter had never reached him
He had first learned of her misfortune from a San Francisco paper four weeks old which he had picked up in a saloon and which con tained a brief account of Frank Shabatas trial
When he put down the paper he had already made up his mind that he could reach Alexandra as quickly as a letter could and ever since he had been on the way day and night by the fastest boats and trains he could catch
His steamer had been held back two days by rough weather
As they came out of Mrs Hillers garden they took up their talk again where they had left it
But could you come away like that Carl without arranging things
Could you just walk off and leave your business
Alexandra asked
Carl laughed
Prudent Alexandra
You see my dear I happen to have an honest partner
I trust him with everything
In fact its been his enterprise from the beginning you know
Im in it only because he took me in
Ill have to go back in the spring
Perhaps you will want to go with me then
We havent turned up millions yet but weve got a start thats worth following
But this winter Id like to spend with you
You wont feel that we ought to wait longer on Emils account will you Alexandra
Alexandra shook her head
No Carl I dont feel that way about it
And surely you neednt mind anything Lou and Oscar say now
They are much angrier with me about Emil now than about you
They say it was all my fault
That I ruined him by sending him to college
No I dont care a button for Lou or Oscar
The moment I knew you were in trou ble the moment I thought you might need me it all looked different
Youve always been a triumphant kind of person
Carl hesitated looking sidewise at her strong full figure
But you do need me now Alex andra
She put her hand on his arm
I needed you terribly when it happened Carl
I cried for you at night
Then everything seemed to get hard inside of me and I thought perhaps I should never care for you again
But when I got your telegram yesterday thenthen it was just as it used to be
You are all I have in the world you know
Carl pressed her hand in silence
They were passing the Shabatas empty house now but they avoided the orchard path and took one that led over by the pasture pond
Can you understand it Carl
Alexandra murmured
I have had nobody but Ivar and Signa to talk to
Do talk to me
Can you un derstand it
Could you have believed that of Marie Tovesky
I would have been cut to pieces little by little before I would have betrayed her trust in me
Carl looked at the shining spot of water before them
Maybe she was cut to pieces too Alexandra
I am sure she tried hard they both did
That was why Emil went to Mexico of course
And he was going away again you tell me though he had only been home three weeks
You remember that Sunday when I went with Emil up to the French Church fair
I thought that day there was some kind of feel ing something unusual between them
I meant to talk to you about it
But on my way back I met Lou and Oscar and got so angry that I forgot everything else
You mustnt be hard on them Alexandra
Sit down here by the pond a minute
I want to tell you something
They sat down on the grasstufted bank and Carl told her how he had seen Emil and Marie out by the pond that morning more than a year ago and how young and charming and full of grace they had seemed to him
It hap pens like that in the world sometimes Alexan dra he added earnestly
Ive seen it before
There are women who spread ruin around them through no fault of theirs just by being too beautiful too full of life and love
They cant help it
People come to them as people go to a warm fire in winter
I used to feel that in her when she was a little girl
Do you remem ber how all the Bohemians crowded round her in the store that day when she gave Emil her candy
You remember those yellow sparks in her eyes
Alexandra sighed
Yes
People couldnt help loving her
Poor Frank does even now I think though hes got himself in such a tangle that for a long time his love has been bitterer than his hate
But if you saw there was any thing wrong you ought to have told me Carl
Carl took her hand and smiled patiently
My dear it was something one felt in the air as you feel the spring coming or a storm in summer
I didnt SEE anything
Simply when I was with those two young things I felt my blood go quicker I felthow shall I say it an acceleration of life
After I got away it was all too delicate too intangible to write about
Alexandra looked at him mournfully
I try to be more liberal about such things than I used to be
I try to realize that we are not all made alike
Only why couldnt it have been Raoul Marcel or Jan Smirka
Why did it have to be my boy
Because he was the best there was I sup pose
They were both the best you had here
The sun was dropping low in the west when the two friends rose and took the path again
The strawstacks were throwing long shadows the owls were flying home to the prairiedog town
When they came to the corner where the pastures joined Alexandras twelve young colts were galloping in a drove over the brow of the hill
Carl said Alexandra I should like to go up there with you in the spring
I havent been on the water since we crossed the ocean when I was a little girl
After we first came out here I used to dream sometimes about the ship yard where father worked and a little sort of inlet full of masts
Alexandra paused
After a moments thought she said But you would never ask me to go away for good would you
Of course not my dearest
I think I know how you feel about this country as well as you do yourself
Carl took her hand in both his own and pressed it tenderly
Yes I still feel that way though Emil is gone
When I was on the train this morning and we got near Hanover I felt something like I did when I drove back with Emil from the river that time in the dry year
I was glad to come back to it
Ive lived here a long time
There is great peace here Carl and freedom



I thought when I came out of that prison where poor Frank is that I should never feel free again
But I do here
Alexandra took a deep breath and looked off into the red west
You belong to the land Carl murmured as you have always said
Now more than ever
Yes now more than ever
You remember what you once said about the graveyard and the old story writing itself over
Only it is we who write it with the best we have
They paused on the last ridge of the pasture overlooking the house and the windmill and the stables that marked the site of John Bergsons homestead
On every side the brown waves of the earth rolled away to meet the sky
Lou and Oscar cant see those things said Alexandra suddenly
Suppose I do will my land to their children what difference will that make
The land belongs to the future Carl thats the way it seems to me
How many of the names on the county clerks plat will be there in fifty years
I might as well try to will the sunset over there to my brothers children
We come and go but the land is always here
And the people who love it and understand it are the people who own itfor a little while
Carl looked at her wonderingly
She was still gazing into the west and in her face there was that exalted serenity that sometimes came to her at moments of deep feeling
The level rays of the sinking sun shone in her clear eyes
Why are you thinking of such things now Alexandra
I had a dream before I went to Lincoln But I will tell you about that afterward after we are married
It will never come true now in the way I thought it might
She took Carls arm and they walked toward the gate
How many times we have walked this path together Carl
How many times we will walk it again
Does it seem to you like coming back to your own place
Do you feel at peace with the world here
I think we shall be very happy
I havent any fears
I think when friends marry they are safe
We dont suffer likethose young ones
Alexandra ended with a sigh
They had reached the gate
Before Carl opened it he drew Alexandra to him and kissed her softly on her lips and on her eyes
She leaned heavily on his shoulder
I am tired she murmured
I have been very lonely Carl
They went into the house together leaving the Divide behind them under the evening star
Fortunate country that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandras into its bosom to give them out again in the yellow wheat in the rustling corn in the shining eyes of youth
