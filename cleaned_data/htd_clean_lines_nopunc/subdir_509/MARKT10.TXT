THE MARKETPLACE by Harold Frederic CHAPTER I THE battle was over and the victor remained on the fieldsitting alone with the hurlyburly of his thoughts
His triumph was so sweeping and comprehensive as to be somewhat shapeless to the view
He had a sense of fascinated pain when he tried to define to himself what its limits would probably be
Vistas of unchecked expanding conquest stretched away in every direction
He held at his mercy everything within sight
Indeed it rested entirely with him to say whether there should be any such thing as mercy at alland until he chose to utter the restraining word the rout of the vanquished would go on with multiplying terrors and ruin
He could crush and torture and despoil his enemies until he was tired
The responsibility of having to decide when he would stop grinding their faces might come to weigh upon him later on but he would not give it room in his mind tonight
A picture of these faces of his victims shaped itself out of the flames in the grate
They were moulded in a family likeness these phantom visages they were all Jewish all malignant all distorted with fright
They implored him with eyes in which panic asserted itself above rage and cunning
Only here and there did he recall a name with which to label one of these countenances very few of them raised a memory of individual rancour
The faces were those of men he had seen no doubt but their persecution of him had been impersonal his great revenge was equally so
As he looked in truth there was only one facea composite mask of what he had done battle with and overthrown and would trample implacably under foot
He stared with a conquerors cold frown at it and gave an abrupt laugh which started harsh echoes in the stillness of the Board Room
Then he shook off the reverie and got to his feet
He shivered a little at the sudden touch of a chill
A bottle of brandy surrounded by glasses stood on the table where the two leastconsidered of his lieutenants the dummy Directors had left it
He poured a small quantity and sipped it
During the whole eventful day it had not occurred to him before to drink the taste of the neat liquor seemed on the instant to calm and refresh his brain
With more deliberation he took a cigar from the broad floridlydecorated open box beside the bottle lit it and blew a long draught of smoke thoughtfully through his nostrils
Then he put his hands in his pockets looked again into the fire and sighed a wondering smile
God in heaven
it was actually true
This man of forty found himself fluttering with a novel exhilaration which yet was not novel
Upon reflection he perceived that he felt as if he were a boy againa boy excited by pleasure
It surprised as much as it delighted him to experience this frank and direct joy of a child
He caught the inkling of an idea that perhaps his years were an illusion
He had latterly been thinking of himself as middleaged the grey hairs thickening at his temples had vaguely depressed him
Now all at once he saw that he was not old at all
The buoyancy of veritable youth bubbled in his veins
He began walking up and down the room regarding new halcyon visions with a sparkling eye
He was no longer conscious of the hated foe beneath his feet they trod instead elastic upon the clouds
The sound of someone moving about in the hallway outside and of trying a door near by suddenly caught his attention
He stood still and listened with alertness for a surprised instant then shrugged his shoulders and began moving again
It must be nearly seven oclock although the allotment work had kept the clerks later than usual that day everybody connected with the offices had certainly gone home
He realized that his nerves had played him a trick in giving that alarmed momentary startand smiled almost tenderly as he remembered how notable and even glorious a warrant those nerves had for their unsettled state
They would be all right after a nights real rest
He would know how to sleep NOW thank God
But yesthere was somebody outsideand this time knocking with assurance at the right door the entrance to the outer office
After a seconds consideration he went into this unlighted outer office and called out through the opaque glass an enquiry
The sound of his voice as it analyzed itself in his own ears seemed unduly peremptory
The answer which came back brought a flash of wonderment to his eyes
He hurriedly unlocked and opened the door
I saw the lights in what I made out to be the Board Room said the newcomer as he entered
I assumed it must be you
Hope I dont interrupt anything
Nothing could have given me greater pleasure Lord Plowden replied the other leading the way back to the inner apartment
In fact I couldnt have asked anything better
The tone of his voice had a certain anxious note in it not quite in harmony with this declaration
He turned under the droplight overhanging the Boardtable and shook hands with his guest as if to atone for this doubtful accent
I shake hands with you again he said speaking rapidly because this afternoon it was what you may call formal it didnt count
Andmy Godyoure the man I owe it all to
Oh you mustnt go as far as thateven in the absence of witnesses replied Lord Plowden lightly
Ill take off my coat for a few minutes he went on very much at his ease
Its hot in here
Its by the merest chance I happened to be detained in the Cityand I saw your lights and this afternoon we had no opportunity whatever for a quiet talk
NoI wont drink anything before dinner but Ill light a cigar
I want to say to you Thorpe he concluded as he seated himself that I think what youve done is very wonderful
The Marquis thinks so toobut I shouldnt like to swear that he understands much about it
The implication that the speaker did understand remained in the air like a tangible object
Thorpe took a chair and the two men exchanged a silent intent look
Their faces dusky red on the side of the glow from the fire pallid where the electric light fell slantwise upon them from above had for a moment a mysterious something in common
Then the tension of the glance was relaxedand on the instant no two men in London looked less alike
Lord Plowden was familiarly spoken of as a handsome man
Thorpe had even heard him called the handsomest man in Englandthough this seemed in all likelihood an exaggeration
But handsome he undoubtedly wastall without suggesting the thought of height to the observer erect yet graceful powerfully built while preserving the effect of slenderness
His face in repose had the outline of the more youthful guardsmantyperegular finelycut impassive to hardness
When he talked or followed with interest the talk of others it revealed almost an excess of animation
Then one noted the flashing subtlety of his glance the swift facility of his smile and comprehending brows and saw that it was not the guardsman face at all
His skin was freshhued and there was a shade of warm brown in his small wellordered moustasche but his hair wavy and worn longer than the fashion seemed black
There were perceptible veins of grey in it though he had only entered his thirtyfifth year
He was dressed habitually with the utmost possible care
The contrast between this personage and the older man confronting him was abrupt
Thorpe was also tall but of a burly and slouching figure
His face shrouded in a highgrowing dustcoloured beard invited no attention
One seemed always to have known this facethickfeatured immobile undistinguished
Its accessories for the time being were even more than ordinarily unimpressive
Both hair and beard were ragged with neglect
His commonplace dark clothes looked as if he had slept in them
The hands resting on his big knees were coarse in shape and roughened and illkept
I couldnt have asked anything better than your dropping in he repeated now speaking with a drag as of caution on his words
Witnesses or no witnesses Im anxious to have you understand that I realize what I owe to you
I only wish it were a great deal more than it is replied the other with a frank smile
Oh itll mount up to considerable as it stands said Thorpe
He could hear that there was a kind of reservation in his voice the suspicion that his companion detected it embarrassed him
He found himself in the position of fencing with a man to whom all his feelings impelled him to be perfectly open
He paused and was awkwardly conscious of constraint in the silence which ensued
You are very kind to put it in that way said Lord Plowden at last
He seemed also to be finding words for his thoughts with a certain difficulty
He turned his cigar round in his white fingers meditatively
I gather that your success has been completeas complete as you yourself could have desired
I congratulate you with all my heart
Nodont say my successsay our success put in Thorpe
But my dear man the other corrected him my interest compared with yours is hardly more than nominal
Im a Director of course and Im not displeased that my few shares should be worth something instead of nothing but Thorpe lifted one of his heavy hands
That isnt my view of the thing at all
To be frank I was turning over in my mind just awhile ago before you came in some way of arranging all that on a different footing
If youll trust it to me I think youll find its all right
Something in the form of this remark seemed to restore to Lord Plowden his accustomed fluency of speech
I came here to say precisely that thing he beganthat I do trust it to you
We have never had any very definite talk on the subjectand pray dont think that I want to go into details now
Id much rather not in fact
But what I do want to say to you is this I believe in you
I feel sure that you are going to go far as the saying is
Well I want to tie myself to your star
Do you see what I mean
You are going to be a power in finance
You are going to be able to make and unmake men as you choose
I should be very much obliged indeed if you would make me
Thorpe regarded the handsome and titled man of fashion with what seemed to the other a lethargic gaze
In truth his mind was toiling with strenuous activity to master in all its bearings the significance of what had been said
This habit of the abstracted and lacklustre eye the while he was hard at work thinking was a fortuitous asset which he had never up to that time learned that he possessed
Unconsciously he dampened the spirits of his companion
Dont imagine Im trying to force myself upon you Lord Plowden said growing cool in the face of this slow stare
Im asking nothing at all
I had the impulse to come and say to you that you are a great man and that youve done a great thingand done it moreover in a very great way
You know how it was done
The wondering exclamation forced itself from Thorpes unready lips
He bent forward a little and took a new visual hold as it were of his companions countenance
Lord Plowden smiled
Did you think I was such a hopeless duffer then
he rejoined
For answer Thorpe leant back in his chair crossed his legs and patted his knee contentedly
All at once his face had lightened a genial speculation returned to his grey eyes
Well I was in a curious position about you you see he began to explain
The relief with which he spoke was palpable
I could not for the life of me make up my mind whether to tell you about it or not
Lets seethis is Thursday did I see you Tuesday
At any rate the scheme didnt dawn on me myself until toward evening Tuesday
But yesterday of course I could have told youand again this afternoonbut as I say I couldnt make up my mind
Once I had it on the tip of my tonguebut somehow I didnt
And youyou never gave me a hint that you saw what was going on
Again Lord Plowden smiled
I voted with you he put in softly
Thorpe laughed and relit his cigar
Well I couldnt have asked anything better than this he declared once again
It beats all the rest put together to my mind
Perhaps I dont quite follow your meaning commented the other tentatively
Why man Thorpe explained hesitating a little in his choice of words but speaking with evident fervour I was more anxious about youand the way youd take it than about anything else
I give you my word I was
I couldnt tell at all how youd feel about the thing
You might think that it was all right and then again you might round on meor no I dont mean quite that but you might say it wasnt good enough for you and wash your hands of the whole affair
And I cant tell you what a relief it is to find that youthat youre satisfied
Now I can go ahead
Ah yesahead said the younger man thoughtfully
Do you mind telling meyou see Im quite in the dark as to detailshow much further ahead we are likely to go
I comprehend the general nature of our advance but how far off is the goal you have in sight
God knows
answered Thorpe with a rising thrill of excitement in his voice
I dont give it any limit
I dont see why we should stop at all
Weve got them in such a position thatwhy good heavens
we can squeeze them to death crush them like quartz
He chuckled grimly at the suggestion of his simile
Well get more ounces to the ton out of our crushings than they ever heard of on the Rand too
Might I ask interposed the other who may they be
Thorpe hesitated and knitted his brows in the effort to remember names
Oh there are a lot of them he said vaguely
I think I told you of the way that Kaffir crowd pretended to think well of me and let me believe they were going to take me up and then because I wouldnt give them everythingthe very shirt off my backturned and put their knife into me
I dont know them apart hardlytheyve all got names like Rhine winesbut I know the gang as a whole and if I dont lift the roof clean off their particular synagogue then my name is mud
Lord Plowden smiled
Ive always the greatest difficulty to remember that you are an Englishmana Londoner born he declared pleasantly
You dont talk in the least like one
On shipboard I made sure you were an Americana very characteristic one I thoughtof some curious Western variety you know
I never was more surprised in my life than when you told me the other day that you only left England a few years ago
Oh hardly a few years more like fifteen Thorpe corrected him
He studied his companions face with slow deliberation
Im going to say something that you mustnt take amiss he remarked after a little pause
If youd known that I was an Englishman when we first met there on the steamer I kind o suspect that you and Id never have got much beyond a nodding acquaintanceand even that mostly on my side
I dont mean that I intended to conceal anythingthat is not speciallybut Ive often thought since that it was a mighty good thing I did
Now isnt that truethat if you had taken me for one of your own countrymen youd have given me the cold shoulder
I dare say theres a good deal in what you say the other admitted gently enough but without contrition
Things naturally shape themselves that way rather you know
If they didnt why then the whole position would become difficult
But you are an American to all intents and purposes
Oh noI never took any step towards getting naturalized Thorpe protested
I always intended to come back here
Or no I wont say thatbecause most of the time I was dogpoorand this isnt the place for a poor man
But I always said to myself that if ever I pulled it offif I ever found my self a rich manTHEN Id come piking across the Atlantic as fast as tripleexpansion engines would carry me
The young man smiled again with a whimsical gleam in his eye
And you ARE a rich man now he observed after a momentary pause
We are both rich men replied Thorpe gravely
He held up a dissuading hand as the other would have spoken
This is how it seems to me the thing figures itself out It cant be said that your name on the Board or the Marquiss either was of much use so far as the public were concerned
To tell the truth I saw some time ago that they wouldnt be
Titles on prospectuses are played out in London
Ive rather a notion indeed that theyre apt to do more harm than goodjust at present at least
But all that asideyou are the man who was civil to me at the start when you knew nothing whatever about my scheme and you are the man who was good to me later on when I didnt know where to turn for a friendly word
Very well here I am
Ive made my coup
And Id be a sweep wouldnt I
to forget today what I was so glad to remember a week ago
But you see I dont forget
The capital of the Company is 500000 pounds all in pound shares
We offered the public only a fifth of them
The other four hundred thousand shares are mine as vendorand I have earmarked in my mind one hundred thousand of them to be yours
Lord Plowdens face paled at the significance of these words
It is too muchyou dont reflect what it is you are saying he murmured confusedly
Not a bit of it the other reassured him
Everything that Ive said goes
The peer trembling a little rose to his feet
It is a preposterously big reward for the merest act of courtesy he insisted
Of course it takes my breath away for joyand yet I feel I oughtnt to be consenting to it at all
And it has its unpleasant sideit buries me under a mountain of obligation
I dont know what to do or what to say
Well leave the saying and doing to me then replied Thorpe with a gesture before which the other resumed his seat
Just a word moreand then I suppose wed better be going
Look at it in this way
Your grandfather was Lord Chancellor of England and your father was a General in the Crimea
My grandfather kept a small secondhand bookshop and my father followed him in the business
In one sense that puts us ten thousand miles apart
But in another sense well say that we like each other and that there are ways in which we can be of immense use to each other and that brings us close together
You need moneyand here it is for you
I needwhat shall I saya kind of friendly lead in the matter of establishing myself on the right footing among the right peopleand thats what you can do for me
MindId prefer to put it all in quite another way Id like to say it was all niceness on your part all gratitude on mine
But if you want to consider it on a business basiswhy there you have it alsoperfectly plain and clear
He got up as he finished and Lord Plowden rose as well
The two men shook hands in silence
When the latter spoke it was to say Do you know how to open one of those sodawater bottles
Ive tried but I can never get the trick
I think I should like to have a drinkafter this
When they had put down their glasses and the younger man was getting into his greatcoat Thorpe bestowed the brandy and cigars within a cabinet at the corner of the room and carefully turned a key upon them
If youre going West let me give you a lift said Lord Plowden hat in hand
I can set you down wherever you like
Unfortunately Ive to go out to dinner and I must race as it is to get dressed
Thorpe shook his head
No go along he bade him
Ive some odds and ends of things to do on the way
Then when shall I see you
began the other and halted suddenly with a new thought in his glance
But what are you doing Saturday
he asked in a brisker tone
Its a dies non here
Come down with me tomorrow evening to my place in Kent
We will shoot on Saturday and drive about on Sunday if you likeand there we can talk at our leisure
Yes that is what you must do
I have a gun for you
Shall we say thenCharing Cross at 955
Or better still say 515 and we will dine at home
The elder man pondered his answerfrowning at the problem before him with visible anxiety
Im afraid Id better not comeits very good of you all the same
Nonsense retorted the other
My mother will be very glad indeed to see you
There is no one else thereunless perhaps my sister has some friend down
We shall make a purely family party
Thorpe hesitated for only a further second
All right
Charing Cross 515 he said then with the grave brevity of one who announces a momentous decision
He stood still looking into the fire for a few moments after his companion had gone
Then going to a closet at the end of the room he brought forth his coat and hat something prompted him to hold them up and scrutinize them under the bright light of the electric globe
He put them on then with a smile halfscornful halfamused playing in his beard
The touch of a button precipitated darkness upon the Board Room
He made his way out and downstairs to the street
It was a rainy windy October night sloppy underfoot dripping overhead
At the corner before him a cabman motionless under his unshapely covered hat and glistening rubber cape sat perched aloft on his seat apparently asleep
Thorpe hailed him with a peremptory tone and gave the brusque order Strand
as he clambered into the hansom
CHAPTER II LOUISA the long and short of it is this said Thorpe half an hour later you never did believe in me as a sister should do
He was seated alone with this sister in a small low rather dismallyappointed room halfheartedly lighted by two flickering gasjets
They sat somewhat apart confronting a fireplace where only the laid materials for a fire disclosed themselves in the cold grate
Above the mantel hung an enlarged photograph of a scowling old man
Thorpes gaze recurred automatically at brief intervals to this portraitwhich somehow produced the effect upon him of responsibility for the cheerlessness of the room
There were other pictures on the walls of which he was dimly conscioussmall faded old prints about Dido and AEneas and Agamemnon which seemed to be coming back to him out of the mists of his childhood
Vagrant impressions and associations of this childhood strayed with quaint inconsequence across the field of his preoccupied mind
The peculiar odour of the ancient bookshop on the floor below remained like snuff in his nostrils
Somewhere underneath or in the wainscoting at the side he could hear the assiduous gnawing of a rat
Was it the same rat he wondered with a mental grin that used to keep him awake nights in one of the rooms next to this with that same foolish noise when he was a boy
I know you always say that replied Louisa impassively
She was years older than her brother but without a trace of artifice or intention contrived to look the younger of the two
Her thick hair drawn simply from her temples into a knot behind was of that palest brown which assimilates grey
Her face long plain masculine in contour and spirit conveyed no message as to years
Long and spare of figure she sat upright in her straightbacked chair with her large capable hands on her knees
I believed in you as much as youd let me she went on indifferently almost wearily
But I dont see that it mattered to you whether I did or didnt
You went your own way you did what you wanted to do
What had I to do with it
I dont suppose I even knew what part of the world you were in more than once in two or three years
How should I know whether you were going to succeed when I didnt even know what it was you were at
Certainly you hadnt succeeded here in Londonbut elsewhere you might or you might nothow could I tell
And moreover I dont feel that I know you very well youve grown into something very different from the boy Joel that left the shopit must be twenty years ago
I can only know about you and your affairs what you tell me
But my point is pursued Thorpe watching her face with a curiously intent glance you never said to yourself I KNOW hes going to succeed
I KNOW hell be a rich man before he dies
She shook her head dispassionately
Her manner expressed fatigued failure to comprehend why he was making so much of this purposeless point
NoI dont remember ever having said that to myself she admitted listlessly
Then a comment upon his words occurred to her and she spoke with more animation You dont seem to understand Joel that what was very important to you didnt occupy me at all
You were always talking about getting rich you kept the idea before you of sometime at a stroke finding yourself a millionaire
Thats been the idea of your life
But what do I know about all that
My work has been to keep a roof over my headto keep the little business from disappearing altogether
Its been hard enough I can tell you these last few years with the big jobbers cutting the hearts out of the small traders
I had the invalid husband to support for between three and four yearsa dead weight on me every weekand then the children to look after to clothe and educate
At the last word she hesitated suddenly and looked at him
Dont think Im ungratefulshe went on with a troubled effort at a smilebut I almost wish youd never sent me that four hundred pounds at all
What it means is that theyve had two years at schools where now I shant be able to keep them any longer
Theyll be spoiled for my kind of lifeand they wont have a fair chance for any other
I dont know what will become of them
The profound apprehension in the mothers voice did not dull the gleam in Thorpes eyes
He even began a smile in the shadows of his unkempt moustache
But when I sent that money for example two years ago and over he persisted doggedlyand I told you thered be more where that came from and that I stood to pull off the great eventeven then now you didnt believe in your innermost heart that I knew what I was talking about did you
She frowned with impatience as she turned toward him
For heavens sake Joel she said sharplyyou become a bore with that stupid nonsense
I want to be patient with youI do indeed sympathize with you in your misfortunesyou know that well enoughbut youre very tiresome with that eternal harping on what I believed and what I didnt believe
Now are you going to stop to supper or notbecause if you are I must send the maid out
And theres another thingwould it be of any help to you to bring your things here from the hotel
You can have Alfreds room as well as nottill Christmas at least
Supposing I couldnt get my luggage out of the hotel till Id settled my bill suggested Thorpe tentatively in a muffled voice
The practical woman reflected for an instant
I was thinking she confessed then that it might be cheaper to leave your things there and buy what little you wantI dont imagine from what Ive seen that your wardrobe is so very valuablebut no I suppose the bill ought to be paid
Perhaps it can be managed how much will it be
Thorpe musingly rose to his feet and strolled over to her chair
With his thick hands on his sisters shoulders he stooped and kissed her on the forehead
You believe in me now anyway eh Lou
he said as he straightened himself behind her
The unaccustomed caressso different in character from the perfunctory salute with which he had greeted her on his arrival from foreign parts six months before brought a flush of pleased surprise to her plain face
Then a kind of bewilderment crept into the abstracted gaze she was bending upon the fireless grate
Something extraordinary unaccountable was in the manner of her brother
She recalled that in truth he was more than half a stranger to her
How could she tell what wild uncanny second nature had not grown up in him under those outlandish tropical skies
He had just told her that his ruin was absoluteoverwhelmingyet there had been a covert smile in the recesses of his glance
Even now she half felt half heard a chuckle from him there as he stood behind her
The swift thought that disaster had shaken his brain loomed up and possessed her
She flung herself out of the chair and wheeling seized its back and drew it between them as she faced him
It was with a stare of frank dismay that she beheld him grinning at her
Whatshe began stammeringWhat is the matter Joel
He permitted himself the luxury of smiling blankly at her for a further moment
Then he tossed his head and laughed abruptly
Sit down old girl he adjured her
Try and hold yourself together nowto hear some different kind of news
Ive been playing it rather low down on you for a fact
Instead of my being smashed its the other way about
She continued to confront him with a nervous clasp upon the chairback
Her breathing troubled her as she regarded him and tried to take in the meaning of his words
Do you meanyouve been lying to me aboutabout your Company
she asked confusedly
Nononot at all he replied now all genial heartiness
Nowhat I told you was gospel truthbut I was taking a rise out of you all the same
He seemed so unaffectedly pleased by his achievement in kindly duplicity that she forced an awkward smile to her lips
I dont understand in the least she said striving to remember what he had told her
What you said was that the public had entirely failed to come inthat there werent enough applications for shares to pay flotation expensesthose were your own words
Of course I dont pretend to understand these City mattersbut it IS the case isnt it that if people dont subscribe for the shares of a new company then the company is a failure
Yes that may be said to be the caseas a general rule he nodded at her still beaming
Well thenof courseI dont understand she owned
I dont know as youll understand it much more when Ive explained it to you he said seating himself and motioning her to the other chair
But yes of course you will
Youre a business woman
You know what figures mean
And really the whole thing is as simple as A B C You remember that I told you But are you going to stop to supper
I must send Annie out before the shops close
Supper
NoI couldnt eat anything
Im too worked up for that
Ill get something at the hotel before I go to bed if I feel like it
But say
the thought suddenly struck himif you want to come out with me Ill blow you off to the swaggerest dinner in London
What dye say
She shook her head
I shall have some bread and cheese and beer at nine
Thats my rule you know
I dont like to break it
Im always queer next day if I do
But now make haste and tell meyoure really not broken then
You have really come out well
For answer he rose and drew himself to his full height and spread his bulky shoulders backward
His greyblue eyes looked down upon her with a triumphant glow
Broken
he echoed her word with emphasis
My dear Louisa Im not the sort that gets broken
I break other people
Oh God how I shall break them
He began pacing up and down on the narrow rug before the fender excitedly telling his story to her
Sometimes he threw the words over his shoulder again he held her absorbed gaze with his
He took his hands often from his pockets to illustrate or enforce by gestures the meaning of his speechand then she found it peculiarly difficult to realize that he was her brother
Much of the narrative rambling and disconnected with which he prefaced this story of the day was vaguely familiar to her
He sketched now for her in summary and with the sonorous voice of one deeply impressed with the dramatic values of his declamation the chronicle of his wanderings in strange landsand these he had frequently told her about before
Soon she perceived however that he was stringing them together on a new thread
One after another these experiences of his as he related them turned upon the obstacles and fatal pitfalls which treachery and malice had put in his path
He seemed by his account to have been a hundred times almost within touch of the goal
In China in the Dutch Indies in those remoter parts of Australia which were a waterless waste when he knew them and might have owned them and now were yielding fabulous millions to fellows who had tricked and swindled himeverywhere he had missed by just a hairs breadth the golden consummation
In the Western hemisphere the tale repeated itself
There had been times in the Argentine in Brazil just before the Empire fell in Colorado when the Silver boom was on in British Columbia when the first rumours of rich ore were whispered aboutmany times when fortune seemed veritably within his grasp
But someone had always played him false
There was never a friendship for him which could withstand the temptation of profitable treason
But he had hung dauntlessly on
He had seen one concession slipping through his fingers only to strain and tighten them for a clutch at another
It did not surprise his hearernor indeed did it particularly attract her attentionthat there was nowhere in this rapid and comprehensive narrative any allusion to industry of the wageearning sort
Apparently he had done no work at all in the breadwinners sense of the word
This was so like Joel that it was taken for granted in his sisters mind
All his voyages and adventures and painful enterprises had been informed by the desire of the buccaneerthe passion to reap where others had sown or at the worst to get something for nothing
The discursive story began to narrow and concentrate itself when at last it reached Mexico
The sister changed her position in her chair and crossed her knees when Tehuantepec was mentioned
It was from that place that Joel had sent her the amazing remittance over two years ago
Curiously enough though it was at this point in his narrative that he now became vague as to details
There were concessions of rubber forests mentioned and the barter of these for other concessions with money to boot and varying phases of a chronic trouble about where the true boundary of Guatemala ranbut she failed clearly to understand much about it all
His other schemes and mishaps she had followed readily enough
Somehow when they came to Mexico however she saw everything jumbled and distorted as through a haze
Once or twice she interrupted him to ask questions but he seemed to attach such slight importance to her comprehending these details that she forbore
Only one fact was it necessary to grasp about the Mexican episode apparently
When he quitted Tehuantepec to make his way straight to London at the beginning of the year he left behind him a rubber plantation which he desired to sell and brought with him between six and seven thousand pounds with which to pay the expenses of selling it
How he had obtained either the plantation or the money did not seem to have made itself understood
No doubt as his manner indicated when she ventured her enquiries it was quite irrelevant to the narrative
In Mexico his experience had been unique apparently in that no villain had appeared on the scene to frustrate his plans
He at least mentioned no one who had wronged him there
When he came to London however there were villains and to spare
He moved to the mantel when he arrived at this stage of the story and made clear a space for his elbow to rest among the little trinkets and photographs with which it was burdened
He stood still thereafter looking down at her his voice took on a harsher note
Much of this story also she knew by heart
This strange bearded greyishhaired brother of hers had come very often during the past halfyear to the little bookshop and the widows home above it his misshapen handbag full of papers his heart full of rage hope grief ambition disgust confidenceeverything but despair
It was true it had never been quite real to her
He was right in his suggestion that she had never wholly believed in him
She had not been able to take altogether seriously this clumsy careworn shabbilydressed man who talked about millions
It was true that he had sent her four hundred pounds for the education of her son and daughter it was equally true that he had brought with him to London a sum which any of his ancestors so far as she knew about them would have deemed a fortune and which he treated as merely so much oil with which to lubricate the machinery of his great enterprise
She had heard at various times the embittered details of the disappearance of this money little by little
Nearly a quarter of it all told had been appropriated by a sleek old braggart of a companypromoter who had cozened Joel into the belief that London could be best approached through him
When at last this wretch was kicked downstairs the effect had been only to make room for a fresh lot of bloodsuckers
There were socalled advertising agents socalled journalists socalled men of influence in the Citya swarm of relentless and voracious harpies who dragged from him in blackmail nearly the half of what he had left before he summoned the courage and decision to shut them out
Worse still in some ways were the men into whose hands he stumbled nexta group of City men concerned in the South African market who impressed him very favourably at the outset
He got to know them by accident and at the time when he began to comprehend the necessity of securing influential support for his scheme
Everything that he heard and could learn about them testified to the strength of their position in the City
Because they displayed a certain amiability of manner toward him and his project he allowed himself to make sure of their support
It grew to be a certainty in his mind that they would see him through
He spent a good deal of money in dinners and suppers in their honour after they had let him understand that this form of propitiation was not unpleasant to them
They chaffed him about some newspaper paragraphs in which he was described as the Rubber King with an affable assumption of amusement under which he believed that he detected a genuine respect for his abilities
Finally when he had danced attendance upon them for the better part of two months he laid before them at the coffeeandcigars stage of a dinner in a private room of the Savoy the details of his proposition
They were to form a Syndicate to take over his property and place it upon the market in consideration of their finding the ready money for this exploitation they were to have for themselves twofifths of the shares in the Company ultimately to be floated
They listened to these details and to his enthusiastic remarks about the project itself with rather perfunctory patience but committed themselves that evening to nothing definite
It took him nearly a week thereafter to get an answer from any of them
Then he learned that if they took the matter up at all it would be upon the basis of the Syndicate receiving ninetenths of the shares
He conceived the idea after he had mastered his original amazement that they named these preposterous terms merely because they expected to be beaten down and he summoned all his good nature and tact for the task of haggling with them
He misunderstood their first show of impatience at this and persevered in the face of their tacit rebuffs
Then one day a couple of them treated him with overt rudeness and he astonished out of his caution replied to them in kind
Suddenly he could hardly tell why or how they were all enemies of his
They closed their office doors to him even their clerks treated him with contemptuous incivility
This blow to his pride enraged and humiliated him curiously enough as no other misadventure of his life had done
Louisa remembered vividly the description he had given to her at the time of this affair
She had hardly understood why it should disturb him so profoundly to her mind these men had done nothing so monstrous after all
But to him their offense swallowed up all the other indignities suffered during the years of his Ishmaelitish wanderings
A sombre lust for vengeance upon them took root in his very soul
He hated nobody else as he hated them
How often she had heard him swear in solemn vibrating tones that to the day of his death his most sacred ambition should be their punishment their abasement in the dust and mire
And now all at once as she looked up at him where he leant against the mantel these vagabond memories of hers took point and shape
It was about these very men that he was talking
And think of it
he was saying impressively
Its magnificent enough for me to make this great hitbut I dont count it as anything at all by comparison with the fact that I make it at their expense
You remember the fellows I told you about
he asked abruptly deferring to the confused look on her face
Yesyou make it out of them she repeated in an uncertain voice
It occurred to her that she must have been almost asleep
But did I miss anything
Have you been telling what it is that you have made
Nothat you shall have in good time
You dont seem to realize it Louisa
I can hardly realize it myself
I am actually a very rich man
I cant tell how much Ive gotin fact it can be almost as much as I like half a million pounds I suppose at the start if I want to make it that much
Yesit takes the breath away doesnt it
But best of alla thousand times best of allpractically every dollar of it comes out of those Kaffir swinethe very men that tried to rob me and that have been trying to ruin me ever since
I tell you what I wish LouiseI wish to God there could only be time enough and Id take it all in halfsovereignstwo millions of them or three millionsand just untwist every coin one by one out from among their heartstrings
Ohbut itll be all right as it is
Its enough to make a man feel religiousto think how those thieves are going to suffer
Well  she said slowly after reflection it all rather frightens me
As if the chill in the air of the cheerless room had suddenly accentuated itself she arose took a match box from the mantel and stooping lit the fire
He looked down at the tall blackclad figure bent in stiff awkwardness over the smoking grate and his eyes softened
Then he took fresh note of the roomthe faded threadbare carpet the sparse old furniture that had seemed ugly to even his uninformed boyish taste the dingy walls and begrimed low ceilingall pathetic symbols of the bleak life to which she had been condemned
Frightens you
he queried with a kind of jovial tenderness as she got to her feet frightens you eh
Why within a months time old lady youll be riding in the Park in your own carriage with niggers folding their arms up behind and youll be taking it all as easy and as natural as if youd been born in a barouche
He added in response to the enquiry of her lifted brows Barouche
Thats what wed call in England a landau
She stood with a foot upon the fender her tired passive face inclined meditatively her rusty old black gown drawn back by one hand from the snapping sparks
No she said slowly joyless resignation mingling with pride in her voice
I was born here over the shop
Well good God
so was I he commented lustily
But thats no reason why I shouldnt wind up in Park Laneor you either
She had nothing to say to this apparently
After a little she seated herself again drawing her chair closer to the hearth
Its years since Ive lit this fire before the first of November she remarked with the air of defending the action to herself
Oh were celebrating he said rubbing his hands over the reluctant blaze
Everything goes tonight
Her face as she looked up at him betrayed the bewilderment of her mind
You set out to tell me what it was all about she reminded him
You see Im completely in the dark
I only hear you say that youve made a great fortune
Thats all I know
Or perhaps youve told me as much as you care to
Why not at all he reassured her pulling his own chair toward him with his foot and sprawling into it with a grunt of relief
If youll draw me a glass of that beer of yours Ill tell you all about it
Its not a thing for everybody to know not to be breathed to a human being for that matterbut youll enjoy it and itll be safe enough with you
As she rose and moved toward a door he called merrily after her No more beer when that keg runs dry you know
Nothing but champagne
CHAPTER III THORPE took a long thoughtful pull at the beer his sister brought him
Ah I didnt know I was so thirsty he said when he put the glass down
Truth isIve lost track of myself altogether sincesince the big thing happened
I seem to be somebody elsea comparative stranger so to speak
Ive got to get acquainted with myself all over again
You cant imagine what an extraordinary feeling it isthis being hit every few minutes with the recollection that youre worth half a million
Its like being struck over the head
It knocks you down
There are such thousands of things to doyou dance about all of a flutter
You dont know where to begin
Begin where you left off suggested Louisa
You were going to tell me howhow the big thing happened
Youre always coming to itand never getting any further
Nodding comprehension of the rebukes justification he plunged forthwith into the tale
You remember my telling you at the time how I got my Board together
Im speaking now of the present Companyafter Id decided to be my own promoter and have at least some kind of a lookin for my money
There wasnt much money left by the way it was considerably under three thousand
But I come to that later
First there was the Board
Here was where that Lord Plowden that I told you aboutthe man that came over on the ship with mecame in
I went to him
IGod
I was desperatebut I hadnt much of an idea hed consent
But he did
He listened to me and I told him how Id been robbed and how the Syndicate would have cut my throat if I hadnt pulled awayand he said Why yes Ill go on your Board
Then I told him more about it and presently he said hed get me another man of titlea skyscraper of a title tooto be my Chairman
Thats the Marquis of Chaldon a tremendous diplomatic swell you know Ambassador at Vienna in his time and Lord Lieutenant and all sorts of things but willing to gather in his five hundred a year all the same
Do you mean that YOU pay HIM five hundred pounds a year
asked the sister
Yes Ive got a live Markiss who works for me at ten quid a week and a few extras
The other Directors get three hundred
This Lord Plowden is one of thembut Ill tell you more about him later on
Then theres Watkin hes a small accountant Finsbury way and Davidson hes a winemerchant who used to belong to a big firm in Dundee but gets along the best way he can on a very dicky business here in London now
And then theres General Kervick awfully wellconnected old chap they say but I guess he needs all he can get
Hes started wearing his furcoat already
Well thats my Board
I couldnt join it of course till after allotmentthats because Im the vendor as they call itbut that hasnt interfered at all with my running the whole show
The Board doesnt really count you know
It only does what I want it to do
Its just a form that costs me seventeen hundred a year thats all
Seventeen hundred a year she repeated mechanically
Well then we got out the prospectus dye see
Or first there were other things to be done
I saw that a good brokers name counted for a lot on a prospectus
I picked out one that Id heard was reasonableitd been a splendid name if I could have got itbut he calmly said his price was two thousand pounds all cash downand I came away
Finally I got a fellow who hadnt done much of anything yet and so wasnt so stiff about his figure
He agreed to take 500 pounds cash and 2000 in shares
It was Gods luck that I hit on him for he turned out at the pinch to be the one man in a million for me
But Ill tell you about him later
Hes the Broker mind you mustnt forget him
Well then he and I got a Solicitorhe took 200 pounds cash but he had to have 2000 sharesand the firm of Auditorsthey were 100 pounds cash and 1000 shares
Every company has to have these people pasted on to it by law
Oh yes and then you must have your Bankers
You dont pay them anything though thank God
Well then there was the machinery complete all ready to start
I took a handsome set of offices and furnished them up to the ninesbut that I was able to do pretty well on credit
You see ready money was getting short
And now came the biggest pull of all
There was the press to be worked
He spoke as if there were no other papers in London but the financial journals
I didnt sleep much while that was being fixed up
Youve got no more idea of what the press means Louisa than you have ofof a coil of snakes thawing out hungry in the spring
Why if one blackmailer came to me I swear a hundred did
They scared the life out of me the first month or so
And then theres a swarm of advertising agents who say they can keep these blackmailers off if youll make it worth their while
But they all wanted too much money for meand for a while I was at my wits ends
At last I got a fellowhes not behaved so badly all things consideredwho had some sporting blood in his veins and he was willing to do the whole thing for 5000 pounds if I could pay 1500 pounds down and the rest in shares
But that was just what I couldnt do you see so finally he took 1000 pounds down and 5000 in sharesand as I say hes done it tolerably well
There was one editor that I had to square personallythat is to say 100 pounds cashit had to be in sovereigns for notes could be tracedand a call of 2000 shares at parhes the boss pirate that everybody has to squareand of course there were odd tenpound notes here and there but as a rule I just opened the door and fired the blackmailers out
The moment a fellow came in and handed me his card and said he had proofs of two kinds of articles in his pocket one praising me one damning me I told him to go and see my advertising agent and if he wouldnt do that then to go to hell
Thats the way youve got to talk in the City he added as if in apologetic explanation
Louisa looked impassively at her brother
Oh Ive heard the expression as far west as the Strand she remarked
Well then came the issue
That was last Saturday
You saw the prospectus in Saturday mornings papers and in the weeklies
The list was to be kept open it said till Wednesday morningthat was yesterday
That is to say during all that time people could apply for shares
Which they didnt doaccording to your account the sister suggested dryly
Thorpe passed his fingers through his roughened hair and eyed her with a momentary quizzical gleam in his eye
Then he became serious again
The recollection of what he was now to narrate brought a frown to his brows
On Tuesday afternoon he began with portentous deliberationOr no first I must explain something
You see in bringing out a company you cant put up too stout a bluff
I mean youve got to behave as if you were rolling in wealthas if everything was coming your way and fortunes were to be made by fastening to you
I dont know that it often fools anybody very much but its part of the game and you must play it
Well accordingly my Broker goes on change Saturday morning and has his jobber shout out that hell buy Rubber Consolsthats what our shares are called on the streetat an eighth premium that is to say he offered to buy for twentytwoandsix what we were offering to the public for twenty shillings
Of course you see the object of that was to create the impression that there was a regular Godalmighty rush for our shares
As I say I dont know whether that ever fooled anybodybut at least there was the chance that it might start up some dealing in the sharesand all those things help
Besides you got the sales noticed in the papers and that might start up applications from the public
Well the Broker bought 1000 shares this way on Saturday
On Monday when it might still be possible to change the luck he bought 3500 more still at that premium of an eighth
He bought some Tuesday morning toosay 4000
Well now keep those figures in your head and keep an eye on the Broker
Hes worth watchingas youll see
Whats his name
asked the sister with an accession of alertness in her face
You call him Brokerand that doesnt mean anything to me
Theyre all brokers arent they
SempleColin Semple thats his name
Hes a young Scotchmanfathers a Presbyterian minister
Hes a little insignificant runt of a chap to look atbut I learned a long time ago not to judge a singed cat by his looks
Howeverwhere was I
You were going to tell about Tuesday afternoon werent you
He nodded gravely and straightened himself drawing a long breath in preparation for the dramatic recital before him
On Tuesday afternoon he began again with impressive slowness I was walking on Throgmorton Street about four oclock
It was raining a littleit had been raining on and off all daya miserable rotten sort of a day with greasy mud everywhere and everybody poking umbrellas into you
I was out walking because Id a cut my throat if Id tried to stay in the office another ten minutes
All that day I hadnt eaten anything
I hadnt slept worth speaking of for three nights
The whole game was up for me
I was worse than ruined
I had half a crown in my pocket
I had ten or twelve pounds in the bankand they wouldnt let me overdraw a farthing
I tell you I was just plumb busted
There came along in the gutter a sandwichman
Id seen the cuss before during the day walking up and down near my offices
I took notice of him because he was the raggedest dirtiest most forlornlooking cripple you ever saw in your life
Now I read what was on his boards
It was the bill of a paper that I had refused to be bled by and there it was in big letters The Rubber Bubble Burst
Thorpes Audacity Punished
Those were the words
I can see them with my eyes shut
I stood there looking at the fellow and I suppose there was something in the way I looked for he stopped too
Of course he didnt know me from Adam but all the same Im damned if he didnt wink his eye at meas if we two had a joke between us
And at that I burst out laughingI simply roared with laughter like a boy at a pantomimeand I took that last halfcrown out of my pocket and I gave it to the sandwichman
God
you should have seen his face
I dont particularly mind Joel said his sister but I never heard you swear so much before
Oh what thewhat the deuce
he protested impatiently
Dont interrupt me now
Well I went on down the street
The members of the Stock Exchange were coming out of the house and making up little groups on the pavement
They do business inside you know until closing timethis day it happened to be four oclockand then they come out and deal in the street with one another with the kerbstone mob who are not allowed inside standing round to watch the thing
I came along into the thick of these fellows they were yelling out all sorts of thingsEast Rands Oroyas Lake View Centrals and what not but these went in one ear and out the other
If there ever was a man with no stomach for the market it was me
But then someone roared out At seveneighths sell Rubber Consols
Sell five hundred Rubber at seveneighths
Sell five hundred at threequarters
At threequarters you have em
Rubber Consols
Sell a thou
at threequarters
This thing went into my brain like a live coal
I stopped and looked up at the fellowand by God it was one of the men Ive been talking aboutone of those Kaffir scoundrels
I wish I was better at remembering namesbut I knew his face
There were some of the others around him and they laughed at me and he laughed at me
Oh they had a heap of fun out of mefor a minute or two
Pretty good fun too
I guess theyll remember it quite a while
Go on
Louisa adjured him
The obvious proximity of the dramatic climax drew her forward in her chair and brought a glow of expectation to her eyes
I got myself away from that crowd somehowl think I was afraid if I stayed Id strangle the one who was shouting on the stepsand I went toward my office
But when I got to the door I didnt have the courage to go in
Id furnished it better I suppose than any other office in Austin Friars and I had a kind of feeling that the sight of those carpets and oaktables and desks and brassrailings and so on would make me sick
I owed for em all bear in mind ButJoel the sister interposed
One thing I dont understand
How many people had applied for shares
You havent mentioned that
A fleeting smile lighted up the saturnine gloom of his present mood
It was hardly worth mentioning he answered with bitter mirth
Between five and six thousand shares were subscribed all told
I think the withdrawals by telegraph brought it down to practically five thousand
We offered a hundred thousand you knowBut let me go on with my story
I stood there in front of our streetdoor in a kind of trance
The words of that JewSell Rubber Consols at three quarters
buzzed inside my head as if they would burst it open
I turnedand I happened to see my Brokerthe Scotchman Semple you knowcoming along toward me
Right at that minute like a flash something dawned on me
In less than a second I saw the whole damned rotten outfit turned upside down with me on top
I made a jump and ran to meet Semple
How many shares of ours have you bought
I asked him with a grip tight on his arm
The little chap was looking mighty sick
He figured up in his mind
Im afraid its eight thousand five hundred all told he said in a sort of Presbyterian whimper
Wellhow would these gentlemen go about it to deliver their goodsthat is supposing we got a settlement
I asked him this and kept my eye on his face
He looked puzzled for a minute
Then he put out his lip
Then he shot me a glance as sharp as a razor and we looked into one anothers eyes
They were shouting them out to me at threequarters a minute ago I told him
He was onto the game like lightning
Wait for me in the office he whispered
Well go nap on this
With that he was off like a streak
He stopped running just before he got to the corner though and began walking slowly sauntering along you know as if his mind was on nothing but secondhand books
I watched him out of sightand then I went back and up to the offices
The furniture didnt scare me a bit this time
Why I stopped and felt of the brassrailing just outside the Board Room and I said to myselfPshaw
We could have you of solid gold if we wanted to
He paused here and regarded his sister with what she felt was intended to be a significant look
She shrank from the confession that its meaning was Greek to her
Welland what next
she asked guardedly
Semple came back in twenty minutes or soand the next morning he was at it againand what with him and his jobber by George on the quiet they picked up nearly eighteen thousand of our shares
Some they paid fifteen shillings for some they got at twelveandsix and even ten
That doesnt matter its of no more importance than the coppers you give to crossingsweepers
The thing was to get the sharesand by God weve got them
Twentysix thousand two hundred shares thats what weve got
Now do you see what that means
Why yes she answered with a fainthearted assumption of confidence
Of course you know the property is so good that youll make a profit on the shares youve bought far below their value
But I dont think I quite see He interrupted her with an outburst of loud laughter
Dont think you quite see
he gurgled at her with tears of pleasure in his eye
Why you dummy you havent got the faintest glimmer of a notion of what its all about
The value of the propertys got nothing in the world to do with it
Thats neither here nor there
If there wasnt any such property in existence it would be just the same
He had compassion upon her blank countenance at this and explained more gently Why dont you see Lou its this way
This is what has happened
Weve got whats called a corner on the bears
Theyre caught short and we can squeeze them to our hearts content
Whatyou dont understand now
Why see here
These fellows whove sold twentysix thousand of our shares they havent got them to sell and they cant get them
That is the pointthey cant get them for love nor moneythey must pay me my own price for them or be ruined men
The moment they realize the situation they will begin offering a premium for Rubber Consols
The price of a onepound share will be two pounds then foursixtentwentythirtywhatever I want to drive it to
Louisa stared up at him with wide open eyes
It seemed to her that she understood now
It was very exciting
You see he went on taking approving note of the new light of comprehension in her glance we did something that Tuesday afternoon beside buy up these shares
Semple rushed off to his office and he and his clerks got up a lot of dummy applications for shares made out in all the different names they could be safe in using and they put these into the bank with the application moneySemple found thatand next day he went and saw the advertising agent and the solicitor and the auditorsand got them to pool the shares that Ive promised to give them
A pool
That means they agree to transfer their shares to me as trustee and let me deal with them as I likeof course to their advantage
In any case their shares are vendors shares and couldnt be dealt with in this transaction
So you see the thing is hermetically sealed
Nobody can get a share except from me and at my price
But these fellows that have sold themtheyve got to have them dont you see
They had their little temporary joke with me on the street that afternoonand now they must walk up to the captains office and settle
Theyve got to pay me at least half a million pounds for that few minutes fun of theirs
I may make it a good deal more I dont know yet
Oh Joel
she groaned at him in awed stupefaction
His rather languid indecision as to whether half a million was going to be enough impressed her more powerfully than had any detail of his narrative
In a few comprehensive sentences he finished up for her what there was to tell
This afternoon my Board met to allot the shares
They saw the applications amounting in all to over ninety thousand shares
It took their breath awaythey had heard that things were going quite the other way with us
They were so tickled that they asked no questions The allotment went through like a greased pig
About 5000 shares went to those who had actually applied for them and 88000 were solemnly given to the dummy applicants
Of course there wasnt a whisper about these dummies
Nobody winked so much as an eyelash
But Ive found since that one of the directorsthat Lord Plowden I told you aboutwas onto the thing all the while
But hes all right
Everybodys all right
Of course the dummies shares still stand in their nameson paper but in reality Ive got them all in my safein my pocket you might say
They are really mine you understand
So now theres nothing for us to do but to apply to the Stock Exchange for a special settlement date and meanwhile lie quiet and watch the Jews stew in their own juice
Or fry in their own fat eh
Thats better
But she commented slowly you say there are no shares to be boughtand yet as I understand it there are those five thousand that were sent out to the people who really applied
Bravo Lou
he answered her jovially
You actually do understand the thing
Youve put your finger straight on the point
It is true that those shares are out against usor might be turned against us if they could be bought up
But in reality they dont count at all
In the first place you see theyre scattered about among small holders country clergymen and old maids on an annuity and so onall over the country
Even if these people were all traced and hunted up suppose it was worth the trouble and expense they wouldnt sell
The bigger the price they were offered the more mulish they would be about holding
Thats always the way with them
But even if they did all sell their five thousand would be a mere drop in the bucket
There would be over twenty thousand others to be accounted for
That would be quite enough for my purposes
Oh I figured all that out very carefully
My own first notion was to have the dummies apply for the whole hundred thousand and even a little over
Then you see we might have allotted everything to the dummies and sent back the money and applications of the genuine ones
But that would have been rather hard to manage with the Board
The Markiss would have said that the returns ought to be made pro ratathat is giving everybody a part of what they applied forand that would have mixed everything up
And then too if anybody suspected anything why the Stock Exchange Committee would refuse us a special settlementand of course without that the whole transaction is moonshine
It was far too risky and we didnt send back a penny
Its all pretty risky I should think she declared as she rose
I should think youd lie awake more than ever nownow that youve built your hopes so high and itd be so awful to have them come to nothing
He smilingly shook his head
No it can no more fail than that gas can fail to burn when you put a light to it
Its all absolute
My halfmillion is as right as if it were lying to my credit in the Bank of England
Oh that reminds me he went on in a slightly altered tone its damned comical but Ive got to ask you for a little money
Ive only got about seven pounds at my bank and just at the minute it would give me away fearfully to let Semple know I was hard up
Of course hed let me have anything I wantedbut you can seeI dont like to ask him just at the moment
She hesitated visibly and scanned his face with a wistful gaze
Youre quite sure Joel
she began and you havent told mehow long will it be before you come into some of this money
Wellhe in turn paused over his wordswell I suppose that by next week things will be in such shape that my bank will see Im good for an overdraft
Oh heavens yes
therell be a hundred ways of touching some ready
But if youve got twenty or thirty pounds handy just nowI tell you what Ill do Lou
Ill give you a three months bill paying one hundred pounds for every sovereign you let me have now
Come old lady you dont get such interest every day Ill bet
I dont want any interest from you Joel she replied simply
If youre sure I can have it back before Christmas I think I can manage thirty pounds
It will do in the morning I suppose
He nodded an amused affirmative
Whyyou dont imagine do you he said that all this gold is to rain down and none of it hit you
Interest
Why of course youll get interestand capital thrown in
What did you suppose
I dont ask anything for myself she made answer with a note of resolution in her voice
Of course if you like to do things for the children it wont be me wholl stand in their light
Theyve been spoiled for my kind of life as it is
Ill do things for everybody he affirmed roundly
Lets seehow old is Alfred
Hell be twenty in Mayand Julia is fourteen months older than he is
Gad
was Thorpes meditative comment
How they shoot up
Why I was thinking she was a little girl
She never will be tall Im afraid said the literal mother
She favours her fathers family
But Alfred is more of a Thorpe
Im sorry you missed seeing them last summerbut of course they didnt stop long with me
This was no place for themand they had a good many invitations to visit schoolfellows and friends in the country
Alfred reminds me very much of what you were at his age hes got the same good opinion of himself tooand hes not a bit fonder of hard work
Theres one mighty big difference between us though remarked Thorpe
He wont start with his nose held down to the grindstone by an old father hard as nails
Hell start like a gentlemanthe nephew of a rich man
Im almost afraid to have such notions put in his head she replied with visible apprehension
You mustnt encourage him to build too high hopes Joel
Its speculation you knowand anything might happen to you
And thenyou may marry and have sons of your own
He lifted his brows swiftlyas if the thought were new to his mind
A slow smile stole into the little wrinkles about his eyes
He opened his lips as if to speak and then closed them again
Well he said at last abruptly straightening himself and casting an eye about for his coat and hat
Ill be round in the morningon my way to the City
Goodbye till then
CHAPTER IV IN Charing Cross station the next afternoon Mr Thorpe discovered by the big clock overhead that he had arrived fully ten minutes too soon
This deviation from his deeplyrooted habit of catching trains at the last possible moment did not take him by surprise
He smiled dryly aud nodded to the illuminated dial as if they shared the secret of some quaint novelty
This getting to the station ahead of time was of a piece with what had been happening all daymerely one more token of the general upheaval in the routine of his life
From early morning he had been acutely conscious of the feeling that his old manners and usages and methods of thoughtthe thousand familiar things that made up the Thorpe he had beenwere becoming strange to him
They fitted him no longer they began to fall away from him
Now as he stood here on the bustling platform it was as if they had all disappearedbeen left somewhere behind him outside the station
With the two large bags which the porter was looking afterboth of a quite disconcerting freshness of aspectand the new overcoat and shining hat he seemed to himself a new kind of being embarked upon a voyage of discovery in the unknown
Even his face was new
A sudden and irresistible impulse had led him to the barbershop in his hotel at the outset he could not wait till after breakfast to have his beard removed
The result when he beheld it in the mirror had not been altogether reassuring
The overlong thin tawny moustasche which survived the razor assumed an undue prominence the jaw and chin revealed now for the first time in perhaps a dozen years seemed of a sickly colour and in some inexplicable way misshapen
Many times during the day at his office at the restaurant where he lunched at various outfitters shops which he had visited he had pursued the task of getting reconciled to this novel visage in the lookingglass
The little mirrors in the hansom cabs had helped him most in this endeavour
Each returned to him an image so different from all the otherssome cadaverous some bloated but each with a spontaneous distortion of its ownthat it had become possible for him to strike an average tolerable to himself and to believe in it
His sister had recognized him upon the instant when he entered the old bookshop to get the money promised overnight but in the City his own clerks had not known him at first
There was in this an inspiring implication that he had not so much changed his appearance as revived his youth
The consciousness that he was in reality still a young man spread over his mind afresh and this time he felt that it was effacing all earlier impressions
Why when he thought of it the delight he had had during the day in buying new shirts and handkerchiefs and embroidered braces in looking over the various stocks of razors toilet articles studs and sleevelinks and the like and telling the gratified tradesmen to give him the best of everythingthis delight had been distinctively boyish
He doubted indeed if any mere youth could have risen to the heights of tender satisfaction from which he reflected upon the contents of his portmanteaus
To apprehend their full value one must have been without them for such a weary time
He had this wonderful advantagethat he supplemented the freshhearted joy of the youth in nice things with the adult mans knowledge of how bald existence could be without them
It was worth having lived all those forty obscure and mostly unpleasant years for this one privilege now of being able to appreciate to the uttermost the touch of doublesilk underwear
It was an undoubted pity that there had not been time to go to a good tailor
The suit he had on was right enough for ordinary purposes and his eveningclothes were as good as new but the thought of a costume for shooting harassed his mind
He had brought along with him for this eventful visit an old Mexican outfit of yellowishgrey cloth and leather much the worse for rough wear but saved from the disreputable by its suggestion of picturesque experiences in a strange and romantic country
At least it had seemed to him in the morning when he had packed it to be secure in this salvation
Uneasy doubts on the subject had soon risen however and they had increased in volume and poignancy as his conceptions of a wardrobe expanded in the course of the days investigations and purchases
He had reached the point now of hoping that it would rain bitterly on the morrow
It was doubly important to keep a close lookout for Lord Plowden since he did not know the name of the station they were to book for and time was getting short
He dwelt with some annoyance upon his oversight in this matter as his watchful glance ranged from one entrance to another
He would have liked to buy the tickets himself and have everything in readiness on the arrival of his host
As it was he could not even tell the porter how his luggage was to be labelled and there was now less than two minutes
He moved forward briskly with the thought of intercepting his friend at the front of the station then halted and went back upon the recollection that while he was going out one way Plowden might come in by the other
The seconds as they passed now became severally painful to his nerves
The ringing of a bell somewhere beyond the barrier provoked within him an impulse to tearful profanity
Then suddenly everything was all right
A smoothfaced civillyspoken young man came up touched his hat and asked Will you kindly show me which is your luggage sir
Thorpe even while wondering what business of his it was indicated the glaringly new bagsand then only half repressed a cry of pleasure at discovering that Lord Plowden stood beside him
Its all right my man will look out for your things said the latter as they shook hands
We will go and get our places
The fat policeman at the gate touched his helmet
A lean elderly man in a sort of guards uniform hobbled obsequiously before them down the platform opened to them a firstclass compartment with a low bow and a deprecatory wave of the hand and then impressively locked the door upon them
The engine will be the other way my Lord after you leave Cannon Street he remarked through the open window with earnest deference
Are there any of your bags that you want in the compartment with you
Plowden had nodded to the first remark
He shook his head at the second
The elderly man at this with still another bow flapped out a green flag which he had been holding furled behind his back and extended it at arms length
The train began slowly to move
Mr Thorpe reflected to himself that the peerage was by no means so playedout an institution as some people imagined
Hoho
the younger man sighed a yawn as he tossed his hat into the rack above his head
We shall both be the better for some pure air
London quite does me up
And youyouve been sticking at it months on end havent you
You look rather faggedor at all events you did yesterday
Youve smartened yourself sowithout your beardthat I cant say Id notice it today
But I take it every sensible person is glad to get away from London
Except for an odd Sunday now and then I havent put my nose outside London since I landed here
Thorpe rose as he spoke to deposit his hat also in the rack
He noted with a kind of chagrin that his companions was an ordinary low black bowler
I can tell you I SHALL be glad of the change
I would have bought the tickets he went on giving words at random to the thought which he found fixed on the surface of his mind if Id only known what our station was
Plowden waved his hand and the gesture seemed to dismiss the subject
He took a cigar case from his pocket and offered it to Thorpe
It was lucky my not missing the train altogether he said as they lighted their cigars
I was up late last nightturned out late this morning been late all day somehowcouldnt catch up with the clock for the life of me
Your statement to me last nightyou know it rather upset me
The other smiled
Well I guess I know something about that feeling myself
Why Ive been buzzing about today like a hen with her head cut off
But its fun though aint it eh
Just to happen to remember every once in a while you know that its all true
But of course it means a thousand times more to me than it does to you
The train had come to a stop inside the gloomy domed cavern of Cannon Street
Many men in silk hats crowded to and fro on the platform and a number of them shook the handle of the locked door
There was an effect of curses in the sound of their remarks which came through the closed window
Mr Thorpe could not quite restrain the impulse to grin at them
Ah thats where you mistake said Plowden contemplating the mouthful of smoke he slowly blew forth
My dear man you cant imagine anybody to whom it would mean more than it does to meI hope none of those fellows have a key
Theyre an awful bore on this train
I almost never go by it for that reason
Ah thank God were offBut as I was saying this thing makes a greater difference to me than you can think of
I couldnt sleep last nightI give you my wordthe thing upset me so
I take it youyou have never had much money before that is you know from experience what poverty is
Thorpe nodded with eloquent gravity
Wellbut youthe other began and then paused
What I mean is he resumed you were never at any rate responsible to anybody but yourself
If you had only a sovereign a day or a sovereign a week for that matter you could accommodate yourself to the requirements of the situation
I dont mean that you would enjoy it any more than I shouldbut at least it was open to you to do it without attracting much attention
But with me placed in my ridiculous positionpoverty has been the most unbearable torture one can imagine
You see there is no way in which I can earn a penny
I had to leave the Army when I was twentythreethe other fellows all had plenty of money to spend and it was impossible for me to drag along with a title and an empty pocket
I daresay that I ought to have stuck to it because it isnt nearly so bad now but twelve years ago it was too cruel for any youngster who had any pride about himand of course my father having made rather a name in the Army that made it so much harder for me
And after that what was there
Of course the bar and medicine and engineering and those things were out of the question in those days at least
The Churchthat was more so still
I had a try at politicsbut you need money there as much as anywhere elsemoney or big family connections
I voted in practically every division for four years and I made the rottenest speeches you ever heard of at Primrose League meetings in small places and after all that the best thing the whips could offer me was a billet in India at four hundred a year and even that you took in depreciated rupees
When I tried to talk about something at home they practically laughed in my face
I had no leverage upon them whatever
They didnt care in the least whether I came up and voted or stopped at home
Their majority was ten to one just the sameyes twenty to one
So that door was shut in my face
Ive never been inside the House sinceexcept once to show it to an American lady last summerbut when I do go again I rather fancyhe stopped for an instant and nodded his handsome head significantlyI rather fancy I shall turn up on the other side
Im a Liberal myself in English politics interposed Thorpe
Plowden seemed not to perceive the connection
They had left London Bridge behind and he put his feet up on the cushions and leant back comfortably
Of course there was the City he went on speaking diagonally across to his companion between leisurely intervals of absorption in his cigar
There have been some directors fees no doubt and once or twice Ive come very near to what promised to be a big thingbut I never quite pulled it off
Really without capital what can one doIm curious to knowdid you bring much ready money with you to England
Between six and seven thousand pounds
And if its a fair questionhow much of it have you got left
Thorpe had some momentary doubts as to whether this was a fair question but he smothered them under the smile with which he felt impelled to answer the twinkle in Plowdens eyes
Oh less than a hundred he said and laughed aloud
Plowden also laughed
By George thats fine
he cried
Its splendid
Theres drama in it
I felt it was like that you know
Something told me it was your last cartridge that rang the bell
It was that that made me come to you as I didand tell you that you were a great man and that I wanted to enlist under you
Ah that kind of courage is so rare
When a man has it he can stand the world on its head
But I was plumb scared all the while myself Thorpe protested genially
Courage
I could feel it running out of my boots
Ah yes but thats the great thing insisted the other
You didnt look as if you were frightened
From all one could see your nerve was sublime
And nothing else mattersit was sublime
Curiousthat thing happened to me once before commented Thorpe with ruminating slowness
It was out on the plains years ago and I was in pretty hard luck and was making my way alone from Tucson north and some cowboys held me up and were going to make kindling wood of me they being under the impression that I was a horsethief they were looking after
There was five or six minutes there when my life wasnt worth a last years birdsnestand I tell you sir I was the scaredest man that ever drew the breath of life
And then something happened to be said that put the matter rightthey saw I was the wrong manand thenwhy then they couldnt be polite enough to me
They half emptied their flasks down my throat and they rode with me all the way to the next town and there they wanted to buy everything liquid in the place for me
But what I was speaking ofdo you know those fellows got a tremendous notion of my nerve
It wasnt so much that they told me so but they told others about it
They really thought I was game to the corewhen in reality as I tell you I was in the deadliest funk you ever heard of Thats just it said Plowden the part of you which was engaged in making mental notes of the occasion thought you were frightened we will say that it was itself frightened
But the other part of you the part that was transacting business so to speakthat wasnt in the least alarmed
I fancy all born commanders are built like that
Did you ever see General Grant
Thorpe shook his head
What reminded me of himthere is an account in his Memoirs of how he felt when he first was given a command at the beginning of the Civil War
He was looking about for the enemy who was known to be in the vicinity and the nearer he got to where this enemy probably was the more he got timid and unnerved he says until it seemed as if cowardice were getting complete mastery of him
And then suddenly it occurred to him that very likely the enemy was just as afraid of him as he was of the enemy and that moment his bravery all returned to him
He went in and gave the other man a terrible thrashing
It doesnt apply to your case particularlybut I fancy that all really brave men have those inner convictions of weakness even while they are behaving like lions
Those must have been extraordinarily interesting experiences of yourson the plains
I wish I could have seen something of that part of America when I was there last year
Unfortunately it didnt come my way
I thought I remembered your saying youd been West
Plowden smiled
Im afraid I did think it was West at the time
But since my return Ive been warned that I mustnt call Chicago West
That was as far as I went
I had some business there or thought I had
When my father died that was in 1884 we found among his papers a lot of bonds of some corporation purporting to be chartered by the State of Illinois
Our solicitors wrote several letters but they could find out nothing about them and there the matter rested
Finally last year when I decided to make the trip I recollected these old bonds and took them with me
I thought they might at least pay my expenses
But it wasnt the least good
Nobody knew anything about them
It seems they related to something that was burned up in the Great Fireeither that or had disappeared before that time
That fire seems to have operated like the Delugeit cancelled everything that had happened previously
My unhappy father had a genius for that kind of investment
I shall have great pleasure in showing you tomorrow a very picturesque and comprehensive collection of Confederate Bonds
Their face value is as I remember it eighty thousand dollarsthat is sixteen thousand pounds
I would entertain with joy an offer of sixteen shillings for the lot
My dear father bought themI should not be surprised to learn that he bought them at a premium
If they ever touched a premium for a day that is certainly the day that he would have hit upon to buy
Oh it was too rare
Too inspired
He left nearly a hundred thousand pounds worth of paperthat is on its faceupon which the solicitors realized I think it was thirteen hundred pounds
Its hard to imagine how he got thembut there were actually bonds among them issued by Kossuths Hungarian Republic in 1848
Wellnow you can see the kind of inheritance I came into and I have a brother and sister more or less to look after too
Thorpe had been listening to these details with an almost exaggerated expression of sympathy upon his face
The voice in which he spoke now betrayed however a certain note of incredulity
Yes I see that well enough he remarked
But what I dont perhaps quite understandwell this is it
You have this place of yours in the country and preserve game and so onbut of course I see what you mean
Its what youve been saying
What another man would think a comfortable living is poverty to a man in your position
Oh the place said Plowden
It isnt mine at all
I could never have kept it up
It belongs to my mother
It was her fathers place it has been in their family for hundreds of years
Her father I daresay you know was the last Earl of Hever
The title died with him
He left three daughters who inherited his estates and my mother being the eldest got the Kentish properties
Of course Hadlow House will come to me eventually but it is hers during her lifetime
I may speak of it as my place but that is merely a facon de parler it isnt necessary to explain to everybody that its my mothers
Its my home and thats enough
Its a dear old place
I cant tell you how glad I am that youre going to see it
Im very glad too said the other with unaffected sincerity
All the ambitions I have in the world the nobleman went on sitting upright now and speaking with a confidential seriousness centre round Hadlow
That is the part of me that Im keen about
The Plowdens are things of yesterday
My grandfather the Chancellor began in a very small way and was never anything more than a clever lawyer with a loud voice and a hard heart and a talent for moneymaking and politics
He got a peerage and he left a fortune
My father for all he was a soldier had a mild voice and a soft heart
He gave a certain military distinction to the peerage but he played hellandtommy with the fortune
And then I come I cant be either a Chancellor or a General and I havent a penny to bless myself with
You cant think of a more idiotic box for a man to be in
But nowthanks to youthere comes this prospect of an immense change
If I have money at my backat once everything is different with me
People will remember then promptly enough that I am a Hadlow as well as a Plowden
I will make the party whips remember it too
It wont be a Secretarys billet in India at four hundred a year that theyll offer me but a Governorship at six thousandthat is if I wish to leave England at all
And well see which set of whips are to have the honour of offering me anything
But all that is in the air
Its enough for the moment to realize that things have really come my way
And about thatabout the success of the affairI suppose there can be no question whatever
Not the slightest Thorpe assured him
Rubber Consols can go up to any figure we choose to name
Lord Plowden proffered the cigar case again and once more helped himself after he had given his companion a light
Then he threw himself back against the cushions with a long sigh of content
Im not going to say another word about myself he announced pleasantly
Ive had more than my legitimate innings
You mustnt think that I forget for a moment the reverse of the medal
Youre doing wonderful things for me
I only wish it were clearer to me what the wonderful things are that I can do for you
Oh thatll be all right said the other rather vaguely
Perhaps its a little early for you to have mapped out in your mind just what you want to do Plowden reflected aloud
Of course it has come suddenly upon youjust as it has upon me
There are things in plenty that weve dreamed of doing while the power to do them was a long way off
It doesnt at all follow that these are the things we shall proceed to do when the power is actually in our hands
But have you any plans at all
Do you fancy going into Parliament for example
Yes answered Thorpe meditatively
I think I should like to go into Parliament
But that would be some way ahead
I guess Ive got my plans worked out a trifle more than you think
They may not be very definite as regards details but their main direction I know well enough
Im going to be an English country gentleman
Lord Plowden visibly winced a little at this announcement
He seemed annoyed at the consciousness that he had done so turning abruptly first to stare out of the window then shifting his position on the seat and at last stealing an uneasy glance toward his companion
Apparently his tongue was at a loss for an appropriate comment
Thorpe had lost none of these unwilling tokens of embarrassment
Plowden saw that at once but it relieved even more than it surprised him to see also that Thorpe appeared not to mind
The older man indeed smiled in goodnatured if somewhat ironical comprehension of the dumbshow
Oh thatll be all right too he said with the evident intention of reassurance
I can do it right enough so far as the big things are concerned
Itll be in the little things that Ill want some steering
Ive already told youyou may command me to the utmost of my power the other declared
Upon reflection he was disposed to be ashamed of himself
His nerves and facial muscles had been guilty of an unpardonable lapse into snobbishnessand toward a man too who had been capable of behaviour more distinguished in its courtesy and generosity than any he had encountered in all the upper circles put together
He recalled all at once moreover that Thorpes hs were perfectaud for some occult reason this completed his confusion
My dear fellowhe began again confronting with verbal awkwardness the others quizzical smiledont think I doubt anything about you
I know well enough that you can do anythingbe anythingyou like
Thorpe laughed softly
I dont think you know though that Im a public school man he said
Plowden lifted his brows in unfeigned surprise
NoI didnt know that he admitted frankly
Yes Im a Pauls Pigeon Thorpe went on as they called them in my day
Thats gone out now Im told since theyve moved to the big buildings in Hammersmith
I did very well at school too came out in the first fourteen
But my father wouldnt carry the thing any further
He insisted on my going into the shop when I left St Pauls and learning the bookbusiness
He had precisely the same kind of dynastic idea you know that you fellows have
His father and his grandfather had been booksellers and he was going to hand on the tradition to me and my son after me
That was his idea
And he thought that Pauls would help thisbut that Oxford would kill it
Of course he was right therebut he was wrong in supposing there was a bookseller in me
I liked the books well enough mind youbut damn the people that came to buy them I couldnt stand it
You stood two hours watching to see that men didnt put volumes in their pockets and at the end of that time youd made a profit of ninepence
While you were doing up the parcel some fellow walked off with a book worth eighteenpence
It was too slow for me
I didnt hit it off with the old man either
We didnt precisely quarrel but I went off on my own hook
I hung about London for some years trying this thing and that
Once I started a bookshop of my ownbut I did no good here
Finally I turned it up altogether and went to Australia
That was in 1882
Ive been in almost every quarter of the globe since Ive known what it was to be shipwrecked in a monsoon and Ive lain down in a desert not expecting to get up again with my belt tightened to its last hole for hungerbut I cant remember that I ever wished myself back in my fathers bookshop
Plowdens fine eyes sparkled his appreciation of the others mood
He was silent for a moment then lifted his head as if something had occurred to him
You were speaking of the plan that you should succeed to your fathers businessand your son after youyoure not married are you
Thorpe slowly shook his head
Our station is the next said the younger man
Its a drive of something under two miles
Youd better light another cigar
He added as if upon a casual afterthought We can both of us think of marrying now
CHAPTER V FOR the next two hours Thorpes thoughts were almost wholly occupied with various phases of the large subject of domestic service
He seemed suddenly to have been transported to some region populated exclusively by cleanshaven men in brown livery
One of these was holding a spirited horse outside the station and when Lord Plowden had taken the reins and Thorpe had gathered the rugs about his knees and feet this menial silently associated himself with the young man who had accompanied them from town on the back seat of the trap
With these people so close behind him Thorpe felt that any intimate conversation was out of the question
Indeed talk of any sort was not invited the big horse burst forth with high sprawling strides upon a career through the twilight once the main road was reached which it taxed all Plowdens energies to regulate
He kept up a continual murmuring monologue to the animalSosoquiet my petso soeasy my beautysosoand his wrists and gloved hands were visibly under a tremendous tension of strain as they held their own against the rigid arched neck and mouth of steel
Thorpe kept a grip on the side of the trap and had only a modified pleasure in the drive
The road along which they sped seemed in the gathering dusk uncomfortably narrow and he speculated a good deal as to how frightened the two mutes behind him must be
But silence was such a law of their life that though he strained his ears he could not so much as hear them sigh or gasp
It seemed but a very few minutes before they turned off with but the most fleeting diminution of pace upon a private road which speedily developed into an avenue of trees quite dark and apparently narrower than ever
Down this they raced precipitately and then coming out all at once upon an open space swung smartly round the crescent of a gravel road and halted before what seemed to be the door of a greenhouse
Thorpe as he stood up in the trap got an uncertain general idea of a low palecoloured mansion in the background with lights showing behind curtains in several widely separated windows what he had taken to be a conservatory revealed itself now to be a glass gallery built along the front of the central portion of this house
A profusion of hospitable lightstall waxcandles in brackets among the vines against the trellised wall gave to this outlying entrance what the stranger felt to be a delightful effect
Its smooth tiled floor comfortably bestrewn with rugs was on a level with the path outside
There were low easychairs here and a little wicker table bearing books and a ladys workbasket
Further on giant chrysanthemum blooms were massed beneath the clusters of pale plumbagoflowers on the trellis
Directly in front across the dozen feet of this glazed vestibule the broad doorway of the house proper stood openwith warm lights glowing richly upon dark woods in the luxurious obscurity within
What Thorpe noted most of all however was the servants who seemed to swarm everywhere
The two who had alighted from the trap had contrived somehow mysteriously to multiply themselves in the darkness
All at once there were a number of young menat the horses head at the back and sides of the trap at the first doorway and the second and beyondeach presenting such a smoothfaced pallid brownclad replica of all the others that Thorpe knew he should never be able to tell them apart
Lord Plowden paused for a moment under the candlelight to look at his watch
We did it in a bit over eight minutes he remarked with obvious satisfaction
With four people and heavy roads thats not so badnot so bad
But come inside
They moved forward through the wide doorway into an apartment the like of which Thorpe had not seen before
It was a large square room with a big staircase at the end which separated and went off to right and left halfway up its visible course
Its floor was of inlaid woods old and uneven from long use and carpeted here and there by the skins of tigers and leopards
There were many other suggestions of the chase about the room riding boots whips spurs and some stands of archaic weapons caught the eye at various points the heads of foxes and deer peeped out on the blackened panels of the walls from among clusters of hooks crowded with coats hats and mackintoshes
At the right where a fire glowed and blazed under a huge open chimneyplace there were low chairs and divans drawn up to mark off a space for orderly domestic occupation
The irregularity of every thing outsidethe great table in the centre of the hall strewn with an incongruous litter of caps books flasks newspapers gloves tobaccopouches the shoes slippers and leggings scattered under the benches at the sidesall this selfrenewing disorder of a careless household struck Thorpe with a profound surprise
It was like nothing so much as a Mexican ranchand to find it in the ancestral home of an English nobleman filled to overflowing with servants amazed him
The glances that he cast about him however were impassive enough
His mind was charged with the ceaseless responsibility of being astonished at nothing
A man took his hat and helped him off with his coat
Another moved toward the staircase with his two bags
If you will follow Pangbourn said his host indicating this second domestic he will look after you
You would like to go up and change now wouldnt you
Theres a fire in your room
Thus dismissed he went up the stairs in the wake of his portmanteaus taking the turning to the left and then proceeding by a long low passage round more than one corner to what he conceived to be a wing of the house
The servant ushered him into a roomand in despite of himself he sighed with pleasure at the sight of it
The prettiest and most charming of rooms it seemed to him to bespacious and quaintly rambling in shape with a delicatelyfigured chintz repeating the dainty effects of the walls upon the curtains and carpet and bedhangings and chaircovers and with a bright fire in the grate throwing its warm cozy glow over everything
He looked at the pictures on the walls at the photographs and little ornaments on the writing desk and the high posts and silken coverlet of the big bed and secure in the averted face of the servant smiled richly to himself
This servant kneeling had unstrapped and opened the new bags
Thorpe looked to see him quit the room this task accomplished and was conscious of something like dismay at the discovery that he intended to unpack them as well
Pangbourn began gravely to unwrap one paper parcel after another and to assort their contents in little heaps on the sofa beside him
He did it deftly imperturbably as if all the gentlemen he had ever seen carried their belongings in packages done up by tradesmen
Thorpes impulse to bid him desist framed itself in words on the tip of his tonguebut he did not utter these words
After circling idly hands in pockets about the man and the bags for a little time he invented something which it seemed better for him to say
I dont know what youll be able to make of those things he remarked casually
My man has been buying them todayand I dont know what he maynt have forgotten
My whole outfit of that sort of thing went astray or was stolen at some station or otherthe first part of the weekI think it must have been Leeds
Yes sir said Pangbourn without emotion
Theyre very careless sir
He went on impassively shaking out the black garments and spreading them on the bed laying out a shirt and tie beside them and arranging the razors strop and brushes on the dressingtable
He seemed to foresee everythingfor there was not an instants hesitation in the clocklike assiduity of his movements as he bestowed handkerchiefs in one drawer socks in another hung pyjamas before the fire and set the patentleather pumps against the fender
Even the old Mexican shootingsuit seemed in no way to disconcert him
He drew forth its constituent elements as with a practised hand when he had hung them up sombrero and all in the wardrobe against the wall they had the trick of making that venerable oaken receptacle look as if it had been fashioned expressly for them
Thorpes earlier uneasiness quite lost itself in his admiration for Pangbourns resourceful dexterity
The delighted thought that now he would be needing a man like this for himself crossed his mind
Conceivably he might even get this identical Pangbourntreasure though he were
Money could command everything on this broad globeand why not Pangbourn
He tentatively felt of the coins in his pocket as it became apparent that the mans task was nearing completionand then frowned at himself for forgetting that these things were always reserved for the end of a visit
Will you dress now sir
asked Pangbourn
His soft distinct enunciation conveyed the suggestion of centuries of training
Eh
said Thorpe finding himself for the moment behind the others thought
Shall you require me any further sir
the man reframed the question deferentially
Oh
Ohno replied Thorpe
NoIll get along all right
Left to himself he began hurriedly the task of shaving and dressing
The candles on either side of the thick bevelled swinging mirror presented a somewhat embarrassing contrast to the electric light he was used tobut upon second thought he preferred this restrained aristocratic glimmer
He had completed his toilet and was standing at the baywindow with his shoulder holding back the edge of the curtain looking out upon the darkened lawn and wondering whether he ought to go downstairs or wait for someone to summon him when he heard a knock at his door
Before he could answer the door opened and he made out in the candleand firelight that it was Lord Plowden who had come in
He stepped forward to meet his host who clad now in eveningclothes was smoking a cigarette
Have they looked after you all right
said Plowden nonchalantly
Have a cigarette before we go down
Light it by the candle
They never will keep matches in a bedroom
He seated himself in an easychair before the fire as he spoke and stretched out his shining slippers toward the grate
I thought Id tell you before we went downhe went on as Thorpe with an elbow on the mantel looked down at his handsome headmy sister has a couple of ladies visiting her
One of them I think you know
Do you remember on shipboard a Miss Maddenan American you knowvery tall and fine with bright red hairrather remarkable hair it was
I remember the lady said Thorpe upon reflection but we didnt meet
He could not wholly divest his tone of the hint that in those days it by no means followed that because he saw ladies it was open to him to know them
Lord Plowden smiled a little
Oh youll like her
Shes great funif shes in the mood
My mother and sisterI had them call on her in London last springand they took a great fancy to her
Shes got no end of money you knowat least a million and a halfdollars unfortunately
Her parents were Irishher father made his pile in the waggon business I believebut shes as American as if theyd crossed over inwhat was it the Sunflowerno the Mayflower
Marvelous country for assimilation that America is
You remember what I told youits put such a mark on you that I should never have dreamt you were English
Thorpe observed his companion through a blue haze of smoke in silence
This insistence upon the unEnglish nature of the effect he produced was not altogether grateful to his ears
The other one continued Plowden is Lady Cressage
Youll be interested in herbecause a few years ago she was supposed to be the most beautiful woman in London
She married a shocking bounderhe would have been Duke of Glastonbury though if he had livedbut he was drowned and she was left poor as a church mouse
Oh
by the way
he started up with a gleam of aroused interest on his faceit didnt in the least occur to me
Why shes a daughter of our General Kervick
How did he get on the Board by the way
Where did you pick him up
Thorpe bent his brows in puzzled lines
Why you introduced me to him yourself didnt you
he asked slowly
Plowden seemed unaffectedly surprised at the suggestion as he turned it over in his mind
By George
I think youre right he said
Id quite forgotten it
Of course I did
Let me seeoh yes I reconstruct it readily enough now
Poor old chappiehe needs all he can get
He was bothering her about moneythat was it I remember nowbut what an idiot I was to forget it
But what I was sayingtheres no one else but my mother and sister and my brother Balder
Hes a youngstertwenty or thereaboutsand he purports to be reading for his exams for the Army
If they opened his head though I doubt if theyd find anything but cricket and football unless it might be a bit of golf
Wellthats the party
I thought you might like to have a notion of them in advance
If youve finished your cigarettehe threw his own into the grate and rose as he spokewe may as well be moving along
By the way he concluded as they walked toward the door Ive an idea that we wont say anything just at the moment about our great coup
I should like to keep it as a little surprisefor my mother and sister you know
Some two hours later Thorpe found the leisure and the restored equanimity needful for a dispassionate survey of his surroundings
He had become temporarily detached from the group over by the fireplace in the big drawingroom and was for the first time that evening very much at his ease
It was all much simpler upon experiment than he had feared
He stood now in a corner of the ornate apartment whither he had wandered in examining the pictures on the walls and contemplated with serenity the five people whom he had left behind him
He was conscious of the conviction that when he rejoined them it would be on a new footing of assured equality
He knew now the exact measure of everything
The Hon
Balder Plowdena tall heavilybuilt youth with enormous shoulders and thick hard hands and pale strawcoloured hair and brows and eyelasheshad amiably sauntered beside him and was elucidating for his benefit now in slow halting undertones some unfathomable mystery connected with the varying attitude of two distinct breeds of terriers toward rats
Across the room just within reach of the flickering ruddy firelight from the hearth the American guest Miss Madden was seated at the piano playing some low and rather doleful music
Thorpe bent his head and assumed an air of attention but in truth he listened to neither the Honourable Balder nor the piano
His thoughts were concentrated jealously upon his own position in this novel setting
He said to himself that it was all right
Old Lady Plowden had seemed to like him from the start
The genial if somewhat abstracted motherliness of her welcome had been indeed his sheet anchor throughout the evening
She had not once failed to nod her head and smile and twinkle her little kind eyes through their spectacles at him whenever by word or look he had addressed her
Nor did his original halfsuspicion that this was her manner to people in general justify itself upon observation
She was civil even excessively civil to the other two guests but these ladies did not get the same eager and intent smile that he could command
He reasoned it out that Plowden must have said something pleasant to his mother about himperhaps even to the point of explaining that he was to be the architect of their fortunesbut he did not like to ascribe all her hospitable warmth to that
It was dear to him to believe that she liked him on his own meritsand he did believe it as his softened glance rested upon her where she sat almost facing him in her padded wicker chairsmall whitehaired rosycheeked her intelligent face radiating a kind of alert placidity which somehow made him feel at home
He had not been as much at home with the others
The Honourable Balder of course didnt count nobody paid attention to him and least of all a busy Rubber King
He gave not much more heed to the Americanthe tall young woman with the red hair and the million and a half of dollars
She was plainly a visitor like himself not at all identified with the inner life of the household
He fancied moreover that she in no way desired to be thus identified
She seemed to carry herself with a deliberate aloofness underlying her surface amiability
Then he had spoken his few words with her once or twice he had got this effect of stony reserve close beneath her smile and smooth words
True this might mean only that she felt herself out of her element just as he didbut to him really it did not matter what she felt
A year agowhy yes even a fortnight agothe golden rumour of millions would have shone round her auburn hair in his eyes like a halo
But all that was changed
Calculated in a solidified currency her reported fortune shrank to a mere three hundred thousand pounds
It was a respectable sum for a woman to have no doubt but it did nothing to quicken the cool indifference with which he considered her
The two other young women were different
They were seated together on a sofa so placed as regarded his point of view that he saw only in part the shadowed profiles of the faces they turned toward the piano
Although it was not visible to him the posture of their shoulders told him that they were listening to the music each holding the others hand
This tacit embrace was typical in his mind of the way they hung together these two young women
It had been forced upon his perceptions all the evening that this fairhaired beautiful rather stately Lady Cressage and the small swarthy roundshouldered daughter of the house peering through her pincenez from under unduly thick black brows formed a party of their own
Their politeness toward him had been as identical in all its little shades of distance and reservation as if they had been governed from a single braincentre
It would be unfair to them to assume from their manner that they disliked him or were even unfavourably impressed by him
The finesse of that manner was far too delicate a thing to call into use such rough characterizations
It was rather their action as a unit which piqued his interest
He thought he could see that they united upon a common demeanour toward the American girl although of course they knew her much better than they knew him
It was not even clear to him that there were not traces of this combination in their tone toward Plowden and the Honourable Balder
The bond between them had twisted in it strands of social exclusiveness and strands of sex sympathy
He did not analyze all this with much closeness in his thoughts but the impressions of it were distinct enough to him
He rather enjoyed these impressions than otherwise
Women had not often interested him consecutively to any large degree either in detail or as a whole
He had formulated among other loose general notions of them however the idea that their failure to stand by one another was one of their gravest weaknesses
This proposition rose suddenly now in his mind and claimed his attention
It became apparent to him all at once that his opinions about women would be henceforth invested with a new importance
He had scarcely before in his life worn evening dress in a domestic circle which included ladiescertainly never in the presence of such certificated and hallmarked ladies as these
His future however was to be filled with experiences of this nature
Already after this briefest of ventures into the new life he found fresh conceptions of the great subject springing up in his thoughts
In this matter of women sticking together for examplehere before his eyes was one of the prettiest instances of it imaginable
As he looked again at the two figures on the sofa so markedly unlike in outward aspect yet knit to each other in such a sisterly bond he found the spectacle really touching
Lady Cressage had inclined her classic profile even more toward the piano
Thorpe was not stirred at all by the music but the spirit of it as it was reflected upon this beautiful facial outlinesensitive highspirited somewhat sad withalappealed to something in him
He moved forward cautiously noiselessly a dozen restricted paces and halted again at the corner of a table
It was a relief that the Honourable Balder though he followed along respected now his obvious wish for silence
But neither Balder nor anyone else could guess that the music said less than nothing to his earsthat it was the face that had beckoned him to advance
Covertly with momentary assurances that no one observed him he studied this face and mused upon it
The white candlelight on the shining wall beyond threw everything into a soft uniform shadow this side of the thread of dark tracery which outlined forehead and nose and lips and chin
It seemed to him that the eyes were closed as in reverie he could not be sure
So she would have been a Duchess if her husband had lived
He said to himself that he had never seen before or imagined a face which belonged so indubitably beneath a tiara of strawberry leaves in diamonds
The pride and grace and composure yes and melancholy of the great ladythey were all there in their supreme expression
And yetwhy she was no great lady at all
She was the daughter of his old General Kervickthe necessitous and haughtilyhumble old military gentleman with the grey moustache and the premature fur coat who did what he was told on the Board without a question for a pitiful three hundred a year
Yesshe was his daughter and she also was poor
Plowden had said so
Why had Plowden by the way been so keen about relieving her from her fathers importunities
He must have had it very much at heart to have invented the roundabout plan of getting the old gentleman a directorship
But nothere was nothing in that
Why Plowden had even forgotten that it was he who suggested Kervicks name
It would have been his sister of course who was evidently such chums with Lady Cressage who gave him the hint to help the General to something if he could
And when you came to think of it these aristocrats and military men and so on had no other notion of making money save by directorships
Clearly that was the way of it
Plowden had remembered Kervicks name when the chance arose to give the old boy a leg up and then had clean forgotten the circumstance
The episode rather increased his liking for Plowden
He glanced briefly under the impulse of his thought to where the peer sat or rather sprawled in a big low chair before the fire
He was so nearly recumbent in it indeed that there was nothing to be seen of him but an elbow and two very trim legs extended to the brass fender
Thorpes gaze reverted automatically to the face of General Kervicks daughter
He wondered if she knew about the Company and about him and about his ability to solidify to any extent her fathers financial position
Even more upon reflection he wondered whether she was very fond of her father would she be extremely grateful to one who should render him securely comfortable for life
Miss Madden rose from the piano before Thorpe noted that the music had ceased
There came from the others a soft but fervent chorus of exclamations the sincerity and enthusiasm of which made him a little ashamed
He had evidently been deaf to something that deeply moved the rest
Even Balder made remarks which seemed to be regarded as apposite
What IS it
asked Lady Cressage with obvious feeling
I dont know when anything has touched me so much
Old Danish songs that I picked up on the quai in Paris for a franc or two replied Miss Madden
I arranged and harmonized themand oddly enough the result is rather Keltic dont you think
We are all of us Kelts in our welcome to musicand musicianslike this affirmed Lord Plowden who had scrambled to his feet
With sudden resolution Thorpe moved forward and joined the conversation
CHAPTER VI THORPES lifelong habit of early rising brought him downstairs next morning before anybody else in the house apparently was astir
At all events he saw no one in either the hall or the glass vestibule as he wandered about
Both doors were wide open however to the mild damp morning air
He found on one of the racks a cap that was less uncomfortable than the others and sauntered forth to look about him
His nerves were by no means in so serene a state as his reason told him they ought to be
The disquieting impression of bad dreams hung about him
The waking houralways an evil time for him in these latter days of anxietyhad been this morning a peculiarly depressing affair
It had seemed to him in the first minutes of reviving consciousness that he was a hopelessly ruined and discredited man the illusion of disaster had been indeed so complete and vivid that even now more than an hour later he had not shaken off its effects
He applied his mental energies as he strolled along the gravel paths to the task of reassuring himself
There were still elements of chance in the game of course but it was easy enough here in the daylight to demonstrate that they had been cut down to a minimumthat it was nonsense to borrow trouble about them
He reviewed the situation in painstaking detail and at every point it was all right or as nearly all right as any human business could be
He scolded himself sharply for this foolish susceptibility to the intimidation of nightmares
Look at Plowden
he bade his dolorous spirit
See how easy he takes things
It was undeniable that Lord Plowden took things very easily indeed
He had talked with eloquence and feeling about the miseries and humiliations of a peerage inadequately endowed with money but no traces of his sufferings were visible to Thorpes observant eye
The nobleman himself looked the very image of contented prosperityhandsome buoyant lighthearted and withal the bestgroomed man in London
And this ancestral home of hisor of his mothers since he seemed to insist upon the distinctionwhere were its signs of a stinted income
The place was overrun with servants
There was a horse which covered a distance of something like two miles in eight minutes
Inside and out Hadlow House suggested nothing but assured plenty
Yet its master told the most unvarying tales of poverty and no doubt they were in one sense true
What he wished to fix his mind upon and to draw strength for himself from was the gay courage with which these Plowdens behaved as if they were rich
The grounds at the front of the house hemmed in by high hedges and trees from what seemed to be a public road beyond were fairly spacious but the sleek decorum of their arrangement while it pleased him was scarcely interesting
He liked better to study the house itself which in the daylight revealed itself as his ideal of what a historic English countryhouse of the minor class should be
There had been a period in his youth when architecture had attracted him greatly as offering a congenial and lucrative career
Not much remained to him now of the classifications and phraseology which he had gone to the trouble of memorizing in that faroff time but he still looked at buildings with a kind of professional consciousness
Hadlow House said intelligible things to him and he was pleased with himself for understanding them
It was not new in any part apparently but there was nothing pretentious in its antiquity
It had never been a castle or a fortified residence
No violent alteration in habits or needs distinguished its present occupants from its original builders
It had been planned and reared as a home for gentle people at some nottooremote date when it was already possible for gentle people to have homes without fighting to defend them
One could fancy that its calm and infinitely comfortable history had never been ruffled from that day to this
He recalled having heard it mentioned the previous evening that the house stood upon the site of an old monastery
No doubt that accounted for its being built in a hollow with the groundfloor on the absolute level of the earth outside
The monks had always chosen these lowlying sheltered spots for their cloisters
Why should they have done so
he wonderedand then came to a sudden mental stop absorbed in a somewhat surprised contemplation of a new version of himself
He was becoming literary historical bookish
His mind had begun to throw open again to abstract thoughts and musings its longclosed doors
He had read and dreamed so much as a lad in the old bookshop
For many years that boyhood of eager concern in the printed page had seemed to him to belong to somebody else
Now all at once it came back to him as his own possession he felt that he could take up books again where he had dropped them perhaps even with the old rapt intent zest
Visions rose before him of the magnificent library he would gather for himself
And it should be in no wise for showthe gross ostentation of the unlettered parvenubut a genuine library which should minister to his own individual culture
The thought took instant hold upon his interest
By that road his progress to the goal of gentility would be smooth and simple
He seemed not to have reasoned it out to himself in detail before but now at all events he saw his way clearly enough
Why should he be tormented with doubts and misgivings about himself as if he had come out of the gutter
Why indeed
He had passed throughand with credit tooone of the great public schools of England
He had been there on a footing of perfect equality so far as he saw with the sons of aristocratic families or of great City potentates
And as to birth he had behind him three generations at least of scholarly men men who knew the contents as well as the commercial value of the books they handled
His grandfather had been a man of note in his calling
The tradition of Lord Althorps confidence in him and of how he requited it by securing Caxtons Golden Legend for the library of that distinguished collector under the very nose of his hot rival the Duke of Marlborough was tenderly cherished as an heirloom in the old shop
And Thorpes father too though no such single achievement crowned his memory had been the adviser and as one might say the friend of many notable writers and patrons of literature
The son of such forbears needed only money to be recognized by everybody as a gentleman
On his mothers side now that he thought of it there was something perhaps better still than a heritage of librarians craft and tastes
His mothers maiden name was Stormont and he remembered well enough the solemnity with which she had always alluded to the fact in the course of domestic discussions
Who the Stormonts were he could not recall that he had ever learned but his mother had been very clear indeed about their superiority to the usual ruck of people
He would ask his sister whether she knew anything about them
In the meantime there was no denying that Stormont was a finesounding name
He reflected that it was his own middle nameand on the instant fancy engraved for him a cardplate on which appeared the legendMr Stormont Thorpe
It was an inspiration
Joel he had not used for so many years that now after six months familiarity with it on his sisters lips he could not get accustomed to it
The colourless and noncommittal style of J S Thorpe under which he had lived so long had been well enough for the term of his exilethe weary time of obscure toil and suspense
But now in this sunburst of smiling fortune when he had achieved the right to a name of distinctionhere it was ready to his hand
A fleeting question as to whether he should carry the J along as an initial put itself to his mind
He decided vigorously against it
He had always had a prejudice against men who in the transatlantic phrase parted either their hair or their names in the middle
He had made his unheeding way past the house to the beginning of the avenue of trees which he remembered from the previous evenings drive
To his right an open space of roadway led off in the direction of the stables
As he hesitated in momentary doubt which course to take the sound of hoofs in the avenue caught his ear and he stood still
In a moment there came into view round a curve in the leafy distance two horses with riders advancing at a brisk canter
Soon he perceived that the riders were ladies they drew rein as they approached him and then it was to be seen that they were the pair he had judged to be such close friends last nightLady Cressage and the daughter of the house
They smiled and nodded down at him as he lifted his cap and bowed
Their cheeks were glowing and their eyes sparkling with the exhilaration of their ride
Even the Hon
Winifred looked comely and distinguished in his eyes under the charm of this heightened vivacity
She seemed to carry herself better in the saddle than she did out of it the sweep of her habit below the stirrup lent dignity to her figure
But her companion whose big chestnut mount was pacing slowly toward the steppingblockhow should he bring within the compass of thought the impressions he had had of her as she passed
There seemed to have been no memory in his mind to prepare him for the beauty of the picture she had made
Slender erect exquisitelytailored she had gone by like some queen in a pageant gracious yet unapproachable
He stared after her mutely bewildered at the effect she produced upon himuntil he saw that a groom had run from the stableyard and was helping the divinity to dismount
The angry thought that he might have done this himself rose within himbut there followed swiftly enough the answering conviction that he lacked the courage
He did not even advance to proffer his services to the other young lady while there was still time
The truth was he admitted ruefully to himself they unnerved him
He had talked freely enough to them or rather to the company of which they made part the previous evening
There had been an hour or more indeed before the party broke up in which he had borne the lions share of the talkand they had appeared as frankly entertained as the others
In fact when he recalled the circle of faces to which he had addressed his monologue of reminiscencescurious experiences and adventures in Java and the Argentine in Brazil and the Antilles and Mexico and the far Westit was in the face of Lady Cressage that he seemed to discern the most genuine interest
Why should she frighten him then by daylight
The whimsical theory that the wine at dinner had given him a spurious courage occurred to him
He shrugged his shoulders at it and with his hands in his pockets turned toward the stables
The stableyard is from some points of view the prettiest thing about Hadlow
There is a big uneven grassgrown space in the centre of which from a slight mound springs an aged oak of tremendous girth and height
All around this enclosure are buildings of the same pale yellowish brick as the mansion itself but quaintly differing one from another in design and size
Stables carriagehouses kennels a laundry a brewery and half a dozen structures the intention of which is now somewhat uncertainsome flattopped some gabled others with turrets or massive grouped chimneys or overhanging timbered upper storiesform round this unkempt shadowed green a sort of village with a communal individuality of its own
A glance shows its feudal relation to and dependence upon the great house behind which it nestles some of the backkitchens and offices of this great house indeed straggle out till they meet and merge themselves into this quadrangle
None the less it presents to the enquiring gaze a specific character of as old a growth one might think as the oak itself
Here servants have lived it may be since man first learned the trick of setting his foot on his brothers neck
Plainly enough the monks servants lived and worked here half the buildings on the side nearest the house belong to their time and one of them still bears a partiallydefaced coat of arms that must have belonged to an Abbot
And when lay lord succeeded cleric only the garb and vocabulary of servitude were altered in this square
Its population crossed themselves less and worked much harder but they remained in a world of their own adjacent aud subject to the world of their masters yet separated from it by oh
such countless and unthinkable distances
Thorpe sauntered along the side of the stables
He counted three men and a boy who visibly belonged to this department
The dogcart of the previous evening had been run out upon the brickpavement which drained the stables and glistened with expensive smartness now beneath the sponge of one of the hostlers
Under cover he discerned two other carriages and there seemed to be at least half a dozen horses
The men who in the half gloom of the looseboxes were busy grooming these animals made a curious whistling noise as they worked
Everybody in the yard touched a forelock to him as he passed
From this quaint oldworld enclosure he wandered at his leisure through an open gate in the wall at the back into the gardens behind the house
There was not much in the way of flowers to look at but he moved about quite unconscious of any deprivation
A cluster of greenhouses massed against the southern side of the mansion attracted his listless fancy and he walked toward what appeared to be an entrance to them
The door was locked but he found another further on which opened to his hand
The air was very hot and moist inside and the place was so filled with broadleaved umbrageous tropical plants that he had to stoop to make his way through to the end
The next house had a more tolerable atmosphere and contained some blossoms to which he gave momentary attention
In the third house through the glassdoor he could see a manevidently a gardenerlifting some pots to a shelf overhead
The thought occurred to him that by entering into conversation with this man he might indirectly obtain a hint as to the usual breakfasthour at Hadlow
It was now nearly ten oclock and he was getting very hungry
Would they not ring a bell or sound a gong or something
he wondered
Perhaps there had been some such summons and he had not heard it
It might be the intelligent thing for him to return to the house at all events and sit in the hall where the servants could see him in case the meal was in progress
Looking idly through the glass at the gardener meanwhile it suddenly dawned upon him that the face and figure were familiar
He stared more intently at the man casting about in his memory for a clue to his identity
It came to him that the person he had in mind was a fellow named Gafferson who had kept an impoverished and downattheheels sort of hotel and general store on the road from Belize to Boon Town in British Honduras
Yes it undoubtedly was Gafferson
What on earth was he doing here
Thorpe gave but brief consideration to this problem
It was of more immediate importance to recall the circumstances of his contact with the man
He had made Gaffersons poor shanty of an hotel his headquarters for the better part of a monththe base of supplies from which he made numerous prospecting tours into the mountains of the interior
Had he paid his bill on leaving
Yes there was no doubt about that
He could even recall a certain pity for the unbusinesslike scale of charges and the lack of perception of opportunity which characterized the bill in question
He remembered now his impression that Gafferson would never do any good
It would be interesting to know what kind of an impression he in turn had produced on his thriftless host
At any rate there was no good reason why he should not find out
He opened the door and went in
The gardener barely looked up from his occupation and drew aside to let the newcomer pass with no sign of a gesture toward his cap
Thorpe halted and tried to look at the pots on the staging as if he knew about such things
What are you doing
he asked in the tentative tone of one who is in no need of information but desires to be affable
Drying off the first lot of gloxinias answered the other
Some people put em on their sides but I like em upright close to the glass
It stands to reason if you think about it
Why certainly said Thorpe with conviction
In his mind he contrasted the independence of Gaffersons manner with the practised servility of the stableyard and thought that he liked itand then was not so sure
He perceived that there was no recognition of him
The gardener as further desultory conversation about his work progressed looked his interlocutor full in the face but with a placid sheeplike gaze which seemed to be entirely insensible to variations in the human species
How did you ever get back here to England
Thorpe was emboldened to ask at last
In comment upon the others stare of puzzled enquiry he went on Youre Gafferson arent you
I thought so
When I last saw you you were running a sort of halfway house tother side of Belize
That was in 90
Gaffersona thickset squat man of middle age with a straggling reddish beardturned upon him a tranquil but uninformed eye
I suppose you would have been stopping at Government House he remarked
That was in Sir Roger Goldsworthys time
They used to come out often to see my flowers
And so you remembered my name
I suppose it was because of the Gaffersoniana hybrids
There was a good bit in the papers about them last spring
Thorpe nodded an assent which it seemed better not to put into words
Well it beats all he mused aloud
Why man theres gold in those mountains
You had an inside track on prospecting placed as you were
And theres cocoaand some day theyll coin money in rubber too
All that countrys waiting for is better communications
And you were on the spot and knew all the lay of the landand yet here you are back in England getting so much a month for messing about in the mud
He saw swiftly that his reflections had carried him beyond his earlier limit and with rapidity decided upon frankness
No I wasnt in the Governors outfit at all
I was looking for gold thenwith occasionally an eye on rubber
I stopped at your place
Dont you remember me
My names Thorpe
I had a beard then
Why man you and one of your niggers were with me three or four days once up on the ridge beyond the Burnt Hillswhy you remember the nigger was from San Domingo and he was forever bragging about the San Domingo peppers and saying those on the mainland hadnt enough strength to make a baby wrinkle his nose and you found a pepper coming through the swamp and you tipped me the wink and you handed that pepper to the nigger and it damned near killed him
Hell
You must remember that
That would have been the Chavica pertusum said Gafferson thoughtfully
He seemed to rouse himself to an interest in the story itself with some difficulty
YesI remember it he admitted finally
I shouldnt have known you though
Im the worst in the world about remembering people
It seems to be growing on me
I notice that when I go up to London to the shows I dont remember the men that I had the longest talks with the time before
Once you get wrapped up in your flowers youve got no room in your head for anything elsethats the way of it
Thorpe considered him with a ruminating eye
So this is the sort of thing you really like eh
Youd rather be doing this eh
than making your pile in logwood and mahogany out there or floating a gold mine
Gafferson answered quite simply I wasnt the kind to ever make a pile
I got led into going out there when I was a youngster and there didnt seem to be any good in trying to get back but I wasnt making more than a bare living when you were there and after that I didnt even do that much
It took me a good many years to find out what my real fancy was
I hated my hotel and my store but I was crazy about my garden
Finally an American gentleman came along one day and he put up at my place and he saw that I was as near ruined as they make em and he says to me Youre no good to run a hotel nor yet a store and this aint your country for a cent
What youre born for is to grow flowers
You cant afford to do it here because nobodyll pay you for it but you gather up your seeds and roots and so on and come along with me to Atlanta Georgia and Ill put fat on your bones
Thats what he said to me and I took him at his word and I was with him two years and then I thought Id like to come to England and since then Ive worked my way up here till now I take a Royal Horticultural medal regular and theres a clematis with salmoncoloured bars thatll be in the market next spring thats named after my master
And what could I ask more n that
Quite right said Thorpe
What time do they have breakfast here
The gardeners round phlegmatic florid countenance had taken on a mild glow of animation during his narrative
It relapsed into lethargy at the advent of this new topic
It seems to me they eat at all hours he said
But if you want to see his Lordship he went on considering about noon would be your best time
See his Lordship
repeated Thorpe with an impatient grin
Why Im a guest here in the house
All I want is something to eat
A guest Gafferson repeated in turn slowly
There was nothing unpleasant in the intonation and Thorpes sharp glance failed to detect any trace of offensive intention in his companions fatuous visage
Yet it seemed to pass between the two men that Gafferson was surprised and that there were abundant grounds for his surprise
Why yes said Thorpe with as much nonchalance as he could summon your master is one of my directors
Ive taken a fancy to him and Im going to make a rich man of him
He was keen about my seeing his place here and kept urging me to come and so finally Ive got away over Sunday to oblige him
By the wayI shall buy an estate in the country as soon as the right thing offers and I shall want to set up no end of gardens and greenhouses and all that
I see that I couldnt come to a better man than you for advice
I daresay Ill put the whole arrangement of it in your hands
Youd like that wouldnt you
Whatever his Lordship agrees to the gardener replied sententiously
He turned to the staging and took up one of the pots
Thorpe swung on his heel and moved briskly toward the further door which he could see opened upon the lawn
He was conscious of annoyance with this moonfaced dawdling Gafferson who had been afforded such a splendid chance of profiting by an old acquaintanceshipit might even be called as things went in Honduras a friendshipand who had so clumsily failed to rise to the situation
The bitter thought of going back and giving him a halfcrown rose in Thorpes inventive mind and he paused for an instant his hand on the doorknob to think it over
The gratuity would certainly put Gafferson in his place but then the spirit in which it was offered would be wholly lost on his dull brain
And moreover was it so certain that he would take it
He had not said sir once and he had talked about medals with the pride of a scientist
The rules were overwhelmingly against a gardener rejecting a tip of course but if there was no more than one chance in twenty of it Thorpe decided that he could not afford the risk
He quitted the greenhouse with resolution and directed his steps toward the front of the mansion
As he entered the hall a remarkably tuneful and resonant chime filled his ears with novel music
He looked and saw that a whitecapped neatlyclad domestic standing with her back to him beside the newelpost of the stairs was beating out the tune with two padded sticks upon some strips of metal ranged on a stand of Indian workmanship
The sound was delightful but even more so was the implication that it betokened breakfast
With inspiration he drew forth the halfcrown which he had been fingering in his pocket and gave it to the girl as she turned
Thats the kind of concert I like he declared bestowing the patronage of a jovial smile upon her pleased and comely face
Show me the way to this breakfast that youve been serenading about
Out in the greenhouse meanwhile Gafferson continued to regard blankly the shrivelled fatty leaves of the plant he had taken up
Thorpe he said aloud as if addressing the tabid gloxiniaThorpeyesI remember his initialsJ S Thorpe
Now whos the man that told me about him
and what was it he told me
CHAPTER VII THE experiences of the breakfast room were very agreeable indeed
Thorpe found himself the only man present and after the first few minutes of embarrassment at this discovery it filled him with surprised delight to note how perfectly he was at his ease
He could never have imagined himself seated with four ladies at a tablethree of them moreover ladies of titleand doing it all so well
For one thing the ladies themselves had a morning manner so to speak which differed widely from the impressions he had had of their deportment the previous evening
They seemed now to be as simple and fresh and natural as the unadorned frocks they wore
They listened with an air of goodfellowship to him when he spoke they smiled at the right places they acted as if they liked him and were glad of his company
The satisfied conviction that he was talking well and behaving well accompanied him in his progress through the meal
His confession at the outset of his great hunger and of the sinister apprehensions which had assailed him in his loitering walk about the place proved a most fortuitous beginning after that they were ready to regard everything he said as amusing
Oh when were by ourselves the kindly little old hostess explained to him my daughter and I breakfast always at nine
That was our hour yesterday morning for example
But when my son is here then its farewell to regularity
We put breakfast back till ten then as a kind of compromise between our own early habits and his lack of any sort of habits
Why we do it I couldnt saybecause he never comes down in any event
He sleeps so well at Hadlowand you know in town he sleeps very ill indeedand so we dont dream of complaining
Were only too gladfor his sake
And Balder commented the sister hes as bad the other way
He gets up at some unearthly hour and has his tea and a sandwich from the stillroom and goes off with his rod or his gun or the dogs and we never see him till luncheon
Ive been on the point of asking so many times Miss Madden interposedis Balder a family name or is it after the Viking in Matthew Arnolds poem
It was his fathers choice Lady Plowden made answer
I think the Viking explanation is the right oneit certainly isnt in either family
I cant say that it attracted me muchat first you know
Oh but it fits him so splendidly said Lady Cressage
He looks the part as they say
I always thought it was the best of all the soldier namesand you have only to look at him to see that he was predestined for a soldier from his cradle
I wish the Sandhurst people would have a good long look at him then put in the mother with earnestness underlying the jest of her tone
The poor boy will never pass those exams in the world
It IS ridiculous as his father always said
If there ever was a man who was made for a soldier its Balder
Hes a gentleman and hes connected by tradition with the Army and hes mad about everything militaryand surely hes as clever as anybody else at everything except that wretched matter of books and even there its only a defect of memoryand yet that suffices to prevent his serving his Queen
And all over England there are young gentlemen like thatthe very pick of the huntingfields strong and brave as lions fit to lead men anywhere the very men England wants to have fighting her battlesand they cant get places in the Army becausewhat was it Balder came to grief over last timebecause they cant remember whether its Ispahan or Teheran thats the capital of Persia
They are the fine old sort that would go and capture both places at the point of the bayonetand find out their names afterwardbut it seems thats not what the Army wants nowadays
What is desired now is superior clerks and secretaries and professors of languagesand much good they will do us when the time of trouble comes
Then you think the purchasesystem was better
asked the American lady
It always seemed to me that that must have worked so curiously
Prefer it
said Lady Plowden
A thousand times yes
My husband made one of the best speeches in the debate on itone do I sayfirst and last he must have made a dozen of them
If anything could have kept the House of Lords firm in the face of the wretched Radical outcry it would have been those speeches
He pointed out all the evils that would follow the change
You might have called it propheticthe way he foresaw what would happen to Balderor not Balder in particular of course but that whole class of young gentlemen
As he said you have only to ask yourself what kind of people the lower classes naturally look up to and obey and follow
Will they be ordered about by a man simply because he knows Greek and Latin and Hebrew
Do they respect the village schoolmaster for example on account of his learning
Not in the very slightest
On the contrary they regard him with the greatest contempt
The man they will serve is the man whose birth gives him the right to command them or else the man with money in his pockets to make it worth their while
These two are the only leaders they understand
And if thats true here in England in times of peace among our own people how much truer must it be of our soldiers away from England in a time of war
But mamma the Hon
Winifred intervened dont you see how badly that might work nowadays
now that the good families have so little money and all the fortunes are in the hands of stockjobbing peopleand so on
It would be THEIR sons who would buy all the commissionsand Im sure Balder wouldnt get on at all with that lot
Lady Plowden answered with decision and great promptness
You see so little of the world Winnie dear that you dont get very clear ideas of its movements
The people who make fortunes in England are every whit as important to its welfare as those who inherit names and individually Im sure they are often much more deserving
Every generation sniffs at its nouveaux riches but by the next they have become merged in the aristocracy
It isnt a new thing in England at all
It has always been that way
Twothirds of the peerage have their start from a wealthy merchant or some other person who made a fortune
They are really the backbone of England
You should keep that always in mind
Of courseI see what you meanWinnie replied her dark cheek flushing faintly under the tacit reproof
She had passed her twentyfifth birthday but her voice had in it the docile selfrepression of a schoolgirl
She spoke with diffident slowness her gaze fastened upon her plate
Of coursemy grandfather was a lawyerand your point is that merchantsand others who make fortuneswould be the same
Precisely said Lady Plowden
And do tell us Mr Thorpeshe turned toward where he sat at her right and beamed at him over her spectacles with the air of having been wearied with a conversation in which he bore no partis it really true that social discontent is becoming more marked in America even than it is with us in England
Im not an American you know he reminded her
I only know one or two sections of the countryand those only as a stranger
You should ask Miss Madden
Me
said Celia
Oh I havent come up for my examinations yet
Im like BalderIm preparing
What I should like Mr Thorpe to tell us suggested Lady Cressage mildly is about the flowers in the tropicsin Java for example or some of the West Indies
One hears such marvelous tales about them
Speaking of flowers Thorpe suddenly decided to mention the fact I met out in one of the greenhouses here this morning an old acquaintance of mine the gardener Gafferson
The last time I saw him he was running the worst hotel in the world in the worst country in the world out in British Honduras
But hes a wonderful gardener said Lady Cressage
Hes a magician he can do what he likes with plants
Its rather a hobby of mineor used to beand I never saw his equal
Thorpe told them about Gafferson in that forlorn environment on the Belize road and his success in making them laugh drew him on to other pictures of the droll side of life among the misfits of adventure
The ladies visibly dallied over their teacups to listen to him the charm of having them all to himself and of holding them in interested entertainment by his discoursethese ladies of supremely refined associations and positionseemed to provide an inspiration of its own
He could hear that his voice was automatically modulating itself to their critical ears
His language was producing itself with as much delicacy of selection as if it came out of a bookand yet preserving the savour of quaint outlandish idiom which his listeners clearly liked
Upon the instant when Lady Plowdens gathering of skirts and glance across the table warned him that they were to rise he said deliberately to himself that this had been the most enjoyable episode of his whole life
There were cigar boxes on the fine old oak mantel out in the hall and Winnie indicated them to him with the obvious suggestion that he was expected to smoke
He looked her over as he lit his cigarwhere she stood spreading her hands above the blaze of the logs and concluded that she was much nicer upon acquaintance than he had thought
Her slight figure might not be beautiful but beyond doubt its lines were ladylike
The same extenuating word applied itself in his mind to her thin and swarthy though distinguished features
They bore the stamp of caste and so did the way she looked at one through her eyeglasses from under those overheavy black eyebrows holding her head a little to one side
Though it was easy enough to guess that she had a spirit of her own her gentle almost anxious deference to her mother had shown that she had it under admirable control
He had read about her in a peerage at his sisters bookshop the previous day
Unfortunately it did not give her age but that was not so important after all
She was styled Honourable
She was the daughter of one Viscount and the sister of another
Her grandfather had been an Earl and the book had shown her to possess a bewildering number of relationships among titled folks
All this was very interesting to himand somewhat suggestive
Vague shapeless hints at projects rose in his brain as he looked at her
Im afraid you think my brother has odd notions of entertaining his guests she remarked to him over her shoulder
The other ladies had not joined them
Oh Im all right he protested cordially
I should hate to have him put himself out in the slightest
Upon consideration he added I suppose he has given up the idea of shooting today
I think not she answered
The keeper was about this morning that isand he doesnt often come unless they are to go out with the guns
I suppose you are very fond of shooting
WellIve done somein my time Thorpe replied cautiously
It did not seem necessary to explain that he had yet to fire his first gun on English soil
Its a good many years he went on since I had the time and opportunity to do much at it
I think the last shooting I did was alligators
You hit em in the eye you know
But what kind of a hand I shall make of it with a shotgun I havent the least idea
Is the shooting round I here pretty good
I dont think its anything remarkable
Plowden says my brother Balder kills all the birds off every season
Balders by way of being a crackshot you know
There are some pheasants though
We saw them flying when we were out this morning
Thorpe wondered if it would be possible to consult her upon the question of apparel
Clearly he ought to make some difference in his garb yet the mental vision of himself in those old Mexican clothes revealed itself now as ridiculously impossible
He must have been out of his mind to have conceived anything so preposterous as rigging himself out among these polished people like a cowpuncher down on his luck
I wonder when your brother will expect to start he began uneasily
Perhaps I ought to go and get ready
Ah here comes his man remarked the sister
A roundfaced smoothmannered youngsterwhom Thorpe discovered to be wearing cordbreeches and leather leggings as he descended the stairsadvanced toward him and prefaced his message by the invariable salutation
His Lordship will be down sir in ten minutesand he hopes youll be ready sir the valet said
Send Pangbourn to this gentlemans room Miss Winnie bade him and with a gesture of comprehensive submission he went away
The calm readiness with which she had provided a solution for his difficulties impressed Thorpe greatly
It would never have occurred to him that Pangbourn was the answer to the problem of his clothes yet how obvious it had been to her
These old families did something more than fill their houses with servants they mastered the art of making these servants an integral part of the machinery of existence
Fancy having a man to do all your thinking about clothes for you and then dress you into the bargain
Oh it was all splendid
It seems that were going shooting Thorpe found himself explaining a few moments later in his bedroom to the attentive Pangbourn
He decided to throw himself with frankness upon the domestics resourceful goodfeeling
I havent brought anything for shooting at all
Somehow I got the idea we were going to do rough riding insteadand so I fetched along some old Mexican ridingclothes that make me feel more at home in the saddle than anything else would
You know how fond a man gets of old loose things like that
But about this shootingI want you to fix me out
What do I need
Just some breeches and leggings eh
You can manage them for me cant you
Pangbourn could and didand it was upon his advice that the Mexican jacket was utilized to complete the outfit
Its shape was beyond doubt uncommon but it had big pockets and it looked like business
Thorpe as he glanced up and down his image in the tall mirror of the wardrobe felt that he must kill a large number of birds to justify the effect of pitiless proficiency which this jacket lent to his appearance
We will find a cap below sir Pangbourn announced with serenity and Thorpe who had been tentatively fingering the big flaring sombrero thrust it back upon its peg as if it had proved too hot to handle
Downstairs in the hall there was more waiting to be done and there was nobody now to bear him company
He lit another cigar tried on various caps till he found a leathern one to suit him and then dawdled about the room and the adjoining conservatory for what seemed to him more than half an hour
This phase of the aristocratic routine he felt did not commend itself so warmly to him as did some others
Everybody else however seemed to regard it as so wholly a matter of course that Plowden should do as he liked that he forbore formulating a complaint even to himself
At last this noblemans valet descended the stairs once more
His Lordship will be down very shortly now sir he declaredand will you be good enough to come into the gunroom sir and see the keeper
Thorpe followed him through a doorway under the staircasethe existence of which he had not suspectedinto a barelooking apartment fitted like a pantry with shelves
After the semigloom of the hall it was almost glaringly lighted
The windows and another door opened he saw upon a court connected with the stableyard
By this entrance no doubt had come the keeper a small brownfaced brownclothed man of mature years with the strap of a pouch over his shoulder who stood looking at the contents of the shelves
He mechanically saluted Thorpe in turn and then resumed his occupation
There were numerous gun cases on the lower shelf and many boxes and bags above
Did his Lordship say what gun
the keeper demanded of the valet
He had a brighteyed intent glance and his tone conveyed a sense of some broad impersonal outofdoors disdain for liveried housemen
The valet standing behind Thorpe shrugged his shoulders and eloquently shook his head
Do you like an ammerless sir
the keeper turned to Thorpe
To his intense humiliation Thorpe could not make out the meaning of the query
Oh anythingll do for me he said awkwardly smiling
Its years since Ive shotI daresay one gunll be quite the same as another to me
He felt the knowing bright eyes of the keeper taking all his measurements as a sportsman
Youd do best with B sir I fancy the functionary decided at last and his way of saying it gave Thorpe the notion that B must be the weapon that was reserved for schoolboys
He watched the operation of putting the gun together and then took it and laid it over his arm and followed the valet out into the hall again in dignified silence
To the keepers remarkMr Balder has its mate with him today sir he gave only a restrained nod
There were even now whole minutes to wait before Lord Plowden appeared
He came down the stairs then with the brisk rather impatient air of a busy man whose plans are embarrassed by the unpunctuality of others
He was fully attired hobnailed shoes leggings leather coat and cap gloves scarf round his throat and alland he behaved as if there was not a minute to lose
He had barely time to shake perfunctorily the hand Thorpe offered him and utter an absentminded How are you this morning
To the valet who hurried forward to open the outer door bearing his masters gun and a campstool he said reproachfully We are very late today Barnes
They went out and began striding down the avenue of trees at such a pace that the keeper and his following of small boys and dogs who joined them near the road were forced into a trot to keep up with it
Thorpe had fancied somehow that a days shooting would afford exceptional opportunities for quiet and intimate talk with his host but he perceived very soon that this was not to be the case
They walked together for half a mile it is true along a rural byeroad first and then across some fields but the party was close at their heels and Plowden walked so fast that conversation of any sort save an occasional remark about the birds and the covers between him and the keeper was impracticable
The Hon
Balder suddenly turned up in the landscape leaning against a gate set in a hedgerow and their course was deflected toward him but even when they came up to him the expedition seemed to gain nothing of a social character
The few curt words that were exchanged as they halted here to distribute cartridges and hold brief consultation bore exclusively upon the subject in hand
The keeper assumed now an authority which Thorpe breathing heavily over the unwonted exercise and hoping for nothing so much as that they would henceforth take things easy thought intolerable
He was amazed that the two brothers should take without cavil the arbitrary orders of this elderly peasant
He bade Lord Plowden proceed to a certain point in one direction and that nobleman followed by his valet with the gun and the stool set meekly off without a word
Balder with equal docility vaulted the gate and moved away down the lane at the bidding of the keeper
Neither of them had intervened to mitigate the destiny of their guest or displayed any interest as to what was going to become of him
Thorpe said to himself that he did not like thisand though afterward when he had also climbed the gate and taken up his station under a clump of trees at the autocrats behest he strove to soothe his ruffled feelings by the argument that it was probably the absolutely correct deportment for a shooting party his mind remained unconvinced
Moreover in parting from him the keeper had dropped a blunt injunction about firing up or down the lane the tone even more than the matter of which nettled him
To cap all when he presently ventured to stroll about a little from the spot on which he had been planted he caught a glimpse against the skyline of the distant Lord Plowden comfortably seated on the stool which his valet had been carrying
It seemed to Thorpe at that moment that he had never wanted to sit down so much before in his lifeand he turned on his heel in the wet grass with a grunt of displeasure
This mood vanished utterly a few moments later
The remote sounds had begun to come to him of boys shouting and dogs barking in the recesses of the strip of woodland which the lane skirted and at these he hastened back to his post
It did not seem to him a good place and when he heard the reports of guns to right and left of him and nothing came his way he liked it less than ever it had become a matter of offended pride with him however to relieve the keeper of no atom of the responsibility he had taken upon himself
If Lord Plowdens guest had no sport the blame for it should rest upon Lord Plowdens overarrogant keeper
Then a noise of a different character assailed his ears punctuated as it were by distant boyish cries of mark
These cries and the buzzing sound as of clockwork gone wrong which they accompanied and heralded became all at once a most urgent affair of his own
He strained his eyes upon the horizon of the thicketand as if by instinct the gun sprang up to adjust its sight to this eager gaze and followed automatically the thundering course of the big bird and then taking thought to itself leaped ahead of it and fired
Thorpes first pheasant reeled in the air described a somersault and fell like a plummet
He stirred not a step but reloaded the barrel with a hand shaking for joy
From where he stood he could see the dead bird there could never have been a cleaner kill
In the warming glow of his satisfaction in himself there kindled a new liking of a different sort for Plowden and Balder
He owed to them at this belated hour of his life a novel delight of indescribable charm
There came to him from the woods the shrill bucolic voice of the keeper admonishing a wayward dog
He was conscious of even a certain tenderness for this keeperand again the cry of mark
rose strenuously addressed to him
Half an hour later the wood had been cleared and Thorpe saw the rest of the party assembling by the gate
He did not hurry to join them but when Lord Plowden appeared he sauntered slowly over gun over arm with as indifferent an air as he could simulate
It pleased him tremendously that no one had thought it worth while to approach the rendezvous by way of the spot he had covered
His eye took instant stock of the game carried by two of the boys their combined prizes were eight birds and a rabbit and his heart leaped within him at the count
Well Thorpe
asked Plowden pleasantly
The smell of gunpowder and the sight of stained feathers had co operated to brighten and cheer his mood
I heard you blazing away in great form
Did you get anything
Thorpe strove hard to give his voice a careless note
Let some of the boys run over he said slowly
There are nine birds within sight and there are two or three in the bushesbut they may have got away
Gad
said Balder
Magnificent
was his brothers commentand Thorpe permitted himself the luxury of a longdrawn beaming sigh of triumph
The roseate colouring of this triumph seemed really to tint everything that remained of Thorpes visit
He set down to it without hesitation the visible augmentation of deference to him among the servants
The temptation was very great to believe that it had affected the ladies of the house as well
He could not say that they were more gracious to him but certainly they appeared to take him more for granted
In a hundred little ways he seemed to perceive that he was no longer held mentally at arms length as a stranger to their caste
Of course his own restored selfconfidence could account for much of this but he clung to the whimsical conceit that much was also due to the fact that he was the man of the pheasants
Sunday was bleak and stormy and no one stirred out of the house
He was alone again with the ladies at breakfast and during the long day he was much in their company
It was like no other day he had ever imagined to himself
On the morrow in the morning train by which he returned alone to town his mind roved luxuriously among the fragrant memories of that day
He had been so perfectly at homeand in such a home
There were some things which came uppermost again and againbut of them all he dwelt most fixedly upon the recollection of moving about in the greenhouses and conservatories with that tall stately fair Lady Cressage for his guide and watching her instead of the flowers that she pointed out
Of what she had told him not a syllable stuck in his mind but the music of the voice lingered in his ears
And she is old Kervicks daughter
he said to himself more than once
CHAPTER VIII IT may be that every other passenger in that morning train to London nursed either a silent rage or declaimed aloud to fellowsufferers in indignation at the time consumed in making what by the map should be so brief a journey
In Thorpes own compartment men spoke with savage irony of cyclists alleged to be passing them on the road and exchanged dark prophecies as to the novelties in imbecility and helplessness which the line would be preparing for the Christmas holidays
The old joke about people who had gone travelling years before and were believed to be still lost somewhere in the recesses of Kent revived itself amid gloomy approbation
The still older discussion as to whether the South Eastern or the Brighton was really the worst followed naturally in its wake and occupied its accustomed halfhourcomplicated however upon this occasion by the chance presence of a loquacious stranger who said he lived on the ChathamandDover and who rejected boisterously the idea that any other railway could be half so bad
The intrusion of this outsider aroused instant resentment and the champions of the South Eastern and the Brighton having piled up additional defenses in the shape of personal recollections of delay and mismanagement quite beyond belief made a combined attack upon the newcomer
He was evidently incapable their remarks implied of knowing a bad railway when he saw one
To suggest that the characterless and inoffensive ChathamandDover so commonplace in its tame virtues was to be mentioned in the same breath with the daringly inventive and resourceful malefactors whose rendezvous was London Bridge showed either a weak mind or a corrupt heart
Did this man really live on the Dover line at all
Angry countenances plainly reflected the doubt
But to Thorpe the journey seemed short enoughalmost too short
The conversation interested him not at all if he had ever known the Southern lines apart they were all one to him now
He looked out of the window and could have sworn that he thought of nothing but the visit from which he was returning
When he alighted at Cannon Street however it was to discover that his mind was full of a large new carefullyprepared project
It came to him readymade and practically complete as he stood on the platform superintending the porters efforts to find his bags
He turned it over and over in his thoughts in the hansom more to familiarize himself with its details than to add to them
He left the cab to wait for him at the mouth of a little alley which delves its way into Old Broad Street through towering walls of commercial buildings old and new
Colin Semple was happily in his officea congeries of small huddled rooms dry and dirty with age which had a doorway of its own in a corner of the courtand Thorpe pushed on to his room at the end like one who is assured of both his way and his welcome
The broker was standing beside a desk dictating a letter to a clerk who sat at it and with only a nod to Thorpe he proceeded to finish this task
He looked more than once at his visitor as he did so in a preoccupied impersonal way
To the others notion he seemed the personification of businesswithout an ounce of distracting superfluous flesh upon his wiry tough little frame without a trace of unnecessary politeness or humour or sensibility of any sort
He was the machine perfected and fined down to absolute essentials
He could understand a joke if it was useful to him to do so
He could drink and even smoke cigarettes with a natural air if these exercises seemed properly to belong to the task he had in hand
Thorpe did not conceive him doing anything for the mere human reason that he liked to do it
There was more than a touch of what the rustic calls ginger in his hair and closelycropped pointed beard and he had the complementary florid skin
His eyesnotably direct confident eyeswere of a grey which had in it more brown than blue
He wore a black frockcoat buttoned close and his linen produced the effect of a conspicuous whiteness
He turned as the clerk left the room and let his serious thin lips relax for an instant as a deferred greeting
Well
he asked impassively
Have you got a quarterofanhour
asked Thorpe in turn
I want a talk with you
For answer Semple left the room
Returning after a minute or two he remarked Go ahead till were stopped and seated himself on the corner of the desk with the light inconsequence of a bird on a twig
Thorpe unbuttoned his overcoat laid aside his hat and seated himself
Ive worked out the whole scheme he began as if introducing the product of many sleepless nights cogitations
Im going to leave England almost immediatelygo on the Continent and loaf aboutIve never seen the Continent
Semple regarded him in silence
Well
he observed at last
You see the idea dont you
Thorpe demanded
The broker twitched his shoulders slightly
Go on he said
But the idea is everything protested the other
Weve been thinking of beginning the campaign straight awaybut the true game now is to lie lowsilent as the grave
I go away now dye see
Nothing particular is said about it of course but in a month or two somebody notices that Im not about and he happens to mention it to somebody elseand so there gets to be the impression that things havent gone well with me dye see
On the same plan I let all the clerks at my office go
The Secretaryll come round every once in a while to get letters of course and perhaps hell keep a boy in the front office for show but practically the placell be shut up
Thatll help out the general impression that Ive gone to pieces
Now dye see
Its the Special Settlement youre thinking of commented Semple
Of course
The fellows that were going to squeeze would move heaven and hell to prevent our getting that Settlement if they got wind of what was going on
The only weak point in our game is just there
Absolutely everything hangs on the Settlement being granted
Naturally then our play is to concentrate everything on getting it granted
We dont want to raise the remotest shadow of a suspicion of what were up to till after were safe past that rock
So we go on in the way to attract the least possible attention
You or your jobber makes the ordinary application for a Special Settlement with your six signatures and so on and I go abroad quietly and the office is as good as shut up and nobody makes a peep about Rubber Consols and the thing works itself
You do see it dont you
I see well enough the things that are to be seen replied Semple with a certain brevity of manner
There was a sermon of my fathers that I remember and it had for its text We look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen
Thorpe pondering this for a moment nodded his head
Semple he said bringing his chair forward to the desk thats what Ive come for
I want to spread my cards on the table for you
I know the sum youve laid out already in working this thing
Well say that that is to be paid back to you as a separate transaction and well put that to one side
Now then leaving that out of consideration what do you think you ought to have out of the winnings when we pull the thing off
Mind Im not thinking of your 2000 vendors shares NoIm not thinking much of them either interposed Semple with a kind of dry significance
Oh theyll be all right Thorpe affirmed
He laughed unconsciously as he did so
No what I want to get at is your idea of what should come to you as a bonus when I scoop the board
Twenty thousand pounds said Semple readily
Thorpes slow glance brightened a trifle
I had thought thirty would be a fairer figure he remarked with an effort at simplicity
The broker put out his underlip
You will find people rather disposed to distrust a man who promises more than hes asked he remarked coldly
YesI know what you mean Thorpe hurried to say flushing awkwardly even though the remark was so undeserved but its in my nature
Im full of the notion of doing things for people that have done things for me
Thats the way Im built
Whyhe halted to consider the advisability of disclosing what he had promised to do for Lord Plowden and decided against itwhy without you what would the whole thing have been worth to me
Take one thing alonethe money for the applicationsI could have no more got at it than I could at the Crown Jewels in the Tower
Ive wondered since more than onceif you dont mind the questionhow did you happen to have so much ready money lying about
There are some Glasgow and Aberdeen folk who trust me to invest for them the broker explained
If they get five per cent
for the four months theyll be very pleased
And so I shall be very pleased to take thirty thousand instead of twentyif it presents itself to your mind in that way
You will give me a letter to that effect of course
Of course assented Thorpe
Write it now if you like
He pushed his chair forward closer to the desk and dipped a pen in the ink
What I want to do is this he said looking up
Ill make the promise for thirtytwo thousand and Ill get you to let me have two thousand in cash nowa personal advance
I shall need it if Im to hang about on the Continent for four months
I judge you think itll be four months before things materialize eh
The Special Settlement in the natural order of events would come shortly after the Christmas holidays
That is nearly three months
Then the work of taking fortnightly profits will beginand it is for you to say how long you allow that to go on
But about the two thousand pounds now Thorpe reminded him
I think I will do that in this way said Semple kicking his small legs nonchalantly
I will buy two thousand fullypaid shares of you for cash down NOT vendors shares you observeand then I will take your acknowledgment that you hold them for me in trust up to a given date
In that way I would not at all weaken your market and I would have a stake in the game
Your stakes pretty big already commented Thorpe tentatively
Its just a fancy of mine said the other with his first smile
I like to hold shares that are making sensational advances
It is very exciting
All right said Thorpe in accents of resignation
He wrote out two letters accepting the wording which Semple suggested from his perch on the desk and then the latter hopping down took the chair in turn and wrote a cheque
Do you want it open
he asked over his shoulder
Are you going to get it cashed at once
Nocross it said the other
I want it to go through my bankers
Itll warm their hearts toward me
I shant be going till the end of the week in any event
I suppose you know the Continent by heart
On the contrary very little indeed
Ive had business in Frankfort once and in Rotterdam once and in Paris twice
That is all
But dont you ever do anything for pleasure
Thorpe asked him as he folded the cheque in his pocketbook
Oh yesmany things responded the broker lightly
Its a pleasure for example to buy Rubber Consols at par
Oh if you call it buying said Thorpe and then softened his words with an apologetic laugh
I didnt tell you did I
Ive been spending Saturday and Sunday with Plowdenyou know the Lord Plowden on my Board
I know of him very well observed the Scotchman
Has he a place that he asks people down to then
That isnt the usual form with guineapigs
Ah but he isnt the guineapig variety at all Thorpe asserted warmly
Hes really a splendid fellowwith his little oddities like the rest of us of course but a decent chap all through
Place
I should think he HAD got a place
Its one of the swellest old countryhouses you ever sawolder than hell you knowand its kept up as if they had fifty thousand a year
Do you happen to know what his real income is supposed to be
Semple shook his head
He had taken his hat and was smoothing it deftly with the palm of his hand
I asked Thorpe went on because he had so much to say about his poverty
To hear him talk youd think the bailiffs were sitting on his doorstep
That doesnt prevent his having fast horses and servants all over the place and about the best shooting Ive seen in the South of England
As luck would have it I was in wonderful form
God
how I knocked the pheasants
A clerk showed his head at the door with a meaning gesture
I must go now said Semple briskly and led the way out to another room
He halted here and dismissed his caller with the brief injunction Dont go away without seeing me
It was the noonhour and the leastconsidered grades of the Citys slaves were in the streets on the quest for cheap luncheons
Thorpe noted the manner in which some of them studied the large bill of fare placarded beside a restaurant door the spectacle prompted him luxuriously to rattle the gold coins remaining in his pocket
He had been as anxious about pence as the hungriest of those poor devils only a week before
And now
He thrust up the door in the roof of the cab and bade the driver stop at his bank
Thence after some brief but very agreeable business and a hurried inspection of the Court section of a London Directory he drove to a telegraph station and despatched two messages
They were identical in terms
One sought General Kervick at his residencehe was in lodgings somewhere in the Hanover Square countryand the other looked for him at his club
Both begged him to lunch at the Savoy at two oclock
There was time and to spare now
Thorpe dismissed the cab at his hotelan unpretentious house in Craven Street and sent his luggage to his rooms
There were no letters for him on the board in the hallway and he sauntered up to the Strand
As by force of habit he turned presently into a sidestreet and stopped opposite the ancient bookshop of his family
In the bright yet mellow light of the sunny autumn noontide the blacks and roans and smoked drabs of the low old brick front looked more dingy to his eye than ever
It spoke of antiquity no doubt but it was a dismal and graceless antiquity of narrow purposes and niggling thrift
It was so little like the antiquity for example of Hadlow House that the two might have computed their age by the chronological systems of different planets
Although his sisters married name was Dabney and she had been sole proprietor for nearly a dozen years the sign over the doorway bore still its centuryold legend Thorpe Bookseller
He crossed the street and paused for a moment to run an eye over the books and placards exposed on either side of the entrance
A small boy guarded these wares and Thorpe considered him briefly with curious recollections of how much of his own boyhood had been spent on that very spot
The lad under observation had a loutish and sullen face its expression could not have been more devoid of intellectual suggestions if he had been posted in a Wiltshire field to frighten crows with a rattle instead of being set here in the highway of the worlds brainmovement an agent of students and philosophers
Thorpe wondered if in his time he could have looked such a vacant and sour young fool
Nono
That could not be
Boys were different in his dayand especially boys in bookshops
They read something and knew something of what they handled
They had some sort of aspirations fitful and vague as these might be to become in their time bookmen also
And in those days there still were bookmenwidelyinformed observant devoted old bookmenwho loved their trade and adorned it
Thorpe reflected that as he grew older he was the better able to apprehend the admirable qualities of that departed race of literatures servants
Indeed it seemed that he had never adequately realized before how proud a man might well be of descending from a line of such men
The thought struck him that very likely at this identical doorway two generations back a poor outattheelbows young lawstudent named Plowden had stood and turned over pages of books he could not dream of buying
Perhaps even he had ventured inside and deferentially picked acquaintance with the Thorpe of the period and got bookish advice and friendly counsel for nothing
It was of no real significance that the lawstudent grew to be Lord Chancellor and the bookseller remained a bookseller in the realm of actual values the Thorpes were as good as the Plowdens
A customer came out of the shop and Thorpe went in squeezing his way along the narrow passage between the tall rows of books to the small open space at the end
His sister stood here momentarily occupied at a high desk
She did not look up
WellI visited his Lordship all right
He announced his presence thus genially
I hope youre the better for it she remarked turning to him after a pause her emotionless plain face
Oh immensely he affirmed with robust jocularity
You should have seen the way they took to me
It was Mr
Thorpe here and Mr
Thorpe there all over the place
Ladies of title mind youall to myself at breakfast two days running
And such ladiesfiner than silk
Oh its clear as daylightI was intended for a fashionable career
She smiled in a faint passive way
Wellthey say better late than never you know
And after all IS it so very late
he said adopting her phrase as an expression of his thought
Im just turned forty and I feel like a boy
I was looking at that Peerage there the other dayand do you know Im sixteen years younger than the first Lord Plowden was when they made him a peer
Why he didnt even get into the House of Commons until he was sevenandforty
You seem to have the Plowden family on the brain she commented
I might have worse things
Youve no idea Lou how nice it all is
The mother Lady Plowdenwhy she made me feel as if I was at the very least a nephew of hers
And so simple and natural
She smiled at me and listened to me and said friendly things to mewhy just as anybody might have done
Youll just love her when you know her
Louisa laughed in his face
Dont be a fool Joel she adjured him with a flash of scornful mirth
He mingled a certain frowning impatience with the buoyancy of his smile
Why of course youll know her he protested
What nonsense youre thinking of
Do you suppose Im going to allow you to mess about here with secondhand almanacs and a sign in your window of threepence in the shilling discount for cash while Im a millionaire
Its too foolish Lou
You annoy me by supposing such a thing
Theres no good talking about it at all she observed after a little pause
It hasnt come off yet for one thing
And as I said the other night if you want to do things for the children thats another matter
Theyre of an age when they can learn whatever anybody chooses to teach them
Where are they now
he asked
Upon the instant another plan began to unfold itself in the background of his mind
Theyre both at Cheltenham though theyre at different places of course
I was recommended to send Julia thereone of our old customers is a Governor or whatever its calledand he got special terms for her
She was rather old you know to go to school but he arranged it very nicely for herand there is such a good boys college there it seemed the wisest thing to send Alfred too
Julia is to finish at Christmastimeand what Im going to do with her afterward is more than I know
Is she pretty
the uncle of Julia enquired
Shes very nice the mother answered with vague extenuation in her tone
I dont know about her looksshe varies so much
Sometimes I think shes prettyand then again I cant think it
Shes got good features and she holds herself well and shes very much the ladyrather too much I think sometimesbut it all depends upon what you call pretty
Shes not tall you know
She takes after her fathers family
The Dabneys are all little people
Thorpe seemed not to care about the Dabneys
And whats Alfred like
he asked
He wants to be an artist
There was a perceptible note of apprehension in the mothers confession
Wellwhy shouldnt heif hes got a bent that way
demanded Thorpe with reproof in his tone
Did you want him to be a shopkeeper
I should like to see him a doctor she replied with dignity
It was always my idea for him
Well its no goodeven as an idea he told her
Doctors are like parsonsthey cant keep up with the times
The age is outgrowing them
Only the fakirs in either profession get anything out of it nowadays
Its all mystery and sleightofhand and the confidence trickmedicine isand if you havent got just the right twist of the wrist youre not in it
But an artist stands on his merits
There is his workdone by his own hands
It speaks for itself
Theres no deceptionits easy enough to tell whether its good or bad
If the pictures are good people buy them
If theyre bad people dont buy them
Of course it wont matter to Alfred financially speaking whether his pictures sell well or not
But probably hed give it up if he didnt make a hit of it
I dont know that theres any crying need that he should do anything
My own idea for him perhaps would be the Army but I wouldnt dream of forcing it on him against his will
I had a bitter enough dose of that myself with father
Id try to guide a youngster yes and perhaps argue with him if I thought he was making a jack of himselfbut I wouldnt dictate
If Alfred thinks he wants to be an artist in Gods name let him go ahead
It can be made a gentlemanly tradeand the main thing is that he should be a gentleman
Louisa had listened to this discourse with apathetic patience
If you dont mind I dont know that I do she said when it was finished
Perhaps he wouldnt have made a good doctor hes got a very quick temper
He reminds me of fatheroh ever so much more than you do
He contradicts everything everybody says
He quite knows it all
But hes a good fellow isnt he
urged Thorpe
I mean hes got his likable points
Im going to be able to get along with him
I didnt get along with him very well the mother admitted reluctantly but I daresay with a man it would be different
You see his father was ill all those four years and Alfred hated the shop as bad as you did and perhaps in my worry I blamed him more than was fair
I want to be fair to him you know
But is he a gentleman
That puts it in a word Thorpe insisted
Oh mercy yes Louisa made ready answer
My only fear iswhether you wont find him too much of a gentleman
Thorpe knitted his brows
I only hope were talking about the same thing he said in a doubtful tone
Before she could speak he lifted his hand
Never mindI can see for myself in ten minutes more than you could tell me in a lifetime
Ive got a plan
Im going on the Continent in a few days time to stay for three or four months
Ive got nothing special to dojust to travel about and see things and kill timeI shall probably go to Italy and Switzerland and Paris and the Rhine and all sorts of placesand it occurred to me that Id take the two youngsters with me
I could get acquainted with them that way and theyd be company for me
Ive been lonesome so long it would feel good to have some of my own flesh and blood about meand I suppose theyd be tickled to death to go
Their schooling and board are paid for up to Christmas Mrs Dabney objected blankly
Bah
Thorpe prolonged the emphatic exclamation into something goodnatured and ended it with an abrupt laugh
What on earth difference does that make
I could go and buy their damned colleges and let the kids wear them for breastpins if I wanted to
You said the girl was going to quit at Christmas in any case
Wont she learn more in four months travelling about on the Continent than she would trotting around in her own tracks there at Cheltenham
And its even more important for the boy
Hes of an age when he ought to see something of the world and I ought to see something of him
Whatever hes going to do its time that he began getting his special start for it
He added upon a luminous afterthought  Perhaps his seeing the old Italian picture galleries and so on will cure him of wanting to be an artist
The mothers air displayed resigned acquiescence rather than conviction
Wellif you really think its best she began I dont know that I ought to object
Goodness knows I dont want to stand in their way
Ever since you sent that four hundred pounds it hasnt seemed as if they were my children at all
Theyve scarcely listened to me
And now you come and propose to take them out of my hands altogetherand all I can say isI hope you feel entirely justified
And so shall I write them to come home
When do you think of starting
Julia ought to have some travelling clothes
I can wait till you get her readyonly you must hurry up about it
Remembering something he took out his chequebook and spread it on the desk
I will give you back that thirty he said as he wrote and heres a hundred to get the youngsters ready
You wont waste any time will you
and if you want more tell me
A customer had entered the shop and Thorpe made it the occasion for leaving
His sister looking after her brother with the cheque in her hand was conscious of a thought which seemed to spell itself out in visible letters before her mental vision
Even now I dont believe in him the impalpable legend ran
CHAPTER IX GENERAL KERVICK was by habit a punctual man and Thorpe found him hovering carefully gloved and furcoated in the neighbourhood of the luncheonroom when he arrived
It indeed still lacked a few minutes of the appointed hour when they thus met and went in together
They were fortunate enough to find a small table out on the balcony sufficiently removed from any other to give privacy to their conversation
By tacit agreement the General ordered the luncheon speaking French to the waiter throughout
Divested of his imposing greatcoat he was seen to be a gentleman of meagre flesh as well as of small stature
He had the Roman nose narrow forehead bushing brows and sharplycut mouth and chin of a soldier grown old in the contemplation of portraits of the Duke of Wellington
His face and neck were of a dull reddish tint which seemed at first sight uniformly distributed one saw afterward that it approached pallor at the veined temples and ripened into purple in minute patches on the cheeks and the tip of the pointed nose
Against this flushed skin the closelycropped hair and small neatlywaxed moustache were very white indeed
It was a thin lined careworn face withal which in repose and particularly in profile produced an effect of dignified and philosophical melancholy
The Generals overprominent light blue eyes upon occasion marred this effect however by glances of a bold harsh character which seemed to disclose unpleasant depths below the correct surface
His manner with the waiters was abrupt and sharp but undoubtedly they served him very wellmuch better in truth than Thorpe had ever seen them serve anybody before
Thorpe observed his guest a good deal during the repast and formed numerous conclusions about him
He ate with palpable relish of every dish and he emptied his glass as promptly as his host could fill it
There was hardly a word of explanation as to the purpose of their meeting until the coffee was brought and they pushed back their chairs crossed their legs and lighted cigars
I was lucky to catch you with my wire at such short notice Thorpe said then
I sent two you knowto your chambers and your club
Which of them found you
Chambers said the General
I rarely dress till luncheon time
I read in bed
Theres really nothing else to do
Idleness is the curse of my life
Ive been wondering if youd like a little occupation of a wellpaid sort said Thorpe slowly
He realized that it was high time to invent some pretext for his hurried summons of the General
My dear sir responded the other I should like anything that had money in it
And I should very much like occupation tooif it were of course something that waswas suitable to me
Yes said Thorpe meditatively
Ive something in my mindnot at all definite yetin fact I dont think I can even outline it to you yet
But Im sure it will suit youthat is if I decide to go on with itand there ought to be seven or eight hundred a year for you in itfor life mind you
The Generals gaze fastened strenuously upon Thorpe shook a little
That will suit me very well he declared with feeling
Whatever I can do for ithe let the sentence end itself with a significant gesture
I thought so commented the other trifling with the spoon in his cup
But I want you to be open with me
Im interested in you and I want to be of use to you
All that Ive said I can do for you
But first Im curious to know everything that you can tell me about your circumstances
Im right in assuming I suppose that yourethat youre not any too wellfixed
The General helped himself to another little glass of brandy
His mood seemed to absorb the spirit of the liqueur
Fixed
he repeated with a peevish snap in his tone
Im not fixed at all as you call it
Good God sir
They no more care what becomes of me than they do about their old gloves
I gave them name and breeding and positionand everythingand they round on me likelike cuckoos
His pale bulging eyes lifted their passionless veil for an instant as he spoke and flashed with the predatory fierceness of a hawk
Intuition helped Thorpe to guess whom they might mean
The temper visibly rising in the old mans mind was what he had hoped for
He proceeded with an informed caution
Dont be annoyed if I touch upon family matters he said
Its a part of what I must know in order to help you
I believe youre a widower arent you General
The other after a quick upward glance shook his head resentfully
Mrs Kervick lives in Italy with HER soninlawand her daughter
He is a man of property and also apparently a man of remarkable credulity and patience
He paused to scan his companions face
They divide him between them he said then from clenched teethand Imind youI made the match
He was a young fellow that I foundand I brought him home and introduced himand I havent so much as an Italian postagestamp to show for it
But what interest can you possibly take in all this
The unamiable glance of his eyes was on the instant surcharged with suspicion
How many daughters have you
Thorpe ventured the enquiry with inward doubts as to its sagacity
Three answered the General briefly
It was evident that he was also busy thinking
I ask because I met one of them in the country over Sunday Thorpe decided to explain
The old soldiers eyes asked many questions in the moment of silence
Which oneEdiththat is Lady Cressage
he enquired
Of courseit would have been her
Thorpe nodded
She made a tremendous impression upon me he observed watching the father with intentness as he let the slow words fall
Well she might the other replied simply
Shes supposed to be the most beautiful woman in England
WellI guess she is Thorpe assented while the two men eyed each other
Is the third sister unmarried
it occurred to him to ask
The tone of the question revealed its perfunctory character
OhBeatriceshes of no importance the father replied
She goes in for writing and all thatshes not a beauty you knowshe lives with an old lady in Scotland
The oldest daughterBlancheshe has some good looks of her own but shes a cat
And so you met Edith
May I ask where it was
At Hadlow HouseLord Plowdens place you know
The Generals surprise at the announcement was undoubted
At Plowdens
he repeated and added as if half to himself I thought that was all over with long ago
I wish youd tell me about it said Thorpe daringly
Ive made it plain to you havent I
Im going to look out for you
And I want you to post me up here on some of the things that I dont understand
You remember that it was Plowden who introduced you to me dont you
It was through him that you got on the Board
Well certain things that Ive seen lead me to suppose that he did that in order to please your daughter
Did you understand it that way
Its quite likely in one sense returned the General
He spoke with much deliberation now weighing all his words
He may have thought it would please her he may not have known how little my poor affairs concerned her
Well then pursued Thorpe argumentatively he had an object in pleasing her
Let me ask the question did he want to marry her
Most men want to marry her was the fathers non committal response
His moustache lifted itself in the semblance of a smile but the blue eyes above remained coldly vigilant
WellI guess thats so too Thorpe remarked
He made a fleeting mental note that there was something about the General which impelled him to think and talk more like an American than ever
But was HE specially affected that way
I think said Kervick judicially I think it was understood that if he had been free to marry a penniless wife he would have wished to marry her
Do you know Thorpe began again with a kind of diffident hesitationdo you happen to have formed an ideasupposing that had been the casewould she have accepted him
Ah there you have me replied the other
Who can tell what women will accept and what they will refuse
My daughter refused Lord Lingfieldand he is an UnderSecretary and will be Earl Chobham and a Cabinet Minister and a rich man
After that what are you to say
You speak of her as penniless Thorpe remarked with a casual air
Six hundred a year the father answered
We could have rubbed along after a fashion on it if she had had any notions at all of taking my advice
Im a man of the world and I could have managed her affairs for her to her advantage but she insisted upon going off by herself
She showed not the slightest consideration for mebut then I am accustomed to that
Thorpe smiled reflectively and the old gentleman read in this an encouragement to expand his grievances
In my position he continued helping himself to still another tiny glass I naturally say very little
It is not my form to make complaints and advertise my misfortunes
I daresay its a fault
I know it kept me back in Indiawhile ever so many whippersnappers were promoted over my headbecause I was of the proud and silent sort
It was a mistake but it was my nature
I might have put by a comfortable provision for my old age in those days if I had been willing to push my claims and worry the Staff into giving me what was my due
But that I declined to doand when I was retired there was nothing for me but the ration of bread and salt which they serve out to the old soldier who has been too modest
I served my Queen sir for forty yearsand I should be ashamed to tell you the allowance she makes me in my old age
But I do not complain
My mouth is closed
I am an English gentleman and one of Her Majestys soldiers
Thats enough said eh
Do you follow me
And about my family affairs Im not likely to talk to the first comer eh
But to you I say it franklytheyve behaved badly damned badly sir
Mrs Kervick lives in Italy at the cost of HER soninlaw
He has large estates in one of the healthiest and most beautiful parts he has a palace and more money than he knows what to do withbut it seems that hes not my soninlaw
I could do with Italy very wellbut that doesnt enter into anyones calculations
No
let the wornout old soldier sell bootlaces on the kerb
Thats the spirit of womankind
And my daughter Edithdoes she care what becomes of me
Listen to meI secured for her the very greatest marriage in England
She would have been Duchess of Glastonbury today if her husband had not played the fool and drowned himself
Whats that you say
put in Thorpe swiftly
It was as good as suicide insisted the General with doggedness
His face had become a deeper red
They didnt hit it off together and he left in a huff and went yachting with his father who was his own sailing masterand as might be expected they were both drowned
The title would have gone to her sonbut no of course she had no sonand so it passed to a strangeran outsider that had been an usher in a school or something of that sort
You can fancy what a blow this was to me
Instead of being the grandfather of a Duke I have a childless widow thrust back upon my hands
Fine luck eh
And then to cap all she takes her six hundred a year and goes off by herself and gives me the cold shoulder completely
What is it Shakespeare says
How sharper than a serpents teeth Thorpe brought his fist down upon the table with an emphasis which abruptly broke the quotation in half
He had been frowning moodily at his guest for some minutes relighting his cigar more than once meanwhile
He had made a mental calculation of what the old man had had to drink and had reassured himself as to his condition
His garrulity might have an alcoholic basis but his wits were clear enough
It was time to take a new line with him
I dont want to hear you abuse your daughter he admonished him now with a purpose glowing steadily in his firm glance
Damn it all why shouldnt she go off by herself and take care of her own money her own way
Its little enough God knows for such a lady as she is
Why should you expect her to support you out of it
Nosit still
Listen to me
he stretched out his hand and laid it with restraining heaviness upon the Generals armyou dont want to have any row with me
You cant afford it
Just think that over to yourselfyoucantaffordit
MajorGeneral Kervicks prominent blue eyes had bulged forth in rage till their appearance had disconcerted the others gaze
They remained still too much in the foreground as it were and the angry scarlets and violets of the cheeks beneath them carried an unabated threat of apoplexybut their owner after a moments silence made a sign with his stiff white brows that the crisis was over
You must remember thatthat I have a fathers feelings he gasped then huskily
Thorpe nodded with a nonchalance which was not wholly affected
He had learned what he wanted to know about this veteran
If he had the fierce meannesses of a famished old dog he had also a dogs awe of a stick
It was almost too easy to terrorize him
Oh I make allowances for all that Thorpe began vaguely
But its important that you should understand me
Im this sort of a man whatever I set out to do and put my strength into it that I do
I kill every pheasant I fire at Plowden will tell you that
Its a way I have
To those that help me and are loyal to me Im the best friend in the world
To those that get in my way or try to trip me up Im the deviljust plain devil
Now thenyoure getting three hundred a year from my Company that is to say from me simply to oblige my friend Plowden
You dont do anything to earn this money youre of no earthly use on the Board
If I chose I could put you off at the end of the year as easily as I can blow out this match
But I propose not only to keep you on but to make you independent
Why do I do that
You should ask yourself that question
It cant be on account of anything you can do for the Company
What else then
Why first and foremost because you are the father of your daughter
Let me tell you the kind of man I am said the General inflating his chest and speaking with solemnity
Oh I know the kind of man you are Thorpe interrupted him coolly
I want to talk now
It was merely Kervick ventured in an injured tone that I can be as loyal as any man alive to a true friend
Well Ill be the true friend then said Thorpe with impatient finality
And now this is what I want to say
Im going to be a very rich man
Youre not to say so to anybody mind you until the thing speaks for itself
Were keeping dark for a few months dye seelying low
Then as I say I shall be a very rich man
Well now I wouldnt give a damn to be rich unless I did with my money the things that I wanted to do and got the things with it that I wanted to get
Whatever takes my fancy thats what Ill do
He paused for a moment mentally to scrutinize a brand new project which seemed by some surreptitious agency to have already taken his fancy
It was a curious project there were attractive things about it and objections to it suggested themselves as well
I may decide he began speaking again still revolving this hypothetical scheme in his thoughtsI may want towell heres what occurs to me as an offchance
I take an interest in your daughter dye see
and it seems a lowdown sort of thing to me that she should be so poor
Well thenI might say to you heres two thousand a year say made over to you in your name on the understanding that you turn over half of it say to her
She could take it from you of course as her father
You could say you made it out of the Company
Of course it might happen later on that I might like to have a gentle hint dropped to her dye see as to where it really came from
Mind I dont say this is what is going to be done
It merely occurred to me
After waiting for a moment for some comment he added a second thought Youd have to set about making friends with her you know
In any case youd better begin at that at once
The General remained buried in reflection
He lighted a cigarette and poured out for himself still another petit verre
His pursed lips and knitted brows were eloquent of intense mental activity
Well do you see any objections to it
demanded Thorpe at last
I do not quite see the reasons for it answered the other slowly
What would you gain by it
How do you meangain
put in the other with peremptory intolerance of tone
General Kervick spread his hands in a quick little gesture
These hands were withered but remarkably wellkept
I suppose one doesnt do something for nothing he said
I see what I would gain and what she would gain but I confess I dont see what advantage you would get out of it
Noo I daresay you dont assented Thorpe with sneering serenity
But what does that matter
You admit that you see what you would gain
Thats enough isnt it
The older mans veined temples twitched for an instant
He straightened himself in his chair and looked hard at his companion
There was a glistening of moisture about his staring eyes
It surely isnt necessaryamong gentlemenhe began cautiously picking his phrasesto have quite so much thats unpleasant is it
Noyoure rightI didnt mean to be so rough Thorpe declared with spontaneous contrition
Upon the instant however he perceived the danger that advantage might be taken of his softness
Im a plainspoken man he went on with a hardening voice and people must take me as they find me
All I said was in substance that I intended to be of service to youand that that ought to interest you
The General seemed to have digested his pique
And what I was trying to say he commented deferentially was that I thought I saw ways of being of service to you
But that did not seem to interest you at all
Howservice
Thorpe upon consideration consented to ask
I know my daughter so much better than you do explained the other I know Plowden so much better I am so much more familiar with the whole situation than you can possibly beI wonder that you wont listen to my opinion
I dont suggest that you should be guided by it but I think you should hear it
I think so too Thorpe declared readily enough
What IS your opinion
General Kervick sipped daintily at his glass and then gave an embarrassed little laugh
But I cant form what you might call an opinion he protested apologetically till I understand a bit more clearly what it is you propose to yourself
You mustnt be annoyed if I return to thatstill harping on my daughter you know
If I MUST ask the questionis it your wish to marry her
Thorpe looked blankly at his companion as if he were thinking of something else
When he spoke it was with no trace of consciousness that the question had been unduly intimate
I cant in the least be sure that I shall ever marry he replied thoughtfully
I may and I may not
Butstarting with that provisoI suppose I havent seen any other woman that Id rather think about marrying thanthan the lady were speaking of
However you see its all in the air so far as my plans go
In the air be it the soldier acquiesced plausibly
Let us consider it as if it were in the aira possible contingency
This is what I would sayMy the lady we are speaking of is by way of being a difficult ladyuncertain coy and hard to please as Scott says you knowand it must be a very skilfully dressed fly indeed which brings her to the surface
Shes been hooked once mind and she has a horror of it
Her husband was the most frightful brute and ruffian you know
I was strongly opposed to the marriage but her mother carried it through
Butyesabout herI think she is afraid to marry again
If she does ever consent it will be because poverty has broken her nerve
If she is kept on six hundred a year she may be starved so to speak into taking a husband
If she had sixteen hundredeither she would never marry at all or she would be free to marry some handsome young pauper who caught her fancy
That would be particularly like her
You would be simply endowing some needy fellow beside losing her for yourself
Dye follow me
If youll leave it to me I can find a much better way than thatbetter for all of us
Hm
said Thorpe and pondered the paternal statement
I see what you mean he remarked at last
YesI see
The General preserved silence for what seemed a long time deferring to the reverie of his host
When finally he offered a diversion in the form of a remark about the hour Thorpe shook himself and then ponderously rose to his feet
He took his hat and coat from the waiter and made his way out without a word
At the street door confronting the waning foliage of the Embankment garden Kervick was emboldened to recall to him the fact of his presence
Which way are you going
he asked
I dont know Thorpe answered absently
I thinkI think Ill take a walk on the Embankmentby myself
The General could not repress all symptoms of uneasiness
But when am I to see you again
he enquired with an effect of solicitude that defied control
See me
Thorpe spoke as if the suggestion took him by surprise
There are things to be settled are there not
the other faltered in distressed doubt as to the judicious tone to take
You spoke you know ofof some employment thatthat would suit me
Thorpe shook himself again and seemed by an effort to recall his wandering attention
Oh yes he said with lethargic vaguenessI havent thought it out yet
Ill let you knowwithin the week probably
With the briefest of nods he turned and crossed the road
Walking heavily with rounded shoulders and hands plunged deep in his overcoat pockets he went through the gateway and chose a path at random
To the idlers on the garden benches who took note of him as he passed he gave the impression of one struggling with nausea
To his own blurred consciousness he could not say which stirred most vehemently within him his loathing for the creature he had fed and bought or his bitter selfdisgust
The General standing with exaggerated exactness upon the doorstep had followed with his bulging eyes the receding figure
He stood still regarding the gateway mentally summarizing the events of the day after the other had vanished
At last nestling his chin comfortably into the fur of his collar he smiled with selfsatisfaction
After all he said to himself there are always ways of making a cad feel that he is a cad in the presence of a gentleman
CHAPTER X ON a Sunday afternoon early in February Thorpe journeyed with his niece and nephew from Bern to Montreux
The young people with maps and a guidebook open sat close together at the left side of the compartment
The girl from time to time rubbed the steam from the window with a napkin out of the lunchbasket
They both stared a good deal through this window with frequent exclamations of petulance
Isnt it too provoking
cried the girl turning to her uncle at last
This is where we are nowaccording to Baedeker As the train proceeds we enjoy a view of the SimmenThal and Freiburg mountains to the left the Moleson being conspicuous
And look at it
For all one can see we might as well be at Redhill
It is pretty hard luck Thorpe assented passively glancing past her at the pale neutraltinted wall of mist which obscured the view
But hang it allit must clear up some time
Just you have patience and youll see some Alps yet
Where were going the young man interposed the headporter told me it was always cloudier than anywhere else
I dont think that can be so Thorpe reasoned languidly from his corner
Its a great winter resort Im told and it rather stands to reason doesnt it
that people wouldnt flock there if it was so bad as all that
The kind of people weve seen travelling in Switzerland said the girlthey would do anything
Thorpe smiled with tolerant good humour
Well you can comfort yourself with the notion that youll be coming again
The mountainsll stay here all right he assured her
The young people smiled back at him and with this he rearranged his feet in a new posture on the opposite seat lighted another cigar and pillowed his head once more against the hard redplush cushion
Personally he did not in the least resent the failure of the scenery
For something more than three months this purposeless pleasuretour had been dragging him about from point to point sleeping in strange beds eating extraordinarily strange food transacting the affairs of a sightseer among people who spoke strange languages until he was surfeited with the unusual
It had all been extremely interesting of course and deeply improvingbut he was getting tired of talking to nobody but waiters and still more so of having nothing to do which he could not as well leave undone if he chose
After a few days more of Switzerlandfor they had already gazed with blank faces at this universal curtain of mist from such different points of view as Lucerne Interlaken and Thunit was clear to him that they would as he phrased it to himself make a break for home
Unless indeed something happened at Montreux
Ah would anything happen at Montreux
For four days his mind had been automatically reverting to that question it lurked continually in the background of his thoughts now as he smoked and idly ruminated on his way southward through the fog
All the rest of the prolonged trip had been without any specific motive so far as he was concerned
The youngsters had planned all its routes and halts and details of time and connections and he had gone along with cheerful placidity to look at the things they bade him observe and to pay the bills
Perhaps in all things their tastes had not been his tastes
He would have liked more of Paris he fancied and less of the small Dutch and North German towns which they seemed to fancy so much
Still the beer was goodand really their happiness as a spectacle had given him more satisfaction than a thousand miles of boulevards could have done
He liked this niece and nephew of his more than he could ever have imagined himself liking any young people
They had been shy with him at the outsetand for the first week his experiment had been darkened by the belief that between themselves they did not deem him quite good enough
He had been wise enough then to have it out with the girlshe was the one to whom he felt it easiest to talk franklyand had discovered to his immense relief that they conceived him to be regarding them as encumbrances
At breakfast next morning with tactful geniality he set everything right and thereafter they were all extremely happy together
So far as he could judge they were very superior young people both intellectually and spiritually
The girl spoke French and her brother German with what seemed to him remarkable proficiency
Their young minds were the repositories of an astounding amount of information they knew who Charles the Bold was they pointed out to their uncle the distinction between Gothic and Romanesque arches they explained what was the matter with the Anabaptists they told him that the story of the Bishop and the rats at Bingen was a baseless myth and that probably there had never been any such man as William Tell
Nor did they get all this out of the guidebooks which they pored over with such zest
It was impossible not to see that they were familiar with large numbers of the subjects that these books discussed and that the itinerary which they marked out had reference to desires and interests that they had cultivated for themselves
Julia upon even first sight made a much pleasanter impression than her mothers hesitating description had prepared him for
As he came to know her well he ceased to remember that there was a question in any mind as to her being a pretty girl
There was less colour in her face than he could have wished
Her smooth pallid skin almost waxen in texture had a suggestion of delicate health which sometimes troubled him a little but which appealed to the tenderness in his nature all the time
The face was unduly thin perhaps but this and the wistful glance of the large grey eyes in repose made up an effect that Thorpe found touched him a good deal
Even when she was in visibly high spirits the look in these eyes seemed to him to be laying claim to his protection
She could be merry upon occasion in a gentle and tranquil way and as her selfconfidence expanded under the shelter of their growing intimacy she disclosed to her uncle plenty of initiative and individualitybut what he felt in her most was a peculiarly sweet and girlish trustfulness which made him like himself more than he had ever done before
He could feel that he was at his very besta hitherto unsuspected bestwhen Julia was about
He wanted to buy for her everything in the windows upon which she bestowed the most casual approving glance
It was a delight merely to look at her and to meditate upon the felicity of being able to do things for so charming a girl
Alfred made a less direct demand upon his uncles admiration but he was a very good fellow all round
He was big and fair and muscular and nothing about him but his spectacles seemed in Thorpes mind to be related to his choice of art as a profession
That so robust and hearty a young fellow should wish to put paint on a canvas with small brushes was to the uncle an unaccountable thing
It was almost as if he had wanted to knit or do embroidery
Of the idleness and impatience of discipline which his mother had seemed to allege against him Thorpe failed to detect any signs
The young man was never very late in the morning and beside his tireless devotion to the task of hunting up old pictures in outoftheway places did most of the stewards work of the party with intelligence and precision
He studied the timetables audited the hotelbills looked after the luggage got up the streetmaps of towns and the like to such good purpose that they never lost a train or a bag or themselves
Truly an excellent young man
Thorpe noted with especial satisfaction his fine kindly bigbrother attitude toward his sister Juliaand it was impossible for him to avoid the conviction that Louisa was a simpleton not to appreciate such children
They did not often allude to their mother when they did it was in language the terms of which seemed more affectionate than the toneand Thorpe said often to himself that he did not blame them
It was not so much that they had outgrown their mothers point of view
They had never occupied it
The journey so far as Thorpe comprehended its character had been shaped with about equal regard for Julias interest in the romance of history and Alfreds more technical and practical interest in art
Each had sufficient sympathy with the tastes of the other however to prevent any tendency to separation
They took their uncle one day to see where William the Silent was assassinated and the next to observe how Rembrandts theory of guild portraitpainting differed from Van der Helsts with a common enthusiasm
He scrutinized with patient loyalty everything that they indicated to him and not infrequently they appeared to like very much the comments he offered
These were chiefly of a sprightly nature and when Julia laughed over them he felt that she was very near to him indeed
Thus they saw Paris togetherwhere Thorpe did relinquish some of the multiplied glories of the Louvre to sit in front of a cafe by the Opera House and see the funny people go pastand thence by Bruges and Antwerp to Holland where nobody could have imagined there were as many pictures as Thorpe saw with his own weary eyes
There were wonderful old buildings at Lubeck for Julias eyes to glisten over and pictures at Berlin Dresden and Dusseldorf for Alfred
The assumption existed that the excursion into the Thuringenwald to see the memorials of Luther was especially for the uncles benefit and he tried solicitously to say or look nothing which might invalidate it
There were other places in Germany from Mainz to Munich which he remembered best by their different beers
They spent Christmas at Vienna where Julia had heard that its observance was peculiarly insisted upon and then they saw the Tyrol in its heaviest vesture of winter snows and beautiful old Basle where Alfred was crazier about Holbein than he had been at Munich over Brouwer
Thorpe looked very carefully at the paintings of both men and felt strengthened in his hopes that when Alfred got a little older he would see that this picture business was not the thing for a young gentleman with prospects to go into
It was at Basle that Thorpe received a letter from London which directly altered the plans of the party
He had had several other letters from London which had produced no such effect
Through Semple he had followed in outline the unobtrusive campaign to secure a Special Settlement and had learned that the Stock Exchange Committee apparently without opposition had granted one for the first week in February
Even this news tremendously important as it was did not prompt Thorpe to interfere with the childrens projects
There was no longer any point in remaining away from London there were indeed numerous reasons for a prompt return
But he was loth to deprive the youngsters of that descent into smiling sunlit Italy upon which they had so fondly dwelt in fancy and after all Semple could do all that was needful to be done for another month
So they went to Basle and here it was that another kind of letter came
It was in a strange hand at once cramped and fluttering which puzzled the recipient a good deal it was a long time before even the signature unravelled itself
Then he forced himself to decipher it sentence by sentence with a fierce avidity
It was from General Kervick
The next morning Thorpe astonished his young companions by suggesting an alteration in their route
In a roundabout and tentative fashionin which more suspicious observers must have detected something shamefacedhe mentioned that he had always heard a great deal about Montreux as a winterresort
The fact that he called it Montroox raised in Julias mind a fleeting wonder from whom it could be that he had heard so much about it but it occurred to neither her nor her brother to question his entire good faith
Their uncle had displayed hitherto a most comforting freedom from discrimination among European towns he had indeed assured them many times that they were all one to him
That he should suddenly turn up now with a favourite winterresort of his own selection surprised them considerably but upon reflection it also pleased them
He had humoured all their wishes with such unfailing and bountiful kindness that it was a delight to learn that there was something he wanted to do
They could not finish their breakfast till the guidebook had been brought to the table
Oh
How splendid
Julia had cried then
The Castle of Chillon is there
Why of course
said Thorpe complacently
They laughed gayly at him for pretending that he had known this and he as goodhumouredly accepted their banter
He drew a serious long breath of relief however when their backs were turned
It had gone off much better than he had feared
Now on this Sunday afternoon as the train made its surefooted way across the mountains the thought that he was actually to alight at Montreux at once fascinated and depressed him
He was annoyed with himself for suffering it to get such a hold upon his mind
What was there in it anyway
There was a big hotel there and he and his youngsters were to stop at it and if he accidentally encountered a certain lady who was also stopping thereand of course the meeting would bear upon its face the stamp of pure chancewhat of it
And if he did meet her thus fortuitouslywhat would happen then
No doubt a lady of her social position met abroad great numbers of people that she had met at home
It would not in any way surprise herthis chance encounter of which he thought so much
Were there sufficient grounds for imagining that it would even interest her
He forced his mind up to this question as it were many times and invariably it shied and evaded the leap
There had been times at Hadlow House when Lady Cressage had seemed supremely indifferent to the fact of his existence and there had been other times when it had appeared manifest that he pleased heror better perhaps that she was willing to take note of how much she pleased him
It must have been apparent to herthis fact that she produced such an impression upon him
He reasoned this out satisfactorily to himself
These beautiful women trained from childhood for the conquest of a rich husband must have cultivated an extraordinary delicacy of consciousness in such matters
They must have developed for themselves what might be called a sixth sensea power of feeling in the air what the men about were thinking of them
More than once he had caught a glimmer of what he felt to be the operation of this sense in the company of Lady Cressage
He could not say that it had been discernible in her glance or her voice or her manner precisely but he was sure that he had seen it somehow
But even assuming all thisadmitting that in October on a wet Sunday in the tedium of a small countryhouse party she had shown some momentary satisfaction in the idea that he was profoundly impressed by herdid it at all follow that in February amid the distractions of a fashionable winterresort and probably surrounded by hosts of friends she would pay any attention to him whatever
The abject fear that she might not even remember himmight not know him from Adam when he stood before herskulked about in the labyrinths of his mind but he drove it back whenever it showed itself
That would be too ignominious
The young people at the other side of the compartment forever wiping the window with the napkin and straining their eyes to see the invisible diverted his unsettled attention
A new perception of how much he liked them and enjoyed having them with him took hold of his thoughts
It had not occurred to him before with any definiteness that he would be insupportably lonely when the time came to part with them
Now when he dwelt upon it it made him feel sad and old
He said to himself at once with decision that there need be no parting at all
He would take a house without delay and they should live with him
He could not doubt that this would be agreeable to them it would solve every problem for him
His fancy sketched out the natural and legitimate extensions of this project
There would be first of all a house in towna furnished house of a modest sort having no pretension save to provide a cheerful temporary shelter for three people who liked one another
Here the new household would take shape and get its right note of character
Apparently Louisa would not be urged to form part of this household
He said to himself with frankness that he didnt want her and there had been nothing to indicate that her children would pine for her
She showed good sense when she said that her place was in the shop and in her ancestral home over the shop
No doubt there would be a certain awkwardness visible to others if not to themselves about her living in one part of London and her children in another
But here also her good sense would come onand besides this furnished house in town would be a mere brief overture to the real thingthe noble country mansion he was going to have with gardens and horses and hounds and artificial lakes and deer parks and everything
Quite within the year he would be able to realize this consummation of his dreams
How these nice young people would revel in such a placeand how they would worship him for having given it to them for a home
His heart warmed within him as he thought of this
He smiled affectionately at the picture Julia made polishing the glass with vehement circular movements of her slight arm and then grimacing in comic vexation at the deadly absence of landscape outside
Was there ever a sweeter or more lovable girl in this world
Would there have to be some older woman to manage the house at the beginning
he wondered
He should like it immensely if that could be avoided
Julia looked fragile and inexperiencedbut she would be twentyone next month
Surely that was a mature enough age for the slight responsibility of presiding over servants who should be the best that money could buy
Many girls were married and given households of their own to manage when they were even younger
This reflection raised an obstacle against the smooth flowing current of his thoughts
Supposing that Julia got the notion of marryinghow miserable that would make everything
Very likely she would never do any such thing he had observed in her no shadow of a sign that a thought of matrimony had ever crossed her brain
Yet that was a subject upon which of course she could not be asked to give pledges even to herself
Thorpe tried to take a liberal view of this matter
He argued to himself that there would be no objection at all to incorporating Julias husband into the household assuming that she went to the length of taking one and that he was a good fellow
On this latter point it was only the barest justice to Julias tastes and judgment to take it for granted that he would be a good fellow
Yet the uncle felt uneasily that this would alter things for the worse
The family party with that hypothetical young man in it could never be quite so innocently and completely happy asfor instancethe family party in this compartment had been during these wonderful three months
Mechanically he rubbed the window beside him and turned to look out with a certain fixednessas if he might chance to catch a glimpse of the bridegroom with whom Julia would have it in her power to disturb the serenity of their prospective home
A steep white cliff receding sullenly against the dim grey skyline a farmhouse grotesquely low for its size crouching under big shelving galleries heaped with snow an opening in front to the right where vaguely there seemed to be a valley into which they would descendhe saw these things
They remained in his mind afterward as a part of something else that he saw with his mental vision at the same momenta strikingly real and vivid presentment of Lady Cressage attired as he had seen her in the saddle her light hair blown about a little under her hat a spot of colour in the exquisite cheek the cold impersonal dignity of a queen in the beautiful profile
The picture was so actual for the instant that he uttered an involuntary exclamationand then looked hastily round to see whether his companions had heard it
Seemingly they had not he lolled again upon the comfortless cushion and strove to conjure up once more the apparition
Nothing satisfactory came of the effort
Upon consideration he grew uncertain as to whether he had seen anything at all
At the most it was a kind of halfdream which had visited him
He yawned at the thought and lighted a fresh cigar
All at once his mind had become too indolent to do any more thinking
A shapeless impression that there would be a good many things to think over later on flitted into his brain and out again
Well how are the mountains using you now
he called out to his niece
Oh I could shake them
she declared
Listen to this A view of singular beauty embracing the greater part of the Lake of Geneva and the surrounding mountains is suddenly disclosed
Thats where we are nowor were a minute ago
You can see that there is some sort of valley in front of usbut that is all
If I could only see one mountain with snow on it Why its all mountains and all snow when you come to that Thorpe insisted with jocose perversity
Youre on mountains yourself all the time
You know what I mean she retorted
I want to see something like the coloured pictures in the hotels
Oh probably it will be bright sunlight tomorrow he said for perhaps the twentieth time that day
Therethat looks like water
said Alfred
See
just beyond the village
Yes it is water
Theres your Lake of Geneva at all events
But it isnt the right colour protested Julia peering through the glass
Its precisely like everything else its of no colour at all
And they always paint it such a lovely blue
Really uncle the Swiss Government ought to return you your money
You wait till you see it tomorrowor next day said the uncle vaguely
He closed his eyes and welcomed a drowsy mood
As he went off to sleep the jolting racket of the train mellowed itself into a murmur of tomorrow or next day tomorrow or next day in his ears
CHAPTER XI FROM their windows high up and at the front of the big hotel Julia looked down upon the Lake of Geneva
She was in such haste to behold it that she had not so much as unbuttoned her gloves she held her muff still in her hand
After one brief glance she groaned aloud with vexation
Beyond the roadway and the deserted miniature pier of Territet both dishevelled under melting and mudstained snow there lay a patch of watermotionless inconspicuous of a faded drab colourwhich at some small distance out vaguely ceased to look like water and yet a little further out became part and parcel of the dull grey mist
Save for the forlorn masts of a couple of fishing boats beached under the shelter of the pier there was no proof in sight that this was a lake at all
It was as uninspiring to the eye as a pool of drippings from umbrellas in a porch
While her uncle and brother occupied themselves with the luggage being brought up by the porters she opened a window and stepped out upon the tiny balcony
A flaring sign on the inner framework of this balcony besought her in SwissFrench in the interests of order not to feed the birds
The injunction seemed meaningless to her until she perceived over by the water several gulls lazily wheeling about
They were almost as grey as the fog they circled in
Suddenly they seemed to perceive her in turn and swerving sharply came floating toward the hotel with harsh almost menacing cries
She hurried in and shut the window with decision
It seemed to her that the smile with which as she turned she was able to meet her uncles look was a product of true heroism
Apparently this smile did not altogether delude him
Oh now you mustnt get down on your luck he adjured her
Were going to be awfully cozy here
Have you seen your room
Its just there in a little alley to the right of the door
They say it has an even finer view than these windows
Oh you neednt laughthis is the best view in the world Im told by those who know
And as a winterresort why I say look here
The interruption came from Alfred who having gone out on one of the balconies put in his head now to summon them
Come here
Heres some fun
He pointed out to Thorpe the meaning of the inscription on the sign and then pulled him forward to observe its practical defiance
A score of big gulls were flapping and dodging in excited confusion close before them filling their ears with a painful clamour
Every now and again one of the birds recovering its senses in the hurlyburly would make a curving swoop downward past the rows of windows below and triumphantly catch in its beak something that had been thrown into the air
Thorpe leaning over his railing saw that a lady on a balcony one floor below and some yards to the left was feeding the birds
She laughed aloud as she did so and said something over her shoulder to a companion who was not visible
Well thats pretty cool he remarked to his niece who had come to stand beside him
Shes got the same sign down there that weve got
I can see it from here
Or perhaps she cant read French
Or perhaps she isnt frightened of the hotel people suggested the girl
She added after a little I think Ill feed them myself in the morning
I certainly shall if the sun comes outas a sort of Thanksgiving festival you know
Her uncle seemed not to hear her
He had been struck by the exceptional grace of the gestures with which the pieces of bread were flung forth
The hands and wrists of this lady were very white and shapely
The movements which she made with them all unaware of observation as she was and viewed as he viewed them from above were singularly beautiful in their unconstraint
It was in its way like watching some remarkable fine dancing he thought
He could not see much of her face from his perch but she was tall and fashionably clad
There was a loose covering of black lace thrown over her head but once as she turned he could see that her hair was red
Even in this fleeting glimpse the unusual tint attracted his attention there was a brilliancy as of fire in it
Somehow it seemed to make a claim upon his memory
He continued to stare down at the stranger with an indefinable sense that he knew something about her
Suddenly another figure appeared upon the balconyand in a flash he comprehended everything
These idiotic fighting gluttons of gulls had actually pointed out to him the object of his search
It was Lady Cressage who stood in the doorway there just below himand her companion the redhaired lady who laughed hotelrules to scorn was the American heiress who had crossed the ocean in his ship and whom he had met later on at Hadlow
What was her nameMartin
NoMadden
He confronted the swift impression that there was something odd about these two women being together
At Hadlow he had imagined that they did not like each other
Then he reflected as swiftly that women probably had their own rules about such matters
He seemed to have heard or read perhaps that females liked and disliked each other with the most capricious alternations and on the least tangible of grounds
At all events here they were together now
That was quite enough
The two ladies had gone in and closed their window
The sophisticated birds with a few ungrateful croaks of remonstrance had drifted away again to the water
His niece had disappeared from his elbow
Still Thorpe remained with his arms folded on the railing his eyes fixed on the vacant balcony below to the left
When at last he went inside the young people were waiting for him with the project of a stroll before dinner
The light was failing but there was plenty of time
They had ascertained the direction in which Chillon lay a servant had assured them that it was only a few minutes walk and Alfred was almost certain that he had seen it from the window
Thorpe assented with a certain listlessness which they had never noted in his manner before but when Julia begged him not to stir if he were in the slightest degree tired he replied honestly enough that he would do anything rather than be left alone
Then of course they said there should be no walk but to this he would not listen
The party trooped downstairs accordingly and out into the street
The walking was vile but as Julia had long ago said if they were to be deterred by slush they would never get anywhere or see anything
It proved to be too late and too dark to either enter the castle or get much of an idea of its exterior
Returning they paused again to look into the lighted window of the nice little bookshop
The numerous photographs of what they were entitled to behold from the windows of their hotel seemed more convincing than photographs usually were
As the young people inspected them they became reassured
It was not credible that such a noble vista would forever deny itself to such earnest pilgrims
When their uncle introduced this time his ancient formula about the certainty of brilliant sunshine in the morning they somehow felt like believing him
YesI really think it must change Julia declared with her fascinated glance upon the photographs
Alfred looked at his watch
Wed better get along to the hotel hadnt we
he suggested
By the wayThorpe began with a certain uneasiness of mannerspeaking of dinner wouldnt you like to dine at the big table dhote instead of up in our sittingroom
If youre tired of our dining aloneby all means answered Julia readily
There was obvious surprise however in both her look and tone
Tired nothing
he assured her
I like it better than anything else in the world
But what I mean isI was thinking seeing that this is such a great winter resort and all the swagger people of Europe come here that probably you youngsters would enjoy seeing the crowd
Julias glance full of affectionate appreciation showed how wholly she divined his spirit of selfsacrifice
We wouldnt care in the least for it she declared
We enjoy being a little party by ourselves every whit as much as you doand we both hate the people you get at table dhotesand besides for that matter if there are any real swells here you may be sure they dine in their own rooms
Why of course
Thorpe exclaimed swiftly in palpable selfrebuke
I dont know what I could have been thinking of
Of course they would dine in their rooms
Next morning Thorpe rose earlier than everwith the impression of a peculiarly restless and uncomfortable night behind him
It was not until he had shaved and dressed that he noted the altered character of the air outside
Although it was not fully daylight yet he could see the outlines of the trees and vinerows on the big snowclad hill which monopolized the prospect from his window all sharp and clear cut as if he were looking at them through an operaglass
He went at once to the sittingroom and thrust the curtains aside from one of the windows
A miracle had been wrought in the night
The sky overhead was serenely cloudless the lake beneath stirring softly under some faint passing breeze revealed its full breadth with crystalline distinctness
Between sky and water there stretched across the picture a broad looming dimlydefined band of shadow marked here and there at the top by little slanting patches of an intensely glowing white
He looked at this darkling middle distance for a moment or two without comprehension
Then he turned and hurriedly moved to the door of Julias room and beat upon it
Get up
he called through the panels
Heres your sunriseheres your Alpine view
Go to your window and see it
A clear voice not unmirthful replied Ive been watching it for half an hour thanks
Isnt it glorious
He was more fortunate at the opposite door for Alfred was still asleep
The young man upon hearing the news however made a toilet of unexampled brevity and came breathlessly forth
Thorpe followed him to the balcony where he stood collarless and uncombed with the fresh morning breeze blowing his hair awry his lips parted his eyes staring with what the uncle felt to be a painful fixedness before him
Thorpe had seen many mountains in many lands
They did not interest him very much
He thought however that he could see now why people who had no mountains of their own should get excited about Switzerland
He understood a number of these sentimental things now for that matter which had been Greek to him three months before
Unreceptive as his philistinism may have seemed to these delightful youngsters it was apparent enough to him that they had taught him a great deal
If he could not hope to share their everbubbling raptures and enthusiasms at least he had come to comprehend them after a fashion and even to discern sometimes what it was that stirred them
He watched his nephew nowhaving first assured himself by a comprehensive downward glance that no other windows of the hotelfront were open
The young man seemed tremendously moved far too much so to talk
Thorpe ventured once some remarks about the Mexican mountains which were ever so much bigger as he remembered them but Alfred paid no heed
He continued to gaze across the lake watching in rapt silence one facet after another catch the light and stand out from the murky gloom radiantly white till at last the whole horizon was a mass of shining minarets and domes and the sun fell full on his face
Then with a longdrawn sigh he turned reentered the room and threw himself into a chair
Its too good
he declared with a halfgroan
I didnt know it would be like that
Why nothings too good for us man his uncle told him
THAT is said the boy simply and Thorpe after staring for a moment smiled and rang the bell for breakfast
When Julia made her appearance a few minutes later the table was already laid and the waiter was coming in with the coffee
I thought wed hurry up breakfast her uncle explained after she had kissed him and thanked him for the sunrise he had so successfully predictedbecause I knew youd both be crazy to get out
He had not overestimated their eagerness which was so great indeed that they failed to note the excessive tranquility of his own demeanour
He ate with such unusual deliberation on this exciting morning that they found themselves at the end of their repast when apparently he had but made a beginning
Now you mustnt wait for me at all he announced to them then
Im a little tired this morningand I think Id just like to lie around and smoke and perhaps read one of your novels
But you two must get your things on and lose no time in getting out
This is the very best time of day you knowfor Alpine scenery
Id hate to have you miss any of it
Under his kindly if somewhat strenuous insistence they went to their rooms to prepare for an immediate excursion
He was so anxious to have them see all there was to be seen that when Julia returned properly cloaked and befurred and stood waiting at the window he scolded a little
What on earth is that boy doing
he exclaimed with a latent snarl in his tone which was novel to her ear
Hell keep you here till noon
Hes shaving I think
He wont be long she replied with great gentleness
After a moments pause she turned from the window and came gayly forward
Oh I forgot I was going to feed the birds
There are several of them out there now
As she spoke she busily broke up some of the rolls on the table
Her face was bright with the pleasure of the thought
If you dont much mind Julia her uncle began with almost pleading intonations I rather think I wouldnt feed those birds
The rule is there before our eyes you knowand its always been my idea that if youre at a hotel its the correct thing to abide by its rules
Its just an idea of mineand I daresay if you think about it youll feel the same way
The girl freed the last remaining breadcrumb from her gloves
Why of course uncle she said with promptitude
Although there was no hint of protest in her tone or manner he felt impelled to soften still further this solitary demonstration of his authority
You see Ive been all round the world my little girl he explained haltingly and when a mans done that and knocked about everywhere hes apt to get finicking and notional about trifles every once in a while
Youre less so than anybody I ever knew she generously interposed
Oh no Im not
You dont know me well enough yet thats whats the matter
And you see Juliaanother thing just because you saw that lady throwing out bread that aint a very good reason why you should do it
You dont know what kind of a person she may be
Girls have got to be so frightfully careful about all that sort of thing
Julia offered a constrained little laugh in comment
Oh you dont know how careful I can be she said
But youre not annoyed
he entreated herand for answer she came behind him and rested an arm on his shoulder and patted it
He stroked her hand with his own
Thats something like the nicest niece in the world
he exclaimed with fervour
When at last she and her brother had gone he made short work of his breakfast and drank his coffee at a gulp
A restless activity suddenly informed his movements
He lit a cigar and began pacing up and down the room biting his lips in preoccupation as he went
After a little he opened a window and ventured cautiously as far out on the balcony as was necessary to obtain a view of the street below
Eventually he identified his nephew and niece among the pedestrians beneath him and he kept them in sight till after more than one tiresome halt at a shop window they disappeared round a bend in the road
Then he turned and came back into the room with the buoyant air of a man whose affairs are prospering
He smiled genially to himself as he gathered from the table in one capacious hand all the pieces of bread his beloved niece had broken up and advanced again to the open window
Waiting here till one of the dingy gulls moving aimlessly about was headed toward him he tossed out a fragment
The bird dashed at it with a scream and on the instant the whole squawking flock were on wing
He suffered the hubbub to proceed unappeased for a little while he kept a watchful though furtive eye on that balcony to the left below
Unhappily he could not get out far enough to see whether the inner curtains of its window were drawn
He threw another bit of bread and then looked at his watch
It was a few minutes past nine
Surely people travelling to see scenery would be up by this hour
The strategy of issuing just enough bread to keep the feathered concourse in motion commended itself to his mind
As a precautionary measure he took all the rolls remaining on the table and put them in the drawer of a desk by the window
It even occurred to him to ring for more bread but upon consideration that seemed too daring
The waiter would be sufficiently surprised at the partys appetites as it was
Half an hour later his plan of campaign suddenly yielded a victory
Lady Cressage appeared on her balcony clad in some charming sort of morning gown and bareheaded
She had nothing in her hands and seemed indifferent to the birds but when Thorpe flung forth a handful of fragments into the centre of their whirling flock she looked up at him
It was the anxious instant and he ventured upon what he hoped was a decorous compromise between a bow and a look of recognition
She was in no haste to answer either
He could see rather than hear that she said something to her invisible companion within the while she glanced serenely in the general direction of his balcony
It seemed to him that the answer to her remark whatever it was must have exerted a direct influence upon his destiny for Lady Cressage all at once focussed her vague regard upon him and nodded with a reasonably gracious smile
Its wonderful luck to find you here he called down to her
Having played their part he wished now that the birds were at Jericho
Their obstreperous racket made conversation very difficult
Apparently she made him an answer but he could catch nothing of it
Im here with my niece and nephew he shouted down
I dont hear what you say
May I come down and pay my respectslater on
What is your number and when may I come
These questions as he flashed them in review through his mind seemed to be all right from the most exacting social point of view
Doubtless it was equally all right that before replying she should consult her companion as she did at some length
Then she repliedand he had no difficulty now in hearing her above the birdsthat it would be very nice of him to come say in an hours time
She told him the numberand then almost abruptly went in
Thorpe during this hour that ensued smoked with volcanic energy
He tried to interest himself in one after another of half a dozen Tauchnitz novels his niece carried about with a preposterous absence of success
He strove to arrange in some kind of sequence the things that he should say when this momentous interview should begin but he could think of nothing which did not sound silly
It would be all right he argued to himself in the face of this present mental barrenness he always talked well enough on the spur of the moment when the time cameand still was not reassured
He wondered if both ladies would be there to receive him and decided that they would probably regard that as indispensable to the proprieties
In that case their conversation would necessarily be of the most casual and general character
He would tell them a good deal about his niece he foresaw
A man travelling about with a nieceand such a delightfully ladylike and engaging little niecewould take on some added interest and dignity he perceived in the eyes of ladies travelling alone
He essayed to estimate just how much they would probably like Julia
Of course he would say nothing about her mother and the bookshop a vague allusion to a widowed sister would be ample on that head
But there could be confident references to Cheltenham he knew from what Julia had said that it suggested the most satisfactory social guarantees if taken strictly by itself
And then so much would depend upon Julia herself
If she succeeded in striking up a friendship with themah then everything would be all right
Perhaps they would take a fancy to Alfred too
He was a boy of course but conceivably the fact that he wanted to paint and knew about pictures would appeal to them
He seemed to have heard somewhere that artists were the very devil among women
At last the weary time of waiting had worn itself out somehow and after a final polishing before his glass he went down and found his right corridor and knocked at the door
A pleasant voice bade him enter and hat and gloves in hand he went in
As he had imagined both ladies were present
He had not been prepared however for the fact that it was the American who played the part of hostess
It was she who received him and invited him to sit down and generally made him free of the apartment
When he shook hands with Lady Cressage there was somehow an effect of the incidental in the ceremony as if she were also a guest
Nothing could have been simpler or more pleasing than the little visit turned out to be
Miss Madden had suddenly grown tired of the snowless and dripping English winter and had as promptly decided to come to Switzerland where the drifts ought to be high enough and the frosts searching enough in all conscience
They had selected Territet because it was familiar to her and because it was on the way to Martigny and Brieg and she had had a notion of crossing either the Simplon or the St Bernard in winter
As she found now the St Bernard was quite impracticable but admittedly a post road was kept open over the Simplon
It was said now that she would not be allowed to proceed by this but it often happened that she did the things that she was not allowed to do
The hotelpeople at both Brieg and Berisal had written refusing to let their horses attempt the Simplon journey and they were of course quite within their rights but there were other horses in Switzerland
One surely could buy horsesand so on
Thorpe also had his turn at autobiography
He told rather whimsically of his three months experiences at the tail of the juvenile whirligigs and his auditors listened to them with mild smiles
He ventured upon numerous glowing parentheses about Julia and they at least did not say that they did not want to know her
They heard with politeness too what he could contrive to drag in about his artistnephew and said it must be very pleasant for him to have such nice company
At least Miss Madden said this her companion as he thought it over afterward seemed hardly to have said anything at all
She answered the few remarks which he found it possible to direct to her but the responses took no hold upon his memory
He fancied that she was bored or unhappy or both
Finally in the midst of commonplaces which to his apprehension were verging upon flatness a bold inspiration disclosed itselfas splendid as the Dent du Midi revealing its glaciers above the mounting sunrisein his brain
We should all be charmed if you would come up and dine with us tonight he said under the abrupt impulsion of this idea
Its been such an age since we wanderers have had the privilege of company at our table
The felicity of these phrases from his lips attracted his admiring attention even while he waited in suspense for an answer to them
The ladies exchanged a look
Yes said Miss Madden after the slightest of pauses we shall be very happy
Shortly thereafter Thorpe took his leave and went downstairs and out
He wandered about till luncheon time observing the mountains across the lake from various standpoints and as it were with new eyes
He was interested in them in a curious new fashion they seemed to say things to him
His lip curled once at the conceit that he was one of the Alps himself
CHAPTER XII IT did not happen until three days later that Thorpes opportunity to speak alone with Lady Cressage came
In this brief period the two parties seemed to have become fused in a remarkable intimacy
This was clearly due to the presence of the young people and Thorpe congratulated himself many times each day upon the striking prescience he had shown in bringing them
Both the ladies unaffectedly liked Julia so much so that they seemed unwilling to make any plans which did not include her
Then it was only a matter of course that where she went her brother should goand a further logical step quite naturally brought in their willing uncle
If he had planned everything and now was ordering everything it could not have gone more to his liking
Certain side speculations lent a savour to the satisfaction with which he viewed this state of affairs
He found many little signs to confirm the suspicion that the two ladies had been the readier to make much of Julia because they were not overkeen about each others society
The bright sweetnatured girl had come as a welcome diversion to a couple who in seclusion did battle with tendencies to yawn
He was not quite convinced for that matter that the American lady always went to that trouble
She seemed to his observation a wilful sort of person who would not be restrained by small ordinary considerations from doing the things she wanted to do
Her relations with her companion afforded him food for much thought
Without any overt demonstrations she produced the effect of ordering Lady Cressage about
This so far as it went tended to prejudice him against her
On the other hand however she was so good to Julia in a peculiarly frank and buoyant way which fascinated the girl that he could not but like her
And she was very good to Alfred too
There was indeed he perceived a great deal of individuality about the friendship which had sprung up between Miss Madden and his nephew
She was years his seniorhe settled it with himself that the American could not be less than sevenandtwentyyet Alfred stole covert glances of admiration at her and seemed to think of nothing but opportunities for being in her company as ifas ifThorpe hardly liked to complete the comparison in his own thoughts
Alfred of course said it was all on account of her wonderful hair he rather went out of his way to dilate upon the enthusiasm her colour schemewhatever that might meanexcited in him as an artist
The uncle had moments of profound skepticism about thismoments when he uneasily wondered whether it was not going to be his duty to speak to the young man
For the most part however he extracted reassurance from Miss Maddens demeanour toward the lad
She knew it seemed a vast deal about pictures at least she was able to talk a vast deal about them and she did it in such a calmly dogmatic fashion laying down the law always that she put Alfred in the position of listening as a pupil might listen to a master
The humility with which his nephew accepted this position annoyed Thorpe upon occasion but he reasoned that it was a fault on the right side
Very likely it would help to keep the fact of the ladys seniority more clearly before the youngsters mind and that would be so much gained
And these apprehensions after all were scarcely to be counted in the balance against the sense of achieved happiness with which these halcyon days kept Thorpe filled
The initiatory dinner had gone off perfectly
He could have wished indeed that Julia had a smarter frock and more rings when he saw the imposing costumes and jewelled throats and hands of his guestsbut she was a young girl by comparison he reflected and there could be no doubt that they found her charming
As for Alfred he was notably finelooking in his eveningclothesinfinitely more like the son of a nobleman the gratified uncle kept saying to himself than that big dullard the Honourable Balder
It filled him with a new pleasure to remember that Alfred had visiting cards presenting his name as DAubigny which everybody of education knew was what the degenerate Dabney really stood for
The lad and his sister had united upon this excellent change long ago at Cheltenham and oddly enough they had confessed it to their uncle at the beginning of the trip with a show of trepidation as if they feared his anger
With radiant gayety he had relieved their minds by showing them his card with Mr Stormont Thorpe alone upon it
At the dinner table in the proudest moment of his life he had made himself prouder still by thinking how distinguished an appearance his and Alfreds cards would make together in the apartment below next day
But next day the relations between the two parties had already become too informal for cards
Julia went down to see them they came up to see Julia
Then they all went for a long walk with luncheon at Vevey and before evening Alfred was talking confidently of painting Miss Madden
Next day they went by train to St Maurice and returning after dark dined without ceremony together
This third daythe weather still remaining brightthey had ascended by the funicular road to Glion and walked on among the swarming luegers up to Caux
Here after luncheon they had wandered about for a time regarding the panorama of lake and mountains
Now as the homeward descent began chance led the two young people and Miss Madden on ahead
Thorpe found himself walking beside Lady Cressage
He had upon his arm her outer wrap which she said she would put on presently
To look at the view he must glance past her face the profile under the graceful fur cap was so enriched by glowing colour that it was to his thought as if she were blushing
How little I thought a few months ago he said that we should be mountaineering together
Oh no one knows a day ahead she responded vaguely
I had probably less notion of coming to Switzerland then than you had
Then you dont come regularly
I have never seen either Germany or Switzerland before
I have scarcely been out of England before
Why nowhe paused to think briefly upon his wordsI took it for granted you were showing Miss Madden around
It s quite the other way about she answered with a cold little laugh
It is she who is showing me around
It is her tour
I am the chaperone
Thorpe dwelt upon the word in his mind
He understood what it meant only in a way but he was luminously clear as to the bitterness of the tone in which it had been uttered
Noit didnt seem as if it were altogetherwhat I might callYOUR tour he ventured
They had seen much of each other these past few days but it was still hard for him to make sure whether their freedom of intercourse had been enlarged
The slight shrug of the shoulders with which in silence she commented upon his remark embarrassed him
For a moment he said nothing
He went on then with a renewed consciousness of risk
You mustnt be annoyed with me he urged
Ive been travelling with that dear little niece of mine and her brother so long that Ive got into a habit of watching to notice if the faces I see round me are happy
And when theyre not then I have a kind of fatherly notion of interfering and seeing whats wrong
She smiled faintly at this but when he added upon doubtful inspirationBy the way speaking of fathers I didnt know at Hadlow that you were the daughter of one of my Directorsthis smile froze upon the instant
The Dent du Midi is more impressive from the hotel dont you think
she remarked than it is from here
Upon consideration he resolved to go forward
I have taken a great interest in General Kervick he said almost defiantly
I am seeing to it that he has a comfortable incomean income suitable to a gentleman of his positionfor the rest of his life
He will be very glad of it she remarked
But I hoped that you would be glad of it too he told her bluntly
A curious sense of reliance upon his superiority in years had come to him
If he could make his air elderly and paternal enough it seemed likely that she would defer to it
Im talking to you as I would to my niece you know he added plausibly
She turned her head to make a fleeting survey of his face as if the point of view took her by surprise
I dont understand she said
You are providing an income for my father because you wish to speak to me like an uncle
Is that it
He laughed somewhat disconsolately
Nothat isnt it he said and laughed again
I couldnt tell you know that you wouldnt want to talk about your father
Why theres no reason in the world for not talking of him she made haste to declare
And if hes got something good in the City Im sure Im as glad as anyone
He is the sort that ought always to have a good deal of money
I mean it will bring out his more amiable qualities
He does not shine much in adversityany more than I do
Thorpe felt keenly that there were fine things to be said herebut he had confidence in nothing that came to his tongue
Ive been a poor man all my lifetill now was his eventual remark
Please dont tell me that you have been very happy in your poverty she adjured him with the dim flicker of a returning smile
Very likely there are people who are so constituted but they are not my kind
I dont want to hear them tell about it
To me poverty is the horrorthe unmentionable horror
There never was a day that I didnt feel THAT
Thorpe put fervour into his voice
I was never reconciled to it for a minute
I never ceased swearing to myself that Id pull myself out of it
And thats what makes me sort of softhearted now toward those toward those who havent pulled themselves out of it
Your niece says you are softhearted beyond example remarked Lady Cressage
Who could help being to such a sweet little girl as she is
demanded the uncle fondly
She is very nice said the other
If one may say such a thing I fancy these three months with her have had an appreciable effect upon you
Im sure I note a difference
Thats just what Ive been saying to myself
he told her
He was visibly delighted with this corroboration
Ive been alone practically all my life
I had no friends to speak ofI had no fit companyI hadnt anything but the determination to climb out of the hole
Well Ive done thatand Ive got among the kind of people that I naturally like
But then there came the question of whether they would like me
I tell you frankly that was what was worrying the heart out of me when I first met you
I like to be confessing it to you nowbut you frightened me within an inch of my life
Well now you see Im not scared of you at all
And of course its because Julias been putting me through a course of sprouts
The figure was lost upon Lady Cressage but the spirit of the remarks seemed not unpleasant to her
Im sure youre full of kindness she said
You must forget that I snapped at youabout papa
All I remember about that is he began his eye lighting up with the thought that this time the opportunity should not pass unimproved that you said he didnt shine much in adversityany more than you did
Now on that last point I disagree with you straight
There wouldnt be any place in which you wouldnt shine
Is that the way one talks to ones niece
she asked him almost listlessly
Such flattery must surely be bad for the young
Her words were sprightly enough but her face had clouded over
She had no heart for the banter
Ahhe halfgroaned
I only wish I knew what was the right way to talk to you
The real thing is that I see youre unhappyand that gets on my nerveand I should like to ask you if there wasnt something I could doand ask it in such a way that youd have to admit there wasand I dont know enough to do it
He had a wan smile for thanks
But of course there is nothing she replied gently
Oh there must be
he insisted
He had no longer any clear notions as to where his tongue might not lead him
There must be
You said I might talk to you as I would to Julia Did I
Well Im going to anyway he went on stoutly ignoring the note of definite dissent in her interruption
You ARE unhappy
You spoke about being a chaperone
Well now to speak plainly if it isnt entirely pleasant for you with Miss Maddenwhy wouldnt you be a chaperone for Julia
I must be going to London very soonbut she can stay here or go to Egypt or wherever she likesand of course you would do everything and have everythingwhatever you liked too
The conversation is getting upon rather impossible grounds Im afraid she said and then bit her lips together
Halting she frowned a little in the effort of considering her further words but there was nothing severe in the glance which she lifted to him as she began to speak
Let us walk on
I must tell you that you misconceive the situation entirely
Nobody could possibly be kinder or more considerate than Miss Madden
Of course she is Americanor rather IrishAmerican and Im English and our notions and ways are not always alike
But that has nothing to do with it
And it is not so much that she has many thousands a year and I only a few hundreds
That in itself would signify nothingand if I must take help from somebody I would rather take it from Celia Madden than anybody else I knowbut this is the point Mr Thorpe
I do not eat the bread of dependence gracefully
I pull wry faces over it and I dont try very much to disguise them
That is my fault
Yesoh yes I know it is a faultbut I am as I am
And if Miss Madden doesnt mindwhyshe concluded with a mirthless uncertain laughwhy on earth should you
Ah why should I
he echoed reflectively
I should like desperately to tell you why
Sometime I will tell you
They walked on in silence for a brief space
Then she put out her hand for her wrap and as she paused he spread it over her shoulders
I am amazed to think what we have been saying to each other she said buttoning the fur as they moved on again
I am vexed with myself
And more still with me he suggested
Noobut I ought to be
Youve made me talk the most shocking rubbish
There we disagree again you know
Everything youve saids been perfect
What youre thinking of now is that Im not an old enough friend to have been allowed to hear it
But if Im not as old a friend as some I wish I could make you feel that Im as solid a friend as anyas solid and as staunch and as true
I wish I could hear you say you believed that
But you talk of friends she said in a tone not at all responsivewhat is meant by friends
Weve chanced to meet twiceand once we barely exchanged civilities and this time weve been hotel acquaintanceshardly more is itand you and your young people have been very polite to meand I in a silly moment have talked to you more about my affairs than I shouldI suppose it was because you mentioned my father
But friends is rather a big word for that isnt it
Thorpe pouted for a dubious moment
I can think of a bigger word still he said daringly
Its been on the tip of my tongue more than once
She quickened her pace
The air had grown perceptibly colder
The distant mountains visible ever and again through the bare branches were of a dark and cheerless blue and sharply defined against the sky
It was not yet the sunset hour and there were no mists but the light of day seemed to be going out of the heavens
He hurried on beside her in depressed silence
Their companions were hidden from view in a convolution of the winding road but they were so near that their voices could be heard as they talked
Frequently the sound of laughter came backward from them
Theyre jolly enough down there he commented at last moodily
Thats a good reason for our joining them isnt it
Her tone was at once casual and pointed
But I dont want to join them
he protested
Why dont you stay with meand talk
But you bully me so she offered in explanation
The phrase caught his attention
Could it be that it expressed her real feeling
She had said he recalled that he had made her talk
Her complaint was like an admission that he could overpower her will
If that were truethen he had resources of masterfulness still in reserve sufficient to win any victory
Nonot bully you he said slowly as if objecting to the word rather than the idea
That wouldnt be possible to me
But you dont know me well enough to understand me
I am the kind of man who gets the things he wants
Let me tell you something When I was at Hadlow I had never shot a pheasant in my life
I used to do tolerably well with a rifle but I hardly knew anything about a shotgun and I dont suppose Id ever killed more than two or three birds on the wingand that was ages ago
But I took the notion that I would shoot better than anybody else there
I made up my mind to itand I simply did it thats all
I dont know if you rememberbut I killed a good deal more than both the others put together
I give you that as an example
I wanted you to think that I was a crack shotand so I made myself be a crack shot
That is very interesting she murmured
They did not seem to be walking quite so fast
Dont think I want to brag about myself he went on
I dont fancy myselfin that way
Im not specially proud of doing thingsits the things themselves that I care for
If some men had made a great fortune they would be conceited about it
Well Im not
What Im keen about is the way to use that fortune so that I will get the most out of itthe most happiness I mean
The thing to do is to make up your mind carefully what it is that you want and to put all your power and resolution into getting itand the rest is easy enough
I dont think theres anything beyond a strong mans reach if he only believes enough in himself
But arent you confusing two things
she queried
The subject apparently interested her
To win ones objects by sheer personal force is one thing
To merely secure them because ones purse is longer than other peoplesthats quite another matter
He smiled grimly at her
Well Ill combine the two he said
Then I suppose you will be altogether irresistible she said lightly
There will be no pheasants left for other people at all
I dont mind being chaffed he told her with gravity
So long as youre goodnatured you can make game of me all you like
But Im in earnest all the same
Im not going to play the fool with my money and my power
I have great projects
Sometime Ill tell you about them
They will all be put throughevery one of them
And you wouldnt object to talking them over with mewould you
My opinion on projects is of no earthly valueto myself or anyone else
But still youd give me your advice if I asked it
he persisted
Especially if it was a project in which you were concerned
After a moments constrained silence she said to him You must have no projects Mr Thorpe in which I am concerned
This talk is all very wide of the mark
You are not entitled to speak as if I were mixed up with your affairs
There is nothing whatever to warrant it
But how can you help being in my projects if I put you there and keep you there
he asked her with gleeful boldness
And just ask yourself whether you do really want to help it
Why should you
Youve seen enough of me to know that I can be a good friend
And Im the kind of friend who amounts to somethingwho can and will do things for those he likes
What obligation are you under to turn away that kind of a friend when he offers himself to you
Put that question plainly to yourself
But you are not in a position to nominate the questions that I am to put to myself she said
The effort to import decision into her tone and manner was apparent
That is what I desire you to understand
We must not talk any more about me
I am not the topic of conversation
But first let me finish what I wanted to say he insisted
My talk wont break any bones
Youd be wrong not to listen to itbecause its meant to help youto be of use to you
This is the thing Lady Cressage Youre in a particularly hard and unpleasant position
Like my friend Plowdenhe watched her face narrowly but in vain in the dull light for any change at mention of the namelike my friend Plowden you have a position and title to keep up and next to nothing to keep it up on
But he can go down into the City and make moneyor try to
He can accept Directorships and tips about the market and so on from men who are disposed to be good to him and who see how he can be of use to themand in that way he can do something for himself
But there is the difference you cant do these things or you think you cant which is the same thing
Youre all fenced in youre surrounded by noticeboards telling you that you mustnt walk this way or look that way that you mustnt say this thing or do the other
Now your friend down ahead thereMiss Maddenshe doesnt take much stock in noticeboards
In fact she feeds the gulls simply because shes forbidden to do it
But youyou dont feed any gulls and yet youre annoyed with yourself that you dont
Isnt that the case
Havent I read you right
She seemed to have submitted to his choice of a topic
There was no touch of expostulation in the voice with which she answered him
I see what you think you mean she said
Think
he responded with selfconfident emphasis
Im not thinking
Im reading an open book
As I say youre not contentedyoure not happy you dont try to pretend that you are
But all the same though you hate it you accept it
You think that you really must obey your noticeboards
Now what I tell you you ought to do is to take a different view
Why should you put up all this barbed wire between yourself and your friends
It doesnt do anybody else any goodand it does you harm
Why for example should Plowden be free to take things from me and you not
She glanced at him with a cold halfsmile in her eye
Unfortunately I was not asked to join your Board
He pressed his lips tightly together and regarded her meditatively as he turned these words over in his mind
What Im doing for Plowden he said with slow vagueness meanwhile it isnt so much because hes on the Board
Hes of no special use to me there
But he was nice to me at a time when that meant everything in the world to meand I dont forget things of that sort
Besides I like himand it pleases me to let him in for a share of my good fortune
See
Its my way of enjoying myself
Well now I like you too and why shouldnt I be allowed to let you in also for a share of that good fortune
You think theres a difference but I tell you its imaginarypure moonshine
Why the very people whose opinion youre afraid ofwhat did they do themselves when the South African craze was on
Im told that the scum of the earth had only to own some Chartered shares and pretend to be in the know about themand they could dine with as many duchesses as they liked
I knew one or two of the men who were in that dealI wouldnt have them in my housebut it seems there wasnt any other house they couldnt go to in London
Oh yes there were many houses she interposed
It wasnt a nice exhibition that society made of itself one admits thatbut it was only one set that quite lost their heads
There are all kinds of sets you know
AndI dont think I see your application in any event
The craze as you call it was all on a business basis
People ran after those who could tell them which shares were going up and they gambled in those shares
That was all wasnt it
Still looking intently at her he dismissed her query with a little shake of the head
On a business basis he repeated as if talking to himself
They like to have things on a business basis
He halted with a hand held out over her arm and she paused as well in a reluctant tentative way
I dont understand you she remarked blankly
Let me put it in this way he began knitting his brows and marshalling the thoughts and phrases with which his mind had been busy
This is the question
You were saying that you werent asked to join my Board
You explained in that way how I could do things for Plowden and couldnt do them for you
Oh I know it was a jokebut it had its meaningat least to me
Now I want to ask youif I decide to form another Company a very small and particular Companyif I should decide to form it I saycould I come to you and ask you to join THAT Board
Of course I could askbut what I mean iswell I guess you know what I mean
The metaphor had seemed to him a most ingenious and satisfactory vehicle for his purpose and it had broken down under him amid evidences of confusion which he could not account for
All at once his sense of physical ascendancy had melted awaydisappeared
He looked at Lady Cressage for an instant and knew there was something shuffling and nerveless in the way his glance then shifted to the dim mountain chain beyond
His heart fluttered surprisingly inside his breast during the silence which ensued
Surely you must have said everything now that you wished to say she observed at last
She had been studying intently the trodden snow at her feet and did not even now look up
The constraint of her manner and a certain pleading hesitation in her words began at once to restore his selfcommand
Do not talk of it any further I beg of you she went on
Wewe have been lagging behind unconscionably
If you wish to please me let us hurry forward now
And pleaseno more talk at all
But just a wordyoure not angry
She shook her head very slightly
And you do know that Im your friendyour solid twentyfourcarat friend
After a moments pause she made answer almost in a whisperYesbe my friendif it amuses youand led the way with precipitate steps down the winding road
CHAPTER XIII TWO days later Thorpe and his young people took an early morning train for Genevahomeward bound
It was entirely easy to accept their uncles declaration that urgent business summoned him to London yet Julia and Alfred when they chanced to exchange glances after the announcement read in each others eyes the formless impression that there were other things beside business
Their uncle they realized must be concerned in large and probably venturesome enterprises but it did not fit with their conception of his character that commercial anxieties should possess the power to upset him
And upset he undeniably was
They traced his disturbance in a general way to the morning following the excursion up to Glion and Caux
He told them then that he had slept very badly and that they must count him out of their plans for the day
He continued to be counted out of what remained of their stay at Territet
He professed not to be ill but he was restless and preoccupied
He ate little but smoked continuously and drank spirits a good deal which they had not seen him do before
Nothing would induce him to go out either day
Strangely enough this disturbance of their uncles equanimity synchronized with an apparent change in the attitude of their new friends on the floor below
This change was indeed more apparent than definable
The ladies were to the nicest scrutiny as kindly and affable as ever but the sense of comradeship had somehow vanished
Insensibly the two parties had ceased to have impulses and tastes in common
There were no more trips togetherno more fortuitous luncheons or formal dinners as a group
The young people looked up at the front of the big hotel on this morning of departure after they had clambered over the drifts into the snowbedecked train and opened the window of their compartment
They made sure that they could identify the windows of Miss Maddens suite and that the curtains were drawn asidebut there was no other token of occupancy discernible
They had said goodbye to the two ladies the previous evening of courseit lingered in their minds as a rather perfunctory ceremonybut this had not prevented their hoping for another farewell glimpse of their friends
No one came to wave a hand from the balcony however and the youngsters looked somewhat dubiously at each other as the train moved
Then intuitively they glanced toward their uncleand perceived that he had his hat pulled over his eyes and was staring with a kind of moody scowl at the lake opposite
Fortunately it is a clear day said Julia
We shall see Mont Blanc
Her voice seemed to have a hollow and unnatural sound in her own ears
Neither her uncle nor her brother answered her
At breakfast meanwhile in the apartment toward which the young people had turned their farewell gaze in vain Miss Madden sipped her coffee thoughtfully while she read a letter spread upon the table beside her
Its as they said she observed
You are not allowed to drive in the mountains with your own horses and carriage
That seems rather quaint for a model Republicdoesnt it
I daresay theyre quite right Lady Cressage replied listlessly
Its in the interest of safety
People who do not know the mountains would simply go and get killed in avalanches and hurricanesand all that
I suppose that is what the Government wishes to prevent
And youre on the side of the Government said the other with a twinkle in her brown eyes
Truly nowyou hated the whole idea of driving over the Simplon
Lady Cressage lifted her brows in whimsical assent as she nodded
But do you like this Russian plan any better
demanded Celia
I wish for once you would be absolutely candid and open with meand let me know to the uttermost just what you think
For once
queried the other
Her tone was placid enough but she allowed the significance of the quotation to be marked
Oh I never wholly know what youre thinking Miss Madden declared
She put on a smile to alleviate the force of her remarks
It is not you aloneEdith
Dont think that
But it is ingrained in your countrywomen
You cant help it
Its in your blood to keep things back
Ive met numbers of English ladies who Im ready to believe would be incapable of telling an untruth
But Ive never met one of whom I could be sure that she would tell me the whole truth
Dont you see this case in point she pursued with a little laugh I could not drag it out of you that you disliked the Simplon idea so long as there was a chance of our going
Immediately we find that we cant go you admit that you hated it
But you wanted to go objected Lady Cressage quietly
That was the important thing
What I wanted or did not want had nothing to do with the matter
Celias face clouded momentarily
Those are not the kind of things I like to hear you say she exclaimed with a certain vigour
They put everything in quite a false light
I am every whit as anxious that you should be pleased as that I should
You know that well enough
Ive said it a thousand timesand have I ever done anything to disprove it
But I never can find out what you do wantwhat really will please you
You never will propose anything you never will be entirely frank about the things I propose
Its only by watching you out of the corner of my eye that I can ever guess whether anything is altogether to your liking or not
The discussion seemed to be following lines familiar to them both
That is only another way of saying what you discovered long ago said Lady Cressage passivelythat I am deficient in the enthusiasms
But originally you were of the opinion that you had enthusiasms enough for two and that my lack of them would redress the balance so to speak
I thought it was a very logical opinion then and from my own point of view I think so now
But if it does not work in practice at least the responsibility of defending it is not mine
Delightful
cried Celia smiling gayly as she put down her cup again
You are the only woman Ive ever known who was worth arguing with
The mere operation makes me feel as if I were going through Oxfordor passing the final Jesuit examinations
Heaven knows I would get up arguments with you every day for the pure enjoyment of the thingif I werent eternally afraid of saying something that would hurt your feelings and then you wouldnt tell me but would nurse the wound in silence in the dark and I should know that something was wrong and have to watch you for weeks to make out what it wasand it would all be too unhappy
But it comes back you see to what I said before
You dont tell me things
Edith smiled in turn affectionately enough but with a wistful reserve
It is a constitutional defecteven national according to you
How shall I hope to change at this late day
But what is it you want me to tell youI forget
The Russian thing
To go to Vienna where we get our passports and then to Cracow and through to Kief which they say is awfully well worth whileand next Moscowand so on to St Petersburg in time to see the ice break up
It is only in winter that you see the characteristic Russia that one has always heard
With the furs and the sledges and the three horses galloping over the snowit seems to me it must be the best thing in Europeif you can call Russia Europe
Thats the way it presents itself to mebut then I was brought up in a halfArctic climate and I love that sort of thingin its proper season
It is different with you
In England you dont know what a real winter is
And so I have to make quite sure that you think you would like the Russian experiment
The other laughed gently
But if I dont know what a real winter is how can I tell whether I will like it or not
All I do know is that I am perfectly willing to go and find out
Oh yestrulyI should like very much to go
Miss Madden sighed briefly
All right she said but with a notable absence of conviction in her tone
A space of silence ensued as she opened and glanced through another note the envelope of which had borne no postmark
She pouted her lips over the contents of this missive and raised her eyebrows in token of surprise but as she laid it down she looked with a frank smile at her companion
Its from our young friend she explained genially the painterboyMr DAubigny
It is to remind me of a promise he says I madethat when I came to London he should paint my portrait
I dont think I promised anything of the kindbut I suppose that is a detail
Its all my unfortunate hair
They must have gone by this timethey were to go very early werent they
Lady Cressage glanced at the clock
It was 840 I thinkfully half an hour ago she answered with a painstaking effect of indifference
Curious conglomerationmused the other
The boy and girl are so civilized and their uncle is so rudimentary
Im afraid they are spoiling him just as the missionaries spoil the noble savage
They ought to go away and leave him alone
As a barbarian he was rather effectivebut they will whitewash him and gild him and make a tame monstrosity of him
But I suppose its inevitable
Having made his fortune it is the rule that he must set up as a gentleman
We do it more simply in America
One generation makes the fortune and leaves it to the next generation to put on the frills
My father for example never altered in the slightest degree the habits he formed when he was a poor workman
To the day of his death blessed old man he remained what he had always beensimple pious modest hardworking kindly and thriftya model peasant
Nothing ever tempted him a hairsbreadth out of the path he had been bred to walk in
But such nobility of mind and temper with it all
He never dreamed of suggesting that I should walk in the same path
From my earliest childhood I cannot remember his ever putting a limitation upon me that wasnt entirely sensible and generous
I must have been an extremely trying daughter but he never said so he never looked or acted as if he thought soBut I never stop when I begin talking of my father
Its always very sweet to me to hear you talk of him Lady Cressage put in
One knows so few people who feel that way about their fathers
Celia nodded gravely as if in benevolent comment upon something that had been left unsaid
The sight of the young artists note recalled her earlier subject
Of course there is a certain difference she went on carelesslythis Mr Thorpe is not at all a peasant as the phrase goes
He strikes one sometimes as having been educated
Oh he was at a public school Lord Plowden tells me said the other with interest
And his people were booksellerssomewhere in Londonso that he got a good smattering of literature and all that
He certainly has more right to set up as a gentleman than nine out of ten of the nouveaux riches one sees flaunting about nowadays
And he can talk very well indeedin a direct practical sort of way
I dont quite follow you about his niece and nephew spoiling him
Of course one can see that they have had a great effect upon him
He sees it himselfand hes very proud of it
He told me so quite frankly
But why shouldnt it be a nice effect
Oh I dont know Celia replied idly
It seemed to me that he was the kind of piratical buccaneer who oughtnt to be shaved and polished and taught drawingroom tricksI feel that merely in the interest of the fitness of things
Have you looked into his eyesI mean when theyve got that lacklustre expression
You can see a hundred thousand dead men in them
I know the look you mean said Lady Cressage in a low voice
Not that I assume he is going to kill anybody pursued Miss Madden with ostensible indifference but fixing a glance of aroused attention upon her companions face or that he has any criminal intentions whatever
He behaves very civilly indeed and apparently his niece and nephew idolize him
He seems to be the soul of kindness to them
It may be that Im altogether wrong about himonly I know I had the instinct of alarm when I caught that sort of dull glaze in his eye
I met an African explorer a year ago or so about whose expeditions dark stories were told and he had precisely that kind of eye
Perhaps it was this that put it into my headbut I have a feeling that this Thorpe is an exceptional sort of man who would have the capacity in him for terrible things if the necessity arose for them
I see what you mean the other repeated
She toyed with the breadcrumbs about her plate and reflectively watched their manipulation into squares and triangles as she went on
But may that not be merely the visible sign of an exceptionally strong and masterful character
And isnt it after all the result of circumstances whether such a character makes as you put it a hundred thousand dead men or enriches a hundred thousand lives instead
We agree let us say that this Mr Thorpe impresses us both as a powerful sort of personality
The question arises How will he use his power
On that point we look for evidence
You see a dull glaze in his eye and you draw hostile conclusions from it
I reply that it may mean no more than that he is sleepy
But on the other hand I bring proofs that are actively in his favour
He is as you say idolized by the only two members of his family that we have seenpersons moreover who have been brought up in ways different to his own and who would not start therefore with prejudices in his favour
Beyond that I know of two cases in which he has behaved or rather undertaken to behave with really lavish generosityand in neither case was there any claim upon him of a substantial nature
He seems to me in fact quite too much disposed to share his fortune with Tom Dick and Harryanybody who excites his sympathy or gets into his affections
Having said this much Lady Cressage swept the crumbs aside and looked up
So now she added with a flushed smile since you love arguments so much how do you answer that
Celia smiled back
Oh I dont answer it at all she said and her voice carried a kind of quizzical implication
Your proofs overwhelm me
I know nothing of himand you know so much
Lady Cressage regarded her companion with a novel earnestness and directness of gaze
I had a long long talk with himthe afternoon we came down from Glion
Miss Madden rose and going to the mantel lighted a cigarette
She did not return to the table but after a brief pause came and took an easychair beside her friend who turned to face her
My dear Edith she said with gravity I think you want to tell me about that talkand so I beg you to do so
But if Im mistakenwhy then I beg you to do nothing of the kind
The other threw out her hands with a gesture of wearied impatience and then clasped them upon her knee
I seem not to know what I want
What is the good of talking about it
What is the good of anything
Nownow
Celias assumption of a monitors tone had reference apparently to something understood between the two for Lady Cressage deferred to it and even summoned the ghost of a smile
There is really nothing to tell she faltered hesitatingly that is nothing happened
I dont know how to say itthe talk left my mind in a whirl
I couldnt tell you why
It was no particular thing that was saidit seemed to be more the things that I thought of while something else was being talked aboutbut the whole experience made a most tremendous impression upon me
Ive tried to straighten it out in my own mind but I can make nothing of it
That is what disturbs me Celia
No man has ever confused me in this silly fashion before
Nothing could be more idiotic
Im supposed to hold my own in conversation with people ofwell with people of a certain intellectual rankbut this man who is of hardly any intellectual rank at all and who rambled on without any special aim that one could seehe reduced my brain to a sort of porridge
I said the most extraordinary things to himbabbling rubbish which a schoolgirl would be ashamed of
How is that to be accounted for
I try to reason it out but I cant
Can you
Nerves said Miss Madden judicially
Oh that is meaningless the other declared
Anybody can say nerves
Of course all human thought and action is nerves
But yours is a special case of nerves Celia pursued with gentle imperturbability
I think I can make my meaning clear to youthough the parallel isnt precisely an elegant one
The finest thoroughbred dog in the world if it is beaten viciously and cowed in its youth will always have a latent taint of nervousness apprehension timiditycall it what you like
Well it seems to me theres something like that in your case Edith
They hurt you too cruelly poor girl
I wont say it broke your nervebut it made a flaw in it
Just as a soldiers old wound aches when theres a storm in the airso your old hurt distracts and upsets you under certain psychological conditions
Its a rather clumsy explanation but I think it does explain
PerhapsI dont know Edith replied in a tone of melancholy reverie
It makes a very poor creature out of me whatever it is
I rather lose patience Edith her companion admonished her gravely
Nobody has a right to be so deficient in courage as you allow yourself to be
But Im not a coward the other protested
I could be as brave as anybodyas brave as you areif a chance were given me
But of what use is bravery against a wall twenty feet high
I cant get over it
I only wound and cripple myself by trying to tear it down or break through itOh yes I know what you say
You say there is no wallthat it is all an illusion of mine
But unfortunately Im unable to take that view
Ive battered myself against it too longtoo sorely Celia
Celia shrugged her shoulders in comment
Oh we women all have our wallsour limitationsif it comes to that she said with a kind of compassionate impatience in her tone
We are all ridiculous togetherfrom the point of view of human liberty
The free woman is a frauda myth
She is as empty an abstraction as the Liberty Equality Fraternity that the French put on their public buildings
I used to have the most wonderful visions of what independence would mean
I thought that when I was absolutely my own master with my money and my courage and my free mind I would do things to astonish all mankind
But really the most I achieve is the occasional mild surprise of a German waiter
Even that palls on one after a time
And if you were independent Edithif you had any amount of moneywhat difference do you think it would make to you
What could you do that you dont do or couldnt do now
Ah nowsaid the other looking up with a thin smilenow is an intervalan oasis
Miss Maddens large handsome clearhued face habitually serene in its expression lost something in composure as she regarded her companion
I dont know why you should say that she observed gently enough but with an effect of reproof in her tone
I have never put limits to the connection in my own mindand it hadnt occurred to me that you were doing so in yours
But Im not interposed Lady Cressage
Then I understand you less than ever
Why do you talk about an interval
What was the other word oasisas if this were a brief halt for refreshments and a breathingspell and that presently you must wander forth into the desert again
That suggestion is none of mine
We agreed that we would live togetherpool our issues as they say in America
I wanted a companion so did you
I have never for an instant regretted the arrangement
Some of my own shortcomings in the matter I have regretted
You were the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen and you were talented and you seemed to like meand I promised myself that I would add cheerfulness and a gay spirit to your other giftsand in that I have failed wofully
Youre not happy
I see that only too clearly
I knowIm a weariness and a bore to you broke in the other despondingly
That is precisely what youre not Celia went on
We mustnt use words of that sort
They dont describe anything in our life at all
But I should be better pleased with myself if I could really put my finger on what it is that is worrying you
Even if we decided to break up our establishment I have told you that you should not go back to what you regard as poverty
Upon that score I had hoped that your mind was easy
As I say I think you attach more importance to money than those who have tested its powers would agree tobut thats neither here nor there
You did not get on well on 600 pounds a yearand that is enough
You shall never have less than twice that amount whether we keep together or notand if it ought to be three times the amount that doesnt matter
You dont seem to realize Edithshe spoke with increased animationthat you are my caprice
You are the possession that I am proudest of and fondest of
There is nothing else that appeals to me a hundredth part as much as you do
Since I became independent the one real satisfaction I have had is in being able to do things for youto have you with me and make you share in the best that the world can offer
And if with it all you remain unhappy why then you see I dont know what to do
Oh I knowI behave very badly
Lady Cressage had risen and with visible agitation began now to pace the room
I deserve to be thrown into the lakeI know it well enough
But CeliatrulyIm as incapable of understanding it as you are
It must be that I am possessed by devilslike the people in the New Testament
Perhaps someone will come along who can cast them out
I dont seem able to do it myself
I cant rule myself at all
It needs a strength I havent got
Ah
said Celia thoughtfully
The excited sentences which Edith threw over her shoulder as she walked appeared upon examination to contain a suggestion
My dear child she asked abruptly after a moments silence do you want to marry
Lady Cressage paused at the mantel and exchanged a long steadfast glance with her friend
Then she came slowly forward
Ah that is what I dont know she answered
Apparently the reply was candid
Miss Madden pursed her lips and frowned a little in thought
Then at some passing reflection she smiled in a puzzled fashion
At last she also rose and went to the mantel for another cigarette
Now I am going to talk plainly she said with decision
Since the subject is mentioned less harm will be done by speaking out than by keeping still
There is a debate in your mind on the matter isnt there
The other lady tall slender gently ruminative once more stood at the window and with bowed head looked down at the lake
YesI suppose it might be called that she replied in a low voice
And you hesitate to tell me about it
You would rather not
Celia after an instants pause went on without waiting for an answer
I beg that you wont assume my hostility to the idea Edith
In fact Im not sure I dont think it would be the best thing for you to do
Marriage a home childrenthese are great things to a woman
We can say that she pays the price of bondage for thembut to know what that signifies we must ask what her freedom has been worth to her
Yes interposed the other from the window
What have I done with my freedom that has been worth while
Not much murmured Celia under her breath
She moved forward and stood beside Edith with an arm round her waist
They looked together at the lake
It is Lord Plowden is it not
asked the American as the silence grew constrained
Lady Cressage looked up alertly and then hesitated over her reply
No she said at last
Upon reflection and with a dim smile flickering in her sidelong glance at Celia she added He wants to marry you you know
Leave that out of consideration said Celia composedly
He has never said so
I think it was more his mothers idea than his if it existed at all
Of course I am not marrying him or anybody else
But I saw at Hadlow that you and he werewhat shall I sayold friends
He must marry money the other replied
In an unexpected burst of candour she went on He would have asked me to marry him if I had had money
There is no harm in telling you that
It was quite understoodoh two years ago
And I think I wished I had the moneythen
And you dont wish it now
A slight shake of Ediths small shapely head served for answer
After a little she spoke in a musing tone He is going to have money of his own very soon but I dont think it would attract me now
I like him personally of course butthere is no career no ambition no future
A Viscount has future enough behind him observed Celia
It doesnt attract me the other repeated vaguely
He is handsome and clever and kind and all thatbut he would never appeal to any of the great emotionsnor be capable of them himself He is too smooth too wellbalanced too much the gentleman
That expresses it badlybut do you see what I mean
Celia turned and studied the beautiful profile beside her in a steady comprehending look
Yes I think I see what you mean she said with significance in her tone
Lady Cressage flushed and released herself from her companions arm
But I dont know myself what I mean
she exclaimed despairingly as she moved away
I dont knowI dont know
CHAPTER XIV ON the last day of February Mrs Dabney was surprised if not exhilarated by a visit from her two children in the little bookshop
Its the last day in the world that I should have thought youd a come out on she told them in salutationand for comment they all glanced along the dark narrow alley of shelves to the street window
A gloomy spectacle it was indeed with a cold rain slanting through the discredited remnants of a fog which the east wind had broken up but could not drive away and with only now and again a passerby moving across the dim vista masked beneath an umbrella or bent forward with chin buried in turnedup collar
In the doorway outside the sulky boy stamped his feet and slapped his sides with his arms in pantomimic mutiny against the task of guarding the bookstalls dripping covers which nobody would be mad enough to pause over much less to lift
I dont know but Id ought to let the boy bring in the books and go home she said as their vague gaze was attracted by his gestures
But it isnt three yetit seems ridiculous to close up
Still if youd be more comfortable upstairs Why mamma
The idea of making strangers of us protested Julia
She strove to make her tone cheerful but its effect of rebuke was unmistakable
The mother leaning against the tall desk looked blankly at her daughter
The pallid flicker of the gasjet overhead made her long listless face seem more devoid of colour than ever
But you are as good as strangers arent you
she observed coldly
Youve been back in town ten days and more and Ive scarcely laid eyes upon either of you
But dont you want to sit down
You can put those parcels on the floor anywhere
Or shall I do it for you
Alfred had been lounging in the shadowed corner against a heap of old magazines tied in bundles
He sprang up now and cleared the chair but his sister declined it with a gesture
Her small figure had straightened itself into a kind of haughty rigidity
There has been so much to do mamma she explained in a clear cool voice
We have had hundreds of things to buy and to arrange about
All the responsibility for the housekeeping rests upon meand Alfred has his studio to do
But of course we should have looked in upon you soonerand much oftenerif we had thought you wanted us
But really when we came to you the very day after our return it was impossible for us to pretend that you were glad to see us
Oh I was glad enough Mrs Dabney made answer mechanically
Why shouldnt I be glad
And why should you think I wasnt glad
Did you expect me to shout and dance
But you said you wouldnt come to see us in Ovington Square Alfred reminded her
Thats different she declared
What would I be doing in Ovington Square
Its all right for you to be there
I hope youll be happy there
But it wouldnt add anything to your happiness to have me there it would be quite the other way about
I know that if you DONT
This is my place here and I intend to stick to it
Julias bright eyes scanning the apathetic stubborn maternal countenance hardened beyond their wont
You talk as if there had been some class war declared she said with obvious annoyance
You know that Uncle Stormont would like nothing better than to be as nice to you as he is to us
Uncle Stormont
Mrs Dabneys repetition of the words was surcharged with hostile sarcasm
But his name was Stormont as much as it was Joel broke in Alfred from his dark corner
He has a perfect right to use the one he likes best
Oh I dont dispute his right she replied once more in her passionless monotone
Everybody can call themselves whatever they please
Its no affair of mine
You and your sister spell your fathers name in a way to suit yourselves I never interfered did I
You have your own ideas and your own tastes
They are quite beyond mebut theyre all right for you
I dont criticize them at all
What I say is that it is a great mercy your uncle came along with his pockets full of money to enable you to make the most of them
If I were religious I should call that providential
And thats what we DO call it put in Julia with vivacity
And why should you shut your doors against this Providence mamma
Just think of it
We dont insist upon your coming to live at Ovington Square at all
Probably as you say you would be happier by yourselfat least for the present
But when Uncle Stwhen uncle says theres more than enough money for us all and is only too anxious for you to let him do things for youwhy hes your own brother
Its as if I should refuse to allow Alfred to do things for me
That you never did interposed the young man gayly
Ill say that for you Jule
And never will she assured him with cheerful decision
But nomammacant you see what we mean
We have done what you wanted us to do
You sent us both to much better schools than you could afford from the time we were of no age at alland when uncles money came you sent us to Cheltenham
We did you no discredit
We worked very well we behaved ourselves properly
We came back to you at last with fair reason to suppose that you would beI wont say proud but at least well satisfied with usand then it turned out that you didnt like us at all
I never said anything of the sort the mother declared with a touch of animation
Oh noyou never said it Julia admitted but what else can we think you mean
Our uncle sends for us to go abroad with him and you busy yourself getting me ready and having new frocks made and all thatand I never hear a suggestion that you dont want me to go But I did want you to go Mrs Dabney affirmed
Well then when I come backwhen we come back and tell you what splendid and generous plans uncle has made for us and how he has taken a beautiful furnished house and made it our home and so onwhy you wont even come and look at the house
But I dont want to see it the mother retorted obstinately
Well then you neednt
said Alfred rising
Nobody will ask you again
Oh yes they will urged Julia glancing meaningly from one to the other
All her life as it seemed she had been accustomed to mediate between these two unpliable and stubborn temperaments
From her earliest childhood she had understood somehow that there was a Dabney habit of mind which was by comparison soft and if not yielding then politic and set over against it there was a Thorpe temper full of gnarled and twisted hardnesses and tenacious as death
In the days of her grandfather Thorpe whom she remembered with an alarmed distinctness there had existed a kind of tacit idea that his name alone accounted for and justified the most persistent and stormy bad temper
That old man with the scowling brows bullied everybody suspected everybody apparently disliked everybody vehemently demanded his own will of everybodyand it was all to be explained seemingly by the fact that he was a Thorpe
After his disappearance from the sceneunlamented to the best of Julias juvenile perceptionsthere had been relatively peaceful times in the bookshop and the home overhead yet there had existed always a recognized line of demarcation running through the household
Julia and her fathera small hollowchested roundshouldered young man with a pale anxious face and ingratiating manner who had entered the shop as an assistant and remained as a soninlaw and was now the thinnest of unsubstantial memoriesJulia and this father had stood upon one side of this impalpable line as Dabneys otherwise as meek and tractable persons who would not expect to have their own way
Alfred and his mother were Thorpesthat is to say people who necessarily had their own way
Their domination was stained by none of the excesses which had rendered the grandfather intolerable
Their surface temper was in truth almost sluggishly pacific
Underneath however ugly currents and sharp rocks were well known to have a potential existenceand it was the mission of the Dabneys to see that no wind of provocation unduly stirred these depths
Worse even than these possibilities of violence however so far as everyday life was concerned was the strain of obstinacy which belonged to the Thorpe temper
A sort of passive mulishness it was impervious to argument immovable under the most sympathetic pressure which particularly tried the Dabney patience
It seemed to Julia now as she interposed her soothing influence between these jarring forces that she had spent whole years of her life in personal interventions of this sort
Oh yes they will she repeated and warned her brother into the background with a gesture halfpleading halfperemptory
We are your children and were not bad or undutiful children at all and Im sure that when you think it all over mamma youll see that it would be absurd to let anything come between you and us
How could I help letting it come
demanded the mother listlessly argumentative
You had outgrown me and my ways altogether
It was nonsense to suppose that you would have been satisfied to come back and live here again over the shop
I couldnt think for the life of me what I was going to do with you
But now your uncle has taken all that into his own hands
He can give you the kind of home that goes with your education and your ideasand what more do you want
Why should you come bothering me
How unjust you are mamma
cried Julia with a glaze of tears upon her bright glance
The widow took her elbow from the desk and slowly straightening herself looked down upon her daughter
Her long plain face habitually grave in expression conveyed no hint of exceptional emotion but the fingers of the large capable hands she clasped before her writhed restlessly against one another and there was a huskythreat of collapse in her voice as she spoke If you ever have children of your own she said and you slave your life out to bring them up so that theyll think themselves your betters and they act accordinglythen youll understand
But you dont understand nowand theres no good our talking any more about it
Come in whenever its convenientand you feel like it
I must go back to my books now
She took up a pen at this and opened the cashbook upon the blotter
Her children surveying her blankly found speech difficult
With some murmured words after a little pause they bestowed a perfunctory kiss upon her unresponsive cheek and filed out into the rain
Mrs Dabney watched them put up their umbrella and move off Strandward beneath it
She continued to look for a long time in an aimless ruminating way at the dismal prospect revealed by the window and the glass of the door
The premature night was closing in miserably with increasing rain and a doleful whistle of rising wind round the corner
At last she shut up the unconsidered cashbook lighted another gasjet and striding to the door rapped sharply on the glass
Bring everything in
she called to the boy and helped out his apprehension by a comprehensive gesture
Later when he had completed his task and one of the two narrow outlets from the shop in front was satisfactorily blocked with the wares from without and all the floor about reeked with the grimy drippings of the oilskins Mrs Dabney summoned him to the desk in the rear
I think you may go home now she said to him with the laconic abruptness to which he was so well accustomed
You have a home havent you
Remembering the exhaustive enquiries which the Mission people had made about him and his belongings as a preliminary to his getting this job he could not but be surprised at the mistresss question
In confusion he nodded assent and jerked his finger toward his cap
Got a mother
she pursued
Again he nodded with augmented confidence
And do you think yourself better than she is
The urchins dirty and unpleasant face screwed itself up in anxious perplexity over this strange query
Then it cleared as he thought he grasped the idea and the rateyes he lifted to her gleamed with the fell acuteness of the Dials
I shd be sorry if I wasnt he answered in swift rasping accents
Shes a rare old boozer she is
Its a fair curse to an honest boy like me to ave Go home
she bade him peremptorilyand frowned after him as he ducked and scuttled from the shop
Left to herself Mrs Dabney did not reopen the cash bookthe wretched day indeed had been practically a blank in its historybut loitered about in the waning light among the shelves near the desk altering the position of books here and there and glancing cursorily through others
Once or twice she went to the door and looked out upon the rainsoaked street
A tradesmans assistant opposite was rolling the iron shutters down for the night
If business in hats was over for the day how much more so in books
Her shop had never been fitted with shuttersfor what reason she could not guess
The opened pages of numerous volumes were displayed close against the window but no one had ever broken a pane to get at them
Apparently literature raised no desires in the criminal breast
To close the shop there was nothing to do but lock and bolt the door and turn out the lights
At last as the conviction of nightfall forced itself upon her from the drenched darkness outside she bent to put her hand to the key
Then with a little start of surprise she stood erect
Someone was shutting an umbrella in the doorway preparatory to entering the shop
It was her brother splashed and wet to the knees but with a glowing face who pushed his way in and confronted her with a broad grin
There was such a masterful air about him that when he jovially threw an arm round her gaunt waist and gathered her up against his moist shoulder she surprised herself by a halflaughing submission
Her vocabulary was not rich in phrases for this kind of emergency
Do mind what youre about
she told him flushing not unpleasurably
Shut up the place
he answered with lordly geniality
Ive walked all the way from the City in the rain
I wanted the exertionI couldnt have sat in a cab
Come back and build up the fire and lets have a talk
God
What things Ive got to tell you
There isnt any fire down here she said apologetically as they edged their way through the restricted alley to the rear
The old fireplace took up too much room
Sometimes in very sharp weather I have an oilstove in
Usually the gas warms it enough
You dont find it too colddo youwith your coat on
Or would you rather come upstairs
Never mind the cold he replied throwing a leg over the stool before the desk
I cant stay more n a minute or two
What do you think weve done today
Louisa had never in her life seen her brother look so well as he did now sprawling triumphantly upon the stool under the yellow gaslight
His strong heavilyfeatured face had somehow ceased to be commonplace
It had acquired an individual distinction of its own
He looked up at her with a clear bold eye in which despite its gloss of goodhumour she discerned a new authority
The nervous and apprehensive lines had somehow vanished from the countenance and with them oddly enough that lethargic heavy expression which had been their complement
He was all vigour readiness confidence now
She deemed him almost handsome this curious changeable brother of hers as he beat with his fist in a measured way upon the desktop to emphasize his words and fastened his commanding gaze upon her
We took very nearly twenty thousand pounds today he went on
This is the twentyeighth of February
A fortnight ago today was the first settlement
I wasnt here but Semple wasand the working of it is all in his hands
He kept as still as a mouse that first day
They had to deliver to us 26000 shares and they hadnt got one but we didnt make any fuss
The point was you see not to let them dream that they were caught in a trap
We didnt even put the price up to par
They had to come to Semple and say there didnt seem to be any shares obtainable just at the moment and what would he carry them over at
That means to let them postpone delivery for another fortnight
He was as smooth as sweetoil with them and agreed to carry them over till today without any charge at all
But today it was a little different
The price was up ten shillings above par
That is to say Semple arranged with a jobber on the quiet dye see
to offer thirty shillings for our onepound shares
That offer fixed the makingup price
So then when they were still without shares today and had to be carried over again they had to pay ten shillings difference on each of twentysix thousand shares plus the difference between par and the prices theyd sold at
That makes within a few hundreds of 20000 pounds in cash for one days haul
Dye see
She nodded at him expressively
Through previous talks she had really obtained an insight into the operation and it interested her more than she would have cared to confess
Well then we put that 20000 pounds in our pockets he proceeded with a steady glow in his eyes
A fortnight hence that is March 14th we ring the bell on them again and they march up to the captains office and settle a second time
Now what happens on the 14th
A jobber makes the price for Semple again and that settles the new sum they have to pay us in differences
It is for us to say what that price shall be
Well decide on that when the time comes
We most probably will just put it up another ten shillings and so take in just a simple 13000 pounds
Its best in the long run I suppose to go slow with small rises like that in order not to frighten anybody
So Semple says at any rate
But why not frighten them
Louisa asked
I thought you wanted to frighten them
You were full of that idea a while ago
He smiled genially
Ive learned some new wrinkles since then
Well frighten em stiff enough before were through with them
But at the start we just go easy
If they got word that there was a corner there would be a dead scare among the jobbers
Theyd be afraid to sell or name a price for Rubber Consols unless they had the shares in hand
And there are other ways in which that would be a nuisance
Presently of course we shall liberate some few shares so that there may be some actual dealings
Probably a certain number of the 5000 which went to the general public will come into the market too
But of course you see that all such shares will simply go through one operation before they come back to us
Some one of the fourteen men we are squeezing will snap them up and bring them straight to Semple to get free from the fortnightly tax we are levying on them
In that way we shall eventually let out say half of these fourteen shorts or perhaps more than half
What do you want to do that for
The sisters grey eyes had caught a metallic gleam as if from the talk about gold
Why let anybody out
Why cant you go on taking their money for ever
Thorpe nodded complacently
Yesthats what I asked too
It seemed to me the most natural thing when youd got em in the vise to keep them there
But when you come to reflectyou cant get more out of a man than there is in him
If you press him too hard he can always go bankruptand then hes out of your reach altogether and you lose everything that you counted on making out of him
So after a certain point each one of the fourteen men whom were squeezing must be dealt with on a different footing
We shall have to watch them all and study their resources as tipsters watch horses in the paddock
You see some of them can stand a loss of a hundred thousand pounds better than others could lose ten thousand
All that we have to know
We can take it as a principle that none of them will go bankrupt and lose his place on the exchange unless he is pressed tight to the wall
Well our business is to learn how far each fellow is from the wall to start with
Then we keep track of him one turn of the screw after another till we see hes got just enough left to buy himself out
Then well let him out
See
Its cruel isnt it
she commented calmly meditative after a little pause
Everything in the City is cruel he assured her with a light tone
All speculative business is cruel
Take our case for example
I estimate in a rough way that these fourteen men will have to pay over to us in differences and in final sales say seven hundred thousand poundsmaybe eight hundred
Well now not one of those fellows ever earned a single sovereign of that money
Theyve taken the whole of it from others and these others took it from others still and so on almost indefinitely
There isnt a sovereign of it that hasnt been through twenty hands or fifty for that matter since the last man who had done some honest work for it parted company with it
Wellmoney like that belongs to those who are in possession of it only so long as they are strong enough to hold on to it
When someone stronger still comes along he takes it away from them
They dont complain they dont cry and say its cruel
They know its the rule of the game
They accept itand begin at once looking out for a new set of fools and weaklings to recoup themselves on
Thats the way the City goes
Thorpe had concluded his philosophical remarks with ruminative slowness
As he lapsed into silence now he fell to studying his own hands on the desktop before him
He stretched out the fingers curved them in different degrees then closed them tight and turned the bulky hardlooking fists round for inspection in varying aspects
Thats the kind of hand he began again thoughtfully that breaks the Jew in the long run if theres only grit enough behind it
I used to watch those Jews hands a year ago when I was dining and wining them
Theyre all thin and wiry and full of veins
Their fingers are never still they twist round and keep stirring like a lobsters feelers
But there aint any real strength in em
They get hold of most of the things that are going because theyre eternally on the move
Its their hellish industry and activity that gives them such a pull and makes most people afraid of them
But when a hand like that takes them by the throathe held up his right hand as he spoke with the thick uncouth fingers and massive thumb arched menacingly in a powerful muscular tensionwhen THAT tightens round their neck and they feel that the grip means businessmy God
what good are they
He laughed contemptuously and slapped the relaxed palm on the desk with a noise which made his sister start
Apparently the diversion recalled something to her mind
There was a man in here asking about you today she remarked in a casual fashion
Said he was an old friend of yours
Oh yes everybodys my old friend now he observed with beaming indifference
Im already getting heaps of invitations to dinners and dances and all that
One fellow insisted on booking me for Easter for some salmon fishing hes got way down in Cumberland
I told him I couldnt come but he put my name down all the same
Says his wife will write to remind me
Damn his wife
Semple tells me that when our squeeze really begins and they realize the desperate kind of trap theyre in theyll simply shower attentions of that sort on me
He says the social pressure they can command for a game of this kind is something tremendous
But Im not to be taken in by it for a single pennyworth dye see
I dine with nobody
I fish and shoot and go yachting with nobody
Julia and Alfred and our own home in Ovington Squarethatll be good enough for me
By the wayyou havent been out to see us yet
Were all settled now
You must come at oncewhy not with me now
Louisa paid no heed to this suggestion
She had been rummaging among some loose papers on the top of the desk and she stepped round now to lift the lid and search about for something inside
He left a card for you she said as she groped among the desks contents
I dont know what I did with it
He wrote something on it
Oh damn him and his card too Thorpe protested easily
I dont want to see either of them
He said he knew you in Mexico
He said youd had dealings together
He seemed to act as if youd want to see himbut I didnt know
I didnt tell him your address
Thorpe had listened to these apathetic sentences without much interest but the sum of their message appeared suddenly to catch his attention
He sat upright and after a moments frowning brown study looked sharply up at his sister
What was his name
he asked with abruptness
I dont in the least remember she made answer holding the desktop up but temporarily suspending her search
He was a little man fiveandfifty I should think
He had long grey haira kind of Quakerlooking man
He said he saw the name over the door and he remembered your telling him your people were booksellers
He only got back here in England yesterday or the day before
He said he didnt know what youd been doing since you left Mexico
He didnt even know whether you were in England or not
Thorpe had been looking with abstracted intentness at a set of greenbound cheap British poets just at one side of his sisters head
You must find that card
he told her now with a vague severity in his voice
I know the name well enough but I want to see what hes written
Was it his address do you remember
The name itself was Tavender wasnt it
Good God
Why is it a woman never knows where shes put anything
Even Julia spends hours looking for buttonhooks or corkscrews or something of that sort every day of her life
Theyve got nothing in the world to do except know where things are right under their nose and yet thats just what they dont know at all
Oh I have a good few other things to do she reminded him as she fumbled again inside the obscurity of the desk
I can put my hand on any one of four thousand books in stock she mildly boasted over her shoulder and thats something you never learned to do
And I can tell if a single book is missingand I wouldnt trust any shopman I ever knew to do that
Oh of course youre an exception he admitted under a sense of justice
But I wish youd find the card
I know where it is she suddenly announced and forthwith closed the desk
Moving off into the remoter recesses of the crowded interior she returned to the light with the bit of pasteboard in her hand
Id stuck it in the little mirror over the washstand she explained
He almost snatched it from her and stood up the better to examine it under the gaslight
Where is Montague Street
he asked with rough directness
In Bloomsburyalongside the Museum
Thats one Montague StreetI dont know how many others there may be
Thorpe had already taken up his umbrella and was buttoning his coat
YesBloomsbury he said hurriedly
That would be his form
And you say he knew nothing about my movements or whereaboutsnothing about the Company eh
He looked at his watch as he spoke
Evidently the presence of this stranger had excited him a good deal
No she assured him reflectively no Im sure he didnt
From what he said he doesnt know his way about London very well or anywhere else for that matter I should say
Thorpe nodded and put his finger to his forehead with a meaning look
Nohes a shade off in the upper story he told her in a confidential tone
Still its important that I should see himand with only a hasty handshake he bustled out of the shop
By the light of the street lamp opposite she could see him on the pavement in the pelting rain vehemently signalling with his umbrella for a cab
CHAPTER XV Weve got a spare room here havent we
Thorpe asked his niece when she came out to greet him in the hall of their new home in Ovington Square
He spoke with palpable eagerness before even unbuttoning his damp greatcoat or putting off his hat
I mean its all in working order ready for use
Why yes uncle Julia answered after a moments thought
Is someone coming
I think so he replied with a grunt of relief
He seemed increasingly pleased with the project he had in mind as she helped him off with his things
The smile he gave her when she playfully took his arm to lead him into the adjoining library was clearly but a part of the satisfied grin with which he was considering some development in his own affairs
He got into his slippers and into the easychair before the bright fire and lit a cigar with a contented air
Well my little girl
he said with genial inconsequence and smiled again at her where she stood beside the mantel
It will be such a lark to play the hostess to a stranger
she exclaimed
When is he comingI suppose it is a he she added less buoyantly
Ohthat fellow Thorpe said as if he had been thinking of something else
WellI cant tell just when he will turn up
I only learned he was in townor in Englanda couple of hours ago
I havent seen him yet at all
I drove round to his lodgings near the British Museum but he wasnt there
He only comes there to sleep but they told me he turned in earlyby nine oclock or so
Then I went round to a hotel and wrote a note for him and took it back to his lodgings and left it for him
I told him to pack up his things as soon as he got it and drive here and make this his homefor the time being at least
Then its some old friend of yours
said the girl
I know I shall like him
Thorpe laughed somewhat uneasily
Wellyeshes a kind of a friend of mine he said with a note of hesitation in his voice
I dont know though that youll think much of him
He aint what youd call a ladies man
He laughed again at some thought the words conjured up
Hes a curious simple old party whod just like a comfortable corner somewhere by himself and wouldnt expect to be talked to or entertained at all
If he does come hell keep to himself pretty well
He wouldnt be any company for you
I meanfor you or Alfred either
I think hes a Canadian or West IndianBritish subject at all eventsbut hes lived all his life in the West and he wouldnt know what to do in a drawingroom or that sort of thing
Youd better just not pay any attention to him
Pass the time of day of course but thats all
Julias alert smallfeatured face expressed some vague disappointment at what she heard but her words were cheerful enough
Oh of coursewhatever he likes best she said
I will tell Potter to make everything ready
I suppose theres no chance of his being here in time for dinner
Thorpe shook his head and then lifted his brows over some new perplexity
I guess hed want to eat his meals out anyway he said after some thought
I dont seem to remember much about him in that respect of course everything was so different in camp out in Mexicobut I daresay he wouldnt be much of an ornament at the table
However thatll be all right
Hes as easy to manage as a rabbit
If I told him to eat on the roof hed do it without a murmur
You see its this way Julia hes a scientific mana kind of geologist and mining expert and rubber expertand chemical expert and all sort of things
I suppose he must have gone through collegevery likely hell turn out to have better manners than I was giving him credit for
Ive only seen him in the rough so to speak
We werent at all intimate thenbut we had dealings together and there are certain important reasons why I should keep close in touch with him while hes here in London
But Ill try and do that without letting you be bothered
What an idea
cried Julia
As if that wasnt what we had the house forto see the people you want to see
Her uncle smiled rather ruefully and looked in a rather dubious way at his cigar
Between you and me and the lamppost Jule he said with a slow whimsical drawl there isnt a fellow in the world that I wanted to see less than I did him
But since hes herewhy weve got to make the best of it
After dinner Thorpe suffered the youngsters to go up to the drawingroom in the tacit understanding that he should probably not see them again that night
He betook himself then once more to the library as it was calledthe little cozy darkpanelled room off the hall where the owner of the house had left two locked bookcases and where Thorpe himself had installed a writingdesk and a diminutive safe for his papers
The chief purpose of the small apartment however was indicated by the two big round lowseated easychairs before the hearth and by the cigar boxes and spiritstand and tumblers visible behind the glass of the cabinet against the wall
Thorpe himself called the room his snuggery and spent many hours there in slippered comfort smoking and gazing contentedly into the fire
Sometimes Julia read to him as he sat thus at his ease but then he almost invariably went to sleep
Now when he had poured out some whiskey and water and lit a cigar the lounging chairs somehow did not attract him
He moved about aimlessly in the circumscribed space his hands in his pockets his burly shoulders rounded his face dulled and heavy as with a depression of doubt
The sound of the piano upstairs came intermittently to his ears
Often he ascended to the drawingroom to hear Julia playand more often still with all the doors open he enjoyed the mellowed murmur of her music here at his ease in the big chair
But tonight he had no joy in the noise
more than once as he slouched restlessly round the room the notion of asking her to stop suggested itself but he forbore to put it into action
Once he busied himself for a time in kneeling before his safe and scrutinizing in detail the papers in one of the bundles it contained
At lastit was after ten oclock and the music above had ceasedthe welcome sounds of cabwheels without and then of the doorbell came to dispel his fidgeting suspense
On the instant he straightened himself and his face rearranged its expression
He fastened upon the door of the room the controlled calm glance of one who is easily confident about what is to happen
Quakerlooking was not an inapt phrase for the person whom the maid ushered into the room through this door
He was a small thin elderly man bowed of figure and shuffling in gait
His coat and large lowcrowned hat though worn almost to shabbiness conveyed an indefinable sense of some theological standard or pretence to such a standard
His meagre face too with its infinity of anxious yet meaningless lines and its dim spectacled eyes so plainly overtaxed by the effort to discern anything clearly might have belonged to any old village priest grown childish and bleareyed in the solitude of stupid books
Even the blotches of telltale colour on his long nose were not altogether unclerical in their suggestion
A poor old man he seemed as he stood blinking in the electric light of the strange warm apartmenta helpless worn old creature inured through long years to bleak adverse winds hoping now for nothing better in this world than present shelter
How do you do Mr Thorpe he said after a moment with nervous formality
This is unexpectedly kind of you sir
Whynot at all
said Thorpe shaking him cordially by the hand
What have we got houses for but to put up our old friends
And how are you anyway
Youve brought your belongings have you
Thats right
He glanced into the hall to make sure that they were being taken upstairs and then closed the door
I suppose youve dined
Take off your hat and coat
Make yourself at home
Thats ittake the big chair thereso
And now lets have a look at you
Well Tavender my man you havent grown any younger
But I suppose none of us do
And whatll you have to drink
I take plain water in mine but theres soda if you prefer it
And which shall it beIrish or Scotch
Mr Tavenders countenance revealed the extremity of his surprise and confusion at the warmth of this welcome
It apparently awed him as well for though he shrank into a corner of the huge chair he painstakingly abstained from resting his head against its back
Uncovered this head gained a certain dignity of effect from the fashion in which the thin irongrey hair parted in the middle fell away from the full intellectual temples and curled in meek locks upon his collar
A vague resemblance to the type of Wesleyor was it Froebelmight have hinted itself to the observers mind
Thorpes thoughts however were not upon types
Wellhe said from the opposite chair in his roundest heartiest voice when the other had with diffidence suffered himself to be served and had deferentially lighted on one side the big cigar pressed upon himWelland hows the world been using you
Not very handsomely Mr Thorpe the other responded in a hushed constrained tone
Oh chuck the Misters
Thorpe bade him
Arent we old pals man
Youre plain Tavender and Im plain Thorpe
Youre very kind murmured Tavender still abashed
For some minutes he continued to reply dolefully and with a kind of shamefaced reluctance to the questions piled upon him
He was in evil luck nothing had gone well with him it had been with the greatest difficulty that he had scraped together enough to get back to London on the chance of obtaining some expert commission practically he possessed nothing in the world beyond the clothes on his back and the contents of two old carpetbagsthese admissions by degrees were wormed from him
But have you parted with the concession then that you bought from me
Thorpe suddenly asked him
Help yourself to some more whiskey
Tavender sighed as he tipped the decanter
It isnt any good he answered sadly
The Government repudiates itthat is the Central Government at Mexico
Of course I never blamed you
I bought it with my eyes open and you sold it in perfect good faith
I never doubted that at all
But its not worth the paper its written onthats certain
Its that that busted methat and some other things
Wellwell
said Thorpe blankly
His astonishment was obviously genuine and for a little it kept him silent while he pondered the novel aspects of the situation thus disclosed
Then his eyes brightened as a new path outlined itself
I suppose youve got the papersthe concession and my transfer to you and all that
he asked casually
Oh yes replied Tavender
He added with a gleam of returning selfcommandThats all I have got
Lets seewhat was it you paid meThree thousand eight hundred pounds wasnt it
Tavender made a calculation in mental arithmetic
Yes something like that
Just under nineteen thousand dollars he said
Well remarked Thorpe with slow emphasis I wont allow you to suffer that way by me
Ill buy it back from you at the same price you paid for it
Tavender beginning to tremble jerked himself upright in his chair and stared through his spectacles at his astounding host
You sayhe gaspedyou say youll buy it back
Certainly said Thorpe
Thats what I said
II never heard of such a thing
the other faltered with increasing agitation
Noyou cant mean it
It isnt common sense
Its common decency replied the big man in his most commanding manner
Its life and death to youand it doesnt matter a fleabite to me
So since you came to grief through me why shouldnt I do the fair thing and put you back on your legs again
Tavender staring now at those shrunken legs of his breathed heavily
The thing overwhelmed him
Once or twice he lifted his head and essayed to speak but no speech came to his thin lips
He moistened them eventually with a long deliberate pull at his glass
This much ought to be understood however Thorpe resumed reflecting upon his words as he went along
If Im to buy back a dead horse like that its only reasonable that there should be conditions
I suppose youve seen by this time that even if this concession of ours was recognized by the Government there wouldnt be any money in it to speak of
I didnt realize that two years ago any more than you did but its plain enough now
The trade has proved it
A property of rubber trees has no real valueso long as theres a wilderness of rubber trees all round thats everybodys property
How can a man pay even the interest on his purchase money supposing hes bought a rubber plantation when he has to compete with people whove paid no purchase money at all but just get out as much as they like from the free forest
You must know that that is so
Tavender nodded eloquently
Oh yes I know that is so
You can prove it by me
Thorpe grinned a little
As it happens that aint what I need to have you prove he said dryly
Now WE know that a rubber property is no goodbut London doesnt know it
Everybody here thinks that its a great business to own rubber trees
Why man alive do you knowthe audacity of the example it had occurred to him to cite brought a gratified twinkle to his eyes as he went ondo you know that a man here last year actually sold a rubber plantation for four hundred thousand poundstwo millions of dollars
Not in cash of course but in shares that he could do something withand before hes done with it Im told hes going to make twice that amount of money out of it
Thatll show you what London is like
YesI suppose they do those things remarked Tavender vaguely
Wellmy point is that perhaps I can do something or other with this concession of yours here
I may even be able to get my money back on it
At any rate Ill take my chances on itso that at least you shant lose anything by it
Of course if youd rather try and put it on the market yourself why go ahead
There was a wistful pathos in the way Tavender shook his head
Big money doesnt mean anything to me any more he said wearily
Im too old and Im too tired
Whyfourfiveyes half a dozen times Ive had enough money to last me comfortably all my lifeand every time Ive used it as bait to catch bigger money with and lost it all
I dont do that any more
Ive got something the matter with me internally that takes the nerve all out of me
The doctors dont agree about it but whatever its name is Ive got it for keeps
Probably I shant live very longThorpe recalled that the old man had always taken a gloomy view of his health after the third glassand if you want to pay me the nineteen thousand dollars or whatever it is why I shall say God bless you and be more than contented
Oh theres something more to it than that observed Thorpe with an added element of businesslike briskness in his tone
If I let you out in this waysomething of course you could never have dreamed would happenyou must do some things for me
I should want you for example to go back to Mexico at once
Of course Id pay your expenses out
Or say Id give you a round four thousand pounds to cover that and some other things too
You wouldnt object to that would you
The man who two hours before had confronted existence with the change of his last fivepound note in his pocket did not hesitate now
Oh no that would be all right with reviving animation he declared
He helped himself again from the cutglass decanter
What would you want me to do there
Oh a report on the concession for a starter Thorpe answered with careful indifference
I suppose they still know your name as an authority
I could make that all right anyway
But one thing I ought to speak ofit might be rather importantI wouldnt like to have you mention to anybody that the concession has at any time been yours
That might tend to weaken the value of your report dont you see
Let it be supposed that the concession has been my property from the start
You catch my point dont you
There never was any such thing as a transfer of it to you
Its always been mine
Tavender gave his benefactor a purblind sort of wink
Always belonged to you
Why of course it did he said cheerfully
The other breathed a cautious prolonged sigh of relief Youd better light a fresh one hadnt you
he asked observing with a kind of contemptuous tolerance the old mans efforts to ignite a cigar which had more than once unrolled like a carpenters shaving in his unaccustomed fingers and was now shapelessly defiant of both draught and suction
Tavender laughed to himself silently as he took a new cigar and puffed at the match held by his companion
The air of innocence and longsuffering meekness was falling rapidly away from him
He put his shabby boots out confidently to the fender and made gestures with his glass as he talked
My mistake he declared in insistent tones was in not turning down science thirty years ago and going in bodily for business
Then I should have made my pile as you seem to have done
But I tried to do something of both
Half the year I was assaying crushings or running a level or analyzing sugars for a salary and the other half I was trying to do a gamble with that salary on the strength of what Id learned
You cant ring the bell that way
Youve got to be either a pig or a pup
You cant do both
Now for instance if Id come to London when you did and brought my money with me instead of buying your concession with it Why what good do you suppose you would have done
Thorpe interrupted him with goodnatured brusqueness
Youd have had it taken from you in a fortnight
Why man do you know what London is
Youd have had no more chance here than a naked nigger in a swampfull of alligators
You seem to have hit it off the other objected
This is as fine a house as I was ever in
With me its different Thorpe replied carelessly
I have the talent for moneymaking
Im a man in armour
The gators cant bite me nor yet the rattlesnakes
Yesmen are made up differently Tavender assented with philosophical gravity
Then he lurched gently in the overlarge chair and fixed an intent gaze upon his host
What did you make your money in
he demanded not with entire distinctness of enunciation
It wasnt rubber was it
Thorpe shook his head
Theres no money in rubber
Im entirely in financeon the Stock Exchangedealing in differences he replied with a serious face
The explanation seemed wholly acceptable to Tavender
He mused upon it placidly for a time with his reverend head pillowed askew against the corner of the chair
Then he let his cigar drop and closed his eyes
The master of the house bent forward and noiselessly helped himself to another glass of whiskey and water
Then sinking back again he eyed his odd guest meditatively as he sipped the drink
He said to himself that in all the miraculous run of luck which the year had brought him this was the most extraordinary manifestation of the lot
It had been so easy to ignore the existence of this tiresome and fatuous old man so long as he was in remote Mexico that he had practically forgotten him
But he should not soon forget the frightened shock with which he had learned of his presence in London that afternoon
For a minute or two there in his sisters bookshop it had seemed as if he were falling through the airas if the substantial earth had crumbled away from under him
But then his nerve had returned to him his resourceful brain had reasserted itself
With ready shrewdness he had gone out and met the emergency and made it the servant of his own purposes
He could be glad now unreservedly glad that Tavender had come to London that things had turned out as they had
In truth he stood now for the first time on solid ground
When he thought of it now the risk he had been running all these months gave him a little sinking of the heart
Upon reflection the performance of having sold the same property first to Tavender in Mexico and then to the Rubber Consols Company in London might be subject to injurious comment or worse
The fact that it was not a real property to begin with had no place in his thoughts
It was a concessionand concessions were immemorially worth what they would fetch
But the other thing might have been so awkwardand now it was all right
For an hour and more till the fire burnt itself out and the guests snoring became too active a nuisance Thorpe sat lost in this congratulatory reverie
Then he rose and sharply shaking Tavender into a semblance of consciousness led him upstairs and put him to bed
Three days later he personally saw Tavender off at Waterloo station by the steamertrain en route for Southampton and New York
The old man was in childlike good spirits looking more ecclesiastical than ever in the new clothes he had been enabled to buy
He visibly purred with content whenever his dim eyes caught sight of the new valise and steamer trunk which belonged to him on the busy platform
Youve been very kind to me Thorpe he said more than once as they stood together beside the open door of the compartment
I was never so hospitably treated before in my life
Your attention to me has been wonderful
I call you a true friend
Oh thats all right
Glad to do it replied the other lightly
In truth he had not let Tavender stray once out of his sight during those three days
He had dragged him tirelessly about London showing him the sights from South Kensington Museum to the Tower shopping with him resting in old taverns with him breakfasting lunching aud dining with himin the indefatigable resolution that he should strike up no dangerous gossiping acquaintance with strangers
The task had been tiresome in the extreme but it had been very well worth while
One thing Im rather sorry about Tavender remarked in apologetic parenthesisI ought to have gone down and seen that brotherinlaw of mine in Kent
Hes been very good to me and Im not treating him very well
I wrote to tell him I was comingbut since then I havent had a minute to myself
However I can write to him and explain how it happened
And probably Ill be over again sometime
Why of course said Thorpe absently
The allusion to the brotherinlaw in Kent had escaped his notice so intent was he upon a new congeries of projects taking vague shape in his mind
Think of yourself as my man out there he said now slowly following the clue of his thoughts
There may be big things to do
Write to me as often as you can
Tell me everything thats going on
Money will be no object to meyou can have as much as you likeif things turn up out there that are worth taking up
But mind you say nothing about meor any connection youve ever had with me
Youll get a letter from the Secretary of a Company and the Chairman asking for a report on a certain property and naming a fee
You simply make a good reporton its merits
You say nothing about anything elseabout me or the history of the concession or its validity or anything
I mustnt be alluded to in any way
You quite understand that
Trust me
said the old man and wrung his benefactors hand
It was indeed with a trustful eye that Thorpe watched the train draw out of the station
CHAPTER XVI THE week following the August Bank Holiday is very rarely indeed a busy or anxious time in the City
In the ordinary course of things it serves as the easygoing preludewith but casual and inattentive visits eastward and with only the most careless glances through the financial papersto the halcyon period of the real vacation
Men come to the City during this week it is true but their thoughts are elsewhereon the moors on the blue sea on the glacier or the fiord or the pleasant German pine forests
To the great mass of City people this August in question began in a normal enough fashion
To one little group of operators however and to the widening circle of brokers bankers and other men of affairs whose interests were more or less involved with those of this group it was a season of keen perturbation
A combat of an extraordinary character was going ona combat which threatened to develop into a massacre
Even to the operators who unhappily for themselves were principals in this fight it was a struggle in the dark
They knew little about it beyond the grimlypatent fact that they were battling for their very lives
The outer ring of their friends and supporters and dependents knew still less though their rage and fears were perhaps greater
The press seemed to know nothing at all
This unnatural silence of the Citys mouthpieces usually so resoundingly clamorous upon the one side and the other when a duel is in progress gave a sinister aspect to the thing
The papers had been gagged and blindfolded for the occasion
This in itself was of baleful significance
It was not a duel which they had been bribed to ignore
It was an assassination
Outwardly there was nothing to see save the unofficial bald statement that on August 1st the latest of twelve fortnightly settlements in this stock Rubber Consols had been bid for and carried over at 15 pounds for onepound shares
The information concerned the public at large not at all
Nobody knew of any friend or neighbour who was fortunate enough to possess some of these shares
Readers here and there noting the figures must have said to themselves that certain lucky people were coining money but very little happened to be printed as to the identity of these people
Stray notes were beginning to appear in the personal columns of the afternoon papers about a Rubber King of the name of Thorpe but the modern exploitation of the worlds four corners makes so many kings that the name had not as yet familiarized itself to the popular eye
City men who hear more than they read knew in a general way about this Rubber King
He was an outsider who had come in and was obviously filling his pockets but it was a comforting rule that outsiders who did this always got their pockets emptied for them again in the long run
There seemed nothing about Thorpe to suggest that he would prove an exception to the rule
He was investing his winnings with great freedom so the City understood and his office was besieged daily by promoters and touts
They could clean out his strongbox faster than the profits of his Rubber corner could fill it
To know such a man however could not but be useful and they made furtive notes of his number in Austin Friars on their cuffs after conversation had drifted from him to other topics
As to the Rubber corner itself the Stock Exchange as a whole was apathetic
When some of the sufferers ventured cautious hints about the possibility of official intervention on their behalf they were laughed at by those who did not turn away in cold silence
Of the fourteen men who had originally been caught in the net drawn tight by Thorpe and Semple all the conspicuous ones belonged to the class of wreckers a class which does not endear itself to Capel Court
Both Rostocker and Aronson who it was said were worst hit were men of great wealth but they had systematically amassed these fortunes by strangling in their cradles weak enterprises and by undermining and toppling over other enterprises which would not have been weak if they had been given a legitimate chance to live
Their system was legal enough in the eyes alike of the law and of the Stock Exchange rules
They had an undoubted right to mark out their prey and pursue it and bring it down and feed to the bone upon it
But the exercise of this right did not make them beloved by the begetters and sponsors of their victims
When word first went round on the last day of February that a lamb had unexpectedly turned upon these two practised and confident wolves and had torn an ear from each of them and driven them pellmell into a corner it was received on all sides with a gratified smile
Later by fortnightly stages the story grew at once more tragic and more satisfactory
Not only Rostocker and Aronson but a dozen others were in the cul de sac guarded by this surprising and bloodyminded lamb
Most of the names were wellknown as those of wreckers
In this category belonged Blaustein Ganz Rothfoere Lewis Ascher and Mendel and if Harding Carpenter and Vesey could not be so confidently classified at least their misfortune excited no particular sympathy
Two other names mentioned those of Norfell and Pinney were practically unknown
There was some surprise however at the statement that the old and respected and extremely conservative firm of Fromentin Bros was entangled in the thing
Egyptian bonds minor Levantine loans discounts in the Arabian and Persian tradesthese had been specialties of the Fromentins for many years
Who could have expected to find them caught among the shorts in Mexican rubber
It was Mexico wasnt it that these Rubber Consols purported to be connected with
Thorpes Company upon its commercial merits had not been considered at all by the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange at the time of its flotation
Men vaguely and with difficulty recalled the fact of its prospectus when the corner in its shares was first talked about
They looked it up in their lists and files later on but its terms said nothing to them
Nobody discussed the value of the assets owned by this Company or the probability of its paying a dividendeven when the price bid for its shares was making the most sensational upward leaps
How Thorpe stood with his shareholders or whether he had any genuine shareholders behind him at all was seen by the keen eyes of Capel Court to be beside the question
Very likely it was a queer affair if the truth were knownbut at least it had substance enough in it to be giving the wreckers a lively time
By the end of July it was understood that the fight was better worth watching than anything that had been seen in a long time
The only trouble was that there was so little to see
The papers said nothing
The sufferers were the reverse of garrulous
The little red Scotchman Semple who was the visible avenging sword of the corner was more imperturbably silent than anybody else
His fellowmembers in the House watched him now however with a new respect
They discovered unsuspected elements of power in his thin tight mouth in the direct cold glances of his browngrey eyes in the very way he carried his head and wore his hat
He came to be pointed out and nodded about behind his back more than anyone else in the House and important men sought his acquaintance with an awkward show of civility who were notorious for their rude exclusiveness
It might be of course that his corner would break under him at any fortnightly settlement but already he had carried it much further than such things often went and the planning of the coup had been beyond doubt Napoleonic
Had this small sandy Scot planned it or was he merely the weapon in Thorpes hand
Both views had their supporters on the Exchange but after the wrench of August 1st when with an abrupt eightyshilling rise the price of Rubber Consols stood at 15 pounds and it was to be computed that Semple had received on that single day nearly 75000 pounds in differences and backwardation a story was set afloat which gave Thorpe the undivided credit of the invention
It was related as coming from his own lips that he had schemed it all out to be revenged upon a group of Jewish operators against whom he had a grievance
In confirmation of this tale it was pointed out that of the seven men still held pinned in the fatal corner six were Jewsand this did upon first glance look significant
But then it was objected upon reflection that Blaustein and Ascher had both been permitted to make their escape and this hardly justified the theory of an implacable antiSemitic vendetta
The objection seemed reasonable but it was met in turn by the point that Blaustein and Ascher had been bled white as Bismarcks phrase went before they were released whereas the five Christians had been liberated with relatively moderate fines
Upon the whole a certain odour of the Judenhetze clung thereafter about the corner in Rubber Consols
On an afternoon of the following week Mr Stormont Thorpe was alone in the Board Room of the offices in Austin Friars
He had risen from the great rollertopped desk over between the windows and walked now with a lethargic tired step to and fro before the empty fireplace yawning more than once and stretching out his arms in the supreme gesture of fatigue
After a dozen listless rounds something occurred to him
He moved with a certain directness of purpose to the cabinet in the corner unlocked it and poured out for himself a tumbler of brandy and soda
He drank it without a pause then turned again and began pacing up and down as before his hands clasped behind him his head bent in thought
The intervening six months had effected visible changes in the outer man
One noted most readily that the face had grown fuller in its lower parts and was far less browned than formerly
The large heavy countenance with its square jaws masked now under increased flesh its beginnings of a doublechin and its slightly flabby effect of pallor was no longer lacking in individual distinction
It was palpably the visage of a dictator
The moustache had been cut down to military brevity and the line of mouth below it was eloquent of rough power
The steady grey eyes seemingly smaller yet more conspicuous than before revealed in their glance new elements of secretiveness of strategy supported by abundant and confident personal force
The man himself seemed scarcely to have grown stouter
He held himself more compactly as it were seemed more the master of all his physical expressions
He was dressed like a magnate who was also a person of taste
There was a flower in the lapel of his wellshaped frockcoat and the rustle of his starched and spotless white waistcoat murmured pleasantly of refined toilets
The Marquis of Chaldonand a gentleman with him
The announcement from a clerk who had noiselessly opened the door imposed itself with decorum upon Thorpes reverie
Who is the gentleman with him
Thorpe began austerely to ask after an instants hesitation
But this briefest of delays had brought the callers into plain view behind the clerk and with a slight gesture the master assented to their entrance
This large apartment was no longer called the Board Room by anybody
By tacit processes it had become Mr Thorpes room
Not even the titular Chairman of the Company the renowned and eminent Lord Chaldon exAmbassador and exViceroy entered this chamber now with any assumption of proprietorship in it
No hint of a recollection that there were such things as the Company and the Board or that he was nominally the head of both expressed itself in his Lordships demeanour as he advanced his hand a little extended
The noble Chairman was white of beard and hair and extremely courteous of mannera small carefullyclad gracious old gentleman whose mild pink countenance had with years of anxiety about ways and means disposed itself in lines which produced a chronic expression of solicitude
A nervous affection of the eyelids lent to this look at intervals a beseeching quality which embarrassed the beholder
All men had liked him and spoken well of him throughout his long and hardworked career
Thorpe was very fond of him indeed and put a respectful cordiality into his grasp of the proffered hand
Then he looked with a certain thinlyveiled bluntness of enquiry past the Marquis to his companion
You were very kind to give me the appointment said Lord Chaldon with a little purring gloss of affability upon the earnestness of his tone
I wish very much to introduce to you my friend my old friend I may say Monsieur Alexandre Fromentin
We slept together under the same tent in the Persian country beyond Bagdadoh it must have been quite forty years ago
We were youngsters looking to win our first spurs thenI in my line he in his
And often since we have renewed that old friendshipat many different placesIndia and Constantinople and Egypt
I wish heartily to commend him to youryour kindness
Thorpe had perfunctorily shaken hands with the strangera tall slender sharpfaced cleanshaven narrowshouldered man who by these accounts of his years ought not to have such excessively black hair
He bowed in a foreign fashion and uttered some words which Thorpe though he recognized them as English in intent failed to follow
The voice was that of an elderly man and at a second glance there were plenty of proofs that he might have been older than the Marquis out there in Persia forty years ago
But Thorpe did not like old men who dyed their hair and he offered his visitors chairs drawn up from the table toward his desk with a certain reserve of manner
Seating himself in the revolving chair at the desk itself he put the tips of his fingers together and looked this gentleman with the Continental name and experience in the face
Is there something you wish me to do
he asked passively facilitating the opening of conversation
Ah my God
Something
repeated the other with a fluttering gesture of his hands over his thin pointed kneeseverything Mr
Thorpe
Thats a tolerably large order isnt it
Thorpe asked calmly moving a slow inscrutable glance from one to the other of his callers
I could ask for nothing that would be a greater personal favourand kindnessLord Chaldon interposed
His tone bore the stress of sincerity
That means a great deal to me as you know my Lord replied Thorpe but I dont in the least understand what is it that your friend wants
Only that I shall not be buried in a bankrupts grave the suppliant answered with a kind of embittered eagerness of utterance
That I shall not see disgraced the honoured name that my father and his father bequeathed to my care
Thorpes large composed countenance betrayed a certain perplexity
There must be a mistake he observed
I dont even know this name of yours
I never heard it before
The others mobile face twisted itself in a grimace of incredulity
He had a conspicuously wide mouth and its trick of sidelong extension at this moment was very unpleasant
Ah Herr Je
He never heard it he ejaculated turning nervously to the Marquis
Would to the good God you never had
he told Thorpe with suppressed excitement
Lord Chaldon his own voice shaken a little interposed with an explanation
My friend is the headthe respected headof the firm of Fromentin Brothers
I think you havehave dealings with them
Thorpe after a furtive instant of bewilderment opened his mouth
Oh
I see he said
I know what you mean now
With the French pronunciation I didnt recognize the name
Ive always heard it called Fromentin here in London
Oh yes of courseFromentin Brothers
His lips shut tight again at this
The listeners had caught no helpful clue from the tone of his words
They exchanged a glance and then M Fromentin spoke
Mr Thorpe he began slowly with an obvious effort at selfrepression
It is a very simple story
Our house is an old one
My fathers grandfather organized the finance of the commissariat of General Bonaparte in Egypt
He created the small beginnings of the carpet and rug importation from Asia Minor
His son and in turn his son followed him
They became bankers as well as importers
They helped very greatly to develop the trade of the Levant
They were not avaricious men or usurers
It is not in our blood
Your Chairman Lord Chaldon who honours me so highly by calling me his friendhe will assure you that we have a good name in the East
Our banks have befriended the people and never oppressed or injured them
For that reasonI will say perhaps for that reasonwe have never become a very rich house
It is possible to name bankers who have made large fortunes out of Egypt
It was different with us
Lord Chaldon will tell you that of our own free willmy two brothers and Iof our own choice we consented to lose a fifth of all our possessions rather than coin into gold by force the tears and blood of the wretched fellaheen
YesI have never known a more honourable or humane action put in the Marquis fervently
And then my brothers diePolydor who lived mostly at Smyrna and whose estate was withdrawn from the business by his widow and Augustin who lived here in London after 1870 and diedit is now six years ago
He left a son Robert who is my nephew and my partner
He is now of an ageperhaps thirty years
He was a small child when he came to Londonhe has become more English than the English themselves
His activity and industry are very great he forms plans of such magnitude and numbers that they would compel his grandfather to turn in his coffin
I am in indifferent health
I live much at Homburg and Marienbad and at Cairo
Practically speaking I have retired from business
There remain branches of our housein several placesbut the London house has become the centre of all thingsand Robert has become the London house
This I make plain to your mind do I Mr
Thorpe
The other with his chin sunk within the collar of his white waistcoat and scrutinizing the narrator with a steadfast though impassive glance made the faintest possible nod of assent
I had great confidence in Robert the old man went on
His eyes were dimming with tears and his voice quavered uncertainly
His plans seemed wise even if they risked more than formerly
The conditions of business are wholly altered since my youthand it was best I thought to make Robert free to act under these conditions which he understood much better than I could pretend to do
Thus it was that when he said it was necessary for Fromentin Brothers to belong to the Stock Exchange I did not object
He was active and bold and clever and he was in the thick of the fight
Therefore he should be the judge in all things
And that is our ruin
In the time of the South African excitement he won a great deal of money
Then he lost it all and more
Then gambling began and his fortunes went now up now down but always as his books show to me nowsinking a little on the average
He grew more adventurousmore careless
He put many small counters upon different numbers on the table
You know what I mean
And in an accursed moment because other gamblers were doing the same he sold two thousand of your shares without having them in his hands
Voila
He wishes now to put a bullet through his brain
He proposes that as the fitting end of Fromentin Freres
Thorpe his chin on his breast continued to regard the melancholy figure opposite with a moody eye
It seemed a long minute before he broke the tense silence by a sigh of discomfort
I do not discuss these things with anybody he said then coldly
If I had known who you were I dont think youd have got in
The Marquis of Chaldon intuitively straightened himself in his chair and turned toward the speaker a glance of distressed surprise
Or noI beg your pardon Thorpe hastened to add upon the instant hint of this lookthat doesnt convey my meaning
Of course our Chairman brings whom he pleases
His friendsas a matter of courseare our friends
What I should have said was that if this had been mentioned beforehand to me I should have explained that it wasnt possible to discuss that particular business
Butpardon mesaid Lord Chaldon in a quiet very gentle yet insistent voice which seemed now to recall to its listeners the fact that sovereigns and chancellors had in their day had attentive ears for its tonespardon me but why should it not be possible
Thorpe frowned doubtfully and shifted his position in his chair
What could I say if it were discussed
he made vague retort
Im merely one of the Directors
You are our Chairman but you see he hasnt found it of any use to discuss it with you
There are hard and fast rules about these things
They run their natural course
You are not a business man my Lord Oh I think I may be called a business man interposed the nobleman suavely
They would tell you so in Calcutta I think and in Cairo too
When one considers it I have transacted a great deal of businesson the behalf of other people
And if you will permit meI do not impute indirection of coursebut your remark seems to require a footnote
It is true that I am Chairman of the Board on which you are a Directorbut it is not quite the whole truth
I as Chairman know absolutely nothing about this matter
As I understand the situation it is not in your capacity as a Director that you know anything about it either
Yet He paused as if suddenly conscious of some impropriety in this domestic frankness before a third party and Thorpe pounced through his wellmannered hesitation with the swiftness of a bird of prey
Let me suggest he said roundly lifting his head and poising a hand to hold attention while he thought upon what it was he should suggestthis is what I would say
It seems rather irregular doesnt it
to debate the matter in the presence of an outsider
You see it yourself
That is partly what I meant
Now I have met Mr Fromentin he gave the name its English vowels with an obstinate emphasis and I have heard his statement
You have heard it too
If he wishes to lay more facts before us why well and good
But then I would suggest that he leave the matter in our hands to discuss and look into between ourselves
That seems to you the proper course doesnt it Lord Chaldon
The French banker had been studying with strained acuteness the big lymphatic mask of the Director with sundry sharp glances aside at the Chairman
The nervous changes on his alert meagre old face showed how intently he followed every phase of their talk
A certain sardonic perception of evil in the air curled on his lip when he saw the Marquis accede with a bow and wave of the hand to Thorpes proposition
Then he made his bow in turn and put the best face possible upon the matter
Naturally I consult your convenienceand the proprieties he said with an effect of proud humility
There are but a few other facts to submit
My nephew has already paid in differences upon those accursed two thousand shares a sum of nearly 30000 pounds
I have the figures in my pocketbut they are fixed in my head as well
Twentyeight thousand five hundred those differences already amount to not to speak of interest
At the last settlement August 1st the price per share was 15 pounds
That would make 30000 pounds more if we bought nowor a total of practically 60000 pounds
Eh bien
I beg for the privilege of being allowed to buy these shares now
It is an unpleasant confession to make but the firm of Fromentin Freres will be made very poor by this loss of 60000 pounds
It was not always so but it is so now
My nephew Robert has brought it into that condition
You see my shame at this admission
With all my own means and with his sisters marriage portion we can make up this sum of 30000 pounds and still enable the firm to remain in existence
I have gone over the books very painstakingly since I arrived in London
It can be kept afloat and it can be brought back to safe and moderately profitable coursesif nothing worse happens
With another six weeks like the last this will not be at all possible
We shall have the cup of dishonour thrust between our teeth
That will be the end of everything
M Fromentin finished in tremulous grave tones
After looking with blurred eyes for a moment into Thorpes face he bowed his head and softly swayed the knees upon which his thin dark hands maintained their clutch
Not even the revelation of hair quite white at the roots unduly widening the track of parting on the top of his dyed head could rob this movement of its mournful dignity
Thorpe after a moments pause took a pencil and paper from the desk and made a calculation
He bit his lips and frowned at the sight of these figures and set down some others which seemed to please him no more
Then with a sudden gesture as of impatience he rose to his feet
How much is that sisters marriage portion you spoke of
he asked rather brusquely
The French gentleman had also risen
He looked with an air of astonishment at his questioner and then hardened his face
I apologize for mentioning it he said with brevity
One does not speak of family affairs
I asked you how much it was pursued Thorpe in a masterful tone
A man doesnt want to rob a girl of her marriage portion
I think I must not answer you the other replied hesitatingly
It was the fault of my emotion to introduce the subject
Pray leave the young lady out of account
Then Ive nothing more to say Thorpe declared and seated himself again with superfluous energy
He scowled for a little at the disorder of his desk and then flung forth an angry explanation
If you evade fair questions like that how can you expect that I will go out of my way to help you
Oh permit me Mr Thorpethe Marquis intervened soothinglyI think you misapprehend
My friend I am sure wished to evade nothing
He had the idea that he was at fault inin alluding to a purely domestic matter asas awhat shall I sayas a plea for your consideration
He turned to the old banker
You will not refuse to mention the sum to me will you my friend
M Fromentin shrugged his shoulders
It is ten thousand pounds he replied almost curtly
Thorpe was seemingly mollified
Very well then he said
I will sell you 2000 shares at ten pounds
The others exchanged a wondering look
Monsieur the banker stammeredI see your meaning
You will forgive meit is very well meant indeed by youbut it was not my proposition
The marketprice is fifteen poundsand we were prepared to pay it
Thorpe laughed in a peremptory gusty way
But you cant pay more than I ask
he told him with rough geniality
Come if I let you and your nephew in out of the cold what kind of menfolk would you be to insist that your niece should be left outside
As I said I dont want her money
I dont want any womans money
If Im going to be nice to the rest of the family whats the objection to my being nice to her
Monsieur said the Frenchman after an instants reflection I offer none
I did not at the moment perceive the spirit of your words but I recognize now that it was delicacy itself
I tender you the most profound thanksfor ALL the family
After some further conversation the elder Fromentin took his departure
Lord Chaldon apparently proposed to accompany him but Thorpe begged him to remain and he put aside his hat once more and resumed his seat
Thorpe walked about a little with his hands in his pockets in a restless way
If it isnt unpleasant to you I think Ill light a cigar he said suddenly and moved over to the cabinet
He poured out a drink of neat brandy as well and furtively swallowed it
Then he came back preceded by a cloud of smoke
It went terribly against the grain he said with a rueful laugh
Id sworn to let no Jew off with an inch of hide left on himand here three of them have been wheedled out of my grip already
Jews
exclaimed the Marquis much puzzled
Did youdid you think Fromentin was a Jew
God bless me
hes no more one than I am
Why not even so much for there IS a Herschell in my pedigree
Why dear man they were Crusaders
Thorpe smiled somewhat sheepishly
I never noticed much he said
It was a foreignlooking name
I took it for granted
Lord Chaldon bent his brows a little
Yesshe murmured meditatively
Ive heard it mentioned that your enterprise was suspected of an antiSemitic twist
Do you mind my talking a little with you about that
Oh not at all the other answered with languid acquiescence as he seated himself
CHAPTER XVII LORD CHALDONS instructive little monologue on the subject of the Hebrew in finance afforded Thorpe a certain pleasure which was in its character perhaps more social than intellectual
It was both a flattering and striking experience to have so eminent a man at the side of ones desk revealing for ones guidance the secrets of sovereigns and cabinets
Great names were mentioned in the course of this dissertationmentioned with the authoritative ease of one who dined with princes and prime ministersand Thorpe felt that he shared in the distinction of this familiarity with the august
He was in the position of paying a salary to this courtly old nobleman and statesman who could tell him of his own intimate knowledge how Emperors conversed with one another how the Pope fidgeted in his ornatecarved chair when the visitor talked on unwelcome topics how a Queen and an operabouffe dancer waged an obscure and envenomed battle for the possession of a countinghouse strong box and in the outcome a nation was armed with inferior old muskets instead of modern weapons and the girl got the difference expressed in black pearls
These reminiscences seemed to alter the atmosphere and even the appearance of the Board Room
It was almost as if the apartment itself was becoming historic like those chambers they pointed out to the tourist wherein crowned heads had slept
The manner of the Marquis lent itself charmingly to this illusion
He spoke in a facile mellifluous voice and as fluently as if he had been at work for a long time preparing a dissertation on this subject instead of taking it up now by chance
In his tone in his gestures in the sustained friendliness of his facial expressions there was a palpable desire to please his auditorand Thorpe gave more heed to this than to the thread of the discourse
The facts that he heard now about the Jewish masters of international finance were doubtless surprising and suggestive to a degree but somehow they failed to stimulate his imagination
Lord Chaldons statesmanlike discussion of the uses to which they put this vast power of theirs his conviction that on the whole they were beneficent his dread of the consequences of any organized attempt to take this power away from them and put it into other and less capable handsno doubt it was all very clever and wise but Thorpe did not care for it
At the end he nodded and with a lumbering movement altered his position in his chair
The fixed idea of despoiling Rostocker Aronson Ganz Rothfoere Lewis and Mendel of their last sixpence had been in no wise affected by this entertaining homily
There appeared to be no need of pretending that it had been
If he knew anything of men and their manners his titled friend would not object to a change of topic
Lord Chaldon he said abruptly weve talked enough about general matters
While youre here we might as well go into the subject of the Company
Our annual meeting is pretty nearly duebut I think it would be better to have it postponed
You see this extraordinary development of dealing in our shares on the Stock Exchange has occupied my entire attention
There has been no time for arranging the machinery of operations on our property in Mexico
Its still there its all right
But for the time being the operations in London are so much more important
We should have nothing to tell our shareholders if we brought them together except that their onepound shares are worth fifteen pounds and they know that already
The Marquis had listened with a shrewdly attentive eye upon the speakers face
The nervous affection of his eyelids gave him now a minute of blinking leisure in which to frame his comment
I have not heard that my shares are worth fifteen pounds he said then with a direct meaning little smile
No Thorpe laughed leaning comfortably back in his chair
Thats what I want to talk to you about
You see when the Company was started it was impossible to foresee that this dealing in our ordinary shares would swamp everything else
If things had taken their usual course and we had paid our attention to Mexico instead of to the London Stock Exchange my deferred vendors shares two thousand of which you hold would by this time be worth a good bit
As it is unfortunately they are outside of the deal
They have nothing to do with the movement of the ordinary shares
But of course you understand all that
Lord Chaldon assented by an eloquent nod at once resigned and hopeful
Wellthat is contrary to all my expectationsand intentions Thorpe resumed
I dont want you to suffer by this unlookedfor change in the shape of things
You hold two thousand sharesonly by accident theyre the wrong kind of shares
Very well Ill make them the right kind of shares
Ill have a transfer sent to you tomorrow so that you can return those vendors shares to me and in exchange for them Ill give you two thousand fullypaid ordinary shares
You can sell these at once if you like or you can hold them on over one more settlement whichever you please
This is very munificent remarked Lord Chaldon after an instants selfcommunion
His tone was extremely gracious but he displayed none of the enthusiastic excitement which Thorpe perceived now that he had looked for
The equanimity of Marquises who were also exAmbassadors was evidently a deeperrooted affair than he had supposed
This elderly and urbane diplomat took a gift of thirty thousand pounds as he might have accepted a superior cigar
A brief pause ensued and was ended by another remark from the nobleman I thought for the moment of asking your adviceon this question of selling he continued
But it will be put more appropriately perhaps in this way Let me leave it entirely in your hands
Whatever you do will be right
I know so little of these thingsand you know so much
Thorpe put out his lips a trifle and looked away for an instant in frowning abstraction
If it were put in that wayI think I should sell he said
Its all right for me to take long chancesits my gamebut theres no reason why you should risk things
But let me put it in still another way he added with the passing gleam of a new thought over the dull surface of his eye
What do you say to our making the transaction strictly between ourselves
Here are shares to bearer in the safe there
I say that two thousand of them are yours that makes them yours
I give you my cheque for thirty thousand poundshere now if you likeand that makes them mine again
The business is finished and done withinside this room
Neither of us is to say anything about it to a soul
Does that meet your views
The diplomat pondered the propositionagain with a lengthened perturbation of the eyelids
It would be possible to suggest a variety of objections if one were of a sophistical turn of mind he said at last smilingly reflective
Yet I see no really insuperable obstacle in the path
He thought upon it further and went on with an enquiring upward glance directed suddenly at Thorpe Is there likely to be any very unpleasant hubbub in the presswhen it is known that the annual meeting has been postponed
Thorpe shook his head with confidence
Noyou need have no fear of that
The press is all right
Its the talk of the City Im toldthe way Ive managed the press
It isnt often that a man has all three of the papers walking the same chalkline
The Marquis considered these remarks with a puzzled air
Then he smiled faintly
Im afraid were speaking of different things he suggested
Apparently you refer to the financial papers
I had scarcely given them a thought
It does not seem to me that I should mind particularly what they said about mebut I should care a great deal about the other pressthe great public press
Oh what do they know about these things
said Thorpe lightly
So far as I can see they dont know about anything unless it gets into the police court or the divorce court or a court of some kind
Theyre the funniest sort of papers I ever saw
Seems as if they didnt think anything was safe to be printed until it had been sworn to
Why anybody should be afraid of them is more than I can see
Nevertheless persisted his Lordship blandly I should greatly dislike any public discussion of our Companys affairs
I hope it is quite clear that that can be avoided
Absolutely
Thorpe told him with reassuring energy
Why discussions dont make themselves
Somebody has to kick before anything gets discussed
And who is to kick here
The public who hold the shares are not likely to complain because theyve gone up fifteen hundred or two thousand per cent
And who else has any interest in what the Company as a Company does
Ah that is a question which has occurred to me said Lord Chaldon and I shall be glad if it is already answered
The only people likely to kick as you put it so simply would be I take it Directors and other officers of the Company who find themselves holding a class of shares which does not participate in the present rise
I speak with some confidencebecause I was in that position myself until a few minutes agoand I dont mind confessing that I had brought myself to contemplate the contingency of ultimately being compelled toto kick a little
Of course so far as I am concerned events have put me in a diametrically different frame of mind
If I came preparedI wont say to curse but toto criticizeI certainly remain to bless
But you see my point
I of course do not know what you have done as regards the other members of the Board
I dont care about them said Thorpe carelessly
You are the one that I wished to bring in on the groundfloor
The others dont matter
Of course I shall do something for them they shant be allowed to make troubleeven supposing that it would be in their power to make trouble which isnt the case
But it wont be done by any means on the same scale that he paused abruptly and the two men tacitly completed his sentence in the glance they exchanged
The Marquis of Chaldon rose and took up his hat and stick
If you will post it to mein a registered lettermy town houseplease he remarked with a charmingly delicate hesitation over the phrases
Then he put out his hand I need not say how fully I appreciate your great kindness to my old friend Fromentin
It was a noble actionone I shall always reflect upon with admiration
I hope you wont mention it though said Thorpe as they shook hands either that oror anything else
I shall preserve the most guardedthe most diplomatic secrecy his Lordship assured him as they walked toward the door
Thorpe opened this door and stepped aside with a half bow to facilitate the exit of the Marquis who bent gracious acknowledgment of the courtesy
Then with an abrupt start of surprise the two men straightened themselves
Directly in front of them leaning lightly against the brassrail which guarded the entrance to the Board Room stood Lord Plowden
A certain sense of confusion unwelcome but inevitable visibly enveloped this chance meeting
The Marquis blinked very hard as he exchanged a fleeting handshake with the younger nobleman and murmured some indistinguishable commonplaces
Then with a graceful celerity which was more than diplomatic he disappeared
Thorpe with more difficulty recovered a sort of stolidity of expression that might pass for composure
He in turn gave his hand to the newcomer and nodded to him and achieved a doubtful smile
Come in
he said haltingly
Where did you drop from
Glad to see you
How are all your people
A moment later the young Viscount was seated in the chair which the elderly Marquis had vacated
He presented therein a figure which in its way was perhaps as courtly as the other had beenbut the way was widely different
Lord Plowdens fine lithe form expressed no deference in its easy postures
His handsome face was at no pains to assume conciliatory or ingratiating aspects
His brilliant brown eyes sparkled a confident buoyant gaze full into the heavy lethargic countenance of the big man at the desk
I havent bothered you before he said tossing his gloves into his hat and spreading his frockcoat out by its silk lapels
He crossed his legs and sat back with a comfortable smile
I knew you were awfully busyand I kept away as long as I could
But nowwell the truth isIm in rather of a hole
I hope you dont mind my coming
Why not at all said Thorpe laconically
After a momentary pause he added The Marquis has just been consulting me about the postponement of the annual meeting
I suppose you agree with usthat it would be better to put it off
Theres really nothing to report
Of course you know more about the situation than he doesbetween ourselves
The shareholders dont want a meeting its enough for them that their shares are worth fifteen or twenty times what they paid for them
And certainly WE dont need a meeting as things stand now
Ah yeshow do things stand now
asked Lord Plowden briskly
WellThorpe eyed his visitor with a moody blankness of gaze his chin once more buried in his collarwell everything is going all right as far as I can see
But of course these dealings in our shares in the City have taken up all my timeso that I havent been able to give any attention to starting up work in Mexico
That being the case I shall arrange to foot all the bills for this years expensesthe rent the Directors fees and clerkhire and so onout of my own pocket
It comes all told to about 2700 poundswithout counting my extra 1000 pounds as Managing Director
I dont propose to ask for a penny of that under the circumstancesand Ill even pay the other expenses
So that the Company isnt losing a penny by our not getting to work at the development of the property
No one could ask anything fairer than thatAnd are your mother and sister quite well
Oh very well indeed thanks replied the other
He relapsed abruptly into a silence which was plainly preoccupied
Something of the radiant cheerfulness with which his face had beamed seemed to have faded away
Im in treaty for a house and a moor in the HighlandsThorpe went on in a casual tonein fact Im hesitating between three or four places that all seem to be pretty goodbut I dont know whether I can get away much before the twentieth
I hope you can contrive to come while Im there
I should like it very much if you would bring your mother and sisterand your brother too
I have a nephew about his agea fine young fellowwhod be company for him
Why cant you say now that youll all come
Lord Plowden emerged from his brown study with the gleam of some new idea on his face
I might bring my sister he said
My mother hates Scotland
She doesnt go about either even in England
But I daresay Winnie would enjoy it immensely
She has a great opinion of you you know
I only saw her that once Thorpe remarked
Some thought behind his words lent a musing effect to the tone in which they were uttered
The brothers contemplative smile seemed a comment upon this tone
Women are curious creatures he said
They take fancies and dislikes as swiftly and irresponsibly as cloudshadows shift and change on a mountainside in April
But I happen to know that my sister does like you immensely
So does my mother he added with another little smile
He continued to regard Thorpes face but there was an increasing uncertainty in his glance
Youve put on flesh havent you
he ventured after a brief pause
There was the implication in his voice and manner that he observed changes which disconcerted him
Not much I guess replied the other carelessly
Ive been sticking to the City pretty closely
Thats all
Theres nothing that a fortnights rest wont put right
I should like it firstrate to have you and your sister come
Ill let you know which place I decide upon
Very likely you can manage to bring her at the same time that some other ladies will be there
I expect Lady Cressage and Miss Madden you know
Lord Plowden stared at his friend
Are they back
Have they returned to England
he asked confusedly
Oh didnt you know
Thorpe pursued with an accession of amiability
He visibly had pleasure in the disclosure of the others ignorance
Theyve been in London for two or three weeks
That is Miss Madden has been taking flying trips to see cathedrals and so on but Lady Cressage has stayed in town
Their long journeyings have rather done her up
He looked Plowden straight in the eye and added with an air of deliberation Im rather anxious about her health
The nobleman frankly abandoned his efforts to maintain an undisturbed front
Youareanxious he repeated frowning in displeased wonderment
Why yeswhy not
demanded Thorpe with a sudden growl in his voice
As he covered the handsome Viscount with his heavy intent gaze impulses of wrath stirred within him
Why should this fop of a lordling put on this air of contemptuous incredulity
What is there so amazing about that
Why shouldnt I be anxious
The peremptory harshness of his manner and the scowl on his big lowering face brought a sort of self control back to the other
He shrugged his shoulders with an attempt at nonchalance
Why not indeed
he said as lightly as he could
With hands on knees he bent forward as if to rise
But perhaps Id better come in another day he suggested tentatively
Im interrupting you
Nosit still Thorpe bade him and then with chin settled more determinedly than ever in his cravat sat eyeing him in a long dour silence
Lord Plowden found it impossible to obtain from this massive apathetic visage any clue to the thoughts working behind it
He chanced to recall the time when he had discussed with Thorpe the meaning and values of this inscrutable expression which the latters countenance could assume
It had seemed interesting and even admirable to him thenbut then he had not foreseen the possibility that he himself might some day confront its adamantine barrier with a sinking heart
All at once he could bear this implacable sphinxgaze no longer
Im sure some other day would be better he urged with an open overture to propitiation in his tone
Youre not in the mood to be bothered with my affairs today
As much today as any other Thorpe answered him slowly
The other sat suddenly uprightand then upon a moments reflection rose to his feet
I dont in the least know what to make of all this he said with nervous precipitancy
If Ive offended you in any way say so and I will apologize at once
But treatment of this sort passes my comprehension
Thorpe in truth did not himself comprehend it much more clearly
Some strange freak of wilfulness impelled him to pursue this unintelligible persecution
Ive said nothing about any offense he declared in a hard deliberate voice
It is your own word
All the sameI mention the name of a ladya lady mind you whom I met under your own roofand you strike attitudes and put on airs as ifas if I wasnt good enough
Oh upon my word thats all rubbish
the other broke in
Nothing could have been further from my thoughts I assure you
Quite naturally I was surprised for the moment at a bit of unexpected newsbut that was all
I give you my word that was all
Very well then Thorpe consented grudgingly to mutter
He continued his sullen scrutiny of the man standing before him noting how the vivacity of his bearing had deteriorated in these few minutes
He had cut such a gallant figure when he entered the room with his sparkling eye and smile his almost jaunty manner his superior tailors plumageand now he was such a crestfallen and wilted thing
Remembering their last conversation togetherremembering indeed how full of liking for this young nobleman he had been when they last metThorpe paused to wonder at the fact that he felt no atom of pity for him now
What was his grievance
What had Plowden done to provoke this savage hostility
Thorpe could not tell
He knew only that unnamed forces dragged him forward to hurt and humiliate his former friend
Obscurely no doubt there was something about a woman in it
Plowden had been an admirer of Lady Cressage
There was her fathers word for it that if there had been money enough he would have wished to marry her
There had been as well the Generals hint that if the difficulty of Plowdens poverty were removed he might still wish to marry hera hint which Thorpe discovered to be rankling with a sudden new soreness in his mind
Was that why he hated Plowden
Nohe said to himself that it was not
He was going to marry Lady Cressage himself
Her letter signifying delicately her assent to his proposal had come to him that very morningwas in his pocket now
What did he care about the byegone aspirations of other wouldbe suitors
And as for Plowden he had not even known of her return to London
Clearly there remained no communications of any sort between them
It was not at all on her account he assured himself that he had turned against Plowden
But what other reason could there be
He observed his visitors perturbed and dejected mien with a grim kind of satisfactionbut still he could not tell why
This is all terribly important to me the nobleman said breaking the unpleasant silence
His voice was surcharged with earnestness
Apparently you are annoyed with somethingwhat it may be I cant for the life of me make out
All I can say isand he broke off with a helpless gesture which seemed to imply that he feared to say anything
Thorpe put out his lips
I dont know what you mean he said brusquely
What I meanthe other echoed with bewildered vagueness of glance
Im all at sea
I dont in the least grasp the meaning of anything
You yourself volunteered the declaration that you would do great things for me
We are rich men togetherthose were your own words
I urged you at the time to go slowlyto consider carefully whether you werent being too generous
I myself said to you that you were ridiculously exaggerating what you called your obligation to me
It was you who insisted upon presenting me with 100000 shares
Well they are here ready for you said Thorpe with calculated coldness
You can have them whenever you please
I promised them to you and set them aside for you
You can take them away with you now if you like
What are you kicking up this fuss for then
Upon my wordyou come here and suggest to me that I made promises to you which Ive broken
Plowden looked hard at him as he turned over in his mind the purport of these words
I see what you are doing he said then
You turn over to me 100000 vendors deferred shares
Thanks
I have already 1000 of them
I keep them in the same box with my fathers Confederate bonds
What the hell do you mean
Thorpe broke in with explosive warmth lifting himself in his chair
Oh come now Thorpe Plowden retorted lets get this talk on an intelligent commonsense footing
He had regained something of his selfcontrol and keenly put forward now to help him all his persuasive graces of eye and speech
He seated himself once more
Im convinced that you want to be good to me
Of course you do
If Ive seemed here for a minute or two to think otherwise it was because I misunderstood things
Dont let there be any further misunderstandings
I apologize for doing you the momentary injustice of suspecting that you were going to play off the vendors shares on me
Of course you said itbut it was a joke
There seems to be a joke somewhere sure enough said Thorpe in dryly metallic tonesbut it isnt me whos the joker
I told you you should have 100000 of my 400000 shares didnt I
I told you that in so many words
Very well what more do you want
Here they are for you
I keep my promise to the letter
But youyou seem to think youre entitled to make a row
What do you mean by it
Just a little wordinterposed Plowden with strenuous calmness of utterancewhat you say may be true enoughyes I admit it is true as far as it goes
But was that what either of us had in our minds at the time
You know it wasnt
You had just planned a coup on the Stock Exchange which promised you immense rewards
I helped you to pass a bogus allotment through our Boardwithout which your coup wouldnt have been worth a farthing
You were enthusiastically grateful to me then
In the excitement of the moment you promised me a quarter of all you should make
WE ARE BOTH RICH MEN
I remember those very words of yours
They have never been out of my mind
We discussed the things that we would each do when we came into this wealth
It was taken for granted in all our talk that your making money meant also my making money
That was the complete understandinghere in London and while you were at my house
You know it as well as I do
And I refuse to suppose that you seriously intend to sit there and pretend that you meant to give me nothing but an armful of waste paper
It would be too monstrous
Thorpe rapped with his nails on the desk to point the force of his rejoinder How do you account for the fact my Lordhe gave his words a chillingly scornful precision of utterancethat I distinctly mentioned 400000 vendors shares of mine 100000 of which I promised to turn over to you
Those were the specific terms were they not
You dont deny it
Then what are you talking about
I account for it in this waysaid Plowden after a moments baffled reflection at that time you yourself hadnt grasped the difference between the two classes of shares
You thought the vendors shares would play a part in the game
Ah
I see Ive hit the mark
That was the way of itAnd now here Thorpe
Let all thats been said be byegones
I dont want any verbal triumph over you
You dont want to wrong meand yourself tooby sticking to this quibble about vendors shares
You intended to be deuced good to meand what have I done that you should round on me now
I havent bothered you before
I came today only because things are particularly rotten financially just now
And I dont even want to hold you to a quarterI leave that entirely to you
But after all thats been said and doneI put it to you as one man to anotheryou are morally bound to help me out
How do you meanall thats been said and done
Thorpe asked the question in some confusion of moods
Perhaps it was the ethical force of Lord Plowdens appeal perhaps only a recurring sense of his earlier affection for the manbut for the moment he wavered in his purpose
The peer flushed a little as he looked at the floor revolving possible answers to this query
His ear had been quick to seize the note of hesitation in Thorpes tone
He strove anxiously to get together considerations which should tip the fluttering balance definitely his way
Well he began slowly I hardly know how to put it
Of course there was in the first place the immense expectation of fortune which you gave me and which Im afraid Ive more than lived up to
And then of course others shared my expectations
It wasnt a thing one could very well keep to oneself
My mother and my sisterespecially my sisterthey were wonderfully excited about it
You are quite the hero in their eyes
And thenyou remember that talk we had in which you said I could help yousocially you know
I did it a little just as a start but of course theres no end to what could be done
Youve been too busy heretofore but we can begin now whenever you like
I dont mind telling youIve had some thoughts of a possible marriage for you
In point of blood and connections it would be such a match as a commoner hasnt made before in my memorya highly cultivated and highlybred young lady of rankand settlements could be made so that a considerable quantity of land would eventually come to your son
I neednt tell you that land stands for much more than money if you happen to set your mind on a baronetcy or a peerage
Of courseI need scarcely sayI mention this marriage only as something which may or may not attract youit is quite open to you to prefer anotherbut there is hardly anything of that sort in which I and my connections could not be of use to you
Even more by the tone and inflection of these words than by the phrases themselves Thorpe divined that he was being offered the hand of the Hon
Winifred Plowden in marriage
He recalled vividly the fact that once the shadow of some such thought had floated through his own brain there had been a momentit seemed curiously remote like a dreamphantom from some previous state of existencewhen he had dwelt with personal interest upon her inheritance from long lines of noblemen and her relation to half the peerage
Then swiftly illogically he disliked the brother of this lady more than ever
All that is talking in the air he said with abrupt decision
I see nothing in it
You shall have your vendors shares precisely as I promised you
I dont see how you can possibly ask for anything more
He looked at the others darkling face for a moment and then rose with unwieldy deliberation
If youre so hard up though he continued coldly I dont mind doing this much for you
Ill exchange the thousand vendors shares you already hold the ones I gave you to qualify you at the beginningfor ordinary shares
You can sell those for fifteen thousand pounds cash
In fact Ill buy them of you now
Ill give you a cheque for the amount
Do you want it
Lord Plowden redfaced and frowning hesitated for a fraction of time
Then in constrained silence he nodded and Thorpe leaning ponderously over the desk wrote out the cheque
His Lordship took it folded it up and put it in his pocket without immediate comment
Then this is the end of things is it
he asked after an awkward silence in a voice he strove in vain to keep from shaking
What things
said the other
Plowden shrugged his shoulders framed his lips to utter something which he decided not to say and at last turned on his heel
Good day he called out over his shoulder and left the room with a flagrant air of hostility
Thorpe wandering about the apartment stopped after a time at the cabinet and helped himself to a drink
The thing most apparent to him was that of set purpose he had converted a friend into an enemy
Why had he done this
He asked himself the question in varying forms over his brandy and soda but no convincing answer came
He had done it because he had felt like doing it
It was impossible to trace motives further than that
CHAPTER XVIII EDITH will be down in a very few moments Miss Madden assured Thorpe that evening when he entered the drawingroom of the house she had taken in Grafton Street
He looked into her eyes and smiled as he bowed over the hand she extended to him
His glance expressed with forceful directness his thought Ah then she has told you
The complacent consciousness of producing a fine effect in eveningclothes had given to Mr Stormont Thorpe habitually now a mildness of manner after the dressing hour which was lacking to his deportment in the daytime
The conventional attire of ceremony juggled in the hands of an inspired tailor had been brought to lend to his ponderous figure a dignity and even something of a grace which the man within assimilated and made his own
It was an equable and rather amiable Thorpe whom people encountered after nightfalla gentleman who looked impressive enough to have powerful performances believed of him yet seemed withal an approachable and easygoing person
Men who saw him at midnight or later spoke of him to their womenkind with a certain significant reserve in which trained womankind read the suggestion that the Rubber King drank a good deal and was probably not wholly nice in his cups
This however could not be said to render him less interesting in any eyes
There was indeed about it the implication of a generous nature or at the least of a blind sideand it is not unpleasant to discover these attributes in a new man who has made his halfmillion and has or may have countless favours to bestow
It was as if his tongue instead of his eyes had uttered the exclamationAh then she has told you
for Miss Madden took it as having been spoken
Im not disposed to pretend that Im overjoyed about it you know she said to him bluntly as their hands dropped and they stood facing each other
If I said I congratulated you it would be only the emptiest form
And I hate empty forms
Why should you think that I wont make a good husband
Thorpe asked the question with a goodnatured if peremptory frankness which came most readily to him in the presence of this American lady herself so outspoken and masterful
I dont know that I specially doubt it she replied
I suppose any man has in him the makings of what is called a good husbandif the conditions are sufficiently propitious
Well thenwhats the matter with the conditions
he demanded jocosely
Miss Madden shrugged her shoulders slightly
Thorpe noted the somewhat luxuriant curves of these splendid shoulders and the creamy whiteness of the skin upon which round the full throat a chain of diamonds lay as upon satinand recalled that he had not seen her before in what he phrased to himself as so much lownecked dress
The deep firegleam in her broad plaits of hair gave a wonderful brilliancy to this colouring of brow and throat and bosom
He marvelled at himself for discovering only now that she also was beautifuland then thrilled with pride at the thought that henceforth his life might be passed altogether among beautiful women radiant in gems and costly fabrics who would smile upon him at his command
Oh I have no wish to be a killjoy she protested
Im sure I hope all manner of good results from the the experiment
I suppose thats what it comes to he said meditatively
Its all an experiment
Every marriage in the world must be thatneither more nor less
With all the experience of the ages against its coming out right
She had turned to move toward a chair but looked now over her shoulder at him
Have you ever seen what seemed to you an absolutely happy marriage in your life
Upon reflection he shook his head
I dont recall one on the spur of the minute he confessed
Not the kind I mean that you read about in books
But Ive seen plenty where the couple got along together in a good easy comfortable sort of way without a notion of any sort of unpleasantness
Its people who marry too young who do most of the fighting I imagine
After people have got to a sensible age and know what they want and what they can get along without why then theres no reason for any trouble
We dont start out with any schoolboy and schoolgirl moonshine Oh theres a good deal to be said for the moonshine she interrupted him as she sank upon the sofa
Why certainly he assented amiably as he stood looking down at her
The more there is of it the betterif it comes naturally and people know enough to understand that it is moonshine and isnt the beall and endall of everything
Theres a lover for you
Miss Madden cried with mirth and derision mingled in her laugh
Dont you worry about me he told her
Im a good enough lover all right
And when you come to that if Edith is satisfied I dont precisely see what What business it is of mine
she finished the sentence for him
Youre entirely right
As you say IF shes satisfied no one else has anything to do with it
But have you got any right to assume that she isnt satisfied
he asked her with swift directnessor any reason for supposing it
Miss Madden shook her head but the negation seemed qualified by the whimsical smile she gave him
None whatever she saidand on the instant the talk was extinguished by the entrance of Lady Cressage
Thorpes vision was flooded with the perception of his rare fortune as he went to meet her
He took the hand she offered and looked into the smile of her greeting and could say nothing
Her beauty had gathered to it new forces in his eyesforces which dazzled and troubled his glance
The thought that this exquisite beingthis ineffable compound of feeling and fine nerves and sweet wisdom and wit and lovelinessbelonged to him seemed too vast for the capacity of his mind
He could not keep himself from trembling a little and from diverting to a screen beyond her shoulder a gaze which he felt to be overtly dimmed and embarrassed
I have kept you waiting she murmured
The soft sound of her voice came to his ears as from a distance
It bore an unfamiliar note upon the strangeness of which he dwelt for a detached instant
Then its meaning broke in upon his consciousness from all sides and lighted up his heavy face with the glow of a conquerors selfcentred smile
He bent his eyes upon her and noted with a controlled exaltation how her glance in turn deferred to his and fluttered beneath it and shrank away
He squared his big shoulders and lifted his head
Still holding her jewelled hand in his he turned and led her toward the sofa
Halting he bowed with an exaggerated genuflection and flourish of his free hand to Miss Madden the while he flashed at her a glance at once of challenge and of deprecation
Through the sensitized contact of the other hand he felt that the woman he held bowed also and in his own spirit of confused defiance and entreaty
The laugh he gave then seemed to dispel the awkwardness which had momentarily hung over the mocking salutation
Miss Madden laughed too
Oh I surrender she said
You drag congratulations from me
Some quality in the tone of this ungracious speech had the effect of putting the party at its ease
Lady Cressage seated herself beside her friend on the sofa and gently abstractedly patted one of her hands
Thorpe remained on his feet looking down at the pair with satisfied cheerfulness
He tool a slip of paper from his pocket to support a statement he was making
Im forever telling you what a strain the City is on a man in my position he saidand today I had the curiosity to keep an account of what happened
Here it is
I had thirty callers
Of those how many do you suppose came to see me on my own business
Just eight
That is to say their errands were about investments of mine but most of them managed to get in some word about axes of their own to grind
All the rest made no pretence at all of thinking about anybody but themselves
Ive classified them one by one here
First there were six men who wanted me to take shares of one sort or another and I had to more or less listen to what they tried to make out their companies were like
They were none of them any good
Eight different fellows came to me with schemes that havent reached the company stage
One had a scheme for getting possession of a nigger republic in the West Indies by raising a loan and then repudiating all the previous loans
Another wanted me to buy a paper for him in which he was to support all my enterprises
Another wanted to start a bankI apparently to find the money and he the brains
One chap wanted me to finance a theatrical syndicatehe had a bag full of photographs of an actress all eyes and teeth and hairand another chap had a scheme all worked out for getting a concession from Spain for one of the Caroline Islands and putting up a factory there for making porpoisehide leather
Then there were three inventorslets see here they areone with a coiled wire spring for scissors inside a pocketknife and one with a bottle the whole top of which unscrews instead of having a cork or stopper and one with an electrical fishline a fine wire inside the silk you know which connects with some battery when a fish bites and rings a bell and throws out hooks in various directions and does all sorts of things
Well then there was a man who wanted me to take the chairmanship of a company and one who wanted me to guarantee an overdraft at his bank and two who wanted to borrow money on stock and one parsonfellow who tried to stick me for a subscription to some Home or other he said he had for children in the country
He was the worst bounder of the lot
Well theres twentyseven peopleand twenty of them strangers to me and not worth a penny to me and all trying to get money out of me
Isnt that a dogs life for one
I dont know said Miss Madden contemplatively
A lady may have twice that number of callers in an afternoonquite as great strangers to all intents and purposesand not even have the satisfaction of discovering that they had any object whatever in calling
At least your people had some motive the grey matter in their brain was working
And besides one of them might have had something to say which you would value
I dont think that ever happens among a ladys callers does it Edith
Edith smiled pleasantly and yet a little wistfully but said nothing
At any rate Thorpe went on with a kind of purpose gathering in his eyes none of those fellows cost me anything except in time
But then I had three callers almost in a bunch and one of them took out of me thirty thousand pounds and another fifteen thousand pounds and the thirdan utter stranger he washe got an absolute gratuity of ten thousand pounds besides my consent to a sale which if I had refused it would have stood me in perhaps forty or fifty thousand pounds more
You ladies may thank your stars you dont have that kind of callers
The sound of these figures in the air brought a constrained look to the faces of the women
Seemingly they confronted a subject which was not to their liking
The American however after a moments pause took it up in an indifferent manner
You speak of an absolute gratuity
I know nothing of London City methodsbut isnt ten thousand pounds a gratuity on a rather large scale
Thorpe hesitated briefly then smiled and with slow deliberation drew up a chair and seated himself before them
Perhaps I dont mind telling you about it he began and paused again
I had a letter in my mail this morning he went on at last giving a sentimental significance to both tone and glancea letter which changed everything in the world for me and made me the proudest and happiest man above ground
And I put that letter in my pocket right here on the left sideand its there now for that matterhe put his hand to his breast as if under the impulse to verify his words by the production of the missive and then stopped and flushed
The ladies watching him seemed by their eyes to condone the mawkishness of the demonstration which had tempted him
There was indeed a kind of approving interest in their joint regard which he had not experienced before
I had it in my pocket he resumed with an accession of mellow emotion in his voice and none of the callers ever got my thoughts very far from that letter
And one of these was an old mana French banker who must be seventy years old but dyes his hair a kind of purple blackand it seems that his nephew had got the firm into a terrible kind of scrape selling 2000 of my shares when he hadnt got them to sell and couldnt get themand the old man came to beg me to let him out at present market figures
He got Lord Chaldonhes my Chairman you knowto bring him and introduce him as his friend and plead for himbut I dont think all that by itself would have budged me an atom
But then the old man told how he was just able to scrape together money enough to buy the shares he needed at the ruling price and he happened to mention that his nieces marriage portion would have to be sacrificed
Well then do you know that letter in my pocket said something to meAndwell thats the story
The girl s portion I wormed it out of him was ten thousandand I struck that much off the figure that I allowed him to buy his shares and save his firm forIt was all the letter that did it mind you
He concluded the halting narrative amid a marked silence
The ladies looked at him and at each other but they seemed surprised out of their facility of comment
In this kind of flustered hush the door was opened and dinner was announced
Miss Madden welcomed the diversion by rising with ostentatious vigour
I will take myself out she declared with cheerful promptness leading the way
Lady Cressage took the arm Thorpe offered her and gave no token of comprehending that her wrist was being caressingly pressed against his side as they moved along
At the little table shining in the centre of the dark cool diningroom talk moved idly about among general topics
A thunderstorm broke over the town at an early stage of the dinner and the sound of the rushing downpour through the open windows and the breath of freshness which stirred the jaded air were pleasanter than any speech
Thoughts roved intuitively countryward where the longneeded rain would be dowering the landscape with new lifewhere the earth at sunrise would be green again and buoyant in reawakened energy and redolent with the perfumes of sweetest summer
They spoke of the fields and the moors with the longing of tired townfolk in August
Oh when I get awaysaid Thorpe fervently it seems to me that I dont want ever to come back
These last few weeks have got terribly on my nerve
And reallywhy should I come back
Ive been asking myself the questionmore today than ever before
Of course everything has been different today
But if Im to get any genuine good out of mymy fortuneI must pull away from the City altogether sometimeand why not now
Of course some important things are still openand they have to be watched night and daybut after all Semplethats my Brokerhe could do it for me
At the most it wont last more than another six weeks
There is a settlementday next week the 15th and another a fortnight after on the 29th and another on September 12th
Well those three days if theyre worked as I intend they shall be and nothing unforeseen happens will bring in over four hundred thousand pounds and close the corner in Rubber Consols for good
Then I need never see the City again thank God
And for that matterwhy what is six weeks
Its like tomorrow
Im going to act as if I were free already
The rain fills me full of the country
Will you both come with me tomorrow or next day and see the Pellesley place in Hertfordshire
By the photographs its the best thing in the market
The newest parts of it are Tudorand thats what Ive always wanted
How unexpected you are
commented Miss Madden
You are almost the last person I should have looked to for a sentiment about Tudor foundations
Thorpe put out his lips a trifle
Ah you dont know me he replied in a voice milder than his look had promised
Because Im rough and practical you mustnt think I dont know good things when I see them
Why all the world is going to have living proof very soonhe paused and sent a smile surcharged with meaning toward the silent member of the trioliving proof that Im the greatest judge of perfection in beauty of my time
He lifted his glass as he spoke and the ladies accepted with an inclination of the head and a touch of the wine at their lips his tacit toast
Oh I think I do know you said Celia Madden calmly discursive
Up to a certain point you are not so unlike other men
If people appeal to your imagination and do not contradict you or bore you or get in your way you are capable of being very nice indeed to them
But that isnt a very uncommon quality
What is uncommon in youat least that is my readingis something which according to circumstances may be nice or very much the other way about
Its something which stands quite apart from standards of morals or ethics or the ordinary emotions
But I dont know whether it is desirable for me to enter into this extremely personal analysis
Oh yes go on Thorpe urged her
He watched her face with an almost excited interest
WellI should say that you possessed a capacity for sudden and capricious action in large matters equally impatient of reasoning and indifferent to consequences which might be very awkward and even tragic to people who happened to annoy you or stand in your road
You have the kind of organization in which within a second without any warning or reason a passing whim may have worked itself up into an imperative lawsomething you must obey
The man smiled and nodded approvingly Youve got me down fine he said
I talk with a good deal of confidence she went on with a cheerless ruminative little laugh because it is my own organization that I am describing too
The difference is that I was allowed to exploit my capacity for mischief very early
I had my own way in my teensmy own money my own powerof course only of a certain sort and in a very small place
But I know what I did with that power
I spread trouble and misery about mealways of course on a small scale
Then a group of things happened in a kind of climaxa very painful climaxand it shook the nonsense out of me
My brother and my father diedsome other sobering things happenedand luckily I was still young enough to stop short and take stock of myself and say that there were certain paths I would never set foot on againand stick to it
But with youdo you seepower only comes to you when you are a mature man
Experiences no matter how unpleasant they are will not change you now
You will not be moved by this occurrence or that to distrust yourself or reconsider your methods or form new resolutions
Oh no
Power will be terrible in your hands if people whom you can injure provoke you to cruel courses Oh deardear
broke in Lady Cressage
What a distressing Mrs GummidgeCassandra you are Celia
Pray stop it
Noshes right enough said Thorpe gravely
Thats the kind of man I am
He seemed so profoundly interested in the contemplation of this portrait which had been drawn of him that the others respected his reflective silence
He sat for some moments idly fingering a fork on the table and staring at a blotch of vivid red projected through a decanter upon the cloth
It seems to me thats the only kind of man its worth while to be he added at last still speaking with thoughtful deliberation
Theres nothing else in the world so big as powerstrength
If you have that you can get everything else
But if you have it and dont use it then it rusts and decays on your hands
Its like a thoroughbred horse
You cant keep it idle in the stable
If you dont exercise it you lose it
He appeared to be commenting upon some illustration which had occurred to his own mind but was not visible to his auditors
While they regarded him he was prompted to admit them to his confidence
There was a case of it today he said and then paused
Precisely put in Miss Madden
The fact that some Frenchwoman of whom you had never heard before was going to lose her marriage portion caught your attention and on the instant you presented her with 10000 an exercise of power which happens to be on the generous sidebut still entirely unreasoning and not deserving of any intellectual respect
And heres the point if it had happened that somebody else chanced to produce an opposite impression upon you you would have been capable of taking 50000 away from him with just as light a heart
Thorpes face beamed with repressed amusement
As a matter of fact it was that kind of case I was going to mention
I wasnt referring to the girl and her marriage portion
A young man came to me todaycame into my room all cockawhoop smiling to himself with the notion that he had only to name what he wanted and I would give it to himand He stopped abruptly with a confused little laugh
He had been upon the brink of telling about Lord Plowdens discomfiture and even now the story itched upon his tongue
It cost him an effort to put the narrative aside the while he pondered the arguments which had suddenly reared themselves against publicity
When at last he spoke it was with a glance of conscious magnanimity toward the lady who had consented to be his wife
Never mind he said lightly
There wasnt much to it
The man annoyed me somehowand he didnt get what he came forthats all
But he was entitled to get it
asked Celia Madden
Thorpes lips pouted over a reply
Wellno he said with a kind of reluctance
He got strictly what he was entitled toprecisely what I had promised himand he wrung up his nose at thatand then I actually gave him 15000 pounds he wasnt entitled to at all
I hardly see what it proves then Edith Cressage remarked and the subject was dropped
Some two hours later Thorpe took his departure
It was not until he was getting into the hansom which had been summoned that it all at once occurred to him that he had not for a moment been alone with his betrothed
Upon reflection as the cab sped smoothly forward this seemed odd to him
He decided finally that there was probably some social rule about such things which he didnt understand
                 In the drawingroom of the house in Grafton Street which he had quitted the two ladies sat with faces averted from each other in constrained silence
Edith Cressage rose at last and took a few aimless steps with her hands at her hair
WellIm embarkedfairly under way
she said in clearcut almost provocative tones
I dont at all know what to say her companion replied slowly
I fancy that you exaggerate my disapproval
Perhaps it ought not even to be called disapproval at all
It is only that I am puzzledand a little frightened
Oh I am frightened too said the other but with eagerness rather than trepidation in her voice
That is why I did not give you the signal to leave us alone
I couldnt quite get up the nerve for it
But would you believe itthat is one of the charms of the thing
There is an excitement about it that exhilarates me
To get happiness through terroryou cant understand that can you
Im trying
I think Im beginning to understand said Miss Madden vaguely
Did you ever set yourself to comprehending why Marie Stuart married Bothwell
asked Edith looking down upon the other with illuminating fixity
You have it allall there
Marie got tired of the smooth people the usual people
There was the promise of adventure and risk and peril and the grand emotions with the big dark brute
It isnt a happy storythis parallel that you pick out commented Celia absently
Happy
Pah
retorted Edith with spirit
Who knows if it wasnt the only really happy thing in her life
The snobs and prigs all scold her and preach sermons at herthey did it in her lifetime they do it nowOh come Im neither a snob nor a prig put in Celia looking up in her turn and tempering with a smile the energy of her toneI dont blame her for her Bothwell I dont criticize her
I never was even able to mind about her killing Darnley
You see I take an extremely liberal view
One might almost call it broad
But if I had been one of her ladiesher bosom friendssay Catherine Setonand she had talked with me about itI think I should have confessed to some forebodingssome little misgivings
And do you know what she would have said
Ediths swift question put with a glowing face and a confident voice had in it the ring of assured triumph
She would have answered you My dearest girl all my life I have done what other people told me to do
In my childhood I was given in marriage to a criminal idiot
In my premature widowhood I was governed by a committee of scoundrels of both sexes until another criminal idiot was imposed upon me as a second husband
My own personality has never had the gleam of a chance
I have never yet done any single thing because I wanted to do it
Between first my politicianmother and her band of tonsured swindlers and then my cantankerous brother and his crew of snarling and sourminded preachers and all the court liars and parasites and spies that both sides surrounded me with I have lived an existence that isnt life at all
I purport to be a woman but I have never been suffered to see a genuine man
And now here is oneor what I think to be oneand Im given to understand that he is a pirate and a murderer and an unspeakable ruffian generallybut he takes my fancy and he has beckoned to me to come to him and so you will kindly get me my hat and jacket and gloves
Thats what she would have said to you my dear
And Isaid Celia rising after a moments pause and putting her hand upon Ediths armI would have answered Dearest lady in whatever befalls I pray you never to forget that I am to the end your fond and devoted and loyal servant
CHAPTER XIX AUGUST wore itself out in parched tedium and a September began which seemed even more unbearable in townand still Thorpe did not get away from London
So far as the payment of an exorbitant rent in advance and the receipt of innumerable letters from a restless and fussy steward whom he had not yet seen went as evidence he knew himself to be the tenant in possession of a great shooting in Morayshire
He had several photographs of what was called the lodge but looked like something between a mansion and a baronial castle on the mantel of the Board Room
The reflection that this sumptuous residence had been his for a month and that it daily stood waiting for him furnished and swept and provisioned for his coming did nothing to help the passing of time in the hot fagged City
More than once he had said resolutely that on the morrow or at the worst the next day he would gobut in the event he had not gone
In the last week of August he had proceeded to the length of sending his niece and nephew Northward and shutting up the house in Ovington Square and betaking himself to the Savoy Hotel
This had appeared at the time to be almost equivalent to his getting away himselfto be at least a first stage in the progress of his own journey
But at the hotel he had stuck fastand now on the tenth of September was no nearer the moors and the deerforest than he had been a month before
A novel sense of lonelinessof the fatuity of present existenceweighed grievously upon him
The ladies of Grafton Street had left town upon a comprehensive itinerary of visits which included the Malvern country and a ducal castle in Shropshire and a place in Westmoreland
There was nothing very definite about the date of their coming to him in Scotland
The lady who had consented to marry him had somehow omitted to promise that she would write to him
An arrangement existed instead by which she and his niece Julia were to correspond and to fix between themselves the details of the visit to Morayshire
Thorpe hardly went to the point of annoyance with this arrangement
He was conscious of no deep impulse to write loveletters himself and there was nothing in the situation which made his failure to receive love letters seem unnatural
The absence of moonshine at least during this preliminary season had been quite taken for granted between them and he did not complain even to himself
There was even a kind of proud satisfaction for him in the thought that though he had all but completed the purchase of the noble Pellesley estate for Edith Cressage he had never yet kissed her
The reserve he imposed upon himself gave him a certain aristocratic fineness in his own eyes
It was the means by which he could feel himself to be most nearly her equal
But he remained very lonely in London none the less
It is true that a great deal of society was continually offered to him and even thrust upon him
In the popular phrase London was empty but there seemed to be more people than ever who desired Mr Stormont Thorpe s presence at their dinnertables or their little theatre or card or river parties
He clung sullenly to his rule of going nowhere but it was not so simple a matter to evade the civilities and importunities of those who were stopping at the hotel or who came there to waylay him at the entrance or to encounter him in the restaurant
He could not always refuse to sit down at tables when attractivelydressed and vivacious women made room for him or to linger over cigars and wine with their husbands and escorts later on
An incessant and spirited court was paid to him by many different groups of interested people who were rarely at the pains to dissemble their aims
He formed a manner for the reception of these advances compounded of joviality cynicism and frank brutality which nobody to his face at least resented
If women winced under his mocking rudenesses of speech and smile if men longed to kill him for the cold insolence of his refusal to let them inside his guard they sedulously kept it from him
The consciousness that everybody was afraid of himthat everybody would kneel to him and meekly take insult and ignominy from him if only hope remained to them of getting something out of himhardened like a crust upon his mind
It was impossible to get a sense of companionship from people who cringed to him and swallowed his affronts and cackled at his jokes with equal docility
Sometimes he had a passing amusement in the rough pleasantries and cruelties which they drew from him
There were two or three bright Jewish women more gayly clever and impudent perhaps than beautiful with whom he found it genuine fun to talk and concerning whom he was perpetually conceiving projects which could not have been discussed with their husbands and as perpetually doing nothing to test their feasibility
But these diversions were in their essence unsubstantial
There was not even the semblance of a real friendship among themand loneliness became an increasing burden
His sister at the old bookshop exasperated him nowadays to a degree which often provoked within him the resolution to have done with her
He had a score of projects for her betterment each capable of as many variations and eager adaptations to suit her fancy but to them all and sundry she opposed a barrier of stupidly passive negation
There was nothing she wanted done for her
She would not exchange the work she had been brought up in for a life of idleness
She did not want and would not know what to do with a bigger shop than she had
An augmentation of her capital would be of no use because there was no room in the crowded little shop for a larger stock than it contained
She was entirely satisfied with the dingy home overhead and declined to think even of moving elsewhere
Over and over again she met his propositions with a saying which he could recall having particularly hated on their fathers lipsIts ill teaching an old dog new tricks
You ought to have them taught you with a stick he had told her roundly on the last occasion
She had merely shrugged her gaunt shoulders at him
You think you can bully everybody and make them crawl to youbut theres no good your trying it on with me she had told him and he had pushed his way out of the shop almost stamping his feet
It was clear to him at that moment that he would never darken her door again
Yet now on this afternoon of the tenth as he lounged with a cigar and a City paper in his apartment at the hotel after luncheon wondering whether it were too hot to issue forth for a walk to the Park the irrelevant idea of going round to see his sister kept coming into his mind
He seated himself and fastened his attention upon the paperbut off it slipped again to the old bookshop and to that curious crossgrained figure its mistress
He abandoned himself to thinking about herand discovered that a certain unique quality in her challenged his admiration
She was the only absolutely disinterested person he knewthe only creature in the world apparently who did not desire to make something out of him
She was not at all well offwas indeed rather poor than otherwiseand here was her only brother a millionaire and in her dumb way she had a sisterly affection for him and yet she could not be argued or cajoled into touching a penny of his money
Surely there could be no other woman like her
Thorpe realized that it was a distinction to have such a sisterand behind this thought rose obscurely the suggestion that there must be wonderful blood in a race which had produced such a daughter
And for that matter such a son too
He lifted his head and looked abstractedly before him as if he were gazing at some apotheosis of himself in a mirror
He beheld all at once something concrete and personal obtruded into the heart of his reverie the sight of which dimly astounded him
For the moment with opened lips he stared at itthen slowly brought himself to comprehend what had happened
An old man had by some oversight of the hotel servants been allowed to enter the room unannounced
He had wandered in noiselessly and had moved in a purblind fashion to the centre of the apartment
The vagueness of the expression on his face and of his movements hinted at a vacant mind or too much drinkbut Thorpe gave no thought to either hypothesis
The face itselfnoyesit was the face of old Tavender
In the name of God
What are you doing here
Thorpe gasped at this extraordinary apparition
Still staring he began to push back his chair and put his weight upon his feet
WellThorpethe other began thrusting forward his head to look through his spectaclesso it is you after all
I didnt know whether I was going to find you or not
This place has got so many turns and twists to it But good heavens
interposed the bewildered Thorpe
He had risen to his feet
He mechanically took the hand which the other had extended to him
What in hellhe began and broke off again
The aroma of alcohol on the air caught his sense and his mind stopped at the perception that Tavender was more or less drunk
He strove to spur it forward to compel it to encompass the meanings of this new crisis but almost in vain
Thought Id look you up said the old man buoyantly
Nobody in London Id rather see than you
How are you anyway
What did you come over for
When did you get here
Thorpe put the questions automatically
His selfcontrol was returning to him his capable brain pushed forward now under something like disciplined direction
Why I guess I owe it all to you replied Tavender
Traces of the old Quaker effect which had been so characteristic of him still hung about his garb and mien but there shone a new assurance on his benignant rubicund face
Prosperity had visibly liberalized and enheartened him
He shook Thorpes hand again
Yes sirit must have been all through you
he repeated
I got my cable three weeks agoHasten to London urgent business expenses and liberal fee guaranteed Rubber Consolsthats what the cable said that is the first one and of course youre the man that introduced me to those rubber people
And so dont you see I owe it all to you
His insistence upon his obligation was suddenly almost tearful
Thorpe thought hard as he replied Ohthats all right
Im very glad indeed to have helped you along
And so you came over for the Rubber Consols people eh
Wellthats good
Seen em yet
You havent told me when you landed
Came up from Southampton this morning
My brotherinlaw was down there to meet me
We came up to London together
Your brotherinlaw observed Thorpe meditatively
Some shadowy remote impression of having forgotten something troubled his mind for an instant
Is your brotherinlaw in the rubber business
Extraornary thing explained Tavender beamingly he dont know no more about the whole affair than the man n the moon
I asked him todaybut he couldnt tell me anything about the businesswhat it was Id been sent for or anything
But hehe knew youd been sent for Thorpe commented upon brief reflection
Why he sent the second cable himself What second cable
Why it was the next dayor maybe it was sent that same night and not delivered till morningI got another cable this time from my brotherinlaw telling me to cable him what ship I sailed on and when
So of course he knew all about itbut now he says he dont
Hes a curious sort of fellow anyway
But how is he mixed up in it
demanded Thorpe impatiently
Well as nearly as I can figure it out he works for one of the men thats at the head of this rubber company
It appears that he happened to show this manhes a man of title by the waya letter I wrote to him last spring when I got back to Mexicoand so in that way this man when he wanted me to come over just told Gafferson to cable to me
Gafferson Thorpe repeated very slowly and with almost an effect of listlessness
He was conscious of no surprise it was as if he had divined all along the sinister shadows of Lord Plowden and Lord Plowdens gardener lurking in the obscurity behind this egregious old ass of a Tavender
Hes a tremendous horticultural sharp said the other
Probably youve heard tell of him
Hes taken medals for new flowers and things till you cant rest
Hes over atwhat do you call itthe Royal Aquarium now to see the Dahlia Show
I went over there with him but it didnt seem to be my kind of a show and so I left him there and Im to look in again for him at 530
Im going down to his place in the country with him tonight to meet his bossthe nobleman I spoke of
Thats nice Thorpe commented slowly
I envy anybody who can get into the country these days
But how did you know I was here
The woman in the bookstore told meI went there the first thing
You might be sure Id look you up
Nobody was ever a better friend than youve been to me Thorpe
And do you know what I want you to do
I want you to come right bang out now and have a drink with me
I was thinking of something of the sort myself the big man replied
Ill get my hat and be with you in a minute
In the next room he relinquished his countenance to a frown of fierce perplexity
More than a minute passed in this scowling preoccupation
Then his face lightened with the relief of an idea and he stepped confidently back into the parlour
Come along he said jovially
Well have a drink downstairs and then well drive up to Hanover Square and see if we cant find a friend of mine at his club
In the office below he stopped long enough to secure a considerable roll of banknotes in exchange for a cheque
A little later a hansom deposited the couple at the door of the Asian Club and Thorpe in the outer hallway of this institution clicked his teeth in satisfaction at the news that General Kervick was on the premises
The General having been found by a boy and brought down extended to his guests a hospitality which was none the less urbane for the evidences of surprise with which it was seasoned
He concealed so indifferently his inability to account for Tavender that the anxious Thorpe grew annoyed with him but happily Tavenders perceptions were less subtle
He gazed about him in his dimeyed way with childlike interest and babbled cheerfully over his liquor
He had not been inside a London club before and his glimpse of the readingroom where isolated purplefaced retired old Empiremakers sat snorting in the silence their gouty feet propped up on footrests their white brows scowling over the pages of French novels particularly impressed him
It was a new and halcyon vision of the way to spend ones declining years
And the big smokingroomwhere the leather cushions were so low and so soft and the connection between the bells and the waiters was so efficientthat was even better
Thorpe presently made an excuse for taking Kervick apart
I brought this old jackass here for a purpose he said in low gravely mandatory tones
He thinks hes got an appointment at 530 this afternoonbut hes wrong
He hasnt
Hes not going to have any appointment at allfor a long time yet
I want you to get him drunk there where he sits and then take him away with you and get him drunker still and then take a train with him somewhereany station but Charing Cross or that lineand I dont care where you land with himScotland or Ireland or Francewhatever you like
Heres some money for youand you can write to me for more
I dont care what you say to himmake up any yarn you likeonly keep him pacified and keep him away from London and dont let a living soul talk to himtill I give you the word
Youll let me know where you are
Ill get away nowand mind General a good deal depends on the way you please me in this thing
The soldiers richlyflorid face and intent bulging blue eyes expressed vivid comprehension
He nodded with eloquence as he slipped the notes into his trousers pocket
Absolutely he murmured with martial brevity from under his white tight moustache
With only a vague word or two of meaningless explanation to Tavender Thorpe took his departure and walked back to the hotel
From what he had learned and surmised it was not difficult to put the pieces of the puzzle together
This ridiculous old fool he remembered now had reproached himself when he was in England before for his uncivil neglect of his brotherinlaw
By some absurd chance this damned brotherinlaw happened to be Gafferson
It was clear enough that when he returned to Mexico Tavender had written to Gafferson explaining the unexpected pressure of business which had taken up all his time in England
Probably he had been idiot enough to relate what he of course regarded as the most wonderful piece of good newshow the worthless concession he had been deluded into buying had been bought back from him
As likely as not he had even identified the concession and given Thorpes name as that of the man who had first impoverished and then mysteriously enriched him
At all events he had clearly mentioned that he had a commission to report upon the Rubber Consols property and had said enough else to create the impression that there were criminal secrets connected with its sale to the London Company
The rest was easy
Gafferson knowing Lord Plowdens relation to the Company had shown him Tavenders letter
Lord Plowden meditating upon it had seen a way to be nastyand had vindictively plunged into it
He had brought Tavender from Mexico to London to use him as a weapon
All this was as obvious as the nose on ones face
But a weapon for what
Thorpe as this question put itself in his mind halted before a shopwindow full of softhued silk fabrics to muse upon an answer
The delicate tints and surfaces of what was before his eyes seemed somehow to connect themselves with the subject
Plowden himself was delicatelytinted and refined of texture
Vindictiveness was too plain and coarse an emotion to sway such a complicated and polished organism
He reasoned it out as he stood with lacklustre gaze before the plateglass front aloof among a throng of eager and talkative women who pressed around himthat Plowden would not have spent his money on a mere impulse of mischiefmaking
He would be counting upon something more tangible than revengesomething that could be counted and weighed and converted into a bankbalance
He smiled when he reached this conclusiongreatly surprising and confusing a matronly lady into whose correct face he chanced to be looking at the instantand turning slowly continued his walk
At the office of the hotel he much regretted not having driven instead for he learned that Semple had twice telephoned from the City for him
It was late in the afternoonhe noted with satisfaction that the clock showed it to be already past the hour of the TavenderGafferson appointmentbut he had Semples office called up upon the chance that someone might be there
The clerk had not consumed more than ten minutes in the preliminaries of finding out that no one was thereThorpe meanwhile passing savage comments to the other clerks about the British official conception of the telephone as an instrument of discipline and humiliationwhen Semple himself appeared in the doorway
The Broker gave an exclamation of relief at seeing Thorpe and then apparently indifferent to the display of excitement he was exhibiting drew him aside
Come somewhere where we can talk he whispered nervously
Thorpe had never seen the little Scotchman in such a flurry
Well go up to my rooms he said and led the way to the lift
Upstairs Semple bolted the door of the sittingroom behind them and satisfied himself that there was no one in the adjoining bedroom
Then unburdening himself with another sigh he tossed aside his hat and looked keenly up at the big man
Theres the devil to pay he said briefly
Thorpe had a fleeting pride in the lethargic composed front he was able to present
All right he said with forced placidity
If hes got to be paid well pay him
He continued to smile a little
Its nah joke the other hastened to warn him
I have it from two different quarters
An application has been made to the Stock Exchange Committee this afternoon to intervene and stop our business on the ground of fraud
It comes verra straight to me
Thorpe regarded his Broker contemplatively
The news fitted with precision into what he had previously known it was rendered altogether harmless by the precautions he had already taken
Well keep your hair on he said quietly
If there were fifty applications they wouldnt matter the worth of that sodawater cork
Wont you have a drink
Semple upon reflection said he would
The unmoved equipoise of the big man visibly reassured him
He sipped at his bubbling tumbler and smacked his thin lips
Man Ive had an awful fright he said at last in the tone of one whose ease of mind is returning
I gave you credit for more nerve observed the other eyeing him in not unkindly fashion over his glass
Youve been so plumb full of sand all the whileI didnt think youd weaken now
Why were within two days of home nowand for you to get rattled at this late houryou ought to be ashamed of yourself The Scotchman looked into the bottom of his glass as he turned it thoughtfully round
Im relieved to see the way you take it he said after a pause
With increased hesitation he went dryly on Ive never enquired minutely into the circumstances of the flotation
It has not seemed to be my business to do so and upon advice I may say that the Committee would not hold that such was my business
My position is quite clear upon that point
Oh perfectly Thorpe assented
It couldnt possibly be any of your businesseither then or now
He gave a significant touch of emphasis to these last two words
Precisely said Semple with a glance of swift comprehension
You must not think I am asking any intrusive questions
If you tell me thatthat there is no ground for uneasinessI am verra pleased indeed to accept the assurance
That is ample information for my purposes
You can take it from me Thorpe told him
He picked up a red book from a side table and turned over its pages with his thick thumb
This is what Rule 59 says he went on NO APPLICATION WHICH HAS FOR ITS OBJECT TO ANNUL ANY BARGAIN IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE SHALL BE ENTERTAINED BY THE COMMITTEE UNLESS UPON A SPECIFIC ALLEGATION OF FRAUD OR WILFUL MISREPRESENTATION
Shall be entertained dye see
They cant even consider anything of the sort because it says specific and I tell you plainly that anything specific is entirely out of the question
The Broker lifted his sandy brows in momentary apprehension
If it turns upon the precise definition of a word he remarked doubtingly
Ah yesbut it doesnt Thorpe reassured him
See hereIll tell you something
Youre not asking any questions
Thats as it should be
And Im not forcing information upon you which you dont need in your business
Thats as it should be too
But in between these two theres a certain margin of facts that theres no harm in your knowing
A scheme to blackmail me is on foot
Its rather a foolscheme if you ask me but it might have been a nuisance if it had been sprung on us unawares
It happened however that I twigged this scheme about two hours ago
It was the damnedest bit of luck you ever heard of You dont have luck put in Semple appreciatively
Other men have luck
You have something elseI dont give it a name
Thorpe smiled upon him and went on
I twigged it anyway
I went out and I drove the biggest kind of spike through that foolschemeplumb through its heart
Tomorrow a certain man will come to meoh I could almost tell you the kind of necktie hell wearand hell put up his bluff to me and Ill hear him outand thenthen Ill let the floor drop out from under him
Aye
said Semple with relish
Stay and dine with me tonight Thorpe impulsively suggested and well go to some Music Hall afterward
Theres a knockabout pantomime outfit at the CanterburyMartinetti I think the name isthats damned good
You get plenty of laugh and no tiresome blab to listen to
The older I get the more I think of people that keep their mouths shut
Aye observed Semple again
CHAPTER XX IN the Board Room next day Thorpe awaited the coming of Lord Plowden with the serene confidence of a prophet who not only knows that he is inspired but has had an illicit glimpse into the workings of the machinery of events
He sat motionless at his desk like a big spider for who time has no meaning
Before him lay two newspapers folded so as to expose paragraphs heavily indicated by blue pencilmarks
They were not financial journals and for that reason it was improbable that he would have seen these paragraphs if the Secretary of the Company had not marked them and brought them to him
That official had been vastly more fluttered by them than he found it possible to be
In slightlyvarying language these two items embedded in socalled money articles reported the rumour that a charge of fraud had arisen in connection with the Rubber Consols corner and that sensational disclosures were believed to be impending
Thorpe looked with a dulled abstracted eye at these papers lying on the desk and especially at the blue pencillines upon them as he pondered many things
Their statement thus scattered broadcast to the public seemed at once to introduce a new element into the situation and to leave it unchanged
That influence of some sort had been exerted to get this story into these papers it did not occur to him for an instant to doubt
To his view all things that were put into papers were put there for a purposeit would express his notion more clearly perhaps to say for a price
Of the methods of Fleet Street he was profoundly ignorant but his impressions of them were all cynical
Upon reflection however it seemed unlikely to him that Lord Plowden had secured the insertion of these rumours
So far as Thorpe could fathom that noblemans game its aims would not be served by premature publicity of this kind
Gradually the outlines of a more probable combination took shape in his thoughts
There were left in the grip of the corner now only two victimsRostocker and Aronson
They owed this invidious differentiation to a number of causes they had been the chief sellers of stock being between them responsible for the delivery of 8500 Rubber Consols shares which they could not get they were men of larger fortune than the other shorts and therefore could with safety be squeezed longest what was fortunate for him under the circumstances they were the two men against whom Thorpes personal grudge seemed able to maintain itself most easily
For these reasons they had already been mulcted in differences to the extent of in round numbers 165000 pounds
On the morrow the twelfth of September it was Thorpes plan to allow them to buy in the shares they needed at 22 or 23 pounds per sharewhich would take from them nearly 200000 pounds more
He had satisfied himself that they could and would if necessary pay this enormous ransom for their final escape from the corner
Partly because it was not so certain that they could pay more partly because he was satiated with spoils and tired of the strain of the business he had decided to permit this escape
He realized now however that they on their side had planned to escape without paying any final ransom at all
That was clearly the meaning of these paragraphs and of the representations which had yesterday been made to the Stock Exchange Committee
He had additional knowledge today of the character of these representations
Nothing definite had been alleged but some of the members of the Committee had been informally notified so Semple had this morning learned that a specific charge of fraud supported by unanswerable proof was to be brought against the Rubber Consols management on the morrow
Thorpe reasoned out now step by step what that meant
Lord Plowden had sought out Rostocker and Aronson and had told them that he had it in his power ignominiously to break the corner
He could hardly have told them the exact nature of his power because until he should have seen Tavender he did not himself know what it was
But he had given them to understand that he could prove fraud and they scenting in this the chance of saving 200000 pounds and seeing that time was so terribly short had hastened to the Committeemen with this vague declaration that on the morrow they could provethey did not precisely know what
Yesplainly enoughthat was what had happened
And it would be these two Jew wreckers eager to invest their speculative notification to the Committee with as much of an air of formality as possible who had caused the allusions to it to be published in these papers
Thorpes lustreless eye suddenly twinkled with mirth as he reached this conclusion his heavy face brightened into a grin of delight
A vision of Lord Plowdens absurd predicament rose vividly before him and he chuckled aloud at it
It seemed only the most natural thing in the world that at this instant a clerk should open the door and nod with meaning to the master
The visitor whom he had warned the people in the outer office he expected had arrived
Thorpe was still laughing to himself when Lord Plowden entered
Hallo
How dye do
he called out to him from where he sat at his desk
The hilarity of the manner into which he had been betrayed upon the instant surprised and rather confused him
He had not been altogether clear as to how he should receive Plowden but certainly a warm joviality had not occurred to him as appropriate
The nobleman was even more taken aback
He stared momentarily at the big mans beaming mask and then with nervous awkwardness executed a series of changes in his own facial expression and demeanour
He flushed red opened his lips to say Ah
and then twisted them into a doubting and seemingly painful smile
He looked with very brighteyed intentness at Thorpe as he advanced and somewhat spasmodically put out his hand
It occurred to Thorpe not to see this hand
How are you
he repeated in a more mechanical voice and withdrew his smile
Lord Plowden fidgeted on his feet for a brief embarrassed interval before the desk and then dropped into a chair at its side
With a deliberate effort at nonchalance he crossed his legs and caressed the ankle on his knee with a careless hand
Anything new
he asked
Thorpe lolled back in his armchair
Im going to be able to get away in a few days time he said indifferently
I expect to finally wind up the business on the Stock Exchange tomorrow
Ahyes commented Plowden vacantly
He seemed to be searching after thoughts which had wandered astray
Yesof course
Yesof course Thorpe said after him with a latent touch of significance
The other looked up quickly then glanced away again
Its all going as you expected is it
he asked
Better than I expected Thorpe told him energetically
Much better than anybody expected
Hah
said Plowden
After a moments reflection he went on hesitatingly I didnt know
I saw something in one of the papers this morningone of the money articleswhich spoke as if there were some doubt about the result
Thats why I called
Wellits damned good of you to come round and show such a friendly interest
Thorpes voice seemed candid enough but there was an enigmatic something in his glance which aroused the others distrust
Im afraid you dont take very much stock in the friendly interest he said with a constrained little laugh
Im not taking stock in anything new just now replied Thorpe lending himself lazily to the others metaphor
Im loaded up to the gunnels already
A minute of rather oppressive silence ensued
Then Plowden ventured upon an opening
All the same it WAS with an idea ofperhaps being of use to you that I came here he affirmed
In what way
Thorpe put the query almost listlessly
Lord Plowden turned his hands and let his dark eyes sparkle in a gesture of amiable uncertainty
That depended upon what was needed
I got the impression that you were in troublethe paper spoke as if there were no doubt of itand I imagined that quite probably you would be glad to talk with me about it
Quite right said Thorpe
So I should
This comprehensive assurance seemed not however to facilitate conversation
The nobleman looked at the pattern of the sock on the ankle he was nursing and knitted his brows in perplexity
What if the Committee of the Stock Exchange decide to interfere
he asked at last
Oh that would knock me skyhigh Thorpe admitted
Approximately how much may one take skyhigh to mean
Thorpe appeared to calculate
Almost anything up to a quarter of a million he answered
Hah
said Lord Plowden again
WellI understand Im given to understandthat very likely that is what the Committee will decide
Does it say that in the papers
asked Thorpe
He essayed an effect of concern
Where did you see that
I didnt see it the other explained
Itit came to me
God
said Thorpe
Thatll be awful
But are you really in earnest
Is that what you hear
And does it come at all straight
Lord Plowden nodded portentously
Absolutely straight he said with gravity
Thorpe after a momentary stare of what looked like bewilderment was seen to clutch at a straw
But what was it you were saying
he demanded with eagerness
You talked about helpa minute ago
Did you mean it
Have you got a plan
Is there something that you can do
Plowden weighed his words
It would be necessary to have a very complete understanding he remarked
Whatever you like exclaimed the other
Pardon meit would have to be a good deal more definite than that Plowden declared
A burnt childyou know
The big man tapped musingly with his fingernails on the desk
We wont quarrel about that he said
But what Id like to know firstyou neednt give anything away that you dont want tobut whats your plan
You say that theyve got me in a hole and that you can get me out
In effectyes
But how do you know that I cant get myself out
What do you know about the whole thing anyway
Supposing I tell you that I laugh at itthat theres no more ground for raising the suspicion of fraud than there is forfor suspecting that youve got wings and can fly
II dont think youll tell me that said Plowden placidly
Well then supposing I dont tell you that the other resumed argumentatively
Supposing I say instead that it cant be proved
If the Committee doesnt have proof NOWwithin twentyone or twentytwo hours they cant do anything at ail
Tomorrow is settling day
All along Ive said I would wind up the thing tomorrow
The marketprice has been made for me by the jobbers yesterday and today
Im all ready to end the whole business tomorrowclose it all out
And after thats done what do I care about the Stock Exchange Committee
They can investigate and be damned
What could they do to me
I think a man can always be arrested and indicted and sent to penal servitude said Lord Plowden with a certain solemnity of tone
There are even wellknown instances of extradition
Thorpe buried his chin deep in his collar and regarded his companion with a fixed gaze in which the latter detected signs of trepidation
But about the Committeeand tomorrow he said slowly
What do you say about that
How can they act in that lightning fashion
And even if proofs could be got how do you suppose they are to be got on the drop of the hat at a minutes notice
The case is of sufficient importance to warrant a special meeting tomorrow morning the other rejoined
One hours notice posted in the House is sufficient I believe
Any three members of the Committee can call such a meeting and I understand that seven make a quorum
You will see that a meeting could be held at noon tomorrow and within half an hour could make you a ruined man
I dont knowwould you call it quite ruined
commented Thorpe
I should still have a few sovereigns to go on with
A criminal prosecution would be practically inevitableafter such a disclosure Plowden reminded him with augmented severity of tone
Dont mix the two things up the other urged
There seemed to the listener to be supplication in the voice
Its the action of the Committee that you said you could influence
Thats what we were talking about
You say there will be a special meeting at noon tomorrow I said there could be one Plowden corrected him
All right
There CAN be one
And do you say that there can be proofproof against me of fraudproduced at that meeting
YesI say that the nobleman affirmed quietly
And further stilldo you say that it rests with you whether that proof shall be produced or not
Lord Plowden looked into the impassive deepeyed gaze which covered him and looked away from it again
I havent put it in just that form he said hesitatingly
But in essentialsyes that may be taken as true
And what is your figure
How much do you want for holding this proof of yours back and letting me finish scooping the money of your Hebrew friends Aronson and Rostocker
The peer raised his head and shot a keenly enquiring glance at the other
Are they my friends
he asked with challenging insolence
Im bound to assume that you have been dealing with them just as you are dealing with me
Thorpe explained his meaning dispassionately as if the transaction were entirely commonplace
You tell them that youre in a position to produce proof against me and ask them what theyll give for it
Then naturally enough you come to me and ask what Ill be willing to pay to have the proof suppressed
I quite understand that I must bid against these menand of course I take it for granted that since you know their figure youve arranged in your mind what mine is to be
I quite understand too that I am to pay more than they have offered
That is on account of friendly interest
Since you allude to it Lord Plowden observed with a certain calm loftiness of tone there is no harm in saying that you WILL pay something on that old score
Once you thrust the promise of something like a hundred thousand pounds positively upon me
You insisted on my believing it and I did so like a fool
I came to you to redeem the promise and you laughed in my face
Very well
It is my turn now
I hold the whiphand and I should be an ass not to remember things
I shall want that entire one hundred thousand pounds from you and fifty thousand added to it on account of the friendly interest as you so intelligently expressed it
Thorpes chin burrowed still deeper upon his breast
Its an outrage he said with feeling
Then he added in tones of dejected resignation When will you want it
At the moment when the payments of Rostocker and Aronson are made to you or to your bankers or agents Lord Plowden replied with prepared facility
He had evidently given much thought to this part of the proceedings
And of course I shall expect you to draw up now an agreement to that effect
I happen to have a stamped paper with me this time
And if you dont mind we will have it properly witnessed this time
Thorpe looked at him with a disconcertingly leaden stare the while he thought over what had been proposed
Thats right enough he announced at last but I shall expect you to do some writing too
Since were dealing on this basis there must be no doubt about the guarantee that you will perform your part of the contract
The performance itself since payment is conditional upon it began Plowden but the other interrupted him
No I want something better than that
Heregive me your stamped paper
He took the bluish sheet and without hesitation wrote several lines rapidly
Herethis is my promise he said to pay you 150000 pounds upon your satisfactory performance of a certain undertaking to be separately nominated in a document called A which we will jointly draw up and agree to and sign and deposit wherever you likefor safe keeping
Now if youll sit here and write out for me a similar thingthat in consideration of my promise of 150000 pounds you covenant to perform the undertaking to be nominated in the document Aand so on
Lord Plowden treated as a matter of course the ready and businesslike suggestion of the other
Taking his place at the desk in turn he wrote out what had been suggested
Thorpe touched a bell and the clerk who came in perfunctorily attested the signatures upon both papers
Each principal folded and pocketed the pledge of the other
Now said Thorpe when he had seated himself again at the desk we are all right so far as protection against each other goes
If you dont mind I will draw up a suggestion of what the separate document A should set forth
If you dont like it you can write one
He took more time to this task frowning laboriously over the fresh sheet of foolscap and screening from observation with his hand what he was writing
Finally the task seemed finished to his mind
He took up the paper glanced through it once more and handed it in silence to the other
In silence also and with an expression of arrested attention Lord Plowden read these lines The undertaking referred to in the two documents of even date signed respectively by Lord Plowden and Stormont Thorpe is to the effect that at some hour between eleven AM and three PM of September 12th instant Lord Plowden shall produce before a special meeting of the Committee of the Stock Exchange the person of one Jerome P Tavender to explain to said Committee his share in the blackmailing scheme of which Lord Plowden over his own signature has furnished documentary evidence
The nobleman continued to look down at the paper after the power to hold it without shaking had left his hand
There came into his face mingling with and vitiating its rich natural hues of health a kind of grey shadow
It was as if clay was revealing itself beneath faded paint
He did not lift his eyes
Thorpe had been prepared to hail this consummation of his trick with boisterous and scornful mirth
Even while the victim was deciphering the fatal paper he had restrained with impatience the desire to burst out into bitter laughter
But now there was something in the aspect of Plowdens collapse which seemed to forbid triumphant derision
He was taking his blow so like a gentlemanashenpale and quivering but clinging to a highbred dignity of silencethat the impulse to exhibit equally good manners possessed Thorpe upon the instant
Wellyou see how little business youve got setting yourself to buck against a grownup man
He offered the observation in the tone of the school teacher affectedly philosophical but secretly jubilant who harangues a defeated and humiliated urchin upon his folly
Oh chuck it
growled Lord Plowden staring still at the calamitous paper
Thorpe accepted in good part the intimation that silence was after all most decorous
He put his feet up on the corner of the desk and tipping back his chair surveyed the discomfited Viscount impassively
He forbore even to smile
So this swine of a Tavender came straight to you
Lord Plowden had found words at last
As he spoke he lifted his face and made a show of looking the other in the eye
Oh there are a hundred things in your own game even that you havent an inkling of Thorpe told him lightly
Ive been watching every move youve made seeing further ahead in your own game than you did
Why it was too easy
It was like playing draughts with a girl
I knew you would come today for example
I told the people out there that I expected you
Yess said the other with rueful bewilderment
You seem to have been rather on the spotI confess
On the spot
All over the place
Thorpe lifted himself slightly in his chair and put more animation into his voice
Its the mistake you people make
he declared oracularly
You think that a man can come into the City without a penny and form great combinations and carry through a great scheme and wage a fight with the smartest set of scoundrels on the London Stock Exchange and beat em and make for himself a big fortuneand still be a fool
You imagine that a man like that can be played with and hoodwinked by amateurs like yourself
Its too ridiculous
The perception that apparently Thorpe bore little or no malice had begun to spread through Plowdens consciousness
It was almost more surprising to him than the revelation of his failure had been
He accustomed himself to the thought gradually and as he did so the courage crept back into his glance
He breathed more easily
You are right
he admitted
It cost him nothing to give a maximum of fervid conviction to the tone of his words
The big brutes pride in his own brains and power was still his weakest point
You are right
I did play the fool
And it was all the more stupid because I was the first man in London to recognize the immense forces in you
I said to you at the very outset You are going to go far
You are going to be a great man
You remember that dont you
Thorpe nodded
YesI remember it
The nobleman upon reflection drew a little silver box from his pocket and extracted a match
Do you mind
he asked and scarcely waiting for a token of reply struck a flame upon the sole of his shoe and applied it to the sheet of foolscap he still held in his hand
The two men watched it curl and blacken after it had been tossed in the grate without a word
This incident had the effect of recalling to Thorpe the essentials of the situation
He had allowed the talk to drift to a point where it became almost affable
He sat upright with a sudden determination and put his feet firmly on the floor and knitted his brows in austerity
It was not only a dirty trick that you tried to play me he said in an altered harsh tone but it was a fooltrick
That drunken old bum of a Tavender writes some lunatic nonsense or other to Gafferson and hes a worse idiot even than Tavender is and on the strength of what one of these clowns thinks he surmises the other clown means you go and spend your moneymoney I gave you by the wayin bringing Tavender over here
You do this on the double chance well say of using him against me for revenge and profit combined or of peddling him to me for a still bigger profit
You see its all at my fingers ends
Lord Plowden nodded an unqualified assent
Well thenTavender arrives
What do you do
Are you at the wharf to meet him
Have you said to yourself Ive set out to fight one of the smartest and strongest men in England and Ive got to keep every atom of wits about me and strain every nerve to the utmost and watch every point of the game as a tiger watches a snake
Not a bit of it
You snooze in bed and you send GaffersonGaffersonthe mudhead of the earth
to meet your Tavender and loaf about with him in London and bring him down by a slow train to your place in the evening
My God
Youve only got two clear days left to do the whole thing inand you dont even come up to town to get ready for them
You send Gaffersonand he goes off to see a flowershow Mother of Moses
think of it
a FLOWERshowand your Tavender aud I are left to take a stroll together and talk over old times and arrange about new times and so on to our hearts content
Really its too easy
You make me tired
The nobleman offered a wan appealing shadow of a smile
I confess to a certain degree of weariness myself he said humbly
Thorpe looked at him in his old apathetic leaden fashion for a little
I may tell you that if you HAD got hold of Tavender he decided to tell him he shouldnt have been of the faintest use to you
I know what it was that he wrote to GaffersonI couldnt understand it when he first told me but afterwards I saw through itand it was merely a maudlin misapprehension of his
Hed got three or four things all mixed up together
Youve never met your friend Tavender I believe
Youd enjoy him at Hadlow House
He smells of rum a hundred yards off
What little brain hes got left is soaked in it
The first time I was ever camping with him I had to lick him for drinking the methylated spirits we were using with our tin stove
Oh youd have liked him
Evidently said Lord Plowden upon reflection it was all a most unfortunate andahmost deplorable mistake
With inspiration he made bold to add The most amazing thing thoughto my mindis that you dont seemwhat shall I sayparticularly enraged with me about it
Yesthat surprises me too Thorpe meditatively admitted
I was entitled to kill youcrush you to jelly
Any other man I would
But youI dont knowI do funny things with you
I wish you would give me a drink nowas one of them Plowden ventured to suggest with uneasy pleasantry
Thorpe smiled a little as he rose and heavily moved across the room
He set out upon the big official table in the middle that mockingly pretentious reminder of a Board which never met a decanter and two glasses and some recumbent roundbottomed bottles
He handed one of these last to Plowden as the latter strolled toward the table
You know how to open these dont you
he said languidly
Somehow I never could manage it
The nobleman submissively took the bottle and picked with awkwardness at its wire and cork and all at once achieved a premature and not oversuccessful explosion
He wiped his dripping cuff in silence when the tumblers were supplied
Wellheres better luck to you next time Thorpe said lifting his glass
The audacious irony of his words filled Plowden with an instant purpose
What on earth did you round on me in that way for Thorpewhen I was here last
He put the question with bravery enough but at sight of the others unresponsive face grew suddenly timorous aud explanatory
No man was ever more astounded in the world than I was
To this day Im as unable to account for it as a babe unborn
What conceivable thing had I done to you
Thorpe slowly thought of something that had not occurred to him before and seized upon it with a certain satisfaction
That day that you took me shooting he said with the tone of one finally exposing a longnursed grievance you stayed in bed for hours after you knew I was up and waiting for youand when we went out you had a servant to carry a chair for you but Iby GodI had to stand up
Heavens above
ejaculated Plowden in unfeigned amazement
These are little thingsmere trifles continued Thorpe dogmatically but with men of my temper and makeup those are just the things that aggravate and rankle and hurt
Maybe its foolish but thats the kind of man I am
You ought to have had the intelligence to see thatand not let these stupid little things happen to annoy me
Why just think what you did
I was going to do God knows what for youmake your fortune and everything elseand you didnt show consideration enough for me to get out of bed at a decent hourmuch less see to it that I had a chair if you were going to have one
Upon my word I cant tell how ashamed and sorry I am Lord Plowden assured him with fervent contrition in his voice
Well those are the things to guard against said Thorpe approaching a dismissal of the subject
People who show consideration for me people who take pains to do the little pleasant things for me and see that Im not annoyed and worried by triflestheyre the people that I on my side do the big things for
I can be the best friend in the world but only to those who show that they care for me and do what they know Ill like
I dont want toadies about me but I do want people who feel bound to me and are as keen about me and my feelings and interests as they are about their own
It is delightfully feudalall this commented the nobleman smilingly addressing the remark to nobody in particular
Then he looked at Thorpe
Let me be one of themone of the people you speak of he said with directness
Thorpe returned his look with the goodnatured beginnings of a grin
But what would you be good for
he queried in a bantering tone
People I have about me have to be of some use
They require to have heads on their shoulders
Whyjust think what youve done
I dont mean so much about your letting Tavender slip through your fingersalthough that was about the worst I ever heard of
But here in this room at that desk there you allowed me to bounce you into writing and signing a paper which you ought to have had your hand cut off rather than write much less sign
You come here trying to work the most difficult and dangerous kind of a bluffknowing all the while that the witness you depended entirely upon had disappeared you hadnt the remotest idea whereand you actually let me lead you into giving me your signature to your own declaration that you are blackmailing me
Thinking it all overyou knowI cant see that you would be of much help to me in the City
Lord Plowden joined perforce in the laughter with which the big man enjoyed his own pleasantry
His mirth had some superficial signs of shamefacedness but it was hopeful underneath
The City
he echoed with meaning
Thats the curse of it
What do I know about the City
What business have I in the City
As you said Im the amateur
A strong man like you can make me seem any kind of a ridiculous fool he likes with the turn of his hand
I see that right enough
But what am I to do
I have to make a shot at something
Im so rotten poor
Thorpe had retired again behind the barrier of dull eyed abstraction
He seemed not to have heard this appealing explanation
The other preserved silence in turn and even made a pretence of looking at some pamphlets on the table as a token of his boundless deference to the masters mood
I dont know
Ill see the big man muttered at last doubtfully
Lord Plowden felt warranted in taking an optimistic view of these vague words
Its awfully good of you he began lamely and then paused
I wonderhe took up a new thought with a more solicitous toneI wonder if you would mind returning to me that idiotic paper I signed
Thorpe shook his head
Not just now at any rate he said still musingly
With his head bowed he took a few restless steps
But you are going toto help me
the other remarked with an air of confidence
He had taken up his hat in response to the tacit warning of his companions manner
Thorpe looked at him curiously and hesitated over his answer
It was a surprising and almost unaccountable conclusion for the interview to have reached
He was in some vague way ashamed of himself but he was explicitly and contemptuously ashamed for Plowden and the impulse to say so was strong within him
This handsome young gentleman of title ought not to be escaping with this restored buoyancy of mien and this complacency of spirit
He had deserved to be punished with a heavy hand and here he was blithely making certain of new benefits instead
I dont knowIll see Thorpe moodily repeatedand there was no more to be said
CHAPTER XXI IN the noon hour of the following day was enacted the brief final scene in the drama of the Rubber Consols corner
For long weeks Mr Stormont Thorpe had given much thought to this approaching climax of his great adventurelooking forward to it both as the crowning event of his life and as the dawn of a new existence in some novel enchanted world
It was to bring his triumph and even more his release
It was at once to crown him as a hero and chieftain among City men and transfigure him into a being for whom all City things were an abomination
In his waking hours the conflict between these aims did not specially force itself upon his attention he mused upon and spun fancies about either one indifferently and they seemed not at all irreconcilable
But his dreams were full of warfarewearily saturated with strife and endless endeavour to do things which could not be done and panicstricken terrors before the shadow of shapeless calamitiesuntil he dreaded to go to sleep
Then he discovered that an extra two glasses of whiskeyandwater would solve that particular difficulty and send him into prompt leaden slumberbut the early mornings remained as torturing as ever
In the twilight he awoke oppressed and sick at heart with gloomand then dozed at intervals through fantastic new ordeals of anguish and shame and fear till it was decently possible to get up
Then indeed the big cold sponge on his head and spine scattered these foolish troubles like chaff and restored to him his citizenship among the realities
He dressed with returning equanimity and was almost cheerful by the time he thrust his razor into the hot water
Yet increasingly he was conscious of the wear and strain of it all and increasingly the date September twelfth loomed before him with a portentous individuality of its own
This day grew to mean so much more to him than had all the other days of the dead years together that he woke in the darkness of its opening hours and did not get satisfactorily to sleep again
His vigil however was for the once free from grief
He drowsily awaited the morning in vague mental comfort he had recurring haphazard indolent glimpses of a protecting fact standing guard just outside the portals of consciousnessthe fact that the great day was here
He rose early breakfasted well and walked by the Embankment to the City where at ten he had a few words with Semple and afterward caused himself to be denied to ordinary callers
He paced up and down the Board Room for the better part of the ensuing two hours luxuriating in the general sense of satisfaction in the proximity of the climax rather than pretending to himself that he was thinking out its details
He had provided in his plans of the day for a visit from Messrs Rostocker and Aronson which should constitute the dramatic finale of the corner and he looked forward to this meeting with a certain eagerness of expectation
Yet even here he thought broadly of the scene as a whole and asked himself no questions about words and phrases
It seemed to be taken for granted in his mind that the scene itself would be theatrically impressive even spectacular
In the event this longawaited culmination proved to be disappointingly flat and commonplace
It was over before Thorpe had said any considerable proportion of the things he saw afterward that he had intended to say
The two men came as he had expected they would and they bought their way out of the tragic corner at precisely the price he had nominated in his mind
But hardly anything else went as he had dimly prefigured it
Mr Rostocker was a yellowhaired man and Mr Aronson was as dark as a Moor and no physical resemblance of features or form suggested itself to the comparing eye yet Thorpe even now when they stood brusquely silent before him with their carefullybrushed hats pulled down over their eyes stuck to it in his own mind that it was hard to tell them apart
To the end there was something impersonal in his feeling toward them
They for their part coldly abstained from exhibiting a sign of feeling about him good bad or indifferent
It was the man with the fair hair and little curly flaxen beard who spoke How do you do
I understand that we can buy eight thousand five hundred Rubber Consols from you at twentythree
Notwentyfive replied Thorpe
The dark man spoke The jobbers price is twentythree
To carry overyes Thorpe answered
But to buy it is twentyfive
The two sons of the race which invented mental arithmetic exchanged an alert glance and looked at the floor for an engrossed instant
I dont mind telling you Thorpe interposed upon their silence I put on that extra two pounds because you got up that story about applying to the Stock Exchange Committee on a charge of fraud
We didnt get up any story said Rostocker curtly
You tried to plant it on us Aronson declared
One of your own Directors put it about
I thought it was a fake at the time
This view of the episode took Thorpe by surprise
As it seemed in passing to involve a compliment to his own strategic powers he accepted it without comment
Wellit is twentyfive anyway he told them with firmness
Twentyfour suggested Aronson after another momentary pause
Not a shilling less than twentyfive Thorpe insisted with quiet doggedness
We can always pay our creditors and let you whistle Rostocker reminded him laconically
You can do anything you like was the reply except buy Rubber Consols under twentyfive
It doesnt matter a fig to me whether you go bankrupt or not
It would suit me as well to have you two hammered as to take your money
Upon the spur of a sudden thought he drew out his watch
In just two minutes time to a tick the price will be thirty
Lets be hammered then
said Aronson to his companion with simulated impulsiveness
Rostocker was the older and stronger man and when at last he spoke it was with the decision of one in authority
It is your game he said with grave imperturbability
Eight thousand five hundred at twentyfive
Will you deliver at the Credit Lyonnais in half an hour
Thorpe nodded impassively
Then a roving idea of genial impertinence brought a gleam to his eye
If you should happen to want more Rubber Consols at any time he said with a tentative chuckle I could probably let you have them at a reduced price
The two received the pleasantry without a smile but to Thorpes astonishment one of them seemed to discern something in it beside banter
It was Rostocker who said Perhaps we may make a deal with you and apparently meant it
They went out at this ignoring ceremony upon their exit as stolidly as they had done upon their entrance and a moment later Thorpe called in the Secretary and despatched a messenger to bring Semple from Capel Court
The formalities of this final transfer of shares had been dictated to the former and he had gone off on the business before the Broker arrived
Thorpe stood waiting near the door and held out his hand with a dramatically significant gesture when the little Scotchman entered
Put her there
he exclaimed heartily with an exuberant reversion to the slang of remote transatlantic bonhomie
Yehve done it then
said Semple his sharp face softening with pleasure at the news
Yehve pulled it off at twentythree
The others big countenance yielded itself to a boyish grin
TwentyFIVE
he said and laughed aloud
After you left this morning it kind o occurred to me that Id raise it a couple of pounds
I found I was madder about those pieces in the newspapers than I thought I was and so I took an extra seventeen thousand pounds on that account
God above
Semple ejaculated with a satisfaction through which signs of an earlier fright were visible
It was touchandgo if you didnt lose it all by doing that
You risked everything man
Thorpe ponderously shrugged his shoulders
WellI did it anyhow and it came off was his comment
Then straightening himself he drew a long long breath and beamed down at the little man
Think of it
God
Its actually all over
And NOW perhaps we wont have a drink
Hell
Lets send out for some champagne
His finger was hovering over the bell when the Brokers dissuading voice arrested it
No no
Semple urged
I wouldnt touch it
Its no fit drink for the daytimeand its a scandal in an office
Your clerks will aye blab it about hither and yon and nothing harms a mans reputation more in the City
Oh to hell with the City
cried Thorpe joyously
Im never going to set foot in it again
Think of that
I mean it
None the less he abandoned the idea of sending out for wine and contented himself with the resources of the cabinet instead
After some friendly pressure Semple consented to join him in a brandyandsoda though he continued to protest between sips that at such an hour it was an indecent practice
Its the ruin of many a strong man he moralized looking rather pointedly at Thorpe over his glass
Its the principal danger that besets the verra successful man
Hes too busily occupied to take exercise and hes too anxious and worried to get his proper sleepbut he can always drink
In one sense Im not sorry to think that youre leaving the City
Oh it never hurts me Thorpe said indifferently accepting the direction of the homily
Im as strong as an ox
But all the same I shall be better in every way for getting out of this hole
Thank God I can get off to Scotland tomorrow
But I say Semple whats the matter with your visiting me at my place there
Ill give you the greatest shooting and fishing you ever heard of
The Broker was thinking of something else
What is to be the precise position of the Company in the immediate future
he asked
Company
What Company
Semple smiled grimly
Have you already forgotten that there is such a thing
he queried with irony
Why man this Company that paid for this verra fine Boardtable he explained with his knuckles on its red baize centre
Thorpe laughed amusedly
I paid for that out of my own pocket he said
For that matter everything about the Company has come out of my pocket Or gone into it suggested the other and they chuckled together
But noyoure right Thorpe declared
Some thing ought to be settled about the Company I suppose
Of course I wash my hands of itbut would anybody else want to go on with it
You see its annual working expenses merely for the office and the Board foot up nearly 3000 pounds
Ive paid these for this year but naturally I wont do it again
And would it be worth anybody elses while to do it
Yours for example
Have you had any explanations with the other Directors
the Broker asked thoughtfully
Explanationsno Thorpe told him
But thats all right
The Marquis has been taken care of and so has Plowden
Theyre game to agree to anything
And lets seeKervick is entirely my man
That leaves Watkin and Davidsonand they dont matter
Theyre mere guineapigs
A few hundreds apiece would shut them up if you thought it was worth while to give them anything at all
And about the propertythe rubber plantationthat the Company was formed to acquire and develop
I suppose there really is such a plantation
Oh yes its all there right enough Thorpe said briefly
Its no good though is it
the Broker asked with affable directness
Between ourselves it isnt worth a damn the other blithely assured him
The Scotchman mused with bent brows
There ought still to be money in it he said with an air of conviction
By the way it occurred to Thorpe to mention heres something I didnt understand
I told Rostocker here just as a cheeky kind of joke that after he and Aronson had got their eight thousand five hundred if they thought theyd like still more shares Id let em have em at a bargainand he seemed to take it seriously
He did for a fact
Said perhaps he could make a deal with me
Hmm
said Semple reflectively
Ill see if he says anything to me
Very likely hes spotted some way of taking the thing over and reorganizing it and giving it another run over the course
Ill think it out
And now I must be off
Arent you lunching
NoIll have the boy bring in some sandwiches Thorpe decided
I want my next meal west of Temple Bar when I get round to it
Ive soured on the City for keeps
I wouldnt say that it had been so bad to you either Semple smilingly suggested as he turned to the door
Thorpe grinned in satisfied comment
Hurry back as soon as youve finally settled with Rostocker and the other fellow he called after him and began pacing the floor again
It was nearly four oclock when these two men again together in the Board Room and having finished the inspection of some papers on the desk sat upright and looked at each other in tacit recognition that final words were to be spoken
Well Semple Thorpe began after that significant little pause I want to say that Im damned glad youve done so well for yourself in this affair
Youve been as straight as a die to meI owe it as much to you as I do to myselfand if you dont think youve got enough even now I want you to say so
He had spoken in tones of sincere liking and the other answered him in kind
I have more than I ever dreamed of making in a lifetime when I came to London he declared
If my father were alive and heard me tell him that in one year out of a single transaction I had cleared over sixtyfive thousand pounds hed be fit to doubt the existence of a Supreme Being
Im obliged to you for your good words Thorpe
Its not only been profitable to work with you but it has been a great education and a great pleasure as well
Thorpe nodded his appreciation
Im going to ask a favour of you he said
I want to leave the general run of my investments and interests here in your hands to keep track of I dont want to speculate at all in the ordinary meaning of the word
Even after I bury a pot of money in nonproductive real estate I shall have an income of 50000 pounds at the very least and perhaps twice as much
Theres no fun in gambling when youve got such a bank as that behind you
But if there are good wise changes to be made in investments or if things turn up in the way of chances that I ought to know about I want to feel that youre on the spot watching things and doing things in my interest
And as it wont be regular brokers work I shall want to pay you a stated sumwhatever you think is right
That will arrange itself easily enough said Semple
I shall have the greatest pleasure in caring for whatever you put in my hands
And I think I can promise that it will be none the worse for the keeping
I dont need any assurance on that score Thorpe declared cordially
Youre the one sterling honest man Ive known in the City
It was the Brokers turn to make a little acknowledging bow
His eyes gleamed frank satisfaction at being so well understood
I think I see the way that more money can be made out of the Company he said abruptly changing the subject
Ive had but a few words with Rostocker about itbut its clear to me that he has a plan
He will be coming to you with a proposition
Well he wont find me then interposed Thorpe with a comfortable smile
I leave all that to you
I suspect that his plan continued Semple is to make a subrosa offer of a few shillings for the majority of the shares and reconstitute the Board and then form another Company to buy the property and goodwill of the old one at a handsome price
Now if that would be a good thing for him to do it would be a good thing for me to do
I shall go over it all carefully in detail this evening
And I suppose if I see my way clear before me than I may rely upon your good feeling in the matter
I would do all the work and assume all the risk and let us say divide any profits equallyyou in turn giving me a free hand with all your shares and your influence with the Directors
Ill do better still Thorpe told him upon brief reflection
Reconstitute the Board and make Lord Plowden ChairmanI dont imagine the Marquis would have the nerve to go on with itand Ill make a free gift of my shares to you twohalf and half
Youll find him all right to work withif you can only get him up in the morningand Ive kind o promised him something of the sort
Does that suit you
Semples countenance was thoughtful rather than enthusiastic
Im more skeptical about Lords than you are he observed but if hes amenable and understands that his part is to do what I tell him to do Ive no doubt we shall hit it off together
Oh absolutely
said Thorpe with confidence
Ill see to it that he behaves like a lamb
Youre to have an absolutely free hand
Youre to do what you like wind the Company up or sell it out or rig it up under a new name and catch a new set of gudgeons with it whatever you damned please
When I trust a man I trust him
The two friends their faces brightened and their voices mellowed by this serene consciousness of their mutual trust in each others loyalty and integrity dwelt no further upon these halcyon beginnings of a fresh plan for plundering the public
They spoke instead on personal topicsof the possibility of Semples coming to Scotland during the autumn and of the chance of Thorpes wintering abroad
All at once Thorpe found himself disclosing the fact of his forthcoming marriage though he did not mention the name of the ladys father and under the gracious stress of this announcement they drank again and clinked glasses fervently
When Semple at last took his leave they shook hands with the deepeyed earnestness of comrades who have been through battle and faced death together
It was not until Thorpe stood alone that the full realizing sense of what the day meant seemed to come to him
Fruition was finally complete the last winnowing of the great harvest had been added to the pile
Positively nothing remained for him but to enter and enjoy
He found it curiously difficult to grasp the thought in its entirety
He stood the master of unlimited leisure for the rest of his life and of power to enrich that life with everything that money could buybut there was an odd inability to feel about it as he knew he ought to feel
Somehow for some unaccountable reason an absurd depression hovered about over his mind darkening it with formless shadows
It was as if he were sorry that the work was all finishedthat there was nothing more for him to do
But that was too foolish and he tried to thrust it from him
He said with angry decision to himself that he had never liked the work that it had all been unpleasant and grinding drudgery tolerable only as a means to an end that now this end had been reached he wanted never to lay eyes on the City again
Let him dwell instead upon the things he did want to lay eyes upon
Some travel no doubt he would like but not too much certainly no more than his wife would cheerfully accept as a minimum
He desired rather to rest among his own possessions
To be lord of the manor at Pellesley Court with his own retinue of servants and dependents and tenants his own thousands of rich acres his own splendid old timber his own fat stock and fleet horses and abundant covers and prize kennelsTHAT was what most truly appealed to him
It was not at all certain that he would hunt breakneck adventure in the saddle scarcely attracted him
But there was no reason in the world why he should not breed racing horses and create for himself a distinguished and even lofty position on the Turf
He had never cared much about races or racing folk himself but when the Prince and Lord Rosebery and people like that went in for winning the Derby there clearly must be something fascinating in it
Then Parliament of course he did not waver at all from his old if vague conception of a seat in Parliament as a natural part of the outfit of a powerful country magnate
And in a hundred other ways men should think of him as powerful and look up to him
He would go to church every Sunday and sit in the big Squires pew
He would be a magistrate as a matter of course and he would make himself felt on the County Council
He would astonish the county by his charities and in bad years by the munificence of his reductions in rents
Perhaps if there were a particularly bad harvest he would decline all over his estate to exact any rent whatever
Fancy what a noble sensation that would make
A Duke could do no more
It was very clear to him now that he desired to have children of his ownsay two at least a son and a daughter or perhaps a son and two daughters two little girls would be company for each other
As he prefigured these new beings the son was to exist chiefly for purposes of distinction and the dignity of heirship and the paternal relations with him would be always somewhat formal and though affectionate unexpansive
But the little girlsthey would put their arms round their fathers neck and walk out with him to see the pigs and the dogs and be the darlings of his heart
He would be an old man by the time they grew up
A beatific vision of himself took form in his mindof himself growing grey and pleasurably tired surrounded by opulence and the demonstrative respect of everybody smiling with virtuous content as he strolled along between his two daughters miracles of beauty and tenderness holding each by a hand
The entrance of a clerk broke abruptly upon this daydream
He had a telegram in his hand and Thorpe rousing himself with an effort took the livercoloured envelope and looked blankly at it
Some weird apprehension seized upon him as if he belonged to the peasant class which instinctively yokes telegrams and calamities together
He deferred to this feeling enough to nod dismissal to the clerk and then when he was again alone slowly opened the message and read it NewcastleonTyne September 12
Our friend died at Edinboro this morning
See you at hotel this eveningKervick
What Thorpe felt at first was that his two daughters had shrunk from him with swift terrible aversion they vanished along with every phase of the bright vision under a pall of unearthly blackness
He stood in the centre of a chill solitude staring stupidly at the coarse soft paper
The premonition then had justified itself
Something had told him that the telegram was an evil thing
A vaguely superstitious consciousness of being in the presence of Fate laid hold upon him
His great day of triumph had its bloodstain
A victim had been needfuland to that end poor simple silly old Tavender was a dead man
Thorpe could see himan embarrassing cadaver eyed by strangers who did not know what to do with itfatuous even in death
A sudden rage at Kervick flamed up
He clearly had played the foolclumsily overplying the simpleton with drink till he had killed him
The shadow of murder indubitably hung over the thing
And thenthe crass witlessness of telegraphing
Already doubtless the police of Edinborough were talking over the wires with Scotland Yard
A reference to a death in Edinborough in a telegram from Newcastleit was incredible that this should escape the eye of the authorities
Any minute might bring a detective through that door therefollowing into the Board Room with his implacable scent the clue of blood
Thorpes fancy pictured this detective as a momentarily actual presencetall lean coldeyed mysteriously calm and fatally wise the omniscient terror of the magazine shortstories
He turned faint and sick under a spasm of fright
The menace of enquiry became something more than a threat he felt it like the grip of a constable upon his arm
Everything would be mercilessly unravelled
The telegram of the idiot Kervick would bring the police down upon him like a pack of beagles
The beliefs and surmises of the idiot Gafferson would furnish them with the key to everything
He would have his letter from Tavender to show to the detectivesand the Governments smart lawyers would ferret out the rest
The death of Tavenderthey could hardly make him responsible for that but it was the dramatic feature of this death which would inspire them all to dig up everything about the fraud
It was this same sensational added element of the death too which would count with a jury
They were always gross sentimental fools these juries
They would mix up the death and the deal in Rubber Consols and in their fatheaded confusion would say Penal Servitudefourteen years
Or no it was the Judge who fixed that
But the Judges were fools too they were too conceited too puffed up with vanity to take the trouble to understand
He groaned aloud in a nightmare of helplessness
The sound of his own voice moaning in his ears had a magical effect upon him
He lifted his head gazed about him and then flushed deeply
His nerveless cowardice had all at once become unbelievable to himself
With a shamed frown he straightened himself and stood thus for a long minute engrossed in the definite task of chasing these phantoms from his mind
Once a manly front was displayed to them they slunk away with miraculous facility
He poured out some brandy and sipped it neat and laughed scornfully defiantly aloud
He had over half a millionwith power and force and courage enough to do with it what he liked
He had fought luck undauntedly unwearyingly during all those years when his hands were empty
Was he to tremble and turn tail now when his hands were full when he was armoured and weaponed at every point
He was amazed and hurt and still more enraged at that fit of girlish weakness which had possessed him
He could have beaten himself with stripes for it
But it could never happen againnever never
He told himself that with proud resolute reiteration as he got his hat and stick and put in his pockets one or two papers from the desk and then glanced about the Board Room for what was most likely the last time
Here he had won his great victory over Fate here he had put his enemies under his feet and if innocent simpletons had wandered into the company of these foes it mattered not a whit to him that they also had been crushed
Figuratively he turned his back upon them now he left them slain and trampled in the Board Room behind him
They no longer concerned him
Figuratively too as he walked with firmness to the door he stepped over the body of old Tavender upon the threshold and bestowed upon it a downward mental glance and passed on
By the time he reached the street the memory of Tavender had become the merest shred of a myth
As he strode on it seemed to him that his daughters came again and took his hands and moved lovingly beside himlovingly and still more admiringly than before
CHAPTER XXII BY the autumn of the following year a certain small proportion of the people inhabiting the district in Hertfordshire which set its clocks by the dial over the stabletower of Pellesley Court had accustomed themselves to give the place its new name of High Thorpe
These were for the most part the folk of peculiarly facile wits and ready powers of adaptation like pushing small tradesmen and the upper servants in county houses
An indolent and hazy compromise upon Pellesley Thorpe had drifted into use by perhaps a larger number
To the puzzled conservatism of the abiding huge majority nearest to the soilthe roundbacked lumpish men who tie strings round their corduroys under the knee and the strong cowfaced women who look at passersby on the road from the doors of dark little cottages over radiant patches of blossoming gardenit seemed safest to drop family names altogether and call it merely the Court
It stood proudly upon what was rather a notable elevation for those flat partsa massive mansion of simple form built of a grey stone which seemed at a distance almost white against the deep background of yews and Italian pines behind it
For many miles seaward this pale front was a landmark
From the terracewalk at its base one beheld a great expanse of soft green country sloping gently away for a long distance then stretching out upon a level which on misty days was interminable
In bright weather the remote lowlying horizon had a defining line of brownishblueand this stood for what was left of a primitive forest containing trees much older than the Norman name it bore
It was a forest which at some time no doubt had extended without a break till it merged into that of Eppingleagues away to the south
The modern clearance and tillage however which separated it now from Epping had served as a curiously effective barriermore baffling than the Romans and Angles in their turn had found the original wildwood
No stranger seemed ever to find his way into that broad minutelycultivated fertile plain which High Thorpe looked down upon
No railway had pushed its cheapening course across it
Silent embowered old country roads and lanes netted its expanse with hedgerows red points of tiled roofs distinguishable here and there in clusters among the darker greens of orchards identified the scattered hamletsall named in Domesday Book all seemingly unchanged since
A grey square churchtower emerging from the rooks nests an ordered mass of foliage sheltering the distant gables and chimneys of some isolated house the dim perception on occasion that a rustic waggon was in motion on some highway crawling patiently like an insectof this placid inductive nature were all the added proofs of human occupation that the landscape offered
Mr Stormont Thorpe on an afternoon of early October yawned in the face of this landscapeand then idly wondered a little at the mood which had impelled him to do so
At the outset of his proprietorship he had bound himself as by a point of honour to regard this as the finest view from any gentlemans house in England
During the first few months his fidelity had been taxed a good deal but these temptations and struggles lay now all happily behind him
He had satisfactorily assimilated the spirit of the vista and blended it with his own
Its inertia when one came to comprehend it was undeniably magnificent and long ago he had perceived within himself the growth of an answering repose a responsive lethargy which in its full development was also going to be very fine
Practically all the land this side of the impalpable line where trees and houses began to fade into the background belonged to him there were whole villages nestling halfconcealed under its shrubberies which were his property
As an investment these possessions were extremely unremunerative
Indeed if one added the cost of the improvements which ought to be made to the expenditure already laid out in renovations it was questionable if for the next twenty years they would not represent a deficit on the incomesheet
But now that he had laid hold of the local character it pleased him that it should be so
He would not for the world have his gentle woollyminded unprofitable cottagers transformed into hustlers it would wound his eye to see the smoke of any commercial chimney the smudge of any dividendpaying factory staining the pure tints of the sylvan landscape
He had truly learned to love it
Yet now as he strolled on the terrace with his first afterluncheon cigar he unaccountably yawned at the thing he loved
Upon reflection he had gone to bed rather earlier the previous evening than usual
He had not been drinking out of the ordinary his liver seemed right enough
He was not conscious of being either tired or drowsy
He looked again at the view with some fixity and said to himself convincingly that nothing else in England could compare with it
It was the finest thing there was anywhere
Then he surprised himself in the middle of another yawnand halted abruptly
It occurred to him that he wanted to travel
Since his homecoming to this splendid new home in the previous January at the conclusion of a honeymoon spent in Algiers and Egypt he had not been out of England
There had been a considerable sojourn in London it is true at what was described to him as the height of the Season but looking back upon it he could not think of it as a diversion
It had been a restless overworked mystifying experience full of dinners to people whom he had never seen before and laborious encounters with other people whom he did not particularly want to see again
There had been no physical comfort in it for him and little more mental satisfaction for Londoners or rather people in London seemed all to be making an invidious distinction in their minds between him and his wife
The fact that she continued to be called Lady Cressage was not of itself important to him
But in the incessant going about in London their names were called out together so often that his ear grew sensitive and sore to the touch of the footmens reverberations
The meaning differentiation which the voices of the servants insisted upon seemed inevitably reflected in the glance and manner of their mistresses
More than anything else that made him hate London and barred the doors of his mind to all thoughts of buying a townhouse
His newlymade wife it is true had not cared much for London either and had agreed to his decision against a townhouse almost with animation
The occasion of their return from the hot bustle of the metropolis to these cool home shadesin particular the minute in which at a bend in the winding carriageway down below they had silently regarded together the spectacle uplifted before them with the big welcoming house and the servants on the terracehad a place of its own in his memory
Edith had pressed his arm as they sat side by side in the landau on the instant compulsion of a feeling they had in common
He had never before or since had quite the same assurance that she shared an emotion with him
He was very far however from finding fault with his wife
It was in the nature of the life he chose to lead that he should see a great deal of her and think a great deal about her and she bore both tests admirably
If there was a fault to be found it was with himself for his inability to altogether understand her
She played the part she had undertaken to play with abundant skill and discretion and grace and even with an air of nice goodfellowship which had some of the aspects of affection
He was vaguely annoyed with himself for having insight enough to perceive that it was a part she was playing and yet lacking the added shrewdness to divine what her own personal attitude to her role was like
He had noticed sometimes the way good women looked at their husbands when the latter were talking over their headswith the eager intent noncomprehending admiration of an affectionate dog
This was a look which he could not imagine himself discovering in his wifes eves
It was not conceivable to him that he should talk over her head
Her glance not only revealed an ample understanding of all he said but suggested unused reserves of comprehension which he might not fathom
It was as if intellectually no less than socially she possessed a title and he remained an undistinguished plebeian
He made no grievance however even in his own thoughts of either inequality
She had been charmingly frank and fair about the question of the names when it first arose
The usage had latterly come to be she explained for a widow bearing even a courtesy title derived from her late husband to retain it on marrying again
It was always the easiest course to fall in with usage but if he had any feelings on the subject and preferred to have her insist on being called Mrs Thorpe she would meet his wishes with entire willingness
It had seemed to him as to her that it was wisest to allow usage to settle the matter
Some months after their marriage there appeared in the papers what purported to be an authoritative announcement that the Queen objected to the practice among ladies who married a second time of retaining titles acquired by the earlier marriages and that the lists of precedency at Buckingham Palace would henceforth take this into account
Lady Cressage showed this to her husband and talked again with candour on the subject
She said she had always rather regretted the decision they originally came to and even now could wish that it might be altered but that to effect a change in the face of this newspaper paragraph would seem servileand in this as in most other things he agreed with her
As she said they wanted nothing of Buckingham Palace
She wanted equally little it seemed of the society which the neighbouring district might afford
There was a meagre routine of formal calls kept in languid operation Thorpe knew but it was so much in the background that he never came in contact with it
His own notions of the part he ought to take in County affairs had undergone a silent and unnoted yet almost sweeping change
What little he saw of the gentry and strong local men with whom he would have to work quietly undermined and dismantled all his ambitions in that direction
They were not his sort their standards for the measurement of things were unintelligible to him
He did not doubt that if he set himself about it he could impose his dominion upon them any more than he doubted that if he mastered the Chinese language he could lift himself to be a Mandarin but the one would be as unnatural and unattractive an enterprise as the other
He came to be upon nodding terms with most of the carriagepeople round about some few he exchanged meaningless words with upon occasion and understood that his wife also talked with when it was unavoidable but there his relationship to the County ended and he was well pleased that it should be so
It gave him a deep satisfaction to see that his wife seemed also well pleased
He used the word seemed in his inmost musings for it was never quite certain what really did please and displease her
It was always puzzling to him to reconcile her undoubted intellectual activity with the practical emptiness of the existence she professed to enjoy
In one direction she had indeed a genuine outlet for her energies which he could understand her regarding in the light of an occupation
She was crazier about flowers and plants than anybody he had ever heard of and it had delighted him to make over to her labelled jocosely as the bouquetfund a sum of money which it seemed to him might have paid for the hanginggardens of Babylon
It yielded in timeemerging slowly but steadily from a prodigious litter of cement and bricks and mortar and putty under the hands of innumerable masons carpenters glaziers plumbers and nondescript subordinates all of whom talked unwearyingly about nothing at all and suffered no man to perform any part of his allotted task without suspending their own labours to watch himan imposing long line of new greenhouses more than twenty in number
The mailbag was filled meanwhile with nurserymens catalogues and the cart made incessant journeys to and from Punsey station bringing back vast strawenwrapped baskets and bundles and boxes beyond counting the arrival and unpacking of which was with Edith the event of the day
About the reality of her engrossed interest in all the stages of progress by which these greenhouses became crowded museums of the unusual and abnormal in plantlife it was impossible to have any suspicion
And even after they were filled to overflowing Thorpe noted with joy that this interest seemed in no wise to flag
She spent hours every day under the glass exchanging comments and theories with her gardeners and even pulling things about with her own hands and other hours she devoted almost as regularly to supervising the wholesale alterations that had been begun in the gardens outside
There were to be new paths new walls with a southern exposure new potting sheds new forcing pits new everythingand in the evenings she often worked late over the maps and plans she drew for all this
Thorpes mind found it difficult to grasp the idea that a lady of such notable qualities could be entirely satisfied by a career among seeds and bulbs and composts but at least time brought no evidences of a decline in her horticultural zeal
Who knew
Perhaps it might go on indefinitely
As for himself he had got on very well without any special inclination or hobby
He had not done any of the great things that a year ago it had seemed to him he would forthwith dobut his mind was serenely undisturbed by regrets
He did not even remember with any distinctness what these things were that he had been going to do
The routine of lifeas arranged and borne along by the wise and tactful experts who wore the livery of High Thorpewas abundantly sufficient in itself
He slept well now in the morning hours and though he remained still by comparison an early riser the bath and the shaving and slow dressing under the hands of a valet consumed comfortably a good deal of time
Throughout the day he was under the almost constant observation of people who were calling him master in their minds and watching to see how in the smallest details of deportment a master carried himself and the consciousness of this alone amounted to a kind of vocation
The house itself made demands upon him nearly as definite as those of the servants
It was a house of huge rooms high ceilings and grandiose fireplaces and stairways which had seemed to him like a royal palace when he first beheld it and still produced upon him an effect of undigestible largeness and strangeness
It was as a whole not so old as the agents had represented it by some centuries but it adapted itself as little to his preconceived notions of domesticity as if it had been built by Druids
The task of seeming to be at home in it had as many sides to it as there were minutes in the dayand oddly enough Thorpe found in their study and observance a congenial occupation
Whether he was reading in the librarywhere there was an admirable collection of books of worthor walking over the homefarms or driving in his smart stanhope with the coachman behind or sitting in formal costume and dignity opposite his beautiful wife at the dinnertable the sense of what was expected of him was there steadying and restraining like an atmospheric pressure
Thus far they had had few visitors and had accepted no invitations to join houseparties elsewhere
They agreed without speaking about it that it was more their form to entertain than to be entertained and certain people were coming to them later in the month
These were quite wholly of Ediths set and selection for Thorpe had no friends or acquaintances outside her circle for whose presence he had any desireand among these prospective guests were a Duke and a Duchess
Once such a fact would have excited Thorpes imagination
He regarded it now as something appropriate under the circumstances and gave it little further thought
His placid satisfied life was not dependent upon the stir of guests coming and going even though they were the great of the earth
He walked on his spacious terrace after luncheona tall portly wellgroomed figure of a man of relaxed easy aspect with his big cigar and his panama hat and his loose clothes of choice fabrics and exquisite tailoringand said to himself that it was the finest view in Englandand then to his own surprise caught himself in the act of yawning
From under the silk curtains and awning of a windowdoorway at the end of the terrace his wife issued and came toward him
Her head was bare and she had the grace and fresh beauty of a young girl in her simple light gown of some summery figured stuff
What do you say to going off somewheretomorrow if you liketravelling abroad
he called out as she approached him
The idea only a moment old in his mind had grown to great proportions
How can we
she asked upon the briefest thought
THEY are coming at the end of the week
This is Monday and they arrive on the 12ththats this Saturday
So soon as that
he exclaimed
I thought it was later
Hm
I dont knowI think perhaps Ill go up to London this evening
Im by way of feeling restless all at once
Will you come up with me
She shook her head
I cant think of anything in London that would be tolerable
He gave a vague little laugh
I shall probably hate it myself when I get there he speculated
There isnt anybody I want to seethere isnt anything I want to do
I don t knowperhaps it might liven me up
Her face took on a look of enquiring gravity
Are you getting tired of it then
She put the question gently almost cautiously
He reflected a little
Whyno he answered as if reasoning to himself
Of course Im not
This is what Ive always wanted
Its my idea of life to a t
OnlyI suppose everything needs a break in it now and thenif only for the comfort of getting back into the old rut again
The rutyes she commented musingly
Apparently theres always a rut
Thorpe gave her the mystified yet uncomplaining glance she knew so well in his eyes
For once the impulse to throw hidden things up into his range of view prevailed with her
Do you know she said with a confused halfsmile at the novelty of her mood for elucidation I fancied a rut was the one thing there could be no question about with you
I had the notion that you were incapable of rutsand conventional grooves
I thought youas Carlyle puts itI thought you were a man who had swallowed all the formulas
Thorpe looked down at his stomach doubtfully
I see what you mean he said at last but in a tone without any note of conviction
I doubt it she told him with light readinessfor I dont see myself what I mean
I forget indeed what it was I said
And so you think youll go up to town tonight
A sudden comprehension of what was slipping away from his grasp aroused him
Nono he urged her dont forget what it was you said
I wish youd talk more with me about that
It was what I wanted to hear
You never tell me what youre really thinking about
She received the reproach with a mildly incredulous smile in her eyes
YesI knowwho was it used to scold me about that
Ohshe seemed suddenly reminded of somethingI was forgetting to mention it
I have a letter from Celia Madden
She is back in England she is coming to us Saturday too
He put out his lips a trifle
Thats all right he objected but what has it got to do with what we were talking about
Talking about
she queried with a momentarily blank countenance
Oh she used to bully me about my deceit and treachery and similar crimes
But I shall be immensely glad to see her
I always fight with her but I think I like her better than any other woman alive
I like her too Thorpe was impelled to say with a kind of solemnity
She reminds me of some of the happiest hours in my life
His wife after a brief glance into his face laughed pleasantly if with a trace of flippancy
You say nice things she observed slightly inclining her head
But now that Celia is coming it would be as well to have another man
Its such dreadfully short notice though
I daresay your father could come all right Thorpe suggested
Id rather have him than almost anyone else
Would you mind asking himor shall I
An abrupt silence marked this introduction of a subject upon which the couple had differed openly
Thorpe through processes unaccountable to himself had passed from a vivid dislike of General Kervick to a habit of mind in which he thoroughly enjoyed having him about
The General had been twice to High Thorpe and on each occasion had so prolonged his stay that in retrospect the period of his absence seemed inconsiderable
The master now thinking upon it in this minute of silence was conscious of having missed him greatly
He would not have been bored to the extremity of threatening to go to London if Kervick had been here
The General was a gentleman and yet had the flexible adaptability of a retainer he had been trained in discipline and hence knew how to defer without becoming fulsome or familiar he was a man of the world and knew an unlimited number of racy stories and even if he repeated some of them unduly they were better than no stories at all
And then there was his matchless unfailing patience in playing chess or backgammon or draughts or bezique whatever he perceived that the master desired
If you really wish it Edith said at last coldly
But thats what I dont understand Thorpe urged upon her with some vigour
If I like him I dont see why his own daughter Oh need we discuss it
she broke in impatiently
If Im an unnatural child why then I am one and may it not be allowed to pass at that
A stormy kind of smile played upon her beautifullycut lips as she added Surely ones filial emotions are things to be taken for grantedrelieved from the necessity of explanation
Thorpe grinned faintly at the hint of pleasantry but he did not relinquish his point
Wellunless you really veto the thingI think Id like to tell him to come he said with composed obstinacy
Upon an afterthought he added Theres no reason why he shouldnt meet the Duke is there
No specific reason she returned with calm coolness of tone and manner
And certainly I do not see myself in the part of Madame Veto
All right thenIll send him a wire said Thorpe
His victory made him uneasy yet he saw no way of abandoning it with decorum
As the two standing in a silence full of tacit constraint looked aimlessly away from the terrace they saw at the same instant a vehicle with a single horse coming rather briskly up the driveway some hundreds of yards below
It was recognizable at once as the local trap from Punsey station and as usual it was driven by a boy from the village
Seated beside this lad was a burly redbearded man in respectable clothes who to judge from the tinbox and travellingbags fastened on behind seemed coming to High Thorpe to stay
Who on earth is that
asked Thorpe wonderingly
The man was obviously of the lower class yet there seemed something about him which invited recognition
Presumably its the new headgardener she replied with brevity
Her accent recalled to Thorpe the fact that there had been something disagreeable in their conversation and the thought of it was unpleasant to him
Why I didnt know you had a new man coming he said turning to her with an overture of smiling interest
Yes she answered and then as if weighing the proffered propitiation and rejecting it turned slowly and went into the house
The trap apparently ended its course at some back entrance he did not see it again
He strolled indoors after a little and told his man to pack a bag for London and order the stanhope to take him to the train
CHAPTER XXIII IN the early morning long before any of the hotel people had made themselves heard moving about Thorpe got up
It was a long time since he had liked himself and his surroundings so little
The bed seemed all right to the eye and even to the touch but he had slept very badly in it none the less
The room was luxuriously furnished as was the entire suite but it was all strange and uncomfortable to his senses
The operation of shaving and dressing in solitude produced an oppression of loneliness
He regretted not having brought his man with him for this reason and then upon meditation for other reasons
A person of his position ought always to have a servant with him
The hotel people must have been surprised at his travelling unattendedand the people at High Thorpe must also have thought it strange
It flashed across his mind that no doubt his wife had most of all thought it strange
How would she explain to herself his sudden precipitate journey to London alone
Might she not quite naturally put an unpleasant construction upon it
It was bad enough to have to remember that they had parted in something like a tiff he found it much worse to be fancying the suspicions with which she would be turning over his mysterious absence in her mind
He went downstairs as speedily as possible and discovering no overt signs of breakfast in the vicinity of the restaurant passed out and made his way to the Embankment
This had been a favourite walk of his in the old daysbut he considered it now with an unsympathetic eye
It seemed a dry and haggard and desolatelooking place by comparison with his former impressions of it
The morning was greyskied but full of a hard quality of light which brought out to the uncompromising uttermost the dilapidated squalor of the Surrey side
The water was low and from the mud and ooze of the ugly opposite shore or perhaps from the discoloured stream itself there proceeded a smell which offended his unaccustomed nostril
A fitful gusty wind was blowing from the east and ever and again it gathered dust in eddying swoops from the roadway and flung it in his face
He walked on toward the City without any conscious purpose and with no very definite reflections
It occurred to him that if his wife did impute to him some unworthy motive in stealing off to London and made herself unhappy in doing sothat would at least provide the compensation of showing that she cared
The thought however upon examination contained very meagre elements of solace
He could not in the least be sure about any of the workings of her mind
There might be more or less annoyance mixed up this morning with the secret thoughts she had concerning himor she might not be bothering her head about him at all
This latter contingency had never presented itself so frankly to him before
He looked hard at it and saw more semblances of probability about it than he liked
It might very well be that she was not thinking about him one way or the other
A depressing consciousness that practically nobody need think about him pervaded his soul
Who cared what he said or did or felt
The City had forgotten his very existence
In the West End only here and there some person might chance to remember his name as that of some rich bounder who had married Lady Cressage
Nowhere else in England save one dull strip of agricultural blankness in a backward home county was there a human being who knew anything whatever about him
And this was his career
It was for this that he had planned that memorable campaign and waged that amazing series of fortnightly battles never missing victory never failing at any point of the complicated strategy and crowning it all with a culminating triumph which had been the wonder and admiration of the whole financial world
A few score of menials or interested inferiors bowed to him he drove some good horses and was attentively waited upon and had a neverfailing abundance of good things to eat and drink aud smoke
Hardly anything more than that when you came to think of itand the passing usufruct of all these things could be enjoyed by any fool who had a tenpound note in his pocket
What gross trick had the fates played on him
He had achieved powerand where was that power
What had he done with it
What COULD he do with it
He had an excess of wealth it was true but in what way could it command an excess of enjoyment
The very phrase was a paradox as he dimly perceived
There existed only a narrow margin of advantage in favour of the rich man
He could eat and drink a little more and a little better than the poor man he could have better clothes and lie abed later in the morning and take life easier all roundbut only within hard and fast bounds
There was an ascertained limit beyond which the millionaire could no more stuff himself with food and wine than could the beggar
It might be pleasant to take an added hour or two in bed in the morning but to lie in bed all day would be an infliction
So it ran indefinitelythis thin selvedge of advantage which money could buywith deprivation on the one side and surfeit on the other
Candidly was it not true that more happiness lay in winning the way out of deprivation than in inventing safeguards against satiety
The poor man succeeding in making himself richat numerous stages of the operation there might be made a moral snapshot of the truly happy man
But not after he had reached the top
Then disintegration began at once
The contrast between what he supposed he could do and what he finds it possible to do is too vast to be accepted with equanimity
It must be said that after breakfasta meal which he found in an Italian restaurant of no great cleanliness or opulence of pretension and ate with an almost novel relishThorpe took somewhat less gloomy views of his position
He still walked eastward wandering into warehouse and shipping quarters skirting the river hitherto quite unknown to him and pursuing in an idle inconsequent fashion his meditations
He established in his mind the proposition that since an excess of enjoyment was impossiblesince one could not derive a great block of happiness from the satisfaction of the ordinary appetites but at the most could only gather a little from eachthe desirable thing was to multiply as much as might be those tastes and whims and fancies which passed for appetites and thus expand the area of possible gratification
This seemed very logical indeed but it did not apply itself to his individual needs with much facility
What did he want to do that he had not done
It was difficult for him to say
Perhaps it was chandlers signs and windows about him and the indefinable seafaring preoccupation suggested by the highwalled narrow streets which raised the question of a yacht in his mind
Did he want a yacht
He could recall having once dwelt with great fondness upon such a project doubtless it would still be full of attractions for him
He liked the water and the water liked himand he was better able now than formerly to understand how luxurious existence can be made in modern private ships
He decided that he would have a yachtand then perceived that the decision brought no exhilaration
He was no happier than before
He could decide that he would have anything he chose to nameand it would in no whit lighten his mood
The yacht might be as grand as High Thorpe and relatively as spacious and well ordered but would he not grow as tired of the one as he had of the other
He stopped short at this blunt selfexpression of something he had never admitted to himself
Was he indeed tired of High Thorpe
He had assured his wife to the contrary yesterday
He reiterated the assurance to his own mind now
It was instead that he was tired of himself
He carried a weariness about with him which looked at everything with apathetic eyes and cared for nothing
Some nameless paralysis had settled upon his capacity for amusement and enjoyment and atrophied it
He had had the power to expand his life to the farthest boundaries of rich experience and sensation and he had deliberately shrunk into a sort of herbaceous nonentity whom nobody knew or cared about
He might have had London at his beck and call and yet of all that the metropolis might mean to a millionaire he had been able to think of nothing better than that it should send old Kervick to him to help beguile his boredom with dominoes and messroom stories
Pah
He was disgusted with himself
Striking out a new course with the Monument as his guide he presently came into a part of the City which had a certain familiarity for him
He walked up St Swithins Lane looking at the strange forms of foreign fruit exposed at the shopdoors and finding in them some fleeting recurrence of the hint that travel was what he needed
Then he stopped to look through the railings and open gateway at an enclosure on the left and the substantial heavilyrespectable group of early Victorian buildings beyond
Some welldressed men were standing talking in one of the porches
The stiff yellowishstucco pilasters of this entrance and the tall uniformed figure of the porter in the shadow came into the picture as he observed it they gave forth a suggestion of satisfied smugnessof orderly but altogether unillumined routine
Nothing could be more commonplace to the eye
Yet to his imagination eighteen months before what mysterious marvels of power had lurked hidden behind those conventional portals
Within those doors in some inner chamber sat men whose task it was to direct the movements of the greatest force the world had ever known
They and their cousins in Paris and Frankfort or wherever they lived between them wielded a vaster authority than all the Parliaments of the earth
They could change a government or crush the aspirations of a whole people or decide a question of peace or war by the silent dictum of their little family council
He remembered now how he had stood on this same spot and stared with fascinated gaze at this quadrangle of dull houses and pondered upon what it must feel like to be a Rothschildand that was only a little over a year ago
There was no sense of fascination whatever in his present gaze
He found himself regarding instead with a kind of detached curiosity the little knot of men in frockcoats and silkhats who stood talking in the doorway
It was barely ten oclock yet clearly business was proceeding within
One of these persons whom he beheld might be a Rothschild for aught he knew at any rate it was presumable that some of them were on the premises
He had heard it said that the very head of the house listened to quotations from the tape while he ate his luncheon and interrupted his conversations with the most important of noncommercial callers to make or refuse bargains in shares offered by brokers who came in
What impulse lay behind this extraordinary devotion to labour
Toward what conceivable goal could it be striving
To work hard and risk great things for the possession of a fortune in order to enjoy it afterwardhe could understand how that attracted men
But to possess already the biggest of human fortunes and still work that baffled him
He wished he knew some of those men in there especially if they belonged to the place
It would be wonderfully interesting to get at the inner point of view of New Court
A little later in Colin Semples office he sat down to await the coming of that gentleman
Then he doesnt get here so early nowadays
he suggested to the headclerk who with instant recognition and exaggerated deference had ushered him into this furthermost private room
It pleased him to assume that prosperity had relaxed the Scotchmans vigilance
Oh yes sir the clerk replied
A bit earlier if anything as a rule
But I think he is stopping at his solicitors on his way to the City
I hope you are very well sir
YesIm very fitthanks Thorpe said listlessly and the other left him
Mr Semple when at last he arrived bustled into the room with unaffected gratification at the news he had heard without
Well well Thorpe man
he cried and shook hands cordially
This is fine
If Id only known you were in town
Why wouldnt you have told me you were coming
Id never have kept you waiting
Thorpe laughed wearily
I hardly knew I was in town myself
I only ran up last night
I thought it would amuse me to have a look roundbut things seem as dull as ditchwater
Oh no said Semple the autumn is opening verra well indeed
There are more new companies and a better public subscription all round than for any first week of October I remember
Westralians appear bad on the face of things its truebut dont believe all you hear of them
Theres more than the suspicion of a rig there
Besides you havent a penny in them
I wasnt thinking of that Thorpe told him with comprehensive vagueness
Well I suppose youre still coining money he observed after a pause
Keeping alongkeeping along the broker replied cheerfully
I canna complain
Thorpe looked at him with a meditative frown
Well what are you going to do with it after youve got it
he demanded almost with sharpness
The Scotchman after a surprised instant smiled
Oh Ill just keep my hands on it he assured him lightly
That isnt what I mean Thorpe said groping after what he did mean with sullen tenacity among his thoughts
His large heavy face exhibited a depressed gravity which attracted the others attention
Whats the matter
Semple asked quickly
Has anything gone wrong with you
Thorpe slowly shook his head
What better off do you think youll be with six figures than you are with five
he pursued with dogmatic insistence
Semple shrugged his shoulders
He seemed to have grown much brighter and gayer of mood in this past twelvemonth
Apparently he was somewhat stouter and certainly there was a mellowed softening of his sharp glance and shrewd smile
It was evident that his friends mood somewhat nonplussed him but his goodhumour was unflagging
Its the way were taught at school he hazarded genially
In all the arithmetics six beats five and seven beats six
Theyre wrong Thorpe declared and then consented to laugh in a grudging dogged way at his friends facial confession of puzzlement
What I mean iswhats the good of piling up money while you cant pile up the enjoyments it will buy
What will a million give you that the fifth of it or the tenth of it wont give you just as well
Aye said Semple with a gleam of comprehension in his glance
So youve come to that frame of mind have you
Why does a man go on and shoot five hundred pheasants when he can eat only one
Oh if you like the mere making of money Ive nothing more to say Thorpe responded with a touch of resentment
Ive always thought of you as a man like myself who wanted to make his pile and then enjoy himself
The Scotchman laughed joyously
Enjoy myself
Like you
he cried
Man youre as doleful as a mute at a lairds funeral
Whats come over you
I know what it is
You go and take a course of German waters Oh that be damned
Thorpe objected gloomily
I tell you Im all right
OnlyonlyGod
Ive a great notion to go and get drunk
Colin Semple viewed his companion with a more sympathetic expression
Im sorry youre so hipped he said in gentle tones
It cant be more than some passing whimsy
Youre in no real trouble are youno family trouble
Thorpe shook his head
The whole thing is rot
he affirmed enigmatically
What whole thing
The broker perched on the edge of his desk and with patient philosophy took him up
Do you mean eighty thousand a year is rot
That depends upon the man who has it
I know that well enough broke in the other heavily
Thats what Im kicking about
Im no good
Semple looking attentively down upon him pursed his lips in reflection
Thats not the case he observed with argumentative calmness
Youre a great deal of good
Im not so sure that what youve been trying to do is any good though
ComeI read you like large print
Youve set out to live the life of a rich country squireand it hasnt come off
It couldnt come off
I never believed it would
You havent the taste for it inbred in your bones
You havent the thousand little habits and interests that they take in with their mothers milk and that make such a life possible
When you look at a hedge you dont think of it as something to worry live animals out of
When you see one of your labourers you dont care who his father was or which dairymaid his uncle ought to have married if he had wanted to get a certain cottage
You dont want to know the name of everybody whose roof you can see much less could you remember them and talk about them and listen to gossip about them year after year
It isnt a passion in your blood to ride to hounds and to shoot and all that
It doesnt come to you by traditionand you havent the vacancy of mind which might be a substitute for tradition
What are you doing in the country then
Just eating too much and sitting about and getting fat and stupid
If you want the truth there it is for you
Thorpe putting out his lips judicially inclined upon reflection to the view that this was the truth
Thats all right as far as it goes he assented with hesitation
But what the hell else is there
The little Scotchman had grown too interested in his diagnosis to drop it in an incomplete state
A year ago he went on you had won your victories like a veritable Napoleon
You had everything in your own hands Napoleon himself was not more the master of what he saw about him than you were
And then what did you do
You voluntarily retired yourself to your Elba
It wasnt that you were beaten and driven there by others you went of your own accord
Have you ever thought Thorpe of this
Napoleon was the greatest man of his ageone of the greatest men of all agesnot only in war but in a hundred other ways
He spent the last six years of his life at St Helenain excellent health and with companions that he talked freely toand in all the extraordinarily copious reports of his conversations there we dont get a single sentence worth repeating
If you read it youll see he talked like a dull ordinary body
The greatness had entirely evaporated from him the moment he was put on an island where he had nothing to do
Yess said Thorpe thoughtfully
He accepted the application without any qualms about the splendour of the comparison it rested upon
He had done the great things just as Semple said and there was no room for false modesty about them in his mind
The trouble is he began that I did what I had always thought I wanted to do most
I was quite certain in my mind that that was what I wanted
And if we say now that I was wrongif we admit that that wasnt what I really wantedwhy then God knows what it is I DO want
Ill be hanged if I do
Come back to the City Semple told him
Thats where you belong
Nono
Thorpe spoke with emphasis
Thats where youre all off
I dont belong in the City at all
I hate the whole outfit
What the devil amusement would it be to me to take other mens money away from them
Id be wanting all the while to give it back to them
And certainly I wouldnt get any fun out of their taking my money away from me
Besides it doesnt entertain me
Ive no taste at all for it
I never look at a financial paper now
I could no more interest myself in all that stuff again than I could fly
Thats the hell of itto be interested in anything
Go in for politics the other suggested with less warmth
Yes I know Thorpe commented with a lingering tone
Perhaps I ought to think more about that
By the way whats Plowden doing
Ive lost all track of him
Abroad somewhere I fancy Semple replied
His manner exhibited a profound indifference
When his mother died he came into somethingI dont know how much
I dont think Ive seen him sinceand that must have been six months and more ago
Yes
I heard about it at the time the other said
It must be about that
His sister and brotherthe young Plowdenstheyre coming to us at the end of the week I believe
You didnt hit it off particularly with Plowden eh
Semple emitted a contemptuous little laugh
I did not quarrel with himif you mean that he said but even to please you Thorpe I couldnt bring myself to put my back into the job of making money for him
He was treated fairlyeven generously dye mind
I should think all told he had some thirty thousand pounds for his shares and thats a hundred times as much as I had a pleasure in seeing him get
Each man can wear his own parasites but its a task for him to stand another mans
I shook your Lord Plowden off when the chance came
THATS all right Thorpe assured him easily
I never told you that he was any good
I merely felt like giving him a leg upbecause really at the start he was of use to me
I did owe him somethingIt was at his house that I met my wife
Aye said Semple with dispassionate brevity
CHAPTER XXIV WHEN he had parted with Semple at a corner where the busy broker who had walked out with him obviously fidgeted to get away Thorpe could think of no one else in the City whom he desired to see
A call upon his bankers would he knew be made an occasion of extremely pleasant courtesy by those affable people but upon reflection it seemed scarcely worth the trouble
He was in a mood for indolent sauntering and he made the long stretch of the Holborn thoroughfare in a leisurely fashion turning off when the whim seized him into odd courts and alleyways to see what they were like
After luncheon he continued his ramble passing at last from St Giles through avenues which had not existed in the London of his boyhood to the neighbourhood of the Dials
Here also the landmarks seemed all changed but there was still enough ostentatious squalor and disorder to identify the district
He observed it and its inhabitants with a certain new curiosity
A notable alteration for the better had come over his spirits
It might be the champagne at luncheon or it might be the mere operation of a frank talk with Semple that had dissipated his gloom
At all events it was goneand he strolled along in quite placid contentment taking in the panorama of Londons more intimate life with the interest of a Londoner who has obtained a fresh country eye
He who had seen most of the world and not cared much about the spectacle found himself now consciously enjoying observation as he had not supposed it possible to do
He surrendered himself to the experience with a novel sense of having found something worth whileand found it moreover under his very nose
In some dull meaningless fashion he had always known this part of London and been familiar with its external aspects
Now suddenly he perceived that the power had come to him of seeing it all in a different way
The objects he beheld inanimate and otherwise had specific new meanings for him
His mind was stirred pleasurably by the things they said to him
He looked at all the contents of the windows as he passed at the barrows of the costers and hawkers crowding up the sidestreets at the coarsehaired bareheaded girls and women standing about in their shawls and big white aprons at the weakling babies in their arms or about the thick clumsy folds of their stained skirts at the grimy shuffling figures of their menfolk against the accustomed background of the publichouse corner with its halfopen door and its flyblown theatrebills in the windows at the drivers of the vans and carts sleepily overlooking the huge horses gigantic to the near view as some survival from the age of mammoths which pushed gingerly ploddingly their tufted feet over the greasy stones at foul interiors where through the blackness one discerned bent old hags picking over refuse at the faces which as he passed made some special human appeal to himfaces blurred with drink faces pallid with underfeeding faces worn into masks by the tension of trouble faces sweetened by resignation faces aglow with devilmaycare gleehe looked as it were into the pulsing heart of something which had scarcely seemed alive to him before
Eventually he found himself halting at the door of his sisters bookshop
A new boy stood guard over the stock exposed on the shelf and stands outside and he looked stonily at the great man it was evident that he was as far from suspecting his greatness as his relationship
It pleased Thorpe for a little to take up one book after another and pretend to read from it and force the boy to watch him hard
He had almost the temptation to covertly slip a volume into his pocket and see what the lad would do
It was remarkable he reflected with satisfactionthis new capacity within him to find drama in trifles
There floated into his mind the recollection of some absurd squabble he had had with his sister about the sign overhead
He stepped back a few paces and looked up at it
There were the old wordsThorpe Booksellerright enough but they seemed to stand forth with a novel prominence
Upon a second glance he saw that the board had been repainted
At this he laughed aloud
The details of the episode came back to him now
For some reason or no reason at allhe could not now imagine what on earth could have prompted himhe had last spring caused his sister to be informed of his wish that her own name Dabney should be substituted for that of Thorpe on her sign
It was to Julia that he had confided this mission and it was Julia who in a roundabout way had disclosed to him presently her mothers deep resolution to do nothing of the sort
He laughed again at the added defiance that this refurbishing of the old sign expressed and still was grinning broadly as he entered the shop and pushed his way along to the rear
She stood beside her desk as she seemed to have stood ever since he could remember hertall placid dulleyed selfsufficient exhaling as it were a kind of stubborn yet competent listlessness
Her long mannish countenance expressed an undoubted interest in his presence when she recognized him but he had no clear perception whether it was pleased or otherwise
In their infrequent latterday encounters he had dropped the habit of kissing her and there was certainly no hint in her manner of expecting much less inviting its renewal nowbut upon a sudden impulse he drew her to him with an arm flung round her gaunt waist smacked his lips with effusion upon her cheek
Her surprise as she withdrew herself somewhat forcefully from his embrace was plain enough
Well
she exclaimed vaguely and then looked at him
Youre getting fatter
No Im not he rejoined with the earnestness belonging to an important topic
People think I ambut its merely the looseness of these clothes
Theres really no difference since I was here last
The glance they exchanged was so full of the tacit comment that this last visit was a long time ago that Thorpe put it into words
Lets seethat was just before Christmas wasnt it
he said
Something like that she responded
You were going to get married in a week or two I remember and THAT was in January wasnt it
I was taking stock I know
He nodded in turn
The thought that his only sister recalled his marriage merely as a date like a royal anniversary or a bankholiday and held herself implacably aloof from all contact with his domestic life annoyed him afresh
Youre an awful goat not to come near us he felt impelled in brotherly frankness to tell her
She put out her lips and wagged her head a little in a gesture which it flashed across him his own mirror might often have recorded
I thought that was all settled and done with long ago she said moodily
Oh I wont worry you with it Lou he observed with reassuring kindness of tone
I never felt so much like being nice to you in my life
She seemed surprised at this too and regarded him with a heavy new fixity of gaze
No verbal comment apparently occurred to her
Julia and Alfred all right
he queried cheerfully
I daresay she made brief answer
But they write to you dont they
SHE doessometimes
They seem to be doing themselves very well from what she says
Shed write oftener if youd answer her letters he told her in tones of confidential reproach
Oh I dont write letters unless Ive got something to say she answered as if the explanation were ample
The young people were domiciled for the time being at Dusseldorf where Alfred had thought he would most like to begin his Continental studentcareer and where Julia upon the more or less colourable pretext of learning the language might enjoy the mingled freedom and occupation of a home of her own
They had taken a house for the summer and autumn and would do the same in Dresden or Munich later on for the winter
What I would really have liked Thorpe confided to his sister now was to have had them both live with me
They would have been as welcome as the day is long
I could see of course in Alfreds case that if hes set on being an artist he ought to study abroad
Even the best English artists he says do that at the beginning
So it was all right for him to go
But Juliait was different with herI was rather keen about her staying
My wife was just as keen as I was
She took the greatest fancy to Julia from the very startand so far as I could see Julia liked her all right
In fact I thought Julia would want to staybut somehow she didnt
She always spoke very highly of your wife Mrs Dabney affirmed with judicial fairness
I think she does like her very much
Well then what did she want to hyke off to live among those Dutchmen for when one of the best houses in England was open to her
Thorpe demanded
You mustnt ask me her mother responded
Her tone seemed to carry the suggestion that by silence she could best protect her daughters interests
I dont believe you know any more about it than I do was his impulsive comment
I daresay not she replied with indifference
Probably she didnt fancy living in so big a house although heaven knows her ideas are big enough about most things
Did she say so
Thorpe asked abruptly
The widow shook her head with dispassionate candour
She didnt say anything to me about it one way or the other
I formed my own impressionsthats all
Its a free country
Everybody can form their impressions
I wish youd tell me what you really think Thorpe urged her mildly persuasive
You know how fond I am of Julia and how little I want to do her an injustice
Oh she wouldnt feel THAT way Louisa observed vaguely
If you ask me plain I think it was dull for her
Well said Thorpe upon reflection I shouldnt be surprised if it was
I hadnt thought of that
But stillwhy she and my wife could be company for each other
You talk as if life was merely a long railway journey she told him in an unexpected flight of metaphor
Two women cooped up in a lonesome country house may be a little less lonely than one of them by herself would bebut not much
Its none of my businessbut how your wife must hate it
He laughed easily
Ah thats where youre wrong he said
She doesnt care about anything but gardening
Thats her hobby
Shes crazy about it
Weve laid out more in new greenhouses alone not counting the plants than would rebuild this building
Im not sure the heating apparatus wouldnt come to that alone
And then the plants
What do you think of six and eight guineas for a single root
Those are the amaryllisesand if you come to orchids you can pay hundreds if you like
Well thats her passion
Thats what she really loves
Thats what she seizes upon to keep her from just dying of loneliness Louisa retorted obstinately and at a sign of dissent from her brother she went on
Oh I know what Im talking about
I have three or four customersladies in the country and one of them is a lady of title tooand they order gardening books and other books through me and when they get up to town once a year or so they come here and they talk to me about it
And there isnt one of them that at the bottom of her heart doesnt hate it
Theyd rather dodge busses at Charing Cross corner all day long than raise flowers as big as cheeses if they had their own way
But they dont have their own way and they must have something to occupy themselves withand they take to gardening
I daresay Id even do it myself if I had to live in the country which thank God I dont
Thats because you dont know anything about the country he told her but the retort even while it justified itself had a hollow sound in his own ears
All you know outside of London is Margate
I went to Yarmouth and Lowestoft this summer she informed him crushingly
Somehow he lacked the heart to laugh
I know what you mean Lou he said with an affectionate attempt at placation
I suppose theres a good deal in what you say
It is dull out there at my place if you have too much of it
Perhaps thats a good hint about my wife
It never occurred to me but it may be so
But the deuce of it is what else is there to do
We tried a house in London during the Season Yes I saw in the papers you were here she said impassively in comment upon his embarrassed pause
I didnt look you up because I didnt think you wanted much to see mehe explained with a certain awkwardnessbut byegones are all byegones
We took a town house but we didnt like it
It was one endless procession of stupid and tiresome calls and dinners and parties we got awfully sick of it and swore we wouldnt try it again
Well there you are dont you see
Its stupid in Hertfordshire and its stupid here
Of course one can travel abroad but thats no good for more than a few months
Of course it would be different if I had something to do
I tell you Gods truth Lousometimes I feel as if I was really happier when I was a poor man
I know its all rotI really wasntbut sometimes it SEEMS as if I was
She contemplated him with a leaden kind of gaze
Didnt it ever occur to you to do some good with your money
she said with slow bluntness
Then as if fearing a possible misconception she added more rapidly  I dont mean among your own family
Were a clannish people we Thorpes wed always help our own flesh and blood even if we kicked them while we were doing itbut I mean outside in the world at large
What have I got to do with the world at large
I didnt make it Im not responsible for it
He muttered the phrases lightly enough but a certain fatuity in them seemed to attract his attention when he heard their sound
Ive given between five and six thousand pounds to London hospitals within the present year he added straightening himself
I wonder you didnt see it
It was in all the papers
Hospitals
It was impossible to exaggerate the scorn which her voice imported into the word
He looked at her with unfeigned surprise and then took in the impression that she was upon a subject which exceptionally interested her
Certainly the display of something approaching animation in her glance and manner was abnormal
I said do some GOOD with your money she reminded him still with a vibration of feeling in her tone
You must live in the country if you think London hospitals are deserving objects
They couldnt fool Londoners on that point not if they had got the Prince to go on his hands and knees
And you give a few big cheques to them she went on meditatively and you never ask how theyre managed or what rings are running them for their own benefit or how your money is spentand you think youve done a noble philanthropic thing
Oh noI wasnt talking about humbug charity
I was talking about doing some genuine good in the world
He put his leg over the high stool and pushed his hat back with a smile
All right he said genially
What do you propose
I dont propose anything she told him after a moments hesitation
You must work that out for yourself
What might seem important to me might not interest you at alland if you werent interested you wouldnt do anything
But this I do say to you Joeland Ive said it to myself every day for this last year or more and had you in mind all the time tooif I had made a great fortune and I sat about in purple and fine linen doing nothing but amuse myself in idleness and selfishness letting my riches accumulate and multiply themselves without being of use to anybody I should be ASHAMED to look my fellowcreatures in the face
You were born here
You know what London slums are like
You know what Clare Market was likeits bad enough stilland what the Seven Dials and Drury Lane and a dozen other places round here are like to this day
Thats only within a stones throw
Have you seen Charles Booths figures about the London poor
Of course you haventand it doesnt matter
You KNOW what they are like
But you dont care
The misery and ignorance and filth and hopelessness of two or three hundred thousand people doesnt interest you
You sit upon your moneybags and smile
If you want the truth Im ashamed to have you for a brother
Well Im damned
was Thorpes delayed and puzzled comment upon this outburst
He looked long at his sister in blank astonishment
Since when have you been taken this way
he asked at last mechanically jocular
Thats all right she declared with defensive inconsequence
Its the way I feel
Its the way Ive felt from the beginning
He was plainly surprised out of his equanimity by this unlookedfor demonstration on his sisters part
He got off the stool and walked about in the little cleared space round the desk
When he spoke it was to utter something which he could trace to no mental process of which he had been conscious
How do you know that that isnt what Ive felt toofrom the beginning
he demanded of her almost with truculence
You say I sit on my moneybags and smileyou abuse me with doing no good with my moneyhow do you know I havent been studying the subject all this while and making my plans and getting ready to act
You never did believe in me
She sniffed at him
I dont believe in you now at all events she said bluntly
He assumed the expression of a misunderstood man
Why this very dayhe began and again was aware that thoughts were coming up readyshaped to his tongue which were quite strangers to his brainthis whole day Ive been going inch by inch over the very ground you mention Ive been on foot since morning seeing all the corners and alleys of that whole district for myself watching the people and the things they buy and the way they liveand thinking out my plans for doing something
I dont claim any credit for it
It seems to me no more than what a man in my position ought to do
But I own that to come in actually tired out from a tramp like that and get blownup by ones own sister for selfishness and heartlessness and miserliness and all the rest of itI must say thats a bit rum
Louisa did not wince under this reproach as she might have been expected to do nor was there any perceptible amelioration in the heavy frown with which she continued to regard him
But her words uttered after some consideration came in a tone of voice which revealed a desire to avoid offense
It wont matter to you your getting blownup by me if youre really occupying your mind with that sort of thing
Youre too used to it for that
He would have liked a less cautious acceptance of his assurances than thisbut after all one did not look to Louisa for enthusiasms
The depth of feeling she had disclosed on this subject of Londons poor still astonished him but principally now because of its unlikely source
If she had been notoriously of an altruistic and freehanded disposition he could have understood it
But she had been always the hard dry unemotional one by comparison with her he felt himself to be a volatile and even sentimental person
If she had such views as these it became clear to him that his own views were even much advanced
Its a tremendous subject he said with loose largeness of manner
Only a man who works hard at it can realize how complicated it is
The only way is to start with the understanding that something is going to be done
No matter how many difficulties there are in the way SOMETHINGS GOING TO BE DONE
If a strong man starts out with that why then he can fight his way through and push the difficulties aside or bend them to suit his purpose and accomplish something
Mrs Dabney listening to this found nothing in it to quarrel withyet somehow remained if not skeptical then passively unconvinced
What are your plans
she asked him
Oh its too soon to formulate anything he told her with prepared readiness
It isnt a thing to rush into in a hurry with half baked theories and limited information
Great results permanent results are never obtained that way
I hope it isnt any Peabody modeldwelling thing
Oh nothing like it in the least he assured her and made a mental note to find out what it was she had referred to
The LordRowton houses are better they say she went on but it seems to me that the real thing is that there shouldnt be all this immense number of people with only fourpence or fivepence in their pocket
Thats where the real mischief lies
He nodded comprehendingly but hesitated over further words
Then something occurred to him
Look here
he said
If youre as keen about all this are you game to give up this footling old shop and devote your time to carrying out my plans when Ive licked em into shape
She began shaking her head but then something seemed also to occur to her
Itll be time enough to settle that when we get to it wont it
she observed
Noyouve got to promise me now he told her
Well that I wont
she answered roundly
Youd see the wholethe whole scheme come to nothing would you
he scolded at herrather than abate a jot of your confounded mulishness
Aha
she commented with a certain alertness of perception shining through the stolidity of her mien
I knew you were humbugging
If youd meant what you said you wouldnt talk about its coming to nothing because I wont do this or that
I ought to have known better
Im always a goose when I believe what you tell me
A certain abstract justice in her reproach impressed him
No youre not Lou he replied coaxingly
I really mean it allevery word of itand more
It only occurred to me that it would all go better if you helped
Cant you understand how I should feel that
She seemed in a grudging way to accept anew his professions of sincerity but she resisted all attempts to extract any promise
I dont believe in crossing a bridge till I get to it she declared when on the point of his departure he last raised the question and it had to be left at that
He took with him some small books she had tied in a parcel and told him to read
She had spoken so confidently of their illuminating value that he found himself quite committed to their perusaland almost to their endorsement
He had thought during the day of running down to Newmarket for the Cesarewitch was to be run on the morrow and someone had told him that that was worth seeing
By the time he reached his hotel however an entirely new project had possessed his mind
He packed his bag and took the next train for home
CHAPTER XXV I DIDNT ask your father after all was one of the things that Thorpe said to his wife next day
He had the manner of one announcing a concession albeit in an affable spirit and she received the remark with a scant silent nod
Two days later he recurred to the subject
They were again upon the terrace where he had been lounging in an easychair most of the day with the books his sister had bid him read on a table beside him
He had glanced through some of them in a desultory fashion cutting pages at random here and there but for the most part he had looked straight before him at the broad landscape mellowing now into soft browns and yellows under the mild vague October sun
He had not thought much of the books but he had a certain new sense of enjoyment in the fruits of this placid abstracted rumination which perhaps they had helped to induce
About your father he said now as his wife who had come out to speak with him on some other matter was turning to go away again Im afraid I annoyed you the other day by what I said
I have no recollection of it she told him with tranquil politeness over her shoulder
He found himself all at once keenly desirous of a conversation on this topic
But I want you to recollect he said as he rose to his feet
There was a suggestion of urgency in his tone which arrested her attention
She moved slowly toward the chair and after a little perched herself upon one of its big arms and looked up at him where he leant against the parapet
Ive thought of it a good deal he went on in halting explanation
His purpose seemed clearer to him than were the right phrases in which to define it
I persisted in saying that Id do something you didnt want me to dosomething that was a good deal more your affair than mineand Ive blamed myself for it
That isnt at all what I want to do
Her face as well as her silence showed her to be at a loss for an appropriate comment
She was plainly surprised and seemingly embarrassed as well
Im sure you always wish to be nice she said at last
The words and tone were alike gracious but he detected in them somewhere a perfunctory note
Ohnice
he echoed in a sudden stress of impatience with the word
Damn being nice
Anybody can be nice
Im thinking of something ten thousand times bigger than being nice
I withdraw the word immediatelyunreservedly she put in with a smile in which he read that genial mockery he knew so well
You laugh at mewhenever I try to talk seriously he objected
I laugh
she queried with an upward glance of demurely simulated amazement
Impossible
I assure you Ive forgotten how
Ah now we get to it
he broke out with energy
Youre really feeling about it just as I am
Youre not satisfied with what were doingwith the life were leadingany more than I am
I see that plain enough now
I didnt dream of it before
Somehow I got the idea that you were enjoying it immenselythe greenhouses and gardens and all that sort of thing
And do you know who it was that put me rightthat told me you hated it
Oh dont let us talk of him
Edith exclaimed swiftly
Thorpe laughed
Youre wrong
It wasnt your father
I didnt see him
Noit was my sister
Shes never seen you but all the same she knew enough to give me points
She told me I was a fool to suppose you were happy here
How clever of her
A certain bantering smile accompanied the words but on the instant it faded away
She went on with a musing gravity
Im sorry I dont get to know your sister
She seems an extremely real sort of person
I can understand that she might be difficult to live withI daresay all genuine characters arebut shes very real
Although apparently conversation isnt her strong point still I enjoy talking with her
How do you mean
Thorpe asked knitting his brows in puzzlement
Oh I often go to her shopor did when I was in town
I went almost immediately after ourour return to England
I was half afraid she would recognize methe portraits in the papers you knowbut apparently she didnt
And its splendidthe way she says absolutely nothing more than its necessary to say
And her candour
If she thinks books are bad she says so
Fancy that
He still frowned uneasily as he looked down at her
You never mentioned to me that you had gone there he told her as if in reproach
Ah it was complicated Edith explained
She objects to knowing meI think secretly I respect her a great deal for thatand therefore there is something clandestine about my getting to know herand I could not be sure how it would impress you and really it seemed simplest not to mention it
It isnt that alone he declared gravefaced still but with a softer voice
Do you remember what I said the other day
It would make all the difference in the world to me ifif you were reallyactually my other half
The phrase which he had caught at seemed as it fell upon the air to impregnate it with some benumbing quality
The husband and wife looked dumbly almost vacantly at one another for what appeared a long time
I meanall at once Thorpe found tongue and even a sort of fluency as he progressedI mean if you shared things really with me
Oh Im not complaining you mustnt think that
The agreement we made at the startyouve kept your part of it perfectly
Youve done better than that youve kept still about the fact that it made you unhappy
Oh no she interposed gently
It is not the fact that it has made me unhappy
Welldiscontented then he resumed without pause
Here we are
We do the thing we want to dowe make the kind of home for ourselves that weve agreed we would likeand then it turns out that somehow it doesnt come up to expectations
You get tired of it
I suppose if the truth were known Im by way of being tired of it too
Well if you look at it that fact is the most important thing in the world for both of us
Its the one thing that we ought to be most anxious to discuss and examine frankly in all its bearingsin order to see if we cant better itbut thats precisely the thing that doesnt get talked about between us
You would never have told me that you were unhappy You use the word again she reminded him a wan smile softening her protest
Thorpe stood up and took a slow step toward the chair
He held her glance with his own as he stood then his head bent gravely regarding her
Do you tell me that you are happy
he asked with sober directness
She fluttered her hands in a little restrained gesture of comment
You consider only the extremes she told him
Between black and white there are so many colours and shades and halftones
The whole spectrum in fact
Hardly anybody I should think gets over the edge into the true black or the true white
There are always tints modifications
People are always inside the colourscheme so to speak
The worst that can be said of me is that I may be in the bluesin the lightbluesbut it is fair to remember that they photograph white
Though there was an impulse within him to resent this as trifling he resisted it and judicially considered her allegory
That is to sayhe began hesitatingly
To the observer I am happy
To myself I am not unhappy
Why wont you tell me Edith just where you are
The sound of her name was somewhat unfamiliar to their discourse
The intonation which his voice gave to it now caused her to look up quickly
If I could tell myself she answered him after an instants thought pray believe that I would tell you
The way seemed for the moment blocked before him and he sighed heavily
I want to get nearer to you he said with gloom and I dont
It occurred to her to remark You take exception to my phraseology when I say you always try to be nice but Im sure you know what I mean
She offered him this assurance with a tentative smile into which he gazed moodily
You didnt think I was nice when you consented to marry me he was suddenly inspired to say
I cant imagine your applying that word to me then in your mind
God knows what it was you did say to yourself about me but you never said I was nice
That was the last word that would have fitted me thenand now its the only one you can think of
The hint that somehow he had stumbled upon a clue to the mysteries enveloping him rose to prominence in his mind as he spoke
The year had wrought a baffling difference in him
He lacked something now that then he had possessed but he was powerless to define it
He seated himself again in the chair and put his hand through her arm to keep her where she lightly rested beside him
Will you tell me he said with a kind of sombre gentleness what the word is that you would have used then
I know you wouldntcouldnthave called me nice
What would you have called me
She paused in silence for a little then slipped from the chair and stood erect still leaving her wrist within the restraining curve of his fingers
I suppose she said musinglyI suppose I should have said powerful or strong
Then she released her arm and in turn moved to the parapet
And I am weak nowI am nice he reflected mechanically
In the profile he saw as she looked away at the vast distant horizon there was something pensive even sad
She did not speak at once and as he gazed at her more narrowly it seemed as if her lips were quivering
A new sense of her great beauty came to himand with it a hint that for the instant at least her guard was down
He sprang to his feet and stood beside her
You ARE going to be open with meEdith
he pleaded softly
She turned from him a little as if to hide the signs of her agitation
Oh what is there to say
she demanded in a tone which was almost a wail
It is not your fault
Im not blaming you
WHAT is not my fault
he persisted with patient gentleness
Suddenly she confronted him
There were the traces of tears upon her lashes and serenity had fled from her face
It is a mistakea blunder she began hurriedly
I take it all upon my own shoulders
I was the one who did it
I should have had more judgmentmore good sense
You are not telling me are you he asked with gravity that you are sorry you married me
Is either of us glad
she retorted breathlessly
What is there to be glad about
You are bored to deathyou confess it
And Iwell it is not what I thought it would be
I deceived myself
I do not reproach you
No you keep saying that he observed with gloomy slowness of utterance
But what is it you reproach yourself with then
We might as well have it out
Yes she assented with a swift reversion to calm
Her eyes met his with a glance which had in it an implacable frankness
I married one man because he would be able to make me a Duchess
I married another because he had eighty thousand a year
That is the kind of beast I am
There is bad blood in me
You know my father that is quite enough
I am his daughter that explains everything
The exaggeration of her tone and words produced a curious effect upon him
He stared at her for a little perceiving slowly that a new personage was being revealed to him
The mask of delicatelybalanced cynicism of amiably polite indifference had been lifted there was a woman of flesh and blood beneath it after alla woman to whom he could talk on terms of intimacy
Rubbish
he said and his big face lightened into a genial paternal smile
You didnt marry me for my money at all
What nonsense
I simply came along and carried you off
You couldnt help yourself
It would have been the same if I hadnt had sixpence
To his sharp scrutiny there seemed to flicker in her eyes a kind of answering gleam
Then she hastily averted her glance and in this action too there was a warrant for his mounting confidence
The trouble has been he declared that Ive been too much afraid of you
Ive thought that you were made of so much finer stuff than I am that you mustnt be touched
That was all a mistake
I see it right enough now
You ARE finer than I amGod knows theres no dispute about thatbut thats no reason why I should have hung up signs of Hands off
all around you and been frightened by them myself
I had the cheek to capture you and carry you offand I ought to have had the pluck to make you love me afterward and keep it up
And thats what Im going to do
To this declaration she offered no immediate reply but continued to gaze with a vaguely meditative air upon the expanse of landscape spread below them
He threw a hasty glance over the windows behind him and then with assurance passed his arm round her waist
He could not say that there was any responsive yielding to his embrace but he did affirm to himself with new conviction as he looked down upon the fair small head at his shoulder with its lovely palebrown hair drawn softly over the temples and its glimpse of the matchless profile inclined beneaththat it was all right
He waited for a long time with a joyous patience for her to speak
The mere fact that she stood beneath his engirdling arm and gave no thought to the potential servantseyes behind them was enough for present happiness
He regarded the illimitable picture commanded from his terrace with refreshed eyes it was once again the finest view in Englandand something much more than that beside
At last abruptly she laughed alouda silvery amused little laugh under her breath
How comedy and tragedy tread forever on each others heels
she remarked
Her tone was philosophically gay but upon reflection he did not wholly like her words
There wasnt any tragedy he said and there isnt any comedy
She laughed again
Oh dont say that this doesnt appeal to your sense of humour
she urged with mock fervour
Thorpe sighed in such unaffected depression at this that she seemed touched by his mood
Without stirring from his hold she lifted her face
Dont think Im hateful she bade him and her eyes were very kind
Theres more truth in what youve been saying than even you imagine
It really wasnt the moneyor I mean it might easily have been the same if there had been no money
But how shall I explain it
I am attracted by a big bold strong pirate let us say but as soon as he has carried me offthat is the phrase for itthen he straightway renounces crime and becomes a lawabiding peaceful citizen
My buccaneer transforms himself under my very eyes into an alderman
Do you say there is no comedy in thatand tragedy too
Oh put it that way and its all right he declared after a moments consideration
Ive got as much fun in me as anybody else he went on only your jokes have a way of raising blisters on me somehow
But thats all done with now
Thats because I didnt know youwas frightened of you
But I aint scared any more
Everything is different
With a certain graciousness of lingering movement she withdrew herself from his clasp and faced him with a doubtful smile
Ah dont be too sure she murmured
Everything is different
he repeated with confident emphasis
Dont you see yourself it is
You say it is she replied hesitatingly but that alone doesnt make it so
The assertion that life isnt empty doesnt fill it
Ah but NOW you will talk with me about all that he broke in triumphantly
Weve been standing off with one another
Weve been of no help to each other
But well change that now
Well talk over everything together
Well make up our minds exactly what we want to do and then Ill tuck you under my arm and well set out and do it
She smiled with kindly tolerance for his newborn enthusiasm
Dont count on me for too much wisdom or invention she warned him
If things are to be done you are still the one who will have to do them
But undoubtedly you are at your best when you are doing things
This really has been no sort of life for you here
He gathered her arm into his
Come and show me your greenhouses he said and began walking toward the end of the terrace
Itll turn out to have been all right for me this year that Ive spent here he continued as they strolled along
There was a delightful consciousness of new intimacy conveyed by the very touch of her arm which filled his tone with buoyancy
Ive been learning all sorts of tricks here and getting myself into your ways of life
Its all been good training
In every way Im a better man than I was
They had descended from the terrace to a garden path and approached now a long glass structure through the panes of which masses of soft colourwhites yellows pinks mauves and strange dull redswere dimly perceptible
The chrysanthemums are not up to much this year Edith observed as they drew near to the door of this house
Collins did them very badlyas he did most other things
But next year it will be very different
Gafferson is the best chrysanthemum man in England
That is he in there now I think
Thorpe stopped short and stared at her the while the suggestions stirred by the sound of this name slowly shaped themselves
Gafferson
he asked her with a blank countenance
My new headgardener she explained
He was at Hadlow and after poor old Lady Plowden diedwhy surely you remember him there
You spoke about himyoud known him somewherein the West Indies wasnt it
He looked into vacancy with the aspect of one stupefied
Did I
he mumbled automatically
Then with sudden decision he swung round on the gravel
Ive got a kind of headache coming on he said
If you dont mind we wont go inside among the flowers
CHAPTER XXVI THORPE walked along in the remoter outoftheway parts of the great gardens as the first shadows of evening began to dull the daylight
For a long time he moved aimlessly about sick at heart and benumbed of mind in the stupid oppression of a bad dream
There ran through all his confused thoughts the exasperating consciousness that it was nonsense to be frightened or even disturbed that in truth nothing whatever had happened
But he could not lay hold of it to any comforting purpose
Some perverse force within him insisted on raising new phantoms in his path and directing his reluctant gaze to their unpleasant shapes
Forgotten terrors pushed themselves upon his recollection
It was as if he stood again in the Board Room with the telegram telling of old Tavenders death in his hands waiting to hear the knock of Scotland Yard upon the door
The coming of Gafferson took on a kind of supernatural aspect when Thorpe recalled its circumstances
His own curious mental ferment which had made this present week a period apart in his life had begun in the very hour of this mans approach to the house
His memory reconstructed a vivid picture of that approachof the old ramshackle village trap and the boy and the bags and the yellow tin trunk and that decent redbearded plebeian figure so commonplace and yet so elusively suggestive of something out of the ordinary
It seemed to him now that he had at the time discerned a certain fateful quality in the apparition
And he and his wife had actually been talking of old Kervick at the moment
It was their disagreement over him which had prevented her explaining about the new headgardener
There was an effect of the uncanny in all this
And what did Gafferson want
How much did he know
The idea that perhaps old Kervick had found him out and patched up with him a scheme of blackmail occurred to him and in the unreal atmosphere of his mood became a thing of substance
With blackmail however one could always deal it was almost a relief to see the complication assume that guise
But if Gafferson was intent upon revenge and exposure instead
With such a sluglike patient tenacious fool was that not more likely
Reasonable arguments presented themselves to his mind ever and again his wife had known of Gaffersons work and thought highly of it and had been in a position to learn of his leaving Hadlow
What more natural than that she should hasten to employ him
And what was it after all that Gafferson could possibly know or prove
His brotherinlaw had gone off and got too drunk to live and had died
What in the name of all that was sensible had this to do with Thorpe
Why should it even be supposed that Gafferson associated Thorpe with any phase of the business
And if he had any notion of a hostile movement why should he have delayed action so long
Why indeed
Reassurance did not come to him but at last an impulse to definite action turned his footsteps toward the cluster of greenhouses in the deepening shadow of the mansion
He would find Gafferson and probe this business to the uttermost
If there was discoverable in the mans manner or glance the least evidence of a malevolent intentionhe would know what to do
Ah what was it that he would do
He could not say beyond that it would be bad for Gafferson
He instinctively clenched the fists in the pockets of his jacket as he quickened his pace
Inside the congeries of glazed houses he was somewhat at sea
It was still light enough to make ones way about in the passages between the stagings but he had no idea of the general plan of the buildings and it seemed to him that he frequently got back to places he had traversed before
There were two or three subordinate gardeners in or about the houses but upon reflection he forbore to question them
He tried to assume an idly indifferent air as he sauntered past nodding almost imperceptible acknowledgment of the forefingers they jerked upward in salutation
He came at last upon a locked door the key of which had been removed
The fact vaguely surprised him and he looked with awakened interest through the panes of this door
The air inside seemed slightly thickenedand then his eye caught the flicker of a flame straight ahead
It was nothing but the fumigation of a house the burning spirits in the lamp underneath the brazier were filling the structure with vapours fatal to all insect life
In two or three hours the men would come and open the doors and windows and ventilate the place
The operation was quite familiar to him it had indeed interested him more when he first saw it done than had anything else connected with the greenhouses
His abstracted gaze happened to take note of the fact that the doorkey was hanging on a nail overhead and then suddenly this seemed to be related to something else in his thoughtssome obscure impression or memory which evaded him
Continuing to look at the key a certain recollection all at once assumed great definiteness in his mind it came to him that the labels on this patent fumigator they were using warned people against exposing themselves to its fumes more than was absolutely necessary
That meant of course that their full force would kill a human being
It was very interesting
He looked through the glass again but could not see that the air was any thicker
The lamp still burned brightly
He turned away and beheld a man in an old cap and apron at the further end of the palmhouse he was in doing something to a plant
Thorpe noted the fact that he felt no surprise in seeing that it was Gafferson
Somehow the sight of the key and of the poisonspreading flame inside the locked door seemed to have prepared him for the spectacle of Gafferson close at hand
He moved forward slowly toward the headgardener and luminous plans rose in his mind readymade at each step
He could strangle this annoying fool or smother him into nonresisting insensibility and then put him inside that deathhouse and let it be supposed that he had been asphyxiated by accident
The men when they came back would find him there
But ah
they would know that they had not left him there they would have seen him outside no doubt after the fire had been lighted
Well the key could be left in the unlocked door
Then it could be supposed that he had rashly entered and been overcome by the vapours
He approached the man silently his brain arranging the details of the deed with calm celerity
Then some objections to the plan rose up before him they dealt almost exclusively with the social nuisance the thing would entail
There was to be a houseparty with that Duke and Duchess in it of whom his wife talked so much and it would be a miserable kind of bore to have a suffocated gardener forced upon them as a principal topic of conversation
Of course too it would more or less throw the whole household into confusion
And its effect upon his wifethe progress of his thoughts was checked abruptly by this suggestion
A vision of the shock such a catastrophe might involve to heror at the best of the gross unpleasantness she would find in itflashed over his mind and then yielded to a softening radiant consciousness of how much this meant to him
It seemed to efface everything else upon the instant
A profoundly tender desire for her happiness was in complete possession
Already the notion of doing anything to wound or grieve her appeared incredible to him
Well Gafferson he heard himself saying in one of the more reserved tones of his patriarchal manner
He had halted close to the inattentive man and stood looking down upon him
His glance was at once tolerant and watchful
Gafferson slowly rose from his slouching posture surveyed the other while his faculties in leisurely fashion worked out the problem of recognition aud then raised his finger to his capbrim
Goodevening sir he said
This gesture of deference was eloquently convincing
Thorpe after an instants alert scrutiny smiled upon him
I was glad to hear that you had come to us he said with benevolent affability
We shall expect great things of a man of your reputation
Itll be a fair comfort sir the other replied to be in a place where what one does is appreciated
What use is it to succeed in hybridizing a Hippeastrum procera with a Pancratium Amancaes after over six hundred attempts in ten years and then spend three years ahandnursing the seedlings and then your master wont take enough interest in the thing to pay your fare up to London to the exhibition with em
Thats what ud break any mans heart
Quite true Thorpe assented with patrician kindliness
You need fear nothing of that sort here Gafferson
We give you a free hand
Whatever you want you have only to let us know
And you cant do things too well to please us
Thank you sir said Gafferson and really as Thorpe thought about it the interview seemed at an end
The master turned upon his heel with a brief oblique nod over his shoulder and made his way out into the open air
Here as he walked he drew a succession of long consolatory breaths
It was almost as if he had emerged from the lethal presence of the fumigator itself
He took the largest cigar from his case lighted it and sighed smokeladen new relief as he strolled back toward the terrace
But a few minutes before he had been struggling helplessly in the coils of an evil nightmare
These terrors seemed infinitely far behind him now
He gave an indifferent parting glance backward at them as one might over his afterbreakfast cigar at the confused alarms of an early awakening hours before
There was nothing worth rememberingonly the shapeless and foolish burden of a bad dream
The assurance rose within him that he was not to have any more such trouble
With a singular clearness of mental vision he perceived that the part of him which brought bad dreams had been sloughed off like a serpents skin
There had been two Thorpes and one of themthe Thorpe who had always been willing to profit by knavery and at last in a splendid coup as a master thief had stolen nearly a million and would have shrunk not at all from adding murder to the rest to protect that plunderthis vicious Thorpe had gone away altogether
There was no longer a place for him in life he would never be seen again by mortal eyeThere remained only the good Thorpe the pleasant wellintentioned opulent gentleman the excellent citizen the beneficent master to whom even Gafferson like the others touched a respectful forelock
It passed in the procession of his reverie as a kind of triumph of virtue that the good Thorpe retained the fortune which the bad Thorpe had stolen
It was in all senses a fortunate fact because now it would be put to worthy uses
Considering that he had but dimly drifted about heretofore on the outskirts of the altruistic impulse it was surprisingly plain to him now that he intended to be a philanthropist
Even as he mentioned the word to himself the possibilities suggested by it expanded in his thoughts
His old dormant formless lust for power stirred again in his pulses
What other phase of power carried with it such rewards such gratitudes such humble subservience on all sides as far as the eye could reachas that exercised by the intelligently munificent philanthropist
Intelligence
that was the note of it all
Many rich people dabbled at the giving of money but they did it so stupidly in such a slipshod fashion that they got no credit for it
Even millionaires more or less in public life great newspaperowners great brewerpeers and the like men who should know how to do things well gave huge sums in bulk for public charities such as the housing of the poor and yet contrived somehow to let the kudos that should have been theirs evaporate
He would make no such mistake as that
It was easy enough to see wherein they erred
They gave superciliously handing down their alms from a top lofty altitude of Tory superiority and the Radicals down below sniffed or growled even while they grudgingly took these giftsthat was all nonsense
These aristocratic or tufthunting philanthropists were the veriest duffers
They laid out millions of pounds in the vain attempt to secure what might easily be had for mere thousands if they went sensibly to work
Their vast benefactions yielded them at the most bare thanks or more often no thanks at all because they lacked the wit to lay aside certain little trivial but annoying pretensions and waive a few empty prejudices
They went on year after year tossing their fortunes into a sink of contemptuous ingratitude wondering feebly why they were not beloved in return
It was because they were fools
They could not or they would not understand the people they sought to manipulate
What could not a man of real brain of real breadth and energy and force of character do in London with two hundred thousand pounds
Why he could make himself master of the town
He could break into fragments the political ascendency of the snob semidetached villa classes in half the Parliamentary divisions they now controlled
He could reverse the partisan complexion of the Metropolitan delegation and lead to Westminster a party of his own a solid phalanx of disciplined men standing for the implacable Democracy of reawakened London
With such a backing he could coerce ministries at will and remake the politics of England
The role of Great Oliver himself was not too hopelessly beyond the scope of such a vision
Thorpe threw his cigarend aside and then noted that it was almost dark
He strode up to the terrace two steps at a time and swung along its length with a vigour and exhilaration of movement he had not known it seemed to him for years
He felt the excitement of a new incentive bubbling in his veins
Her Ladyship is in her sittingroom sir a domestic replied to his enquiry in the hall
The title arrested his attention from some fresh point of view and he pondered it as he made his way along the corridor and knocked at a door
At the sound of a voice he pushed open the door and went in
Lady Cressage looking up noted with aroused interest a marked change in his carriage
He stood aggressively erect his big shoulders squared and his head held high
On his massive face there was the smile at once buoyant and contained of a strong man satisfied with himself
Something impelled her to rise and to put a certain wistfulness of enquiry into her answering smile
Your headache is better then
she asked him
He looked puzzled for a moment then laughed lightly
Ohyes he answered
Advancing he caught her suddenly almost vehemently in his arms aud covered the face that was perforce upturned with kisses
When she was released from this overwhelming embrace and stood panting and flushed regarding him with narrowed intent eyes in which mystification was mellowed by the gleam of notdispleased curiosity he preferred a request which completed her bewilderment
Mrs Thorpe he began with significant deliberation but smiling with his eyes to show the tenderness underlying his wordswould you mind if we didnt dress for dinner this evening and if we dined in the little breakfastroomor here for that matterinstead of the big place
Why not at all if you wish it she answered readily enough but viewing him still with a puzzled glance
Im full of new ideas he explained impulsively impatient of the necessity to arrange a sequence among his thoughts
I see great things ahead
Its all come to me in a minute but I couldnt see it clearer if Id thought it out for a year
Perhaps I was thinking of it all the time and didnt know it
But anyhow I see my way straight ahead
You dont know what it means to me to have something to do
It makes another man of me just to think about it
Another manyes twenty men
Its a thing that can be done and by God
Im going to do it
She beheld in his face as she scrutinized it a stormy glow of the mans native coarse imperious virility reasserting itself through the mask of torpor which this vacuous year had superimposed
The large features were somehow grown larger still they dominated the countenance as rough bold headlands dominate a shore
It was the visage of a conquerorof a man gathering within himself to expend upon his fellows the appetites energies insensibilities audacities of a beast of prey
Her glance fluttered a little and almost quailed before the frank barbarism of power in the look he bent upon her
Then it came to her that something more was to be read in this look there was in it a reservation of magnanimity of protection of entreating invitation for her special self
He might tear down with his claws and pull to pieces and devour others but his mate he would shelter and defend and love with all his strength
An involuntary trembling thrill ran through herand then she smiled up at him
What is it youre going to do
she asked him mechanically
Her mind roved far afield
Rule England
he told her with gravity
For the moment there seemed to her nothing positively incongruous in the statement
To look at him as he loomed before her uplifted by his refreshed and soaring selfconfidence it appeared not easy to say what would be impossible to him
She laughed after a fleeting pause with a plainer note of goodfellowship than he had ever heard in her voice before
Delightful she said gayly
But Im not sure that I quite understand thethe precise connection of morningdress and dinner in a small room with the project
He nodded pleased comprehension of the spirit in which she took him
Just a whim he explained
The things Ive got in mind dont fit at all with ceremony and that big barn of a room and men standing about
What I want more than anything else is a quiet snug little evening with you alone where I can talk to you andand we can be together by ourselves
Youd like it wouldnt you
She hesitated and there was a novel confession of embarrassment in her mantling colour and downspread lashes
It had always to his eyes been from the moment he first beheld it the most beautiful face in the worldexquisitely matchless in its form and delicacy of line and serene yet sensitive grace
But he had not seen in it before or guessed that there could come to it this crowning added loveliness of feminine confusion
You would like it wouldnt you
he repeated in a lower more strenuous tone
She lifted her eyes slowly and looked not into his but over his shoulder as in a reverie half meditation half languorous dreaming
She swayed rather than stepped toward him
I think she answered in a musing murmurI think I shall likeeverything
CHAPTER XXVII THORPE found the Duke of Glastonbury a much more interesting person to watch and to talk with both during the dinner Saturday evening and later than he had anticipated
He was young and slight of frame and not at all imposing in stature but he bore himself with a certain shy courtliness of carriage which had a distinction of its own
His face with its little black moustache and large dark eyes was fine upon examination but in some elusively foreign way
There lingered a foreign note too in the way he talked
His speech was English enough to the ear it was true but it was the considered English of a book and its phrases had a deftness which was hardly native
He looked if not a sad young man then one conscious always of sufficient reasons for sadness but one came after a time to see that the mood beneath was not melancholy
It had even its sprightly side which shone out irregularly in his glance and talk from a sober mean of amiable weariness
Thorpe knew his extraordinary storythat of a poor tutor earning his living in ignorance of the fact that he had a birthright of any sort who had been miraculously translated into the heir not only to an ancient title but to vast collateral wealth
He had been born and reared in France and it was there that the heralds of this stupendous change in his affairs had found him out
There was a good deal more to the story including numerous unsavoury legends about people now many years dead and it was impossible to observe the young Duke and not seem to perceive signs that he was still nervously conscious of these legends
The story of his wifea serene greyeyed rather silent young person with a pale face of some beauty and with much purity and intellectwas strange enough to match
She also had earned her own living as a private secretary or typewriting girl or something of the sort and her husband had deliberately chosen her after he had come into his title
One might study her very closely however and catch no hint that these facts in any degree disconcerted her
Thorpe studied her a good deal in a furtive way with a curiosity born of his knowledge that the Duke had preferred her when he might have married his widowed cousin who was now Thorpes own wife
How he had come to know this he could never have told
He had breathed it in somehow with the gossipladen atmosphere of that one London season of his
It was patent enough too that his wifehis Edithhad not only liked this ducal youngster very much but still entertained toward him a considerable affection
She had never dissembled this feeling and it visibly informed her glance and manner now at her own table when she turned to speak with him where he sat at her right hand
Thorpe had never dreamed of thinking ill of his wifes friendship even when her indifference to what he thought had been most taken for granted
Now that this was all changed and the amazing new glory of a lover had enveloped him he had a distinct delight in watching the myriad charming phases of her kind manner halfsisterly halfmotherly toward the gravefaced young man
It was all a part of the delicious change which these past few days had wrought in her this warm and supple softness of mien of eye and smile and voice
But how the Duke if really he had had a chance to marry Edith could have taken the typewriter instead baffled speculation
Thorpe gave more attention to this problem during dinner than he did to the conversation of the table
His exchange of sporadic remarks with the young Duchess beside him was indeed an openly perfunctory affair which left him abundant leisure to contemplate her profile in silence while she turned to listen to the general talk of which Miss Madden and the Hon
Winifred Plowden bore the chief burden
The talk of these ladies interested him but indifferently though the frequent laughter suggested that it was amusing
He looked from his wife to the Duchess and back again in everrecurring surprise that the coronet had been carried past Edith
And once he looked a long time at his wife and the Duke and formulated the theory that she must have refused him
No doubt that was why she bad been sympathetically fond of him ever since and was being so nice to him now
Yesclearly that was it
He felt upon this that he also liked the Duke very much
It was by no means so apparent that the Duke liked him
Both he and his Duchess indeed were scrupulously and even deferentially polite but there was a painstaking effect about it which seemingly they lacked the art altogether to conceal
It seemed to Thorpe that the other guests unconsciously took their cue from this august couple and all exposed somewhat the effort their civility to him involved
At another time the suspicion of this would have stung him
He had only to glance across the table to where his wife sat now and it was all right
What other people thought of himhow other people liked or disliked himwas of no earthly importance
Whenever he chose to exert himself he could compel from them the behaviour that he desired
It was their dull inability to read character which prompted them to regard him as merely a rich outsider who had married Edith Cressage
He viewed with a comfortable tolerance this infirmity of theirs
When the time came if he wanted to do so he could awaken them to their delusion as by forked lightning and the burst of thunder
The whim came to him and expanded swiftly into a determination to contrive some intimate talk forthwith with the Duke
The young man seemed both clever and sensible and in a way impressionable as well
Thorpe thought that he would probably have some interesting things to say but still more he thought of him as a likely listener
It would be the easier to detach him from the company since the occasion was one of studied informality
The Duke did not go about in society in the ordinary sense of the word and he would not have come to High Thorpe to meet a large party
He was here as a kinsman and friend of his hostess for a quiet week and the few other guests fitted readily enough into the picture of a family gathering
The spirit of domesticity had indeed so obviously descended upon the little group in the drawingroom an hour or so after dinner that Thorpe felt it quite the natural thing to put his arm through that of the Duke and lead him off to his personal smokingroom
He even published his intention by audibly bidding the Hon
Balder Plowden to remain with the ladies
When the two had seated themselves in soft low easychairs and the host had noted with pleasure that his guest had no effeminate qualms in the matter of large rich cigars a brief silence ensued
I am very anxious to get your views on a certain subject Thorpe was inspired to begin bluntly pushing preliminaries aside
If a man of fortune wishes to do genuine good with his money here in England how should he best go about it
The Duke looked up at his questioner with a sudden flash of surprise on his dark mobile face
He hesitated a moment and smiled a little
You ask of me the sum of human wisdom he said
It is the hardest of all problems no one solves it
Thorpe nodded his big head comprehendingly
Thats all the more reason why it ought to be solved he declared with slow emphasis
The other expressed by look and tone an augmented consciousness of the unexpected
I did not know he remarked cautiously that this was a matter in which you were specially concerned
It pleases me very much to hear it
Even if the solution does not come it is well to have as many as possible turning the problem over in their minds
Oh but Im going to solve it
Thorpe told him with round confidence
The Duke pulled contemplatively at his cigar for a little
Do not think me a cynic he began at last
You are a man of affairs you have made your own way you should be even more free from illusions than I am
If you tell me that these good things can be done I am the last one to dispute you
But I have seen near at hand experiments of exceptional importance on a very grand scale and the result does not encourage me
I come to doubt indeed if money has any such power in these affairs as we think it hasfor that matter if it has any power at all
The shifting of money can always disorganize what is going on at the moment change it about and alter it in many waysbut its effect is only temporary
As soon as the pressure is released the human atoms rearrange themselves as they were before and the old conditions return
I think the only force which really makes any permanent difference is characterand yet about even that I am not sure
The best man I have ever knownand in many respects the ablestdevoted untold energy and labour and much money too to the service of a few thousand people in Somerset on land of his own upon a theory wonderfully elaborated and worked out
Perhaps you have heard of Emanuel Torr and his colony his System
Thorpe shook his head
He had worked tremendously for years at it
He fell ill and went awayand in a day all the results of his labours and outlay were flat on the ground
The property is mine now and it is farmed and managed again in the ordinary way and really the people there seem already to have forgotten that they had a prophet among them
The marvelous character of the manyou look in vain for any sign of an impress that it left upon them
I never go there
I cannot bear those people
I have sometimes the feeling that if it were feasible I should like to oppress them in some wayto hurt them
Oh
the people are hogs right enough Thorpe commented genially but they ARE the people and theyre the only tools weve got to work with to make the world go round
But if you leave the world alone objected the Duke it goes round of itself
And if you dont leave it alone it goes round just the same without any reference whatever to your exertions
Some few men are always cleverer or noisier or more restless than the others and their activity produces certain deviations and peculiarities in their generation
The record of thesegenerally a very faulty and foolish recordwe call history
We say of these movements in the past that some of them were good and some were bad
Our sons very likely will differ totally from us about which were good and which were bad quite possibly in turn their sons may agree with us
I do not see that it matters
We cannot treat anything as finalexcept that the world goes round
We appear out of the darkness at one edge of it we are carried across and pitched off into the darkness at the other edge of it
We are certain about nothing else
Except that some of us have to pay for our ride and others dont put in Thorpe
The tone in which he spoke made his meaning so clear that his Grace sat up
Ah you think we do not pay
he queried his countenance brightening with the animation of debate
My dear sir we pay more than anyone else
Our fares are graduated just as our deathduties are
No doubt there are some idle and stupid thickskinned rich fellows who escape the ticketcollector
But for each of them there are a thousand idle poor fellows who do the same
You for example are a man of large wealth
I for my sins carry upon my back the burden of a prodigious fortune
Could we not go out now and walk down the road to your nearest village and find in the pub
there a dozen daylabourers happier than we are
Whyit is Saturday night
Then I will not say a dozen but as many as the tap will hold
It is not the beer alone that makes them happy
Do not think that
It is the ability to rest untroubled the sense that till Monday they have no more responsibility than a treetoad
Does the coming of Sunday make that difference to you or to me
When night comes does it mean to us that we are to sleep off into oblivion all we have done that day and begin life afresh next morning
Noo
We are the tired people the load is never lifted from our backs
Ah do we not pay indeed
Ohho
ejaculated Thorpe
He had been listening with growing astonishment to the others confession
He was still surprised as he spoke but a note of satisfaction mounted into his voice as he went on
You are unhappy too
You are a young man in excellent health you have the wife you want you understand good tobacco you have a son
That is a great dealbut my God
think what else youve got
Youre the Duke of Glastonburyone of the oldest titles in England
Youre one of the richest men in the countrythe richest in the old peerage at any rate Im told
And YOURE not happy
The other smiled
Ah the terms and forms survive he said with a kind of pedagogic affability after the substance has disappeared
The nobleman the prince was a great person in the times when he monopolized wealth
It enabled him to monopolize almost everything else that was pleasant or superb
He had the arts and the books and the musicians and the silks and velvets and the bathtubseverything that made existence gorgeousall to himself
He had war to amuse himself with and the seven deadly sins
The barriers are down now
Everything which used to be exclusively the noblemans is now within everybodys reach including the sins
And it is not only that others have levelled up to him they have levelled him down
He cannot dress now more expensively than other people
Gambling used to be recognized as one of his normal relaxations but now the higher his rank the more sharply he is scolded for it
Naturally he does not know what to do with himself
As an institution he descends from a period when the only imaginable use for wealth was to be magnificent with it
But now in this business age where the recognized use of wealth is to make more wealth he is so much out of place that he has even forgotten how to be magnificent
There are some illustrated articles in one of the magazines giving photographs of the great historic countryhouses of England
You should see the pictures of the interiors
The furniture and decorations are precisely what a Brixton dressmaker would buy if she suddenly came into some money
All the same Thorpe stuck to his point you are not happy
The Duke frowned faintly as if at the others persistency
Then he shrugged his shoulders and answered in a lighter tone
It hardly amounts to that I think
I confess that there are alleviations to my lot
In the opinion of the world I am one of its most fortunate citizensand it is not for me to say that the world is altogether wrong
The chief point isI dont know if you will quite follow methere are limits to what position and fortune can give a man
And so easily they may deprive him of pleasures which poorer men enjoy
I may be wrong but it seems impossible to me that any rich man who has acres of gardens and vineries and glass can get up the same affection for it all that the cottager will have for his little flowerplot that he tends with his own hands
One seems outside the realities of lifea mere spectator at the show
Ah but why not DO things
Thorpe demanded of him
Why merely stand as you say and look on
The other leant his head back again
Pray what do you recommend
he asked almost listlessly
Whypolitics for example
The Duke nodded with an air of according to the suggestion a certain respect
Unhappily I am too much of a foreigner he commented
I know Englishmen and their affairs too imperfectly
Sometimeperhaps
And philanthropic workyou dont care about that pursued the other
Ohwe go not so far as that said his Grace with a deprecatory wave of the hands
My wife finds many interests in it only she would not like to have you call it philanthropical
She is Londonborn and it is a great pleasure to her to be of assistance to poorer young women in London who have so little done for them by the community and can do so little for themselves
I am much less skeptical about that particular work I may tell you than about philanthropy in general
In fact I am quite clear that it is doing good
At least it is doing a kindness and that is a pleasant occupation
We are really not so idle as one might think
We work at it a good deal my wife and I
So am I Londonborn Thorpe remarked with a certain irrelevancy
After a moments pause he turned a sharply enquiring glance upon his guest
This thing that youre doing in Londondoes it give you any pull there
Pull
repeated the other helplessly
If there was something you wanted the people of London to do would they do it for you because of what youve been doing for themor for their girls
The Duke looked puzzled for a moment
But it isnt conceivable that I should want London to do anything unless it might be to consume its own smoke he observed
Quite so
said Thorpe rising bulkily to his feet but signifying by a gesture that his companion was to remain seated
He puffed at his cigar till its tip gleamed angrily through the smoke about him and moved a few steps with his hands in his pockets
That is what I wanted to get at
Now Im Londonborn Ive got the town in my blood
The Thorpes have been booksellers there for generations
The old name is over the old shop still
I think I know what Londoners are like I ought to
Its my belief that they dont want gifts
Theyll take em but it isnt what they want
Theyre a trading peopleone of the oldest in the world
Commercial traditions the merchants pridethese are bred in their bones
They dont want something for nothing
They like an honest bargainfair on both sides
You help me and Ill help you
And its the only way you can do anything worth doing
Well said the Duke passively
Thorpe halted and still with the cigar between his teeth looked down at him
I can go into London and study out the things that are to be donethat need to be doneand divide these into two parts those that belong to private enterprise and those that ought to be done publicly
And I can say to Londonersnot in so many words mind you but in a way the sharper ones will understand Here you fellows
Ill begin doing out of my own pocket one set of these things and you in turn must put yourselves at my back and stand by me and put me in a position where I can make the Government do this other set of things
That will appeal to them
A poor man couldnt lead them any distance because he could always be killed by the cry that he was filling his pockets
They will believe in a man whose ambition is to win an earldom and five thousand a year out of politics but they will stone to death the man who merely tries to get a few hundreds a year out of it for his wife and children
And a man like you cant do anything in London because they cant see that theres anything you want in returnand besides in their hearts they dont like your class
Dont forget it
This is the city that chopped off the kings head
Ah but this is also the city retorted the other with placid pleasure in his argument which decked itself in banners and ribbons to welcome back the son of that same king
And if you think of it he was rather a quaint thing in sons too
It was the women did that Thorpe affirmed with readiness
They get their own way once in a while when the men are tired out and they have their little spell of nonsense and monkeyshines but it never lasts long
Charles II
doesnt matter at allbut take my word for it his father matters a great deal
There was a Thorpe among the judges who voted to behead him
I am descended in a straight line from him
His Grace shrugged his slight shoulders again
It happens that my ancestors had extremely large facilities for doing unpleasant things and God knows they did thembut I dont quite see what that goes to prove now
No you dont grasp the idea said Thorpe resignedly
After a moments pause he took the cigar from his lips and straightened himself All the same he declared roundly I am going to do the trick
London has been waiting for an organizera leaderfor a hundred years
The right kind of a man going the right way to work can stand London on its head as surely as I can burn this cigar
And Im going to have a try at it
It is very interesting remarked the Duke with vagueness
Butare the ladies waiting for us
And if so arent we keeping them up unconscionably
As if in comment upon his words there was the sound of a faint rap at the door
Then it opened and through the dense blue haze of the room they saw some shadowed forms softly indistinct save where the light from the ceiling outside shone down upon a group of coiffured heads
A noise of mingled coughing and laughter specifically completed the introduction
Oh Imits unendurable in there spoke the voice of the hostess
We WERE coming in to smoke with you she called out through the cloud since you wouldnt stop with us
Come along
answered Thorpe cheerily
He strode to the end of the room and raised a window
From the same corner he turned on some added lights
Under this more effective illumination the lady of the house advanced with Miss Madden and the Hon
Winifred close behind her
Frank has gone to bed she explained to the Duke who had risen
Then she turned to her husband a brighteyed glance  You dont mindour coming
she asked
Mind
he called out with robust impressiveness
Mind
As if to complete the expression of his meaning he threw his arm loosely about her where she stood and brought her to his side
They remained standing thus before the fireplace after the others were all seated
Mr Thorpe has been outlining to me the most wonderful plans said the Duke looking from one face to another with a reserved smile
It seems that philanthropy fails unless it is combined with very advanced politics
It is a new idea to mebut he certainly states it with vigour
Do you understand it Edith
Oh perfectly replied the wife smilingly
I am his first convert
Behold in me the original disciple
The worst of that is commented Thorpe with radiant joviality she would subscribe to any other new doctrine of mine just as readily
He tightened the arm encircling her by a perceptible trifle
Wouldnt you sweetheart
he demanded
She seemed in nowise embarrassed by these overt endearments
There was indeed the dimmest suggestion in her face and voice of a responsive mood
Really she began with a soft glance halfdeprecation halfpride bent upon the others and with thoughtful deliberationreally the important thing is that he should pursue some objecthave in view something that he is determined to master
Without that he is not contentednot at his best
He should have been a soldier
He has a passion for battle in his blood
And now that he sees something he is eager to doI am very glad
It makes it none the less acceptable that good is to come from it
I still maintain said Miss Madden interpolating her words through the task of lighting a cigarette and contriving for them an effect of drollery which appealed to Thorpe most of allI shall always insist just the same that crime was his true vocation
