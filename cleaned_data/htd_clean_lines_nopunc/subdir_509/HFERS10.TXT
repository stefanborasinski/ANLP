THROUGH THE GAP When thistles go adrift the sun sets down the valley between the hills when snow comes it goes down behind the Cumberland and streams through a great fissure that people call the Gap
Then the last light drenches the parsons cottage under Imboden Hill and leaves an afterglow of glory on a majestic heap that lies against the east
Sometimes it spans the Gap with a rainbow
Strange people and strange tales come through this Gap from the Kentucky hills
Through it came these two late one daya man and a woman afoot
I met them at the foot bridge over Roaring Fork
Is thar a preacher anywhar aroun hyeh
he asked
I pointed to the cottage under Imboden Hill
The girl flushed slightly and turned her head away with a rather unhappy smile
Without a word the mountaineer led the way towards town
A moment more and a halfbreed Malungian passed me on the bridge and followed them
At dusk the next day I saw the mountaineer chopping wood at a shanty under a clump of rhododendron on the riverbank
The girl was cooking supper inside
The day following he was at work on the railroad and on Sunday after church I saw the parson
The two had not been to him
Only that afternoon the mountaineer was on the bridge with another woman hideously rouged and with scarlet ribbons fluttering from her bonnet
Passing on by the shanty I saw the Malungian talking to the girl
She apparently paid no heed to him until just as he was moving away he said something mockingly and with a nod of his head back towards the bridge
She did not look up even then but her face got hard and white and looking back from the road I saw her slipping through the bushes into the dry bed of the creek to make sure that what the halfbreed told her was true
The two men were working side by side on the railroad when I saw them again but on the first payday the doctor was called to attend the Malungian whose head was split open with a shovel
I was one of two who went out to arrest his assailant and I had no need to ask who he was
The mountaineer was a devil the foreman said and I had to club him with a pistolbutt before he would give in
He said he would get even with me but they all say that and I paid no attention to the threat
For a week he was kept in the calaboose and when I passed the shanty just after he was sent to the countyseat for trial I found it empty
The Malungian too was gone
Within a fortnight the mountaineer was in the door of the shanty again
Having no accuser he had been discharged
He went back to his work and if he opened his lips I never knew
Every day I saw him at work and he never failed to give me a surly look
Every dusk I saw him in his doorway waiting and I could guess for what
It was easy to believe that the stern purpose in his face would make its way through space and draw her to him again
And she did come back one day
I had just limped down the mountain with a sprained ankle
A crowd of women was gathered at the edge of the woods looking with all their eyes to the shanty on the riverbank
The girl stood in the doorway
The mountaineer was coming back from work with his face down
He haint seed her yit said one
Hes goin to kill her shore
I tol her he would
She said she reckoned he would but she didnt keer
For a moment I was paralyzed by the tragedy at hand
She was in the door looking at him when he raised his head
For one moment he stood still staring and then he started towards her with a quickened step
I started too then every step a torture and as I limped ahead she made a gesture of terror and backed into the room before him
The door closed and I listened for a pistolshot and a scream
It must have been done with a knife I thought and quietly for when I was within ten paces of the cabin he opened the door again
His face was very white he held one hand behind him and he was nervously fumbling at his chill with the other
As he stepped towards me I caught the handle of a pistol in my side pocket and waited
He looked at me sharply
Did you say the preacher lived up thar
he asked
Yes I said breathlessly
In the doorway just then stood the girl with a bonnet in her hand and at a nod from him they started up the hill towards the cottage
They came down again after a while he stalking ahead and she after the mountain fashion behind
And after this fashion I saw them at sunset next day pass over the bridge and into the mouth of the Gap whence they came
Through this Gap come strange people and strange tales from the Kentucky hills
Over it sometimes is the span of a rainbow

GRAYSONS BABY The first snow sifted in through the Gap that night and in a shack of one room and a low loft a man was dead a woman was sick to death and four children were barely alive and nobody even knew
For they were hill people who sicken suffer and sometimes die like animals and make no noise
Grayson the Virginian coming down from the woods that morning saw the bighearted little doctor outside the door of the shack walking up and down with his hands in his pockets
He was whistling softly when Grayson got near and without stopping pointed with his thumb within
The oldest boy sat stolidly on the one chair in the room his little brother was on the floor hard by and both were hugging a greasy stove
The little girl was with her mother in the bed both almost out of sight under a heap of quilts
The baby was in a cradle with its face uncovered whether dead or asleep Grayson could not tell
A pine coffin was behind the door
It would not have been possible to add to the disorder of the room and the atmosphere made Grayson gasp
He came out looking white
The first man to arrive thereafter took away the eldest boy a woman picked the baby girl from the bed and a childless young couple took up the pallid little fellow on the floor
These were stepchildren
The baby boy that was left was the womans own
Nobody came for that and Grayson went in again and looked at it a long while
So little so old a human face he had never seen
The brow was wrinkled as with centuries of pain and the little drawn mouth looked as though the spirit within had fought its inheritance without a murmur and would fight on that way to the end
It was the pluck of the face that drew Grayson
Ill take it he said
The doctor was not without his sense of humor even then but he nodded
Cradle and all he said gravely
And Grayson put both on one shoulder and walked away
He had lost the power of giving further surprise in that town and had he met every man he knew not one of them would have felt at liberty to ask him what he was doing
An hour later the doctor found the child in Graysons room and Grayson still looking at it
Is it going to live doctor
The doctor shook his head
Doubtful
Look at the color
Its starved
Theres nothing to do but to watch it and feed it
You can do that
So Grayson watched it with a fascination of which he was hardly conscious
Never for one instant did its look changethe quiet unyielding endurance that no faith and no philosophy could ever bring to him
It was ideal courage that look to accept the inevitable but to fight it just that way
Half the little mountain town was talking next daythat such a tragedy was possible by the public roadside with relief within sound of the babys cry
The oldest boy was least starved
Might made right in an extremity like his and the boy had taken care of himself
The young couple who had the second lad in charge said they had been wakened at daylight the next morning by some noise in the room
Looking up they saw the little fellow at the fireplace breaking an egg
He had built a fire had got eggs from the kitchen and was cooking his breakfast
The little girl was mischievous and cheery in spite of her bad plight and nobody knew of the baby except Grayson and the doctor
Grayson would let nobody else in
As soon as it was well enough to be peevish and to cry he took it back to its mother who was still abed
A long dark mountaineer was there of whom the woman seemed half afraid
He followed Grayson outside
Say podner he said with an unpleasant smile ye dont go up to Crackers Neck fer nothin do ye
The woman had lived at Crackers Neck before she appeared at the Gap and it did not come to Grayson what the man meant until he was halfway to his room
Then he flushed hot and wheeled back to the cabin but the mountaineer was gone
Tell that fellow he had better keep out of my way he said to the woman who understood and wanted to say something but not knowing how nodded simply
In a few days the other children went back to the cabin and day and night Grayson went to see the child until it was out of danger and afterwards
It was not long before the women in town complained that the mother was ungrateful
When they sent things to eat to her the servant brought back word that she had called out  Set them over thar without so much as a thanky
One message was that she didn want no secondhand victuals from nobodys table
Somebody suggested sending the family to the poorhouse
The mother said shed go out on her crutches and hoe corn fust and that the people who talked bout sendin her to the pohouse had better save their breath to make prayers with
One day she was hired to do some washing
The mistress of the house happened not to rise until ten oclock
Next morning the mountain woman did not appear until that hour
She wasnt goin to work a lick while that woman was alayin in bed she said frankly
And when the lady went down town she too disappeared
Nor would she she explained to Grayson while that woman was astruttin the streets
After that one by one they let her alone and the woman made not a word of complaint
Within a week she was working in the fields when she should have been back in bed
The result was that the child sickened again
The old look came back to its face and Grayson was there night and day
He was having trouble out in Kentucky about this time and he went to the Blue Grass pretty often
Always however he left money with me to see that the child was properly buried if it should die while he was gone and once he telegraphed to ask how it was
He said he was sometimes afraid to open my letters for fear that he should read that the baby was dead
The child knew Graysons voice his step
It would go to him from its own mother
When it was sickest and lying torpid it would move the instant he stepped into the room and when he spoke would hold out its thin arms without opening its eyes and for hours Grayson would walk the floor with the troubled little baby over his shoulder
I thought several times it would die when on one trip Grayson was away for two weeks
One midnight indeed I found the mother moaning and three female harpies about the cradle
The baby was dying this time and I ran back for a flask of whiskey
Ten minutes late with the whiskey that night would have been too late
The baby got to know me and my voice during that fortnight but it was still in danger when Grayson got back and we went to see it together
It was very weak and we both leaned over the cradle from either side and I saw the pity and affectionyes hungry halfshamed affectionin Graysons face
The child opened its eyes looked from one to the other and held out its arms to ME
Grayson should have known that the child forgotthat it would forget its own mother
He turned sharply and his face was a little pale
He gave something to the woman and not till then did I notice that her soft black eyes never left him while he was in the cabin
The child got well but Grayson never went to the shack again and he said nothing when I came in one night and told him that some mountaineer a long dark fellowhad taken the woman the children and the household gods of the shack back into the mountains
They dont grieve long I said these people
But long afterwards I saw the woman again along the dusty road that leads into the Gap
She had heard over in the mountains that Grayson was dead and had walked for two days to learn if it was true
I pointed back towards Bee Rock and told her that he had fallen from a cliff back there
She did not move nor did her look change
Moreover she said nothing and being in a hurry I had to ride on
At the footbridge over Roaring Fork I looked back
The woman was still there under the hot midday sun and in the dust of the road motionless

THE SENATORS LAST TRADE A drove of lean cattle were swinging easily over Black Mountain and behind them came a big man with wild black hair and a bushy beard
Now and then he would gnaw at his mustache with his long yellow teeth or would sit down to let his lean horse rest and would flip meaninglessly at the bushes with a switch
Sometimes his bushy head would droop over on his breast and he would snap it up sharply and start painfully on
Robber cattlethief outlaw he might have been in another century for he filled the figure of any robber hero in life or romance and yet he was only the Senator from Bell as he was known in the little Kentucky capital or as he was known in his mountain home just the Senator who had toiled and schemed and grown rich and grown poor who had suffered long and was kind
Only that Christmas he had gutted every store in town
Give me everything you have brother he said across each counter and next day every man woman and child in the mountain town had a present from the Senators hands
He looked like a brigand that day as he looked now but he called every man his brother and his eye while black and lustreless as night was as brooding and just as kind
When the boom went down with it and with everybody else went the Senator
Slowly he got dusty ragged long of hair
He looked tortured and everrestless
You never saw him still always he swept by you flapping his legs on his lean horse or his arms in his rickety buggy here there everywhere turning twisting fighting his way back to freedomand not a murmur
Still was every man his brother and if some forgot his once open hand he forgot it no more completely than did the Senator
He went very far to pay his debts
He felt honor bound indeed to ask his sister to give back the farm that he had given her which very properly people said she declined to do
Nothing could kill hope in the Senators breast he would hand back the farm in another year he said but the sister was firm and without a word still the Senator went other ways and schemed through the nights and worked and rode and walked and traded through the days until now when the light was beginning to glimmer his end was come
This was the Senators last trade and in sight down in a Kentucky valley was home
Strangely enough the Senator did not care at all and he had just enough sanity left to wonder why and to be worried
It was the walking typhoid that had caught up with him and he was listless and he made strange gestures and did foolish things as he stumbled down the mountain
He was going over a little knoll now and he could see the creek that ran around his house but he was not touched
He would just as soon have lain down right where he was or have turned around and gone back except that it was hot and he wanted to get to the water
He remembered that it was nigh Christmas he saw the snow about him and the cakes of ice in the creek
He knew that he ought not to be hot and yet he wasso hot that he refused to reason with himself even a minute and hurried on
It was odd that it should be so but just about that time over in Virginia a cattle dealer nearing home stopped to tell a neighbor how he had tricked some blackwhiskered fool up in the mountains
It may have been just when he was laughing aloud over there that the Senator over here tore his woollen shirt from his great hairy chest and rushed into the icy stream clapping his arms to his burning sides and shouting in his frenzy
If he had lived a little longer said a constituent he would have lost the next election
He hadnt the money you know
If he had lived a little longer said the mountain preacher high up on Yellow Creek Id have got that trade I had on hand with him through
Not that I wanted him to die but if he had towhy If he had lived a little longer said the Senators lawyer he would have cleaned off the score against him
If he had lived a little longer said the Senators sister not meaning to be unkind he would have got all I have
That was what life held for the Senator

A PURPLE RHODODENDRON The purple rhododendron is rare
Up in the Gap here Bee Rock hung out over Roaring Rock blossoms with itas a gray cloud purples with the sunrise
This rock was tossed lightly on edge when the earth was young and stands vertical
To get the flowers you climb the mountain to one side and balancing on the rocks thin edge slip down by roots and past rattlesnake dens till you hang out over the water and reach for them
To avoid snakes it is best to go when it is cool at daybreak
I know but one other place in this southwest corner of Virginia where there is another bush of purple rhododendron and one bush only is there
This hangs at the throat of a peak not far away whose ageless gray head is bent over a ravine that sinks like a spear thrust into the side of the mountain
Swept only by high wind and eagle wings as this is I yet knew one man foolhardy enough to climb to it for a flower
He brought one blossom down and to this day I do not know that it was not the act of a coward yes though Grayson did it actually smiling all the way from peak to ravine and though he was my best friend best loved then and since
I believe he was the strangest man I have ever known and I say this with thought for his eccentricities were sincere
In all he did I cannot remember having even suspected anything theatrical but once
We were all Virginians or Kentuckians at the Gap and Grayson was a Virginian
You might have guessed that he was a Southerner from his voice and from the way he spoke of women but no more
Otherwise he might have been a Moor except for his color which was about the only racial characteristic he had
He had been educated abroad and after the English habit had travelled everywhere
And yet I can imagine no more lonely way between the eternities than the path Grayson trod alone
He came to the Gap in the early days and just why he came I never knew
He had studied the iron question a long time he told me and what I thought reckless speculation was it seems deliberate judgment to him
His money in the dirt as the phrase was Grayson got him a horse and rode the hills and waited
He was intimate with nobody
Occasionally he would play poker with us and sometimes he drank a good deal but liquor never loosed his tongue
At poker his face told as little as the back of his cards and he won more than admirationeven from the Kentuckians who are artists at the game but the money went from a free hand and after a diversion like this he was apt to be moody and to keep more to himself than ever
Every fortnight or two he would disappear always over Sunday
In three or four days he would turn up again black with brooding and then he was the last man to leave the cardtable or he kept away from it altogether
Where he went nobody knew and he was not the man anybody would question
One night two of us Kentuckians were sitting in the club and from a home paper I read aloud the rumored engagement of a girl we both knew who was famous for beauty in the Bluegrass as was her mother before her and the mother before herto an unnamed Virginian
Grayson sat near smoking a pipe and when I read the girls name I saw him take the meerschaum from his lips and I felt his eyes on me
It was a mystery how but I knew at once that Grayson was the man
He sought me out after that and seemed to want to make friends
I was willing or rather he made me more than willing for he was irresistible to me as I imagine he would have been to anybody
We got to walking together and riding together at night and we were soon rather intimate but for a long time he never so much as spoke the girls name
Indeed he kept away from the Bluegrass for nearly two months but when he did go he stayed a fortnight
This time he came for me as soon as he got back to the Gap
It was just before midnight and we went as usual back of Imboden Hill through moon dappled beeches and Grayson turned off into the woods where there was no path both of us silent
We rode through tremulous shining leaves Graysons horse choosing a way for himselfand threshing through a patch of high strong weeds we circled past an amphitheatre of deadened trees whose crooked arms were tossed out into the moonlight and halted on the spur
The moon was poised over Morriss farm South Fork was shining under us like a loop of gold the mountains lay about in tranquil heaps and the moonmist rose luminous between them
There Grayson turned to me with an eager light in his eyes that I had never seen before
This has a new beauty tonight
he said and then I told her about you and she said that she used to know youwell
I was glad my face was in shadowI could hardly keep back a brutal laughand Grayson unseeing went on to speak of her as I had never heard any man speak of any woman
In the end he said that she had just promised to be his wife
I answered nothing
Other men I knew had said that with the same right perhaps and had gone from her to go back no more
And I was one of them
Grayson had met her at White Sulphur five years before and had loved her ever since
She had known it from the first he said and I guessed then what was going to happen to him
I marvelled listening to the man for it was the star of constancy in her white soul that was most lustrous to himand while I wondered the marvel became a commonplace
Did not every lover think his loved one exempt from the frailty that names other women
There is no ideal of faith or of purity that does not live in countless women today
I believe that but could I not recall one friend who walked with Divinity through pine woods for one immortal spring and who being sick to death was quite finished learning her at last
Did I not know lovers who believed sacred to themselves in the name of love lips that had been given to many another without it
And now did I not knowbut I knew too much and to Grayson I said nothing
That spring the boom came
Graysons property quadrupled in value and quadrupled again
I was his lawyer and I plead with him to sell but Grayson laughed
He was not speculating he had invested on judgment he would sell only at a certain figure
The figure was actually reached and Grayson let half go
The boom fell and Grayson took the tumble with a jest
It would come again in the autumn he said and he went off to meet the girl at White Sulphur
I worked right hard that summer but I missed him and I surely was glad when he came back
Something was wrong I saw it at once
He did not mention her name and for a while he avoided even me
I sought him then and gradually I got him into our old habit of walking up into the Gap and of sitting out after supper on a big rock in the valley listening to the run of the river and watching the afterglow over the Cumberland the moon rise over Wallens Ridge and the stars come out
Waiting for him to speak I learned for the first time then another secret of his wretched melancholy
It was the hopelessness of that time perhaps that disclosed it
Grayson had lost the faith of his childhood
Most men do that at some time or other but Grayson had no business no profession no art in which to find relief
Indeed there was but one substitute possible and that came like a gift straight from the God whom he denied
Love came and Graysons ideals of love as of everything else were morbid and quixotic
He believed that he owed it to the woman he should marry never to have loved another
He had loved but one woman he said and he should love but one
I believed him then literally when he said that his love for the Kentucky girl was his religion nowthe only anchor left him in his sea of troubles the only star that gave him guiding light
Without this love what then
I had a strong impulse to ask him but Grayson shivered as though he divined my thought and in some relentless way our talk drifted to the question of suicide
I was not surprised that he rather defended it
Neither of us said anything new only I did not like the way he talked
He was too deliberate too serious as though he were really facing a possible fact
He had no religious scruples he said no family ties he had nothing to do with bringing himself into life whyif it was not worth living not bearable why should he not end it
He gave the usual authority and I gave the usual answer
Religion aside if we did not know that we were here for some purpose we did not know that we were not and here we were anyway and our duty was plain
Desertion was the act of a coward and that Grayson could not deny
That autumn the crash of 91 came across the water from England and Grayson gave up
He went to Richmond and came back with money enough to pay off his notes and I think it took nearly all he had
Still he played poker steadily nowfor poker had been resumed when it was no longer possible to gamble in lotshe drank a good deal and he began just at this time to take a singular interest in our volunteer police guard
He had always been on hand when there was trouble and I shant soon forget him the day Senator Mahone spoke when we were punching a crowd of mountaineers back with cocked Winchesters
He had lost his hat in a struggle with one giant he looked half crazy with anger and yet he was white and perfectly cool and I noticed that he never had to tell a man but once to stand back
Now he was the first man to answer a police whistle
When we were guarding Talt Hall he always volunteered when there was any unusual risk to run
When we raided the Pound to capture a gang of desperadoes he insisted on going ahead as spy and when we got restless lying out in the woods waiting for daybreak and the captain suggested a charge on the cabin Grayson was by his side when it was made
Grayson sprang through the door first and he was the man who thrust his reckless head up into the loft and lighted a match to see if the murderers were there
Most of us did foolish things in those days under stress of excitement but Grayson I saw was weak enough to be reckless
His trouble with the girl whatever it was was serious enough to make him apparently care little whether he were alive or dead
And still I saw that not yet even had he lost hope
He was having a sore fight with his pride and he got body worn and heartsick over it
Of course he was worsted and in the end from sheer weakness he went back to her once more
I shall never see another face like his when Grayson came back that last time
I never noticed before that there were silver hairs about his temples
He stayed in his room and had his meals sent to him
He came out only to ride and then at night
Waking the third morning at daybreak I saw him through the window galloping past and I knew he had spent the night on Black Mountain
I went to his room as soon as I got up and Grayson was lying across his bed with his face down his clothes on and in his right hand was a revolver
I reeled into a chair before I had strength enough to bend over him and when I did I found him asleep
I left him as he was and I never let him know that I had been to his room but I got him out on the rock again that night and I turned our talk again to suicide
I said it was small mean cowardly criminal contemptible
I was savagely in earnest and Grayson shivered and said not a word
I thought he was in better mind after that
We got to taking night rides again and I stayed as closely to him as I could for times got worse and trouble was upon everybody
Notes fell thicker than snowflakes and through the foolish policy of the company foreclosures had to be made
Grayson went to the wall like the rest of us
I asked him what he had done with the money he had made
He had given away a great deal to poorer kindred he had paid his dead fathers debts he had played away a good deal and he had lost the rest
His faith was still imperturbable
He had a dozen rectangles of dirt and from these he said it would all come back some day
Still he felt the sudden poverty keenly but he faced it as he did any other physical fact in lifedauntless
He used to be fond of saying that no one thing could make him miserable
But he would talk with mocking earnestness about some much dreaded combination and a favorite phrase of hiswhich got to have peculiar significancewas the cohorts of hell who closed in on him when he was sick and weak and who fell back when he got well
He had one strange habit too from which I got comfort
He would deliberately walk into and defy any temptation that beset him
That was the way he strengthened himself he said
I knew what his temptation was now and I thought of this habit when I found him asleep with his revolver and I got hope from it now when the dreaded combination whatever that was seemed actually to have come
I could see now that he got worse daily
He stopped his mockeries his occasional fits of reckless gayety
He stopped pokerresolutelyhe couldnt afford to lose now and what puzzled me he stopped drinking
The man simply looked tired always hopelessly tired and I could believe him sincere in all his foolish talk about his blessed Nirvana which was the peace he craved which was end enough for him
Winter broke
May drew near and one afternoon when Grayson and I took our walk up through the Gap he carried along a huge spyglass of mine which had belonged to a famous old desperado who watched his enemies with it from the mountaintops
We both helped capture him and I defended him
He was sentenced to hangthe glass was my fee
We sat down opposite Bee Rock and for the first time Grayson told me of that last scene with her
He spoke without bitterness and he told me what she said word for word without a breath of blame for her
I do not believe that he judged her at all she did not know he always said she did not KNOW and then when I opened my lips Grayson reached silently for my wrist and I can feel again the warning crush of his fingers and I say nothing against her now
I asked Grayson what his answer was
I asked her he said solemnly if she had ever seen a purple rhododendron
I almost laughed picturing the scene the girl bewildered by his absurd question Grayson calm superbly courteous
It was a mental peculiarity of histhis irrelevancyand it was like him to end a matter of life and death in just that way
I told her I should send her one
I am waiting for them to come out he added and he lay back with his head against a stone and sighted the telescope on a dizzy point about which buzzards were circling
There is just one bush of rhododendron up there he went on
I saw it looking down from the Point last spring
I imagine it must blossom earlier than that across there on Bee Rock being always in the sun
No its not budding yet he added with his eye to the glass
You see that ledge just to the left
I dropped a big rock from the Point square on a rattler who was sunning himself there last spring
I can see a foothold all the way up the cliff
It can be done he concluded in a tone that made me turn sharply upon him
Do you really mean to climb up there
I asked harshly
If it blossoms first up thereIll get it where it blooms first
In a moment I was angry and half sick with suspicion for I knew his obstinacy and then began what I am half ashamed to tell
Every day thereafter Grayson took that glass with him and I went along to humor him
I watched Bee Rock and he that one bush at the throat of the peakneither of us talking over the matter again
It was uncanny that rivalrysun and wind in one spot sun and wind in anotherNature herself casting the fate of a halfcrazed fool with a flower
It was utterly absurd but I got nervous over itapprehensive dismal
A week later it rained for two days and the water was high
The next day the sun shone and that afternoon Grayson smiled looking through the glass and handed it to me
I knew what I should see
One purple cluster full blown was shaking in the wind
Grayson was leaning back in a dream when I let the glass down
A cool breath from the woods behind us brought the odor of roots and of black earth up in the leaves and sunlight somewhere a woodthrush was singing and I saw in Graysons face what I had not seen for a long time and that was peacethe peace of stubborn purpose
He did not come for me the next day nor the next but the next he did earlier than usual
I am going to get that rhododendron he said
I have been halfway upit can be reached
So had I been halfway up
With nerve and agility the flower could be got and both these Grayson had
If he had wanted to climb up there and drop he could have done it alone and he would have known that I should have found him
Grayson was testing himself again and angry with him for the absurdity of the thing and with myself for humoring it but still not sure of him I picked up my hat and went
I swore to myself silently that it was the last time I should pay any heed to his whims
I believed this would be the last
The affair with the girl was over
The flower sent I knew Grayson would never mention her name again
Nature was radiant that afternoon
The mountains had the leafy luxuriance of June and a rich sunlit haze drowsed on them between the shadows starting out over the valley and the clouds so white that the blue of the sky looked dark
Two eagles shot across the mouth of the Gap as we neared it and high beyond buzzards were sailing over Graysons rhododendron
I went up the ravine with him and I climbed up behind himGrayson going very deliberately and whistling softly
He called down to me when he reached the shelf that looked halfway
You mustnt come any farther than this he said
Get out on that rock and Ill drop them down to you
Then he jumped from the ledge and caught the body of a small tree close to the roots and my heart sank at such recklessness and all my fears rose again
I scrambled hastily to the ledge but I could get no farther
I might possibly make the jump he had madebut how should I ever get back
How would he
I called angrily after him now and he wouldnt answer me
I called him a fool a coward I stamped the ledge like a childbut Grayson kept on foot after hand with stealthy caution and the purple cluster nodding down at him made my head whirl
I had to lie down to keep from tumbling from the ledge and there on my side gripping a pine bush I lay looking up at him
He was close to the flowers now and just before he took the last upward step he turned and looked down that awful height with as calm a face as though he could have dropped and floated unhurt to the ravine beneath
Then with his left hand he caught the ledge to the left strained up and holding thus reached out with his right
The hand closed about the cluster and the twig was broken
Grayson gave a great shout then
He turned his head as though to drop them and that far away I heard the sibilant whir of rattles
I saw a snakes crest within a yard of his face and my God
I saw Grayson loose his left hand to guard it
The snake struck at his arm and Grayson reeled and caught back once at the ledge with his left hand
He caught once I say to do him full justice then without a word he droppedand I swear there was a smile on his face when he shot down past me into the trees
I found him down there in the ravine with nearly every bone in his body crushed
His left arm was under him and outstretched in his right hand was the shattered cluster with every blossom gone but one
One white half of his face was unmarked and on it was still the shadow of a smile
I think it meant more than that Grayson believed that he was near peace at last
It meant that Fate had done the deed for him and that he was glad
Whether he would have done it himself I do not know and that is why I say that though Grayson brought the flower downsmiling from peak to ravine I do not know that he was not after all a coward
That night I wrote to the woman in Kentucky
I told her that Grayson had fallen from a cliff while climbing for flowers and that he was dead
Along with these words I sent a purple rhododendron
