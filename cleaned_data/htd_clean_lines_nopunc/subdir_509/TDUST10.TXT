THE GRAIN OF DUST I INTO the offices of Lockyer Sanders Benchley Lockyer  Norman corporation lawyers there drifted on a December afternoon a girl in search of work at stenography and typewriting
The firm was about the most important and most famousradical orators often said infamousin New York
The girl seemed at a glance about as unimportant and obscure an atom as the city hid in its vast ferment
She was blondetawny hair fair skin blue eyes
Aside from this hardly conclusive mark of identity there was nothing positive nothing definite about her
She was neither tall nor short neither fat nor thin neither grave nor gay
She gave the impression of a young person of the feminine genderthat and nothing more
She was plainly dressed like thousands of other girls in darkish blue jacket and skirt and white shirt waist
Her boots and gloves were neat her hair simply and well arranged
Perhaps in these respectsin neatness and tasteshe did excel the average which is depressingly low
But in a city where more or less strikingly pretty women bent upon being seen are as plentiful as the blackberries of Kentuckys Julyin New York no one would have given her a second look this quiet young woman screened in an atmosphere of selfeffacement
She applied to the head clerk
It so happened that need for another typewriter had just arisen
She got a trial showed enough skill to warrant the modest wage of ten dollars a week she became part of the office force of twenty or twentyfive young men and women similarly employed
As her lack of skill was compensated by industry and regularity she would have a job so long as business did not slacken
When it did she would be among the first to be let go
She shrank into her obscure niche in the great firm came and went in mouse like fashion said little obtruded herself never was all but forgotten
Nothing could have been more commonplace more trivial than the whole incident
The name of the girl was HallowellMiss Hallowell
On the chief clerks pay roll appeared the additional information that her first name was Dorothea
The head office boy in one of his occasional spells of freshness addressed her as Miss Dottie
She looked at him with a puzzled expression it presently changed to a slight sweet smile and she went about her business
There was no rebuke in her manner she was far too selfeffacing for anything so positive as the mildest rebuke
But the head office boy blushed awkwardlywhy he did not know and could not discover though he often cogitated upon it
She remained Miss Hallowell
Opposites suggest each other
The dimmest personality in those offices was the girl whose name imaged to everyone little more than a pencil notebook and typewriting machine
The vividest personality was Frederick Norman
In the list of names upon the outer doors of the firms vast labyrinthine suite on the seventeenth floor of the Syndicate Building his name came lastand in the newest lettering suggesting recentness of partnership
In age he was the youngest of the partners
Lockyer was archaic Sanders an antique Benchley actually only about fiftyfive had the air of one born in the grandfather class
Lockyer the son dyed his hair and affected jauntiness but was in fact not many years younger than Benchley and had the stiffening jerky legs of one paying for a lively youth
Norman was thirtysevenat the age the Greeks extolled as divine because it means all the best of youth combined with all the best of manhood
Some people thought Norman younger almost boyish
Those knew him uptown only where he hid the man of affairs beneath the man of the worldthatamusesitself
Some people thought he looked and was older than the age with which the biographical notices credited him
They knew him down town onlywhere he dominated by sheer force of intellect and will
As has been said the firm ranked among the greatest in New York
It was a trusted counselor in large affairscommercial financial politicalin all parts of America in all parts of the globe for many of its clients were international traffickers
Yet this young man this youngest and most recent of the partners had within the month forced a reorganization of the firmor rather of its profitson a basis that gave him no less than one half of the whole
His demand threw his four associates into paroxysms of rage and fearthe fear serving as a wholesome antidote to the rage
It certainly was infuriating that a youth admitted to partnership barely three years ago should thus maltreat his associates
Ingrate was precisely the epithet for him
At least so they honestly thought after the quaint human fashion for because they had given him the partnership they looked on themselves as his benefactors and neglected as unimportant detail the sole and entirely selfish reason for their graciousness
But enraged though these worthy gentlemen were and eagerly though they longed to treat the conceited and grasping upstart as he richly deserved they accepted his ultimatum
Even the venerable and veneerated Lockyerthan whom a more convinced self deceiver on the subject of his own virtues never wore white whiskers black garments and the other badges of eminent respectabilityeven old Joseph Lockyer could not twist the acceptance into another manifestation of the benevolence of himself and his associates
They had to stare the grimacing truth straight in the face they were yielding because they dared not refuse
To refuse would mean the departure of Norman with the firms most profitable business
It costs heavily to live in New York the families of successful men are extravagant so conduct unbecoming a gentleman may not there be resented if to resent is to cut down ones income
The time was as the dignified and nicely honorable Sanders observed when these and many similar low standards did not prevail in the legal profession
But such is the frailty of human natureor so savage the pressure of the need of the material necessities of civilized life let a profession become profitable or develop possibilities of profiteven the profession of statesman even that of lawyeror doctoror priest or wifeand straightway it begins to tumble down toward the brawl and stew of the market place
In a last effort to rouse the gentleman in Norman or to shame him into pretense of gentlemanliness Lockyer expostulated with him like a prophet priest in full panoply of saintly virtue
And Lockyer was passing good at that exalted gesture
He was a Websterian figure with the venality of the great Daniel in all its pompous dignity modernizedand correspondingly expanded
He abounded in those idealist sonorosities that are the stockintrade of all solemn oldfashioned frauds
The young man listened with his wonted attentive courtesy until the dolorous appeal disguised as fatherly counsel came to an end
Then in his bluegray eyes appeared the gleam that revealed the tenacity and the penetration of his mind
He said Mr Lockyer you have been absent six years except an occasional two or three weeksabsent as American Ambassador to France
You have done nothing for the firm in that time
Yet you have not scorned to take profits you did not earn
Why should I scorn to take profits I do earn
Mr Lockyer shook his picturesque head in sad remonstrance at this vulgar coarse but latterly frequent retort of insurgent democracy upon indignant aristocracy
But he answered nothing
Also proceeded the graceless youth in the clear and concise way that won the instant attention of juries and Judges also our profession is no longer a profession but a business
His humorous eyes twinkled merrily
It divides into two partsteaching capitalists how to loot without being caught and teaching them how to get off if by chance they have been caught
There are other branches of the profession but theyre not lucrative so we do not practice them
Do I make myself clear
Mr Lockyer again shook his head and sighed
I am not an Utopian continued young Norman
Law and custom permitnot to say sanctifyour sort of business
SoI do my best
But I shall not conceal from you that its distasteful to me
I wish to get out of it
I shall get out as soon as Ive made enough capital to assure me the income I have and need
Naturally I wish to gather in the necessary amount as speedily as possible
Fred my boy I regret that you take such low views of our noble profession
Yesas a profession it is noble
But not as a practice
MY regret is that it invites and compels such low views
You will look at these things moremore mellowly when you are older
I doubt if Ill ever rise very high in the art of selfdeception replied Norman
If Id had any bent that way Id not have got so far so quickly
It was a boastful remarkof a kind he and other similar young men have the habit of making
But from him it did not sound boastfulsimply a frank and timely expression of an indisputable truth which indeed it was
Once more Mr Lockyer sighed
I see you are incorrigible said he
I have not acted without reflection said Norman
And Lockyer knew that to persist was simply to endanger his dignity
I am getting old said he
Indeed I am old
I have gotten into the habit of leaning on you my boy
I cant consent to your going hard though you make it for us to keep you
I shall try to persuade our colleagues to accept your terms
Norman showed neither appreciation nor triumph
He merely bowed slightly
And so the matter was settled
Instead of moving into the suite of offices in the Mills Building on which he had taken an option young Norman remained where he had been toiling for twelve years
After this specimen of Normans quality no one will be surprised to learn that in figure he was one of those solidly built men of medium height who look as if they were made to sustain and to deliver shocks to bear up easily under heavy burdens or that his head thickly covered with fairish hair was hatchetshaped with the helve or face suggesting that while it could and would cleave any obstacle it would wear a merry if somewhat sardonic smile the while
No one had ever seen Norman angry though a few persevering offenders against what he regarded as his rights had felt the results of swift and powerful action of the same sort that is usually accompaniedand weakenedby outward show of anger
Invariably goodhumored he was soon seen to be more dangerous than the men of flaring temper
In most instances good humor of thus unbreakable species issues from weakness from a desire to conciliateusually with a view to plucking the more easily
Normans good humor arose from a sense of absolute security which in turn was the product of confidence in himself and amiable disdain for his fellow men
The masses he held in derision for permitting the classes to rule and rob and spit upon them
The classes he scorned for caring to occupy themselves with so cheap and sordid a game as the ruling robbing and spitting aforesaid
Coming down to the specific he despised men as individuals because he had always found in each and everyone of them a weakness that made it easy for him to use them as he pleased
Not an altogether pleasant character this
But not so unpleasant as it may seem to those unable impartially to analyze human character even their own especially their own
And let anyone who is disposed to condemn Norman first look within himselfin some less hypocritical and selfdeceiving moment if he have such momentsand let him note what are the qualities he relies upon and uses in his own struggle to save himself from being submerged and sunk
Further there were in Norman many agreeable qualities important but less fundamental therefore less deep hiddentherefore generally regarded as the real man and as the cause of his success in which they in fact had almost no part
He was for example of striking physical appearance was attractively dressed and mannered was prodigally generous
Neither as lawyer nor as man did he practice justice
But while as lawyer he practiced injustice as man he practiced mercy
Whenever a weakling appealed to him for protection he gave itat times with splendid recklessness as to the cost to himself in antagonisms and enmities
Indeed so great were the generosities of his character that had he not been arrogant disdainful selfconfident reso lutely and singleheartedly ambitious he must inevitably have ruined himselfif he had ever been able to rise high enough to be worthy the dignity of catastrophe
Successful men are usually trying persons to know well
Lambs asses and chickens do not associate happily with lions wolves and hawksnor do birds and beasts of prey get on well with one another
Norman was regarded as difficult by his friendsby those of them who happened to get into the path of his ambition in front of instead of behind him and by those who fell into the not unnatural error of misunderstanding his good nature and presuming upon it
His clients regarded him as insolent
The big businesses seeking the rich spoils of commerce frequent highly perilous waters
They need skillful pilots
Usually these lawyerpilots know their place and put on no airs upon the quarterdeck while they are temporarily in command
Not so Norman
He took the full rank authority and emolumentsof commander
And as his power fame and income were swiftly growing it is fair to assume that he knew what he was about
He was admiredextravagantly admiredby young men with not too broad a vein of envy
He was no woman hateranything but that
Indeed those who wished him ill had from time to time hoped to see him tumble down through miscalculation in some of his audacities with women
Nohe did not hate women
But there were several women who hated himor tried to and if wounded vanity and baffled machination be admitted as just causes for hatred they had cause
He likedbut he did not wholly trust
When he went to sleep it was not where Delilah could wield the shears
A most irritating prudenceirritating to friends and intimates of all degrees and kinds in a race of beings with a mania for being trusted implicitly but with no balancing mania for deserving trust of the implicit variety
And he ate hugelyand whatever he pleased
He could drink beyond belief all sorts of things with no apparent ill effect upon either body or brain
He had all the appetites developed abnormally and abnormal capacity for gratifying them
Where there was one man who envied him his eminence there were a dozen who envied him his physical capacities
We cannot live and act without doing mischief as well as that which most of us would rather do provided that in the doing we are not ourselves undone
Probably in no direction did Norman do so much mischief as in unconsciously leading men of his sets down town and up to imitate his colossal dissipationswhich were not dissipation for him who was abnormal
Withal he was a monster for work
There is not much truth in mens unending talk of how hard they work or are worked
The ravages from their indulgences in smoking drinking gallantry eating too much and too fast and too often have to be explained away creditably to themselves and to othersnotably to the wives or mothers who nurse them and suffer from their diminishing incomes
Hence the wailing about work
But once in a while a real worker appearsa man with enormous ingenuity at devising difficult tasks for himself and with enormous persistence in doing them
Frederick Norman was one of these bluemoon prodigies
Obviously such a man could not but be observed and talked about
Endless stories some of them more or less true most of them apocryphal were told of him stories of his shrewd unexpected moves in big cases of his witty retorts of his generosities of his peculiarities of dress of eating and drinking stories of his adventures with women
Whatever he did however trivial took color and charm from his personality so easy yet so difficult so simple yet so complex so baffling
Was he wholly selfish
Was he a friend to almost anybody or to nobody
Did he ever love
No one knew not even himself for life interested him too intensely and too incessantly to leave him time for selfanalysis
One thing he was certain of he hated nobody envied nobody
He was too successful for that
He did as he pleased
And on the whole he pleased to do far less inconsiderately than his desires his abilities and his opportunities tempted
Have not men been acclaimed good for less
In the offices where he was canvased daily by part ners clerks everyone down to the cleaners whose labors he so often delayed opinion varied from day to day
They worshiped him they hated him
They loved him they feared him
They regarded him as more than human as less than human but never as just human though always as endowed with fine human virtues and even finer human weaknesses
Miss Tillotson next to the head clerk in rank and payand a pretty and pushing young persondreamed of getting acquainted with himreally well acquainted
It was a vain dream
For him between up town and down town a great gulf was fixed
Also he had no interest in or ammunition for sparrows
It was in December that Miss HallowellMiss Dorothea Hallowellgot her temporary place at ten dollars a weekthat obscure event somewhat like a field mouse taking quarters in a horizonbounded grain field
It was not until midFebruary that she the palest of personalities came into direct contact with Norman about the most refulgent
This is how it happened
Late in that February afternoon an hour or more after the last of the office force should have left Norman threw open the door of his private office and glanced round at the rows on rows of desks
The lights in the big room were on apparently only because he was still within
With an exclamation of disappointment he turned to reenter his office
He heard the click of type writer keys
Again he looked round but could see no one
Isnt there some one here
he cried
Dont I hear a typewriter
The noise stopped
There was a slight rustling from a far corner beyond his view and presently he saw advancing a slim and shrinking slip of a girl with a face that impressed him only as small and insignificant
In a quiet little voice she said Yes sir
Do you wish anything
Why what are you doing here
he asked
I dont think Ive ever seen you before
Yes
I took dictation from you several times replied she
He was instantly afraid he might have hurt her feelings and he who in the days when he was far far less than now had often suffered from that commonplace form of brutality was most careful not to commit it
I never know whats going on round me when Im thinking explained he though he was saying to himself that the next time he would probably again be unable to remember one with nothing distinctive to fix identity
You areMiss
Miss Hallowell
How do you happen to be here
Ive given particular instructions that no one is ever to be detained after hours
A little color appeared in the pale small faceand now he saw that she had a singularly fair and smooth skin singularly beautifuland he wondered why he had not noticed it before
Being a close observer he had long ago noted and learned to appreciate the wonders of that most amazing of tissues the human skin and he had come to be a connoisseur
Im staying of my own accord said she
They ought not to give you so much work said he
Ill speak about it
Into the small face came the look of the frightened childa fascinating look
And suddenly he saw that she had lovely eyes clear expressive innocent
Please dont she pleaded in the gentle quiet voice
It isnt overwork
I did a brief so badly that I was ashamed to hand it in
Im doing it again
He laughed and a fine frank laugh he had when he was in the mood
At once a smile lighted up her face danced in her eyes hovered bewitchingly about her lipsand he wondered why he had not at first glance noted how sweet and charmingly fresh her mouth was
Why shes beautiful he said to himself the manly mans inevitable interest in feminine charm wide awake
Really beautiful
If she had a figureand were tall As he thought thus he glanced at her figure
A figure
Tall
She certainly was tallno she wasntyes she was
No not tall from head to foot but with the most captivating long lineslong throat long bust long arms long in body and in legs long and slenderyet somehow not tall
Heall this took but an instantreturned his glance to her face
He was startled
The beauty had fled leaving not a trace behind
Before him wavered once more a small insignificance
Even her skin now seemed commonplace
She was saying Did you wish me to do something
Yesa letter
Come in he said abruptly
Once more the business in hand took possession of his mind
He became unconscious of her presence
He dictated slowly carefully choosing his words for perhaps a quarter of an hour
Then he stopped and paced up and down revolving a new idea a new phase of the business that had flashed upon him
When he had his thoughts once more in form he turned toward the girl the mere machine
He gazed at her in amazement
When he had last looked he had seen an uninteresting nonentity
But that was not this person seated before him in the same garments and with the same general blondness
That person had been a girl
This time the transformation was not into the sweet innocence of lovely childhood but into something incredibly different
He was gazing now at a woman a beautiful world weary woman one who had known the joys and then the sorrows of life and love
Heavy were the lids of the large eyes gazing mournfully into infinitygazing upon the graves of a life the long long vista of buried joys
Never had he seen anything so sad or so lovely as her mouth
The soft smooth skin was not merely pale its pallor was that of wakeful nights of weeping until there were no more tears to drain away
Miss Hallowell he began
She startled and like the flight of an interrupted dream the woman he had been seeing vanished
There sat the commonplace young person he had first seen
He said to himself I must be a little off my base tonight and went on with the dictation
When he finished she withdrew to transcribe the letter on the typewriter
He seated himself at his desk and plunged into the masses of documents
He lost the sense of his surroundings until she stood beside him holding the typewritten pages
He did not glance up but seized the sheets to read and sign
You may go said he
I am very much obliged to you
And he contrived as always to put a suggestion of genuineness into the customary phrase
Im afraid its not good work said she
Ill wait to see if I am to do any of it over
No thank you said he
And he looked up to find himself gazing at still another person wholly different from any he had seen before
The others had all been womenwomanly women full of the weakness the delicateness rather that distinguishes the feminine
This woman he was looking at now had a look of strength
He had thought her frail
He was seeing a strong womana splendidly healthy body with sinews of steel most gracefully covered by that fair smooth skin of hers
And her features toowhy this girl was a person of character of will
He glanced through the pages
All rightthank you he said hastily
Please dont stay any longer
Leave the other thing till tomorrow
Noit has to be done tonight
But I insist upon your going
She hesitated said quietly Very well and turned to go
And you mustnt do it at home either
She made no reply but waited respectfully until it was evident he wished to say no more then went out
He bundled together his papers sealed and stamped and addressed his letter put on his overcoat and hat and crossed the outer office on his way to the door
It was empty she was gone
He descended in the elevator to the street remembered that he had not locked one of his private cases returned
As he opened the outer door he heard the sound of typewriter keys
In the corner the obscure sheltered corner sat the girl bent with childlike gravity over her typewriter
It was an amusing and a touching sightshe looked so young and so solemnly in earnest
Didnt I tell you to go home
he called out with mock sternness
Up she sprang her hand upon her heart
And once more she was beautiful but once more it was in a way startlingly unbelievably different from any expression he had seen before
Now really
Miss He had forgotten her name
You must not stay on here
We arent such slave drivers as all that
Go home please
Ill take the responsibility
She had recovered her equanimity
In her quiet gentle voicebut it no longer sounded weak or insignificant she said You are very kind Mr Norman
But I must finish my work
Havent I said Id take the blame
But you cant replied she
I work badly
I seem to learn slowly
If I fall behind I shall lose my placesooner or later
It was that way with the last place I had
If you interfered youd only injure me
Ive had experience
AndI must not lose my place
One of the scrub women thrust her mussy head and ragged shapeless body in at the door
With a start Norman awoke to the absurdity of his situationand to the fact that he was placing the girl in a compromising position
He shrugged his shoulders went in and locked the cabinet departed
What a queer little insignificance she is
thought he and dismissed her from mind
II MANY and fantastic are the illusions the human animal in its ignorance and its optimism devises to change life from a pleasant journey along a plain road into a fumbling and stumbling and struggling about in a fog
Of these hallucinations the most grotesque is that the weak can come together can pass a law to curb the strong can set one of their number to enforce it may then disperse with no occasion further to trouble about the strong
Every line of every page of history tells how the strongthe nimblewitted the farsighted the ambitioushave worked their will upon their feebler and less purposeful fellow men regardless of any and all precautions to the contrary
Conditions have improved only because the number of the strong has increased
With so many lions at war with each other not a few rabbits contrive to avoid perishing in the nest
Normans genius lay in ability to take away from an adversary the legal weapons implicitly relied upon and to arm his client with them
No man understood better than he the abysmal distinction between law and justice no man knew better than he how to compel or to assistcourts to apply the law so just in the general to promoting injustice in the particular
And whenever he permitted conscience a voice in his internal debatesit was not oftenhe heard from it its usual servile approbation How can the reign of justice be more speedily brought about than by making the reign of lawlawyer lawintolerable
About a fortnight after the trifling incident related in the previous chapter Norman had to devise a secret agreement among several of the most eminent of his clients
They wished to band together to do a thing expressly forbidden by the law they wished to conspire to lower wages and raise prices in several railway systems under their control
But none would trust the others so there must be something in writing laid away in a secret safety deposit box along with sundry bundles of securities put up as forfeit all in the custody of Norman
When he had worked out in his mind and in fragmentary notes the details of their agreement he was ready for some one to do the clerical work
The some one must be absolutely trustworthy as the plain language of the agreement would make clear to the dullest mind dazzling opportunities for profitnot only in stock jobbing but also in blackmail
He rang for Tetlow the head clerk
Tetlowsmooth and sly and smug lacking only courageous initiative to make him a great lawyer but lacking that lacking allTetlow entered and closed the door behind him
Norman leaned back in his desk chair and laced his fingers behind his head
One of your typewriters is a slight blonde girlsits in the corner to the far left if shes still here
Miss Hallowell said Tetlow
We are letting her go at the end of this week
Shes nice and ladylike and willingin fact most anxious to please
But the works too difficult for her
Shes ratherratherwell not exactly stupid but slow
Um said Norman reflectively
Theres Miss Bostwickperhaps shell do
Miss Bostwick got married last week
Norman smiled
He remembered the girl because she was the oldest and homeliest in the office
Theres somebody for everybodyeh Tetlow
He was a lighthouse keeper said Tetlow
Theres a story that he advertised for a wife
But that may be a joke
Why not that MissMiss Halloway
mused Norman
Miss Hallowell corrected Tetlow
Hallowellyes
Is sheVERY incompetent
Not exactly that
But business is slackening and shes been only temporaryand Norman cut him off with Send her in
You dont wish her dismissed
I havent told her yet
Oh Im not interfering in your department
Do as you like



Noin this caselet her stay on for the present
I can use her said Tetlow
And she gets only ten a week
Norman frowned
He did not like to HEAR that an establishment in which he had control paid less than decent living wageseven if the market price did excuseyes compel it
Send her in he repeated
Then as Tetlow was about to leave She is trustworthy
All our force is
I see to that Mr
Norman
Has she a young mansteady company I think they call it
She has no friends at all
Shes extremely shy at least reserved
Lives with her father an old crank of an analytical chemist over in Jersey City
She hasnt even a lady friend
Well send her in
A moment later Norman looking up from his work saw the dim slim nonentity before him
Again he leaned back and as he talked with her studied her face to make sure that his first judgment was correct
Do you stay late every night
asked he smilingly
She colored a little but enough to bring out the exquisite fineness of her white skin
Oh I dont mind said she and there was no embarrassment in her manner
Ive got to learnand doing things over helps
Nothing equal to it declared Norman
Youve been to school
Only six weeks confessed she
I couldnt afford to stay longer
I mean the other sort of schoolnot the typewriting
Oh
Yes said she
And once more he saw that extraordinary transformation
She became all in an instant delicately deliciously lovely with the moving in a way pathetic loveliness of sweet children and sweet flowers
Her look was mystery but not a mystery of guile
She evidently did not wish to have her past brought to view but it was equally apparent that behind it lay hid nothing shameful only the sad perhaps the painful
Of all the periods of life youth is the best fitted to bear deep sorrows for then the spirit has its full measure of elasticity
Yet a shadow upon youth is always more moving than the shadows of maturer yearsthose shadows that do not lie upon the surface but are heavy and corroding stains
When Norman saw this shadow upon her youth so immaturelooking so helplesslooking he felt the first impulse of genuine interest in her
Perhaps had that shadow happened to fall when he was seeing her as the commonplace and colorless little struggler for bread and seeming doomed speedily to be worsted in the struggleperhaps he would have felt no interest but only the brief qualm of pity that we dare not encourage in ourselves on a journey so beset with hopeless pitiful things as is the journey through life
But he had no impulse to question her
And with some surprise he noted that his reason for refraining was not the usual reasonunwillingness uselessly to add to ones own burdens by inviting the mournful confidences of another
No he checked himself because in the manner of this frail and mouselike creature dim though she once more was there appeared a dignity a reserve that made intrusion curiously impossible
With an apologetic note in his voicea kind and friendly voicehe said Please have your typewriter brought in here
I want you to do some work for mework that isnt to be spoken ofnot even to Mr
Tetlow
He looked at her with grave penetrating eyes
You will not speak of it
No replied she and nothing more
But she accompanied the simple negative with a clear and honest sincerity of the eyes that set his mind completely at rest
He felt that this girl had never in her life told a real lie
One of the office boys installed the typewriter and presently Norman and the quiet nebulous girl at whom no one would trouble to look a second time were seated opposite each other with the broad table desk between he leaning far back in his desk chair fingers interlocked behind his proud stronglooking head she holding sharpened pencil suspended over the stenographic note book
Long before she seated herself he had forgotten her except as machine
There followed a troubled hour as he dictated ordered erasure redictated ordered re readings skipped back and forth in the effort to frame the secret agreement in the fewest and simplest and least startlingly unlawful words
At last he leaned forward with the shine of triumph in his eyes
Read straight through he commanded
She read interrupted occasionally by a sharp order from him to correct some mistake in her notes
Again he commanded when she translated the last of her notes
This time she was not interrupted once
When she ended he exclaimed Good
I dont see how you did it so well
Nor do I said she
You say you are only a beginner
I couldnt have done it so well for anyone else said she
You aredifferent
The remark was worded most flatteringly but it did not sound so
He saw that she did not herself understand what she meant by different
HE understood for he knew the difference between the confused and confusing ordinary minds and such an intelligence as his ownsimple luminous enlightening all minds however dark so long as they were in the lightflooded region around it
Have I made the meaning clear
he asked
He hoped she would reply that he had not though this would have indicated a partial defeat in the object he hadto put the complex thing so plainly that no one could fail to understand
But she answered Yes
He congratulated himself that his overestimate of her ignorance of affairs had not lured him into giving her the names of the parties at interest to transcribe
But did she really understand
To test her he said What do you think of it
That its wicked replied she without hesitation and in her small quiet voice
He laughed
In a way this girl sitting there this inconsequential and negligible atomtypefied the masses of mankind against whom that secret agreement was directed
They the feeble and powerless ones with their necks ever bent under the yoke of the mighty and their feet ever stumbling into the traps of the crafty they too would utter an impotent Wicked
if they knew
His voice had the note of gentle raillery in it as he said Nonot wicked
Just business
She was looking down at her book her face expressionless
A few moments before he would have said it was an empty face
Now it seemed to him sphynxlike
Just business he repeated
It is going to take money from those who dont know how to keep or to spend it and give it to those who do know how
The money will go for building up civilization instead of for beer and for bargaintrough finery to make working mens wives and daughters look cheap and nasty
She was silent
Now do you understand
I understand what you said
She looked at him as she spoke
He wondered how he could have fancied those lackluster eyes beautiful or capable of expression
You dont believe it
he asked
No said she
And suddenly in those eyes gazing now into space there came the unutterably melancholy lookheavylidded from heartache wearywise from long long and bitter experiences
Yet she still looked younggirlishly youngbut it was the youthful look the classic Greek sculptors tried to give their young goddessesthe youth without beginning or end younger than a babys older than the oldest of the sons of men
He mocked himself for the fancies this queer creature inspired in him but she none the less made him uneasy
You dont believe it
he repeated
No she answered again
My father has taught mesome things
He drummed impatiently on the table
He resented her impertinencefor like all men of clear and positive 
mind he regarded contradiction as in one 
pudent in another aspect evidence of the fol
contradictor
Then he gave a short laughthe 
ing laugh of the clever man who has tried to believe his own sophistries and has failed
Wellneither do I believe it said he
Now to get the thing typewritten
She seated herself at the machine and set to work
As his mind was full of the agreement he could not concentrate on anything else
From time to time he glanced at her
Then he gave up trying to work and sat furtively observing her
What a quaint little mystery it was
There was in itthat is in her not the least charm for him
But in all his experience with women he could recall no woman with a comparable development of this curious quality of multiple personalities showing and vanishing in swift succession
There had been a time when woman had interested him as a puzzle to be worked out a maze to be explored a temple to be penetrateduntil one reached the place where the priests manipulated the machinery for the wonders and miracles to fool the devotees into awe
Some men never get to this stage never realize that their own passions working upon the universal human love of the mysterious are wholly responsible for the cult of woman the sphynx and the sibyl
But Norman beloved of women had been let by them into their ultimate secretthe simple humanness of woman the 
ry of the oracles miracles and wonders
He 
red that her divine intuitions were mere 
guesses where they had any meaning at all that her eloquent silences were screens for ignorance or boredomand so on through the list of legends that prop the feminist cult
But this girlthis Miss Hallowellhere was a tangible mysterya mystery of physics of chemistry
He sat watching herwatching the changes as she bent to her work or relaxed or puzzled over the meaning of one of her own hesitating stenographic hieroglyphics watched her as the waning light of the afternoon varied its intensity upon her skin
Why her very hair partook of this magical quality and altered its tint its degree of vitality even in harmony with the other changes



What was the explanation
By means of what rare mechanism did her nerve force ebb and flow from moment to moment bringing about these fascinating surface changes in her body
Could anything even any skin be better made than that superb skin of hers that master work of delicacy and strength of smoothness and color
How had it been possible for him to fail to notice it when he was always looking for signs of a good skin down townand up town tooin these days of the ravages of pastry and candy



What long graceful fingers she hadyet what small hands
Certainly here was a peculiarity that persisted
No absurd though it seemed no
One way he looked at those hands they were broad and strong another way narrow and gracefully weak
He said to himself The man who gets that girl will have Solomons wives rolled into one
A harem at the price of a wifeor a He left the thought unfinished
It seemed an insult to this helpless little creature the more rather than the less cowardly for being unspoken for no doubt her ideas of propriety were firmly conventional
About done
he asked impatiently
She glanced up
In a moment
Im sorry to be so slow
Youre not he assured her truthfully
Its my impatience
Let me see the pages youve finished
With them he was able to concentrate his mind
When she laid the last page beside his arm he was absorbed did not look at her did not think of her
Take the machine away said he abruptly
He was leaving for the day when he remembered her again
He sent for her
I forgot to thank you
It was good work
You will do well
All you need is practiceand confidence
Especially confidence
He looked at her
She seemed frailtouchingly frail
You are not strong
She smiled and in an instant the frailty seemed to have been mere delicacy of buildthe delicacy that goes with the strength of steel wires or rather of the spiders weaving thread which sustains weights and shocks out of all proportion to its appearance
Ive never been ill in my life said she
Not a day
Again because she was standing before him in full view he noted the peculiar construction of her frame the beautiful lines of length so dextrously combined that her figure as a whole was not tall
He said A working womanor manneeds health above all
Thank you again
And he nodded a somewhat curt dismissal
When she glided away and he was alone behind the closed door he reflected for a moment upon the extraordinary amount of thinkingand the extraordinary kind of thinkinginto which this poor little typewriter girl had beguiled him
He soon found the explanation for this vagary into a realm so foreign to a man of his high tastes and ambitions
Its because Im so in love with Josephine he decided
Ive fallen into the sentimental state of all lovers
The whole sex becomes novel and interesting and worth while
As he left the office unusually late he saw her still at workno doubt doing over again some bungled piece of copying
She had her normal and natural look and airthe atomic little typewriter unattractive and uninteresting
With another smile for his romantic imaginings he forgot her
But when he reached the street he remembered her again
The threatened blizzard had changed into a heavy rain
The swift and sudden currents of air that have made of New York a cave of the winds since the coming of the skyscrapers were darting round corners turning umbrellas inside out tossing womens skirts about their heads reducing all who were abroad to the same level of drenched and sullen wretched ness
Normans limousine was waiting at the curb
He pausing in the doorway glanced up and down the street had an impulse to return and take the girl home
Then he smiled satirically at himself
Her lot condemned her to be out in all weathers
It would not be a kindness but an exhibition of smug vanity to shelter her this one night also there was the question of her reputationand the possibility of turning her head perhaps just enough to cause her ruin
He sprang across the windswept rainswept sidewalk and into the limousine whose door was being held open by an obsequious attendant
Home he said and the door slammed
Usually these journeys between office and home or club in the evening gave Norman a chance for ten or fifteen minutes of sleep
He had discovered that this brief dropping of the thread of consciousness gave him a wonderful fresh grip upon the day enabled him to work or play until late into the night without fatigue
But that evening his mind was wide awake
Nor could he fix it upon business
It would interest itself only in the hurrying throngs of foot passengers and the ideas they suggested Here am Iso ran his thoughtshere am I tucked away comfortably while all those poor creatures have to plod along in the storm
I could afford to be sick
They cant
And what have I done to deserve this good fortune
Nothing
Worse than nothing
If I had made my career along the lines of what is honest and right and beneficial to my fellow men Id probably be plugging home under an umbrella and to a pretty poor excuse for a home
But I was too wise to do that
Ive spent this day as I spend all my days in helping the powerful rich to add to their wealth and power to add to the burdens those poor devils out there in the rain must bear
And Im rewarded with a limousine and all the rest of it
These thoughts neither came from nor produced a mood of penitence or of regret even
Norman was simply indulging in his favorite pastimefollowing without prejudice the leading of a chain of pure logic
He despised selfdeceivers
He always kept himself free from prejudice and all its wiles
He took life as he found it but he did not excuse it and himself with the familiar hypocrisies that make the comfortable classes preen themselves on being the guardians and saviours of the ignorant incapable masses
When old Lockyer said one day that this was the function of the upper classes Norman retorted Perhaps
But if so how do they perform it
Like the brutal oldfashioned farm family that takes care of its insane member by keeping him chained in filth in the cellar
And once at the Federal Club By the way Norman had joined it had compelled it to receive him just to show his associates how a strong man could break even such a firmly established tradition as that no one who amounted to anything could be elected to a fashionable club in New York
Once at the Federal Club old Galloway quoted with approval some essayists remark that every clever human being was looking after and holding above the waves at least fifteen of his weaker fellows
Norman smiled satirically round at the complacently nodding circle of gray heads and white heads
My observation has been said he that every clever chap is shrewd enough to compel at least fifteen of his fellows to wait on him to take care of himdo his choresand his dirty work
The nodding stopped
Scowls appeared except on the face of old Galloway
He grinned
He was one of the few examples of a very rich man with a sense of humor
Norman always thought it was this slight incident that led to his getting the extremely profitableand shadyGalloway business
No Normans mood as he watched the miserable crowds afoot and reflected upon them was neither remorseful nor triumphant
He simply noted an interesting facta commonplace factof the methods of that sardonic practical joker Life
Because the scheme of things was unjust and stupid because others most others were uncomfortable or worsewhy should he make himself uncomfortable
It would be an absurdity to get out of his limousine and trudge along in the wet and the wind
It would be equally absurd to sit in his limousine and be unhappy about the misery of the world
I didnt create it and I cant recreate it
And if Im helping to make it worse Im also hastening the time when itll be better
The Great Ass must have brains and spirit kicked and cudgeled into it
At his house in Madison Avenue just at the crest of Murray Hill there was an awning from front door to curb and a carpet beneath it
He passed dry and comfortable up the steps
A footman in quiet rich livery was waiting to receive him
From rising until bedtime up town and down town wherever he went and whatever he was about every possible menial detail of his life was done for him
He had nothing to do but think about his own work and keep himself in health
Rarely did he have even to open or to close a door
He used a pen only in signing his name or marking a passage in a law book for some secretary to make a typewritten copy
Upon most human beings this sort of luxury carried beyond the ordinary and familiar uses of menial service has a speedily enervating effect
Thinking being the most onerous of all they have it done also
They sink into silliness and moral and mental sloth
They pass the time at foolish purposeless games indoors and out or they wander aimlessly about the earth chattering with similar mental decrepits much like monkeys adrift in the boughs of a tropical forest
But Norman had the tenacity and strength to concentrate upon achievement all the powers emancipated by the use of menials wherever menials could be used
He employed to advantage the time saved in putting in shirt buttons and lacing shoes and carrying books to and from shelves
In this lay one of the important secrets of his success
Never do for yourself what you can get some one else to do for you as well
Save yourself for the things only YOU can do
In his household there were three persons and sixteen servants to wait upon them
His sistershe and her husband Clayton Fitzhugh were the other two personshis sister was always complaining that there were not enough servants and Frederick the most indulgent of brothers was always letting her add to the number
It seemed to him that the more help there was the less smoothly the household ran
But that did not concern him his mind was saved for more important matters
There was no reason why it should concern him could he not compel the dollars to flood in faster than she could bail them out
This brother and sister had come to New York fifteen years before when he was twentytwo and she nineteen
They were from Albany where their family had possessed some wealth and much social position for many generations
There was the usual queer streak in the Norman familyan intermittent but fixed habit of some one of them making a low marriage
One view of this aberration might have been that there was in the Norman blood a tenacious instinct of sturdy and selfrespecting independence that caused a Norman occasionally to do as he pleased instead of as he conven tionally ought
Each time the thing occurred there was a mighty and horrified hubbub throughout the connection
But in the broad as the custom is the Normans were complacent about the queer streak
They thought it kept the family from rotting out and running to seed
Nothing like an occasional infusion of common blood Aunt Ursula Van Bruyten born Norman used to say
For her Normans sister was named
Normans father had developed the queer streak
Their mother was the daughter of a small farmer and when she met their father was chambermaid in a Troy hotel Troy then being a largish village
As soon as she found herself married and in a position with whose duties she was unfamiliar she set about fitting herself for them with the same diligence and thoroughness which she had shown in learning chamber work in a village hotel
She educated herself selected not without shrewdness and carefully put on an assortment of genteel airs finally contrived to make a most creditable appearancewas more aristocratic in tastes and in talk than the high mightiest of her relatives by marriage
But her son Fred was a Pinkey in character
In boyhood he was noted for his rough and low associates
His bosom friends were the son of a Jewish junk dealer the son of a colored wash woman and the son of an Irish day laborer
Also the commonness persisted as he grew up
Instead of seeking aristocratic ease he aspired to a career
He had choice of several rich and wellborn girls but he developed a strong distaste for marriage of any sort and especially for a rich marriage
A fortune he was resolved to have but it should be one that belonged to him
When he was about ready to enter a law office his father and mother died leaving less than ten thousand dollars in all for his sister and himself
His sister hesitated half inclined to marry a stupid second cousin who had thirty thousand a year
Dont do it Ursula Fred advised
If you must sell out sell for something worth while
He laughed in his frank ironical way
Fact is weve both made up our minds to sell
Lets go to the best market New York
If you dont like it you can come back and marry that fatwit any time you please
Ursula inspected herself in the glass saw a face and form exceeding fair to look upon she decided to take her brothers advice
At twenty she threw over a multi millionaire and married Clayton Fitzhugh for love Clayton with only seventeen thousand a year
Of course from the standpoint of fashionable ambition seventeen thousand a year in New York is but one remove from tenement house poverty
As Clayton had no more ability at making money than had Ursula herself there was nothing to do but live with Norman and take care of him
But for this selfsacrifice of sisterly affection Norman would have been rich at thirty seven
As he had to make her rich as well as himself progress toward luxurious independence was slower and there was the house costing nearly fifty thousand a year to keep up
There had been a time in Normans careera brief and very early timewhen with the maternal peasant blood hot in his veins he had entertained the quixotic idea of going into politics on the poor or peoples side and fighting for glory only
The pressure of expensive living had soon driven this notion clean off
Norman had almost forgotten that he ever had it was no longer aware how strong it had been in the last year at law school
Young men of high intelligence and ardent temperament always pass through this period
With somea fewits glory lingers long after the fire has flickered out before the cool steady breath of worldliness
All this time Norman has been dressing for dinner
He now leaves the third floor and descends toward the library as it still lacks twenty minutes of the dinner hour
As he walked along the hall of the second floor a womans voice called to him That you Fred
He turned in at his sisters sitting room
She was standing at a table smoking a cigarette
Her tall slim figure looked even taller and slimmer in the tightfitting black satin evening dress
Her features faintly suggested her relationship to Norman
She was a handsome woman with a voluptuous discontented mouth
What are you worried about sis
inquired he
How did you know I was worried
returned she
You always are
Oh
But youre unusually worried tonight
How did you know that
You never smoke just before dinner unless your nerves are ragged



What is it
Money
Of course
No one in New York worries about anything else
But THIS is serious protested she
Ive been thinkingabout your marriageand whatll become of Clayton and me
She halted red with embarrassment
Norman lit a cigarette himself
I ought to have explained said he
But I assumed youd understand
Fred you know Clayton cant make anything
And when you marrywhywhat WILL become of us
Ive been taking care of Claytons moneyand of yours
Ill continue to do it
I think youll find youre not so badly of
You see my position enables me to compel a lot of the financiers to let me in on the ground floorand to warn me in good time before the house falls
Youll not miss me Ursula
She showed her gratitude in her eyes in a slight quiver of the lips in an unsteadiness of tone as she said Youre the real thing Freddie
You can go right on as you are now
Only He was looking at her with meaning directness
She moved uneasily refused to meet his gaze
Well
she said with a suggestion of defiance
Its all very natural to get tired of Clayton said her brother
I knew you would when you married him
But Sis I mind my own business
Still Why make a fool of yourself
You dont understand she exclaimed passionately
And the light in her eyes the color in her cheeks restored to her for the moment the beauty of her youth that was almost gone
Understand what
inquired he in a tone of gentle mockery
Love
You are all ambitionall self control
You can be affectionateGod knows you have been to me Fred
But love you know nothing aboutnothing
His was the smile a man gives when in earnest and wishing to be thought jestingor when in jest and wishing to be thought in earnest
You mean Josephine
Oh yes I suppose you do care for her in a wayin a nice conventional way
She is a fine handsome piecejust the sort to fill the position of wife to a man like you
Shes sweet and charming she appreciates she flatters you
Im sure she loves you as much as a GIRL knows how to love
But its all so conventional so proper
Your positionher money
You two are of the regulation type even in that youre suited to each other in height and figure
Everybodyll say What a fine coupleso well matched
 Maybe YOU dont understand said Norman
If Josephine were poor and lowbornwerent one of usand all thatwould you have her
Im sure I dont know was his prompt and amused answer
I can only say that I know what I want she being what she is
Ursula shook her head
I have only to see you and her together to know that you at least dont understand love
It might be well if YOU didnt said Norman dryly
You might be less unhappyand Clayton less uneasy
Ah but I cant help myself
Dont you see it in me Fred
Im not a fool
Yet see what a fool I act
Spoiled childthats all
No selfcontrol
You despise everyone who isnt as strong as you
She looked at him intently
I wonder if you ARE as selfcontrolled as you imagine
Sometimes I wish youd get a lesson
Then youd be more sympathetic
But it isnt likely you willnot through a woman
Oh theyre such pitifully easy game for a man like you
But then men are the same way with youquite as easy
You get anything you want



Youre really going to stick to Josephine
He nodded
Its time for me to settle down
YesI think it is she went on thoughtfully
I can hardly believe youre to marry
Of course shes the grand prize
StillI never imagined youd come in and surrender
I guess you DO care for her
Why else should I marry
argued he
Shes got nothing I needexcept herself Ursula
What IS it you see in her
What you seewhat everyone sees replied Fred with quiet convincing enthusiasm
What no one could help seeing
As you say shes the grand prize
Yes she is sweet and handsomeand intelligent very superior without making others feel that theyre outclassed
Stilltheres something lackingnot in her perhaps but in you
You have it for hershes crazy about you
But she hasnt it for you
What
I cant tell you
It isnt a thing that can be put into words
Then it doesnt exist
Oh yes it does cried Ursula
If the engagement were to be brokenor if anything were to happen to herwhy youd get over itwould go on as if nothing had happened
If she didnt fit in with your plans and ambitions shed be sacrificed so quick shed not know what had taken off her head
But if you felt what I meanthen youd give up everythingdo the wildest craziest things
What nonsense
scoffed Norman
I can im agine myself making a fool of myself about a woman as easily as about anything else
But I cant imagine myself playing the fool for anything whatsoever
There was mysterious fire in Ursulas absent eyes
You remember me as a girlhow mercenary I was how near I came to marrying Cousin Jake
I saved you from that
Yesand for what
I fell in love
And out again
I was deceived in Claytondeceived myself naturally
How is a woman to know without experience
Oh Im not criticising said the brother
Besides a love marriage that fails is different from a mercenary marriage that fails
Veryvery agreed he
Just the difference between an honorable and a dishonorable bankruptcy
Anyhowits bankruptmy marriage
But Ive learned what love isthat there is such a thingand that its valuable
Yes Fred Ive got the taste for that winethe habit of it
Could I go back to water or milk
Spoiled babythats the whole story
If you had a nursery full of childrenor did the heavy house workyoud never think of these foolish moonshiny things
Yet you say you love
Clayton is as good as any youre likely to run acrossis better than SOME Ive seen about
How can YOU say
cried she
Its for me to judge
If you would only JUDGE
Ursula sighed
Its useless to talk to you
Lets go down
Norman following her from the room stopped her in the doorway to give her a brotherly hug and kiss
You wont make an outandout idiot of yourself will you Ursula
he said in his winning manner
The expression of her eyes as she looked at him showed how strong was his influence over her
You know Ill come to you for advice before I do anything final said she
Oh I dont know what I want
I only know what I dont want
I wish I were well balancedas you are Fred
III THE brother and sister dined alone
Clayton was finding his club a more comfortable place than his home in those days of his wifes disillusionment and hesitation about the future
Many weak creatures are curiously armed for the unequal conflict of existence some with fleetness of foot some with a polecat weapon of malignance some with porcupine quills some with a possumlike instinct for playing dead
Of these last was Fitzhugh
He knew when to be silent when to keep out of the way when to sit tight and wait
His wife had discovered that he was a foolthat he perhaps owed more to his tailor than to any other single factor for the success of his splendid pose of the thorough gentleman
Yet she did not realize what an utter fool he was so clever had he been in the use of the art of discreet silence
Norman suspected him but could not believe a human being capable of such fathomless vacuity as he found whenever he tried to explore his brotherinlaws brain
After dinner Norman took Ursula to the opera to join the Seldins and after the first act went to Josephine who had come with only a deaf old aunt
Josephine loved music and to hear an opera from a box one must be alone
Norman entered as the lights went up
It always gave him a feeling of dilation this spectacle of material splendorthe women whose part it is throughout civilization today to wear for public admiration and envy the evidences of the prowess of the males to whom they belong
A truer version of Dr Holmess aphorism would be that it takes several generations in oil to make a deepdyed snobwholly to destroy a mans or a womans point of view sense of the kinship of all flesh and to make him or her over into the genuine believer in caste and worshiper of it
For all his keenness of mind of humor Norman had the fastdyed snobbishness of his family and friends
He knew that caste was silly that such displays as this vulgar flaunting of jewels and costly dresses were in atrocious bad taste
But it is one thing to know another thing to feel and his feeling was delight in the spectacle pride in his own high rank in the aristocracy
His eyes rested with radiant pleasure on the girl he was to marry
And she was indeed a person to appeal to the passion of pride
Simply and most expensively dressed in pearl satin with only a little jewelry she sat in the front of her parterre box a queen by right of her fathers wealth her familys position her own beauty
She was a large womantall a big frame but not ungainly
She had brilliant dark eyes a small proud head set upon shoulders that were slenderly young now and even when they should became matronly would still be beautiful
She had good teeth an exquisite smile the gentle good humor of those who comfortable themselves would not have the slightest objection to all others being equally so
Because she laughed appreciatively and repeated amusingly she had great reputation for wit
Because she industriously picked up from men a plausible smatter of small talk about politics religion art and the like she was renowned as clever verging on profound
And she believed herself both witty and wiseas do thousands male and female with far less excuse
She had selected Norman for the same reason that he had selected her each recognized the other as the grand prize
Pity is not nearly so close kin to love as is the feeling that the other person satisfies to the uttermost all ones pet vanities
It would have been next door to impossible for two people so well matched not to find themselves drawn to each other and filled with sympathy and the sense of comradeship so far as there can be comradeship where two are driving luxuriously along the way of life with not a serious cause for worry
People without half the general fitness of these two for each other have gone through to the end regarding themselves and regarded as the most devoted of lovers
Indeed they were lovers
Only one of those savage tests to which in all probability they would never be exposed would or could reveal just how much or how little that vague variable word lovers meant when applied to them
As their eyes met into each pair leaped the fine exalted light of pride in possession
This wonderful woman is mine
his eyes said
And her eyes answered And youyou most wonderful of menyou are mine
It always gave each of them a thrill like intoxication to meet after a days separation
All the joy of their dazzling good fortune burst upon them afresh
Ill venture you havent thought of me the whole day said she as he dropped to the chair behind her
It was a remark she often madeto give him the opportunity to say Ive thought of little else Im sorry to sayI who have a career to look after
He made the usual answer and they smiled happily at each other
And you
he said
Oh I
What else has a woman to think about
Her statement was as true as his was false
He was indeed all she had to think aboutall worth wasting the effort of thought upon
But hethough he did not realize ithad thought of her only in the incidental way in which an ambitionpossessed man must force himself to think of a woman
The best of his mind was commandeered to his career
An amiable but shakily founded theory that it was our career enabled him to say without sense of lying that his chief thought had been she
How those men down town would poke fun at you said she if they knew you had me with you all the time right beside you
This amused him
Still I suspect there are lots of men whod be exposed in the same way if there were a general and complete showdown
Sometimes I wish I really were with youworking with youhelping you
You have girlsa girlto be your secretaryor whatever you call itdont you
You should have seen the one I had today
But theres always something pathetic about every girl who has to make her own living
Pathetic
protested Miss Burroughs
Not at all
I think its fine
You wouldnt say that if you had tried it
Indeed I should she declared with spirit
You men are entirely too soft about women
You dont realize how strong they are
And of course women dont resist the temptation to use their sex when they see how easy it is to fool men that way
The sad thing about it is that the woman who gets along by using her sex and by appealing to the softheartedness of men never learns to rely on herself
Shes likely to come to grief sooner or later
Theres truth in all that said Norman
Enough to make it dangerously unjust
Theres so much lying done about getting on that its no wonder those whove never tried to do for themselves get a wholly false notion of the situation
It is hardbitterly hardfor a man to get on
Most men dont
Most men
All but a mere handful
And if those who do get on were to tell the truththe WHOLE truthabout how they succeeded well itd not make a pleasant story
But YOUVE got on retorted the girl
So I have
And how
Norman smiled with humorous cynicism
Ill never tellnot allonly the parts that sound well
And those parts are the least important
However lets not talk about that
What I set out to say was that while its hard for a man to make a decent livingunless he has luckand harder stillmuch harderfor him to rise to independence It wasnt so dreadfully hard for YOU interrupted Josephine looking at him with proud admiration
But then you had a wonderful brain
That wasnt what did it replied he
And in spite of all my advantagesfriendships education enough money to tide me over the beginningsin spite of all that I had a frightful time
Not the work
Of course I had to work but I like that
No it was the the maneuvering lets call itthe hardening process
You
she exclaimed
Everyone who succeedsin active life
You dont understand the system dear
Its a cutthroat game
It isnt at all what the successful hypocrites describe in their talks to young men
He laughed
If I had followed the guides to success Id not be here
Oh yes Ive made terrible sacrifices but his look at her made her thrill with exaltationit was worth doing



I understand and sympathize with those who scorn to succeed
But Im glad I happened not to be born with their temperament at least not with enough of it to keep me down
Youre too hard on yourself too generous to the failures
Oh I dont mean the men who were too lazy to do the work or too cowardly to dare thethe unpleasant things
And Im not hard with myselfonly frank
But we were talking of the women
Poor things what chance have they got
You scorn them for using their sex
Wait till youre drowning dear before you criticise another for what he does to save himself when hes sinking for the last time
I used everything I had in making my fight
If I could have got on better or quicker by the aid of my sex Id have used that
Dont say those things Fred cried Josephine smiling but half in earnest
Why not
Arent you glad Im here
She gave him a long look of passionate love and lowered her eyes
At whatever cost
Yes she said in a low voice
But Im SURE you exaggerate
Ive done nothing YOU wouldnt approve ofor find excuses for
But thats because youIall of us in this classand in most other classeshave been trained to false ideasno to perverted ideasto a system of morality thats twisted to suit the demands of practical life
On Sundays we go to a magnificent church to hear an expensive preacher and choir go in expensive dress and in carriages and we never laugh at ourselves
Yet we are going in the name of One who was born in a stable and who said that we must give everything to the poor and so on
But I dont see what we could do about it she said hesitatingly
We couldnt do anything
Onlydont you see my pointthe difference between theory and practice
Personally Ive no objectionno strong objectionto the practice
All I object to is the lying and faking about it to make it seem to fit the theory
But we were talking of womenwomen who work
Ive no doubt youre right admitted she
I suppose they arent to blame for using their sex
I ought to be ashamed of myself to sneer at them
As a matter of fact their sex does few of them any good
The reverse
You see an attractive woman one whos attractive AS a womancan skirmish round and find some one to support her
But most of the working womenthose who keep on at itdont find the man
Theyre not attractive not even at the start
After theyve been at it a few years and lose the little bloom they ever hadwhy theyve got to take their chances at the game precisely like a man
Only theyre handicapped by always hoping that theyll be able to quit and become married women
Id like to see how men would behave if they could find or could imagine any alternative to root hog or die
 Whats the matter with you this evening Fred
I never saw you in such a bitter mood
We never happened to get on this subject before
Oh yes we have
And you always have scoffed at the men who fail
And I still scoff at themmost of them
A lot of lazy cowards
Or else so bent on selfindulgence petty selfindulgencethat they refuse to make the small sacrifice today for the sake of the large advantage day after tomorrow
Or else so stuffed with vanity that they never see their own mistakes
However why blame them
They were born that way and cant change
A man who has the equipment of success and succeeds has no more right to sneer at one less lucky than you would have to laugh at a poor girl because she wasnt dressed as well as you
What a mood
SOMETHING must have happened
Perhaps said he reflectively
Possibly that girl set me off
What girl
The one I told you about
The unfortunate little creature who was typewriting for me this afternoon
Not so very little either
A curious figure she had
She was tall yet she wasnt
She seemed thin and when you looked again you saw that she was really only slender and beautifully shaped throughout
Miss Burroughs laughed
She must have been attractive
Not in the least
Absolutely without charmand so homelyno not homelycommonplace
No thats not right either
She had a startling way of fading and blazing out
One moment she seemed a blankpale lifeless colorless a nobody
The next minute she becameamazingly different
Not the same thing every time but different things
Frederick Norman was too experienced a dealer with women deliberately to make the mistakerather to commit the breach of tact and courtesyinvolved in praising one woman to another
But in this case it never occurred to him that he was talking to a woman of a woman
Josephine Burroughs was a lady the other was a piece of office machineryand a very trivial piece at that
But he saw and instantly understood the look in her eyesthe strained effort to keep the telltale upper lip from giving its prompt and irrepressible signal of inward agitation
Im very much interested said she
Yes she was a curiosity said he carelessly
Has she been therelong
inquired Josephine with a feigned indifference that did not deceive him
Several months I believe
I never noticed her until a few days ago
And until today I had forgotten her
Shes one of the kind its difficult to remember
He fell to glancing round the house pretending to be unconscious of the furtive suspicion with which she was observing him
She said Shes your secretary now
Merely a general office typewriter
The curtain went up for the second act
Josephine fixed her attention on the stageapparently undivided attention
But Norman felt rather than saw that she was still worrying about the curiosity
He marveled at this outcropping of jealousy
It seemed ridiculous it WAS ridiculous
He laughed to himself
If she could see the girlthe obscure uninteresting cause of her agitationhow she would mock at herself
Then too there was the absurdity of thinking him capable of such a stoop
A woman of their own classor a woman of its corresponding class on the other side of the line yes
No doubt she had heard things that made her uneasy or at least ready to be uneasy
But this poorly dressed obscurity with not a charm that could attract even a man of her own lowly class It was such a good joke that he would have teased Josephine about it but for his knowledge of the worlda knowledge in whose primer it was taught that teasing is both bad taste and bad judgment
Also it was beneath his dig nity it was offense to his vanity to couple his name with the name of one so beneath him that even the matter of sex did not make the coupling less intolerable
When the curtain fell several people came into the box and he went to make a few calls round the parterre
He returned after the second act
They were again alonethe deaf old aunt did not count
At once Josephine began upon the same subject
With studied indifferencehow amusing for a woman of her inexperience to try to fool a man of his experienceshe said Tell me some more about that typewriter girl
Women who work always interest me
She wouldnt said Norman
The subject had been driven clean out of his mind and he didnt wish to return to it
Some day they will venture to make judicious long cuts in Wagners operas and then theyll be interesting
It always amuses me this reverence of little people for the great onesas if a great man were always great
Nohe IS always great
But often its in a dull way
And the dull parts ought to be skipped
I dont like the opera this evening said she
What you said a while ago has set me to thinking
Is that girl a lady
She works laughed he
But she might have been a lady
Im sure I dont know
Dont you know ANYTHING about her
Except that shes trustworthyand insignificant and not too good at her business
I shouldnt think you could afford to keep incompetent people said the girl shrewdly
Perhaps they wont keep her parried Norman gracefully
The head clerk looks after those things
He probably likes her
No said Norman too indifferent to be cautious
She has no gentlemen friends
 How do you know that
said the girl and she could not keep a certain sharpness out of her voice
Tetlow the head clerk told me
I asked him a few questions about her
I had some confidential work to do and didnt want to trust her without being sure
He saw that she was now prey to her jealous suspicion
He was uncertain whether to be amused or irritated
She had to pause long and with visible effort collect herself before venturing Oh she does confidential work for you
I thought you said she was incompetent
He the expert crossexaminer had to admire her skill at that high science and art
I felt sorry for her he said
She seemed such a forlorn little creature
She laughed with a constrained attempt at raillery
I never should have suspected you of such weakness
To give confidential things to a forlorn little incompetent out of pity
He was irritated distinctly
The whole thing was preposterous
It reminded him of feats of his own before a jury
By clever questioning Josephine had made about as trifling an incident as could be imagined take on really quite imposing proportions
There was annoyance in his smile as he said Shall I send her up to see you
You might find it amusing and maybe you could do something for her
Josephine debated
Yes she finally said
I wish you would send her with a little sarcasm if you can spare her for an hour or so
Dont make it longer than that laughed he
Everything will stop while shes gone
It pleased him in a way this discovery that Josephine had such a common commonplace weakness as jealousy
But it also took away something from his high esteem for heran esteem born of the lovers idealizings for while he was not of the kind of men who are on their knees before women he did have a deep respect for Josephine incarnation of all the material things that dazzled hima respect with something of the reverential in it and something of awemore than he would have admitted to himself
Today as of old the image makers are as sincere worshipers as visit the shrines
In our prostrations and genuflections in the temple we do not discriminate against the idols we ourselves have manufactured on the contrary them we worship with peculiar gusto
Norman knew his gods were frauds that their divine qualities were of the earth earthy
But he served them and what most appealed to him in Josephine was that she incorporated about all their divine qualities
He and his sister went home together
Her first remark in the auto was What were you and Josie quarreling about
Quarreling
inquired he in honest surprise
I looked at her through my glasses and saw that the was all upsetand you too
This is too ridiculous cried he
She lookedjealous
Nonsense
What an imagination you have
I saw what I saw Ursula maintained
Well I suppose she has heard somethingsomething recent
I thought you had sworn off Fred
But I might have known
Norman was angry
He wondered at his own exasperation out of all proportion to any apparent provoking cause
And it was most unusual for him to feel temper all but unprecedented for him to show it no matter how strong the temptation
Its a good idea to make her jealous pursued his sister
Nothing like jealousy to stimulate interest
Josephine is not that sort of woman
You know better
All women are that sort
All men too
Of course some men and women grow angry and go away when they get jealous while others stick closer
So one has to be judicious
Josephine and I understand each other far too well for such pettiness
Try her
No you neednt
You have
Didnt I tell you Then what was she questioning you about
Just to show you how wrong you were Ill tell you
She was asking me about a poor little girl down at the officeone she wants to help
Ursula laughed
To help out of your office I guess
I thought youd lived long enough Fred to learn that no woman trusts ANY man about ANY woman
Who is this poor little girl
I dont even know her name
One of the typewriters
What made Josephine jealous of her
Havent I told you Josephine was not But I saw
Who is this girlpretty
Norman pretended to stifle a yawn
Josephine bored me half to death talking about her
Now its you
I never heard so much about so little
Is there something up between you and the girl
teased Ursula
Now thats an outrage
cried Norman
Shes got nothing but her reputation poor child
Do leave her that
Is she very young
How should I know
Youth is a charm in itself
What sort of rot is this
exclaimed he
Do you think Id drop down to anything of that kindin ANY circumstances
A little working girland in my own office
Why do you heat so Fred
teased the sister
Really I dont wonder Josephine was torn up
An auto almost ran into themone of those innumerable hairbreadth escapes that make the streets of New York as exciting as a battleand as dangerous
For a few minutes Ursulas mind was deflected
But a fatality seemed to pursue the subject of the pale obscurity whose very name he was uncertain whether he remembered aright
Said Ursula as they entered the house A girl working in the office with a man has a magnificent chance at him
Its lucky for the men that women dont know their business but are amateurs and too stuck on themselves to set and bait their traps properly
Is that girl trying to get round you
What possesses everybody tonight
cried Norman
I tell you the girl s as uninteresting a specimen as you could find
Then why are YOU so interested in her
teased the sister
Norman shrugged his shoulders laughed with his normal easy good humor and went to his own floor
On top of the pile of letters beside his plate next morning lay a note from Josephine Dont forget your promise about that girl dear
Ive an hour before lunch and could see her then
I was out of humor last night
Im very penitent this morning
Please forgive me
Maybe I can do something for her
JOSEPHINE
Norman read with amused eyes
Well
soliloquized he Im not likely to forget that poor little creature again
What a fuss about nothing
IV MANY men possibly a majority have sufficient equipment for at least a fair measure of success
Yet all but a few are downright failures passing their lives in helpless dependence glad to sell themselves for a small part of the value they create
For this there are two main reasons
The first is as Norman said that only a few men have the selfrestraint to resist the temptings of a small pleasure today in order to gain a larger tomorrow or next day
The second is that few men possess the power of continuous concentration
Most of us cannot concentrate at all any slight distraction suffices to disrupt and destroy the whole train of thought
A good many can concentrate for a few hours for a week or so for two or three months
But there comes a small achievement and it satisfies or a small discouragement and it disheartens
Only to the rare few is given the power to concentrate steadily year in and year out through good and evil event or report
As Norman stepped into his auto to go to the office he had ridden a horse in the park before breakfast until its hide was streaked with latherthe instant he entered his auto he discharged his mind of everything but the business before him down townor rather business filled his mind so completely that everything else poured out and away
A really fine minda perfect or approximately perfect instrument to the purposes of its possessoris a marvelous spectacle of order
It is like a vast public library constantly used by large numbers
There are alcoves rows on rows shelves on shelves with the exactest system everywhere prevailing with the attendants moving about in listbottomed shoes fulfilling without the least hesitation or mistake the multitude of directions from the central desk
It is like an admirably drilled army where there is the nice balance of freedom and discipline that gives mobility without confusion the divisions down to files and even units can be disposed along the line of battle wherever needed or can be marshaled in reserve for use at the proper moment
Such a mind may be used for good purpose or bador for mixed purposes after the usual fashion in human action
But whatever the service to which it is put it acts with equal energy and precision
Characterthat is a thing apart
The character determines the morality of action but only the intellect determines the skill of action
In the offices of that great law firm one of the keenest pleasures of the more intelligent of the staff was watching the workings of Frederick Normans mind its ease of movement its quickness and accuracy its obedience to the code of mental habits he had fixed for himself
In large part all this was born with the man but it had been brought to a state of perfection by the most painful labor by the severest discipline by years of practice of the sacrifice of small temptations temptations to waste time and strength on the little pleasant things which result in such heavy billsbills that bankrupt a man in middle life and send him in old age into the deserts of poverty and contempt
Such an unique and trivial request as that of Josephine Burroughs being wholly out of his mental habit for down town he forgot it along with everything else having to do with uptown onlyalong with Josephine herself to tell a truth which may pique the woman reader and may be wholly misunderstood by the sentimentalists
By merest accident he was reminded
As the door of his private office opened to admit an important client he happened to glance up
And between the edge of the door frame and his clients automobilefattened and carefully dressed body he caught a glimpse of the poor little forlornness who chanced to be crossing the outer office
A glint of sunlight on her hair changed it from lifelessness to golden vital vividness the same chance sunbeam touched her pale skin with a soft yellow radiationand her profile was delicately fine and regular
Thus Norman who ob served everything saw a head of finely wrought gold a startling cameo against the dead white of office wall
It was only with the second thought that he recognized her
The episode of the night before came back and Josephines penitent yet persistent note
He glanced at the clock
Said the client in the amusing tone of one who would like to take offense if he only dared Ill not detain you long Mr Norman
And really the matter is extremely important
There are not many lawyers even of the first rank with whom their big clients reverse the attitude of servant and master
Norman might well have been flattered
In that restrained tone from one used to servility and fond of it and easily miffed by lack of it was the whole story of Normans long battle and splendid victory
But he was not in the mood to be flattered he was thinking of other things
And it presently annoyed him that his usually docile mind refused to obey his wills order to concentrate on the client and the business said business being one of those huge schemes through which a big monster of a corporation is constructed by lawyers out of materials supplied by great capitalists and controllers of capital is set to eating in enormous meals the substance of the people at some obscure point in all the principal veins small but leechlike parasite corporations are attached industriously to suck away the surplus blood so that the owners of the beast may say It is eating almost nothing
See how lean it is poor thing
Why the bones fairly poke through its meager hide
An interesting and highly complicated enterprise is such a construction
It was of the kind in which Normans mind especially delighted Hercules is himself only in presence of an herculean labor
But on that day he could not concentrate and because of a trifle
He felt like a giant disabled by a grain of dust in the eye yes a mere grain of dust
I must love Josephine even more than I realize to be fretted by such a paltry thing thought he
And after patiently enduring the client for half an hour without being able to grasp the outlines of the project he rose abruptly and said I must get into my mind the points youve given me before we can go further
So Ill not waste your time
This sounded very like Clear outyouve bored me to my limit of endurance
But the motions of a mind such as he knew Norman had were beyond and high above the clients mere cunning at dollartrapping
He felt that it was the part of wisdomalso soothing to vanityto assume that Norman meant only what his words conveyed
When Norman was alone he rang for an office boy and said Please ask Miss Halliday to come here
The boy hesitated
Miss Hallowell
he suggested
HallowellthanksHallowell said Norman
And it somehow pleased him that he had not remembered her name
How significant it was of her insignificance that so accurate a memory as his should make the slip
When she impassive colorless nebulous stood before him the feeling of pleasure was queerly enough mingled with a sense of humiliation
What absurd vagaries his imagination had indulged in
For it must have been sheer hallucination his seeing those wonders in her
How he would be laughed at if those pictures he had made of her could be seen by any other eyes
They must be right when they say a man in love is touched in the head
Only why the devil should I have happened to get these crazy notions about a person Ive no interest in
However the main point and most satisfactorywas that Josephine would be at a glance convincedconvictedmade ashamed of her absurd attack
A mere grain of dust
Just a moment please he said to Miss Hallowell
I want to give you a note of introduction
He wrote the note to Josephine Burroughs Here she is
Ive told her you wish to talk with her about doing some work for you
When he finished he looked up
She was standing at the window gazing out upon the tremendous panorama of skyscrapers that makes New York the most astounding of the cities of men
He was about to speak
The words fell back unuttered
For once more the hallucinationor whatever it was laid hold of him
That figure by the windowthat beautiful girl with the great dreamy eyes and the soft and languorous nuances of golden haze over her hair over the skin of perfectly rounded cheek and perfectly moulded chin curving with ideal grace into the whitest and firmest of throats Am I mad
or do I really see what I see
he muttered
He turned away to clear his eyes for a second view for an attempt to settle it whether he saw or imagined
When he looked again she was observing himand once more she was the obscure the cipherlike Miss Hallowell tendollaraweek typewriter and not worth it
Evidently she noted his confusion and was vaguely alarmed by it
He recovered himself as best he could and debated whether it was wise to send her to Josephine
Surely those transformations were not altogether his own hallucinations and Josephine might see might humiliate him by suspecting more strongly 


Ridiculous
He held out the letter
The lady to whom this is addressed wishes to see you
Will you go there right away please
It may be that youll get the chance to make some extra money
Youve no objection I suppose
She took the letter hesitatingly
You will find her agreeable I think continued he
At any rate the trip can do no harm
She hesitated a moment longer as if weighing what he had said
No it will do no harm she finally said
Then with a delightful color and a quick transformation into a vision of young shyness Thank you Mr Norman
Thank you so much
Not at allnot in the least he stammered the impulse strong to take the note back and ask her to return to her desk
When the door closed behind her he rose and paced about the room uneasily
He was filled with disquiet with hazy apprehension
His nerves were unsteady as if he were going through an exhausting strain
He sat and tried to force himself to work
Impossible
What sort of damn fool attack is this
he exclaimed pacing about again
He searched his mind in vain for any cause adequate to explain his unprecedented state
If I did not know that I was wellabsolutely wellId think I was about to have an illnesssomething in the brain
He appealed to that friend in any trying hour his sense of humor
He laughed at himself but his nerves refused to return to the normal
He rushed from his private office on various pretexts each time lingered in the general room talking aimlessly with Tetlowand watching the door
When she at last appeared he guiltily withdrew feeling that everyone was observing his perturbation and was wondering at it and jesting about it
And what the devil am I excited about
he demanded of himself
What indeed
He seated himself rang the bell
If Miss Hallowell has got back he said to the office boy please ask her to come in
I think shes gone out to lunch said the boy
I know she came in a while ago
She passed along as you was talking to Mr
Tetlow
Norman felt himself flushing
Any time will do he said bending over the papers spread out before him the papers in the case of the General Traction Company resisting the payment of its taxes
A noisome odor seemed to be rising from the typewritten sheets
He made a wry face and flung the papers aside with a gesture of disgust
They never do anything honest he said to himself
From the stockjobbing owners down to the nickelfilching conductors they stealsteal steal
And then he wondered at laughed at his heat
What did it matter
An ant pilfering from another ant and a sparrow stealing the crumb found by another sparrowa man robbing another man all part of the universal scheme
Only a narrowminded ignoramus would get himself wrought up over it a philosopher would laughand take what he needed or happened to fancy
The door opened
Miss Hallowell entered a small and demure hat upon her masses of thick fair hair arranged by anything but unskillful fingers
You wished to see me
came in the quiet little voice sweet and frank and shy
He roused himself from pretended abstraction
Ohits you
he said pleasantly
They said you were out
I was going to lunch
But if youve anything for me to do Ill be glad to stay
Nono
I simply wished to say that if Miss Burroughs wished to make an arrangement with you wed help you about carrying out your part of it
She was paleso pale that it brought out strongly the smooth deadwhite purity of her skin
Her small features wore an expression of pride of haughtiness even
And in the eyes that regarded him steadily there shone a cold lightthe light of a proud and lonely soul that repels intrusion even as the Polar fastnesses push back without effort assault upon their solitudes
We made no arrangement said she
You are not more than eighteen are you
inquired he abruptly
The irrelevant question startled her
She looked as if she thought she had not heard aright
I am twenty she said
You have a mostmost unusual way of shifting to various ages and personalities explained he with some embarrassment
She simply looked at him and waited
His embarrassment increased
It was a novel sensation to him this feeling ill at ease with a woman he who was at ease with everyone and put others at their ease or not as he pleased
Im sorry you and Miss Burroughs didnt arrange something
I suppose she found the hours difficult
She made me an offer replied the girl
I refused it
But as I told you we can let you offanything within reason
Thank you but I do not care to do that kind of work
No doubt any kind of work for wages classes one as a servant
But those people up therethey make one FEEL itfeel menial
Not Miss Burroughs I assure you
A satirical smile hovered round the girls lips
Her face was altogether lovely now and no lily ever rose more gracefully from its stem than did her small head from her slender form
She meant to be kind but she was insulting
Those people up there dont understand
Theyre vain and narrow
Oh I dont blame them
Only I dont care to be brought into contact with them
He looked at her in wonder
She talked of Josephine as if she were Josephines superior and her expression and accent were such that they contrived to convey an impression that she had the right to do it
He grew suddenly angry at her at himself for listening to her
I am sorry he said stiffly and took up a pen to indicate that he wished her to go
He rather expected that she would be alarmed
But if she was she wholly concealed it
She smiled slightly and moved toward the door
Looking after her he relented
She seemed so youngwas so youngand was evidently poor
He said Its all right to be proud Miss Hallowell
But there is such a thing as supersensitiveness
You are earning your living
If youll pardon me for thrusting advice upon you I think youve made a mistake
Im sure Miss Burroughs meant well
If you had been less sensitive youd soon have realized it
She patronized me replied the girl not angrily but with amusement
It was all I could do not to laugh in her face
The idea of a woman who probably couldnt make five dollars a week fancying she was the superior of any girl who makes her own living no matter how poor a living it is
Norman laughed
It had often appealed to his own sense of humor the delusion that the tower one happened to be standing upon was part of ones own stature
But he said Youre a very foolish young person
Youll not get far in the world if you keep to that road
It winds through Poverty Swamps to the Poor House
Oh no replied she
One can always die
Again he laughed
But why die
Why not be sensible and live
I dont know replied she
She was looking away dreamily and her eyes were wonderful to see
There are many things I feel and doand I dont at all understand why
But An expression of startling resolu tion flashed across her face
But I do them just the same
A brief silence then as she again moved toward the door he said You have been working for some time
Four years
You support yourself
I work to help out fathers income
He makes almost enough but not quite
Almost enough
The phrase struck upon Normans fancy as both amusing and sad
Almost enough for what
For keeping body and soul together for keeping body barely decently clad
Yet she was content
He said You like to work
Not yet
But I think I shall when I learn this business
One feels secure when one has a trade
It doesnt impress me as an interesting life for a girl of your age he suggested
Oh Im not unhappy
And at home of evenings and Sundays Im happy
Doing what
Reading and talking with father anddoing the houseworkand all the rest of it
What a monotonous narrow little life
He wanted to pity her but somehow he could not
There was no suggestion in her manner that she was an object of pity
What did Miss Burroughs say to youif I may ask
Certainly
You sent me and Im much obliged to you
I realize it was an opportunityfor another sort of girl
I half tried to accept because I knew refusing was only myqueerness
She smiled charmingly
You are not offended because I couldnt make myself take it
Not in the least
And all at once he felt that it was true
This girl would have been out of place in service
What was the offer
Suddenly before him there appeared a clever willful child full of the childish passion for imitation and mockery
And she proceeded to take off the grand Miss Burroughsenough like Josephine to give the satire point and barb
He could see Josephine resolved to be affable and equal to make this doubtless bedazzled stray from the lower classes feel comfortable in those palatial surroundings
She imitated Josephines walk her way of looking her voice for the menialsgracious and condescending
The exhibition was clever free from malice redolent of humor
Norman laughed until the tears rolled down his cheeks
You ought to go on the stage said he
How JosephineMiss Burroughs would appreciate it
For shes got a keen sense of humor
Not for the real jokeslike herself replied Miss Hallowell
Youre prejudiced
No
I see her as she is
Probably everyone else those around hersee her money and her clothes and all that
But I sawjust her
He nodded thoughtfully
Then he looked penetratingly at her
How did you happen to learn to do that
he asked
To see people as they are
Father taught me
Her eyes lighted up her whole expression changed
She became beautiful with the beauty of an intense and adoring love
Father is a wonderful manone of the most wonderful that ever lived
He There was a knock at the door
She startled he looked confused
Both awakened to a sense of their forgotten surroundings of who and what they were
She went and Mr Sanders entered
But even in his confusion Norman marveled at the vanishing of the fascinating personality who had been captivating him into forgetting everything else at the reappearance of the blank the pale and insignificant personality attached to a typewriting machine at ten dollars a week
No not insignificant not blanknever again that for him
He saw now the full realityand also why he everyone was so misled
She made him think of the surface of the sea when the sky is gray and the air calm
It lies smooth and flat and expressionlessinert monotonous
But let sunbeam strike or breeze ever so faint start up and what a commotion of unending variety
He could never look at her again without being reminded of those infinite latent possibilities without wondering what new and perhaps more charming more surprising varieties of look and tone and manner could be evoked
And while Sanders was talkingprosing on and on about things Norman either already knew or did not wish to knowhe was thinking of her
If she happens to meet a man with enough discernment to fall in love with her he said to himself he certainly will never weary
What a pity that such a girl shouldnt have had a chance should be wasted on some unappreciative chucklehead of her class
What a pity she hasnt ambitionor the quality whatever it isthat makes those who have it get on whether they wish or no
During the rest of the day he revolved from time to time indistinct ideas of somehow giving this girl a chance
He wished Josephine would and could help or perhaps his sister Ursula
It was not a matter that could be settled or even taken up in haste
No man of his mentality and experience fails to learn how perilous it is in the least to interfere in the destiny of anyone
And his notion involved not slight interference with advice or suggestion or momentarily extended helping hand but radical change of the whole current of destiny
Also he appreciated how difficult it is for a man to do anything for a young womananything that would not harm more than it would help
Only one thing seemed clear to himthe clever child ought to have a chance
He went to see Josephine after dinner that night His own house while richly and showily furnished as became his means and station seemedand indeed was merely an example of simple oldfashioned solid comfort in comparison with the Burroughs palace
He had never liked but being a true New Yorker had greatly admired the splendor of that palace its costly art junk its rotten old tapestries its unlovely genuine antiques its room after room of tasteless magnificence suggesting a museum or rather the combination home and salesroom of an art dealer
This evening he found himself curious critical disposed to license a long suppressed sense of humor
While he was waiting for Josephine to come down to the small salon into which he had been shown her older sister drifted in on the way to a late dinner and ball
She eyed him admiringly from head to foot
Youve SUCH an air Fred said she
You should hear the butler on the subject of you
He says that of all the men who come to the house you are most the man of the world
He says he could tell it by the way you walk in and take off your hat and coat and throw them at him
Norman laughed and said I didnt know
I must stop that
Dont
cried Mrs Bellowes
Youll break his heart
He adores it
You know servants dearly love to be treated as servants
Anyone who thinks the world loves equality knows very little about human nature
Most people love to look up just as most women love to be ruled
No you must continue to be the master the man of the world Fred
She was busy with her gorgeous and trailing wraps and with her cigarette or she would have seen his confusion
He was recalling his scene with the typewriter girl
Not much of the man of the world then and there certainly
What a grotesque performance for a man of his position for a serious man of any kind
And how came he to permit such a person to mimic Josephine Burroughs a lady the woman to whom he was engaged
In these proud and pretentious surroundings he felt contemptibly guiltyand dazed wonder at his own inexplicable folly and weakness
Mrs Bellowes departed before Josephine came down
So there was no relief for his embarrassment
He saw that she too felt constrained
Instead of meeting him half way in embrace and kiss as she usually did she threw him a kiss and pretended to be busy lighting a cigarette and arranging the shades of the table lamp
Well I saw your poor little creature  she began
She was splendidly direct in all her dealings after the manner of people who have never had to make their own wayto cajole or conciliate or dread the consequences of frankness
I told you youd not find her interesting
Oh she was a nice little girl replied Josephine with elaborate graciousnessand Norman the take off fresh in his mind was acutely critical of her manner of her mannerisms
Of course she went on one does not expect much of people of that class
But I thought her unusually wellmanneredand quite clean
Tetlow makes em clean up said Norman a gleam of sarcasm in his careless glance and tone
And into his nostrils stole an odor of freshness and health and youth the pure sweet odor that is the base of all the natural perfumes
It startled him his vivid memory of a feature of her which he had not been until now aware that he had ever noted
I offered her some work continued Josephine but I guess you keep her too busy down there for her to do anything else
Probably said Norman
Why do you sit on the other side of the room
Oh I dont know laughed Josephine
I feel queer tonight
And it seems to me youre queer too
I
Perhaps rather tired dearthats all
Did you and Miss Hallowell work hard today
Oh bother Miss Hallowell
Lets talk about ourselves
And he drew her to the sofa at one end of the big fireplace
I wish we hadnt set the wedding so far off
And suddenly he found himself wondering whether that remark had been prompted by eagerness a lovers eagernessor by impatience to have the business over and settled
You dont act a bit natural tonight Fred
You touch me as if I were a stranger
I like that
mocked he
A stranger hold your hand like thisandkiss youlike this
She drew away suddenly laid her hands on his shoulders kissed him upon the lips passionately then looked into his eyes
DO you love me FredREALLY
Why so earnest
Youve had a great deal of experience
More or less
Have you ever loved any woman as you love me
Ive never loved any woman but you
I never before wanted to marry a woman
But you may be doing it becausewell you might be tired and want to settle down
Do you believe that
No I dont
But I want to hear you say it isnt so
Wellit isnt so
Are you satisfied
Im frightfully jealous of you Fred
What a waste of time
Ive got something to confesssomething Im ashamed of
Dont confess cried he laughing but showing that he meant it
Justdont be wicked again Thats much better than confession
But I must confess insisted she
I had evil illust
caption   Would you like to think I was marrying you for what you haveor for any other reason whatever but for what you are
 thoughts evil suspicions about you
Ive had them all dayuntil you came
As soon as I saw you I felt bowed into the dust
A man like you doing anything so vulgar as I suspected you ofoh dearest Im SO ashamed
He put his arms round her and drew her to his shoulder
And the scene of mimicry in his office flashed into his mind and the blood burned in his cheeks
But he had no such access of insanity as to entertain the idea of confession
It was that typewriter girl continued Josephine
She drew away again and once more searched his face
You told me she was homely
Not exactly that
Insignificant then
Isnt she
Yesin a way said Josephine the condescending note in her voice againand in his mind Miss Hallowells clever burlesque of that note
But in another way Men are different from women
Now Ia woman of my sortcouldnt stoop to a man of her class
But men seem not to feel that way
No said he irritated
Theyve the courage to take what they want wherever they find it
A man will take gold out of the dirt because gold is always gold
But a woman waits until she can get it at a fashionable jewelers and makes sure its made up in a fashionable way
I dont like to hear YOU say those things
Her eyes flashed
Then you DO like that Hallowell girl
she criedand never before had her voice jarred upon him
That Hallowell girl has nothing to do with this he rejoined
I like to feel that you really love me that youd have taken me wherever you happened to find meand that youd stick to me no matter how far I might drop
I would
I would
she cried tears in her eyes
Oh I didnt mean that Fred
You know I didnt dont you
She tried to put her arms round his neck but he took her hands and held them
Would you like to think I was marrying you for what you haveor for any other reason whatever but for what you are
It being once more a question of her own sex the obstinate line appeared round her mouth
But Fred Id not be ME if I werea working girl she replied
You might be something even better if you were retorted he coldly
The only qualities I dont like about you are the surface qualities that have been plated on in these surroundings
And if I thought it was anything but just you that I was marrying Id lose no time about leaving you
Id not let myself degrade myself
Fredthat toneand dontplease dont look at me like that
she begged
But his powerful glance searched on
He said Is it possible that you and I are deceiving ourselvesand that well marry and wake upand be bored and dissatisfiedlike so many of our friends
Nono she cried wildly agitated
Fred dear we love each other
You know we do
I dont use words as well as you doand my mind works in a queer way Perhaps I didnt mean what I said
No matter
If my love were put to the testFred I dont ask anything more than that your love for me would stand the tests my love for you would stand
He caught her in his arms and kissed her with more passion than he had ever felt for her before
I believe you Jo he said
I believe you
I love you sothat I could be jealous even of herof that little girl in your office
Fred I didnt confess all the truth
It isnt true that I thought her a nobody
When she first came in hereit was in this very roomI thought she was as near nothing as any girl Id ever seen
Then she began to change as you said
Andoh dearest I cant help hating her
And when I tried to get her away from you and she wouldnt come Away from me
he cried laughing
I felt as if it were like that she pleaded
And she wouldnt comeand treated me as if she were queen and I servantonly politely I must say for Heaven knows I dont want to injure her Shall I have her discharged
Fred
exclaimed she indignantly
Do you think I could do such a thing
Shed easily get another job as good
Tetlow can find her one
Does that satisfy you
No she confessed
It makes me feel meaner than ever
Now Jo lets drop this foolish seriousness about nothing at all
Lets drop it for good
Nothing at allthats exactly it
I cant understand Fred
What is there about her that makes her haunt me
That makes me afraid shell haunt you
Norman felt a sudden thrill
He tightened his hold upon her hands because his impulse had been to release them
How absurd
he said rather noisily
Isnt it though
echoed she
Think of you and me almost quarreling about such a trivial person
Her laugh died away
She shivered cried Fred Im superstitious about her
ImImAFRAID
And she flung herself wildly into his arms
She IS somewhat uncanny said he with a lightness he was far from feeling
But dearit isnt complimentary to me is it
Forgive me dearestI dont mean that
I couldnt mean that
ButI LOVE you so
Ever since I began to love you Ive been looking round for something to be afraid of
And this is the first chance youve given me
IVE given you
mocked he
She laughed hysterically
I mean the first chance Ive had
And Im doing the best I can with it
They were in good spirits now and for the rest of the evening were as loverlike as always the nearer together for the bit of rough sea they had weathered so nicely
Neither spoke of Miss Hallowell
Each had privately resolved never to speak of her to the other again
Josephine was already regretting the frankness that had led her to expose a not too attractive part of herselfand to exaggerate in his eyes the importance of a really insignificant chit of a typewriter
When he went to bed that night he was resolved to have Tetlow find Miss Hallowell a job in another office
She certainly IS uncanny he said to himself
I wonder whyI wonder what the secret of her is
Shes the first woman I ever ran across who had a real secret
IS it real
I wonder
V TOWARD noon the following day Norman suddenly in need of a stenographer sent out for Miss Purdy one of the three experts at eighteen dollars a week who did most of the important and very confidential work for the heads of the firm
When his door opened again he saw not Miss Purdy but Miss Hallowell
Miss Purdy is sick today said she
Mr Tetlow wishes to know if I would do
Norman shifted uneasily in his chair
Just as wellperfectlycertainly he stammered
He was not looking at herseemed wholly occupied with the business he was preparing to dispatch
She seated herself in the usual place at the opposite side of the broad table
With pencil poised she fixed her gaze upon the unmarred page of her open notebook
Instead of abating his confusion increased
He could not think of the subject about which he wished to dictate
First he noted how long her lashes wereand darker than her hair as were her welldrawn eyebrows also
Never had he seen so white a skin or one so smooth
She happened to be wearing a blouse with a Dutch neck that day
What a superb throat
What a line of beauty its gently swelling curve made
Then his glance fell upon her lips rosyred slightly pouted
And what masses of dead gold hairno not gold but of the whitegray of wood ashes and tinted with gold
No wonder it was difficult to tell just what color her hair was
Hair like that was ready to be of any color
And there were her arms so symmetrical in her rather tight sleeves and emerging into view in the most delicate wrists
What a marvelous skin
Have you ever posed
She startled and the color flamed in her cheeks
Her eyes shot a glance of terror at him
II she stammered
Then almost defiantly Yes I didfor a while
But I didnt suppose anyone knew
At the time we needed the money badly
Norman felt deep disgust with himself for bursting out with such a question and for having surprised her secret
Theres nothing to be ashamed of he said gently
Oh Im not ashamed she returned
Her agitation had subsided
The only reason I quit was because the work was terribly hard and the pay small and uncertain
I was confused because they discharged me at the last place I had when they found out I had been a model
It was a church paper office
Again she poised her pencil and lowered her eyes
But he did not take the hint
Is there anything you would rather do than this sort of work
he asked
Nothing I could afford replied she
If you had been kind to Miss Burroughs yesterday she would have helped you
I couldnt afford to do that said the girl in her quiet reticent way
To do what
To be nice to anyone for what I could get out of it
Norman smiled somewhat cynically
Probably the girl fancied she was truthful but human beings rarely knew anything about their real selves
What would you like to do
She did not answer his question until she had shrunk completely within herself and was again thickly veiled with the expression which made everyone think her insignificant
Nothing I could afford to do said she
It was plain that she did not wish to be questioned further along that line
The stage
he persisted
I hadnt thought of it was her answer
What then
I dont think about things I cant have
I never made any definite plans
But isnt it a good idea always to look ahead
As long as one has to be moving one might as well move in a definite direction
She was waiting with pencil poised
There isnt much of a future at this business
She shrank slightly
He felt that she regarded his remark as preparation for a kindly hint that she was not giving satisfaction



Well why not leave it that way
Perhaps she would quit of her own accord would spare him the troubleand embarrassmentof arranging with Tetlow for another place for her
He began to dictategave her a few sentences mockingly different from his usual terse and clear statements interrupted himself with You misunderstood me a while ago
I didnt mean you werent doing your work well
On the contrary I think youll soon be expert
But I thought perhaps I might be able to help you to something youd like better
He listened to his own words in astonishment
What new freak of madness was this
Instead of clearing himself of this uncanny girl he was proposing things to her that would mean closer relations
And what reason had he to think she was fitted for anything but just what she was now doingdoing indifferently well
Thank you she said so quietly that it seemed coldly but Im satisfied as I am
Her manner seemed to say with polite and restrained plainness that she was not in the least appreciative of his interest or of himself
But this could not be
No girl in her position could fail to be grateful for his interest
No woman in all his life had ever failed to respond to his slightest advance
No it simply could not be
She was merely shy and had a peculiar way of showing it
He said You have no ambition
Thats not for a woman
She was making her replies as brief as civility permitted
He observed her narrowly
She was not shy not embarrassed
What kind of game was this
It could not be in sincere nature for a person in her position thus to treat overtures friendly and courteous overtures from one in his position
And never before neverhad a woman been thus unresponsive
Instead of feeling relief that she had disentangled him from the plight into which his impulsive offer had flung him he was piquedangeredand his curiosity was inflamed as never before about any woman
The relations of the sexes are for the most part governed by traditions of sex allurements and sex tricks so ancient that they have ceased to be conscious and have become instinctive
One of these venerable first principles is that mystery is the arch provoker
Norman an old and expert student of the great gamethe only game for which the staidest and most serious will abandon all else to follow its merry callNorman knew this trick of mystery
The woman veils herself and makes believe to flyan excellent trick as good today as ever after five thousand years of service
And he knew that in it lay the explanation for the sudden and high upflaming of his interest in this girl
What an ass Im making of myself
reflected he
When I care nothing about the girl why should I care about the mystery of her
Of course its some poor little affair a puzzle not worth puzzling out
All true and clear enough
Yet seeing it did not abate his interest a particle
She had veiled herself she was pretendingperhaps honestlyto fly
He rose and went to the window stood with his back to her resumed dictating
But the sentences would not come
He whirled abruptly
Im not ready to do the thing yet he said
Ill send for you later
Without a word or a glance she stood took her book and went toward the door
He gazed after her
He could not refrain from speaking again
Im afraid you misunderstood my offer a while ago said he neither curt nor friendly
I forgot how such things from a man to a young woman might be misinterpreted
I never thought of that replied she unembarrassed
It was simply that I cant put myself under obligation to anyone
As she stood there her full beauty flashed upon himthe exquisite form the subtly graceful poise of her body of her headthe loveliness of that golden hued white skinthe charm of her small rosy mouth the delicate sensitive slightly tilted noseand her eyes above all her eyesso clear so sweet
Her voice had seemed thin and faint to him its fineness now seemed the rarest delicacythe exactly fitting kind for so evasive and delicate a beauty as hers
He made a slight bow of dismissal turned abruptly away
Never in all his life strewn with gallant experiencesnever had a woman thus treated him and never had a woman thus affected him
I am madstark mad
he muttered
A tendollaraweek typewriter whom nobody on earth but myself would look at a second time
But something within him hurled back this scornful fling
Though no one else on earth saw or appreciatedwhat of it
She affected HIM thusand that was enough
I want her



I WANT her
I have never wanted a woman before
He rushed into the dressing room attached to his office plunged his face into icecold water
This somewhat eased the burning sensation that was becoming intolerable
Many were the unaccountable incidents in his acquaintance with this strange creature the most preposterous was this sudden seizure
He realized now that his feeling for her had been like the quiet steady imperceptible filling of a reservoir that suddenly announces itself by the thunder and roar of a mighty cascade over the dam
This is madnesssheer madness
I am still master within myself
I will make short work of this rebellion
And with an air of calmness so convincing that he believed in it he addressed himself to the task of sanity and wisdom lying plain before him
A man of my position caught by a girl like that
A man such as I am caught by ANY woman whatever
It was grotesque
He opened his door to summon Tetlow
The gate in the outside railing was directly opposite and about thirty feet away
Tetlow and Miss Hallowell were going outevidently to lunch together
She was looking up at the chief clerk with laughing eyesthey seemed coquettish to the infuriated Norman
And Tetlowthe serious and squab young ass was gazing at her with the expression men of the stupid squab sort put on when they wish to impress a woman
At this spectacle at the vision of that slim young loveliness that perfect form and deliciously smooth soft skin white beyond belief beneath its faintly golden tint the hot blood steamed up into Normans brain blinded his sight reddened it with desire and jealousy
He drew back closed his door with a bang
This is not I he muttered
What has happened
Am I insane
When Tetlow returned from lunch the office boy on duty at the gate told him that Mr Norman wished to see him at once
Like all men trying to advance along ways where their fellow men can help or hinder the head clerk was full of more or less clever little tricks thought out with a view to making a good impression
One of them was to stamp upon all minds his virtue of promptness of what use to be prompt unless you forced every one to feel how prompt you were
He went in to see Norman with hat in hand and overcoat on his back and one glove off the other still on
Norman was standing at a window smoking a cigarette
His appearance dress quite as much as mannerwas the envy of his subordinateas indeed it was of hundreds of the young men struggling to rise down town
It was so exactly what the appearance of a man of vigor and power and high position should be
Tetlow practiced it by the quarter hour before his glass at homenot without progress in the direction of a not unimpressive manner of his own
As Tetlow stood at attention Norman turned and advanced toward him
Mr Tetlow he began in his goodhumored voice with the never wholly submerged undernote of sharpness is it your habit to go out to lunch with the young ladies employed here
If so I wish to suggestsimply to suggestthat it may be bad for discipline
Tetlows jaw dropped a little
He looked at Norman was astonished to discover beneath a thin veneer of calm signs of greater agitation than he had ever seen in him
Today was the first time sir he said
And I cant quite account for my doing it
Miss Hallowell has been here several months
I never specially noticed her until the last few dayswhen the question of discharging her came up
You may remember it was settled by you
Norman flung his cigarette away and stalked to the window
Mr Norman pursued Tetlow you and I have been together many years
I esteem it my greatest honor that I am ablethat you permit meto class you as my friend
So Im going to give you a confidence one that really startles me
I called on Miss Hallowell last night
Normans back stiffened
She is even more charming in her own home
And Tetlow blushed and trembledI am going to make her my wife if I can
Norman turned a mocking satirical smile unpleasantly sparkling in his eyes and curling his mouth Old man he said I think youve gone crazy
Tetlow made a helpless gesture
I think so myself
I didnt intend to marry for ten yearsand then I had quite a different match in mind
Whats the matter with you Billy
inquired Norman inspecting him with smiling cruelly unfriendly eyes
Im damned if I know Norman said the head clerk assuming that his friend was sympathetic and dropping into the informality of the old days when they were clerks together in a small firm
Id have proposed to her last night if I hadnt been afraid Id lose her by being in such a hurry



Youre in love yourself
Norman startled violently
Youre going to get married
Probably you can sympathize
You know how it is to meet the woman you want and must have
Norman turned away
Ive hador thought I hadrather advanced ideas on the subject of women
Ive always had a horror of being married for a living or for a home or as an experiment or a springboard
My notions been that I wouldnt trust a woman who wasnt independent
And theoretically I still think thats sound
But it doesnt work out in practice
A man has to have been in love to be able to speak the last word on the sex question
Norman dropped heavily into his desk chair and rumpled his hair into disorder
He muttered something the head clerk thought it was an oath
Id marry her Tetlow went on if I knew she was simply using me in the coldest most calculating way
My only fear is that I shant be able to get her that she wont marry me
Norman sneered
Thats not likely he said
No it isnt admitted Tetlow
Theythe Hallowellsare nice peopleof as good family as there is
But theyre poorvery poor
Theres only her father and herself
The old man is a scientistspends most of his time at things that wont pay a centutterly impractical
A gentlemanan able man if a little crackedat least he seemed so to me who dont know much about scientific matters
But getting poorer steadily
So I think she will accept me
A gloomy angry frown like a black shadow passed across Normans face and disappeared
Youd marry heron those terms
he sneered
Of course I HOPE for better terms Norman sprang up strode to the window and turned his back
But Im prepared for the worst
The fact is she treats me as if she didnt care a rap for the honor of my showing her attention
A trick Billy
An old trick
Maybe so
But I really believe she doesnt realize
Shes queerhas been queerly brought up
Yes I think she doesnt appreciate
Then too shes young and lightalmost childish in some ways



I dont blame you for being disgusted with me Fred
But damn it whats a man to do
Cure himself
exploded Norman wheeling violently on his friend
You must act like a man
Billy such a marriage is ruin for you
How can we take you into partnership next year
When you marry you must marry in the class youre moving toward not in any of those youre leaving behind
Do you suppose I havent thought of all that
rejoined Tetlow bitterly
But I cant help myself
Its useless for me to say Ill try
I shant try
Dont you want to get over this
demanded Norman fiercely
Of course NoI dont
Fred youd think better of me if you knew her
Youve never especially noticed her
Shes beautiful
Norman dropped to his chair again
Reallybeautiful protested Tetlow assuming that the gesture was one of disgusted denial
Take a good look at her Norman before you condemn her
I never was so astonished as when I discovered how goodlooking she is
I dont quite know how it is but I suppose nobody ever happened to see howhow lovely she is until I just chanced to see it
At a rudely abrupt gesture from Norman he hurried on eagerly apologetic And if you talk with her Shes very reserved
But shes the lady through and through and has a good mind



At least I think she has
Ill admit a man in love is a poor judge of a womans mind
But anyhow I KNOW shes lovely to look at
Youll see it yourself now that Ive called your attention to it
You cant fail to see it
Norman threw himself back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head
WHY do you want to marry her
he inquired in a tone his sensitive ear approved as judicial
How can I tell
replied the head clerk irritably
Does a man ever know
Alwayswhen hes sensibly in love
But when hes just in love
Thats what ails me retorted Tetlow with a sheepish look and laugh
Billy youve got to get over this
I cant let you make a fool of yourself
Tetlows fat smooth pasty face of the overfed underexercised professional man became a curious exhibit of alarm and obstinacy
Youve got to promise me youll keep away from herexcept at the officefor say a week
Then well see
Tetlow debated
Its highly improbable that anyone else will discover these irresistible charms
Theres no one else hanging round
No one as I told you the other day when you questioned me about her
Norman shifted looked embarrassed
I hope I didnt give you the impression I was ashamed of loving her or would ever be ashamed of her anywhere
continued Tetlow a very loverlike light in his usually unromantic eyes
If I did it wasnt what I meantfar from it
Youll see when I marry her Norman
Youll be congratulating me
Norman sprang up again
This is plain lunacy Tetlow
I am amazed at youamazed
Get acquainted with her Mr Norman pleaded the subordinate
Do it to oblige me
Dont condemn us I wish to hear nothing more
cried Norman violently
Another thing
You must find her a place in some other officeat once
Youre right sir assented Tetlow
I can readily do that
Norman scowled at him made an imperious gesture of dismissal
Tetlow chopfallen but obdurate got himself speedily out of sight
Norman with hands deep in his pockets stared out among the skyscrapers and gave way to a fit of remorse
It was foreign to his nature to do petty underhanded tricks
Grand strategyyes
At that he was an adept and not the shiftiest craftiest schemes he had ever devised had given him a moments uneasiness
But to be driving a tendollaraweek typewriter out of her job to be maneuvering to deprive her of a for her brilliant marriageto be lying to an old and loyal retainer who had helped Norman full as much and as often as Norman had helped himthese sneaking bits of skullduggery made him feel that he had sunk indeed
But he ground his teeth together and his eyes gleamed wickedly
He shant have her damn him
he muttered
Shes not for him
He summoned Tetlow who was obviously low in mind as the result of revolving the things that had been said to him
Billy he began in a tone so amiable that he was ashamed for himself youll not forget I have your promise
What did I promise
cried Tetlow his voice shrill with alarm
Not to see her except at the office for a week
But Ive promised her father Id call this evening
Hes going to show me some experiments
You can easily make an excusebusiness
But I dont want to protested the head clerk
Whats the use
Ive got my mind made up
Norman Id hang on after her if you fired me out of this office for it
And I cant restIm fit for nothing until this matters settled
I came very near taking her aside and proposing to her just after I went out of here a while ago
You DAMN fool
cried Norman losing all control of himself
Take the afternoon express for Albany instead of Harcott and attend to those registrations and arrange for those hearings
Ill do my best to save you
Ill bring the girl in here and keep her at work until you get out of the way
Tetlow glanced at his friend then the tears came into his eyes
Youre a hell of a friend
he ejaculated
And I thought youd sympathize because you were in love
I do sympathize Billy Norman replied with an abrupt change to shamefaced apology
I sympathize more than you know
I feel like a dog doing this
But it cant result in any harm and I want you to get a little fresh air in that hot brain of yours before you commit yourself
Be reasonable old man
Suppose you rushed ahead and proposedand she acceptedand then after a few days you came to
What about her
You must act on the level Tetlow
Do the fair thing by yourself and by her
Norman had often had occasion to feel proud of the ingenuity and resourcefulness of his brain
He had never been quite so proud as he was when he finished that speech
It pacified Tetlow it lightened his own sense of guilt it gave him a respite
Tetlow rewarded Norman with the look that in New York is the equivalent of the handclasp friend seeks from friend in times of stress
Youre right Fred
Im much obliged to you
I havent been considering HER side of it enough
A man ought always to think of that
The womenpoor thingshave a hard enough time to get on at best
Normans smile was characteristically cynical
Sentimentality amused him
I doubt if there are more female wrecks than male wrecks scattered about the earth rejoined he
And I suspect the fact isnt due to the gentleness of man with woman either
Dont fret for the ladies Tetlow
They know how to take care of themselves
They know how to milk with a sure and a steady hand
You may find it out by depressing experience some day
Tetlow saw the aim
His obstinate wretched expression came back
I dont care
Ive got You went over that ground interrupted Norman impatiently
Youd better be catching the train
As Tetlow withdrew he rang for an office boy and sent him to summon Miss Hallowell
Norman had been reasoning with himselfwith the aid of the self that was both better and more worldly wise
He felt that his wrestlings had not been wholly futile
He believed he had got the strength to face the girl with a respectful mind with a mind resolute in dutyif not lovetoward Josephine Burroughs
I LOVE Josephine he said to himself
My feeling for this girl is some sort of physical attraction
I certainly shall be able to control it enough to keep it within myself
And soon it will die out
No doubt Ive felt much the same thing as strongly before
But it didnt take hold because I was never bound beforenever had the sense of the necessity for restraint
That sense is always highly dangerous for my sort of man
This sounded well
He eyed the entering girl coldly said in a voice that struck him as excellent indifference Bring your machine in here Miss Hallowell and recopy these papers
Ive made some changes
If you spoil any sheets dont throw them away but return everything to me
Im always careful about the wastepaper baskets said she since they warned me that there are men who make a living searching the waste thrown out of offices
He made no reply
He could not have spoken if he had tried
Once more the spell had seized himthe spell of her weird fascination for him
As she sat typewriting with her back almost toward him he sat watching her and analyzing his own folly
He knew that diagnosing a disease does not cure it but he found an acute pleasure in lingering upon all the details of the effect she had upon his nerves
He did not dare move from his desk from the position that put a huge table and a revolving case of reference books between them
He believed that if he went nearer he would be unable to resist seizing her in his arms and pouring out the passion that was playing along his nerves as the delicate intense flame flits back and forth along the surface of burning alcohol
A knock at the door
He plunged into his papers
Come
he called
Tetlow thrust in his head
Miss Hallowell did not look up
Im off the head clerk said
His gaze was upon the unconscious girla gaze that filled Norman with longing to strangle him
Telegraph me from Albany as soon as you get there said Norman
Telegraph me at my club
Tetlow was gone
The machine tapped monotonously on
The barette which held the girls hair at the back was so high that the full beauty of the nape of her neck was revealed
That wonderful white skin with the golden tint
How softyet how firmher flesh looked
How slender yet how strong was her build How do you like Tetlow
he asked because speak to her he must
She glanced up turned in her chair
He quivered before the gaze from those enchanting eyes of hers
I beg pardon she said
I didnt hear
Tetlowhow do you like him
He is very kind to meto everyone
How did your father like him
He confidently expected some sign of confusion but there was no sign
Father was delighted with him she said merrily
He took an interest in the work fathers doingand that was enough
She was about to turn back to her task
He hastened to ask another question
Couldnt I meet your father some time
What Tetlow told me interested me greatly
Father would be awfully pleased replied she
Butunless you really care aboutbiology I dont think youd like coming
Im interested in everything interesting replied Norman dizzily
What was he saying
What was he doing
What folly was his madness plunging him into
You can come with Mr Tetlow when he gets back
Id prefer to talk with him alone said Norman
Perhaps I might see some way to be of service to him
Her expression was vividly different from what it had been when he offered to help HER
She became radiant with happiness
I do hope youll come she said her voice very low and sweet in the effort she was making to restrain yet express her feelings
When
This evening
Hes always at home
Youll be there
Im always there too
We have no friends
Its not easy to make acquaintances in the Eastcongenial acquaintances
Id want you to be there he explained with great care because you could help him and me in getting acquainted
Oh hell talk freelyto anyone
He talks only the one subject
He never thinks of anything else
She was resting her crossed arms on the back of her chair and with her chin upon them was looking at him a childlike pose and a childlike expression
He said You are SURE you are twenty
She smiled gayly
Nearly twentyone
Old enough to be in love
She lifted her head and laughed
She had charming white teethsmall and sharp and with enough irregularity to carry out her general suggestion of variability
Yes I shall like that when it comes she said But the chances are against it just now
Theres Tetlow
She was much amused
Oh hes far too old and serious
Norman felt depressed
Why hes only thirtyfive
But Im not twentyone she reminded him
Id want some one of my own age
Im tired of being so solemn
If I had love Id expect it to change all that
Evidently a forlorn and foolish personand doubtless thinking of him two years the senior of Tetlow and far more serious as an elderly person in the same class with her father
But you like biology
he said
The way to a cure was to make her talk on
I dont know anything about it said she looking as frivolous as a butterfly or a breezebobbed blossom
I listen to father but its all beyond me
Yesa lightweight
They could have nothing in common
She was a mere surfacea thrillingly beautiful surface but not a fullfledged woman
So little did conversation with him interest her she had taken advantage of the short pause to resume her work
No she had not the faintest interest in him
It wasnt a trick of coquetry it was genuine
He whom women had always bowed before was unable to arouse in her a spark of interest
She cared neither for what he had nor for what he was in himself
This offended and wounded him
He struggled sulkily with his papers for half an hour
Then he fell to watching her again and You must not neglect to give me your address he said
Write it on a slip of paper after you finish
I might forget it
Very well she replied but did not turn round
Why do you think did Tetlow come to see you
he asked
He felt cheapened in his own eyeshe the great man the arrived man the fiance of Josephine Burroughs engaged in this halting and sneaking flirtation
But he could not restrain himself
She turned to answer
Mr Tetlow works very hard and has few friends
He had heard of my father and wanted to meet himjust like you
Naturally murmured Norman in confusion
I thoughtperhapshe was interested in YOU
She laughed outrightand he had an entrancing view of the clean rosy interior of her mouth
In ME
Mr Tetlow
Why hes too serious and important for a girl like me
Then he bored you
Oh no
I like him
He is a good man thoroughly good
This pleased Norman immensely
It may be fine to be good but to be called goodthat is somehow a different matter
It removes a man at once from the jealousyprovoking class
Good exactly describes him said Norman
He wouldnt harm a fly
In love hed be ridiculous
Not with a woman of his own age and kind protested she
But Im neglecting my work
And she returned to it with a resolute manner that made him ashamed to interrupt againespecially after the unconscious savage rebukes she had administered
He sat there fighting against the impulse to watch her denouncing himselfappealing to pride to shame to prudenceto his love for Josephineto the sense of decency that restrains a hunter from aiming at a harmless tame song bird
But all in vain
He concentrated upon her at last stared miserably at her filled with longing and dread and shameand longing and yet more longing
When she finished and stood at the other side of the desk waiting for him to pass upon her work she must have thought he was in a profound abstraction
He did not speak made a slight motion with his hand to indicate that she was to go
Shut in alone he buried his face in his arms
What madness
he groaned
If I loved her thered be some excuse for me
But I dont
I couldnt
Yet I seem ready to ruin everything merely to gratify a selfish whiman insane whim
On top of the papers she had left he saw a separate slip
He drew it toward him spread it out before him
Her address
An unknown street in Jersey City
Ill not go he said aloud pushing the slip away
Go
Certainly not
He had never really meant to go
He would of course keep his engagement with Josephine
And Ill not come down town until she has taken another job and has caught Tetlow
Ill stop this idiocy of trying to make an impression on a person not worth impressing
What weak vanityto be piqued by this girls lack of interest
Neverthelesshe at six oclock telephoned to the Burroughs house that he was detained down town
He sent away his motor dined alone in the station restaurant in Jersey City
And at half past seven he set out in a cab in search ofwhat
He did not dare answer that interrogation
VI LIFE many another chance explorer from New York Norman was surprised to discover that within a few minutes of leaving the railway station his cab was moving through a not unattractive city
He expected to find the Hallowells in a tenement in some more or less squalid street overhung with railway smoke and bedaubed with railway grime
He was delighted when the driver assured him that there was no mistake that the comfortable little cottage across the width of the sidewalk and a small front yard was the soughtfor destination
Wait please he said to the cabman
Or if you like you can go to that corner saloon down there
Ill know where to find you
And he gave him half a dollar
The cabman hesitated between two theories of this conductwhether it was the generosity it seemed or was a ruse to side step payment
Heor his thirst decided for the decency of human nature he drove confidingly away
Norman went up the tiny stoop and rang
The sound of a piano in the room on the ground floor where there was light abruptly ceased
The door opened and Miss Hallowell stood before him
She was throughout a different person from the girl of the office
She had changed to a tightfitting paleblue linen dress made all in one piece
Norman could now have not an instants doubt about the genuineness the bewitching actuality of her beauty
The wonder was how she could contrive to conceal so much of it for the purposes of business
It was a peculiar kind of beautynot the radiant kind but that which shines with a soft glow and gives him who sees it the delightful sense of being its original and sole discoverer
An artistic eyeor an eye that discriminates in and responds to feminine lovelinesswould have been captivated as it searched in vain for flaw
If Norman anticipated that she would be nervous before the task of receiving in her humbleness so distinguished a visitor he must have been straightway disappointed
Whether from a natural lack of that sense of social differences which is developed to the most pitiful snobbishness in New York or from her youth and inexperience she received him as if he had been one of the neighbors dropping in after supper
And it was Norman who was ill at ease
Nothing is more disconcerting to a man accustomed to be received with due respect to his importance than to find himself put upon the common human level and compelled to make good all over again from the beginning
He felt he knewthat he was an humble candidate for her favora candidate with the chances perhaps against him
The tiny parlor had little in it beside the upright piano because there was no space
But the paper the carpet and curtains the few pieces of furniture showed no evidence of bad taste of painful failure at the effort to make a front
He was in the home of poor people but they were obviously people who made a highly satisfactory best of their poverty
And in the midst of it all the girl shone like the one evening star in the mystic opalescence of twilight
We werent sure you were coming said she
Ill call father



No Ill take you back to his workshop
Hes easier to get acquainted with there
Wont you play something for me first
Or perhaps you sing 
A very little she admitted
Not worth hearing
Im sure Id like it
I want to get used to my surroundings before I tackle thethe biology
Without either hesitation or shyness she seated herself at the piano
Ill sing the song Ive just learned
And she began
Norman moved to the chair that gave him a view of her in profile
For the next five minutes he was witness to one of those rare altogether charming visions that linger in the memory in freshness and fragrance until memory itself fades away
She sat very straight at the piano and the position brought out all the long lines of her figurethe long round white neck and throat the long back and bosom the long arms and legsa series of lovely curves
It has been scientifically demonstrated that pale blue is pre eminently the sex color
It certainly was preeminently HER color setting off each and every one of her charms and suggesting the roundness and softness and whiteness her drapery concealed
She was one of those rare beings whose every pose is instinct with grace
And her voice It was small rather high at times almost shrill
But in every note of its register there sounded a mysterious melancholysweet call to the responding nerves of man
Before she got halfway through the song Norman was fighting against the same mad impulse that had all but overwhelmed him as he watched her in the afternoon
And when her last note rose swelled slowly faded into silence it seemed to him that had she kept on for one note more he would have disclosed to her amazed eyes the insanity raging within him
She turned on the piano stool her hands dropped listlessly in her lap
Arent those words beautiful
she said in a dreamy voice
She was not looking at him
Evidently she was hardly aware of his presence
He had not heard a word
He was in no mood for mere words
Ive never liked anything so well he said
And he lowered his eyes that she might not see what they must be revealing
She rose
He made a gesture of protest
Wont you sing another
he asked
Not after that she said
Its the best I know
It has put me out of the mood for the ordinary songs
You are a dreamerarent you
Thats my real life replied she
I go through the other part just to get to the dreams
What do you dream
She laughed carelessly
Oh youd not be interested
It would seem foolish to you
Youre mistaken there cried he
The only thing that ever has interested me in life is dreams and making them come true
But not MY kind of dreams
The only kind I like are the ones that couldnt possibly come true
There isnt any dream that cant be made to come true
She looked at him eagerly
You think so
The wildest ones are often the easiest
He had a moving voice himself and it had been known to affect listening ears hypnotically when he was deeply in earnest was possessed by one of those desires that conquer men of will and then make them irresistible instruments
What is your dreamhappiness



love
She gazed past him with swimming eyes with a glance that seemed like a brave bright bird exploring infinity
Yes she said under her breath
But it could nevernever come true
Its too perfect
Dont doubt he said in a tone that fitted her mood as the rhythm of the cradle fits the gentle breathing of the sleeping child
Dont ever doubt
And the dream will come true
You have been in love
she said under the spell of his look and tone
He nodded slowly
I am he replied and he was under the spell of her beauty
Is itwonderful
Like nothing else on earth
Everything else seems poor and cheapbeside it
He drew a step nearer
But you couldnt love not yet he said
You havent had the experience
You will have to learn
You dont know me she cried
I have been teaching myself ever since I was a little girl
Ive thought of nothing else most of the time
Oh she clasped her white hands against her small bosomif I ever have the chance how much I shall give
I know it
I know it
he replied
You will make some man happier than ever man was before
His infatuation did not blind him to the fact that she cared nothing about him looked on him in the most unpersonal way
But that knowledge seemed only to inflame him the more to lash him on to the folly of an illtimed declaration
I have felt how much you will givehow much you will loveIve felt it from the second time I saw youperhaps from the first
Ive never seen any woman who interested me as you do who drew me as you doagainst my ambitionagainst my will
II He had been fighting against the words that would come in spite of him
He halted now because the food of emotion suffocated speech
He stood before her ghastly pale and trembling
She did not draw back
She seemed compelled by his will by the force of his passion to stay where she was
But in her eyes was a fascinated terrora fear of himof the passion that dominated him a passion like the devils that made men gash themselves and leap from precipices into the sea
To unaccustomed eyes the first sight of passion is always terrifying and is usually repellent
One must learn to adventure the big wave the great hissing towering billow that conceals behind its menace the wild rapture of infinite longing realized
I have frightened you
he said
Yes was her whispered reply
But it is your dream come true
She shrank backnot in aversion but gently
No it isnt my dream she replied
You dont realize it yet but you will
She shook her head positively
I couldnt ever think of you in that way
He did not need to ask why
She had already explained when they were talking of Tetlow
There was a finality in her tone that filled him with despair
It was his turn to look at her in terror
What power this slim delicate girl had over him
What a price she could exact if she but knew
Knew
Why he had told herwas telling her in look and tone and gesture was giving himself frankly into captivitywas prostrate inviting her to trample
His only hope of escape lay in her inexperiencethat she would not realize
In the insanities of passion as in some other forms of dementia there is always left a streak of reasonof that craft which leads us to try to get what we want as cheaply as possible
Men all but beside themselves with love will bargain over the terms if they be of the bargaining kind by nature
Norman was not a haggler
But common prudence was telling him how unwise his conduct was how he was inviting the defeat of his own purposes
He waved his hand impatiently
Well see my dear he said with a light goodhumored laugh
I mustnt forget that I came to see your father
She looked at him doubtfully
She did not understand did not quite likethis abrupt change of mood
It suggested to her simplicity a lack of seriousness of sincerity
Do you really wish to see my father
she inquired
Why else should I come away over to Jersey City
Couldnt I have talked with you at the office
This seemed convincing
She continued to study his face for light upon the real character of this strange new sort of man
He regarded her with a friendly humorous twinkle in his eyes
Then Ill take you to him she said at length
She was by no means satisfied but she could not discover why she was dissatisfied
I cant possibly do you any harm he urged with raillery
No I think not replied she gravely
But you mustnt say those things
Why not
Into his eyes came their strongest most penetrating look
I want you
And I dont intend to give you up
It isnt my habit to give up
So sooner or later I get what I go after
You make meafraid she said nervously
Of what
laughed he
Not of me certainly
Then it must be of yourself
You are afraid you will end by wanting me to want you
Nonot that declared she confused by his quick cleverness of speech
I dont know what Im afraid of
Then lets go to your father



Youll not tell Tetlow what Ive said
No
And once more her simple negation gave him a sense of her absolute truthfulness
Or that Ive been here
She looked astonished
Why not
Ohoffice reasons
It wouldnt do for the others to know
She reflected on this
I dont understand was the result of her thinking
But Ill do as you ask
Only you must not come again
Why not
If they knew at the office theyd simply talkunpleasantly
Yes she admitted hesitatingly after reflecting
So you mustnt come again
I dont like some kinds of secrets
But your father will know he urged
Isnt that enough forfor propriety
I cant explain
I dont understand myself
I do a lot of things by instinct
She standing with her hands behind her back and with clear childlike eyes gravely upon him looked puzzled but resolved
And my instinct tells me not to do anything secret about you
This answer made him wonder whether after all he might not be too positive in his derisive disbelief in womens instincts
He laughed
Wellnow for your father
The workshop proved to be an annex to the rear reached by a passage leading past a cosy little dining room and a kitchen where the order and the shine of cleanness were notable even to masculine eyes
You are well taken care of he said to hershe was preceding him to show the way
We take care of ourselves replied she
I get breakfast before I leave and supper after I come home
Father has a cold lunch in the middle of the day when he eats at allwhich isnt often
And on Saturday afternoons and Sundays I do the heavy work
You ARE a busy lady
Oh not so very busy
Father is a crank about system and order
He has taught me to plan everything and work by the plans
For the first time Norman had a glimmer of real interest in meeting her father
For in those remarks of hers he recognized at once the rare superior man the man who works by plan where the masses of mankind either drift helplessly or are propelled by some superior force behind them without which they would be not the civilized beings they seem but even as the savage in the dugout or as the beast of the field
The girl opened a door a bright light streamed into the dim hallway
Father
she called
Heres Mr
Norman
Norman saw beyond the exquisite profile of the girls head and figure a lean tallish old man dark and gray whose expression proclaimed him at first glance no more in touch with the affairs of active life in the world than had he been an inhabitant of Mars
Mr Hallowell gave his caller a polite glance and handshakeevidence of merest surface interest in him of amiable patience with an intruder
Norman saw in the neatness of his clothing and linen further proof of the girls loving care
For no such abstracted personality as this would ever bother about such things for himself
These details however detained Norman only for a moment
In the presence of Hallowell it was impossible not to concentrate upon him
As we grow older what we are inside the kind of thoughts we admit as our intimates appears ever more strongly in the countenance
This had often struck Norman observing the men of importance about him noting how as they aged the look of respectability of intellectual distinction became a thinner and ever thinner veneer over the selfishness and greediness the vanity and sensuality and falsehood
But never before had he been so deeply impressed by its truth
Evidently Hallowell during most of his fiftyfive or sixty years had lived the purely intellectual life
The result was a look of spiritual beauty the look of the soul living in the high mountain with serenity and vast views constantly before it
Such a face fills with awe the ordinary follower of the petty life of the world if he have the brains to know or to suspect the ultimate truth about existence
It filled Norman with awe
He hastily turned his eyes upon the girland once more into his face came the resolute intense whitehot expression of a man doggedly set upon an earthy purpose
There was an embarrassed silence
Then the girl said Show him the worms father
Mr Hallowell smiled
My little girl thinks no one has seen that sort of thing said he
I cant make her believe it is one of the commonplaces
Youve never had anyone here more ignorant than I sir said Norman
The only claim on your courtesy I can make is that Im interested and that I perhaps know enough in a general way to appreciate
Hallowell waved his hand toward a row of large glass bottles on one of the many shelves built against the rough walls of the room
Here they are said he
Its the familiar illustration of how life may be controlled
I dont understand said Norman eying the bottled worms curiously
Oh its simply the demonstration that life is a mere chemical process Norman had ceased to listen
The girl was moving toward the door by which they had enteredwas in the doorwaywas gone
He stood in an attitude of attention Hallowell talked on and on passing from one thing to another forgetting his caller and himself thinking only of the subject the beloved science that has brought into the modern world a type of men like those who haunted the deserts and mountain caves in the days when Rome was falling to pieces
With those saintly hermits of the Dark Ages religion was the all absorbing subject
And seeking their own salvation was the goal upon which their ardent eyes were necessarily bent
With these modern devotees sciencethe search for the truth about the world in which they live is their religion and their goal is the redemption of the world
They are resolvedstep by step each worker contributing his mite of discoveryto transform the world from a hell of discomfort and pain and death to a heaven where men and women free and enlightened and perhaps immortal shall live in happiness
They even dream that perhaps this race of gods shall learn to construct the means to take them to another and younger planet when this Earth has become too old and too cold and too nakedly clad in atmosphere properly to sustain life
From time to time Norman caught a few words of what Hallowell saidwords that made him respect the intelligence that had uttered them
But he neither cared nor dared to listen
He refused to be deflected from his one purpose
When he was as old as Hallowell it would be time to think of these matters
When he had snatched the things he needed it would be time to take the generous wide philosopher view of life
But not yet
He was still young he couldand he woulddrink of the sparkling heady life of the senses typefied now for him in this girl
How her loveliness flamed in his bloodflamed as fiercely when he could not see the actual tangible charms as when they were radiating their fire into his eyes and through his skin
First he must live that glorious life of youth of nerves aquiver with ecstasy
Also he must shut out the things of the intellectmust live in brain as well as in body the animal lifein brain the life of cunning and strategy
For the intellectual life would make it impossible to pursue such ignoble things
First material success and material happiness
Then in its own time this intellectual life to which such men as Hallowell ever beckon from their heights such men as Norman deep in the wallow that seems to them unworthy of them even as they roll in it
As soon as there came a convenient pause in Hallowells talk Norman said And you devote your whole life to these things
Hallowells countenance lost its fine glow of enthusiasm
I have to make a living
I do chemical analyses for doctors and druggists
That takes most of my time
But you can dispatch those things quickly
Hallowell shook his head
Theres only one way to do things
My clients trust me
I cant shirk
Norman smiled
He admired this simplicity
But it amused him too in a world of shirking and shuffling not to speak of downright dishonesty it struck the humorous note of the incongruous
He said But if you could give all your time you would get on faster
Yesif I had the timeAND the money
To make the search exhaustive would take moneyfive or six thousand a year at the least
A great deal more than I shall ever have
Have you tried to interest capitalists
Hallowell smiled ironically
There is much talk about capitalists and capital opening up things
But I have yet to learn of an instance of their touching anything until they were absolutely sure of large profits
Their failed enterprises are not miscarriage of noble purpose but mistaken judgment judgment blinded by hope and greed
I see that a philosopher can know life without living it said Norman
But couldnt you put your scheme in such a way that some capitalist would be led to hope
Id have to tell them the truth
Possibly I might discover something with commercial value but I couldnt promise
I dont think it is likely
Normans eyes were on the door
His thoughts were reaching out to the distant and faint sound of a piano
Just what do you propose to search for
inquired he
He tried to listen because it was necessary that he have some knowledge of Hallowells plans
But he could not fix his attention
After a few moments he glanced at his watch interrupted with I think I understand enough for the present
Ive stayed longer than I intended
I must go now
When I come again I may perhaps have some plan to propose
Plan
exclaimed Hallowell his eyes lighting up
Im not surenot at all sure hastily added Norman
I dont wish to give you false hopes
The matter is extremely difficult
But Ill try
Ive small hope of success but Ill try
My daughter didnt explain to me said the scientist
She simply said one of the gentlemen for whom she worked was coming to look at my place
I thought it was mere curiosity
So it was Mr Hallowell said Norman
But I have been interested
I dont as yet see what can be done
Im only saying that Ill think it over
I understand said Hallowell
He was trying to seem calm and indifferent
But his voice had the tremulous note of excitement in it and his hands fumbled nervously touching evidence of the agitated gropings of his mind in the faint perhaps illusory light of a new sprung hope
Yes I understand perfectly
Still it is pleasant to think about such a thing even if theres no chance of it
I am very fond of dreaming
That has been my life you know
Norman colored moved uneasily
The fineness of this mans character made him uncomfortable
He could pity Hallowell as a misguided failure
He could dilate himself as prosperous successful much the more imposing and important figure in the contrast
Yet there was somehow a point of view at which if one looked carefully his own sort of man shriveled and the Hallowell sort towered
I MUST be going Norman said
Nodont come with me
I know the way
Ive interrupted you long enough
And he put out his hand and by those little clevernesses of manner which he understood so well made it impossible for Hallowell to go with him to Dorothy
He was glad when he shut the door between him and her father
He paused in the hall to dispel the vague selfdebasing discomfortand listening to HER voice as she sang helped wonderfully
There is no more trying test of a personality than to be estimated by the voice alone
That test produces many strange and startling results
Again and again it completely reverses our judgment of the personality either destroys or enhances its charm
The voice of this girl floating out upon the quiet of the cottagethe voice soft and sweet full of the virginal passion of dreams unmarred by experience It was while listening to her voice as he stood there in the dimly lighted hall that Frederick Norman passed under the spell in all its potency
In taking an anaesthetic there is the stage when we reach out for its soothing effects then comes the stage when we half desire half fear then a stage in which fear is dominant and we struggle to retain our control of the senses
Last comes the stage when we feel the full power of the drug and relax and yield or are beaten down into quiet
Her voice drew him into the final stage was the blow of the overwhelming waves crest that crushed him into submission
She glanced toward the door
He was leaning there an ominous calm in his pale resolute face
She gazed at him with widening eyes
And her look was the look of helplessness before a force that may indeed must be struggled against but with the foregone certainty of defeat
A gleam of triumph shone in his eyes
Then his expression changed to one more conventional
I stopped a moment to listen on my way out said he
Her expression changed also
The instinctive probably unconscious response to his look faded into the sweet smile serious rather than merry that was her habitual greeting
Mr Tetlow didnt get away from father so soon
I stayed longer than I intended
I found it even more interesting than I had expected



Would you be glad if your father could be free to do as he likes and not be worried about anything
That is one of my dreams
Well its certainly one that might come true



And you Its a shame that you should have to do so much drudgeryboth here and in New York
Oh I dont mind about myself
Its all Im fit for
I havent any talentexcept for dreaming
And for makingSOME mans dreams come true
Her gaze dropped
And as she hid herself she looked once more almost as insignificant and colorless as he had once believed her to be
What are you thinking about
She shook her head slowly without raising her eyes or emerging from the deep recess of her reserve
You are a mystery to me
I cant decide whether you are very innocent or veryconcealing
She glanced inquiringly at him
I dont understand she said
He smiled
No more do I Ive seen so much of fakingin women as well as in menthat its hard for me to believe anyone is genuine
Do you think I am trying to deceive you
About what
He made an impatient gestureimpatience with his credulity where she was concerned
No matter
I want to make you happybecause I want you to make me happy
Her eyes became as grave as a wondering childs
You are laughing at me she said
Why do you say that
Because I could not make you happy
Why not
What could a serious man like you find in me
His intense burning gaze held hers
Some time I will tell you
She shut herself within herself like a flower folding away its beauty and leaving exposed only the underside of its petals
It was impossible to say whether she understood or was merely obeying an instinct
He watched her a moment in silence
Then he said I am mad about youmad
You MUST understand
I can think only of you
I am insane with jealousy of you
I want youI must have you
He would have seized her in his arms but the look of sheer amazement she gave him protected her where no protest or struggle would
You
she said
Did you really mean it
I thought you were just talking
Cant you see that I mean it
Yesyou look as if you did
But I cant believe it
I could never think of you in that way
Once more that frank statement of indifference infuriated him
He MUST compel her to feelhe must give that indifference the lieand at once
He caught her in his arms
He rained kisses upon her pale face
She made not the least resistance but seemed dazed
I will teach you to love me he cried drunk now with the wine of her lips with the perfume of her exquisite youth
I will make you happy
We shall be mad with happiness
She gently freed herself
I dont believe I could ever think of you in that way
Yes darlingyou will
You cant help loving where you are loved so utterly
She gazed at him wonderinglythe puzzled wonder of a child
Youloveme
she said slowly
Call it what you like
I am mad about you
I have forgotten everythingpridepositionthings you cant imagineand I care for nothing but you
And again he was kissing her with the soft fury of fire and again she was submitting with the passive dazed expression that seemed to add to his passion
To make her feel
To make her respond
He whom so many women had lovedwomen of position of fame for beauty of social distinction or distinction as singers playerswomen of society and women of talent all kinds of worthwhile womenthey had cared had run after him had given freely all he had asked and more
And this girlnobody at allshe had nothing for him
He held her away from him cried angrily What is the matter with you
What is the matter with me
I dont understand she said
I wish you wouldnt kiss me so much
He released her laughed satirically
Ohyou are playing a game
I might have known
I dont understand said she
A while ago you said you loved me
Now you act as if you didnt like me at all
And she smiled gayly at him pouting her lips a little
Once more her beauty was shining
It made his nerves quiver to see the color in her pure white skin where he had kissed her
I dont care whether it is a game or not he cried
And he was about to seize her again when she repulsed him
He crushed her resistance held her tight in his arms
You frighten me she murmured
Youhurt me
He released her
What do you want
he cried
Dont you care at all
Oh yes
I like youvery much
I have from the first time I saw you
But you seem olderand more serious
Never mind about that
We are going to love each otherand I am going to make you and your father happy
If you make father happy I will do anything for you
I dont want anything myselfbut he is getting old and sometimes his despair is terrible
There were tears in her voicetears and the most touching tenderness
He has some great secret that he wants to discover and he is afraid he will die without having had the chance
You will love me if I make your father happy
He knew it was the question of a fool but he so longed to hear from her lips some word to give him hope that he could not help asking it
She said Love you asas you seem to love me
Not that same way
I dont feel that way toward you
But I will love you in my own way
He observed her with penetrating eyes
Was this speech of hers innocence or calculation
He could get no clue to the truth
He saw nothing but innocence the teaching of experience warned him to believe in nothing but guile
He hid his doubt and chagrin behind a mocking smile
As you please said he
I will do my part
Thenwell see



Do you care about anyone elsein MY way of loving I mean
It was again the question of an infatuated fool and put in an infatuated fools way
For if she were a deep one how could he hope to get the truth
But her answer reassured him
No she saidher simple direct negation that had a convincing power he had never seen equaled
If I ever knew of another mans touching you he said Id feel like strangling him
He laughed at himself
Not that I should strangle him
That sort of thing isnt done any more
But Id do something devilish
But I havent promised not to kiss anyone else she said
Why should I
I dont love you
He looked at her strangely
But youre going to love me he said
She shrank within herself again
She looked at him with uneasy eyes
You wont kiss me any more until I tell you that I do love you
she asked with the gravity and pathos and helplessness of a child
Dont you want to learn to love meto learn to love
She was silenta silence that maddened him
Dont be afraid to speak he said irritably
What are you thinking
That I dont want you to kiss meand that I do want father to be happy
Was this guile
Was it innocence
He put his arms round her
Look at me he said
She gazed at him frankly
You like me
Yes
Why dont you want me to kiss you
I dont know
It makes medislike you
He released her
She laid her hand on his arm eagerly
Please she implored
I dont mean to hurt you
I wouldnt offend you for anything
Only when you ask me a questionmustnt I tell you the truth
Always he said believing in her in spite of the warnings of cynical worldliness
I dont know whether you are sincere or notas yet
So for the present Ill give you the benefit of the doubt
He stood back and looked at her from head to foot
You are beautiful perfect he said in a low voice
He laughed
Ill resist the temptation to kiss you again
I must go now
About your fatherIll see what can be done
She stood with her hands behind her back looking up at him with an expression he could not fathom
Suddenly she advanced put up her lips and said gravely Wont you kiss me
He eyed her quizzically
Ohyouve changed your mind 
She shook her head
Then why do you ask me to kiss you 
Because of what you said about father
He laughed and kissed her
And then she too laughed
He said Not for my own sakenot a little bit
Oh yes she cried when you kiss me that way
I like to be kissed
I am very affectionate
He laughed again
You ARE a queer one
If its a game its a good one
Is it a game
I dont know said she gayly
Good night
This is dreadfully late for me
Good night he said and they shook hands
Do you like me betteror less
Better was her prompt apparently honest reply
Curiously enough Im beginning to LIKE you said he
Now dont ask me what I mean by that
If you dont know already youll not find out from me
Oh but I do know cried she
The way you kissed methat was one thing
The way you feel toward me nowthats a different thing
Isnt it so
Exactly
I see we are going to get on
Yes indeed
They shook hands again in friendliest fashion and she opened the front door for him
And her farewell smile was bright and happy
VII IN the cold clear open he proceeded to take the usual account of stockwith dismal results
She had wound him round her fingers had made him say only the things he should not have said and leave unsaid the things that might have furthered his purposes
He had conducted the affair ridiculouslyjust what is to be expected of an infatuated fool
However there was no consolation in the discovery that he was reduced after all these years of experience to the common level man weak and credulous in his dealings with woman
He hoped that his disgust with himself would lead on to disgust or rather distaste for her
It is the primal instinct of vanity to dislike and to shun those who have witnessed its humiliation
I believe I am coming to my senses he said
And he ventured to call her up before him for examination and criticism
This as he stood upon the forward deck of the ferry with the magnificent panorama of New York before him
New York
And he of its strong men of the few in all that multitude who had rank and powerhe who had won as his promised wife the daughter of one of the dozen mighty ones of the nation
What an illtimed what an absurd what a crazy step down this excursion of his
And for what
There he summoned her before him
And at the first glance of his fancy at her fair sweet face and lovely figure he quailed
He was hearing her voice again
He was feeling the yield of her smooth round form to his embrace the yield of her smooth white cheek to his caress
In his nostrils was the fragrance of her youth the matchless perfume of nature beyond any of the distillations of art in its appeal to his normal and healthy nerves
And he burned with the fire only she could quench
I must I mustMy God I MUST
he muttered
When he reached home he asked whether his sister was in
The butler said that Mrs Fitzhugh had just come from the theater
In search of her he went to the library found her seated there with a book and a cigarette her wrap thrown back upon her chair
Come out to supper with me Ursula he said
Im starved and bored
Why youre not dressed
exclaimed his sister
I thought you were at the Cameron dance with Josephine
Had to cut it out replied he curtly
Will you come
I cant eat but Ill drink
Yes lets have a spree
Its been years since we had onenot since we were poor
Lets not go to a DEADLY respectable place
Lets go where there are some of the other kind too
But I must have food
Why not the Martin
Thatll dothough Id prefer something a little farther up Broadway
The Martin is gay enough
The truth is theres nothing really gay any more
Theres too much money
Money suffocates gayety
To the Martin they went and he ordered an enormous supperone of those incredible meals for which he was famous
They dispatched a quart of champagne before the supper began to come he drinking at least two thirds of it
He drank as much while he was eating and called for a third bottle when the coffee was served
He had eaten half a dozen big oysters a whole guinea hen a whole portion of salad another of Boniface cheese with innumerable crackers
If I could eat as you do
sighed Ursula enviously
Yet its only one of your accomplishments
Im not eating much nowadays said he gloomily
Im losing my appetite
And he lit a long black cigar and swallowed half a large glass of the champagne
Nothing tastes goodnot even champagne
There IS something wrong with you said Ursula
Did you ask me out for confidences or for advice or for both
None of them replied he
Only for company
I knew Id not be able to sleep for hours and I wanted to put off the time when Id be alone
I wish I had as much influence with you as you have with me said Ursula by way of preparation for confidences
Influence
Dont I do whatever you say
She laughed
Nobody has influence over you she said
Not even myself replied he morosely
Wellthat talkingto you gave me has had its effect proceeded Mrs Fitzhugh
It set me to thinking
There are other things besides loveman and woman love
Ive decided toto behave myself and give poor Clayton a chance to rest
She smiled a little maliciously
Hes had a horrible fright
But its over now
What a fine thing it is for a woman to have a sensible brother
Norman grunted took another liberal draught of the champagne
If I had a mind like yours
pursued Ursula
Now you simply couldnt make a fool of yourself
He looked at her sharply
He felt as if she had somehow got wind of his eccentric doings
Ive always resented your rather contemptuous attitude toward women she went on
But you are rightreally you are
Were none of us worth the excitement men make about us
It isnt the woman who makes a fool of the man said Norman
Its the man who makes a fool of himself
A match can cause a terrific explosion if its in the right placebut not if it isnt
She nodded
Thats it
Were simply matches and most of us of the poor sputtering kind that burns with a bad odor and goes out right away
A very inferior quality of matches
Yes repeated Norman its the man who does the whole business
A mocking smile curled her lips
I knew you werent in love with Josephine
He stared gloomily at his cigar
But youre going to marry her
Im in love with her he said angrily
And Im going to marry her
She eyed him shrewdly
Fredare you in love with some one else
He did not answer immediately
When he did it was with a No that seemed the more emphatic for the delay
Oh just one of your little affairs
And she began to poke fun at him
I thought you had dropped that sort of thing for good and all
I hope Josie wont hear of it
Shed not understand
Women never dounless they dont care a rap about the man



Is she on the stage
I know youll not tell me but I like to ask
Her brother looked at her rather wildly
Lets go home he said
He was astounded and alarmed by the discovery that his infatuation had whirled him to the lunacy of longing to confideand he feared lest if he should stay on he would blurt out his disgraceful secret
Waiter the bill
Dont lets go yet urged his sister
The most interesting people are beginning to come
Besides I want more champagne
He yielded
While she gazed round with the air of a visitor to a Zoo that is affected by fashionable people and commented on the faces figures and clothes of the women he stared at his plate and smoked and drank
Finally she said Id give anything to see you make a fool of yourself just once
He grinned
Things are in the way to having your wish gratified he said
It looks to me as if my time had come
She tried to conceal her anxiety
Are you serious
she asked
Then added Of course not
You simply couldnt
Especially nowwhen Josephine might hear
I suppose youve noticed how Joe Culver is hanging round her
He nodded
Theres no dangerunless I shall marry Josephine
Not if she hears
Shes not going to hear
Dont be too sure
Women love to boast
It tickles their vanity to have a man
Yes they pretend to be madly in love simply to give themselves the excuse for tattling
Shell not hear
You cant be sure
I want you to help me out
Im going to tell her Im tremendously busy these few next daysor weeks
Weeks
Ursula Fitzhugh laughed
My it must be serious
Weeks repeated her brother
And I want you to say things thatll help outand to see a good deal of her
He flung down his cigar
You women dont understand how it is with a man
Dont we though
Why its a very ordinary occurrence for a woman to be really in love with several men at once
His eyes gleamed jealously
I dont believe it he cried
Not Josephine she said reassuringly
Shes one of those singlehearted untemperamental women
They concentrate
They have no imagination
I wasnt thinking of Josephine said he sullenly
To go back to what I was saying I am in love with Josephine and with no one else
I cant explain to you how or why Im entangled
But Ill get myself untangled all rightand very shortly
I know that Fred
You arent the permanent damnfool sort
I should say not
exclaimed he
Its a hopeful sign that I know exactly how big a fool I am
She shook her head in strong dissent
On the con trary said she its a bad sign
I didnt realize I was making a fool of myself until you pointed it out to me
That stopped me
If I had been doing it with my eyes open your jacking me up would only have made me go ahead
A womans different
It doesnt take much to stop a woman
Shes about half stopped when she begins
Ursula was thoroughly alarmed
Fred she said earnestly youre running bang into danger
The time to stop is right now
Cant do it he said
Lets not talk about it
Cant
That word from YOU
From me replied he
Dont forget helping out with Josephine
Lets go
And he refused to be persuaded to stay onor to be cajoled or baited into talking further of this secret his sister saw was weighing heavily
He was down town half an hour earlier than usual the next morning
But no one noted it because his habit had always been to arrive among the firstnot to set an example but to give his prodigious industry the fullest swing
There was in Turkey a great poet of whom it is said that he must have written twenty five hours a day
Normans accomplishment bulked in that same way before his associates
He had not slept the whole night
But thanks to his enormous vitality no trace of this serious dissipation showed
The huge supper he had eatenand drunkthe sleepless night and the giant breakfast of fruit and cereal and chops and wheat cakes and coffee he had laid in to stay him until lunch time would together have given pause to any but such a physical organization as his
The only evidence of it was a certain slight irritabilitybut this may have been due to his state of intense selfdissatisfaction
As he entered the main room his glance sought the corner where Miss Hallowell was ensconced
She happened to look up at that instant
With a radiant smile she bowed to him in friendliest fashion
He colored deeply frowned with annoyance bowed coldly and strode into his room
He fussed and fretted about with his papers for a few minutes then rang the bell
Send in Miss Pritchardno Mr Gowdyno Miss Hallowell he said to the office boy
And then he looked sharply at the pert young face for possible signs of secret cynical amusement
He saw none such but was not convinced
He knew too well how by a sort of occult process the servants all the subordinates round a person like himself discover the most intimate secrets almost get the news before anything has really occurred
Miss Hallowell appeared and very cold and reserved she looked as she stood waiting
I sent for you because he began
He glanced at the door to make sure that it was closed because I wanted to hear your voice
And he laughed boyishly
He was in high good humor now
Why did you speak to me as you did when you came in
said she
There was certainly novelty in this direct attack this equal to equal criticism of his manners
He was not pleased with the novelty but at the same time he felt a lack of the courage to answer her as she deserved even if she was playing a clever game
It isnt necessary that the whole office should know our private business said he
She seemed astonished
What private business
Last night said he uncertain whether she was trifling with him or was really the innocent she pretended to be
If I were you Id not speak as friendlily as you did this morningnot before people
Why
inquired she her sweet young face still more perplexed
This isnt a small town out West explained he
Its New York
People misunderstandor rather He gave her a laughing mischievous glanceor ratherthey dont
I cant see anything to make a mystery about declared the girl
Why you act as if there were something to be ashamed of in coming to see me
He was observing her sharply
How could a girl live in the New York atmosphere several years without getting a sensible point of view
Yet so far as he could judge this girl was perfectly honest in her ignorance
Dont be foolish said he
Please accept the fact as I give it to you
You mustnt let people see everything
She made no attempt to conceal her dislike for this
I wont be mixed up in anything like that said she quite gently and without a suggestion of pique or anger
It makes me feel lowand its horribly common
Either we are going to be friends or we arent
And if we are why were friends whenever we meet
Im not ashamed of you
And if you are ashamed of me you can cut me out altogether
His color deepened until his face was crimson
His eyes avoided hers
I was thinking chiefly of you he saidand he honestly thought he was speaking the whole truth
Then please dont do so any more said she turning to go
I understand about New York snobbishness
I want nothing to do with it
He disregarded the danger of the door being opened at any moment
He rushed to her and took her reluctant hand
You mustnt blame me for the ways of the world
I cant change them
Do be sensible dearest
Youre only going to be here a few days longer
Ive got that plan for you and your father all thought out
Ill put it through at once
I dont want the office talking scandal about usdo you
She looked at him pityingly
His eyes fell before hers
I know its a weakness he said giving up trying to deceive her and himself
But I cant help it
I was brought up that way
WellI wasnt
I see we can never be friends
What a mess he had made of this affair
This girl must be playing upon him
In his folly he had let her see how completely he was in her power and she was using that power to establish relations between them that were the very opposite of what he desiredand must have
He must control himself
As you please he said coldly dropping her hand
Im sorry but unless you are reasonable I can do nothing for you
And he went to his desk
She hesitated a moment as her back was toward him he could not see her expression
Without looking round she went out of his office
It took all his strength to let her go
Shes bluffing he muttered
And yetperhaps she isnt
There may be people like that left in New York
Whatever the truth he simply must make a stand
He knew women no woman had the least respect for a man who let her ruleand this woman relying upon his weakness for her was bent upon ruling
If he did not make a stand she was lost to him
If he did make a stand he could no more than lose her
Lose her
That thought made him sick at heart
What a fool I am about her
he cried
I must hurry things up
I must get enough of her must get through it and back to my sober senses
That was a time of heavy pressure of important affairs
He furiously attacked one task after another only to abandon each in turn
His mind which had always been his obedient very humble servant absolutely refused to obey
He turned everything over to his associates or to subordinates fighting all morning against the longing to send for her
At half past twelve he strode out of the office putting on the air of the big man absorbed in big affairs
He descended to the street
But instead of going up town to keep an appointment at a business lunch he hung round the entrance to the opposite building
She did not appear until one oclock
Then out she camewith the head office boythe goodlooking young head office boy
Normans contempt for himself there reached its lowest ebb
For his blood boiled with jealousy jealousy of his head office boyand about an obscure little typewriter
He followed the two keeping to the other side of the street
Doubtless those who saw and recognized him fancied him deep in thought about some mighty problem of corporate law or policy as he moved from and to some meeting with the great men who dictated to a nation of ninety millions what they should buy and how much they should pay for it
He saw the two enter a quicklunch restaurantstruggled with a crackbrained impulse to join themdragged himself away to his appointment
He was never too amiable in dealing with his clients because he had found that in selfprotection to avoid being misunderstood and largely increasing the difficulties of amicable intercourse he must keep the feel of iron very near the surface
That day he was for the first time irascible
If the business his clients were engaged in had been less perilous and his acute intelligence not indispensable he would have cost the firm dear
But in business circles where every consideration yields to that of material gain the man with the brain may conduct himself as he pleasesand usually does so when he has strength of character
All afternoon he wrestled with himself to keep away from the office
He won but it was the sort of victory that gives the winner the chagrin and despondency of defeat
At home late in the afternoon he found Josephine in the doorway just leaving
Youll walk home with mewont you
she said
And taken unawares and intimidated by guilt he could think of no excuse
Some oneprobably a Frenchmanhas said that there are always in a mans life three womenthe one on the way out the one that is and the one that is to be
Normanever the industrious trafficker with the feminine that the man of the intense vitality necessary to a great career of action is apt to bewas by no means new to the situation in which he now found himself
But never before had the circumstances been so difficult
Josephine in no way resembled any woman with whom he had been involved she was the first he had taken seriously
Nor did the other woman resemble the central figure in any of his affairs
He did not know what she was like how to classify her but he did know that she was unlike any woman he had ever known and that his feeling for her was different appallingly differentfrom any emotion any other woman had inspired in him
Soa walk alone with Josephine a first talk with her after his secret treachery was no light matter
Deeper and deeper he said to himself
Where is this going to end
She began by sympathizing with him for having so much to doand father says you can get through more work than any man he ever knew not excluding himself
She was full of tenderness and compliment of a kind of love that made him feel as the dirt beneath his feet
She respected him so highly she believed in him so entirely
The thought of her discovering the truth or any part of it gave him a sensation of nausea
He was watching her out of the corner of his eye
Never had he seen her more statelily beautiful
If he should lose her
Im madMAD
he said to himself
Josephine is as high above her as heaven above earth
What is there to her anyhow
Not brainsnor taste nor such miraculous beauty
Why do I make an ass of myself about her
I ought to go to my doctor
I dont believe youre listening to what Im saying laughed Josephine
My heads in a terrible state replied he
I cant think of anything
Dont try to talk or to listen dearest said she in the sweet and soothing tone that is neither sweet nor soothing to a man in a certain species of unresponsive mood
This air will do you good
It doesnt annoy you for me to talk to you does it
The question was one of those which confidently expects even demands a sincere and strenuous negative for answer
It fretted him this matterofcourse assumption of hers that she could not but be altogether pleasing not to say enchanting to him
Her position her wealth the attentions she had received the flatteries In her circumstances could it be in human nature not to think extremely well of oneself
And he admitted that she had the right so to think
Still For the first time she scraped upon his nerves
His reply Annoy me
The contrary was distinctly crisp
To an experienced ear there would have sounded the faint warning undernote of sullenness
But she believing in his love and in herself saw nothing suspected nothing
We know each other so thoroughly she went on that we dont need to make any effort
How congenial we are
I always understand you
I feel such a sense of the perfect freedom and perfect frankness between us
Dont you
You have wonderful intuitions said he
It was the time to alarm him by coldness by capr ciousness
But how could she know it
And she was in lovereally in lovenot with herself not with love but with him
Thus she made the mistake of all true lovers in those difficult moments
She let him see how absolutely she was his
Nor did the spectacle of her sincerity of her belief in his sincerity put him in any better humor with himself
The walk was a mere matter of a dozen blocks
He thought it would never end
You are sure you arent ill
she said when they were at her doora superb bronze door it was opening into a house of the splendor that for the acclimated New Yorker quite conceals and more than compensates absence of individual taste
You dont look ill
But you act queerly
Im often this way when they drive me too hard down town
She looked at him with fond admiration he might have been better pleased had there not been in the look a suggestion of the possessive
How they do need you
Father says But I mustnt make you any vainer than you are
He usually loved compliment could take it in its rawest form with fine human gusto
Now he did not care enough about that father says to rise to her obvious bait
Im horribly tired he said
Shall I see you tomorrow
No I guess notnot for several days
You understand
Perfectly replied she
Ill miss you dreadfully but my father has trained me well
I know I mustnt be selfishand tempt you to neglect things
Thank you said he
I must be off
Youll come injust a moment
Her eyes sparkled
The butler will have sense enough to go straight awayand the small reception room will be quite empty as usual
He could not escape
A few seconds and he was alone with her in the little roomhow often had he theybeen glad of its quiet and seclusion on such occasions
She laid her hand upon his shoulders gazed at him proudly
It was here said she that you first kissed me
Do you remember
To take her gaze from his face and to avoid seeing her look of loving trust he put his arms round her
I dont deserve you he saidone of those empty pretenses of confession that yet give the human soul a sense of truthfulness
Youd not say that if you knew how happy you make me murmured she
The welcome sound of a step in the hall give him his release
When he was in the street he wiped his hot face with his handkerchief
And I thought I had no moral sense left
he reflectednot the first man in this climax day of the triumph of selfish philosophies to be astonished by the discovery that the dead hands of heredity and tradition have a power that can successfully defy reason
He started to walk back home on impulse took a passing taxi and went to his club
It was the Federal
They said of it that no man who amounted to anything in New York could be elected a member because any man on his way up could not but offend one or more of the important persons in control
Most of its members were nominated at birth or in childhood and elected as soon as they were twentyone
Norman was elected after he became a man of consequence
He regarded it as one of the signal triumphs of his career and beyond question it was proof of his power of the eagerness of important men despite their jealousy to please him and to be in a position to get the benefit of his brains should need arise
Normans whole career like every career great and small in the arena of action was a derision of the ancient moralities a demonstration of the value of fear as an aid to success
Even his friendsand he had as many as he cared to havehad been drawn to him by the desire to placate him to stand well where there was danger in standing ill Until dinner time he stood at the club bar drinking one cocktail after another with that supreme indifference to consequences to health which made his fellow men gape and wonderand cost an occasional imitator health and perhaps life
Nor did the powerful liquor have the least effect upon him apparently
Possibly he was in a better humor but not noticeably so
He dined at the club and spent the evening at bridge winning several hundred dollars
He enjoyed the consideration he received at that club for his fellow members being men of both social and financial consequence their conspicuous respect for him was a concentrated essence of general adulation
He lingered on eating a great supper with real appetite
He went home in high good humor with himself
He felt that he was a conqueror born that such things of his desire as did not come could be forced to come
He no longer regarded his passion for the nebulous girl of many personalities as a descent from dignity
Was he not king
Did not his favor give her whatever rank he pleased
Might not a king pick and choose according to his fancy
Let the smaller fry grow nervous about these matters of caste
They did well to take care lest they should fall
But not he
He had won thus far by haughtiness never by cringing
His mortal day would be that in which he should abandon his natural tactics for the modes of lesser men
True only a strong head could remain steady in these giddy altitudes of self confidence
But was not his head strong
And without hesitation he called up the vision that made him deliriousand detained it and reveled in it until sleep came
VIII THE longer he thought of it the stronger grew his doubt that the little Hallowell girl could be so indifferent to him as she seemed
Not that she was a fraud that is a conscious fraudeven so much of a fraud as the sincerest of the other women he had known
Simply that she was carrying out a scheme of coquetry
Could it be in human nature even in the nature of the most indiscriminating of the specimens of young feminine ignorance and folly not to be flattered by the favor of such a man as he
Common sense answered that it could not bebut neglected to point out to him that almost any vagary might be expected of human nature when it could produce such a deviation from the recognized types as a man of his position agitated about such an unsought obscurity as Miss Hallowell
He continued to debate the state of her mind as if it were an affair of mightiest momentwhich indeed it was to him
And presently his doubt strengthened into conviction
She must be secretly pleased flattered responsive
She had been in the office long enough to be impressed by his position
Yes there must be more or less pretense in her apparently complete indifferencemore or less pretense more or less coquetry probably not a little timidity
She would come down from her high horsewith help and encouragement from him
He was impatient to get to the office and see just how she would do it what absurd amusing attractive childs trick she would think out imagining she could fool him as lesser intelligences are ever fatuously imagining they can outwit greater
He rather thought she would come in to see him on some pretext would maneuver round like a bird pretending to flutter away from the trap it has every intention of entering
But eleven oclock of a wasted morning came and she did not appear
He went out to see if she was thereshe must be sick she could not be there or he would have heard from her



Yes she was at her desk exactly as always
No not exactly the same
She was obviously attractive now the air of insignificance had gone and not the dullest eyes in that office could fail to see at least something of her beauty
And Tetlow was hanging over her while the girls and boys grinned and whispered
Clearly the office was on to Tetlow



Norman erect and coldly infuriate called out Mr Tetlowone moment please
He went back to his den Tetlow startling and following like one on the way to the bar for sentence
Mr Tetlow he said when they were shut in to gether you are making a fool of yourself before the whole office
Be a little patient with me Mr Norman said the head clerk humbly
Ive got another place for her
Shes going to take it tomorrow
Thentherell be no more trouble
Norman paled
She wishes to leave
he contrived to articulate
She spoke to me about leaving before I told her I had found her another job
Norman debatedbut for only a moment
I do not wish her to leave he said coldly
I find her useful and most trustworthy
Tetlows eyes were fixed strangely upon him
Whats the matter with you
asked Norman the undernote of danger but thinly covered
Then she was right said Tetlow slowly
I thought she was mistaken
I see that she is right
What do you mean
said Normana mere inquiry devoid of bluster or any other form of nervousness
You know very well what I mean Fred Norman said Tetlow
And you ought to be ashamed of yourself
Dont stand there scowling and grimacing like an idiot said Norman with an amused smile
What do you mean
She told meabout your coming to see her about your offer to do something for her fatherabout your acting in a way that made her uneasy
For an instant Norman was panicstricken
Then his estimate of her reassured him
I took your advice said he
I went to see for myself
How did I act that she was made uneasy
She didnt say
But a woman can tell what a man has in the back of his headwhen it concerns her
And she is a good womanso innocent that you ought to be ashamed of yourself for even thinking of her in that way
God has given innocence instincts and she felt what you were about
Norman laugheda deliberate provocation
Love has made a fool of you old man he said
I notice you dont deny retorted Tetlow shrewdly
Deny what
Theres nothing to deny
He felt secure now that he knew she had been reticent with Tetlow as to the happenings in the cottage
Maybe Im wronging you said Tetlow but not in the tone of belief
However that may be I know youll not refuse to listen to my appeal
I love her Norman
Im going to make her my wife if I can
And I ask youfor the sake of our old friendship to let her alone
Ive no doubt you could dazzle her
You couldnt make a bad woman of her
But you could make her very miserable
Norman pushed about the papers before him
His face wore a cynical smile but Tetlow who knew him in all his moods saw that he was deeply agitated
I dont know that I can win her Fred he pleaded
But I feel that I might if I had a fair chance
You think shed refuse YOU
said Norman
Like a flash unless Id made her care for me
Thats the kind she is
That sounds absurd
Why there isnt a woman in New York who would refuse a chance to take a high jump up
Id have said so too
But since Ive gotten acquainted with her Ive learned better
She may be spoiled some day but she hasnt been yet
God knows I wish I could tempt her
But I cant
Youre entirely too credulous old man
Shell make a fool of you
I know better Tetlow stubbornly maintained
Anyhow I dont care
I love her and Id marry her no matter what her reason for marrying me was
What pitiful infatuationworse than his own
Poor Tetlowhe deserved a better fate than to be drawn into this girls trapfor of course she never could care for such a heavy citizenheavy and homely the loosely fat kind of homely that is admired by no one not even by a woman with no eye at all for the physical points of the male
It would be a real kindness to save worthy Tetlow
What a fool shed make of himhow shed squander his moneyand torment him with jealousyand unfit him for his career
Poor Tetlow
If he could get what he wanted hed be well punished for his imprudence in wanting it
Really could friendship do him a greater service than to save him
Norman gave Tetlow a friendly humorous glance
Youre a hopeless case Billy he said
But at least dont rush into trouble
Take your time
You can always get in you know and you may not get in quite so deep
You promise to let her alone
said Tetlow eagerly
Again his distinguished friend laughed
Dont be an ass old man
Why imagine that just because youve taken a fancy to a girl everyone wants her
He clapped him on the shoulder gave him a push toward the door
Ive wasted enough time on this nonsense
Tetlow did not venture to disregard a hint so plain
He went with his doubt still unsolvedhis doubt whether his jealousy was right or his high opinion of his hero friend whose series of evermounting successes had filled him with adoration
He knew the way of success knew no man could tread it unless he had or acquired a certain hardness of heart that made him an uncomfortable not to say dangerous associate
He regretted his own inability to acquire that indispensable hardness and envied and admired it in Fred Norman
But at the same time that he admired he could not help distrusting
Norman battled with his insanity an hour then sent for Miss Hallowell
The girl had lost her look of strength and vitality
She seemed frail and dimso unimportant physically that he wondered why her charm for him persisted
Yet it did persist
If he could take her in his arms could make her drooping beauty revivethrough love for him if possible if not then through anger and hate
He must make her feel must make her acknowledge that he had power
It seemed to him another instance of the resistless fascination which the unattainable however unworthy has ever had for the conqueror temperament
You are leaving
he said curtly both a question and an affirmation
Yes
You are making a mistakea serious mistake
She stood before him listlessly as if she had no interest either in what he was saying or in him
That maddening indifference
It was a mistake to tattle your trouble to Tetlow
I did not tattle said she quietly colorlessly
I said only enough to make him help me
And what did he say about me
That I had misjudged youthat I must be mistaken
Norman laughed
How seriously the little people of the world do take themselves
She looked at him
His amused eyes met hers frankly
You didnt mean it
she said
He beamed on her
Certainly I did
But Im not a lunatic or a wild beast
Do you think I would take advantage of a girl in your position
Her eyes seemed to grow large and weary and an expression of experience stole over her young face giving it a strange appearance of ageinyouth
It has been done said she
How reconcile such a look with the theory of her childlike innocence
But then how reconcile any two of the many varied personalities he had seen in her
He said Yesit has been done
But not by me
I shall take from you only what you gladly give
You will get nothing else said she with quiet strength
That being settled he went on holding up a small package of papers bound together by an elastic Here are the proposed articles of incorporation of the Chemical Research Company
How do you like the name
What is it
The company that is to back your father
Capital stock twentyfive thousand dollars one half paid up
Your father to be employed as director of the laboratories at five thousand a year with a fund of ten thousand to draw upon
You to be employed as secretary and treasurer at fifteen hundred a year
I will take the paidup stock and your father and you will have the privilege of buying it back at par within five years
Do you follow me
I think I understand was her unexpected reply
Her replies were usually unexpected like the expressions of her face and figure she was continually comprehending where one would have said she would not and not comprehending where it seemed absurd that she should not
Yes I understand



What else
Nothing else
She looked intently at him and her eyes seemed to be reading his soul to the bottom
Nothing else he repeated
No obligationfor moneyorfor anything
No obligation
A hope perhaps
He was smiling with the gayest good humor
But not the kind of hope that ever becomes a disagreeable demand for payment
She seated herself her hands in her lap her eyes downa lovely picture of pensive repose
He waited patiently feasting his senses upon her delicate aromatic loveliness
At last she said I accept
He had anticipated an argument
This promptness took him by surprise
He felt called upon to explain to excuse her acceptance
I am taking a little flyer making a gamble said he
Your father may turn up nothing of commercial value
Again the company may pay big She gave him a long look through halfclosed eyes a queer smile flitting round her lips
I understand perfectly why you are doing it she said
Do you understand why I am accepting
Why should you refuse
rejoined he
It is a good business prop You know very well why I should refuse
But She gave a quiet laugh of experience it made him feel that she was making a fool of himI shall not refuse
I am able to take care of myself
And I want father to have his chance
Of course I shant explain to him
She gave him a mischievous glance
And I dont think YOU will
He contrived to cover his anger doubt chagrin general feeling of having been outwitted
No I shant tell him laughed he
You are making a great fool of me
Do you want to back out
What audacity
He hesitateddid not dare
Her indifference to himher personal her physical indifference gave her the mastery
His teeth clenched and his passion blazed in his eyes as he said Noyou witch
Ill see it through
She smiled lightly
I suppose youll come to the offices of the companyoccasionally
She drew nearer stood at the corner of the desk
Into her exquisite eyes came a look of tenderness
And I shall be glad to see you
You mean that
he said despising himself for his humble eagerness and hating her even as he loved her
Indeed I do
She smiled bewitchingly
You are a lot better man than you think
I am an awful fool about you retorted he
You see I play my game with all my cards on the table
I wish I could say the same of you
I am not playing a game replied she
You make a mystery where there isnt any
Andall your cards arent on the table
She laughed mockingly
At least you think theres one that isntthough really it is
Yes
About your engagement
He covered superbly
Oh said he in the most indifferent tone
Tetlow told you
As soon as I heard that she went on I felt better about you
I understand how it is with men the passing fancies they have for women
How did you learn
demanded he
Do you think a girl could spend several years knocking about down town in New York without getting experience
He smileda forced smile of raillery hiding sud den fierce suspicion and jealousy
I should say not
But you always pretend innocence
I cant be held responsible for what you read into my looks and into what I say observed she with her air of a wise old infant
But I was so glad to find out that you were seriously in love with a nice girl up town
He burst out laughing
She gazed at him in childlike surprise
Why are you laughing at me
she asked
Nothingnothing he assured her
He would have found it difficult to explain why he was so intensely amused at hearing the grand Josephine Burroughs called a nice girl up town
You are in love with her
You are engaged to her
she inquired her grave eyes upon him with an irresistible appeal for truth in them
Tetlow didnt lie to you evaded he
You dont know it but Tetlow is going to ask you to marry him
Yes I knew replied she indifferently
How
Did he tell you
No
Just as I knew you were not going to ask me to marry you
The mere phrase even when stated as a negation gave him a sensation of ice suddenly laid against the heart
Its quite easy to tell the difference between the two kinds of menthose that care for me more than they care for themselves and those that care for themselves more than they care for me
Thats the way it looks to youis it
Thats the way it is said she
There are some things you dont understand
This is one of them
Maybe I dont said she
But Ive my own ideaand Im going to stick to it
This amused him
You are a very opinionated and selfconfident young lady said he
She laughed roguishly
Im taking up a lot of your time
Dont think of it
You havent asked when the new deal is to begin
Oh yesand I shall have to tell Mr Tetlow Im not taking the place he got for me
Be careful what you say to him cautioned Norman
You must see it wouldnt be well to tell him what you are going to do
Theres no reason on earth why he should know your businessis there
She did not reply she was reflecting
You are not thinking of marrying Tetloware you
No she said
I dont love himand couldnt learn to
With a sincerely judicial air now that he felt secure he said Why not
It would be a good match
I dont love him she repeated as if that were a sufficient and complete answer
And he was astonished to find that he so regarded it also in spite of every assault of all that his training had taught him to regard as common sense about human nature
You can simply say to Tetlow that youve decided to stay at home and take care of your father
The offices of the company will be at your house
Your official duties practically amount to taking care of your father
So youll be speaking the truth
Oh it isnt exactly lying to keep something from somebody who has no right to know it
What you suggest isnt quite the truth
But its near enough and Ill say it to him
His own view of lying was the same as that she had expressed
Also he had no squeamishness about saying what was in no sense true if the falsehood were necessary to his purposes
Yet her statement of her code moral though he thought it and eminently sensible as well lowered her once more in his estimation
He was eager to find reason or plausible excuse for believing her morally other and less than she seemed to be
Immediately the prospects of his ultimate projects whatever they might prove to betook on a more hopeful air
And Id advise you to have Tetlow keep away from you
We dont want him nosing round
No indeed said she
He is a nice man but tiresome
And if I encouraged him ever so little hed be sentimental
The most tiresome thing in the world to a girl is a man who talks that sort of thing when she doesnt want to hear itfrom him
He laughed
Meaning me
he suggested
She nodded much pleased
Perhaps she replied
Dont worry about that mocked he
I shant till I have to she assured him
And I dont think Ill have to
On the Monday morning following Tetlow came in to see Norman as soon as he arrived
I want a two weeks leave he said
Im going to Bermuda or down there somewhere
Why whats the matter
cried Norman
You do look ill old man
I saw her last night replied the chief clerk dropping an effort at concealing his dejection
She she turned me down
Really
You
Normans tone of sympathetic surprise would not have deceived half attentive ears
But Tetlow was securely absorbed
Why Billy she cant hope to make as good a match
Thats what I told herwhen I saw the game was going against me
But it was no use
Norman trifled nervously with the papers before him
Presently he said Is it some one else
Tetlow shook his head
How do you know
Because she said so replied the head clerk
Ohif she said so that settles it said Norman with raillery
Shes given up workthank God pursued Tetlow
Shes getting more beautiful all the time Norman if you had seen her last night youd understand why Im stark mad about her
Normans eyes were down
His hands the muscles of his jaw were clinched
But I mustnt think of that Tetlow went on
As I was about to say if she were to stay on in the offices some onesome attractive man like you only with the heart of a scoundrel Norman laughed cynically
Yes a scoundrel
reiterated the fat headclerk
Some scoundrel would tempt her beyond her power to resist
Money and clothes and luxury will do anything
We all get to be harlots here in New York
Some of us know it and some dont
But we all look it and act it
And shed go the way of the restwith or without marriage
Its just as well she didnt marry me
I know whatd have become of her
Norman nodded
Tetlow gave a weary sigh
Anyhow shes safe at home with her father
Hes found a backer for his experiments
Thats good said Norman
You can spare me for ten days Tetlow went on
Id be of no use if I stayed
There was a depth of misery in his kind gray eyes that moved Norman to get up and lay a friendly hand on his shoulder
Its the best thing old man
She wasnt for you
Tetlow dropped into a chair and sobbed
It has killed me he groaned
I dont mean Ill commit suicide or die
I mean Im dead insidedead
Oh come Billywheres your good sense
I know what Im talking about said he
Norman God help the man who meets the woman he really wantsGod help him if she doesnt want him
You dont understand
Youll never have the experience
Any woman you wanted would be sure to want you
Norman his hand still on Tetlows shoulder was staring ahead with a terrible expression upon his strong features
If she could see the inside of methe part thats the real meI think she would love meor learn to love me
But she can only see the outsidethis homely face and body of mine
Its horrible Fredto have a mind and a heart fit for love and for being loved and an outside that repels it
And how many of us poor devils of that sort there aremen and women both
Norman was at the window now his back to the room to his friend
After a while Tetlow rose and made a feeble effort to straighten himself
Is it all right about the vacation
he asked
Certainly said Norman without turning
Thank you Fred
Youre a good friend
Ill see you before you go said Norman still facing the window
Youll come back all right
Tetlow did not answer
When Norman turned he was alone
IX IN no way was Normans luck superior to most mens more splendidly than in that his inborn tendency to arrogant and extravagant desires was matched by an inborn capacity to get the necessary money
His luxurious tastes were certainly not moderated by his associationsenormously rich people who while they could be stingy enough in some respects at the same time could and did fling away fortunes in gratifying selfish whimsfor silly showy houses for retinues of wasteful servants for gewgaws that accentuated the homeliness of their homely women and coarsened and vulgarized their pretty womenor perhaps for a nights gambling or entertaining or for the forced smiles and contemptuous caresses of some belle of the other world
Norman fortunately cared not at all for the hugely expensive pomp of the life of the rich if he had he would have hopelessly involved himself as after all he was not a moneygrubber but a lawyer
But when there appeared anything for which he did care he was ready to bid for it like the richest of the rich
Therefore the investment of a few thousand dollars seemed a small matter to him
He had many a time tossed away far more for far less
He did not dole out the sum he had agreed to provide
He paid it into the Jersey City bank to the credit of the Chemical Research Company and informed its secretary and treasurer that she could draw freely against it
If you will read the bylaws of the company said he you will see that youve the right to spend exactly as you see fit
When the money runs low let me know
Ill be very careful said Dorothea Hallowell secretary and treasurer
Thats precisely what we dont want replied he
He glanced round the tiny parlor of the cottage
We want everything to be run in firstclass shape
Thats the only way to get results
First of all you must take a proper housea goodsized one with large groundsroom for building your father a proper laboratory
Her dazed and dazzled expression delighted him
And you must live better
You must keep at least two servants
But we cant afford it
Your father has five thousand a year
You have fifteen hundred
That makes sixtyfive hundred
The rent of the house and the wages and keep of the servants are a charge against the corporation
So you can well afford to make yourselves comfortable
I havent got used to the idea as yet said Dorothea
Yeswe ARE better off than we were
And you must live better
I want you to get some clothesand things of that sort
She shrank within herself and sat quiet her gaze fixed upon her hands lying limp in her lap
There is no reason why your father shouldnt be made absolutely comfortable and happy
Thats the way to get the best results from a man of his sort
She faded on toward the selfeffacing blank he had first known
Think it out Dorothy he said in his frankest kindliest way
Youll see Im right
No she said
No
What does that mean
Ive an instinct against it replied she
Id rather father and I kept on as we are
But thats impossible
Youve no right to live in this small cramping way
You must broaden out and give HIM room to grow



Isnt that sensible 
It sounds so she admitted
But She gazed round helplesslyIm afraid
Afraid of what
I dont know
Then dont bother about it
Ill have to be verycareful she said thoughtfully
As you please replied he
Only dont live and think on a tendollaraweek basis
That isnt the way to get on
He never again brought up the matter in direct form
But most of his conversation was indirect and more or less subtle suggestions as to ways of branching out
She moved cautiously for a few days then timidly began to spend money
There is a notion widely spread abroad that people who have little money know more about the art of spending money and the science of economizing than those who have much
It would be about as sensible to say that the best swimmers are those who have never been near the water or no nearer than a bath tub
Anyone wishing to be convinced need only make an excursion into the poor tenement district and observe the garbage barrels overflowing with spoiled foodor the trashy goods exposed for sale in the shops and the markets
Those who have had money and have lost it are probably as a rule the wisest in thrift
Those who have never had money are almost invariably prodigal because they are ignorant
When Dorothea Hallowell was a baby the family had had money
But never since she could remember had they been anything but poor
She did not know how to spend money
She did not know prices or valuesbeing in that respect precisely like the mass of mankindand womankindwho imagine they are economical because they hunt socalled bargains and haggle with merchants who have got doubly ready for them by laying in inferior goods and by putting up prices in advance
She knew how much ten dollars a week was the meaning of the twenty to thirty dollars a week her father had made
But she had only a faintand exaggeratedly mistakennotion about sixtyfive hundred a yearsix and a half thousands
It seemed wealth to her so vast that a hundred thousand a year would have seemed no more
As soon as she drifted away from the known coursethe thirty to forty dollars a week upon which they had been living Dorothea Hallowell was in a trackless sea with a broken compass and no chart whatever
A common enough experience in America the land of sudden changes of fortune of rosiest hopes about striking it rich of carelessness and ignorance as to values of eager and untrained appetite for luxury and novelty of any and every kind
At first any expenditure however small for the plainest comfort which had been beyond their means seemed a giddy extravagance
But a bank accountAND a check booksoon dissipated that nervousness
A few charge accounts a little practice in the simple easy gesture of drawing a check and she was almost at her ease
With people who have known only squalor or with those who have earned their better fortune by privation and slow accumulation the spreading out process is usually slownot so slow as it used to be when our merchants had not learned the art of tempting any and every kind of human nature but still far from rapid
A piece of money reminds them vividly and painfully of the toil put into acquiring it and they shy away from the pitfall of the facile check
With those born and bred as Dorothy was and elevated into what seems to them affluence by no effort of their own the spreading is a tropical overnight affair
Counting all she spent and arranged to spend in those first few weeks you had no great total
But it was great for a girl who had been making ten dollars a week
Also there were sown in her mind broadcast and thick the seeds of desire for more luxurious comfort of need for it that could never be uprooted
Norman came over almost every evening
He got a new and youthful and youthrestoring kind of pleasure out of this process of expansion
He liked to hear each trifling detail and he was always making suggestions that bore immediate fruit in further expenditure
When he again brought up the subject of a larger house she listened with only the faintest protests
Her ideas of such a short time before seemed small laughably small now
Father was worrying only this morning because he is so cramped she admitted
We must remedy that at once said Norman
And on the following Sunday he and she went house hunting
They found a satisfactory placepeculiarly satisfactory to Norman because it was near the Hudson tunnel and so only a few minutes from his office
To Dorothy it loomed a mansion almost a palace
In fact it was a modestly roomy oldfashioned brick house with a brick stable at the side that with a little changing would make an admirable laboratory
You havent the timeor the experienceto fit this place up said Norman
Ill attend to itthat is Ill have it attended to
Seeing her uneasy expression he added I can get much better terms
Theyd certainly overcharge you
Theres no sense in wasting moneyis there
No she admitted convinced
He gave the order to a firm of decorators
It was a moderate order considering the amount of work that had to be done
But if the girl had seen the estimates Norman indorsed she would have been terrified
However he saw to it that she did not see them and she ignorant of values believed him when he told her the general account of the corporation must be charged with two thousand dollars
Her alarm took him by surprise
The sum seemed small to himand it was only about one fifth what the alterations and improvements had cost
Cried she Why thats more than our whole income for a year has been
You are forgetting these improvements add to the value of the property
Ive bought it
That quieted her
You are sure you didnt pay those decorators and furnishers too much
said she
You dont like their work
inquired he chagrined
Oh yesyes indeed she assured him
I like plain solidlooking things
Buttwo thousand dollars is a lot of money
Norman regretted that as his whole object had been to please her he had not ordered the more showy cheaper stuff but had insisted upon the simplest plainest looking appointments throughout
Even her bedroom furniture even her dressing table set was of the kind that suggests cost only to the experienced carefully and well educated in values and in taste
But Im sure it isnt fair to charge ALL these things to the company she protested
I cant allow it
Not the things for my personal use
You ARE a fierce watchdog of a treasurer said Norman laughing at her but noting and respecting the fine instinct of good breeding shown in her absence of greediness of desire to get all she could
But Im letting the firm of decorators take over what you leave behind in the old house
Ill see what theyll allow for it
Maybe that will cover the expense you object to
This contented her
Nor was she in the least suspicious when he announced that the decorators had made such a liberal allowance that the deficit was but three hundred dollars
Those chaps he explained have a wide margin of profit
Besides theyre eager to get more and bigger work from me
A few weeks and he was enjoying the sight of her ensconced with her father in luxurious comfortwith two servants with a wellrun house with pleasant gardens with all that is at the command of an income of six thousand a year in a comparatively inexpensive city
Only occasionallyand then not deeplywas he troubled by the reflection that he was still far from his goal and had made apparently absurdly little progress toward it through all this maneuvering
The truth was he preferred to linger when lingering gave him so many new kinds of pleasure
Of those in the large and motley company that sit down to the banquet of the senses the most are crude if not coarse gluttons
They eat fast and furiously having a raw appetite
Now and then there is one who has some idea of the art of enjoymentthe art of prolonging and varying both the joys of anticipation and the joys of realization
He turned his attention to tempting her to extravagance in dress
Rut his success there was not all he could have wished
She wore better clothesmuch better
She no longer looked the poor working girl struggling desperately to be neat and clean
She had almost immediately taken on the air of the comfortable classes
Rut everything she got for herself was inexpensive
and she made dresses for herself and trimmed all her hats
With the hats Norman found no fault
There her good taste produced about as satisfactory results as could have been got at the fashionable millinersmore satisfactory than are got by the women who go there with no taste of their own beyond a hazy idea that they want something like what Mrs SoandSo is wearing
But homemade dresses were a different matter
Norman longed to have her in toilettes that would bring out the full beauty of her marvelous figure
He after the manner of the more intelligent and worldly wise New York men had some knowledge of womens clothes
His sister knew how to dress Josephine knew how though her taste was somewhat too sober to suit Normanat least to suit him in Dorothy
He thought out and suggested dresses to Dorothy and told her where to get them
Dorothy tried to carry out at home such of his suggestions as pleased herfor like all women she believed she knew how to dress herself
Her handiwork was creditable
It would have contented a less exacting and less trained taste than Normans
It would have contented him had he not been infatuated with her beauty of face and form
As it was the improvement in her appearance only served to intensify his agitation
He now saw in her not only all that had first conquered him but also those unsuspected beauties and gracesand possibilities of beauty and grace yet more entrancing were she but dressed properly
You dont begin to appreciate how beautiful you are said he
It had ever been one of his rules in dealing with women to feed their physical vanity sparingly and cautiously lest it should blaze up into one of those consuming flames that produce a very frenzy of conceit
But this rule like all the others had gone by the board
He could not conceal his infatuation from her not even when he saw that it was turning her head and making his task harder and harder
If you would only go over to New York to several dressmakers whose names Ill give you I know youd get clothes from them that you could touch up into something uncommon
I cant afford it said she
What I have is good enoughand costs more than Ive the right to pay
And her tone silenced him it was the tone of finality and he had discovered that she had a will
Never before had Frederick Norman let any important thing drift
And when he started in with Dorothy he had no idea of changing that fixed policy
He would have scoffed if anyone had foretold to him that he would permit the days and the weeks to go by with nothing definite accomplished toward any definite purpose
Yet that was what occurred
Every time he came he had in mind a fixed resolve to make distinct progress with the girl
Every time he left he had a furious quarrel with himself for his weakness
She is making a fool of me he said to himself
She MUST be laughing at me
But he returned only to repeat his folly to add one more to the lengthening mocking series of lost opportunities
The truth lay deeper than he saw
He recognized only his own weakness of the infatuated lovers fatuous timidity
He did not realize how potent her charm for him was how completely content she made him when he was with her just from the fact that they were together
After a time an unsatisfied passion often thus diffuses itself ceases to be a narrow torrent becomes a broad river whose resistless force is hidden beneath an appearance of sparkling calm
Her ingenuousness amused him her developing taste and imagination interested him her freshness her freedom from any sense of his importance in the world fascinated him and there was a keener pleasure than he dreamed in the novel sensation of breathing the perfume of what he the one time cynic would have staked his life on being unsullied purity
Their relations were to him a delightful variation upon the intimacy of master and pupil
Either he was listening to her or was answering her questions and the time flew
And there never was a moment when he could have introduced the subject that most concerned him when he was not with her
To have introduced it would have been rudely to break the charm of a happy afternoon or evening
Was she leading him on and on nowhere deliberately
Or was it the sweet and innocent simplicity it seemed
He could not tell
He would have broken the charm and put the matter to the test had he not been afraid of the consequences
What had he to fear
Was she not in his power
Was she not his whenever he should stretch forth his hand and claim her
Yesno doubt not the slightest doubt
But He was afraid to break the charm it was such a satisfying charm
Thenthere was her father
Men who arrive anywhere in any direction always have the habit of ignoring the nonessential more or less strongly developed
One reasonperhaps the chief reasonwhy Norman had got up to the high places of material success at so early an age was that he had an unerring instinct for the essential and wasted no time or energy upon the nonessential
In his present situation Dorothys father the abstracted man of science was one of the factors that obviously fell into the nonessential class
Norman knew little about him and cared less
Also he took care to avoid knowing him
Knowing the father would open up possibilities of discomfort But being a wise young man Norman gave this matter the least possible thought
Still it was necessary that the two men see something of each other
Hallowell discovered nothing about Norman not enough about his personal appearance to have recognized him in the street far enough away from the laboratory to dissociate the two ideas
Human beingsexcept his daughterdid not interest Hallowell and his feeling for her was somewhat in the nature of an abstraction
Norman on the other hand was intensely interested in human beings indeed he was interested in little else
He was always thrusting through surfaces probing into minds and souls
He sought thoroughly to understand the living machines he used in furthering his ambitions and desires
So it was not long before he learned much about old Newton Hallowelland began to admire himand with a man of Normans temperament to admire is to like
He had assumed at the outset that the scientist was more or less the crank
He had not talked with him many times before he discovered that far from being in any respect a crank he was a most able and well balanced mentalitya genius
The day came when Dorothy not having returned from a shopping tour he lingered in the laboratory talking with the father or rather listening while the man of great ideas unfolded to him conceptions of the world that set his imagination to soaring
Most of us see but dimly beyond the ends of our noses and visualize what lies within our range of sight most imperfectly
We know little about ourselves less about others
We fancy that the world and the human race always have been about as they now are and always will be
History reads to us like a fairy tale to which we give conventional acceptance as truth
As to the future we can conceive nothing but the continuation of just what we see about us in the present
Norman practical man though he was living in and for the present had yet an imagination
He thought Hallowell a kind of fool for thinking only of the future and working only for itbut he soon came to think him n divine fool
And through Hallowells spectacles he was charmed for many an hour with visions of the world that is to be when in the slow but steady processes of evolution the human race will become intelligent will conquer the universe with the weapons of science and will make it over
When he first stated his projects to Norman the young man had difficulty in restraining his amusement
A new idea in any line of thought with which we are not familiar always strikes us as ridiculous
Norman had been educated in the ignorant conventional way still in high repute among the vulgar and among those whose chief delight is to make the vulgar gape in awe
He therefore had no science that is no knowledgeoutside his professionbut only what is called learning though tommyrot would be a fitter name for it
He had only the most meager acquaintance with that great fundamental of a sound and sane education embryology
He knew nothing of what science had already done to destroy all the still current notions about the mystery of life and birth
He still laughed as at a clever bit of legerdemain when Hallowell showed him how far science had progressed toward mastery of the life of the lower forms of existencehow those worms could be artificially created could be aged made young again made diseased and decrepit restored to perfect health could be swung back and forth or sideways or sinuously along the span of existencecould even be killed and brought back to vigor
Weve been at this sort of thing only a few years said Hallowell
I rather think it will not be many years now before we shall not even need the initial germ of life to enable us to create but can do it by pure chemical means just as a taper is lighted by holding a match to it
Norman ceased to think of sleightofhand
Life continued the juggler transformed now into practical man leader of men life has been demonstrated to be simply one of the forms of energy or one of the consequences of energy
The final discovery is scientifically not far away
Then His eyes lighted up
Then what
asked Norman
Then immortalityin the body
Eternal youth and health
A body that is renewable much as any of our inanimate machines of the factory is renewable
Why not
So far as we know no living thing ever dies except by violence
Diseaseold agethey are quite as much violence as the knife and the bullet
What science can now do with these worms as my daughter calls themthat it will be able to do with the higher organisms
And the world would soon be jammed to the last acre objected Norman
Hallowell shrugged his shoulders
Not at all
There will be no necessity to create new people except to take the place of those who may be accidentally obliterated
But the world is dyingthe earth itself I mean
True
But science may learn how to arrest that cooling processor to adapt man to it
Or it may be that when the world ceases to be inhabitable we shall have learned how to cross the star spaces as I think Ive suggested before
Thenwe should simply find a planet in its youth somewhere and migrate to it as a man now moves to a new house when the old ceases to please him
That is a long flight of the fancy said Norman
Longbut no stronger than the telegraph or the telephone
The trouble with us is that we have been long stupefied by the ignorant theological ideas of the universeideas that have come down to us from the childhood of the race
We havent got used to the new erathe scientific era
And that is natural
Why until less than three generations ago there was really no such thing as science
I hadnt thought of that admitted Norman
We certainly have got on very fast in those three generations
Rather fast
Not so fast however as we shall in the next three
Sciencechemistryis going speedily to change all the conditions of life because it will turn topsyturvy all the ways of producing thingsfood clothing shelter
Less than two generations ago men lived much as they had for thousands of years
But its very different today
It will be inconceivably different tomorrow
Norman could not get these ideas out of his brain
He began to understand why Hallowell cared nothing about the active life of the dayabout its religion politics modes of labor its habits of one creature preying upon another
Tomorrow not religion not politics but chemistry not priests nor politicians but chemists would change all thatand change it by the only methods that compel
An abstract idea of liberty or justice can be rejected evaded nullified
But a telephone a steam engine a mode of prolonging lifethose realizations of ideas COMPEL
When Dorothy came Norman went into the garden with her in a frame of mind so different from any he had ever before experienced that he scarcely recognized himself
As the influence of the fathers glowing imagination of genius waned before the daughters physical loveliness and enchantment for him he said to himself Ill keep away from him
Why
He did not permit himself to go on to examine into his reasons
But he could not conceal them from himself quickly enough to hide the knowledge that they were moral
What is the matter with you today
said Dorothy
You are not a bit interesting
Interested you mean he said with a smile of raillery for he had long since discovered that she was not without the feminine vanity that commands the centering of all interest in the woman herself and resents any wandering of thought as a slur upon her own powers of fascination
Well interested then said she
You are thinking about something else
Not now he assured her
But he left early
No sooner had he got away from the house than the scientific dreaming vanished and he wished himself back with her againback where every glance at her gave him the most exquisite sensations
And when he came the following day he apparently had once more restored her father to his proper place of a nonessential
All that definitely remained of the day befores impression was a certain satisfaction that he was aiding with his money an enterprise of greater value and of less questionable character than merely his own project
But the powerful influences upon our life and conduct are rarely direct and definite
He quite unconsciously had a wholly different feeling about Dorothy because of her father because of what his new knowledge of and respect for her father had revealed and would continue to reveal to him as to the girl herselfher training her inheritance her character that could not but be touched with the splendor of the fathers noble genius
And long afterward when the father as a distinct personality had been almost forgotten Nor man was still altogether unconsciously influenced by himpowerfully perhaps decisively influenced
Norman had no notion of it but ever after that talk in the laboratory Dorothy Hallowell was to him Newton Hallowells daughter
When he came the following day with his original purposes and plans once more intact as he thought he found that she had made more of a toilet than usual had devised a new way of doing her hair that enabled him to hang a highly prized addition in his memory gallery of widely varied portraits of her
The afternoon was warm
They sat under a big old tree at the end of the garden
He saw that she was much disturbedand that it had to do with him
From time to time she looked at him studying his face when she thought herself unobserved
As he had learned that it is never wise to open up the disagreeable he waited
After making several futile efforts at conversation she abruptly said I saw Mr Tetlow this morningin Twentythird Street
I was coming out of a chemical supplies store where father had sent me
She paused
But Norman did not help her
He continued to wait
HeMr Tetlowacted very strangely she went on
I spoke to him
He stared at me as if he werent going to speakas if I werent fit to speak to
Oh
said Norman
Then he came hurrying after me
And he said Do you know that Norman is to be married in two weeks
 So
said Norman
And I said What of it
How does that interest me
 It didnt interest you
I was surprised that you hadnt spoken of it replied she
But I was more interested in Mr Tetlows manner
What do you think he said next
I cant imagine said Norman
Whythat I was even more shameless than he thought
He said Oh I know all about you
I found out by accident
I shant tell anyone for I cant help loving you still
But it has killed my belief in woman to find out that YOU would sell yourself
 She was looking at Norman with eyes large and grave
And what did you say
he inquired
I didnt say anything
I looked at him as if he werent there and started on
Then he said When Norman abandons you as he soon will you can count on me if you need a friend
 There was a pause
Then Norman said And that was all
Yes replied she
Another pause
Norman said musingly Poor Tetlow
Ive not seen him since he went away to Bermudaat least he said he was going there
One day he sent the firm a formal letter of resignation



Poor Tetlow
Do you regret not having married him
I couldnt marry a man I didnt love
She looked at him with sweet friendly eyes
I couldnt even marry you much as I like you
Norman laugheda dismal attempt at ease and raillery
When he told me about your marrying she went on I knew how I felt about you
For I was not a bit jealous
Why havent you ever said anything about it
He disregarded this
He leaned forward and with curious deliberateness took her hand
She let it lie gently in his
He put his arm round her and drew her close to him
She did not resist
He kissed her upturned face kissed her upon the lips
She remained passive looking at him with calm eyes
Kiss me he said
She kissed himwithout hesitation and without warmth
Why do you look at me so
he demanded
I cant understand
Understand what
Why you should wish to kiss me when you love another woman
What would she say if she knew
Im sure I dont know
And I rather think I dont care
You are the only person on earth that interests me
Then why are you marrying
Lets not talk about that
Lets talk about ourselves
He clasped her passionately kissed her at first with selfrestraint then in a kind of frenzy
How can you be so cruel
he cried
Are you utterly cold
I do not love you she said
Why not
Theres no reason
Ijust dont
Ive sometimes thought perhaps it was because you dont love me
Good God Dorothy
What do you want me to say or do
Nothing replied she calmly
You asked me why I didnt love you and I was trying to explain
I dont want anything more than Im getting
I am contentarent you
Content
He laughed sardonically
As well ask Tantalus if he is content with the water always before his eyes and always out of reach
I want you all you have to give
I couldnt be content with less
You ought not to talk to me this way she reproved gently when you are engaged
He flung her hand into her lap
You are making a fool of me
And I dont wonder
Ive invited it
Surely never since man was created has there been such another ass as I
He drew her to her feet seized her roughly by the shoulders
When are you coming to your senses
he demanded
What do you mean
she inquired in her child like puzzled way
He shook her kissed her violently held her at arms length
Do you think it wise to trifle with me
he asked
Dont your good sense tell you theres a limit even to such folly as mine
What IS the matter
she asked pathetically
What do you want
I cant give you what I havent got to give
No he cried
But I want what you HAVE got to give
She shook her head slowly
Really I havent Mr
Norman
He eyed her with cynical amused suspicion
Why did you call me MR Norman just then
Usually you dont call me at all
Its been weeks since you have called me Mister
Was your doing it just then one of those subtle adroit timely tricks of yours
She was the picture of puzzled innocence
I dont understand she said
Wellperhaps you dont said he doubtfully
At any rate dont call me Mr Norman
Call me Fred
I cant
It isnt natural
You seem Mister to me
I always think of you as Mr
Norman
Thats it
And it must stop
She smiled with innocent gayety
Very well Fred



Fred



Now that Ive said it I dont find it strange
She looked at him with an expression between appeal and mockery
If youd only let me get acquainted with you
But you dont
You make me feel that Ive got to be careful with youthat I must be on my guard
I dont know against whatfor you are certainly the very best friend that Ive ever had the only real friend
He frowned and bit his lipand felt uncomfortable though he protested to himself that he was simply irritated at her slyness
Yes it must be slyness
So she went on theres no REASON for being on guard
Still I feel that way
She looked at him with sweet gravity
Perhaps I shouldnt if you didnt talk about love to me and kiss me in a way I feel youve no right to
Again he laid his hands upon her shoulders
This time he gazed angrily into her eyes
Are you a fool
Or are you making a fool of me
he said
I cant decide which
I certainly am very foolish was her apologetic answer
I dont know a lot of things like you and father
Im only a girl
And he had the maddening sense of being baffled againof having got nowhere of having demonstrated afresh to himself and to her his own weakness where she was concerned
What unbelievable weakness
Had there ever been such another case
Yes there must have been
How little he had known of the possibil ities of the relations of men and womenhe who had prided himself on knowing all
She said You are going to marry
I suppose so replied he sourly
Are you worried about the expense
Is it costing you too much this helping father
Are you sorry you went into it
He was silent
You are sorry
she exclaimed
You feel that you are wasting your money
His generosity forbade him to keep up the pretense that might aid him in his project
No he said hastily
No indeed
This expenseits nothing
He flushed hung his head in shame before his own weakness as he added in complete surrender Im very glad to be helping your father
I knew you would be
she cried triumphantly
I knew it
And she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him
Thats better
he said with a foolishly delighted laugh
I believe we are beginning to get acquainted
Yes indeed
I feel quite different already
I hoped so
You are coming to your senses
Perhaps
Only She laid a beautiful white pleading hand upon his shoulder and gazed earnestly into his eyesplease dont frighten me with that talk and those other kisses
He looked at her uncertainly
Come round in your own way he said at last
I dont want to hurry you
I suppose every bird has its own way of dropping from a perch
You dont like my way
she inquired
It was said archly but also in the way that always made him vaguely uneasy made him feel like one facing a mystery which should be explored cautiously
It is graceful he admitted with a smile since he could not venture to frown
Gracefulbut slow
She laughedand he could not but feel that the greater laughter in her too innocent eyes was directed at him
She talked of other thingsand he let her charmed yet cursing his folly his slavery the while
X MANY a time he had pitied a woman for letting him get away from her when she obviously wished to hold him and failed solely because she did not understand her business
Like every other man he no sooner began to be attracted by a woman than he began to invest her with a mystery and awe which she either could dissipate by forcing him to see the truth of her commonplaceness or could increase into a power that would enslave him by keeping him agitated and interested and ever satisfied yet ever baffled
But no woman had shown this supreme skill in the art of loveuntil Dorothy Hallowell
She exasperated him
She fascinated him
She kept him so restless that his professional work was all but neglected
Was it her skill
Was it her folly
Was she simply leading him on and on guided blindly by womans instinct to get as much as she could and to give as little as she dared
Or was she protected by a real indifference to himthe strongest indeed the only invulnerable armor a woman can wear
Was she protecting herself
Or was it merely that he weakened by his infatuation was doing the protecting for her
Beside these distracting questions the once all important matter of professional and worldly ambition seemed not worth troubling about
They even so vexed him that he had become profoundly indifferent as to Josephine
He saw her rarely
When they were alone he either talked neutral subjects or sat almost mute hardly conscious of her presence
He received her efforts at the customary caressings with such stolidity that she soon ceased to annoy him
They reduced their outward show of affection to a kiss when they met another when they separated
He was tiredalways tired worn outhalf sickharassed by business concerns
He did not trouble himself about whether his listless excuses would be accepted or not
He did not care what she thoughtor might thinkor might do
Josephine was typical of the women of the comfortable class
For them the fundamentally vital matters of lifethe profoundly harassing questions of food clothing and shelterare arranged and settled
What is there left to occupy their minds
Little but the idle emotions they manufacture and spread foglike over their true natures to hide the barrenness the monotony
They fool with phrases about art or love or religion or charityfor none of those things can be vivid realities to those who are swathed and stupefied in a luxury they have not to take the least thought to provide for themselves
Like all those women Josephine fancied herself complexfancied she was a person of variety and of depth because she repeated with a slight change of wording the things she read in clever books or heard from clever men
There seemed to Norman to be small enough originality personality to the ordinary man of the comfortable class but there was some because his necessity of struggling with and against his fellow men in the several arenas of active life compelled him to be at least a little of a person
In the women there seemed nothing at allnot even in Josephine
When he listened to her when he thought of her nowhe was calmly critical
He judged her as a human specimenjudged much as would have old Newton Hallowell to whom the whole world was mere laboratory
She bored him nowand he made no effort beyond bare politeness to conceal the fact from her
The situation was saved from becoming intolerable by that universal saver of intolerable situations vanity
She had the ordinary human vanity
In addition she had the peculiar vanity of woman the creation of mans flatteries lavished upon the sex he alternately serves and spurns
In further addition she had the vanity of her classthe comfortable class that feels superior to the mass of mankind in fortune in intellect in taste in everything desirable
Heaped upon all these vanities was her vanity of high social rankand atop the whole her vanity of great wealth
None but the sweetest and simplest of human beings can stand up and remain human under such a weight as this
If we are at all fair in our judgments of our fellow men we marvel that the triumphant classespecially the women whose point of view is never corrected by the experiences of practical lifeare not more arrogant more absurdly forgetful of the oneness and the feebleness of humanity
Josephine was by nature one of the sweet and simple souls
And her love for Norman after the habit of genuine love had destroyed all the instinct of coquetry
The womanor the manhas to be indeed interesting indeed an individuality to remain interesting when sincerely in love and so elevated above the petty but potent sex trickeries
Josephine deeply in love was showing herself to Norman in her undisguised natural sweet simplicityand monotony
But while men admire and reverence a sweet and simple feminine soul and love her in plays and between the covers of a book and when she is talking highfaluting abstractions of moralityand wax wroth with any other man who ignores or neglects herthey do not in their own persons become infatuated with her
Passion is too much given to moods for that it has a morbid craving for variety for the mysterious and the baffling
The only thing that saves the race from ruin through passion is the rarity of those by nature or by art expert in using it
Norman felt that he was paying the penalty for his persistent search for this rarity one of the basest tricks of destiny upon man is to give him what he wantswealth or fame or power or the wom an who enslaves
Norman felt that destiny had suddenly revealed its resolve to destroy him by giving him not one of the things he wanted but all
The marriage was not quite two weeks away
About the time that the ordinary plausible excuses for Normans neglect his abstraction his seeming indifference were exhausted Josephines vanity came forward to explain everything to her all to her own glory
As the elysian hour approachedso vanity assured herthe man who loved her as her complex soul and many physical and social advantages deserved was overcome with that shy terror of which she had read in the poets and the novelists
A large income fashionable attire and surroundings a carriage and a maidthese things gave a woman a subtle and superior intellect and soul
How
Why
No one knew
But everyone admitted indeed saw the truth
Further these beingsthese great ladiesaccording to all the accredited poets novelists and other final authorities upon lifealways inspired the most awed and worshipful and diffident feelings in their lovers
Therefore shethe great ladywas getting but her due
She would have liked something else something common and humanmuch better
But having always led her life as the conventions dictated never as the common human heart yearned she had no keen sense of dissatisfaction to rouse her to revolt and to question
Also she was breathlessly busy with trousseau and the other arrangements for the grand wedding
One afternoon she telephoned Norman asking him to come on his way home that evening
I particularly wish to see you she said
He thought her voice sounded rather queer but he did not take sufficient interest to speculate about it
When he was with her in the small drawing room on the second floor he noted that her eyes were regarding him strangely
He thought he understood why when she said Arent you going to kiss me Fred
He put on his goodnatured slightly mocking smile
I thought you were too busy for that sort of thing nowadays
And he bent and kissed her waiting lips
Then he lit a cigarette and seated himself on the sofa beside herthe sofa at right angles to the open fire
Well
he said
She gazed into the fire for full a minute before she said in a voice of constraint What became of that that girlthe Miss Hallowell She broke off abruptly
There was a pause choked with those dizzy pulsations that fill moments of silence and strain
Then with a sob she flung herself against his breast and buried her face in his shoulder
Dont answer
she cried
Im ashamed of myself
Im ashamedashamed
He put his arm about her shoulders
But why shouldnt I answer
said he in the kindly gentle tone we can all assume when a matter that agitates some one else is wholly indifferent to us
Becauseit was aa trap she answered hysterically
Fredthere was a man here this afternoon a man named Tetlow
He got in only because he said he came from you
Norman laughed quietly
Poor Tetlow
he said
He used to be your head clerkdidnt he
And one of my few friends
Hes not your friend Fred
she cried sitting upright and speaking with energy that quivered in her voice and flashed in her fine brown eyes
Hes your enemya snake in the grassa malicious poisonous Normans quiet even laugh interrupted
Oh no said he
Tetlows a good fellow
Anything he said would be what he honestly believedanything he said about me
He pleaded that he was doing it for your good she went on with scorn
They always dolike the people that write father wicked anonymous letters
He this man Tetlowhe said he wanted me for the sake of my love for you to save you from yourself
Norman glanced at her with amused eyes
Well why dont you
But then you ARE doing it
Youre marrying me arent you
Again she put her head upon his shoulder
Indeed I am
she cried
And Id be a poor sort if I let a sneak shake my confidence in you
He patted her shoulder and there was laughter in his voice as he said But I never professed to be trustworthy
Oh I know you USED to She laughed and kissed his cheek
Never mind
Ive heard
But while you were engaged to meabout to marry mewhy you simply couldnt
Couldnt what
inquired he
Do you want me to tell you what he said
I think I know
But do as you like
Maybe Id better tell you
I seem to want to get rid of it
Then do
It was about that girl
She sat upright and looked at him for encouragement
He nodded
She went on He said that if I asked you you would not dare deny you wereweregiving her money
Her and her father
She shrank startled
Then her lips smiled bravely and she said He didnt say anything about her father
No
That was my own correction of his story
She looked at him with wonder and doubt
You arentDOING it Fred
she exclaimed
He nodded
Yes indeed
He looked at her placidly
Why not
You are SUPPORTING her
If you wish to put it that way said he carelessly
My money pays the billsall the bills
Fred
Yes
What is it
Why are you so agitated
He studied her face then rose took a final pull at the cigarette tossed it in the fire
I must be going he said in a cool even voice
She started up in a panic
Fred
What do you mean
Are you angry with me
His calm regard met hers
I do not likethis sort of thing he said
But surely youll explain
Surely Im entitled to an explanation
Why should I explain
You have evidently found an explanation that satisfies you
He drew himself up in a quiet gesture of haughtiness
Besides it has never been my habit to allow myself to be questioned or to explain myself
Her eyes widened with terror
Fred
she gasped
What DO you mean
Precisely what I say said he in the same cool inevitable way
A man came to you with a story about me
You listened
A sufficient answer to the story was that I am marrying you
That answer apparently does not content you
Very well
I shall make no other
She gazed at him uncertainly
She felt him going and going finally
She seized him with desperate fingers cried I AM content
Oh Freddont frighten me this way
He smiled satirically
Are you afraid of the scandalbecause everything for the wedding has gone so far
How can you think that
cried sheperhaps too vigorously a woman would have thought
What else is there for me to think
You certainly havent shown any consideration for me
But you told me yourself that you were false to me
Really
When
She forgot her fear in a gush of rage rising from sudden realization of what she was doingof how leniently and weakly and without pride she was dealing with this man
Didnt you admit Pardon me said he and his manner might well have calmed the wildest tempest of anger
I did not admit
I never admit
I leave that to people of the sort who explain and excuse and apologize
I simply told you I was paying the expenses of a family named Hallowell
But WHY should you do it Fred
His smile was gently satirical
I thought Tetlow told you why
I dont believe him
Then why this excitement
One could understand how the opposition witnesses dreaded facing him
I dont know just why she stammered
It seemed to me you were admitting I mean you were confirming what that man accused you of
And of what did he accuse me
I might say of what do YOU accuse me
When she remained silent he went on I am trying to be reasonable Josephine
I am trying to keep my temper
The look in her eyesthe fear the timiditywas a startling revelation of characterof the cowardice with which love undermines the strongest nature
I know Ive been foolish and incoherent Fred she pleaded
ButI love you
And you remember how I always was afraid of that girl
Just what do you wish to know
Nothing dearnothing
I am not sillily jealous
I ought to be admiring you for your generosityyour charity
Its neither the one nor the other said he with exasperating deliberateness
She quivered
Then WHAT is it
she cried
You are driving me crazy with your evasions
Pleadingly You must admit they ARE evasions
He buttoned his coat in tranquil preparation to depart
She instantly took alarm
I dont mean that
Its my fault not asking you straight out
Fred tell mewont you
But if you are too cross with me thendont tell me
She laughed nervously hiding her submission beneath a seeming of mocking exaggeration of humility
Ill be good
Ill behave
A man who admired her as a figure a man who liked her a man who had no feeling for her beyond the general human feeling of wishing well pretty nearly everybodyin brief any man but one who had loved her and had gotten over it would have deeply pitied and sympathized with her
Fred Norman said his look and his tone coolly calm I am backing Mr Hallowell in a company for which he is doing chemical research work
We are hatching eggs out of the shell so to speak
Also we are aging and rejuvenating arthropods and the like
So far we have declared no dividends
But we have hopes
She gave a hysterical sob of relief
Then its only businessnot the girl at all
Oh yes its the girl too replied he
Shes an officer of the company
In fact it was to make a place for her that I went into the enterprise originally
With an engaging air of frankness he inquired Anything more
She was gazing soberly almost somberly into the fire
Youll not be offended if I ask you one question
Certainly not
Is there anything between you andher
You mean am I having an affair with her
She hung her head but managed to make a slight nod of assent
He laughed
No
He laughed again
No not thus far my dear
He laughed a third time with still stronger and stranger mockery
She congratulated me on my engagement with a sincerity that would have piqued a man who was interested in her
Will you forgive me
Josephine said
What Ive just been feeling and saying and putting you throughits beneath both of us
I suppose a woman no womancan help being nasty where another woman is concerned
With his satirical goodhumored smile I dont in the least blame you
And youll not think less of me for giving way to a thing so vulgar
He kissed her with a carelessness that made her wince But she felt that she deserved itand was grateful
He said Why dont you go over and see for yourself
No doubt Tetlow gave you the address and no doubt you have remembered it
She colored and hastily turned her head
Dont punish me she pleaded
Punish you
What nonsense



Do you want me to take you over
The laboratory would interest youand Miss Hallowell is lovelier than ever
She has an easier life now
Office work wears on women terribly
Josephine looked at him with a beautiful smile of love and trust
You wish to be sure Im cured
Well cant you see that I am
I dont see why you should be
Ive said nothing one way or the other
She laughed gayly
You cant tempt me
Im really cured
I think the only reason I had the attack was because Mr Tetlow so evidently believed he was speaking the truth
No doubt he did think he was
Im sure in the same circumstances Id think of anyone else just what he thinks of me
Then why do you do it Fred
urged she with illconcealed eagerness
It isnt fair to the girl is it
No one but you and Tetlow knows Im doing it
Youre mistaken there dear
Tetlow says a great many people down town are talking about itthat they say you go almost every day to Jersey City to see her
He accuses you of having ruined her reputation
He says she is quite innocent
He blames the whole thing upon you
Norman standing with arms folded upon his broad chest was gazing thoughtfully into the fire
You dont mind my telling you these things
she said anxiously
Of course I know they are lies So everyone is talking about it interrupted he so absorbed that he had not heard her
You dont realize how conspicuous you are
He shrugged his shoulders
Well it cant be helped
You cant afford to be mixed up in a scandal she ventured or to injure a poor little creature Im afraid youll have toto stop it
Stop it
His eyes gleamed with mirth and something else
It isnt my habit to heed gossip
But think of HER Fred
He smiled ironically
What a generous thoughtful dear you are
said he
She blushed
Ill admit I dont like it
Im not jealousbut I wish you werent doing it
So do I
he exclaimed with sudden energy that astonished and disquieted her
So do I
But since it cant be helped I shall go on
Never had she respected him so profoundly
For the first time she had measured strength with him and had been beaten and routed
She fancied herself enormously proud for she labored under the common delusion which mistakes for pride the silly vanity of class or birth or wealth or position
She had imagined she would never lower that cherished pride of hers to any man
And she had lowered it into the dust
No wonder women had loved him she said to herself couldnt he do with them even the haughtiest of them precisely as he pleased
He had not tried to calm much less to end her jealousy on the contrary he had let it flame as high as it would had urged it higher
And she did not dare ask him even as a loving concession to her weakness to give up an affair upon which everybody was putting the natural worst possible construction
On the contrary she had given him leave to go on because she fearedyes knewthat if she tried to interfere he would take it as evidence that they could not get on together
What a man
But there was more to come that day
As he was finishing dressing for dinner his sister Ursula knocked
May I come Frederick
she said
Sure he cried
Im fixing my tie
Ursula in a gown that displayed the last possible many of the homelier women said impossibleinch of her beautiful shoulders came strolling sinuously in and seated herself on the arm of the divan
She watched him in his evening shirt as he with much struggling did his tie
How young you do look Fred
said she
Especially in just that much clothes
Not a day over thirty
Im not exactly a nonogenarian retorted he
But usually your facein spite of its smoothness and no wrinkleshas a kind of an old youngor do I mean young oldlook
Youve led such a serious life
Um
Thats the devil of it
Youre looking particularly young tonight
Same to you Urse
No Im not bad for thirtyfour
People half believe me when I say Im twentynine
She glanced complacently down at her softly glistening shoulders
Ive still got my skin
And a mighty good one it is
Best I ever saw except one
She reflected a moment then smiled
I know it isnt Josephines
Hers is good but not notable
Eyes and teeth are her strongholds
I suppose itsthe other ladys
Exactly
I mean the one in Jersey City
He went on brushing his hair with not a glance at the bomb she had exploded under his very nose
Youre a cool one she said admiringly
Cool
I thought youd jump
Im sure you never dreamed I knew
He slid into his white waistcoat and began to button it
Though you might know Id find out she went on when everyones talking
Everyones always talking said he indifferently
And they rattle on to beat the band when they get a chance at a man like you
Do you know what theyre saying
Certainly
Loosen these straps in the back of my waistcoatthe upper ones wont you
As she fussed with the buckles she said But you dont know that they say youre going to pieces neglecting your caseskeeping away from your office wasting about half of your day with your lady love
They say that you have gone stark madthat you are rushing to ruin
A little looser
Thats better
Thanks
And everyones wondering when Josephine will hear and go on the rampage
Shes so proud and so stuck on herself that theyre betting shell give you the bounce
Well getting into his coatyoud delight in that
For you dont like her
Ohsoso replied Ursula
Shes all right as women go
You know we women dont ever think any too well of each other
Were on
Now Im frank to admit Im not worth the powder to blow me up
I cant do anything worth doing
I dont know anything worth knowingexcept how to dress and make a fool of an occasional man
Im not a good house keeper nor a good wifeand Id as lief go to jail for two years as have a baby
But I admit Im n g Most women are as poor excuses as I am yet they think theyre GRAND
Norman standing before his sister and smiling mysteriously said My dear Urse let me give you a great truth in a sentence
The value of anything is not its value to itself or in itself but its value to some one else
A womaneven as incompetent a person as you Or Josephine
or Josephinemay seem to some man to be pricelessly valuable
And if she happens to seem so to him why she IS so
MeaningJersey City
His eyes glittered curiously
Meaning Jersey City he said
A long silence
Then Ursula But suppose Josephine hears
He stood beside the doorway waiting for her to pass out
His face expressed nothing
Lets go down
Im hungry
We were talking about it this afternoon
You and Jo
Josephine and I
And its all right
Why not
You fooled her
I dont stoop to that sort of thing
No indeed she laughed
You rise to heights of deception that would make anyone else giddy
Oh Id give anything to have heard
Theres nothing to deceive about said he
She shook her head
You cant put it over me Fred
Youve never before made a fool of yourself about a woman
Id like to see her
I suppose Id be amazed
Ive observed that the women who do the most extraordinary things with men are the most ordinary sort of women
Not to the men said he bitterly
Not while theyre doing it
Does SHE seem extraordinary to YOU still
He thrust his hands deep in his pockets
What you heard is true
Im letting everything slidework careereverything
I think of nothing else
Ursula Im mad about hermad
She threw back her head looked at him admiringly
Never had she so utterly worshiped this wonderful powerful brother of hers
He was in lovereally madly in loveat last
So he was perfect
How long do you think it will hold Fred
she said all sympathy
God knows
Yetcaring for her you can go on and marry another woman
He looked at his sister cynically
You wouldnt have me marry HER would you
Of course not protested she hastily
Her passion for romance did not carry her to that idiocy
You couldnt
Shes a sort of working girlisnt sheanyhow that class
No you couldnt marry her
But how can you marry another woman
How could I give up Josephineand give her up probably to Bob Culver
Ursula nodded understandingly
Butwhat are you going to do
How should I know
Perhaps break it off when I marryif you can call it breaking off when theres nothing to break butme
You dont mean she cried stopping when her tone had carried her meaning
He laughed
Yesthats the kind of damn fool Ive been
You must have let her see how crazy you were about her
Was anyone ever able to hide that sort of insanity
Ursula gazed wonderingly at him drew a long breath
You
she exclaimed
Of all menyou
Lets go down
She must be a deep onedangerous said Ursula furious against the woman who was daring to resist her matchless brother
Fred Im wild to see her
Maybe Id see something thatd help cure you
You keep out of it he replied curtly but not with ill humor
It cant last long
Itd do for me if it did
The marriage will settle everything said Ursula with confidence
Its got to said he grimly
XI THE next day or the next but one Dorothy telephoned him
He often called her up on one pretext or another or frankly for no reason at all beyond the overwhelming desire to hear her voice
But she had never before disturbed him
He had again and again assured her that he would not regard himself as disturbed no matter what he might be doing
She would not have it so
As he was always watching for some faint sign that she was really interested in him this call gave him a thrill of hopea specimen of the minor absurdities of those days of extravagant folly
Are you coming over today
she asked
Right away if you wish
Oh no
Any time will do
Ill come at once
Im not busy
No
Late this afternoon
Father asked me to call up and make sure
He wants to see you
Ohnot you
Im a business person retorted she
I know better than to annoy you as Ive often said
He knew it was foolish tiresome yet he could not resist the impulse to say Now that Ive heard your voice I cant stay away
Ill come over to lunch
Her answering voice was irritated
Please dont
Im cleaning house
Youd be in the way
He shrank and quivered like a boy who has been publicly rebuked
Ill come when you say he replied
Not a minute before four oclock
Thats a long timenow youve made me crazy to see you
Dont talk nonsense
I must go back to work
What are you doing
he asked to detain her
Dusting and polishing
Molly did the sweeping and is cleaning windows now
What have you got on
How silly you are
No one knows that better than I
But I want to have a picture of you to look at
Ive got on an old white skirt and an old shirt waist both dirty and a pair of tennis shoes that were white once but are gray now where they arent black
And Ive got a pink chiffon rag tied round my hair
Pink is wonderful when you wear it
I look a fright
And my face is streakedand my arms
Oh youve got your sleeves rolled up
Thats an important detail
Youre making fun of me
No Im thinking of your arms
They are ravishing
Thats quite enough
Goodby
And she rang off
He was used to her treating compliment and flattery from him in that fashion
He could notor was it would notunderstand why
He had learned that she was not at all the indifferent and unaware person in the matter of her physical charms he had at first fancied her
On the contrary she had more than her share of physical vanitynot more than was her right in view of her charms but more than she could carry off well
With many a secret smile he had observed that she thought herself perfect physically
This did not repel him it never does repel a manwhen and so long as he is under the enchantment of the charms the woman more or less exaggerates
But while he had often seen women with inordinate physical vanity so often that he had come to regarding it as an essential part of feminine character never before had he seen one so content with her own good opinion of herself that she was indifferent to appreciation from others
He did not go back to the office after lunch
Several important matters were coming up if he got within reach they might conspire to make it impossible for him to be with her on time
If his partners his clients knew
He the important man of affairs kneeling at the feet of a nobodyand why
Chiefly because he was unable to convince her that he amounted to anything
His folly nauseated him
He sat in a corner in the dining room of the Lawyers Club and drank one whisky and soda after another and brooded over his follies and his unhappiness muttering monotonously from time to time No wonder she makes a fool of me
I invite it I beg for it damned idiot that I am
By three oclock he had drunk enough liquor to have dispatched the average man for several days
It had produced no effect upon him beyond possibly a slight aggravation of his moodiness
It took only twenty minutes to get from New York to her house
He set out at a few minutes after three arrived at twenty minutes to four
As experience of her ways had taught him that she was much less friendly when he disobeyed her requests he did not dare go to the house but after looking at it from a corner two blocks away made a detour that would use up some of the time he had to waste
And as he wandered he indulged in his usual alternations between selfderision and passion
He appeared at the house at five minutes to four
Patrick who with Molly his wife looked after the domestic affairs was at the front gate gazing down the street in the direction from which he always came
At sight of him Pat came running
Norman quickened his pace and every part of his nervous system was in turmoil
Mr HallowellhesDEAD gasped Pat
Dead
echoed Norman
Three quarters of an hour ago sir
He came from the lobatry walked in the sitting room where Miss Dorothy was oiling the furniture and I was oiling the floor
And he sets downand he looks at heras cool and calm as could beand he says Dorothy my child Im dying
And she stands up straight and looks at him curious likejust curious like
And he says Dorothy goodby
And he shivers and I jumps up just in time to catch him from rolling to the floor
He was dead thenso the doctor says
Dead
repeated Norman looking round vaguely
He went on to the house Pat walking beside him and chattering on and ona stream of words Norman did not hear
As he entered the open front door Dorothy came down the stairs
He had thought he knew how white her skin was
But he did not know until then
And from that ghostly pallor looked the eyes of grief beyond tears
He advanced toward her
But she seemed to be wrapped in an atmosphere of aloofness
He felt himself a stranger and an alien
After a brief silence she said I dont realize it
Ive been upstairs where Pat carried himbut I dont realize it
It simply cant be
Do you know what he wished to say to me
he asked
No
I guess he felt this coming
Probably it came quicker than he expected
Now I can see that he hasnt been well for several days
But he would never let anything about illness be said
He thought talking of those things made them worse
You have relativessomebody you wish me to telegraph
She shook her head
No one
Our relatives out West are second cousins or further away
They care nothing about us
No Im all alone
The tears sprang to his eyes
But there were no tears in her eyes no forlornness in her voice
She was simply stating a fact
He said Ill look after everything
Dont give it a moments thought
No Ill arrange replied she
Itll give me something to dosomething to do for him
You see its my last chance
And she turned to ascend the stairs
Something to do she repeated dully
I wish I hadnt cleaned house this morning
That would be something more to do
This jarred on himthen brought the tears to his eyes again
How childish she wasand how desolate
But youll let me stay
he pleaded
Youll need me
At any rate I want to feel that you do
Id rather you didnt stay she said in the same calm remote way
Id rather be alone with him this last time
Ill go up and sit there until they take him away
And thenin a few days Ill see what to do Ill send for you
I cant leave you at such a time he cried
You havent realized yet
When you do you will need some one
You dont understand she interrupted
He and I understood each other in some ways
I know hed not wantanyone round
At her slight hesitation before anyone he winced
I must be alone with him she went on
Thank you but I want to go now
Not just yet he begged
Then seeing the shadow of annoyance on her beautiful white face he rose and said Im going
I only want to help you
He extended his hand impulsively drew it back before she had the chance to refuse it
For he felt that she would refuse it
He said You know you can rely on me
But I dont need anybody replied she
Goodby
If I can do anything Pat will telephone
She was already halfway upstairs
He found Pat in the front yard and arranged with him to get news and to send messages by way of the drug store at the corner so that she would know nothing about it
He went to a florists in New York and sent masses of flowers
And thenthere was nothing more to do
He stopped in at the club and drank and gambled until far into the morning
He fretted gloomily about all the next day riding alone in the Park driving with his sister drinking and gambling at the club again and smiling cynically to himself at the covert glances his acquaintances exchanged
He was growing used to those glances
He cared not the flip of a penny for them
On the third day came the funeral and he went
He did not let his cabman turn in behind the one carriage that followed the hearse
At the graveyard he stood afar off watching her in her simple new black noting her calm
She seemed thinner but he thought it might be simply her black dress
He could see no change in her face
As she was leaving the grave she looked in his direction but he was uncertain whether she had seen him
Pat and Molly were in the big gloomy looking carriage with her
He ventured to go to the front gate an hour later
Pat came out
Its no use to go in Mr Norman he said
Shell not see you
Shes shut up in her own room
Hasnt she cried yet Pat
Not yet
Were waiting for it sir
Were afraid her mind will give way
At least Molly is
I dont think so
Shes a queer young ladyas queer as she looksthough at first youd never think it
Shes always looking different
I never seen so many persons in one
Cant Molly MAKE her cryby talking about him
Shes tried sir
It wasnt no use
Why Miss Dorothy talks about him just as if he was still here
Pat wiped the sweat from his forehead
Ive been in many a house of mourning but never through such a strain as this
Somehow I feel as if Id never before been round where there was anyone thatd lost somebody they REALLY cared about
Weeping and moaning dont amount to much beside what shes doing
Norman stayed round for an hour or more then rushed away distracted
He drank like a madman drank himself into a daze and so got a few hours of a kind of sleep
He was looking haggard and wild now and everyone avoided him though in fact there was not the least danger of an outburst of temper
His sisterJosephinethe officeseveral clients telephoned for him
To all he sent the same refusalthat he was too ill to see anyone
Not until the third day after the funeral did Dorothy telephone for him
He took an icecold bath got himself together as well as he could and reached the house in Jersey City about half past three in the afternoon
She came gliding into the room like a ghost trailing a black negligee that made the whiteness of her skin startling
Her eye lids were heavy and dark but unreddened
She gazed at him with calm clear melancholy and his heart throbbed and ached for her
She seated herself clasped her hands loosely in her lap and said Ive sent for you so that I could settle things up
Your fathers affairs
Cant I do it better
He had arranged everything
There are only the papershis notesand he wrote out the addresses of the men they were to be sent to
No I mean settle things up with you
You mustnt bother about that said he
Besides theres nothing to settle
I shant pretend Im going to try to pay you back she went on as if he had not spoken
I never could do it
But you will get part at least by selling this furniture and the things at the laboratory
Dorothyplease he implored
Dont you understand youre to stay on here just the same
What sort of man do you think I am
I did this for you and you know it
But I did it for my father replied she and hes gone
She was resting her melancholy gaze upon him
I couldnt take anything from you
You didnt think I was that kind
He was silent
I cared nothing about the scandalwhat people saidso long as I was doing it for him



Id have done ANYTHING for him
Sometimes I thought you were going to compel me to do things Id have hated to do
I hope I wronged you but I feared you meant that
She sat thinking several minutes sighed wearily
Its all over now
It doesnt matter
I neednt bother about it any more
Dorothy lets not talk of these things now said Norman
Theres no hurry
I want you to wait until you are calm and have thought everything over
Then Im sure youll see that you ought to stay on
How could I
she asked wonderingly
Why not
Am I demanding anything of you
You know Im notand that I never shall
But theres no reason on earth why YOU should support ME
I can work
Why shouldnt I
And if I didnt if I stayed on here what sort of woman would I be
He was unable to find an answer
He was trying not to see a look in her faceor was it in her soul revealed through her eyesa look that made him think for the first time of a resemblance between her and her father
You see yourself Ive got to go
Any money I could earn wouldnt more than pay for a room and board somewhere
You can let me advance you money while you He hesitated had an idea which he welcomed eagerly while you study for the stage
Yes thats the sensible thing
You can learn to act
Then you will be able to make a decent living
She slowly shook her head
Ive no talent for it and no liking
No Mr Norman I must go back to workand right away
But at least wait until youve looked into the stage business he urged
You may find that you like it and that you have talent for it
I cant take any more from you she said
You think I am not to be trusted
Im not going to say now how I feel toward you
But I can honestly say one thing
Now that you are all alone and unprotected you neednt have the least fear of me
She smiled faintly
I see you dont believe me
Well it doesnt matter
Ive seen Mr Tetlow and he has given me a place at twelve a week in his office
Norman sank back in his chair
He is in for himself now
No
Hes head clerk for Pitchley  Culver
Culver
exclaimed Norman
I dont want you to go into Culvers office
Hes a scoundrel
Again Dorothy smiled faintly
Norman colored
I know he stands wellas well as I do
But I cant trust you with him
That sounds ridiculous butits true
I think I can trust myself she said quietly
Her grave regard fixed his
Dont you
she asked
His eyes lowered
Yes he replied
Butwhy shouldnt you come back with us
Ill see that you get a much better position than Culvers giving you
Over her face crept one of those mysterious transformations that made her so bafflingly fascinating to him
Behind that worldlywise satirical mask was she mocking at him
All she said was I couldnt work there
Ive settled it with Mr Tetlow
I go to work tomorrow
Tomorrow
he cried starting up
And Ive found a place to live
Pat and Molly will take care of things for you here
Dorothy
You dont MEAN this
Youre not going to break off
I shant see you againexcept as we may meet by accident
Do you realize what youre saying means to me
he cried
Dont you know how I love you
He advanced toward her
She stood and waited passively looking at him
Dorothymy lovedo you want to kill me
When are you to be married
she asked quietly
You are playing with me
he cried
You are tormenting me
What have I ever done that you should treat me this way
He caught her unresisting hands and kissed them
Dearmy deardont you care for me at all
No she said placidly
Ive always told you so
He seized her in his arms kissed her with a frenzy that was savage ferocious
You will drive me mad
You HAVE driven me mad
he muttered
And he added unconscious that he was speaking his thoughts so distracted was he You MUST love meyou MUST
No woman has ever resisted me
You cannot
She drew herself away from him stood before him like snow like ice
One thing I have never told you
Ill tell you now she said deliberately
I despise you
He fell back a step and the chill of her coldness seemed to be freezing the blood in his veins
Ive always despised you she went on and he shivered before that contemptuous wordit seemed only the more contemptuous for her calmness
Sometimes Ive despised you thoroughlyagain only a littlebut always that feeling
For a moment he thought she had at last stung his pride into the semblance of haughtiness
He was able to look at her with mocking eyes and to say I congratulate you on your cleverness in concealing your feelings
It wasnt my cleverness she said wearily
It was your blindness
I never deceived you
No you never have he replied sincerely
Perhaps I deserve to be despised
Again perhaps if you knew the worldthe one I live inbetter youd think less harshly of me
I dont think harshly of you
How could I after all you did for my father
Dorothy if youll stay here and study for the stageor anything you chooseI promise you Ill never speak of my feeling for youor show it in any wayunless you yourself give me leave
She smiled with childlike pathos
You ought not to tempt me
Do you want me to keep on despising you
Cant you ever be fair with me
The sad frank gentleness of the appeal swung his unhinged mind to the other extremefrom the savagery of passion to a frenzy of remorse
Fair to YOU
No he cried because I love you
Oh Im ashamed bitterly ashamed
Im capable of any baseness to get you
Youre right
You cant trust me
In going youre saving me from myself
He hesitated stared wildly appalled at the words that were fighting for utterancethe words about marriageabout marrying her
He said hoarsely I am madmad
I dont know what Im saying
Goodby For Gods sake dont think the worst of me Dorothy
Goodby
I WILL be a man againI will
And he wrung her hand and talking incoherently he rushed from the room and from the house
XII HE went straight home and sought his sister
She had that moment come in from tea after a matinee
She talked about the playhow badly it was acted and about the women she had seen at teahow badly dressed they were
Its hard to say which is the more dreadfulthe ugly misshapen human race without clothes or in the clothes it insists on wearing
And the talk at that tea
Does no one ever say a pleasant thing about anyone
Doesnt anyone ever do a pleasant thing that can be spoken about
I read this morning Tolstoys advice about resolving to think all day only nice thoughts and sticking to it
That sounded good to me and I decided to try it
Ursula laughed and squirmed about in her tightfitting dress that made an enchanting display of her figure
What is one to do
I cant be a fraud for one
And if I had stuck to my resolution Id have spent the day in lying
Whats the matter Fred
Now that her attention was attracted she observed more closely
What HAVE you been doing
You lookfrightful
Ive broken with her replied he
With Jo
she cried
Why Fred you cant you cantwith the wedding only five days away
Not with Jo
Ursula breathed noisy relief
She said cheerfully Ohwith the other
Well Im glad its over
Over
said he sardonically
Over
Its only begun
But youll stick it out Fred
Youve made a fool of yourself long enough
What was the girl playing for
Marriage
He nodded
I guess so
He laughed curtly
And she almost won
Ursula smiled with fine mockery
Almost but not quite
I know you men
Women do that sort of fool thing
But menneverat least not the ambitious snobbish New York men
She almost won he repeated
At least I almost did it
If I had stayed a minute longer Id have done it
You like to think you would mocked Ursula
But if you had tried to say the words your lungs would have collapsed your vocal chords snapped and your tongue shriveled
I am not so damn sure I shant do it yet he burst out fiercely
But I am said Ursula calm brisk practical
Whats she going to do
Going to work
Ursula laughed joyously
What a joke
A woman go to work when she neednt
She is going to work
To work another man
She meant it
How easily women fool meneven the wise men like you
She meant it
She still hopes to marry youor she has heard of your marriage Norman lifted his head
Into his face came the cynical suspicious expression
And has fastened on some other man
Or perhaps shes found some good provider whos willing to marry her
Norman sprang up his eyes blazing his mouth working cruelly
By God
he cried
If I thought that
His sister was alarmed
Such a manin such a deliriummight commit any absurdity
He flung himself down in despair
Urse why cant I get rid of this thing
Its ruining me
Its killing me
Your good sense tells you if you had her youd be over it She snapped her fingerslike that
YesyesI know it
But He groaned she has broken with me
Ursula went to him and kissed him and took his head in her arms
What a BOYboy it is
she said tenderly
Oh it must be dreadful to have always had whatever one wanted and then to find something one cant have
We women are used to itand the usual sort of man
But not your sort Freddyand Im so sorry for you
I want her UrseI want her he groaned and he was almost sobbing
My God I CANT get on without her
Now Freddy dear listen to me
You know shes way way beneath youthat she isnt at all what youve got in the habit of picturing herthat its all delusion and nonsense I want her he repeated
I want her
Youd be ashamed if you had her as a wife wouldnt you
He was silent
She isnt a LADY
I dont know replied he
She hasnt any sense
A low sort of cunning yes
But not brainsnot enough to hold you
I dont know replied he
Shes got enough for a woman
AndI WANT her
She isnt to be compared with Josephine
But I dont want Josephine
I want HER
But which do you want to MARRYto bring forward as your wifeto spend your life with
I know
Im a mad fool
But Urse I cant help it
He stood up suddenly
Ive used every weapon Ive got
Even prideand it skulked away
My sense of humorand it weakened
My willand it snapped
Is she so wonderful
She is soelusive
I cant understand herI cant touch her
I cant find her
She keeps me going like a man chasing an echo
Like a man chasing an echo repeated Ursula reflectively
I understand
It is maddening
She must be cleverin her way
Or very simple
God knows which I dontand sometimes I think she doesnt either
He made a gesture of dismissal
Well its finished
I must pull myself togetheror try to
You will said his sister confidently
A fortnight from now youll be laughing at yourself
I am now
I have been all along
Butit does no good
She had to go and dress
But she could not leave until she had tried to make him comfortable
He was drinking brandy and soda and staring at his feet which were stretched straight out toward the fire
Wheres your sense of humor
she demanded
Throw yourself on your sense of humor
Its a friend that sticks when all others fail
Its my only hope he said with a grim smile
I can see myself
No wonder she despises me
Despises you
scoffed Ursula
A WOMAN des pise YOU
Shes crazy about you Ill bet anything you like
Before youre through with this youll find out Im right
And thenyoull have no use for her
She despises me
Wellwhat of it
Really Fred it irritates me to see you absolutely unlike yourself
Why youre as brokenspirited as a henpecked old husband
Just that he admitted rising and looking drearily about
I dont know what the devil to do next
Everything seems to have stopped
Going to see Josephine this evening
I suppose so was his indifferent reply
Youll have to dress after dinner
Theres no time now
Dress
he inquired vaguely
Why dress
Why do anything
She thought he would not go to Josephine but would hide in his club and drink
But she was mistaken
Toward nine oclock he in evening dress with the expression of a horse in a treadmill rang the bell of Josephines house and passed in at the big bronze doors
The butler must have particularly admired the way he tossed aside his coat and hat
As soon as he was in the presence of his fiancee he saw that she was again in the throes of some violent agitation
She began at once Ive just had the most frightful scene with father she said
Hes been hearing a lot of stuff about you down town and it set him wild
Do you mind if I smoke a cigar
said he looking at her unseeingly with haggard cold eyes
And may I have some whisky
She rang
I hope the servants didnt hear him she said
Then as a step sounded outside she put on an air of gayety as if she were still laughing at some jest he had made
In the doorway appeared her father one of those big men who win half the battle in advance on personal appearance of unconquerable might
Burroughs was noted for his generosity and for his violent temper
As a rule men of the largeness necessary to handling large affairs are free from petty vindictiveness
They are too busy for hatred
They do not forgive they are most careful not to forget they simply stand ready at any moment to do whatever it is to their interest to do regardless of friendships or animosities
Burroughs was an exception in that he got his highest pleasure out of pursuing his enemies
He enjoyed this so keenly that several timesso it was saidhe had sacrificed real money to satisfy a revenge
But these rumors may have wronged him
It is hardly probable that a man who would let a weakness carry him to that pitch of folly could have escaped destruction
For of all the follies revenge is the most dangerous as well as the most fatuous
Burroughs had a big face
Had he looked less powerful the bigness of his features the spread of cheek and jowl would have been grotesque
As it was the face was impressive especially when one recalled how many many millions he owned and how many more he controlled
The control was better than the ownership
The millions he owned made him a cowardhe was afraid he might lose them
The millions he controlled and of course used for his own enrichment made him brave for if they were lost in the daring ventures in which he freely staked them why the loss was not his and he could shift the blame
Usually Norman treated him with great respect for his business gave the firm nearly half its total income and it was his daughter and his wealth prestige and power that Norman was marrying
But this evening he looked at the great man with a superciliousness that was peculiarly disrespectful from so young a man to one well advanced toward old age
Norman had been feeling relaxed languid exhausted
The signs of battle in that powerful face nerved him keyed him up at once
He waited with a joyful impatience while the servant was bringing cigars and whisky
The enormous quantities of liquor he had drunk in the last few days had not been without effect
Alcohol the general stimulant inevitably brings out in strong relief a mans dominant qualities
The dominant quality of Norman was love of combat
Josephine tells me you are in a blue fury said Norman pleasantly when the door was closed and the three were alone
Nonot a blue fury
A black fury
At the covert insolence of his tone Josephine became violently agitated
Father she said with the imperiousness of an only and indulged child I have asked you not to interfere between Fred and me
I thought I had your promise
I said Id think about it replied her father
He had a heavy voice that now and then awoke some string of the lower octaves of the piano in the corner to a dismal groan
Ive decided to speak out
Thats right sir said Norman
Is your quarrel with me
Josephine attempted an easy laugh
Its that silly story we were talking about the other day Fred
I supposed so said he
You are not smoking Mr Burroughs He laughed amiablyat least not a cigar
The doctor only allows me one and Ive had it replied Burroughs his eyes sparkling viciously at this flick of the whip
What is the truth about that business Norman
Normans amused glance encountered the savage glare mockingly
Why do you ask
he inquired
Because my daughters happiness is at stake
Because I cannot but resent a low scandal about a man who wishes to marry my daughter
Very proper sir said Norman graciously
My daughter continued Burroughs with accele rating anger tells me you have denied the story
illust
caption   Father 


I have asked you not to interfere between Fred and me
 Norman interrupted with an astonished look at Josephine
She colored gazed at him imploringly
His face terrified her
When body and mind are in health and at rest the fullness of the face hides the character to a great extent
But when a human being is sick or very tired the concealing roundness goes and in the clearly marked features the true character is revealed
In Normans face haggard by his wearing emotions his character stood forththe traits of strength of tenacity of inevitable purpose
And Josephine saw and dreaded
But Burroughs went on I have it on the best authority that it is true
Norman looking into the fascinating face of danger was thrilled
Then you wish to break off the engagement
he said in the gentlest smoothest tone
Burroughs brought his fist down on the tableand Norman recognized the gesture of the bluffer
I wish you to break off with that woman
he cried
I insist upon itupon positive assurances from you
Fred
pleaded Josephine
Dont listen to him
Remember I have said nothing
He had long been looking for a justifying grievance against her
It now seemed to him that he had found it
Why should you
he said genially but with subtle irony since you are getting your father to speak for you
There was just enough truth in this to entangle her and throw her into disorder
She had been afraid of the consequences of her fathers interfering with a man so spirited as Norman but at the same time she had longed to have some one put a check upon him
Normans suave remark made her feel that he could see into her inmost soulcould see the anger the jealousy the doubt the hatredtinged love the lovesaturated hate seething and warring there
Burroughs was saying If we had not committed ourselves so deeply I should deal very differently with this matter
Why should that deter you
said Normanand Josephine gave a piteous gasp
If this goes much farther I assure you I shall not be deterred
Burroughs firmly planted in a big leather chair looked at the young man in puzzled amazement
I see you think you have us in your power he said at last
But you are mistaken
On the contrary rejoined the young man I see you believe you have me in your power
And in a sense you are NOT mistaken
Father he is right cried Josephine agitatedly
I shouldnt love and respect him as I do if he would submit to this hectoring
Hectoring
exclaimed Burroughs
Josephine leave the room
I cannot discuss this matter properly before you
I hope you will not leave Josephine said Nor man
There is nothing to be said that you cannot and ought not to hear
Im not an infant father said Josephine
Besides it is as Fred says
He has done nothing improper
Then why does he not say so
demanded Burroughs seeing a chance to recede from his former too advanced position
Thats all I ask
But I told you all about it father said Josephine angrily
Theyve been distorting the truth and the truth is to his credit
Norman avoided the glance she sent to him it was only a glance and away for more formidably than ever his power was enthroned in his haggard face
He stood with his back to the fire and it was plain that the muscles of his strong figure were braced to give and to receive a shock
Mr Burroughs he said your daughter is mistaken
Perhaps it is my fault in having helped her to mislead herself
The plain truth is I have become infatuated with a young woman
She cares nothing about mehas repulsed me
I have been and am making a fool of myself about her
Ive been hoping to cure myself
I still hope
But I am not cured
There was absolute silence in the room
Norman stole a glance at Josephine
She was sitting erect a greenish pallor over her ghastly face
He said If she will take me now that she knows the truth I shall be gratefuland I shall make what effort I can to do my best
He looked at her and she at him
And for an instant her eyes softened
There was the appeal of weak human heart to weak human heart in his gaze
Her lip quivered
A brief struggle between vanity and love and vanity the stronger the strongest force in her life dominating it since earliest babyhood and only seeming to give way to love when love cameit was vanity that won
She stiffened herself and her mouth curled with proud scorn
She laugheda sneer of jealous rage
Father she said the lady in the case is a common typewriter in his office
But to menespecially to practical men differences of rank and position among women are not fundamentally impressive
Man is in the habit of taking what he wants in the way of womankind wherever he finds it and he understands that habit in other men
He was furious with Norman but he did not sympathize with his daughters extreme attitude
He said to Norman sharply You say you have broken with the woman
She has broken with me replied Norman
At any rate everything is broken off
Apparently
Then there is no reason why the marriage should not go on
He turned to his daughter
If you understood men you would attach no importance to this matter
As you yourself said the woman isnt a lady isnt in our class
That sort of thing amounts to nothing
Norman has acted well
He has shown the highest kind of honestyhas been truthful where most men would have shifted and lied
Anyhow things have gone too far
Not without the soundest reasons had Burroughs accepted Norman as his soninlaw and he had no fancy for giving him up when men of his preeminent fitness were so rare
There was another profound silence
Josephine looked at Norman
Had he returned her gaze the event might have been different for within her there was now going on a struggle between two nearly evenly matched vanitiesthe vanity of her own outraged pride and the vanity of what the world would say and think if the engagement were broken off at that time and in those circumstances
But he did not look at her
He kept his eyes fixed upon the opposite wall and there was no sign of emotion of any kind in his stony features
Josephine rose suppressed a sob looked arrogant scorn from eyes shining with tearstears of self pity
Send him away father she said
He has tried to degrade ME
I am done with him
And she rushed from the room her father half starting from his chair to detain her
He turned angrily on Norman
A hell of a mess youve made
he cried
A hell of a mess replied the young man
Of course shell come round
But youve got to do your part
Its settled said Norman
And he threw his cigar into the fireplace
Good night
Hold on
cried Burroughs
Before you go you must see Josie alone and talk with her
It would be useless said Norman
You know her
Burroughs laid his hand friendlily but heavily upon the young mans shoulder
This outburst of nonsense might cost you two young people your happiness for life
This is no time for jealousy and false pride
Wait a moment
Very well said Norman
But it is useless
He understood Josephine nowhe who had become a connoisseur of love
He knew that her vanityfounded love had vanished
Burroughs disappeared in the direction his daughter had taken
Norman waited several minuteslong enough slowly to smoke a cigarette
Then he went into the hall and put on his coat with deliberation
No one appeared not even a servant
He went out into the street
In the morning papers he found the announcement of the withdrawal of the invitationsand from half a column to several columns of comment much of it extremely unflattering to him
XIII WHEN a high life engagement such as that of Norman and Miss Burroughs collapses on the eve of the wedding the gossip and the scandal however great are but a small part of the mess
Doubtless many a marriageand not in high life alone eitherhas been put through although the one party or the other or both have discovered that disaster was inevitablesolely because of the appalling muddle the sensible course would precipitate
In the case of the NormanBurroughs fiasco there wereto note only a few big items such difficulties as several car loads of presents from all parts of the earth to be returned a house furnished throughout and equipped to the last scullery maid and stable boy to be disposed of the entire Burroughs domestic economy which had been reconstructed to be put back upon its former basis
It is not surprising that as Ursula Fitzhugh was credibly informed Josephine almost decided to send for Bob Culver and marry him on the day before the day appointed for her marriage to Fred
The reason given for her not doing this sounded plausible
Culver despairing of making the match on which his ambition and therefore his heart was setand seeing a chance to get suddenly rich had embarked for a career as a blackmailer of corporations
That is he nosed about for a big corporation stealthily doing or arranging to do some unlawful but highly profitable acts he bought a few shares of its stock using a fake client as a blind he then proceeded to threaten it with exposure expensive hindrances and the like unless it bought him off at a huge profit to himself
This business was regarded as most disreputable andthanks to the power of the big corporations over the courtshad resulted in the sending of several of its practisers to jail or on hasty journeys to foreign climes
But Culver almost if not quite as good a lawyer as Norman was too clever to be caught in that way
However while he was getting very rich rapidly he was as yet far from rich enough to overcome the detestation of old Burroughs and to be eligible for the daughter
So Josephine sailed away to Europe with the consolation that her father was so chagrined by the fizzle that he had withdrawn his veto upon the purchase of a foreign titlethat veto having been the only reason she had looked at home for a husband
Strange indeed are the ways of lovenever stranger than when it comes into contact with the vanities of wealth and social position and the other things that cause a human being to feel that he or she is lifted clear of and high above the human condition
Josephine had her consolation
For Norman the only consolation was escape from a marriage which had become so irksome in anticipation that he did not dare think what it would be in the reality
Over against this consolation was set a long list of disasters
He found himself immediately shunned by all his friends
Their professed reason was that he had acted shabbily in the breaking of the engagement for while it was assumed that Josephine must have done the actual breaking it was also assumed that he must have given her provocation and to spare
This virtuous indignation was in large part mere pretext as virtuous indignation in frail mortals toward frail mortals is apt to be
The real reason for shying off from Norman was his atmosphere of impending downfall
And certainly that atmosphere had eaten away and dissipated all his former charm
He looked dull and boresomeand he was
But the chief disaster was material
As has been said old Burroughs in his own person and in the enterprises he controlled gave Normans firm about half its income
The day Josephine sailed Lockyer senior partner of the firm got an intimation that unless Norman left Burroughs would take his law business elsewhere and would advise others of their clients to follow his example
Lockyer no sooner heard than he began to bestir himself
He called into consultation the learned Benchley and the astute Sanders and the soft and sly Lockyer junior
There could be no question that Norman must be got rid of
The only point was who should inform the lion that he had been deposed
After several hours of anxious discussion Lockyer his inward perturbations hid beneath that mask of smug and statesmanlike respectability entered the lions den a sick lion sick unto death probably but not a dead lion
When youre ready to go uptown Frederick said he in his gentlest most patriarchal manner let me know
I want to have a little talk with you
Norman heavy eyed and listless looked at the handsome old fraud
As he looked something of the piercing quality and something of the humorous came back into his eyes
Sit down and say it now said he
Id prefer to talk where we can be quiet
Norman rang his bell and when an office boy appeared said No one is to disturb me until I ring again
Then as the boy withdrew he said to Lockyer Now sir what is it
Lockyer strolled to the window looked out as if searching for something he failed to find came back to the chair on the opposite side of the desk from Norman seated himself
I dont know how to begin said he
It is hard to say painful things to anyone I have such an affection for as I have for you
Norman pushed a sheet of letter paper across the desk toward his partner
Perhaps that will help you observed he carelessly
Lockyer put on his nose glasses with the gesture of grace and intellect that was famous
He reada brief demand for a release from the partnership and a request for an immediate settlement
Lockyer blinked off his glasses with the gesture that was as famous and as admiringly imitated by lesser legal lights as was his gesture of bespectacling himself
This is most astounding my boy said he
It is mostmost Gratifying
suggested Norman with a sardonic grin
Not in the least Frederick
The very reverse the exact reverse
Norman gave a shrug that said Why do you persist in those fraudsand with ME
But he did not speak
I know pursued Lockyer that you would not have taken this step without conclusive reasons
And I shall not venture the impertinence of prying or of urging
Thanks said Norman drily
Now as to the terms of settlement
Lockyer from observation and from gossip had a pretty shrewd notion of the state of his young partners mind and drew the not unwarranted conclusion that he would be indifferent about termswould be easy
With the suavity of Mr GreatandGoodHeart he said My dear boy there cant be any question of money with us
Well do the generously fair thingfor were not hucksterers but gentlemen
That sounds terrifying observed the young man with a faint ironic smile
I feel my shirt going and the cold winds whistling about my bare body
To save time let ME state the terms
You want to be rid of me
I want to go
Its a whim with me
Its a necessity for you
Lockyer shifted uneasily at these evidences of unimpaired mentality and undaunted spirit
Here are my terms proceeded Norman
You are to pay me forty thousand a year for five years unless I open an office or join another firm
In that case payments are to cease from the date of my re entering practice
Lockyer leaned back and laughed benignantly
My dear Norman he said with a gently remonstrant shake of the head those terms are impossible
Forty thousand a year
Why that is within ten thousand of the present share of any of us but you
It is the income of nearly three quarters of a million at six per centof a million at four per cent
Very well said Norman settling back in his chair
Then I stand pat
Now my dear Norman permit me to propose terms that are fair to all When I said I stood pat I meant that I would stay on
His eyes laughed at Lockyer
I guess we can live without Burroughs and his dependents
Maybe they will find they cant live without us
He slowly leaned forward until with his forearms against the edge of his desk he was concentrating a memorable gaze upon Lockyer
Mr Lockyer said he I have been exercising my privilege as a free man to make a damn fool of myself
I shall continue to exercise it so long as I feel disposed that way
But let me tell you something
I can afford to do it
If a mans asset is money or character or position or relatives and friends or popular favor or any other perishable article he must take care how he trifles with it
He may find himself irretrievably ruined
But my asset happens to be none of those things
It is one that can be lost or damaged only by insanity or death
Do you follow me
The old man looked at him with the sincere and most flattering tribute of compelled admiration
What a mind youve got Frederickand what courage
You accept my terms
If the others agreeand I think they will
They will said Norman
The old man was regarding him with eyes that had genuine anxiety in them
Why DO you do it Fred
he said
Because I wish to be free replied Norman
He would never have told the full truth to that incredulous old cynic of a timeserverthe truth that he was resigning at the dictation of a pride which forbade him to involve others in the ruin he in his madness was bent upon
I dont mean why do you resign said Lockyer
I mean the otherthewoman
Norman laughed harshly
Ive seen too much of the world not to understand continued Lockyer
The measureless power of woman over manespeciallypardon me my dear Normanespecially a bad woman
The measureless power of a mans imagination over himself rejoined Norman
Did you ever see or hear of a man without imagination being upset by a woman
Its in here Mr Lockyerhe rapped his foreheadaltogether in here
You realize that
Yet you go onand for such a pardon me my boy for saying itfor such a trifling object
What does trifling mean sir
replied the young man
What is trifling and what is important
It depends upon the point of view
What I want that is vital
What I do not wantthat is paltry
Its my nature to go for what I happen to wantto go for it with all there is in me
I will take nothing elsenothing else
There was in his eyes the glitter called insanity the glitter that reflects the state of mind of any strong man when possessed of one of those fixed ideas that are the idiosyncrasy of the strong
It would have been impossible for Lockyer to be possessed in that way he had not the courage nor the concentration nor the inde pendence of soul like most men even able men he dealt only in the conventional
Not in his wildest youth could he have wrecked or injured himself for a woman women for him occupied their conventional place in the scheme of things and had no allure beyond the conventionally proper and the conventionally improper for be it remembered vice has its beaten track no less than virtue and most of the vicious are as tame and unimaginative as the plodders in the high roads of propriety
Still Lockyer had associated with strong men men of boundless desires thus he could in a measure sympathize with his young associate
What a pity that these splendid powers should be perverted from the ordinary desires of strong men
Norman rose to end the interview
My address is my house
They will forwardif I go away
Lockyer gave him a hearty handclasp made a few phrases about good wishes and the like left him alone
The general opinion was that Norman was done for
But Lockyer could not see it
He had seen too many men fall only to rise out of lowest depths to greater heights than they had fallen from
And Norman was only thirtyseven
Perhaps this would prove to be merely a dip in a securely brilliant career and not a fall at all
In that casewith such a brain such a genius for the lawlessness of the law what a laughing on the other side of the mouth there might yet be among young Normans enemiesand friends
He spent most of the next few daysthe lunch time the late afternoon finally the early morning hours lurking about the Equitable Building in which were the offices of Pytchley and Culver
As that building had entrances on four streets the best he could do was to walk round and round with an occasional excursion through the corridors and past the elevators
He had written her asking to see her he had got no answer
He ceased to wait at the elevators after he had twice narrowly escaped being seen by Tetlow
He was indifferent to Tetlow except as meeting him might make it harder to see Dorothy
He drank hard
But drink never affected him except to make him more grimly tenacious in whatever he had deliberately and soberly resolved
Drink did not explainneither wholly nor in any partthis conduct of his
It and the more erratic vagaries to follow will seem incredible conduct for a man of Normans character and position to feeble folk with their feeble desires their dread of criticism and ridicule their exaggerated and adoring notions of the master men
In fact it was the natural outcome of the mans naturearrogant contemptuous of his fellowmen and of their opinions and like all the master men capable of such concentration upon a desire that he would adopt any means high or low dignified or the reverse if only it promised to further his end
Fred Norman at these vulgar vigils took the measure of his own selfabasement to a hairs breadth
But he kept on with the fever of his infatuation burning like a delirium burning higher and deeper with each baffled day
At noon one day as he swung into Broadway from Cedar street he ran straight into Tetlow
It was raining and his umbrella caught in Tetlows
It was a ludicrous situation but there was no answering smile in his former friends eyes
Tetlow glowered
Ive heard you were hanging about he said
How low you have sunk
Norman laughed in his face
Poor Tetlow he said
I never expected to see you develop into a crusader
And what a Don Quixote you look
Cheer up old man
Dont take it so hard
I warn you to keep away from her said Tetlow in subdued tense tones his fat face quivering with emotion
Hasnt she shown you plainly that shell have nothing to do with you
I want only five minutes talk with her Tetlow said Norman dropping into an almost pleading tone
And I guarantee Ill say nothing you wouldnt approve if you heard
You are advising her badly
You are doing her an injury
I am protecting her from a scoundrel retorted Tetlow
Shell not thank you for it when she finds out the truth
You can write to her
What a shallow liar you are
I cannot write what I must say said Norman
It had never been difficult for him however provoked to keep his temperoutwardly
Tetlows insults were to him no more than the barkings of a watch dog and one not at all dangerous but only amusing
I must see her
If you are her friend and not merely a jealous disappointed lover youll advise her to see me
You shall not see her if I can help it cried his former friend
And if you persist in annoying her Dont make futile threats Tetlow Norman interrupted
Youve done me all the mischief you can do
I see you hate me for the injuries youve done me
Thats the way it always is
But I dont hate you
It was at my suggestion that the Lockyer firm is trying to get you back as a partner
Then as Tetlow colored Oh I see youre accepting their offer
If I had thought Nonsense
Youre not a fool
How does it matter whose the hand if only its a helping hand
And you may be sure theyd never have made you the offer if they didnt need you badly
All the credit I claim is having the intelligence to enlighten their stupidity with the right suggestion
In spite of himself Tetlow was falling under the spell of Normans personality of the old and deep admiration the lesser man had for the greater
Norman he said how can you be such a com bination of bigness and petty deviltry
You are a monster of selfindulgence
Its a Gods mercy there arent more men with your selfishness and your desires
Norman laughed sardonically
The difference between me and most men said he isnt in selfishness or in desires but in courage
Courage Billytheres what most of you lack
And even in courage Im not alone
My sort fill most of the high places
Tetlow looked dismal confession of a fear that Norman was right
Yes pursued Norman in this country there are enough wolves to attend to pretty nearly all the sheep though its amazing how much mutton there is
With an abrupt shift from raillery Youll help me with her Billy
Why dont you let her alone Fred
pleaded Tetlow
It isnt worthy of youa big man like you
Let her alone Fredthe poor child trying to earn her own living in an honest way
Let her alone
Tetlow I shall never let her alone as long as she and I are both alive
The fat man with his premature wrinkles and his solemn air of law books that look venerable though fresh from the press took on an added pastiness
Fredfor Gods sake cant you love her in a noble waya way worthy of you
Norman gave him a penetrating glance
Is love such love as mineAND yours There Tetlow flushed guiltilyis it ever noblewhatever that means
No its humanhuman
But Im not trying to harm her
I give you my word



Will you help meand her
Tetlow hesitated
His heavy cheeks quivered
I dont trust you he cried violentlythe violence of a man fighting against an enemy within
Dont ever speak to me again
And he rushed away through the rain knocking umbrellas this way and that
About noon two days later as Norman was making one of his excursions past the Equitable elevators he saw Bob Culver at the news stand
It so happened that as he recognized Culver Culver cast in the direction of the elevators the sort of look that betrays a man waiting for a woman
Unseen by Culver Norman stopped short
Into his face blazed the fury of suspicion jealousy and hateone of the cyclones of passion that swept him from time to time and revealed to his own appalled self the full intensity of his feeling the full power of the demon that possessed him
Culver was of those glossy black men who are beloved of women
He was much handsomer than Norman who indeed was not handsome at all but was regarded as handsome because he had the air of great distinction
Many times these two young men had been pitted against each other in legal battles
Every time Norman had won
Twice they had contended for the favor of the same lady
Each had scored once
But as Culvers victory was merely for a very light and emptyheaded lady of the stage while he had won Josephine Burroughs away from Culver the balance was certainly not against him
As Norman slipped back and into the cross corridor to avoid meeting Culver Dorothy Hallowell hurried from a just descended elevator and with a quick frightened glance toward Culver in profile almost ran toward Norman
It was evident that she had only one thought to escape being seen by her new employer
When she realized that some one was standing before her and moved to one side to pass she looked up
Oh
she gasped starting back
And then she stood there white and shaking
Is that beast Culver hounding you
demanded Norman
She recovered herself quickly
With flashing eyes she cried How dare you
How dare you
Norman possessed by his rage against Culver paid no attention
If he dont let you alone he said Ill thrash him into a hospital for six months
You must leave his office at once
Youll not go back there
You must be crazy replied she calm again
Ive no complaint to make of the way Im being treated
I never was so well off in my life
And Mr Culver is very kind and polite
You know what that means said Norman harshly
Everyone isnt like you retorted she
He was examining her from head to foot as if to make sure that it was she with no charm missing
He noted that she was much less poorly dressed than when she worked for his firm
In those days she often looked dowdy showed plainly the girl who has to make a hasty toilet in a small bedroom with tiny washstand and lookingglass in the early coldest hours of a cold morning
Now she looked well taken care of physically not so well not anything like so well as the women uptown the ladies with nothing to do but make toilettes still unusually well looked after for a working girl
At first glance after those famished and ravening days of longing for her and seeking her she before him in rather dim reality of the obvious officegirl seemed disappointing
It could not be that this insignificance was the cause of all his fever and turmoil
He began to hope that he was recovering that the cloud of insane desire was clearing from his sky
But a second glance killed that hope
For once more he saw her mystery her beauties that revealed their perfection and splendor only to the observant
While he looked she was regaining her balance as the fading color in her white skin and the subsidence of the excitement in her eyes evidenced
Let me pass please she said coldlyfor she was against the wall with him standing before her in such a way that she could not go until he moved aside
Well lunch together he said
I want to talk with you
Did that wellmeaning assTetlowtell you
There is nothing you can say that I wish to hear was her quiet reply
Your eyesthe edges of the lids are red
You have been crying
She lifted her glance to his and he had the sense of a veil drawing aside to reveal a desolation
For my father she said
His face flushed
He looked steadily at her
Now that he is gone you have no one to protect you
I am I need no one said she with a faintly contemptuous smile
You do need some oneand I am going to undertake it
Her face lighted up
He thought it was because of what he had said
But she immediately undeceived him
She said in a tone of delighted relief Here comes Mr Tetlow
You must excuse me
Dorothylisten
he cried
We are going to be married at once
The words exploded dizzily in his ears
He assumed they would have a far more powerful effect upon her
But her expression did not change
No she said hastily
I must go with Mr
Tetlow
Tetlow was now at hand his heavy face almost formidable in its dark ferocity
She said to him I was waiting for you
Come on Norman turned eagerly to his former friend
He said Tetlow I have just asked Miss Hallowell to be my wife
Tetlow stared
Then pain and despair seemed to flood and ravage his whole body
I told you the other day Norman went on that I was ready to do the fair thing
I have just been saying to Miss Hallowell that she must have some one to protect her
You agree with me dont you
Tetlow fumbling vaguely with his watch chain gazed straight ahead
Yes he said with an effort
Yes you are right Norman
An office is no place for an attractive girl as young as she is
Has Culver been annoying her
inquired Norman
Tetlow started
Ahshes told youhas she
I rather hoped she hadnt noticed or understood
Both men now looked at the girl
She had shrunk into herself until she was almost as dim and unimpressive as cipherlike as when Norman first beheld her
Also she seemed at least five years less than her twenty
Dorothy said Norman you will let me take care of youwont you
No she saidand the word carried all the quiet force she was somehow able to put into her short direct answers
Tetlows pasty sallowness took on a dark red tinge
He looked at her in surprise
You dont understand Miss Dorothy he said
He wants to marry you
I understand perfectly replied she with the far away look in her blue eyes
But Ill not marry him
I despise him
He frightens me
He sickens me
Norman clinched his hands and the muscles of his jaw in the effort to control himself
Dorothy he said Ive not acted as I should
Tetlow will tell you that there is good excuse for me
I know you dont understand about those thingsabout the ways of the world I understand perfectly she interrupted
Its you that dont understand
I never saw anyone so conceited
Havent I told you I dont love you and dont want anything to do with you
Tetlow lover though he wasor perhaps because he was lover of the hopeless kind that loves generously could not refrain from protest
The girl was flinging away a dazzling future
It wasnt fair to her to let her do it when if she appreciated she would be overwhelmed with joy and gratitude
I believe you ought to listen to Norman Miss Dorothy he said pleadingly
At any rate think it overdont answer right away
He is making you an honorable proposalone thats advantageous in every way Dorothy regarded him with innocent eyes wide and wondering
I didnt think you could talk like that Mr
Tetlow
she exclaimed
You heard what I said to himabout the way I felt
How could I be his wife
He tried everything elseand now though hes ashamed of it hes trying to get me by marriage
Oh I understand
I wish I didnt
Id not feel so low
She looked at Norman
Cant you realize EVER that I dont want any of the grand things youre so crazy aboutthat I want something very differentsomething you could never give meor get for me
Isnt there anything I can do Dorothy to make you forget and forgive
he cried like a boy an infatuated boy
For Gods sake Tetlow help me
Tell her Im not so rotten as she thinks
Ill be anything you like my darlingANYTHINGif only youll take me
For I must have you
Youre the only thing in the world I care forand without you Ive no interest in lifenonenone
He was so impassioned that passersby began to observe them curiously
Tetlow became uneasy
But Norman and Dorothy were unconscious of what was going on around them
The energy of his passion compelled her though the passion itself was unwelcome
Im sorry she said gently
Though you would have hurt me if you could I dont want to hurt you



Im sorry
I cant love you



Im sorry
Come on Mr
Tetlow
Norman stood aside
She and Tetlow went on out of the building
He remained in the same place oblivious of the crowd streaming by each man or woman with a glance at his vacant stare
XIV THAN Fred Norman no man ever had better reason to feel securely entrenched upon the heights of success
It was no silly vaunt of optimism for him to tell Lockyer that only loss of life or loss of mind could dislodge him
And a few days after Dorothy had extinguished the last spark of hope he got ready to pull himself together and show the world that it was indulging too soon in its hypocritical headshakings over his ruin
I am going to open an office of my own at once he said to his sister
She did not wish to discourage him but she could not altogether keep her thoughts from her face
She had in a general way a clear idea of the complete system of tollgates duly equipped with strong barriers which the mighty few have established across practically all the highroads to material success
Also she felt in her brothers manner and tone a certain profound discouragement a lack of the unconquerable spirit which had carried him so far so speedily
It is not a baseless notion that the man who has never been beaten is often destroyed by his first reverse
Ursula feared the spell of success had been broken for him
You mean she suggested with apparent carelessness that you will give up your forty thousand a year
He made a disdainful gesture
I can make more than that said he
Its a second rate lawyer who cant in this day
Of course you can replied she tactfully
But why not take a rest first
Then theres old Burroughs on the war path
Wouldnt it be wise to wait till he calms down
If Burroughs or any other man is necessary to me rejoined Fred the sooner I find it out the better
I ought to know just where II myselfstand
No one is necessary to you but yourself said Ursula proudly and sincerely
But Fred Are you yourself just now
No Im not admitted he
But the way to become so again isnt by waiting but by working
An expression of sheer wretchedness came into his listless heavy eyes
Urse Ive got to conquer my weakness now or go under
She was eager to hold on to the secure forty thousand a yearfor his sake no less than for her own
She argued with him with all the adroitness of a mind as good in its way as his own
But she could not shake his resolution
And she in prudence desisted when he said bitterly I see youve lost confidence in me
Well I dont blame you



So have I
Then after a moment violently rather than strongly But Ive got to get it back
If I dont Im only putting off the smasha complete smash
I dont see quite how its to be arranged said she red and hesitating
For she feared he would think her altogether selfish in her anxiety
He certainly would have been justified in so thinking he knew how rarely generosity survived in the woman who leads the soft and idle life
How long can we keep on as were living now if theres nothing or little coming in
I dont know confessed she
She was as poor at finance as he and had certainly not been improved by his habit of giving her whatever she happened to think was necessary
I cant say
Perhaps a few months I dont know Not long Im afraid
Six months
Oh no
You seethe fact isIve been rather careless about the bills
Youre so generous Fred and one is so busy in New York
I guess we owe a good dealhere and there and yonder
Andthe last few days some of the tradespeople have been pressing for payment
You see
exclaimed he
The report is going round that Im ruined and done for
Ive simply got to make good
If you cant keep up a front shut up the house and go abroad
You can stay till Ive got my foot back on its neck
She believed in him at bottom
She could not conceive how appearances and her forebodings could be true
Such strength as his could not be overwhelmed thus suddenly
And by so slight a thingby an unsatisfied passion for a woman and an insignificant woman at that
For like all women like all the world for that matter she measured a passion by the woman who was the object of it instead of by the man who fabricated it
YesIll go abroad said she hopefully
Quietly arrange for a long stay he advised
I HOPE it wont be long
But I never plan on hope
Thus with his sister and Fitzhugh out of the way and the heaviest of his burdens of expense greatly lightened he set about rehabitating himself
He took an office waited for clients
And clients cameexcellent clients
Came and precipitately left him
There were two reasons for it
The firstthe one most often heardwas the story going round that he had been and probably still was out of his mind
No deadlier or crueler weapon can be used against a man than that same charge as to his sanity
It has been known to destroy or seriously maim brilliant and able men with no trace of any of the untrustworthy kinds of insanity
Where the mans own conduct gives color to the report the attack is usually mortal
And Norman had acted the crazy man
The second reason was the hostility of Burroughs reinforced by all the hatreds and jealousies Normans not too respectful way of dealing with his fellow men had been creating through fifteen years
The worst moment in the life of a man who has always proudly regarded himself as above any need whatever from his fellow men is when he discovers all in a flash that the timid animal he spurned as it fawned has him upon his back has its teeth and claws at his helpless throat
For four months he stood out against the isolation the suspicion as to his sanity the patronizing pity of men who but a little while before had felt honored when he spoke to them
For four months he gave battle to unseen and silent foes compassing him on every side
He had no spirit for the fight his love of Dorothy Hallowell and his complete rout there had taken the spirit out of himand with it had gone that confidence in himself and in his luck which had won him so many critical battles
Then He had been keeping up a large suite of offices a staff of clerks and stenographers and all the paraphernalia of the great and successful lawyer
He had been spreading out the little business he got in a not unsuccessful effort to make it appear big and growing
He now gave up these offices and the costly pride pomp and circumstanceleft with several thousand dollars owing
He took two small rooms in a building tenanted by beginners and cheap shysters
He continued to live at his club where even the servants were subtly insolent to him he could see the time approaching when he might have to let himself be dropped for failing to pay dues and bills
He stared at his ruin in stupid and dazed amazement
Usually to hear or to read about such a catastrophe as this is to get a vague rather impressive notion of something picturesque and romantic
Ruined like all the big fateful words has a dignified sound
But the historians and novelists and poets and other keepers of human records have a pleasant but not very honest way of omitting practically all the essentials from their records and substituting glittering imaginings that delight the readerand wofully mislead him as to the truth about life
What wonder that we learn slowlyand improve slowly
How wofully we have been and are misled by all upon whom we have relied as teachers
Already one of these charming tales of majestic downfall was in process of manufacture with Frederick Norman as the central figure
It was only awaiting his suicide or some other mode of complete submergence for its final glose of glamor
In this manufacture the truth as usual had been almost omitted such truth as was retained for this artistic version of a human happening was so perverted that it was falser than the simon pure fictions with which it was interwoven
Just as the literal truth about his success was far from being altogether to his credit so the literal truth as to his fall gave him little of the vesture of the hero and that little ill fitting to cover his naked humanness
Let him who has risen to material success altogether by methods approved by the idealists let him who has fallen from on high with graceful majesty without hysterical clutchings and desperate attempts at self salvation in disregard of the safety of otherslet either of these superhuman beings come forward with the first stone for Norman
Those at some distance from the falling man could afford to be romantic and piteous over his fate
Those in his dangerous neighborhood were too busy getting out of the way
Man fallingstand from under
was the cryhow familiar it isand acquaintances and friends fled in mad skedaddle
He would surely be asking favorswould be trying to borrow money
It is no peculiarity of rats to desert a sinking ship it is simply an inevitable precaution in a social system modeled as yet upon natures cruel law of the survival of the fittest
A falling man is first of all a warning to all other men high enough up to be able to falla warning to them to take care lest they fall also where footing is so insecure and precipices and steeps beset every path
Norman falling falling gazed round him and up and down in dazed wonder
He had seen many others fall
He had seen just where and just why they missed their footing
And he had been confident that with him no such misstep was possible
He could not believe a little while and luck would turn and up he would go againhigher than before
Many a lawyerto look no farther than his own professionhad through recklessness or pride or inadvertence got the big men down on him
But after a time they had relented or had found an exact use for him and fall had been succeeded by rise
Was there a single instance where a man of good brain had been permanently downed
No not one
Stay Some of these unfortunates had failed to reappear on the heights of success
Yes thinking of the matter he recalled several such
Had he been altogether right in assuming in his days of confidence and success that they stayed down because they belonged down
Perhaps he had judged them harshly
Yes he was sure he had judged them harshly
There was such a thing as breaking a proud spiritand he found within himself apparent proof that precisely this calamity had befallen him
There came a timeand it came soonwhen he had about exhausted his desperate ingenuity at cornering acquaintances and former friends and sticking them up for loans of five hundred a hundred fifty twenty five Because these vulgar and repulsive facts are not found in the usual records of the men who have dropped and come up again do not imagine that only the hopeless and neverreappearing failures pass through such experiences
On the contrary they are part of the common human lot and few indeed are the men who have not had themand worseif they could but be brought to tell the truth
Destiny rarely permits any one of us to go from cradle to grave without doing many a thing shameful and universally condemned
How could it be otherwise under our social system
When Norman was about at the end of all his resources Tetlow called on himTetlow now a partner in the Lockyer firm
He came with an air of stealth
I dont want anyone to know Im doing this said he frankly
If it got out Id be damaged and youd not profit
Rarely does anyone however unworthyand Fred Norman was far from unworthy as we humans go rarely does anyone find himself absolutely without a friend
There is a saying that no man ever sunk so low ever became so vile and squalid in soul and body but that if he were dying and the fact were noised throughout the world some woman somewhere would comeperhaps from a sense of duty perhaps from love perhaps for the sake of a moment of happiness long past but never equaled and so never forgotten but from whatever motive she would come
In the same manner anyone in dire straits can be sure of some friend
There were several others whom Norman had been expectingmen he had saved by his legal ingenuity at turning points in their careers
None of these was so imprudent as uselessly to involve himself
It was Tetlow who cameTetlow with whom his accounts were more than balanced with the balance against him
Tetlow whom he did not expect
Norman did not welcome him effusively
He said at once How isshe
Tetlow shifted uneasily
I dont know
Shes not with us
I gave her a place thereto get her away from Culver
But she didnt stay long
No doubt shes doing well
I thought you cared about her said Norman who in estimating Tetlows passion had measured it by his own had neglected to consider that the desires of most men soon grow short of breath and weary of leg
Yesso I did care for her said Tetlow in the voice of a man who has been ill but is now well
But thats all over
Women arent worth bothering about much
Theyre largely vanity
The way they soon take a man for granted if hes at all kind to them discourages any but the poorest sort of fool
At least thats my opinion
Then you dont come from her
said Norman with complete loss of interest in his caller
No
Ive come Fred I hear youre in difficulties
Normans now deepset eyes gleamed humorously in his haggard and failedlooking face
IN difficulties
Not at all
Im UNDER themdrowned forty fathoms deep
Then youll not resent my coming straight to the point and asking if I can help you
Thats a rash offer Tetlow
I never suspected rashness was one of your qualities
I dont mean to offer you a loan or anything of that sort pursued Tetlow
Theres only one thing that can help a man in your position
He must either be saved outright or left to drown
Ive come with something that may save you
There was so much of the incongruous in a situation where HE was listening to an offer of salvation from such a man as Billy Tetlow that Norman smiled
Well what is it
he said
Theres a chance that within six months or so perhaps soonerBurroughs and Galloway may end their truce and declare war on each other
If so Galloway will win
Anyhow the Galloway connection would be better than the Burroughs connection
Norman looked at Tetlow shrewdly
How do you know this
he asked
Tetlows eyes shifted
Cant tell you
But I know
Galloway hates me
Tetlow nodded
You were the one who forced him into a position where he had to make peace with Burroughs
But Galloways a big man big enough to admire ability wherever he sees it
He has admired you ever since
And has given his business to another firm
But if the break comes hell need you
And hes the sort of man who doesnt hesitate to take what he needs
Too remote said Norman and his despondent gesture showed how quickly hope had lighted up
Besides Billy Ive lost my nerve
Im no good
But youve gotten over thatthat attack of insanity
Norman shook his head
I cant understand it ejaculated Tetlow
Of course you cant said Norman
But there it is
You havent seen her lately
Not since that day 


Billy she hasnt Norman stopped and Tetlow saw that his hands were trembling with agitation and marveled
Oh no replied Tetlow
So far as I know shes still respectable
Butwhy dont you go to see her
I think youd be cured
Why do you say that
demanded Norman the veins in his forehead bulging with the fury he was ready to release
For no especial reasonon my honor Fred replied Tetlow
Simply because time works wonders in all sorts of ways including infatuations
Also well the fact is it didnt seem to me that young lady improved on acquaintance
Maybe I got tired or piquedI dont know
If she hadnt been a silly little fool would she have refused you
I know it sounds wellin a novel or a playfor a poor girl to refuse a good offer just from sentiment
But all the same only a fool girl does itin lifeeh
But go to see her
Youll understand what I mean I think
I want you to brace up
That may help
Whats she doing
I dont know
Ill send you her address
I can get it
About Galloway If that break comes I propose that we get his businessyou and I I want you for a partner
I always did
I think I know how to get work out of you
I understand you better than anyone else
Thats why Im here
Its useless said Norman
Im willing to take the risk
Now heres what I propose
Ill stake you to the extent of a thousand dollars a month for the next six months you to keep on as you are and not to tie yourself up to any other lawyer or to any client likely to hamper us if we get the Galloway business
Ive been borrowing right and left I know about that interrupted Tetlow
Im not interested
If youll agree to my proposal Ill take my chances
You are throwing away six thousand dollars
I owe you a position where I make five times that much
Norman shrugged his shoulders
Very well
Can I have five hundred at once
Ill send you a check today
Ill send two checks a monththe first and the fifteenth
I am drinking a great deal
You always did
Not until recently
I never knew what drinking meant until these last few months
Well do as you like with the money
Drink it all if you please
Im making no conditions beyond the two I stated
You will send me that address
In the letter with the check
Will she see me do you think
I havent an idea replied Tetlow
Whats the mystery
asked Norman
Why do you speak of her so indifferently
Its the way I feel
Then in answer to the unspoken suspicion once more appearing in Normans eyes he added Shes a very nice sweet girl Norman so far as I know or believe
Beyond that Go to see her
It had been many a week since Norman had heard a friendly voice
The very sound of the human voice had become hateful to him because he was constantly detecting the note of nervousness the scarcely concealed fear of being entangled in his misfortunes
As Tetlow rose to go Norman tried to detain him
The sound of an unconstrained voice the sight of a believing face that did not express one or more of the shadings of contempt between pity and aversionthe sight and sound of this friend Tetlow was acting upon him like one of those secret unexpected powerful tonics which nature at times suddenly injects into a dying man to confound the doctors and cheat death
Tetlow said he Im downprobably down for good
But if I ever get up again Ill not make one mistakethe one that cost me this fall
Do you know what that mistake was
I suppose you mean Miss Hallowell
No said Norman to his surprise
I mean my lack of money of capital of a large and secure income
I used to imagine that brains were the best the only sure asset
I was guilty of the stupidity of overvaluing my own possessions
Brains are a mighty good asset Fred
Yesand necessary
But a man of action must have under his brains another assetMUST have it Billy
The one secure asset is a big capital
Money rules this world
Some men have been lucky enough to rise and stay risen without money
But not a man of all the men who have been knocked out could have been dislodged if he had been armed and armored with money
My prodigality was my fatal mistake
I shant make it againif I get the chance
You dont know Tetlow how hard it is to get money when you are tumbling and must have it
I never dreamed what a factor it is in calamities of EVERY sort
Its THE factor
I dont like to hear you talk that way Norman said Tetlow earnestly
Ive always most admired in you the fact that you werent mercenary
And I never shall be said Norman with the patient smile of a swift keen mind at one that is slow and hard to make understand
It isnt my nature
But if Im resurrected Ill seem to be mercenary until I get a full suit of the only armor thats invulnerable in this world
Why I built my fort like a fool
It was impregnable except for one thingone obvious thing
It hadnt a supply of water
If I build again itll be round a springan income big enough for my needs and beyond anybodys power to cut off
Tetlow showed that he was much cheered by Normans revived interest in life
But he went away uneasy for the last thing Norman said to him was Dont forget that address
XV BUT it chanced that Norman met her in the street about an hour after Tetlows call
He was on the way to lunch at the Lawyers Club one of those apparent luxuries that are the dire and pitiful necessities of men in New York fighting to maintain the semblance and the reputation of prosperity
It must not be imagined by those who are here let into Normans inmost secrets that his appearance betrayed the depth to which he had fallen
At least to the casual eye he seemed the same rich and powerful personage
An expert might have got at a good part of the truth from his somber eyes and haggard face from the subtle transformation of the former look of serene pride into the bravado of pretense
And as in a general way the facts of his fall were known far and wide all his acquaintances understood that his seeming of undiminished success was simply the familiar bluff
Its advantage to him with them lay in its raising a doubt as to just what degree of disaster it hidno small advantage
Nor was this bluff altogether for the benefit of the outside world
It made his fall less hideously intolerable to himself
In the bottom of his heart he knew that when drink and no money should finally force him to release his relaxing hold upon his fashionable clubs upon luxurious attire and habits he would suddenly and with accelerated speed drop into the abyss We have all caught glimpses of that abyssfrayed fine linen cheaply laundered a tie of one time smartness showing signs of too long wear a suit from the best kind of tailor with shiny spot glistening here patch peeping there a queer unkemptness about the hair and skinthese the beginnings of a road that leads straight and short to the barrelhouse the park bench and the police station
Because when a man strikes into that stretch of the road to perdition he ceases to be one of our friends passes from view entirely we have the habit of SAYING that such things rarely if ever happen
But we KNOW better
Manys the man now high who has had the sort of drop Norman was taking
We remember when he was making a bluff such as Norman was making in those days but we think now that we were mistaken in having suspected it of being bluff
Norman dressed with more than ordinary care how sensitive a man becomes about those things when there is neither rustle nor jingle in his pockets and his smallest check would be returned with the big black stamp No Funds Norman groomed to the last button was in Broadway near Rector Street
Ahead of him he saw the figure of a girla trim attractive figure slim and charmingly long of line
A second glance and he recognized her
What was the change that had prevented his recognizing her at once
He had not seen that particular lightishblue dress before nor the coquettish harmonizing hat
But that was not the reason
No it was the coquetry in her toilet the effort of the girl to draw attention to her charms by such small devices as are within the reach of extremely modest means
He did not like this change
It offended his taste it alarmed his jealousy
He quickened his step and when almost at her side spoke her nameMiss Hallowell
She stopped turned
As soon as she recognized him there came into her quiet lovely face a delightful smile
He could not conceal his amazement
She was glad to see him
Instantly following the invariable habit of an experienced analytical mind he wondered for what unflattering reason this young woman who did not like him was no longer showing it was seeming more than a little pleased to see him
Why how dye do Mr
Norman
said she
And her friendliness and assurance of manner jarred upon him
There was not a suggestion of forwardness but he used to her old time extreme reserve felt precisely as if she were bold and gaudy after the fashion of so many of the working girls who were popular with the men
This unfavorable impression disappearedor rather retired to the backgroundeven as it became definite
And once more he was seeing the charms of physical loveliness of physicaland moral and mental mystery that had a weird power over him
As they shook hands a quiver shot through him as at the shock of a terrific stimulant and he stood there longing to take her in his arms to feel the delicate yet perfect and vividly vital life of that fascinating form longing to kiss that sensitive slightly pouted rosy mouth to try to make those clear eyes grow soft and dreamy She was saying Ive been wondering what had become of you
I saw Tetlow he said
He promised to send me your address
At Tetlows name she frowned slightly then a gleam of ridicule flitted into her eyes
Oh that silly squeamish old maid
How sick I got of him
Norman winced and his jealousy stirred
Why
he asked
Always warning me against everybody
Always giving me advice
It was too tiresome
And at last he began to criticize methe way I dressedthe way I talkedsaid I was getting too free in my manner
The impudence of him
Norman tried to smile
Hed have liked me to stay a silly little mouse forever
So youve beenblossoming out
said Norman
In a quiet way replied she with a smile of self content so lovely as a smile that no one would have minded its frank egotism
There isnt much chance for fununless a girl goes too far
But at the same time I dont intend life to be Sunday when it isnt work
I got very cross with himMr Tetlow I mean
And I took another position
It didnt pay quite so well only fifteen a week
But I couldnt stand being watchedand guyed by all the other girls and boys for it
Where are you working
With an old lawyer named Branscombe
Its awful slow as Im the only one and hes old and does everything in an oldfashioned way
But the hours are easy and I dont have to get down till ninewhich is nice when youve been out at a dance the night before
Norman kept his eyes down to hide from her the legion of devils of jealousy
You HAVE changed he said
Im growing up replied she with a charming toss of her small headwhat beautiful effects the sunlight made in among those wavy strands and strays
And youre as lovely as everlovelier he said and his eyes were the eyes of the slave she had spurned
She did not spurn him nowand it inflamed his jealousy that she did not
She said Oh whats the good of looks
The towns full of pretty girls
And so many of them have moneywhich I havent
To make a hit in New York a girls got to have both looks and dress
But I must be going
Ive an engagement to lunch She gave a proud little smileat the Astor House
Its nice upstairs there
With Bob Culver
She laughed
I havent seen him since I left his office
You know Mr Tetlow took me with himback to your old firm
I didnt like Mr Culver
I dont care for those black men
They are badtempered and twofaced
Anyhow Id not have anything to do with a man who wanted to slip round with me as if he were ashamed of me
She was looking at Norman pleasantly enough
He wasnt sure that the hit was for him as well as for Culver but he flushed deeply
Will you lunch with me at the Astor House at one tomorrow
Ive got an engagement said she
And I must be going
Im awfully late
He had an instinct that her engagement on both days was with the same man
Im glad to have seen you Wont you let me call on you
he said imploringly but with the suggestion that he had no hope of being permitted to come
Certainly responded she with friendly promptness
She opened the shopping bag swinging on her arm
Here is one of my cards
When
This evening
Her laugh showed the beautiful deep pink and daz zling white behind her lips
NoIm going to a party
Let me take you
She shook her head
You wouldnt like it
Only young people
But Im not so old
She looked at him critically
Noyoure not
It always puzzled me
You arent oldyou look like a boy lots of the time
But you always SEEM old to me
Ill try to do better
Tonight
Not tonight laughed she
Lets seeto morrows Sunday
Come tomorrowabout half past two
Thank you he said so gratefully that he cursed himself for his folly as he heard his voicethe idiotic folly of so plainly betraying his feelings
No wonder she despised him
Beginning againand beginning wrong
Goodby
Her eyes her smile flashed and he was alone watching her slender grace glide through the throngs of lower Broadway
At his office again at three he found a note from Tetlow inclosing another of Dorothys cards and also the promised check
Into his face came the look that always comes into the faces of the prisoners of despair when the bolts slide back and the heavy door swings and hope stands on the threshold instead of the famil iar grim figure of the jailer
This looks like the turn of the road he muttered
Yes a turn it certainly wasbut was it THE turn
Ill know more as to that said he with a glance at the clock about this time tomorrow
It was a boarding house on the west side
And when the slovenly smelly maid said Go right up to her room he knew it wasprobably respectable but not rigidly respectable
However working girls must receive and they cannot afford parlors and chaperons
Still It was no place for a lovely young girl full of charm and of love of lifeand not brought up in the class where the women are trained from babyhood to protect themselves
He ascended two flights knocked at the door to the rear
Come
called a voice and he entered
It was a small neat room arranged comfortably and with some taste
He recognized at first glance many little things from her room in the Jersey City housethings he had provided for her
On the chimney piece was a large photograph of her fatherNormans eyes hastily shifted from that
The bed was folded away into a couchfor space and for respectability
At first he did not see her
But when he advanced a step farther she was disclosed in the doorway of a deep closet that contained a stationary washstand
He had never seen her when she was not fully dressed
He was now seeing her in a kind of wrapper of pale blue clean but not fresh
It was open at the throat its sleeves fell away from her arms
And to cap the climax of his agitation her hair her wonderful hair was flowing loosely about her face and shoulders
Whats the matter with you
she cried laughingly
Her eyes sparkled and danced the waves of her hair each hair standing out as if it were alive sparkled and danced
It was a smile never to be forgotten
Why are you so embarrassed
He was embarrassed
He was thrilled
He was enragedenraged because if she would thus receive him whom she did not like she would certainly thus receive any man
I dont mind you she went on mockingly
Id have to be careful if it was one of the boys
Do you receive theboyshere
demanded he glumly his voice arrogant with the possessive rights a man feels when he cares for a woman whether she cares for him or not
Why not
scoffed she
Where else would I see them
I dont make street corner dates thank you
Youre as bad as fat foolish Mr
Tetlow
I beg your pardon said he humbly
She straightway relented saying Of course Id not let one of the boys come up when I was dressed like this
But I didnt mind YOU
He winced at this amiable unconscious reminder of her always exasperating and tantalizing and humiliating indifference to him And as Im going to a grand dance tonight I simply had to wash my hair
Does that satisfy you Mr
Primmey
He hid the torment of his reopened wound and seated himself at the center table
She returned to a chair in the window where the full force of the afternoon sun would concentrate upon her hair
And he gazed spell bound
He had always known that her hair was fine
He had never dreamed it was like this
It was thick it was fine and soft
In color as the sunbeams streamed upon it it was all the shades of gold and all the other beautiful shades between brown and red
It fell about her face about her neck about her shoulders in a gorgeous veil
And her pure white skin It was an even more wonderful white below the line of her collar where he had never seen it before
Such exquisitely modeled earssuch a delicate noseand the curve of her cheeksand the glory of her eyes
He clinched his teeth and his hands sat dumb with his gaze down
How do you like my room
she chattered on
Its not so badreally quite comfortablethough Im afraid Ill be cold when the weather changes
But its the best I can do
As it is I dont see how Im going to make ends meet
I pay twelve of my fifteen for this room and two meals
The rest goes for lunch and car fare
As soon as I have to get clothes She broke off laughing
Well he said what then
Im sure I dont know replied she carelessly
Perhaps old Mr Branscombell give me a raise
Still eighteen or twenty is the most I could hope forand that wouldnt mean enough for clothes
She shook her head vigorously and her hair stood out yet more vividly and the sunbeams seemed to go mad with joy as they danced over and under and through it
He had ventured to glance up again he hastily looked down
You spoiled me she went on
Those few months over there in Jersey City
It made SUCH a change in me though I didnt realize it at the time
You see I hadnt known since I was a tiny little girl what it was to live really decently and so I was able to get along quite contentedly
I didnt know any better
She made a wry face
How I loathe the canned and cold storage stuff I have to eat nowadays
And how I do miss the beautiful room I had in that big house over there
and how I miss Molly and Patand the gardenand doing as I pleasedand the clothes I had I thought I was being careful and not spoiling myself
You may not believe it but I was really conscientious about spending money
She laughed in a queer absent way
I had such a funny idea of what I had a right to do and what I hadnt
And I didnt spend so very much on outandout luxury
But enough to spoil me for this life
As Norman listened as he notedin her appearance manner way of talkingthe many meaning signs of the girl hesitating at the fork of the roadshe felt within him the twinges of fear of jealousyand through fear and jealousy the twinges of conscience
She was telling the truth
He had undermined her ability to live in purity the life to which her earning power assigned her



WHY had she been so friendly to him
Why had she received him in this informal almost if not quite inviting fashion
So you think Ive changed
she was saying
WellI have
Gracious what a little fool I was
His eyes lifted with an agonized question in them
She flushed glanced away glanced at him again with the old sweet expression of childlike innocence which had so often made him wonder whether it was merely a mannerism or was a trick or was indeed a beam from a pure soul
Im foolish stillin certain ways she said significantly
And you always intend to be
suggested he with a forced smile
Ohyes replied shepositively enough yet it somehow had not the full force of her simple short statements in the former days
He believed her
Perhaps because he wished to believe must believe would have been driven quite mad by disbelief
Still he believed
As yet she was good
But it would not last much longer
With himor with some other
If with him then certainly afterward with anotherwith others
No matter how jealously he might guard her she would go that road if once she entered it
If he would have her for his very own he must strengthen her not weaken her must keep her foolish stillin certain ways
He said Theres nothing in the other sort of life
Thats what they say replied she with ominous irritation
Stillsome girlsLOTS of girls seem to get on mighty well without being so terribly particular
You ought to see them after a few years
Im only twentyone laughed she
Ive got lots of time before Im old



You haventmarried
No said he
I thought Id have heard if you had
She laughed queerlyagain shook out her hair and it shimmered round her face and over her head and out from her shoulders like flames
Youve got a kind of aMr Tetlow way of talking
It doesnt remind me of you as you were in Jersey City
She said nothing she suggested nothing that had the least impropriety in it or faintest hint of impropriety
It was nothing positive nothing aggressive but a certain vague negative something that gave him the impression of innocence still innocent but looking or trying to look tolerantly where it should not
And he felt dizzy and sick stricken with shame and remorse and jealous fear
Yesshe was sliding slowly gently unconsciously down to the depth in which he had been lying sick and shudderingno to deeper depthsto the depths where there is no light no trace of a return path
And he had started her down
He had done it when he in his pride and selfishness had ignored what the success of his project would mean for her
But he knew now in bitterness and shame and degradation he had learned
I was infamous
he said to himself
She began to talk in a low embarrassed voice Sometimes I think of getting married
Theres a young mana young lawyerhe makes twentyfive a week but itll be years and years before he has a good living
A man doesnt get on fast in New York unless he has pull
Norman roused from his remorse blazed inside
You are in love with him
She laughed and he could not tell whether it was to tease him or to evade
Youd not care about him long said Norman unless there were more money coming in than hed be likely to get soon
Love without money doesnt go at least not in New York
Do you suppose I dont know that
said she with the irritation of one faced by a hateful fact
StillI dont see what to do
Norman biting his lip and fuming and observing her with jealous eyes said in the best voice he could command How long have you been in love with him
Did I say I was in love
mocked she
You didnt say you werent
Who is he
If youll stay on about half an hour or so youll see him
Noyou cant
Ive got to get dressed before I let him up
He has very strict ideaswhere Im concerned
Then why did you let ME come up
Norman said with a penetrating glance
She lowered her gaze and a faint flush stole into her cheeks
Was it confession of the purpose he suspected
Or was it merely embarrassment
I heard of a case once continued Norman his gaze significantly direct the case of a girl who was in love with a poor young fellow
She wanted money luxury
Also she wanted the poor young fellow
The color flamed into the girls face then left it pale
Her white fingers fluttered with nervous grace into her masses of hair and back to her lap again to rest there in timid quiet
She knew another man pursued Norman one who was able to give her what she wanted in the way of comfort
So she decided to make an arrangement with the man and keep it hidden from her loverand in that way get along pleasantly until her lover was in better circumstances 
Her gaze was upon her hands listless in her lap
He felt that he had spoken her unspoken probably unformed thoughts
Yes unformed
Men and women especially women habitually pursued these unacknowledged andeven unformed purposes in their conflicts of the desire to get what they wanted and their desire to appear well to themselves
What would you think of an arrangement like that
asked he determined to draw her secret heart into the open where he could see where she could see
She lifted frank guileless eyes to his
I suppose the girl was trying to do the best she could
What do you think of a girl whod do that
I dont judge anybodyany more
Ive found out that this world isnt at all as I thoughtas I was taught
Would YOU do it
She smiled faintly
No she replied uncertainly
Then she restored his wavering belief in her essential honesty and truthfulness by adding That is to say I dont think I would
She busied herself with her hair feeling it to see whether it was not yet dry spreading it out
He looked at her unseeingly
At last she said You must go
Ive got to get dressed
YesI must be going said he absently rising and reaching for his hat on the center table
She stood up put out her hand
Im glad you came
Thank you said he still in the same abstraction
He shook hands with her moved hesitatingly toward the door
With his hand on the knob he turned and glanced keenly at her
He surprised in her face a look of mystery of seriousness of sadnesswas there anxiety in it also
And then he saw a certain elusive reminder of her fatherand it brought to him with curious force the memory of how she had been brought up of what must be hers by inheritance and by trainingshe the daughter of a great and simple and noble man Youll come again
she said and there was the note in her voice that made his nerves grow tense and vibrate
But he seemed not to have heard her question
Still at the unopened door he folded his arms upon his chest and said speaking rapidly yet with the deliberation of one who has thought out his words in advance I dont know what kind of girl you are
I never have known
Ive never wanted to know
If you told me you werewhat is called good Id doubt it
If you told me you werent Id want to kill you and myself
They say theres a fatal woman for every man and a fatal man for every woman
I always laughed at the ideauntil you
I dont know what to make of myself
She suddenly laid her finger on her lips
It irritated him to discover that as he talked speaking the things that came from the very depths of his soul she had been giving him only part of her attention had been listening for a step on the stairs
He was hearing the ascending step now
He frowned
Cant you send him away
he asked
I must said she in a low tone
It wouldnt do for him to know you were here
He has strict ideas and is terribly jealous
A few seconds of silence then a knock on the other side of the door
Whos there
she called
Im a little early came in an agreeable young mans voice
Arent you ready
Not nearly replied she in a laughing innocent voice
Youll have to go away for half an hour
Ill wait out here on the steps
Her eyes were sparkling
A delicate color had mounted to her skin
Norman watching her jealously clinched his strong jaws
She said Noyou must go clear away
I dont want to feel that Im being hurried
Dont come back until a quarter past four
All right
Im crazy to see you
This in the voice of a lover
She smiled radiantly at Norman as if she thought he would share in her happiness at these evidences of her being well loved
The unseen young man said Exactly a quarter past
What time does your clock say it is now
A quarter to replied she
Thats what my watch says
So therell be no mistake
For half an hourgoodby
Half an hour
she called
She and Norman stood in silence until the footsteps died away
Then she said crossly to Norman You ought to have gone before
I dont like to do these things
You do them well said he with a savage gleam
She was prompt and sure with his punishment
She said simply and sweetly Id do anything to keep HIS good opinion of me
Norman felt and looked cowed
You dont know how it makes me suffer to see you fond of another man he cried
She seemed not in the least interested went to the mirror of the bureau and began to inspect her hair with a view to doing it up
You can go in five minutes said she
By that time hell be well out of the way
Anyhow if he saw you leaving the house hed not know but what you had been to see some one else
He knows you by reputation but not by sight
Norman went to her took her by the shoulders gently but strongly
Look at me he said
She looked at him with an expression or perhaps absence of expression that was simple listening
If you meant awhile ago some such thing as I hintedI will have nothing to do with it
You must marry meor its nothing at all
Her gaze did not wander but before his wondering eyes she seemed to fade fade toward colorlessness insig nificance
The light died from her eyes the flush of health from her white skin the freshness from her lips the sparkle and vitality from her hair
A slow gradual transformation which he watched with a frightened tightening at the heart
She said slowly YouwantmetoMARRY you
Ive always wanted it though I didnt realize replied he
How else could I be sure of you
Besides He flushed added hurriedly almost in an undertone I owe it to you
She seated herself deliberately
After he had waited in vain for her to speak he went on If you married me I know youd play square
I could trust you absolutely
I dont knowcant find out much about youbut at least I know that
But I dont love you said she
You neednt remind me of it rejoined he curtly
I dont think soso poorly of you as I used to she went on
I understand a lot of things better than I did
But I dont love you and I feel that I never could
Ill risk that said Norman
Through his clinched teeth Ive got to risk it
Id be marrying you because I dont feel able to to make my own way
Thats the reason most girls have for marrying said he
Love comes afterwardif it comes
And its the more likely to come for the girl not having faked the man and herself beforehand
She glanced at the clock
He frowned
She started up
You MUST go she said
What is your answer
Oh I couldnt decide so quickly
I must think
You mean you must see your young man again see whether there isnt some way of working it out with him
That too replied she simply
Butits nearly four oclock Ill come back at seven for my answer
No Ill write you tonight
I must know at once
This suspense has got to end
It unfits me for everything
IllIll decidetonight she said with a queer catch in her voice
Youll get the letter in the morning mail
Very well
And he gave her his club address
She opened the door in her impatience to be rid of him
He went with a hasty Goodby which she echoed as she closed the door
When he left the house he saw standing on the curb before it a tall goodlooking young manwith a frank amiable face
He hesitated glowering at the young mans profile
Then he went his way suffocating with jealous anger depressed despondent fit for nothing but to drink and to brood in fatuous futility
XVI UNTIL very recently indeed psychology was not an ology at all but an indefinite something or other up in the air the sport of the winds and fogs of transcendental tommy rot
Now however science has drawn it down has fitted it in its proper place as a branch of physiology
And we are beginning to have a clearer understanding of the thoughts and the thoughtproducing actions of ourselves and our fellow beings
Soon it will be no longer possible for the historian and the novelist the dramatist the poet the painter or sculptor to present in all seriousness as instances of sane human conduct the aberrations resulting from various forms of disease ranging from indigestion in its mild temper breeding forms to acute homicidal or suicidal mania
In that day of greater enlightenment a large body of now much esteemed art will become ridiculous
Practically all the literature of strenuous passion will go by the board or will be relegated to the medical library where it belongs and it and the annals of violence found in the daily newspapers of our remote time will be cited as documentary proof of the low economic and hygienic conditions prevailing in that almost barbarous period
For certain it is that the human animal when healthy and well fed is invariably peaceable and kindly and tolerantup to the limits of selfishness and even encroaching upon those limits
Of writing rubbish about love and passion there is no endand will be no end until the venerable traditional nonsense about those interesting emotions shares the fate that should overtake all the cobwebs of ignorance thickly clogging the windows and walls of the human mind
Of all the fiddlefaddle concerning passion probably none is more shudderingly admired than the notion that one possessed of an overwhelming desire for another longs to destroy that other
It is true there is a form of murderous mania that involves practically all the emotions including of course the passionswhich are as readily subject to derangement as any other part of the human organism
But passion in itselfeven when it is so powerful that it dominates the whole life as in the case of Frederick Normanpassion in itself is not a form of mental derangement in the medical sense
And it does not produce acute selfishness paranoiac egotism but a generous and beautiful kind of unselfishness
Not from the first moment of Fred Normans possession did he wish to injure or in any way to make unhappy the girl he loved
He longed to be happy with her to have her happy with and through him
He represented his plotting to himself as a plan to make her happier than she ever had been as for ultimate consequences he refused to consider them
The most hardened rake when passion possesses him wishes all happiness to the woman of his pursuit
Indifference coldnessthe natural hardheartedness of the normal manreturns only when the inspiration and elevation of passion disappear in satiety
The man or the woman who continues to inspire passion continues to inspire tenderness and considerateness
So when Norman left Dorothy that Sunday afternoon he being a normal if sore beset human being was soon in the throes of an agonized remorse
There may have been some hypocrisy in it some struggling to cover up the baser elements in his infatuation for her
What human emotion of upward tendency has not at least a little of the varnish of hypocrisy on certain less presentable spots in it
But in the main it was a creditable a manly remorse and not altogether the writhings of jealousy and jealous fear of losing her
He saw clearly that she was telling the truth and telling it too gently when she said he was responsible for her having standards of living which she could not unaided hope to attain
It is a dreadful thing to interfere in the destiny of a fellow being
We do it all the time we do it lightly
Nevertheless it is a dreadful thingnot one that ought not to be done but one that ought to be done only under imperative compulsion and then with every precaution
He had interfered in Dorothy Hallowells destiny
He had lifted her out of the dim obscure niche where she was ensconced in comparative contentment
He had lifted her up where she had seen and felt the pleasures of a life of luxury
But for me he said to himself she would now be marrying this poor young lawyer or some chap of the same sort and would be looking forward to a life of happiness in a little flat or suburban cottage
If she should refuse his offerwhat then
Clearly he ought to do his best to help her to happiness with the other man
He smiled cynically at the moral height to which his logic thus pointed the way
Nevertheless he did not turn away but surveyed itand there formed in his mind an impulse to make an effort to attempt that height if Fate should rule against him with her
If I were a really decent man thought he Id sit down now and write her that I would not marry her but would give her young man a friendly hand in the law if she wished to marry him
But he knew that such utter generosity was far beyond him
Only a hero could do it said he he added with what a sentimentalist might have called a return of his normal cynicism only a hero who really in the bottom of his heart didnt especially want the girl
And a candid person of experience might possibly admit that there was more truth than cynicism in his look askance at the grand army of martyrs of renunciation most of whom have simply given up something they didnt really want
If she accepts me Ill make it impossible for her not to be happy he said to himself in all the fine unselfishness of passionnot divine unselfishness but humannot the kind we read about and pretend to have and get a savage attack of bruised vanity if we are accused of not having itno but just the kind we have and show in our daily livesthe unselfishness of longing to make happy those whom it would make us happier to see happy
She may think she cares for this young clerk so ran his thoughtsbut she doesnt know her own mind
When she is mine Ill take her in hand as a gardener does a delicate rare flower and by Heaven how I shall make her blossom and bloom
It would hardly be possible for a human being to pass a stormier night than was that night of his
Alternations between hope and despairfantastic pictures of future with and without her wild pleadings with herthose delirious transports to which our imaginations give way if we happen to be blessed and cursed with imaginationsin the security of the darkness and aloneness of night and bed
And through it all he was tormented body and soul by her lovelinessher hair her skin her eyes the shy slender graces of her form He tossed about until his bed was so wildly disheveled that he had to rise and remake it
When day came and the first mail there was her letter on the salver of the boy entering the room
He reached for it with eager trembling arm drew back
Put it on the table he said
The boy left
He was alone
Leaning upon his elbow in the bed he stared at the letter with hollow terrified eyes
It contained his destiny
If she accepted he would go up for his soul sickness would be cured
If she refused he would cease to struggle
He rose took from a locked drawer a bottle of rye whisky
He poured a tall glassthe kind called a bar glasshalf full drank it straight down without a pause or a quiver
The shock brought him up standing
He looked and acted like his former self as he went to the table took the letter opened it and read I am willing to marry you if you really want me
I am so tired of struggling and I dont see anything but dark aheadD
H Norman struggled over to the bed threw himself down flat upon his back arms and legs extended wide and whole body relaxed
He felt the blood whirl up into his brain like the great red and black tongues of flame and smoke in a conflagration and then he slept soundly until nearly one oclock
To an outsider there would have been a world of homely commonplace pathos in that little letter of the girls if read aright that is to say if read with what was between the lines supplied
It is impossible to live in cities any length of time and with any sort of eyes without learning the bitter unromantic truths about povertycity poverty
In quiet desolate places one may be poor very poor without much conscious suffering
There are no teasing contrasts no torturing temptations
But in a city if one knows anything at all of the possibilities of civilized life of the joys and comforts of good food clothing and shelter of theater and concert and excursion of entertaining and being entertained poverty becomes a hell
In the country in the quiet towns the innocent people wonder at the greediness of the more comfortable kinds of city people at their love of money their incessant dwelling upon it their reverence for those who have it their panic like flight from those who have it not
They wonder how folk apparently human can be so inhuman
Let them be careful how they judge
If you discover any human being anywhere acting as you think a human being should not investigate all the circumstances look thoroughly into all the causes of his or her conduct before you condemn him or her as inhuman unworthy of your kinship and your sympathy
In her brief letter the girl showed that young though she was and not widely experienced in life she yet had seen the horrors of city poverty how it poisons and kills all the fine emotions
She had seen many a loving young couple start out confidently with a few hundred dollars of debt for furniturehad seen the love fade and wither shrivel diehad seen appear peevishness and hatred and unfaithfulness and all the huge foul weeds that choke the flowers of married life
She knew what her lovers salary would buyand what it would not buyfor two
She could imagine their fate if there should be three or more
She showed frankly her selfishness of renunciation
But there could be read between the linesconcealed instead of vauntedperhaps unsuspectedher unselfishness of renunciation for the sake of her lover and for the sake of the child or the children that might be
In our love of moral sham and glitter we overlook the real beauties of human morality we even are so dim or vulgar sighted that we do not see them when they are shown to us
As Norman awakened he reached for the telephone said to the boy in charge of the club exchange Look in the book find the number of a lawyer named Branscombe and connect me with his office
After some confusion and delay he got the right office but Dorothy was out at lunch
He left a message that she was to call him up at the club as soon as she came in
He was shaving when the bell rang
He was at the receiver in a bound
Is it you
he said
Yes came in her quiet small voice
Will you resign down there today
Will you marry me this afternoon
A brief silence thenYes
Thus it came about that they met at the City Hall license bureau got their license and half an hour later were married at the house of a minister in East Thirty third Street within a block of the Subway station
He was feverish gay looked years younger than his thirty seven
She was quiet dim passive neither grave nor gay but going through her part without hesitation with much the same patient plodding expression she habitually bore as she sat working at her machineas if she did not quite understand but was doing her best and hoped to get through not so badly
Ive had nothing to eat said he as they came out of the parsonage
Nor I said she
Well go to Delmonicos said he and hailed a passing taxi
On the way he sitting in one corner explained to her shrunk into the other corner I can confess now that I married you under false pretenses
I am not prosperous as I used to be
To be brief and plain Im down and out professionally
She did not move
Apparently she did not change expression
Yet he speaking half banteringly felt some frightful catastrophe within her
You are poor
she said in her usual quiet way
WE are poor corrected he
I have at present only a thousand dollars a montha little more but not enough to talk about
She did not move or change expression
Yet he felt that her heart her blood were going on again
Are youangry
he asked
A thousand dollars a month seems an awful lot of money to me she said
Its nothingnothing to what well soon have
Trust me
And back into his eyes flashed their former look
Ive been sick
Im well again
I shall get what I want
If you want anything youve only to ask for it
Ill get it
I know how



I dont prey myselfIve no fancy for the brutal sports
But I teach lions how to prey and I make them pay for the lessons
He laughed with an effervescing of young vitality and selfconfidence that made him look handsome and powerful
In the future theyll have to pay still higher prices
She was looking at him with weary wondering pathetic eyes that gazed from the pallor of her dead white face mysteriously
What are you thinking
he asked
I was listening replied she
Doesnt it make you happywhat you are going to have
No replied she
But it makes me content
With eyes suddenly suffused he took her handso gently
Dorothy he said you will try to love me
Ill try said she
Youll be kind to me
I couldnt be anything else he cried
And in a gust of passion he caught her to his breast and kissed her triumphantly
I love youand youre minemine
She released herself with the faint insistent push that seemed weak but always accomplished its purpose
Her lip was trembling
You said youd be kind she murmured
He gazed at her with a baffled expression
OhI understand he said
And I shall be kind
But I must teach you to love me
Her trembling lip steadied
You must be careful or you may teach me to hate you said she
He studied her in a puzzled way laughed
What a mystery you are
he cried with raillery
Are you child or are you woman
No matter
We shall be happy
The taxicab was swinging to the curb
In the restaurant he ordered an enormous meal
And he ate enormously and drank in due proportion
She ate and drank a good deal herselfa good deal for her
And the results were soon apparent in a return of the spirits that are normal to twentyone years regardless of what may be lurking in the heart in a dark corner to come forth and torment when there is nothing to distract the attention
We shall have to live quietly for a while said he
Of course you must have clothesat once
Ill take you shopping tomorrow
He laughed grimly
Just at present we can get only what we pay cash for
Still you wont need much
Later on Ill take you over to Paris
Does that attract you
Her eyes shone
How soon
she asked
I can tell you in a week or ten days
He became abstracted for a moment
I cant understand how I let them get me down so easilythat is I cant understand it now
I suppose its just the difference between being weak with illness and strong with health
His eyes concentrated on her
Is it really you
he cried gaily
And are you really mine
No wonder I feel strong
It was always that way with me
I never could leave a thing until I had conquered it
She gave him a sweet smile
Im not worth all the trouble you seem to have taken about me said she
He laughed for he knew the intense vanity so pleasantly hidden beneath her shy and modest exterior
On the contrary said he goodhumoredly you in your heart think yourself worth any amount of trouble
Its a habit we men have got you women into
And you One of the many things that fascinate me in you is your supreme selfcontrol
If the king were to come down from his throne and fall at your feet youd take it as a matter of course
She gazed away dreamily
And he understood that her indifference to matters of rank and wealth and power was not wholly vanity but was in part at least due to a feeling that love was the only essential
Nor did he wonder how she was reconciling this belief of high and pure sentiment with what she was doing in marrying him
He knew that human beings are not consistent cannot be so in a universe that compels them to face directly opposite conditions often in the same moment
But just as all lines are parallel in infinity so all actions are profoundly consistent when referred to the infinitely broad standard of the necessity that every living thing shall look primarily to its own well being
Disobedience to this fundamental carries with it inevitable punishment of disintegration and death and those catastrophes are serious matters when one has but the single chance at life that will be repeated never again in all the eternities
After their late lunch or early dinner they drove to her lodgings
He went up with her and helped her to packnot a long process as she had few belongings
He noted that the stockings and underclothes she took from the bureau drawers were in anything but good condition that the half dozen dresses she took from the closet and folded on the couch were about done for
Presently she said cheerfully and with no trace of false shame You see Im pretty nearly in rags
Oh thats soon arranged replied he
Why bother to take these things
Why not give them to the maid
She debated with herself
I think youre right she decided
Yes Ill give them to Jennie
The underclothes too he urged
And the hats
It ended in her having left barely enough loosely to fill the bottom of a small trunk with two trays
They drove to the Knickerbocker Hotel and he took a small suite one of the smallest and least luxurious in the house for with all his desire to make her feel the contrast of her change of circumstances sharply he could not forget how limited his income was and how unwise it would be to have to move in a few days to humbler quarters
He hoped that the rooms englamoured by the hotels general air of costly luxury would sufficiently impress her
And while she gave no strong indication but accepted everything in her wonted quiet passive manner he was shrewd enough to see that she was content
Tomorrow he said to himself after she has done some shopping the last regret will leave her and her memory of that clerk will begin to fade fast
Ill give her too much else to think about
The following morning when they faced each other at breakfast in their sitting room he glanced at her from time to time in wonder and terror
She looked not merely insignificant but positively homely
Her skin had a sickly pallor her hair seemed to be of many different and disagreeable shades of uninteresting dead yellow
Her eyes suggested faded blue china dishes with colorless lashes and reddened edges of the lids
Her lips had lost their rosy freshness her teeth their sparkling whiteness
His heavy heart seemed to be resting nauseously upon the pit of his stomach
Was his infatuation sheer delusion with no basis of charm in her at all
Was she indeed nothing but this unattractive faded little commonplacenessa poor specimen of an inferior order of working girl
What an awakening
And she was his WIFEwas his companion for the yet more brilliant career he had resolved and was planning
He must introduce her everywhere must see the not to be concealed amazement in the faces of his acquaintances must feel the cruel covert laughter and jeering at his weak folly
Was there ever in history or romance a parallel to such fatuity as his
Why people would be right in thinking him a sham a mere bluffer at the high and strong qualities he was reputed to have
Had Norman been in fact the man of ice and iron the compulsions of a career under the social system made him seem the homely girl opposite him that morning would speedily have had something to think about other than her unhappiness of the woman who has given her person to one man and her heart to another
Instead the few words he addressed to her were all gentleness and forbearance
Stronger than his chagrin was his pity for herthe poor unconscious victim of his mad hallu cination
If she thought about the matter at all she assumed that he was still the slave of her charmsfor the florid enthusiasm of mans passion inevitably deludes the woman into fancying it objective instead of wholly subjective and only the rare very wise woman after much experience learns to be suspicious of the validity of her own charms and to concentrate upon keeping up the mans delusions
At last he rose and kissed her on the brow and let his hand rest gently on her shoulderwhat a difference between those caresses and the caresses that had made her beg him to be kind to her
Said he Do you mind if I leave you alone for a while
I ought to go to the club and have the rest of my things packed and sent
Ill not be gone longabout an hour
Very well said she lifelessly
Ill telephone my office that Ill not be down today
With an effort she said Theres no reason for doing that
I dont want to interfere with your business
Im neglecting nothing
And that shopping must be done
She made no reply but went to the window and from the height looked down and out upon the mighty spread of the city
He observed her a moment with a dazed pitying expression took his hat and departed
It was nearly two hours before he got together suffi cient courage to return
He had been hopinghad been saying to himself with vigorous effort at confidence that he had simply seen one more of the many transformations each of which seemed to present her as a wholly different personality
When he should see her again she would have wiped out the personality that had shocked and saddened him would appear as some new variety of enchantress perhaps even more potent over his senses than ever before
But a glance as he entered demolished that hope
She was no different than when he left
Evidently she had been crying and spasms of that sort always accentuate every unloveliness
He did not try to nerve himself to kiss her but said Itll not take you long to get ready
She moved to rise from her languid rest upon the sofa
She sank back
Perhaps wed better not go today suggested she
Dont you feel well
he asked and his tone was more sympathetic than it would have been had his sympathy been genuine
Not very replied she with a faint deprecating smile
And not verynot very Not very what
he said in a tone of encouragement
Not very happy she confessed
Im afraid Ive made aa dreadful mistake
He looked at her in silence
She could have said nothing that would have caused a livelier response within himself
His cynicism noted the fact that while he had mercifully concealed his discontent she was thinking only of herself
But he did not blame her
It was only the familiar habit of the sex bred of mans assiduous cultivation of its egotism
He said Oh youll feel differently about it later
Lets get some fresh air and see what the shops have to offer
A pause then she timidly Would you mind very much if Iif I didntgo on
You mean if you left me
She nodded without looking at him
He could not understand himself but as he sat observing her so young so inexperienced and so undesirable a pity of which he would not have dreamed his nature capable welled up in him choking his throat with sobs he could scarcely restrain and filling his eyes with tears he had secretly to wipe away
And he felt himself seized of a sense of responsibility for her as strong in its solemn still way as any of the paroxysms of his passion had been
He said My dearyou mustnt decide anything so important to you in a hurry
A tremor passed over her and he thought she was going to dissolve in hysterics
But she exhibited once more that marvelous and mysterious selfcontrol whose secret had interested and baffled him
She said in her dim quiet way It seems to me I just cant stay on
You can always go you know
Why not try it a few days
He could feel the trend of her thoughts and in the way things often amuse us without in the least moving us to wish to laugh he was amused by noting that she was trying to bring herself to stay on out of consideration for HIS feelings
He said with a kind of paternal tenderness Whenever you want to go I am willing to arrange things for youso that you neednt worry about money
But I feel that as I am older than you I ought to do all I can to keep you from making a mistake you might soon regret
She studied him dubiously
He saw that she naturally enoughdid not believe in his disinterestedness that she hadnt a suspicion of his change or rather collapse of feeling
She said If you ask it Ill stay a while
But you must promise toto be kind to me
There was only gentleness in his smile
But what a depth of satirical selfmockery and amusement at her innocent young egotism it concealed
Youll never have reason to speak of that again my dear said he
Icantrust you
she said
Absolutely replied he
Ill have another room opened into this suite
Would you like that
If youif you dont mind
He stood up with sudden boyish buoyance
Now lets go shopping
Lets amuse ourselves
She rose with alacrity
She eyed him uncertainly then flung her arms round his neck and kissed him
You are SO good to me
she cried
And Im not a bit nice
He did not try to detain her but sent her to finish dressing with an encouraging pat on the shoulder and a cheerful Dont worry about yourselfor me
XVII ABOUT half an hour later the door into the bedroom opened and she appeared on the threshold of the sitting room ready for the street
He stared at her in the dazed amazement of a man faced by the impossible and uncertain whether it is sight or reason that is tricking him
She had gone into the bedroom not only homely but commonplace not only commonplace but common a dingy washedout blonde girl whom it would be a humiliation to present as his wife
She was standing there in the majesty of such proud pale beauty as poets delight to ascribe to a sorrowful princess
Her wonderful skin was clear and translucent giving her an ethereal look
Her hair reminded him again of what marvels he had seen in the sunlight of Sunday afternoon
And looking at her form and the small head so gracefully capping it he could think only of the simile that had always come to him in his moments of ecstasythe lily on its tall stem
And once more like a torrent the old infatuation sprang from its dried sources and came rushing and overwhelming through vein and nerve
Am I mad nowwas I mad a few moments agois it she or is it my own disordered senses
She was drawing on her gloves was unconscious of his confusion
He controlled himself and said You have a most disconcerting way of changing your appearance
She glanced down at her costume
No its the same dress
Ive only the one you know
He longed to take her in his arms but could not trust himself
And this wondergirl his very own was talking of leaving him
And henot an hour before he apparently in his right senses had been tolerating such preposterous talk
Give her up
Never
He must see to it that the subject did not find excuse for intruding again
I have frightened herhave disgusted her
I must restrain myself
I must be patient and teach her slowlyand win her gradually
They spent an interesting and even exciting afternoon driving from shop to shop and selecting the first beginnings of her wardrobe
He had only about three hundred dollars
Some of the things they ordered were ready for delivery and so had to be paid for at once
When they returned to the hotel he had but fifty dollars leftand had contracted debts that made it necessary for him to raise at least a thousand dollars within a week
He saw that his freedom with sums of money which terrified her filled her with awe and admirationand that he was already more successful than he had expected to be in increasing her hesitation about leaving him
Among the things they had bought were a simple black chiffon dress and a big plumed black hat to match
These needed no alterations and were delivered soon after they returned
Some silk stockings came also and a pair of slippers bought for the dinner toilet
You can dress tonight said he and Ill take you to Sherrys and to the theater afterwards
She was delighted
At last she was going to look like the women of whom she had been dreaming these last few months
She set about dressing herself he waiting in the sitting room in a state of acute nervousness
What would be the effect of such a toilet
Would she look like a ladyor likewhat she had suggested that morning
She was so changeable had such a wide range of variability that he dared not hope
When she finally appeared he was ready to fall down and worship
He was about to take her where his world would see her where every inch of her would be subjected to the cruelest most hostile criticism
One glance at her and he knew a triumph awaited him
No man and no woman would wonder that he had lost his head over such beauty as hers
Hat and dress seemed just what had been needed to bring out the full glory of her charms
You are incredibly beautiful he said in an awed tone
I am proud of you
A little color came into her cheeks
She looked at herself in the mirror with her quiet intense secret yet not covert vanity
He laughed in boyish pleasure
This is only the small beginning said he
Wait a few months
At dinner and in a box at the theater afterwards he had the most exquisite pleasure of his life
She had been seen by many of his former friends and he was certain they knew who she was
He felt that he would have no difficulty in putting her in the place his wife should occupy
A woman with such beauty as hers was a sensation one fashionable society would not deny itself
She had good manners an admirable manner
With a little coaching she would be as much at home in grandeur as were those who had always had it
The last fear of losing her left him
On the way back to the hotel he in a delirium of pride and passion crushed her in his arms and caressed her with the frenzy that had always terrified her
She resisted only faintly was almost passive
She is mine
he said to himself exultantly
She is really mine
When he awoke in the morning she was still asleep looked like a tired lovely child
Several times while he was dressing he went in to feast his eyes upon her beauty
How could he possibly have thought her homely in whatever moment of less beauty or charm she might have had
The crowning charm of infinite variety
She had a delightfully sweet disposition
He was not sure how much or how little intelligence she hadprobably more than most women
But what did that matter
It would be impossible ever to grow weary or to be anything but infatuated lover when she had such changeful beauty
He kissed her lightly on her thick braids as he was about to go
He left a note explaining that he did not wish to disturb her and that it was necessary for him to be at the office earlier
And that morning in all New York no man left his home for the days struggle for dollars with a freer or happier heart or readier to play the game boldly skillfully with success
Certainly he needed all his courage and all his skill
To most of the people who live in New York and elsewhere throughout the countryor the world for that matteran income of a thousand dollars a month seems extremely comfortable to say the least of it
The average American family of five has to scrape along on about half that sum a year
But among the comfortable classes in New Yorkand perhaps in one or two other citiesa thousand dollars a month is literally genteel poverty
To people accustomed to what is called luxury nowadayspeople with the habit of the private carriage the private automobile and several servantsto such people a thousand dollars a month is an absurd little sum
It would not pay for the food alone
It would not buy for a man and his wife with no children clothing enough to enable them to make a decent appearance
Norman living alone and living very quietly indeed might have got along for a while on that sum if he had taken much thought about expenditures had persisted in such severe economies as using street cars instead of taxicabs and drinking whisky at dinner instead of his customary quart of sixdollar champagne
Norman the married man could not escape disaster for a single month on an income so pitiful
Probably on the morning on which he set out for downtown in search of money enough to enable him to live decently not less than ten thousand men on Manhattan Island left comfortable or luxurious homes faced with precisely the same problem
And each and every one of them knew that on that day or some day soon they must find the money demanded imperiously by their own and their families tastes and necessities or be ruined flung out trampled upon derided as failures hated by the loved ones they had caused to be humiliated
And every man of that legion had a fine an unusually fine brainresourceful incessant teeming with schemes for wresting from those who had dollars the dollars they dared not go home without
And those ten thousand quickest and most energetic brains by their mode of thought and action determined the thought and action of the entire countrygave the mercenary and unscrupulous cast to the whole social system
Themselves the victims of conditions they were the bellwethers to millions of victims compelled to follow their leadership
Norman by the roundabout mode of communication he and Tetlow had established summoned his friend and backer to his office
Tetlow he began straight off Ive got to have more money
How much
said Tetlow
More than you can afford to advance me
How much
repeated Tetlow
Three thousand a month right awayat the least
Thats a big sum said Tetlow
Yes for a man used to dealing in small figures
But in reality its a moderate income
Few large families spend more
Few large or small families in my part of New York pinch along on so little
What has happened to you
said Tetlow dropping into a chair and folding his fat hands on his stomach
Why
asked Norman
Its in your voicein your facein your cool demand for a big income
Lets start right old man said Norman
Dont CALL thirtysix thousand a year big or youll THINK it big
And if you think it big you will stay little
Tetlow nodded
Im ready to grow said he
Now whats happened to you
Ive got married replied Norman
I thought so
To MissHallowell
To Miss Hallowell
So my ways clear and Im going to resume the march
Yes
Ive two plans
Either will serve
The first is yoursthe one you partly revealed to me the other day
Partly
said Tetlow
Partly repeated Norman laughing
I know you Billy and that means I know youre absolutely incapable of plotting as big a scheme as you suggested to me
It came either from Galloway or from some one of his clique
I said all Im at liberty to say Fred
I dont wish you to break your promise
All I want to know is can I get the three thousand a month and assurance of its lasting and leading to something bigger
What is your other scheme
said Tetlow and it was plain to the shrewder young lawyer that the less shrewd young lawyer wished to gain time
Simple and sure replied Norman
We will buy ten shares of Universal Fuel Company through a dummy and bring suit to dissolve it
I looked into the matter for Burroughs once when he was after the Fosdick Langdon group
Universal Fuel wouldnt dare defend the action I could bring
We could get what we pleased for our ten shares to let up on the suit
The moment their lawyers saw the papers Id draw theyd advise it
Tetlow shook his large impressively molded head
Shady said he
Shady
Norman smiled with goodnatured patience
You sound like Burroughs or Galloway when they are denouncing a man for trying to get rich by the same methods they pursued
My dear Bill dont be one of those lawyers who will do the queer work for a client but not for themselves
Theres no sense no morality no intelligent hypocrisy even in that
We didnt create the commercial morality of the present day
For Gods sake lets not be of the poor fools who practice it but get none of its benefits
Tetlow shifted uneasily
I dont like to hear that sort of thing said he apologetic and nervous
Is it true
Yes
Butdamn it I dont like to hear it
That is to say youre willing to pay the price of remaining small and obscure just for the pleasure of indulging in a wretched hypocrisy of a selfdeception
Bill come out of the small class
Whether you go in with me or not come out of the class of understrappers
Whats the difference between the big men and their little followers
Why the big men SEE
They dont deceive themselves with the cant they pour out for the benefit of the ignorant mob
Tetlow was listening like a pupil to a teacher
That was always his attitude toward Norman
The big men continued Norman know that canting is necessarythat one must always profess high and disinterested motives and so on and so on
But they dont let their hypocritical talk influence their actions
How is it with the little fellows
Why they believe the flapdoodle the leaders talk
They go into the enterprise do all the small dirty work lie and cheat and steal and hand over the proceeds to the big fellows for the sake of a pat on the back and a noisy Honest fellow
Here are a few crumbs for you
And crumbs are all that a weak silly hypocritical fool deserves
Can you deny it
No doubt youre right Fred conceded Tetlow
But Im afraid I havent the nerve
Come in behind me
Ive got nerve for two NOW
At that triumphant now Tetlow looked curiously at his friend
Yes IT has changed youchanged you back to what you were
I dont understand
It isnt necessary that you understand rejoined Norman
Do you think you could really carry through that scheme youve just outlined
I see it fascinates you
Ive no objection to rising to the class of big men said Tetlow
But arent you letting your confidence in yourself deceive you
Did I ever let it deceive me
No confessed Tetlow
Ive often watched you and thought youd fall through it or stumble at least
But you never did
And shall I tell you why
Because I use my self confidence and my hopefulness and all my optimistic qualities only to create an atmosphere of success
But when it comes to planning a move of any kind when I assemble my lieutenants round the council board in my brain I never permit a single cheerful one to speak or even to enter
Its a serious gloomy circle of faces Bill
Tetlow nodded reminiscently
Yes you always were like that Fred
And the one who does the most talking at my council is the gloomiest of all
Hes Lieutenant Flaw picker
He cant see any hope for anything
He sees all the possibilities of failure
He sees all the chances against success
And whats the result
Why when the council rises it has taken out of the plan every chance of mishap that my intelligence could foresee and it has provided not one but several safe lines of orderly retreat in case success proves impossible
Tetlow gazed at Norman in worshipful admiration
What a brain
What a mind
he ejaculated
And to think that YOU could be upset by a WOMAN
Norman leaned back in his chair smiling broadly
Not by a woman he corrected
By a girlan inexperienced girl of twenty
It seems incredible
A grain of dust dropped into a watch movement in just the right placeyou know what happens
Tetlow nodded
Then with a sharp anxious look But its all over
Norman hesitated
I believe so he said
Tetlow rose and rubbed his thighs
He had been sitting long in the same position and he was now stout enough to suffer from fat mans cramp
Well said he we neednt bother about that Universal Fuel scheme at present
I can guarantee you the three thousand dollars and the other things
Norman shook his head
Not enough he said
You want more money
No
But I will not work or rather wait in the dark
Tell your principals that I must be let in
Tetlow hesitated walking about the office
Finally he said Look here Fredyou think I deceived you the other dayposed as your friend when in reality I was simply acting as agent for people who wanted you
Norman gave Tetlow a look that made him redden with pleasure
No I dont old man said he
I know you recommended meand that they were shy of me because of the way Ive been actingand that you stood sponsor for me
Isnt that right
Something like that admitted Tetlow
But they were eager to get you
It was only a question of trusting you
I was able to do you a good turn there
And Ill make a rich man and a famous one of you said Norman
Yes
I believe you will cried Tetlow tears in his prominent studious eyes
Ill see those people in a day or two and let you know
Do you need money right away
Of course you do
And down he sat and drew a check for fifteen hundred dollars
Norman laughed as he glanced to see if it was correctly drawn
Id not have dared return to my bride with empty pockets
Thats what it means to live in New York
Tetlow grinned
A sentimental town isnt it
Especially the women
Oh I dont blame them said Norman
They need the money and the only way theyve got of making it is out of sentiment
And you must admit they give a bully good quality if the payment is all right
Tetlow shrugged his shoulders
Im glad I dont need them said he
It gives me the creeps to see them gliding about with their beautiful dresses and their sweet soft faces
He and Norman lunched together in an outofthe way restaurant
After a busy and a happy afternoon Norman returned early to the hotel
He had cashed his check
He was in funds
He would give her another and more thrilling taste of the joy that was to be hers through himand soon she would be giving even as she gotfor he would teach her not to fear love not to shrink from it but to rejoice in it and to let it permeate and complete all her charms
He ascended to the apartment and knocked
There was no answer
He searched in vain for a chamber maid to let him in
He descended to the office
Oh Mr Norman said one of the clerks
Your wife left this note for you
Norman took it
She went out
About three oclockwith a young gentleman who called on her
They came back a while ago and she left the note
Thank you said Norman
He took his key went up to the apartment
Not until he had closed and locked the door did he open the note
He read Last night you broke your promise
So I am going away
Dont look for me
It wont be any use
When I decide what to do Ill send you word
He was standing at the table
He tossed the note on the marble threw open the bedroom door
The black chiffon dress the big plumed hat and all the other articles they had bought were spread upon the bed arranged with the obvious intention that he should see at a glance she had taken nothing away with her
Hell
he said aloud
Why didnt I let her go yesterday morning
XVIII A FEW days later Tetlow having business with Norman tried to reach him by telephone
After several failures he went to the hotel and in the bar learned enough to enable him to guess that Norman was of on a mad carouse
He had no difficulty in finding the trail or in following it the difficulty lay in catching up for Norman was going fast
Not until late at nightthat is early in the morningof the sixth day from the beginning of his search did he get his man
He was prepared to find a wreck haggard wildly nervous and disreputably disheveled for so far as he could ascertain Norman had not been to bed but had gone on and on from one crowd of revelers to another in a city where it is easy to find companions in dissipation at any hour of the twentyfour
Tetlow was even calculating upon having to put off their business many weeks while the crazy man was pulling through delirium tremens or some other form of brain fever
An astonishing sight met his eyes in the Third Avenue oyster house before which the touring car Norman had been using was drawn up
At a long table eating oysters as fast as the opener could work sat Norman and his friend Gaskill a fellow member of the Federal Club and about a score of broken and battered tramps
The supper or breakfast was going forward in admirable order
Gaskill whom Norman had picked up a few hours before showed signs of having done some drinking
But not Norman
It is true his clothing might have looked fresher but hardly the man himself
Just in time
he cried out genially at sight of Tetlow
Sit down with us
Waiter a chair next to mine
Gentlemen Mr Tetlow
Mr Tetlow gentlemen
Whatll you have old man
Tetlow declined champagne accepted half a dozen of the huge oysters
Ive been after you for nearly a week said he to Norman
Pity you werent WITH me said Norman
Ive been getting acquainted with large numbers of my fellow citizens
From the Bowery to Yonkers
Exactly
Dont fall asleep Gaskill
But Gaskill was snoring with his head on the back of his chair and his throat presented as if for the as of the executioner
Hes all in said Tetlow
Thats the way it goes complained Norman
I cant find anyone to keep me company
Tetlow laughed
You look as if you had just started out said he
Tell meWHERE have you slept
I havent had time to sleep as yet
I dropped in to suggest that a little sleep wouldnt do any harm
Not quite yet
Watch our friends eat
It gives me an appetite
Waiter another dozen all roundand some more of this carbonated white wine youve labeled champagne
As he called out this order a grunt of satisfaction ran round the row of human derelicts
Tetlow shuddered yet was moved and thrilled too as he glanced from face to facethose hideous hairy countenances begrimed and beslimed each countenance expressing in its own repulsive way the one emotion of gratified longing for food and drink
Where did you get em
inquired he
From the benches in Madison Square replied Norman
He laughed queerly
Recognize yourself in any of those mugs Tetlow
he asked
Tetlow shivered
I should say not
he exclaimed
Normans eyes gleamed
I see myself in all of em said he
Poor wretches
muttered Tetlow
Pity wasted he rejoined
You might feel sorry for a man on the way to where theyve got
But once arrivedas well pity a dead man sleeping quietly in his box with three feet of solid earth between him and worries of every kind
Shake this crowd said Tetlow impatiently
I want to talk with you
All right if it bores you
He sent the waiter out for enough lodginghouse tickets to provide for all
He distributed them himself to make sure that the proprietor of the restaurant did not attempt to graft
Then he roused Gaskill and bundled him into the car and sent it away to his address
The tramps gathered round and gave Norman three cheersthey pressed close while four of them tried to pick his and Tetlows pockets
Norman knocked them away good naturedly and he and Tetlow climbed into Tetlows hansom
To my place suggested Tetlow
No to minethe Knickerbocker replied Norman
Id rather you went to my place first said Tetlow uneasily
My wife isnt with me
She has left me said Norman calmly
Tetlow hesitated extremely nervous finally acquiesced
They drove a while in silence then Norman said Whats the business
Galloway wants to see you
Tell him to come to my office tomorrowthat means todayat any time after eleven
But that gives you no chance to pull yourself together objected Tetlow
Normans face seen in the light of the street lamp they happened to be passing showed ironic amusement
Never mind about me Billy
Tell him to come
Tetlow cleared his throat nervously
Dont you think old man that youd better go to see him
Ill arrange the appointment
Norman said quietly Tetlow Ive dropped pretty far
But not so far that I go to my clients
The rule of calls is that the man seeking the favor goes to the man who can grant it
But it isnt the custom nowadays for a lawyer to deal that way with a man like Galloway
And neither is it the custom for anyone to have any selfrespect
Does Galloway need my brains more than I need his money or do I need his money more than he needs my brains
You know what the answer to that is Billy
We are partnersyou and I Im training you for the position
Galloway wont come said Tetlow curtly
So much the worse for him retorted Norman placidly
NoIve not been drinking too much old manas your worriedoldmaid look suggests
Do a little thinking
If Galloway doesnt get me whom will he get
You know very well Norman there are scores of lawyers good ones whod crawl at his feet for his business
Nowadays most lawyers are always looking round for a pair of rich mans boots to lick
But I am not most lawyers  said Norman
Of course if Galloway could make me come to him hed be a fool to come to me
But when he finds Im not coming why hell behave himselfif his business is important enough for me to bother with
But if he doesnt come Fred
Thenmy Universal Fuel scheme or some other equally good
But you will never see me limbering my knees in the anteroom of a rich man when he needs me and I dont need him
Well well see said Tetlow with the air of a sober man patient with one who is not sober
By the way continued Norman if Galloway says hes too ill to comeor anything of that sort tell him Id not care to undertake the affairs of a man too old or too feeble to attend to business as he might die in the midst of it
Tetlows face was such a wondrous exhibit of discomfiture that Norman laughed outright
Evidently he had forestalled his fat friend in a scheme to get him to Galloway in spite of himself
All rightall right said Tetlow fretfully
Well sleep on this
But I dont see why youre so opposed to going to see the man
It looks like snobbishness to mefalse pride silly false pride
It IS snobbishness said Norman
But you forget that snobbishness rules the world
The way to rule fools is to make them respect you
And the way to make them respect you is by showing them that they are your inferiors
I want Galloways respect because I want his money
And Ill not get his money as much of it as belongs to meexcept by showing him my value
Not my value as a lawyer for he knows that already but my value as a man
Do you see
No I dont snapped Tetlow
Thats what it means to be Tetlow
Now I do seeand thats why Im Norman
Tetlow looked at him doubtfully uncertain whether he had been listening to wisdom put in a jocose form of audacious egotism or to the effervescings of intoxication
The hint of a smile lurking in the sobriety of the powerful features of his extraordinary friend only increased his doubt
Was Norman mocking him and himself as well
If so was it the mockery of sober sense or of drunkenness
You seem to be puzzled Billy said Norman and Tetlow wondered how he had seen
Dont get your brains in a stew trying to understand me
Im acting the way Ive always actedexcept in one matter
You know that I know what Im about
I certainly do replied his admirer
Then let it go at that
If you could understand methe sort of man I am the sort of thing I do youd not need me but would be the whole show yourself eh
That being true dont show yourself a com monplace nobody by deriding and denying what your brain is unable to comprehend
Show yourself a somebody by seeing the limitations of your ability
The world is full of little people who criticise and judge and laugh at and misunderstand the few real intelligences
And very tedious interruptions of the scenery those little people are
Dont be one of them



Did you know my wifes father
Tetlow startled
Nothat is yes he stammered
That is I met him a few times
Often enough to find out that he was crazy
Oh yes
He explained some of his ideas to me
Yeshe was quite mad poor fellow
Norman gave way to a fit of silent laughter
I can imagine he presently said what youd have thought if Columbus or Alexander or Napoleon or Stevenson or even the chaps who doped out the telephone and the telegraphif they had talked to you before they arrived
Or even after they arrived if they had been explaining some still newer and bigger idea not yet accomplished
You dont think Mr Hallowell was mad
He was mad assuming that you are the standard of sanity
Otherwise he was a great man
Therell be statues erected and pages of the book of fame devoted to the men who carry out his ideas
His death was certainly a great loss to his daughter said Tetlow in his heaviest most bourgeois manner
I said he was a great man observed Norman
I didnt say he was a great father
A great man is never a great father
It takes a small man to be a great father
At any rate her having no parents or relatives doesnt matter now that she has you said Tetlow his manner at once forced and constrained
Um muttered Norman
Said Tetlow Perhaps you misunderstood why I I acted as I did about her toward the last
It was of no importance said Norman brusquely
I wish to hear nothing about it
But I must explain Fred
She piqued me by showing so plainly that she despised me
I must admit the truth though Ive got as much vanity as the next man and dont like to admit it
She despised me and it made me mad
An expression of grim satire passed over Normans face
Said he She despised me too
Yes she did said Tetlow
And both of us were certainly greatly her superiorsin every substantial way
It seemed to me mostmost Most impertinent of her
suggested Norman
Precisely
MOST impertinent
Rather say ignorant and small
My dear Tetlow let me tell you something
Anybody however insignificant can be loved
To be loved means nothing except possibly a hallucination in the brain of the lover
But to LOVEthats another matter
Only a great soul is capable of a great love
That is true murmured Tetlow sentimentally preening in a quiet gentle way
Said Norman sententiously YOU stopped loving
It was I that kept on
Tetlow looked uncomfortable
Yesyes he said
But we were talking of herof her not appreciating the love she got
And I was about to say Earnestly Fred shes not to be blamed for her folly
Shes very very youngand has all the weaknesses and vanities of youth Here we are interrupted Norman
The hansom had stopped in Fortysecond Street before the deserted but still brilliantly lighted entrances to the great hotel
Norman sprang out so lightly and surely that Tetlow wondered how it was possible for this to be the man who had been racketing and roistering day after day night after night for nearly a week
He helped the heavy and awkward Tetlow to descend said Youll have to pay Bill
Ive got less than a dollar left
And I touched Gaskill for a hundred and fifty tonight
You can imagine how drunk he was to let me have it
How theyve been shying off from ME these last few months
And you want GALLOWAY to come to YOU thrust Tetlow as he counted out the money
Dont go back and chew on that laughed Norman
Its settled
He took the money gave it to the driver
Thanks he said to Tetlow
Ill pay you tomorrowthat is later todaywhen you send me another check
Why should you pay for my cab
rejoined Tetlow
Because its easier for me to make money than it is for you replied Norman
If you were in my positionthe position Ive been in for monthswould anybody on earth give you three thousand dollars a month
Tetlow looked sour
His good nature was rubbing thin in spots
Dont lose your temper laughed Norman
Im pounding away at you about my superiority partly because Ive been drinking but chiefly for your own goodso that youll realize Im right and not mess things with Galloway
They went up to Normans suite
Norman tried to unlock the door found it already unlocked
He turned the knob threw the door wide for Tetlow to enter first
Then over Tetlows shoulder he saw on the marble topped center table Dorothys hat and jacket the one she had worn away the only one she had
He stared at them then at Tetlow
A confused look in the fat slow face made him say sharply What does this mean Tetlow
Not so loud Fred said Tetlow closing the door into the public hall
Shes in the bedroomprobably asleep
Shes been here since yesterday
You brought her back
demanded Norman
She wanted to come
I simply Norman made a silencing gesture
Tetlows faltering voice stopped short
Norman stood near the table his hands deep in his trousers pockets his gaze fixed upon the hat and jacket
When Tetlows agitation could bear the uncertainties of that silence no longer he went on Fred you mustnt forget how young and inexperienced she is
Shes been foolish but nothing more
Shes as pure as when she came into the world
And its the truth that she wanted to come back
I saw it as soon as I began to talk with her
What are you chattering about
said Norman fiercely
Why did you meddle in my affairs
Why did you bring her back
I knew she needed you pleaded Tetlow
Then tooI was afraid I knew how you acted before and I thought youd not get your gait again until you had her
Norman gave a short sardonic laugh
If youd only stop trying to understand me
he said
Tetlow was utterly confused
But Fred you dont realizenot all he cried imploringly
She discoveredshe thinks I believethat issheshe that probablythat in a few months youll be something more than a husbandand she something more than a wifethat youthatyou and she will be a father and a mother
Tetlows meaning slowly dawned on Norman
He seated himself in his favorite attitude legs sprawled fingers interlaced behind his head
Wasnt I right to bring her backto tell her she neednt fear to come
pleaded Tetlow
Norman made no reply
After a brief silence he said Well good night old man
Come round to my office any time after ten
He rose and gave Tetlow his hand
And arrange for Galloway whenever you like
Good night
Tetlow hesitated
Fredyoull not be harsh to her
he said
Norman smileda satirical smile yet exquisitely gentle
If you ONLY wouldnt try to understand me Bill he said
When he was alone he sat lost in thought
At last he rang for a bell boy
And when the boy came he said That door thereindicating one in the opposite wall of the sitting roomwhat does it lead into
Another bedroom sir
Unlock it and tell them at the office I wish that room added to my suite
As soon as the additional bedroom was at his dis posal he went in and began to undress
When he had taken off coat and waistcoat he paused to telephone to the office a call for eight oclock
As he finished and hung up the receiver a sound from the direction of the sitting room made him glance in there
On the threshold of the other bedroom stood his wife
She was in her nightgown her hair done in a single thick braid hung down across her bosom
There was in the room and upon her childish loveliness the strange commingling of lights and shadows that falls when the electricity is still on and the early morning light is pushing in at the windows
They looked at each other in silence for some time
If she was frightened or in the least embarrassed she did not show it
She simply looked at him while ever so slowly a smile dawned a gleam in the eyes a flutter round the lips growing merrier and merrier
He did not smile
He continued to regard her gravely
I heard you and Mr Tetlow come in she said
Thenyou talked so longI fell asleep again
I only this minute awakened
Well now you can go to sleep again said he
But Im not a bit sleepy
What are you doing in that room 
She advanced toward his door
He stood aside
She peeped in
She was so close to him that her nightgown brushed the bosom of his shirt
Another bedroom
she exclaimed
Just like ours
I didnt wish to disturb you said he calm and grave
But you wouldnt have been disturbing me protested she leaning against the door frame less than two feet away and directly facing him
Ill stay on here said he
She gazed at him with great puzzled eyes
Arent you glad Im back
she asked
Certainly said he with a polite smile
But I must get some sleep
And he moved away
You must let me tell you how I happened to go and why I came Please he interrupted looking at her with a piercing though not in the least unfriendly expression that made her grow suddenly pale and thoughtful
I do not wish to hear about itnot nownot ever
Tetlow told me all that its necessary for me to know
You have come to stay I assume
Yesifher lip quiveredif youll let me
There can be no question of that said he with the same polite gravity he had maintained throughout
You want me to leave you alone
Please
I need sleep badlyand Ive only three hours
You areangry with me
He looked placidly into her lovely swimming eyes
Not in the least
But how can you help being
I acted dreadfully
He smiled gently
But you are backand the incident is closed
She looked down at the carpet her fingers playing with her braid twisting and untwisting its strands
He stood waiting to close the door
She said without lifting her eyessaid in a quiet expressionless way I have killed your love
Ill not trouble you any more evaded he
And he laid his hand significantly upon the knob
I dont understand she murmured
Then with a quick apologetic glance at him But Im very inconsiderate
You want to sleep
Good night
Good night said he beginning to close the door
She impulsively stood close before him lifted her small white face as if for a kiss
Do you forgive me
she asked
I was foolish
I didnt understand till I went back
Thennothing was the same
And I knew I wasnt fitted for that lifeand didnt really care for himand He kissed her on the brow
Dont agitate yourself said he
And we will never speak of this again
She shrank as if he had struck her
Her head drooped and her shoulders
When she was clear of the door he quietly closed it
XIX IT was not many minutes after ten when Tetlow hurried into Normans office
Galloways coming at eleven
said he with an air of triumph
So you mulled over what I said and decided that I was not altogether drunk
I wasnt sure of that replied Tetlow
But I was afraid youd be offended if I didnt try to get him
He gave me no trouble at all
As soon as I told him youd be glad to see him at your office he astounded me by saying hed come
He and I have had dealings said Norman
He understood at once
I always know my way when Im dealing with a big man
Its only the little people that are muddled and complex
I hope youll not forget this lesson Billy
I shant promised Tetlow
We are to be partners pursued Norman
We shall be intimately associated for years
Youll save me a vast amount of time and energy and yourself a vast amount of fuming and fretting if youll simply accept what I say without discussion
When I want discussion Ill ask your advice
Im afraid you dont think its worth much said Tetlow humbly and I guess it isnt
On the contrary invaluable declared Norman with flattering emphasis
Where you lack and I excel is in decision and action
Ill often get you to tell me what ought to be done and then Ill make you do it which youd never dare by yourself
At eleven sharp Galloway came looking as nearly like a dangerous old eagle as a human being well could
Rapacious merciless tyrannical a famous philanthropist
Stingy to pettiness a giver away of millions
Rigidly honest yet absolutely unscrupulous faithful to the last letter of his given word yet so treacherous where his sly mind could nose out a way to evade the spirit of his agreements that his name was a synonym for unfaithfulness
An assiduous and groveling snob yet so militantly democratic that unless his interest compelled he would not employ any member of the best families in any important capacity
He seemed a bundle of contradictions
In fact he was profoundly consistent
That is to say he steadily pursued in every thought and act the gratification of his two passionswealth and power
He lost no seen opportunity however shameful to add to his fortune or to amuse himself with the human race which he regarded with the unpitying contempt characteristic of every cold nature born or risen to success
His theory of lifeand it is the theory that explains most great financial successes however they may pretend or believehis theory of life was that he did not need friends because the friends of a strong man weaken and rob him but that he did need enemies because he could grow rich and powerful destroying and despoiling them
To him friends suggested the birds living in a tree
They might make the tree more romantic to the unthinking observer but they in fact ate its budding leaves and its fruit and rotted its bough joints with their filthy nests
We Americans are probably nearest to children of any race in civilization
The peculiar conditions of lifetheir almost Arcadian simplicityup to a generation or so ago gave us a false training in the study of human nature
We believe what the good preacher the novelist and the poet all as ignorant of life as nursery books tell us about the human heart
We fancy that in a social system modeled upon the cruel and immoral system of Nature success is to the good and kind
Life is like the pious story in the Sundayschool library evil is the exception and to practice the simple virtues is to tread with sure step the highway to riches and fame
This sort of ignorance is taught is proclaimed is apparently accepted throughout the world
Literature and the drama representing life as it is dreamed by humanity life as it perhaps may be some day create an impression which defies the plain daily and hourly mockings of experience
Because weak and petty of fenders are often punished the universe is pictured as sternly enforcing the criminal codes enacted by priests or lawyers
But while all the world half inclines to this agreeable mendacity about life only in America of all civilization is the mendacity accepted as gospel and suspicion about it frowned upon as the heresy of cynicism
So the Galloways prosper and are in high moral repute
Some day we shall learn that a social system which is merely a slavish copy of Natures barbarous and wasteful sway of the survival of the toughest could be and ought to be improved upon by the intelligence of the human race
Some day we shall put Nature in its proper place as kindergarten teacher and drop it from godship and erect enlightened human understanding instead
But that is a long way off
Meanwhile the Galloways will reign and will assure us that they won their success by the Decalogue and the Golden Rule and will be believed by all who seek to assure for themselves in advance almost certain failure at material success in the arena of action
But they will not be believed by men of ambition pushing resolutely for power and wealth
So Frederick Norman knew precisely what he was facing when Galloways tall gaunt figure and face of the bird of prey appeared before him
Galloway had triumphed and was triumphing not through obedience to the Sunday sermons and the silly novels poems plays and the nonsense chattered by the obscure multitudes whom the mighty few exploit but through obedience to the conditions imposed by our social system
If he raised wages a little it was in order that he might have excuse for raising prices a great deal
If he gave away millions it was for his fame and usually to quiet the scandal over some particularly wicked wholesale robbery
No Galloway was not a witness to the might of altruistic virtue as a means to triumph
Charity and all the other forms of chicanery by which the many are defrauded and fooled by the fewthose virtues he understood and practiced
But justicehumanitys ageslong dream that at last seems to glitter as a hope in the horizon of the futurejusticenot legal justice nor moral justice but human justicethat idea would have seemed to him ridiculous Utopian something for the women and the children and the socialists
Norman understood Galloway and Galloway understood Norman
Galloway with an old mans garrulity and a confirmed moral poseurs eagerness about appearances began to unfold his virtuous reasons for the impending break with Burroughsthe industrial and financial war out of which he expected to come doubly rich and all but supreme
Midway he stopped
You are not listening said he sharply to the young man
Their eyes met
Normans eyes were twinkling
No said he I am waiting
There was the suggestion of an answering gleam of sardonic humor in Galloways cold gray eyes
Waiting for what
For you to finish with me as father confessor to begin with me as lawyer
Pray dont hurry
My time is yours
This with a fine air of utmost suavity and respect
In fact while Galloway was doddering on and on with his fake moralities Norman was thinking of his own affairs was wondering at his indifference about Dorothy
The night beforethe few hours beforewhen he had dealt with her so calmly he even as he talked and listened and acted had assumed that the enormous amount of liquor he had been consuming was in some way responsible
He had said to himself When I am over this when I have had sleep and return to the normal I shall again be the foolish slave of all these months
But here he was sober having taken only enough whisky to prevent an abrupt letdownhere he was viewing her in the same tranquil light
No longer all his life no longer even dominant only a part of life and he was by no means certain that she was an important part
How explain the mystery of the change
Because she had voluntarily come back did he feel that she was no longer baffling but was definitely his
Or had passion running madly on and on droppedperhaps not dead but almost deadfrom sheer exhaustionwas it weary of racing and content to saunter and to stroll



He could not account for the change
He only knew that he who had been quite mad was now quite sane



Would he like to be rid of her
Did he regret that they were tied together
No curiously enough
It was high time he got married she would do as well as another
She had beauty youth amiability physical charm for him
There was advantage in the fact that her inferiority to him her dependence on him would enable him to take as much or as little of her as he might feel disposed to treat her as the warrior must ever treat his entire domestic establishment from wife down to pet dog or cat or baby



No he did not regret Josephine
He could see now disadvantages greater than her advantages
All of value she would have brought him he could get for himself and she would have been troublesomeexacting disputing his sway demanding full value or more in return for the love she was giving with such exalted notions of its worth
You are married
Galloway suddenly said interrupting his own speech and Normans thought
Yes said Norman
Just married I believe
Just
Young and old high and low successful and failed we are a race of advicegivers
As for Galloway he was not one to neglect that showy form of inexpensive benevolence
Have plenty of children said he
And keep your family in the country till they grow up
Towns no place for women
They go crazy
Womenand most menhave no initiative
They think only about whatevers thrust at them
In the country itll be their children and domestic things
In town itll be getting and spending money
Norman was struck by this
I think Ill take your advice said he
A mans home ought to be a retreat not an inn
We are humoring the women too much
They are forgetting who earns what they spend in exhibiting themselves
If a woman wants that sort of thing let her get out and earn it
Why should she expect it from the man who has undertaken her support because he wanted a wife to take care of his house and a mother for his children
If a woman doesnt like the job all right
But if she takes it and accepts its pay why she should do its work
Flawless logic said Norman
When I hire a man to work he doesnt expect to idle about showing other people how handsome he is in the clothes my money pays for
Not that marriage is altogether a businessnot at all
But my dear sir And Galloway brought his cane down with the emphasis of one speaking from a heart full of bitter experience unless it is a business at bottom organized and conducted on sound business principles theres no sentiment either
We are human beingsand that means we are first of all BUSINESS beings engaged in getting food clothing shelter
No sentimentNO sentiment sir is worth while that isnt firmly grounded
Its a house without a foundation
Its a steeple without a church under it
Norman looked at the old man with calm penetrating eyes
I shall conduct my married life on a sound business basis or not at all said he
Well see said Galloway
Thats what I said forty years ago No I didnt
I had no sense about such matters then
In my youth the men knew nothing about the woman question
He smiled grimly
I see signs that they are learning
Then as abruptly as he had left the affairs he was there to discuss he returned to them
His mind seemed to have freed itself of all irrelevancy and superfluity as a stream often runs from a faucet with much spluttering and rather muddy at first then steadies and clears
Norman gave him the attention one can get only from a good mind that is interested in the subject and understands it thoroughly
Such attention not merely receives the words and ideas as they fall from the mouth of him who utters them but also seems to draw them by a sort of suction faster and in greater abundance
It was this peculiar ability of giving attention as much as any other one quality that gave Normans clients their confidence in him
Galloway than whom no man was shrewder judge of men showed in his gratified eyes and voice long before he had finished how strongly his conviction of Normans high ability was confirmed
When Galloway ended Norman rapidly and in clear and simple sentences summarized what Galloway had said
That is right
he asked
Precisely said Galloway admiringly
What a gift of clear statement you have young man
It has won me my place said Norman
As to your campaign I can tell you now that the legal part of it can be arranged
That is what the law is forto enable a man to do whatever he wants
The penalties are for those who have the stupidity to try to do things in an unlawful way
Galloway laughed
I had heard that they were for doing unlawful things
Nothing is unlawful said Norman except in method
Thats an interesting view of courts of justice
But we have no courts of justice
We have only courts of law
Galloway threw back his head and laughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks
What a gift for clear statement
he cried
Norman beamed appreciation of a compliment so flattering
But he went back to business
As I was saying you can do what you want to do
You wish me to show you how
In our modern way of doing things the relation of lawyer and client has somewhat changed
To illustrate by this case you are the bear with the taste for honey and the strength to rob the bees
I am the honey birdthat is the modern lawyer who can show you the way to the hive
Most of the honey birdsas yetare content with a very small share of the honeywhatever the bear happens to be unable to find room for
But I Normans eyes danced and his strong mouth curved in a charming smile I am a honey bird with a bear appetite
Galloway was sitting up stiffly
I dont quite follow you sir he said
Yet I am plain enough
My ability at clear statement has not deserted me
If I show you the way through the tangled forest of the law to this hive you scentI must be a partner in the honey
Galloway rose
Your conceptions of your profession and of me I may sayare not attractive
I have always been and am willing and anxious to pay liberallymore liberally than anyone elsefor legal advice
But my business sir is my own
Norman rose his expression one of apology and polite disappointment
I see I misunderstood your purpose in coming to me said he
Let us take no more of each others time
And what did you think my object was in coming
demanded Galloway
To get from me what you realized you could get nowhere elsewhich meant as an old experienced trader like you must have known that you were ready to pay my price
Of course if you can get elsewhere the assistance you need why you would be most unwise to come to me
Galloway moved toward the door
And you might have charged practically any fee you wished said he laughing satirically
Young man you are making the mistake that is ruining this generation
You wish to get rich all at once
You are not willing to be patient and to work and to build your fortune solidly and slowly
Norman smiled as at a good joke
What an asset to you strong men has been the vague hope in the minds of the masses that each poor devil of them will have his turn to loot and grow rich
I used to think ignorance kept the present system going
But I have discovered that it is that sly silly corrupt hope
But sir it does not catch me
I shall not work for you and the other strong men and patiently wait my turn that would never come
My time is NOW
You threaten me
cried Galloway furiously
Threaten you
exclaimed Norman amazed
You think because I have given you my lawyer my secrets that you can compel me With an imperious gesture Norman stopped him
Good day sir he said haughtily
Your secrets are safe with me
I am a lawyer not a financier
Galloway was disconcerted
I beg your pardon Mr Norman he said
I misunderstood you
I thought I heard you say in effect that you purposed to be rich and that you purposed to compel me to make you so
So I did replied Norman
But not by the methods you financiers are so adept at using
Not by highclass blackmail and blackjacking
I meant that my abilities were such that you and your fellow masters of modern society would be compelled to employ me on my own terms
A few moments ago you outlined to me a plan
It may be you can find other lawyers competent to steer it through the channel of the law
I doubt it
I may exaggerate my value
But He smiled pleasantlyI dont think so
In this modern world of ours there is no more delicate or more important branch of the art of material success than learning to play ones own tune on the trumpets of fame
To those who watch careers intelligently and critically and not merely with mouth agape and ears awag for whatever sounds the winds of credulity bear there is keen interest in noting how differently this high art is practiced by the fameseekershow well some modest heroes disguise themselves before essaying the trumpet how timidly some play how brazenly others
It is an art of infinite variety
How many there are who can echo Shakespeares sad lament through Hamlets lipsI lack advancement
Those are they who have wholly neglected as did Shakespeare this essential part of the art of advancementShakespeare who lived almost obscure and was all but forgotten for two centuries after his death
Norman frankly seeking mere material success and with the colossal egotism that disdains egotism and shrugs at the danger of being accused of itNorman did not hesitate to proclaim his own merits
He reasoned that he had the wares that crying them would attract attention to them that he whose attention was attracted if he were a judge of wares and a seeker of the best would see that the Norman wares were indeed as Norman cried them
At first blush Galloway was amused by Normans candid selfesteem
But he had often heard of Normans conceitand in a long and busy life he had not seen an able man who was unaware of his ability any more than he had seen a pretty woman unaware of her prettiness
So at second blush Galloway was tempted by Normans calm strong blast upon his own trumpet to look again at the wares
I always have had a high opinion of you young man said he with laughing eyes
Almost as high an opinion as you have of yourself
Think over the legal side of my plan
When you get your thoughts in order let me knowand make me a proposition as to your own share
Does that satisfy you
Its all I ask said Norman
And they parted on the friendliest termsand Norman knew that his fortune was assured if Galloway lived another nine months
When he was alone the sweat burst out upon him and trembling from head to foot he locked his door and flung himself at full length upon the rug
It was half an hour before the fit of silent hysterical reaction passed sufficiently to let him gather strength to rise
He tottered to his desk chair and sat with his head buried in his arms upon the desk
After a while the telephone at his side rang insistently
He took the receiver in a hand he could not steady
Yes
he called
Its Tetlow
Howd you come out
Oh He paused to stiffen his throat to attack the words naturallyall right
We go ahead
With G
Certainly
But keep quiet
Dont let him know youve heard if you see him or he sends for you
Remember its in my hands entirely
Trust me
Tetlows voice suppressed and jubilant suggested a fat hoarse rooster trying to finish a crow before a coming stone from a farm boy reaches him
It seems natural and easy to you old man
But Im about crazy with joy
Ill come right over
No
Im going home
Cant I see you there
No
Ive other matters to attend to
Come about lunch time tomorrowto the office here
All right said Tetlow disappointedly and Norman rang off
XX IN the faces of men who have dominion of whatever kind over their fellow menbe it the brutal rule of the prize fighter over his gang or the apparently gentle sway of the apparently meek bishop over his loving flockin the faces of all men of power there is a dangerous look
They may never lose their tempers
They may never lift their voices
They may be ever suave and civil
The dangerous look is thereand the danger behind it
And the sense of that look and of its cause has a certain restraining effect upon all but the hopelessly impudent or solidly dense
Norman was one of the men without fits of temper
In his moments of irritation no one ever felt that a storm of violent language might be impending
But the danger signal flaunted from his face
Danger of what
No one could have said
Most people would have laughed at the idea that so even tempered a man pleased with himself and with the world could ever be dangerous
Yet everyone had instinctively respected that danger flaguntil Dorothy
Perhaps it had struck for herhad really not been there when she looked at him
Perhaps she had been too inexperienced perhaps too selfcentered to see it
Perhaps she had never before seen his face in an hour of weariness and relaxationwhen the true character the dominating and essential trait or traits shows nakedly upon the surface making the weak man or woman look pitiful the strong man or woman formidable
However that may be when he walked into the sitting room greeted her placidly and kissed her on the brow she glancing uncertainly up at him saw that danger signal for the first time
She studied his face her own face wearing her expression of the puzzled child
No not quite that expression as it always had been theretofore but a modified form of it
To any selfcentered selfabsorbed womanthere comes in her married life unless she be married to a booby a time an hour a moment evenfor it can be narrowed down to a pointwhen she takes her first SEEING look at the man upon whom she is dependent for protection whether spiritual or material or both
In her egotism and vanity she has been regarding him as her property
Suddenly and usually disagreeably it has been revealed to her that she is his property
That hour had come for Dorothy Norman
And she was looking at her husband was wondering who and what he was
Youve had your lunch
he said
No replied she
You have been out for the air
No
Why not
You didnt tell me what to do
He smiled good humoredly
Oh you had no money
Yesa little
But I She halted
Yes
You hadnt told me what to do she repeated as if on mature thought that sentence expressed the whole matter
He felt in his pockets found a small roll of bills
He laid twentyfive dollars on the table
Ill keep thirty he said as I shant have any more till I see Tetlow tomorrow
Now fly out and amuse yourself
Im going to sleep
Dont wake me till youre ready for dinner
And he went into his bedroom and closed the door
When he awoke he saw that it was dark outside and some note in the din of street noises from far below made him feel that it was late
He wrapped a bath robe round him opened the door into the sitting room
It was dark
Dorothy
he called
Yes promptly responded the small quiet voice so near that he started back
Oh
he exclaimed and switched on the light
There you areby the window
What were you doing in the dark
She was dressed precisely as when he had last seen her
She was sitting with her hands listless in her lap and her face a moving and beautiful expression of melancholy dreams
On the table were the billswhere he had laid them
Youve been out
he said
No she replied
Why not
Ive beenwaiting
For what
laughed he
ForI dont know she replied
Just waiting
But theres nothing to wait for
She looked at him interrogatively
NoI suppose not she said
He went back into his room and glanced at his watch
Eleven oclock
he cried
Why didnt you wake me
You must be nearly starved
Yes I am hungry said she
Her patient passive resignation irritated him
Im ravenous he said
Ill dressand you dress too
Well go downstairs to supper
When he reappeared in the sitting room in a dinner jacket she was again seated near the window hands listless in her lap and eyes gazing dreamily into vacancy
But she was now dressed in the black chiffon and the big black hat
He laughed
You are prompt and obedient said he
Nothing like hunger to subdue
A faint flush tinged her lovely skin the look of the child that has been struck appeared in her eyes
He cast about in his mind for the explanation
Did she think he meant it was need that had brought her meekly back to him
That was true enough but he had not intended to hint it
In high good humor because he was so delightfully hungry and was about to get food he cried Do cheer up
Theres nothing to be sad aboutnothing
She lifted her large eyes and gazed at him timidly
What are you going to do with me
Take you downstairs and feed you
But I meanafterward
Bringor sendyou up here to go to bed
Are you going away
Where
Away from me
He looked at her with amused eyes
She was exquisitely lovely never had he seen her lovelier
It delighted him to note her charmsthe charms that had enslaved himnot a single charm missingand to feel that he was no longer their slave was his own master again
A strange look swept across her uncannily mobile facea look of wonder of awe of fear of dread
You dont even like me any more she said in her colorless way
What have I done to make you think I dislike you
said he pleasantly
She gazed down in silence
You need have no fear said he
You are my wife
You will be well taken care of and you will not be annoyed
What more can I say
Thank you she murmured
He winced
She had made him feel like an unpleasant cross between an almsgiver and a bully
Now said he with forced but resolute cheerfulness we will eat drink and be merry
On the way down in the elevator he watched her out of the corner of his eye
When they reached the hall leading to the supper room he touched her arm and halted her
My dear said he in the pleasant voice which yet somehow never failed to secure attention and obedience there will be some of my acquaintances in there at supper
I dont want them to see you with that whipped dog look
Theres no occasion for it
Her lip trembled
Ill do my best said she
Lets see you smile laughed he
You have often shown me that you know the womans trick of wearing what feelings you choose on the outside
So dont pretend that youve got to look as if you were about to be hung for a crime you didnt commit
Therethats better
And indeed to a casual glance she looked the happy bride tryingnot very successfullyto seem used to her husband and her new status
Hold it
he urged gayly
Ive no fancy for leading round a lovely martyr in chains
Especially as youre about as healthy and well placed a person as I know
And youll feel as well as you look when youve had something to eat
Whether it was obedience or the result of a decision to drop an unprofitable pose he could not tell but as soon as they were seated and she had a bill of fare before her and was reading it her expression of happiness lost its last suggestion of being forced
Crab meat
she said
I love it
Two portions of crab meat he said to the waiter with pad and pencil at attention
Oh I dont want that much she protested
You forget that I am hungry rejoined he
And when I am hungry the price of food begins to go up
He addressed himself to the waiter After that a broiled grousewith plenty of hominyand grilled sweet potatoesand a salad of endive and hot house tomatoesand I know the difference between hot house tomatoes and the other kinds
Nextsome cheeseCoullomieresyes you have itI got the steward to get itand toasted crackersthe round kind not the squareand not the hard ones that unsettle the teethandwhat kind of ice my dearor would you prefer a fresh peach flambee
YesI think so said Dorothy
You hear waiterand a bottle oftheres the head waiterask himhe knows the champagne I like
As Norman had talked in the pleasant insistent voice the waiter had roused from the air of mindless mechanical sloth characteristic of the New York waiterunless and until a fee below his high expectation is offered
When he said the final very good sir it was with the accent of real intelligence
Dorothy was smiling with the amusement of youth and inexperience
What a lot of trouble you took about it said she
He shrugged his shoulders
Anything worth doing at all is worth taking trouble about
You will see
We shall get results
The supper will be the best this house can put together
You can have anything you want in this world if you only can pay for it said she
Thats what most people think replied he
But the truth is the paying is only a small part of the art of getting what one wants
She glanced nervously at him
Im beginning to realize that Im dreadfully inexperienced said she
Theres nothing discouraging in that said he
Lack of experience can be remedied
But not lack of judgment
It takes the great gift of judgment to enable one to profit by mistakes to decide what is the real lesson of an experience
Im afraid I havent any judgment either confessed she
That remains to be seen
She hesitatedventured What do you think is my worst fault
He shook his head laughingly
We are going to have a happy supper
Do you think I am very vain
persisted she
Whos been telling you so
Mr Tetlow
He gave me an awful talking to just before I She paused at the edge of the forbidden ground
He didnt spare me she went on
He said I was a vain selfcentered little fool
And what did you say
I was very angry
I told him he had no right to accuse me of that
I reminded him that he had never heard me say a word about myself
And did he say that the vainest people were just that waynever speaking of themselves never thinking of anything else
Oh he told you what he said cried she
No laughed he
She reddened
YOU think Im vain
He made a goodhumoredly satirical little bow
I think you are charming said he
It would be a waste of time to look at or to think of anyone else when oneself is the most charming and interesting person in the world
Still He put into his face and voice a suggestion of gravity that caught her utmost attention if one is to get anywhere is to win consideration from othersand happiness for oneselfone sim ply must do a little thinking about othersoccasionally
Her eyes lowered
A faint color tinged her cheeks
The reason most of us are so uncomfortable downright unhappy most of the timeis that we never really take our thoughts off our precious fascinating selves
The result is that some day we find that the likingand friendshipand loveof those around us has limitsand we are left severely alone
Of course if one has a great deal of money one can buy excellent imitations of liking and friendship and even loveI ought to say especially love The color flamed in her face
But he went on if one is in modest circumstances or poor one has to take care
Or dependent she said with one of those unexpected flashes of subtle intelligence that so complicated the study of her character
He had been talking to amuse himself rather than with any idea of her understanding
Her sudden bright color and her two wordsor dependentroused him to see that she thought he was deliberately giving her a savage lecture from the cover of general remarks
With the vanity of the typical woman he said to himself she always imagines SHE is the subject of everyones thought and talk
Or dependent said he to her easily
I wasnt thinking of you but yours IS a case in point
Come nownothing to look blue about
Heres something to eat
No its for the next table
You wont let me explain she protested between the prudence of reproach and the candor of anger
Theres nothing to explain replied he
Dont bother about the mistakes of yesterday
Remember themyes
If one has a good memory to forget is impossiblenot to say unwise
But there ought to be no more heat or sting in the memory of past mistakes than in the memory of last years mosquito bites
The first course of the supper arrived
Her nervousness vanished and he got far away from the neighborhood of the subjects that even in remotest hint could not but agitate her
And as the food and the wine asserted their pacific and beatific sway she and he steadily moved into better and better humor with each other
Her beauty grew until it had him thinking that never not in the most spiritual feminine conceptions of the classic painters had he seen a loveliness more ethereal
Her skin was so exquisite the coloring of her hair and eyes and of her lips was so delicately fine that it gave her the fragility of things bordering upon the supernalof rare exotics of sunset and moonbeam effects
No he had been under no spell of illusion as to her beauty
It was a realitythe more fascinating because it waxed and waned not with regularity of period but capriciously
He began to look round furtively to see what effect this wife of his was producing on others
These last few months through prudence as much as through pride he had been cultivating the habit of ignoring his surroundings he would not invite cold salutations or obvious avoidance of speaking
He now discovered many of his former associatesand his vanity dilated as he noted how intensely they were interested in his wife
Some men of ability have that purest form of egotism which makes one profoundly content with himself genuinely indifferent to the approval or the disapproval of others
Normans vanity had a certain amount of alloy
He genuinely disdained his fellowmentheir timidity their hypocrisy their servility their limited range of ideas
He was indifferent to the verge of insensibility as to their adverse criticism
But at the same time it was necessary to his happiness that he get from them evidences of their admiration and envy
With that amusing hypocrisy which tinges all human nature he concealed from himself the satisfaction the joy even he got out of the showy side of his position
And no feature of his infatuation for Dorothy surprised him so much as the way it rode rough shod and reckless over his snobbishness
With the fading of infatuation had come many reflections upon the practical aspects of what he had done
It pleased him with himself to find that in this first test he had not the least regret but on the con trary a genuine pride in the courageous independence he had shownanother and strong support to his conviction of his superiority to his fellowmen
He might be somewhat snobbishwho was notwho else in his New York was less than supersaturated with snobbishness
But snobbishness the determining quality in the natures of all the women and most of the men he knew had shown itself one of the incidental qualities in his own nature
After all reflected he it took a man a good deal of a man to do what he had done and not to regret it even in the hour of disillusionment
And it must be said for this egotistic selfapproval of his that like all his judgments there was sound merit of truth in it
The vanity of the nincompoop is ridiculous
The vanity of the man of ability is amusing and no doubt due to a defective point of view upon the proportions of the universe but it is not without excuse and those who laugh might do well to discriminate even as they guffaw
Looking discreetly about Norman was suddenly confronted by the face of Josephine Burroughs only two tables away
Until their eyes squarely met he did not know she was there or even in America
Before he could make a beginning of glancing away she gave him her sweetest smile and her friendliest bow
And Dorothy looking to see to whom he was speaking was astonished to receive the same radiance of cordiality
Norman was pleased at the way his wife dealt with the situation
She returned both bow and smile in her own quiet slightly reserved way of gentle dignity
Who was that speaking
asked she
Miss Burroughs
You must remember her
He noted it as characteristic that she said quite sincerely Oh so it is
I didnt remember her
That is the girl you were engaged to
Yesthe nice girl uptown  said he
I didnt like her said Dorothy with evident small interest in the subject
She was vain
You mean you didnt like her way of being vain suggested Norman
Everyone is vain so if we disliked for vanity we should dislike everyone
Yes it was her way
And just now she spoke to us both as if she were doing us a favor
Gracious its called said he
What of it
It does us no harm and gives her about the only happiness shes got
Norman without seeming to do so noted the rest of the Burroughs party
At Josephines right sat a handsome young foreigner and it took small experience of the world to discover that he was paying court to her and that she was pleased and flattered
Norman asked the waiter who he was and learned that he came from the waiters own province of France was the Duc de Valdome
At first glance Norman had thought him distinguished
Afterward he discriminated
There are several kinds or degrees of distinction
There is distinction of race of class of family of dress of person
As Frenchman as aristocrat as a scion of the ancient family of Valdome as a specimen of tailoring and valeting Miss Burroughss young man was distinguished
But in his own proper person he was rather insignificant
The others at the table were Americans
Following Miss Burroughss cue they sought an opportunity to speak friendlily to Normanand he gave it them
His acknowledgment of those effusive salutations was polite but restrained
They are friends of yours
said Dorothy
They were said he
And they may be again when they are friends of OURS
Im not very good at making friends she warned him
I dont like many people
This time her unconscious and profound egotism pleased him
Evidently it did not occur to her that she should be eager to be friends with those people on any terms that the only question was whether they would receive her
She asked Why was MissMiss Burroughs so friendly
Why shouldnt she be
But I thought you threw her over
He winced at this crude way of putting it
On the contrary she threw me over
Dorothy laughed incredulously
I know better
Mr Tetlow told me
She threw me over repeated he coldly
Tetlow was repeating malicious and ignorant gossip
Dorothy laughed againit was her second glass of champagne
You say that because its the honorable thing to say
But I know
I say it because its true said he
He spoke quietly but if she had drunk many more than two glasses of an unaccustomed and heady liquor she would have felt his intonation
She paled and shrank and her slim white fingers fluttered nervously at the collar of her dress
I was only joking she murmured
He laughed goodnaturedly
Dont look as if I had given you a whipping said he
Surely youre not afraid of me
She glanced shyly at him a smile dancing in her eyes and upon her lips
Yes she said
And after a pause she added I didnt used to be
But that was because I didnt know youor much of anything
The smile irradiated her whole face
You used to be afraid of me
But you arent any more
No said he looking straight at her
No Im not
I always told you you were mistaken in what you thought of me
I really dont amount to much
A man as serious and as important as you are couldnt couldnt care about me
Its true you dont amount to much as yet said he
And if you never do amount to much youd be no less than most women and most men
But Ive an idea at timesthat you COULD amount to something
He saw that he had wounded her vanity that her protestations of humility were precisely what he had suspected
He laughed at her I see you thought Id contradict you
But I cant afford to be so amiable now
And the first thing youve got to get rid of is the part of your vanity that prevents you from growing
Vanity of belief in ones possibilities is fine
No one gets anywhere without it
But vanity of belief in ones present perfectionno one but a god could afford that luxury
Observing her closely he was amusedand pleased to note that she was struggling to compose herself to endure his candors as a necessary part of the duties and obligations she had taken on herself when she gave up and returned to him
What YOU thought of ME used to be the important thing in our relations he went on in his way of raillery that took all or nearly all the sting out of what he said but none of its strength
Now the important thing is what I think of you
You are much younger than I especially in experience
You are going to school to life with me as teacher
Youll dislike the teacher for the severity of the school
That isnt just but its naturalperhaps inevitable
And pleasemy dear when you are bitterest over what YOU have to put up with from MEdont forget what I have to put up with from YOU
She was fighting bravely against angry tears
As for him he had suddenly become indifferent to what the people around them might be thinking
With all his old arrogance come back in full flood he was feeling that he would live his own life in his own way and that those who didnt approveyes including Dorothy might do as they saw fit
She said I dont blame you for regretting that you didnt marry Miss Burroughs
But I dont regret it replied he
On the contrary Im glad
She glanced hopefully at him
But the hopeful expression faded as he went on Whether or not I made a mistake in marrying you I certainly had an escape from disaster when she decided she preferred a foreigner and a title
Theres a good sensible reason why so many girls of her class more and more all the timemarry abroad
They are not fit to be the wives of hardworking American husbands
In fact Ive about reached the conclusion that of the girls growing up nowdays very few in any class are fit to be American wives
Theyre not big enough
Theyre too coarse and crude in their tastes
Theyre only fit for the shallow showy sort of thingand the European aristocracy is their hopeand their place
Her small face had a fascinating expression of a illust
caption  At Josephine s right sat a handsome young foreigner
child trying to understand things far beyond its depth
He was interested in his own thoughts however and went onfor if he had been in the habit of stopping when his hearers failed to understand or when they misunderstood either he would have been silent most of the time in company or his conversation would have been as petty and narrow and devoid of originality or imagination as is the mentality of most human beings as is the talk and reading that impress them as interestingand profound
The American man of the more ambitious sort he went on either has to live practically if not physically apart from his wife or else has to educate some not too difficult woman to be his wife
She understood that
You are really going to educate me
she said with an arch smile
Now that Norman had her attention now that she was centering upon him instead of upon herself she was interested in him and in what he said whether she understood it or not whether it pleased her vanity or wounded it
The intellects of women work to an unsuspected extent only through the sex charm
Their appreciations of books of art of men are dependant often in the most curious indirect ways upon the fact that the author the artist the politician or what not is betrousered
Thus Dorothy was patient respectful attentive was not offended by Normans didactic way of giving her the lessons in life
Her smile was happy as well as coquettish as she asked him to educate her
He returned her smile
That depends answered he
Youre not sure Im worth the trouble
You may put it that way if you like
But Id say rather Im not sure I can spare the timeand youre not sure you care to fit yourself for the place
Oh but I do
cried she
Well seein a few weeks or months replied he
The Burroughs party were rising
Josephine had choice of two ways to the door
She chose the one that took her past Norman and his bride
She advanced beaming
Norman rose took her extended hand
Said she So glad to see you
Then turning the radiant smile upon Dorothy And is this your wife
Is this the pretty little typewriter girl
Dorothy noddeda charming ingenuous bend of the head
Norman felt a thrill of pride in her so beautifully unconscious of the treacherous attempt at insult
It particularly delighted him that she had not made the mistake of rising to return Josephines greeting but had remained seated
Surely this wife of his had the right instincts that never fail to cause right manners
For Josephines benefit he gazed down at Dorothy with the proudest fondest eyes
Yesthis is she said he
Can you blame me
Josephine paled and winced visibly as if the blow she had aimed at him had after glancing off harmlessly returned to crush her
She touched Dorothys proffered hand murmured a few stammering phrases of vague compliment rejoined her friends
Said Dorothy when she and Norman were settled again I shall never like her
Nor she me
But you do like this cheese
Waiter another bottle of that same
Why did she put you in such a good humor
inquired his wife
It wasnt she
It was you
replied he
But he refused to explain
XXI GALLOWAY accepted Normans terms
He would probably have accepted terms far less easy
But Norman as yet knew with the thoroughness which must precede intelligent plan and action only the legal side of financial operations he had been as indifferent to the commercial side as a pilot to the value of the cargo in the ship he engages to steer clear of shoals and rocks
So with the prudence of the sagacious mans audacities he contented himself with a share of this first venture that would simply make a comfortable foundation for the fortune he purposed to build
As the venture could not fail outright even should Galloway die he rented a largish place at Hempstead with the privilege of purchase and installed his wife and himself with a dozen servants and a housekeeper
This housekeeper this Mrs Lowell said he to Dorothy is a good enough person as housekeepers go
But you will have to look sharply after her
Dorothy seemed to fade and shrink within herself which was her way of confessing lack of courage and fitness to face a situation I dont know anything about those things she confessed
I understand perfectly said he
But you learned something at the place in Jersey Cityquite enough for the start
Really all you need to know just now is whether the place is clean or not and whether the food comes on the table in proper condition
The rest youll pick up gradually
I hope so said she looking doubtful and helpless these new magnitudes were appalling especially now that she was beginning to get a point of view upon life
At any rate dont bother me for these few next months said he
Im going to be very busyshall leave early in the morning and not be back until near dinner timeif I come at all
No youll not be annoyed by me
Youll be absolute mistress of your time
She tried to look as if this contented her
But he could not have failed to see how dissatisfied and disquieted she really was
He had the best of reasons for thinking that she was living under the same roof with him only because she preferred the roof he could provide to such a one as she could provide for herself whether by her own earnings or by marrying a man more to her liking personally
Yet here she was piqued and depressed because of his indifferencebecause he was not thrusting upon her gallantries she would tolerate only through prudence
You will be lonely at times Im afraid said he
But I cant provide friends or even acquaintances for you for several monthsuntil my affairs are in better order and my sister and her husband come back from Europe
Oh I shant be lonely cried she
Ive never cared for people
Youve your books and your musicand riding and shopping trips to townand the house and grounds to look after
Yesand my dreams said she hopefully her eyes suggesting the dusky star depths
Ohthe dreams
Youll have little time for them said he drily
And little inclination I imagine as you wake up to the sense of how much there is to be learned
Dreaming is the pastime of people who havent the intelligence or the energy to accomplish anything
If you wish to please meand you dodont you
Yes she murmured
She forced her rebellious lips to the laconic assent
She drooped the lids over her rebellious eyes lest he should detect her wounded feelings and her resentment
I assumed so said he with a secret smile
Well if you wish to please me youll give your time to practical thingsthings thatll make you more interesting and make us both more comfortable
It was all very well to dream while you had little to do and small opportunity
But now Try to cut it out
It is painful to an American girl of any class to find that she has to earn her position as wife
The current theory a tradition from an early and woman revering day is that the girl has done her share and more when she has consented to the suit of the ardent male and has intrusted her priceless charms to his exclusive keeping
According to that same theory it is the husband who must earn his positionmust continue to earn it
He is a humble creature honored by the presence of a wonderful being a cross between a queen and a goddess
He cannot do enough to show his gratitude
Perhapsbut only perhapshad Norman married Josephine Burroughs he might have assented after a fashion to this idea of the relations of the man and the woman
No doubt had he remained under the spell of Dorothys mystery and beauty he would have felt and acted the slave he had made of himself at the outset
But in the circumstances he was looking at their prospective life together with sane eyes
And so she had in addition to all her other reasons for heartache a sense that she the goddessqueen the American woman with the birthright of dominion over the male was being cheated humbled degraded
At first he saw that this sense of being wronged made it impossible for her to do anything at all toward educating herself for her position
But time brought about the change he had hoped for
A few weeks and she began to cheer up almost in spite of herself
What was the use in sulking or sighing or in selfpitying when it brought only unhappiness to oneself
The coarse and brutal male in the case was either unaware or indifferent
There was no one and no place to fly tounless she wished to be much worse off than her darkest mood of selfpity represented her to her sorrowing self
The housekeeper Mrs Lowell was a broken down gentlewoman who had been chastened by misfortune into a wholesome state of practical good sense about the relative values of the real and the romantic
Mrs Lowell diagnosed the case of the young wifeas Norman had shrewdly guessed she would and was soon adroitly showing her the many advantages of her lot
Before they had been three months at Hempstead Dorothy had discovered that she in fact was without a single ground for serious complaint
She had a husband who was generous about money and left her as absolutely alone as if he were mere occasional visitor at the house
She had her livingand such a livingshe had plenty of interesting occupationshe had not a single sordid careand perfect health
The dreams too It was curious about those dreams
She would now have found it an intolerable bore to sit with hands idle in her lap and eyes upon vacancy watching the dim luminous shadows flit aimlessly by
Yet that was the way she used to pass hoursentire days
She used to fight off sleep at night the longer to enjoy her one source of pure happiness
There was no doubt about it the fire of romance was burning low and she was becoming commonplace practical resigned
Well why not
Was not life over for herthat is the life a girls fancy longs for
In place of hope of romance there was an uneasy feeling of a necessity of pleasing this husband of hersof making him comfortable
What would befall her if she neglected trying to please him or if she for all her trying failed
She did not look far in that direction
Her uneasiness remained indefiniteyet definite enough to keep her working from waking until bedtime
And she dropped into the habit of watching his face with the same anxiety with which a farmer watches the weather
When he happened one day to make a careless absentminded remark in disapproval of something in the domestic arrangements she was thrown into such a nervous flutter that he observed it
What is it
he asked
Nothingnothing replied she in the hurried tone of one who is trying hastily to cover his thoughts
He reflected understood burst into a fit of hearty laughter
So you are trying to make a bogey of me
She colored protested faintly
Dont you know Im about the least tyrannical least exacting person in the world
Youve been very patient with me said she
Nownow cried he in a tone of raillery you might as well drop that
Dont you know theres no reason for being afraid of me
Yes I KNOW it replied she
But I FEEL afraid just the same
I cant help it
It was impossible for him to appreciate the effect of his personality upon othershow without his trying or even wishing it made them dread a purely imaginary displeasure and its absurdly imaginary consequences
But this confession of hers was not the first time he had heard of the effect of potential and latent danger he had upon those associated with him
And as it was most useful he was not sorry that he had it
He made no further attempt to convince her that he was harmless
He knew that he was harmless where she was concerned
Was it not just as well that she should not know it when vaguely dreading him was producing excellent results
As with a Christian the fear of the Lord was the beginning of wisdom so with a wife the fear of her husband was the beginning of wisdom
In striving to please him to fit herself for the position of wife she was using up the time she would otherwise have spent in making herself miserable with selfpitythat supreme curse of the idle both male and female that most prolific of the breeders of unhappy wives
Yes wives were unhappy not because their husbands neglected them for busy people have no time to note whether they are neglected or not but because they gave their own worthless negligent incapable selves too much attention
One evening she wearing the look of the timid but resolute intruder came into his room while he was dressing for dinner and hung about with an air no man of his experience could fail to understand
Something wrong about the house
said he finally
Need more money
Nonothing she replied with a slight flush
He saw that she was mustering all her courage for some grand effort
He waited only mildly curious as his mind was busy with some new business he and Tetlow had undertaken
Presently she stood squarely before him her hands behind her back and her face up turned
Wont you kiss me
she said
Sure
said he
And he kissed her on the cheek and resumed operations with his military brushes
I didnt mean thatthat kind of a kiss said she dejectedly
He paused with a quick characteristic turn of the head looked keenly at her resumed his brushing
A quizzical smile played over his face
Oh I see said he
Youve been thinking about duty
And youve decided to do yours



Eh
I think It seems to me I dont think she stammered then said desperately Ive not been acting right by you
I want toto do better
Thats good said he briskly with a nod of approvaland never a glance in her direction
You think youll let me have a kiss now and theneh
All right my dear
Oh you WONT understand me
she cried ready to weep with vexation
You mean I wont misunderstand you replied he amiably as he set about fixing his tie
Youve been mulling things over in your mind
Youve decided Im secretly pining for you
Youve resolved to be good and kind and dutifulgenerousto feed old dog Tray a few crumbs now and then



Thats nice and sweet of you He paused until the crisis in tying was passedvery nice and sweet of youbut Theres nothing in it
All I ask of you for myself is to see that Im comfortablethat Mrs Lowell and the servants treat me right
If I dont like anything Ill speak outnever fear
ButFredI want to be your wifeI really do she pleaded
He turned on her and his eyes seemed to pierce into the chamber of her thoughts
Drop it my dear he said quietly
Neither of us is in love with the other
So theres not the slightest reason for pretending
If I ever want to be free of you Ill tell you so
If you ever want to get rid of me all you have to do is to askand itll be arranged
Meanwhile lets enjoy ourselves
His good humor obviously unfeigned would have completely discouraged a more experienced woman though as vain as Dorothy and with as much ground as he had given her for selfconfidence where he was concerned
But Dorothy was depressed rather than profoundly discouraged
A few moments and she found courage to plead But you used to care for me
Dont I attract you any more
You say that quite pathetically said he in good humored amusement
Im willing to do anything within reason for your happiness
But reallyjust to please your vanity I cant make myself over again into the fool I used to be about you
Youd hate it yourself
Why then this pathetic air
I feel so uselessand as if I were shirking she persisted
And if you did care for me it wouldnt offend me now as it used to
Ive grown much wiser more sensible
I understand thingsand I look at them differently
AndI always did LIKE you
Even when you despised me
mocked he
It irritated him a little vividly to recall what a consummate fool he had made of himself for her even though he had every reason to be content with the event of his folly
A girl always thinks she despises a man when she can do as she pleases with him replied she
As Mr Tetlow said I was a fool
I was the fool said he
Where did that man of mine lay the handkerchief
I too cried she eagerly
You were foolish to bother about a little silly like me
But oh what a FOOL I was not to realize Youre not trying to tell me youre in love with me
said he sharply
Oh nono indeed she protested in haste alarmed by his overwhelming manner
Im not trying to deceive you in any way
Never do said he
Its the one thing I cant stand
But I thoughtit seemed to me she persisted that perhaps if we tried toto care for each other wed maybe get toto caringmore or less
Dont you think so
Perhaps was his careless reply
He added But I for one am well content with things as they are
I confess I dont look back with any satisfaction on those months when I was making an ass of myself about you
I was ruining my career
Now Im happy and everything is going fine in my business
No experiments if you please
He shook his head looking at her with smiling raillery
It might turn out that Id care for you in the same crazy way again and that you didnt like it
Again you might get excited about me and Id remain calm about you
That would give me a handsome revenge but Im not looking for revenge
He finished his toilet she standing quiet and thoughtful in an attitude of unconscious grace
No my dear resumed he as he prepared to descend for dinner lets have a peaceful cheerful mar ried life with no crazy excitements
Lets hang on to what weve got and take no unnecessary risks
He patted her on the shoulder
Isnt that sensible
She looked at him with serious appealing eyes
You are SURE you arent unhappy
It was amusing to himthough he concealed it to see how tenaciously her feminine egotism held to the idea that she was the important person
And when women of experience thus deluded themselves it was not at all strange that this girl should be unable to grasp the essential truth as to the relations of men and womenthat while a woman who makes her sex her profession must give to a man to some man a dominant place in her life a man need give a womanat least any one womanlittle or no place
But he would not wantonly wound her harmless vanity
Dont worry about me please said he in the kindest friendliest way
I am telling you the truth
And they descended to the dining room
Usually he was preoccupied and she did most of the talking not a difficult matter for her as she was one of those who by nature have much to say who talk on and on giving lively pleasant recitals of commonplace daily happenings
That evening it was her turn to be abstracted or at least silent
He talked volubly torrentially like a man of teeming mind in the highest spirits
And he was in high spirits
The Galloway enterprise had developed into a huge success also it did not lessen his sense of the pleasantness of life to have learned that his wife was feeling about as well disposed toward him as he cared to have her feel had come round to that state of mind which he as a practical man wise in the art of life regarded as ideal for a wife
A successful man with a quiet and comfortable home well enough looked after by an agreeable wife exceeding good to look at and interested only in her home and her husbandwhat more could a man ask
What more could a man ask
Only one thing more a baby
The months soon passed and that rounding out of the home side of his life was consummated with no mishap
The baby was a girl which contented him and delighted Dorothy
He wished it to be named after her she preferred his sisters nameUrsula
It was Ursula who decided the question
She looks like you Fred she declared after an earnest scanning of the wierd little face
Why not call her Frederica
Norman thought this clumsy but Dorothy instantly assentedand the baby was duly christened Frederica
Perhaps it was because he was having less pressing business in town but whatever the reason he began to stay at home moresurprisingly more
And being at home he naturally fell into the habit of fussing with the baby he having the temperament that compels a man to be always at something and the baby being convenient and in the nature of a curiosity
Ursula who was stopping in the house did not try to conceal her amazement at this extraordinary development of her brothers character
Said she I never before knew you to take the slightest interest in a child
Said he I never before saw a child worth taking the slightest interest in
Oh well said Ursula it wont last
Youll soon grow tired of your plaything
Perhaps youre right said Norman
I hope youre wrong
He reflected added In fact Im almost certain youre wrong
Im too selfish to let myself lose such a pleasure
If you had observed my life closely youd have discovered that I have never given up a single thing I found a source of pleasure
That is good sense
That is why the superior sort of men and women retain something of the boy and the girl all their lives
I still like a lot of the games I played as a boy
For some years Ive had no chance to indulge in them
Ill be glad when Rica is old enough to give me the chance again
She was much amused
Whod have suspected that YOU were a born father 
Not I for one confessed he
We never know what there is in us until circumstances bring it out
A devoted father and a doting husband pursued Ursula
I must say I rather sympathize with you as a doting husband
Of course I a woman cant see her as you do
I cant imagine a manespecially a man of your sortgoing stark mad about a mere woman
But as women go Ill admit she is a good specimen
Not the marvel of intelligence and complex character you imagine but still a good specimen
And physically She laughed THATS what caught you
Thats what holds youand will hold you as long as it lasts
Was there ever a woman who didnt think that and didnt like to think it though I believe many of them make strong pretense at scorning the physical
Fred was regarding his sister with a quizzical expression
You approve of her
he said
More than Id have thought possible
And after Ive taken her about in the world a while shell be perfect
No doubt said Norman
But alas shell never be perfect
For youre not going to take her about
So she says when I talk of it to her replied Ursula
But I know youll insist
You neednt be uneasy as to how shell be received
Im not said Norman dryly
Youve got back all you lostand more
How we Americans do worship success
Dont suggest to Dorothy anything further about society said Norman
Ive no time or taste for it and I dont wish to be annoyed by intrusions into my home
But youll not be satisfied always with just her urged his sister
Besides youve got a position to maintain
Normans smile was cynically patient
I want my home and I want my career said he
And I dont want any society nonsense
I had the good luck to marry a woman who knows and cares nothing about it
I dont purpose to give up the greatest advantage of my marriage
Ursula was astounded
She knew the meaning of his various tones and manners and his way of rejecting her plans for Dorothyand incidentally for her own amusementconvinced her that he was through and through in earnest
It will be dreadfully lonesome for her Fred she pleaded
Well wait till that trouble faces us replied he not a bit impressed
And dont forgetnot a word of temptation to her from you
This with an expression that warned her how well he knew her indirect ways of accomplishing what she could not gain directly
Oh I shant interfere said she in a tone that made it a binding promise
But you cant expect me to sympathize with your plans for an oldfashioned domestic life
Certainly not said Norman
You dont understand
Women of your sort never do
Thats why youre not fit to be the wives of men worth while
A serious man and a society woman cant possibly hit it off together
For a serious man the outside world is a place to work and home is a place to rest
For a society woman the world is a place to idle and home is a work shop an entertainment factory
Its impossible to reconcile those two opposite ideas
She saw his point at once and it appealed to her intelligence
And she had his own faculty for never permitting prejudice to influence judgment
She said in a dubious tone Do you think Dorothy will sympathize with your scheme
Im sure I dont know replied he
If she doesnt Ursula halted there
Her brother shrugged his shoulders
If she proves to be the wrong sort of woman for me shell go her way and I mine
Why I thought you loved her
What have I said that leads you to change your mind
said he
A man does not take the high hand with the woman he adores
So
said Norman tranquilly
Well said his puzzled sister by way of conclusion if you persist in being the autocrat AutocratI
laughed he
Am I trying to compel her to do anything she doesnt wish to do
Didnt I say she would be free to go if she were dissatis fied with me and my planif she didnt adopt it gladly as her own plan also
But you know very well shes dependent upon you Fred
Is that my fault
Does a man force a woman to become dependent
And just because she is dependent should he therefore yield to her and let her make of his life a waste and a folly
Youre far too clever for me to argue with
Anyhow as I was saying if you persist in what I call tyranny When a woman cries tyranny it means shes furious because she is not getting HER autocratic way
Maybe so admitted Ursula cheerfully
At any rate if you persistunless she loves you utterly your life will be miserable
She may make her own life miserable but not mine replied he
If I were the ordinary man counting himself lucky to have induced any woman to marry himafraid if he lost his woman hed not be able to get anotherable to give his woman only an indifferent poor support and so onif I were one of those men what you say might be true
But what deep and permanent mischief can a frail woman do a strong man
Theres instance after instance in history Of strong men wrecking THEMSELVES through various kinds of madness including sex madness
But my dear Ursula not an instancenot onewhere the woman was responsible
If history were truth instead of liesyou women might have less conceit
Youtalking this way
mocked Ursula
Meaning I suppose my late infatuation
inquired he unruffled
I never saw or read of a worse case
Am I ruined
No
But why not
Because you got her
If you hadnt Ursula blew out a large cloud of cigarette smoke with a Pouf
If I hadnt got her said Norman Id have got well just the same in due time
A sick WEAK man goes down a sick STRONG man gets well
When a man whos reputed to be strong doesnt get well its because he merely seemed strong but wasnt
The poets and novelists and the historians and the rest of the nature fakers fail to tell ALL the facts dear sister
All the facts would spoil a pretty story
Ursula thought a few minutes suddenly burst out with Do you think Dorothy loves you now
Norman rose to go out doors
I dont think about such unprofitable things said he
As long as we suit each other and get along pleasantlywhy bother about a name for it
In the French window he paused stood looking out with an expression so peculiar that Ursula curious came to see the cause
A few yards away under a big symmetrical maple in full leaf sat Dorothy with the baby on her lap
She was dressed very simply in white
There was a little sunlight upon her hair a sheen of gold over her skin
She was looking down at the baby
Her expression Said Ursula Several of the great painters have tried to catch that expression
But theyve failed
Norman made no reply
He had not heard
All in an instant there had been revealed to him a whole new worlda view of man and womanof woman of sexits meaning so different from what he had believed and lived
Whatre you thinking about Fred
inquired his sister
He shook his head with a mysterious smile and strolled away
XXII THE baby grew and thrived as the habit is with healthy children well taken care of
Mrs Norman soon got back her strength her figure and perhaps more than her former beautyas the habit is with healthy women well taken care of
Normans career continued to prosper likewise according to the habit of all healthy things well taken care of
In a world where nothing happens by chance mischance to be serious must have some grave fault as its hidden cause
We mortals who love to live at haphazard and to blame God or destiny or bad luck for our calamities hate to take this modern and scientific view of the world and life
But whether we like it or not it is the truthand as we cant get round it why not accept it cheerfully and so appear a little less ignorant and ridiculous
During their first year at the Hempstead place the results in luxury and comfort had at no time accounted for the money it cost and the servants it employed that is to say paid
But Norman was neither unreasonable nor impatient
Also in his years of experience with his sisters housekeeping and of observation of the other women he had grown exceedingly moderate in his estimate of the ability of women and in his expectations from them
He had reached the conclusion that the women who were sheltered and pampered by the men of the successful classes were proficient only in those things that call for no skill or effort beyond the wagging of the tongue
He saw that Dorothy was making honest endeavor to learn her business and he knew that learning takes timemuch time
He believed that in the end she would do better than any other wife of his acquaintance at the business of wife and mother
Before the baby was two years old his belief was rewarded
Things began to run betterbegan to run well even
Dorothya serious person unhampered of a keen sense of humor had taught herself the duties of her new position in much the same slow plodding way in which she had formerly made of herself a fair stenographer and a tolerable typewriter
Mrs Lowell had helpedand Ursula tooand Norman not a little
But Dorothy her husband discovered was one of those who thoroughly assimilate what they take inwho make it over into part of themselves
So her manner of keeping house of arranging the gardens of bringing up the baby of dressing herself was peculiarly her own
It was not by any means the best imaginable way
It was even what many energetic systematic and highly competent persons would speak contemptuously of
But it satisfied Normanand that was all Dorothy had in mind
If those who have had any considerable opportunity to observe married life will forget what they have read in novels and will fix their minds on what they have observed at first hand they will recognize the Norman marriage with the husband and wife living together yet apart as not peculiar but of a rather common type
Neither Fred nor Dorothy had any especial reason on any given day to try to alter their relations so the law of inertia asserted itself and matters continued as they had begun
It was perhaps a chance remark of Tetlows that was the remote but efficient cause of a change as the single small stone slipping high up on the mountain side results in a vast landslide into the valley miles below
Tetlow said one day in connection with some estate they were settling Ive always pitied the only child
It must be miserably lonesome
No sooner were the words out of his mouth than he colored violently for he remembered that the Normans had but one child and he knew the probable reason for it
Norman seemed not to have heard or seen
Tetlow hoped he hadnt but knowing the man feared otherwise
And he was right
In the press of other matters Norman forgot Tetlows remarkremembered it again a few days later when he was taking the baby out for an airing in the motorforgot it againfinally when he took a several days rest at home remembered it and kept it in mind
He began to think of Dorothy once more in a definite personal way began to observe her as his wife instead of as mere part of his establishment
An intellectual person she certainly was not
She had a quaint individual way of speaking and of acting
She had the marvelous changeable beauty that had once caused him to take the bit in his teeth and run wild
But he would no more think of talking with her about the affairs that really interested him thanwell than the other men of large career in his acquaintance would think of talking those matters to their wives
But He was astonished to discover that he liked this slim quiet unobtrusive little wife of his better than he liked anyone else in the world that he eagerly turned away from the clever and amusing companionship he might have at his clubs to come down to the country and be with her and the babynot the baby alone but her also
Why
He could not find a satisfactory reason
He saw that she created at that Hempstead place an atmosphere of rest of tranquility
But this merely thrust the mystery one step back
HOW did she create this atmosphereand for a man of his varied and discriminating tastes
To that question he could work out no answer
She had for him now a charm as different from the infatuation of former days as calm sea is from tempestracked seautterly different yet fully as potent
As he observed her and wondered at these discoveries of his the ghost of a delight he had thought forever dead stirred in his heart in his fancy
Yes it was a pleasure a thrilling pleasure to watch her
There was music in those quiet graceful movements of hers in that quiet sweet voice
Not the wild blood heating music of the former days but a kind far more melodioustender restful to nerves sorely tried by the tensions of ambition
He made some sort of an attempt to define his feeling for her but could not
It seemed to fit into none of the usual classifications
Then he wondered What is SHE thinking of ME
To find out he resorted to various elaborate round about methods that did credit to the ingenuity of his mind
But he made at every cunning cast a barren waterhaul
Either she was not thinking of him at all or what she thought swam too deep for any casts he knew how to make in those hidden and unfamiliar waters
Or perhaps she did not herself know what she thought being too busy with the baby and the household to have time for such abstract and not pressing perhaps not important matters
He moved slowly in his inquiries into her state of mind because there was all the time in the world and no occasion for haste
He moved cautiously because he wished to do nothing that might disturb the present serenity of their home life
Did she dislike him
Was she indifferent
Had she developed a habit of having him about that was in a way equivalent to liking
These languid but delightful investigationsnot unlike the pastimes one spins out when one has a long long lovely summer day with hours on hours for luxurious happy idlingthese investigations were abruptly suspended by a suddenly compelled trip to Europe
He arranged for Dorothy to send him a cable every dayabout yourself and the babyand he sent an occasional cabled bulletin about himself in reply
But neither wrote to the other their relationship was not of the letterexchanging kindand had no need of pretense at what it was not
In the third month of his absence his sister Ursula came over for dresses millinery and truly aristocratic society
She had little time for him or he for her but they happened to lunch alone about a week after his arrival
Youre looking cross and unhappy said she
Whats the matter
Business
Noeverythings going well
Same thing thats troubling Dorothy then
Is Dorothy ill
inquired he suddenly as alert as he had been absent
She hasnt let me know anything about it
Ill
Of course not reassured Ursula
Shes never ill
ButIve not anywhere or ever seen two people as crazy about each other as you and she
Really
Norman had relapsed into interest in what he was eating
You live all alone down there in the country
You treat anyone who comes to see you as intruder
And as soon as darling husband goes away darling wife wanders about like a damned soul
Honestly it gave me the blues to look at her eyes
And I used to think she cared more about the baby than about you
Shes probably worried about something else said Norman
More salad
No
Theres no dessert at least Ive ordered none
But if youd like some strawberries I thought of that replied Ursula not to be deflected
I mean of her being upset about something beside you
Im slow to suspect anyone of really caring about any ONE else
But although she didnt confess I soon saw that it was your absence
And she wasnt putting on for my benefit either
My maid hears the same thing from all the servants
This is pleasant said Norman in his mocking goodhumored way
And youre in the same state she charged with laughing but sympathetic eyes
Why Fred youre as madly in love with her as ever
I wonder said he reflectively
Why didnt you bring her with you
He stared at his sister like a man who has just discovered that he with incredible stupidity had over looked the obvious
I didnt think Id be away long evaded he
He saw Ursula off for the Continent half promised to join her in a few weeks at Aix
A day or so after her departure he had a violent fit of blues was haunted by a vision of the baby and the comfortable peaceful house on Long Island
He had expected to stay about two months longer
Im sick of England and of hotels he said and closed up his business and sailed the following week
She and the baby were at the pier to meet him
He looked for signs of the mourning Ursula had described but he looked in vain
Never had he seen her lovelier or so sparkling
And how she did talkrattling on and on with those interesting commonplaces of domestic eventthe baby the household the garden the baby the horses the dogs the babythe servants her new dresses the babyand so on and so onand the baby
But when they got into the motor at Hempstead station for the drive home silence fell upon herhe had been almost silent from the start of the little journey
As the motor swung into the grounds looking their most beautiful for his homecoming an enormous wave of pure delight began to surge up in him to swell to rush to break dashing its spray of tears into his eyes
He turned his head away to hide the too obvious display of feeling
They went into the house he carrying the baby
He gave it to the nurseand he and she were alone
It certainly is good to be home again he said
The words were the tamest commonplace
We always speak in the old stereotyped commonplaces when we speak directly from the heart
His tone made her glance quickly at him
Why I believe you ARE glad said she
He took her hand
They looked at each other
Suddenly she flung herself wildly into his arms and clung to him in an agony of joy and fear
Oh I missed you so
she sobbed
I missed you so
It was frightful said he
It shall never happen again
