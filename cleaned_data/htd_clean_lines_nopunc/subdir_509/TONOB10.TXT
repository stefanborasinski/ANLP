TONOBUNGAY by HG Wells BOOK THE FIRST THE DAYS BEFORE TONOBUNGAY WAS INVENTED CHAPTER THE FIRST OF BLADESOVER HOUSE AND MY MOTHER AND THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY I Most people in this world seem to live in character they have a beginning a middle and an end and the three are congruous one with another and true to the rules of their type
You can speak of them as being of this sort of people or that
They are as theatrical people say no more and no less than character actors
They have a class they have a place they know what is becoming in them and what is due to them and their proper size of tombstone tells at last how properly they have played the part
But there is also another kind of life that is not so much living as a miscellaneous tasting of life
One gets hit by some unusual transverse force one is jerked out of ones stratum and lives crosswise for the rest of the time and as it were in a succession of samples
That has been my lot and that is what has set me at last writing something in the nature of a novel
I have got an unusual series of impressions that I want very urgently to tell
I have seen life at very different levels and at all these levels I have seen it with a sort of intimacy and in good faith
I have been a native in many social countries
I have been the unwelcome guest of a working baker my cousin who has since died in the Chatham infirmary I have eaten illegal snacksthe unjustifiable gifts of footmenin pantries and been despised for my want of style and subsequently married and divorced by the daughter of a gasworks clerk andto go to my other extremeI was onceoh glittering daysan item in the houseparty of a countess
She was I admit a countess with a financial aspect but still you know a countess
Ive seen these people at various angles
At the dinnertable Ive met not simply the titled but the great
On one occasionit is my brightest memoryI upset my champagne over the trousers of the greatest statesman in the empireHeaven forbid I should be so invidious as to name himin the warmth of our mutual admiration
And once though it is the most incidental thing in my life I murdered a man
Yes Ive seen a curious variety of people and ways of living altogether
Odd people they all are great and small very much alike at bottom and curiously different on their surfaces
I wish I had ranged just a little further both up and down seeing I have ranged so far
Royalty must be worth knowing and very great fun
But my contacts with princes have been limited to quite public occasions nor at the other end of the scale have I had what I should call an inside acquaintance with that dusty but attractive class of people who go about on the highroads drunk but enfamille so redeeming the minor lapse in the summertime with a perambulator lavender to sell sunbrown children a smell and ambiguous bundles that fire the imagination
Navvies farmlabourers sailormen and stokers all such as sit in 1834 beerhouses are beyond me also and I suppose must remain so now for ever
My intercourse with the ducal rank too has been negligible I once went shooting with a duke and in an outburst of what was no doubt snobbishness did my best to get him in the legs
But that failed
Im sorry I havent done the whole lot though You will ask by what merit I achieved this remarkable social range this extensive crosssection of the British social organism
It was the Accident of Birth
It always is in England
Indeed if I may make the remark so cosmic everything is
But that is by the way
I was my uncles nephew and my uncle was no less a person than Edward Ponderevo whose cometlike transit of the financial heavens happenedit is now ten years ago
Do you remember the days of Ponderevo the great days I mean of Ponderevo
Perhaps you had a trifle in some worldshaking enterprise
Then you know him only too well
Astraddle on TonoBungay he flashed athwart the empty heavenslike a cometrather like a stupendous rocketand overawed investors spoke of his star
At his zenith he burst into a cloud of the most magnificent promotions
What a time that was
The Napoleon of domestic conveniences
I was his nephew his peculiar and intimate nephew
I was hanging on to his coattails all the way through
I made pills with him in the chemists shop at Wimblehurst before he began
I was you might say the stick of his rocket and after our tremendous soar after he had played with millions a golden rain in the sky after my birdseye view of the modern world I fell again a little scarred and blistered perhaps two and twenty years older with my youth gone my manhood eaten in upon but greatly edified into this Thamesside yard into these white heats and hammerings amidst the fine realites of steelto think it all over in my leisure and jot down the notes and inconsecutive observations that make this book
It was more you know than a figurative soar
The zenith of that career was surely our flight across the channel in the Lord Roberts B
I warn you this book is going to be something of an agglomeration
I want to trace my social trajectory and my uncles as the main line of my story but as this is my first novel and almost certainly my last I want to get in too all sorts of things that struck me things that amused me and impressions I goteven although they dont minister directly to my narrative at all
I want to set out my own queer love experiences too such as they are for they troubled and distressed and swayed me hugely and they still seem to me to contain all sorts of irrational and debatable elements that I shall be the clearerheaded for getting on paper
And possibly I may even flow into descriptions of people who are really no more than people seen in transit just because it amuses me to recall what they said and did to us and more particularly how they behaved in the brief but splendid glare of TonoBungay and its still more glaring offspring
It lit some of them up I can assure you
Indeed I want to get in all sorts of things
My ideas of a novel all through are comprehensive rather than austere TonoBungay still figures on the hoardings it stands in rows in every chemists storeroom it still assuages the coughs of age and brightens the elderly eye and loosens the elderly tongue but its social glory its financial illumination have faded from the world for ever
And I sole scorched survivor from the blaze sit writing of it here in an air that is never still for the clang and thunder of machines on a table littered with working drawings and amid fragments of models and notes about velocities and air and water pressures and trajectoriesof an altogether different sort from that of TonoBungay
II I write that much and look at it and wonder whether after all this is any fair statement of what I am attempting in this book
Ive given I see an impression that I want to make simply a hotchpotch of anecdotes and experiences with my uncle swimming in the middle as the largest lump of victual
Ill own that here with the pen already started I realise what a fermenting mass of things learnt and emotions experienced and theories formed Ive got to deal with and how in a sense hopeless my book must be from the very outset
I suppose what Im really trying to render is nothing more nor less than Lifeas one man has found it
I want to tellMYSELF and my impressions of the thing as a whole to say things I have come to feel intensely of the laws traditions usages and ideas we call society and how we poor individuals get driven and lured and stranded among these windy perplexing shoals and channels
Ive got I suppose to a time of life when things begin to take on shapes that have an air of reality and become no longer material for dreaming but interesting in themselves
Ive reached the criticising novelwriting age and here I am writing minemy one novelwithout having any of the discipline to refrain and omit that I suppose the regular novelwriter acquires
Ive read an average share of novels and made some starts before this beginning and Ive found the restraints and rules of the art as I made them out impossible for me
I like to write I am keenly interested in writing but it is not my technique
Im an engineer with a patent or two and a set of ideas most of whatever artist there is in me has been given to turbine machines and boat building and the problem of flying and do what I will I fail to see how I can be other than a lax undisciplined storyteller
I must sprawl and flounder comment and theorise if I am to get the thing out I have in mind
And it isnt a constructed tale I have to tell but unmanageable realities
My lovestoryand if only I can keep up the spirit of truthtelling all through as strongly as I have now you shall have it allfalls into no sort of neat scheme of telling
It involves three separate feminine persons
Its all mixed up with the other things
But Ive said enough I hope to excuse myself for the method or want of method in what follows and I think I had better tell without further delay of my boyhood and my early impressions in the shadow of Bladesover House
III There came a time when I realised that Bladesover House was not all it seemed but when I was a little boy I took the place with the entirest faith as a complete authentic microcosm
I believed that the Bladesover system was a little workingmodeland not so very little eitherof the whole world
Let me try and give you the effect of it
Bladesover lies up on the Kentish Downs eight miles perhaps from Ashborough and its old pavilion a little wooden parody of the temple of Vesta at Tibur upon the hill crest behind the house commands in theory at least a view of either sea of the Channel southward and the Thames to the northeast
The park is the second largest in Kent finely wooded with wellplaced beeches many elms and some sweet chestnuts abounding in little valleys and hollows of bracken with springs and a stream and three fine ponds and multitudes of fallow deer
The house was built in the eighteenth century it is of pale red brick in the style of a French chateau and save for one pass among the crests which opens to blue distances to minute remote oastset farmhouses and copses and wheat fields and the occasional gleam of water its hundred and seventeen windows look on nothing but its own wide and handsome territories
A semicircular screen of great beeches masks the church and village which cluster picturesquely about the high road along the skirts of the great park
Northward at the remotest corner of that enclosure is a second dependent village Ropedean less fortunate in its greater distance and also on account of a rector
This divine was indeed rich but he was vindictively economical because of some shrinkage of his tithes and by reason of his use of the word Eucharist for the Lords Supper he had become altogether estranged from the great ladies of Bladesover
So that Ropedean was in the shadows through all that youthful time
Now the unavoidable suggestion of that wide park and that fair large house dominating church village and the country side was that they represented the thing that mattered supremely in the world and that all other things had significance only in relation to them
They represented the Gentry the Quality by and through and for whom the rest of the world the farming folk and the labouring folk the tradespeople of Ashborough and the upper servants and the lower servants and the servants of the estate breathed and lived and were permitted
And the Quality did it so quietly and thoroughly the great house mingled so solidly and effectually earth and sky the contrast of its spacious hall and saloon and galleries its airy housekeepers room and warren of offices with the meagre dignities of the vicar and the pinched and stuffy rooms of even the postoffice people and the grocer so enforced these suggestions that it was only when I was a boy of thirteen or fourteen and some queer inherited strain of scepticism had set me doubting whether Mr Bartlett the vicar did really know with certainty all about God that as a further and deeper step in doubting I began to question the final rightness of the gentlefolks their primary necessity in the scheme of things
But once that scepticism had awakened it took me fast and far
By fourteen I had achieved terrible blasphemies and sacrilege I had resolved to marry a viscounts daughter and I had blacked the left eyeI think it was the leftof her halfbrother in open and declared rebellion
But of that in its place
The great house the church the village and the labourers and the servants in their stations and degrees seemed to me I say to be a closed and complete social system
About us were other villages and great estates and from house to house interlacing correlated the Gentry the fine Olympians came and went
The country towns seemed mere collections of ships marketing places for the tenantry centres for such education as they needed as entirely dependent on the gentry as the village and scarcely less directly so
I thought this was the order of the whole world
I thought London was only a greater country town where the gentlefolk kept townhouses and did their greater shopping under the magnificent shadow of the greatest of all fine gentlewomen the Queen
It seemed to be in the divine order
That all this fine appearance was already sapped that there were forces at work that might presently carry all this elaborate social system in which my mother instructed me so carefully that I might understand my place to Limbo had scarcely dawned upon me even by the time that TonoBungay was fairly launched upon the world
There are many people in England today upon whom it has not yet dawned
There are times when I doubt whether any but a very inconsiderable minority of English people realise how extensively this ostensible order has even now passed away
The great houses stand in the parks still the cottages cluster respectfully on their borders touching their eaves with their creepers the English countrysideyou can range through Kent from Bladesover northward and see persists obstinately in looking what it was
It is like an early day in a fine October
The hand of change rests on it all unfelt unseen resting for awhile as it were half reluctantly before it grips and ends the thing for ever
One frost and the whole face of things will be bare links snap patience end our fine foliage of pretences lie glowing in the mire
For that we have still to wait a little while
The new order may have gone far towards shaping itself but just as in that sort of lantern show that used to be known in the village as the Dissolving Views the scene that is going remains upon the mind traceable and evident and the newer picture is yet enigmatical long after the lines that are to replace those former ones have grown bright and strong so that the new England of our childrens children is still a riddle to me
The ideas of democracy of equality and above all of promiscuous fraternity have certainly never really entered into the English mind
But what IS coming into it
All this book I hope will bear a little on that
Our people never formulates it keeps words for jests and ironies
In the meanwhile the old shapes the old attitudes remain subtly changed and changing still sheltering strange tenants
Bladesover House is now let furnished to Sir Reuben Lichtenstein and has been since old Lady Drew died it was my odd experience to visit there in the house of which my mother had been housekeeper when my uncle was at the climax of TonoBungay
It was curious to notice then the little differences that had come to things with this substitution
To borrow an image from my mineralogical days these Jews were not so much a new British gentry as pseudomorphous after the gentry
They are a very clever people the Jews but not clever enough to suppress their cleverness
I wished I could have gone downstairs to savour the tone of the pantry
It would have been very different I know
Hawksnest over beyond I noted had its pseudomorph too a newspaper proprietor of the type that hustles along with stolen ideas from one loud sinkorswim enterprise to another had bought the place outright Redgrave was in the hands of brewers
But the people in the villages so far as I could detect saw no difference in their world
Two little girls bobbed and an old labourer touched his hat convulsively as I walked through the village
He still thought he knew his placeand mine
I did not know him but I would have liked dearly to have asked him if he remembered my mother if either my uncle or old Lichtenstein had been man enough to stand being given away like that
In that English countryside of my boyhood every human being had a place
It belonged to you from your birth like the colour of your eyes it was inextricably your destiny
Above you were your betters below you were your inferiors and there were even an unstable questionable few cases so disputable that you might for the rough purposes of every day at least regard them as your equals
Head and centre of our system was Lady Drew her leddyship shrivelled garrulous with a wonderful memory for genealogies and very very old and beside her and nearly as old Miss Somerville her cousin and companion
These two old souls lived like driedup kernels in the great shell of Bladesover House the shell that had once been gaily full of fops of fine ladies in powder and patches and courtly gentlemen with swords and when there was no company they spent whole days in the corner parlour just over the housekeepers room between reading and slumber and caressing their two pet dogs
When I was a boy I used always to think of these two poor old creatures as superior beings living like God somewhere through the ceiling
Occasionally they bumped about a bit and one even heard them overhead which gave them a greater effect of reality without mitigating their vertical predominance
Sometimes too I saw them
Of course if I came upon them in the park or in the shrubbery where I was a trespasser I hid or fled in pious horror but I was upon due occasion taken into the Presence by request
I remember her leddyship then as a thing of black silks and a golden chain a quavering injunction to me to be a good boy a very shrunken looseskinned face and neck and a ropy hand that trembled a halfcrown into mine
Miss Somerville hovered behind a paler thing of broken lavender and white and black with screwed up sandylashed eyes
Her hair was yellow and her colour bright and when we sat in the housekeepers room of a winters night warming our toes and sipping elder wine her maid would tell us the simple secrets of that belated flush After my fight with young Garvell I was of course banished and I never saw those poor old painted goddesses again
Then there came and went on these floors over our respectful heads the Company people I rarely saw but whose tricks and manners were imitated and discussed by their maids and valets in the housekeepers room and the stewards roomso that I had them through a medium at second hand
I gathered that none of the company were really Lady Drews equals they were greater and lesser after the manner of all things in our world
Once I remember there was a Prince with a real live gentleman in attendance and that was a little above our customary levels and excited us all and perhaps raised our expectations unduly
Afterwards Rabbits the butler came into my mothers room downstairs red with indignation and with tears in his eyes
Look at that
gasped Rabbits
My mother was speechless with horror
That was a sovereign a mere sovereign such as you might get from any commoner
After Company I remember came anxious days for the poor old women upstairs were left tired and cross and vindictive and in a state of physical and emotional indigestion after their social efforts On the lowest fringe of these real Olympians hung the vicarage people and next to them came those ambiguous beings who are neither quality nor subjects
The vicarage people certainly hold a place by themselves in the typical English scheme nothing is more remarkable than the progress the Church has madesociallyin the last two hundred years
In the early eighteenth century the vicar was rather under than over the housesteward and was deemed a fitting match for the housekeeper or any not too morally discredited discard
The eighteenth century literature is full of his complaints that he might not remain at table to share the pie
He rose above these indignities because of the abundance of younger sons
When I meet the large assumptions of the contemporary cleric I am apt to think of these things
It is curious to note that today that downtrodden organplaying creature the Church of England village Schoolmaster holds much the same position as the seventeenth century parson
The doctor in Bladesover ranked below the vicar but above the vet artists and summer visitors squeezed in above or below this point according to their appearance and expenditure and then in a carefully arranged scale came the tenantry the butler and housekeeper the village shopkeeper the head keeper the cook the publican the second keeper the blacksmith whose status was complicated by his daughter keeping the postofficeand a fine hash she used to make of telegrams too
the village shopkeepers eldest son the first footman younger sons of the village shopkeeper his first assistant and so forth
All these conceptions and applications of a universal precedence and much else I drank in at Bladesover as I listened to the talk of valets ladiesmaids Rabbits the butler and my mother in the muchcupboarded whitepainted chintzbrightened housekeepers room where the upper servants assembled or of footmen and Rabbits and estate men of all sorts among the green baize and Windsor chairs of the pantrywhere Rabbits being above the law sold beer without a license or any compunctionor of housemaids and stillroom maids in the bleak mattingcarpeted stillroom or of the cook and her kitchen maids and casual friends among the bright copper and hot glow of the kitchens
Of course their own ranks and places came by implication to these people and it was with the ranks and places of the Olympians that the talk mainly concerned itself
There was an old peerage and a Crockford together with the books of recipes the Whitakers Almanack the Old Moores Almanack and the eighteenth century dictionary on the little dresser that broke the cupboards on one side of my mothers room there was another peerage with the covers off in the pantry there was a new peerage in the billiardroom and I seem to remember another in the anomalous apartment that held the upper servants bagatelle board and in which after the Hall dinner they partook of the luxury of sweets
And if you had asked any of those upper servants how such and such a Prince of Battenberg was related to let us say Mr Cunninghame Graham or the Duke of Argyle you would have been told upon the nail
As a boy I heard a great deal of that sort of thing and if to this day I am still a little vague about courtesy titles and the exact application of honorifics it is I can assure you because I hardened my heart and not from any lack of adequate opportunity of mastering these succulent particulars
Dominating all these memories is the figure of my mothermy mother who did not love me because I grew liker my father every dayand who knew with inflexible decision her place and the place of every one in the worldexcept the place that concealed my fatherand in some details mine
Subtle points were put to her
I can see and hear her saying now No Miss Fison peers of England go in before peers of the United Kingdom and he is merely a peer of the United Kingdom
She had much exercise in placing peoples servants about her teatable where the etiquette was very strict
I wonder sometimes if the etiquette of housekeepers rooms is as strict today and what my mother would have made of a chauffeur On the whole I am glad that I saw so much as I did of Bladesoverif for no other reason than because seeing it when I did quite naively believing in it thoroughly and then coming to analyse it has enabled me to understand much that would be absolutely incomprehensible in the structure of English society
Bladesover is I am convinced the clue to almost all that is distinctively British and perplexing to the foreign inquirer in England and the Englishspeaking peoples
Grasp firmly that England was all Bladesover two hundred years ago that it has had Reform Acts indeed and suchlike changes of formula but no essential revolution since then that all that is modern and different has come in as a thing intruded or as a gloss upon this predominant formula either impertinently or apologetically and you will perceive at once the reasonableness the necessity of that snobbishness which is the distinctive quality of English thought
Everybody who is not actually in the shadow of a Bladesover is as it were perpetually seeking after lost orientations
We have never broken with our tradition never even symbolically hewed it to pieces as the French did in quivering fact in the Terror
But all the organizing ideas have slackened the old habitual bonds have relaxed or altogether come undone
And America too is as it were a detached outlying part of that estate which has expanded in queer ways
George Washington Esquire was of the gentlefolk and he came near being a King
It was Plutarch you know and nothing intrinsically American that prevented George Washington being a King IV I hated teatime in the housekeepers room more than anything else at Bladesover
And more particularly I hated it when Mrs Mackridge and Mrs Booch and Mrs LatudeFernay were staying in the house
They were all three of them pensionedoff servants
Old friends of Lady Drews had rewarded them posthumously for a prolonged devotion to their minor comforts and Mrs Booch was also trustee for a favourite Skye terrier
Every year Lady Drew gave them an invitationa reward and encouragement of virtue with especial reference to my mother and Miss Fison the maid
They sat about in black and shiny and flouncey clothing adorned with gimp and beads eating great quantities of cake drinking much tea in a stately manner and reverberating remarks
I remember these women as immense
No doubt they were of negotiable size but I was only a very little chap and they have assumed nightmare proportions in my mind
They loomed they bulged they impended
Mrs Mackridge was large and dark there was a marvel about her head inasmuch as she was bald
She wore a dignified cap and in front of that upon her brow hair was PAINTED
I have never seen the like since
She had been maid to the widow of Sir Roderick Blenderhasset Impey some sort of governor or suchlike portent in the East Indies and from her remainsin Mrs MackridgeI judge Lady Impey was a very stupendous and crushing creature indeed
Lady Impey had been of the Juno type haughty unapproachable given to irony and a caustic wit
Mrs Mackridge had no wit but she had acquired the caustic voice and gestures along with the old satins and trimmings of the great lady
When she told you it was a fine morning she seemed also to be telling you you were a fool and a low fool to boot when she was spoken to she had a way of acknowledging your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous scornful Haw
that made you want to burn her alive
She also had a way of saying Indade
with a droop of the eyelids
Mrs Booch was a smaller woman brown haired with queer little curls on either side of her face large blue eyes and a small set of stereotyped remarks that constituted her entire mental range
Mrs LatudeFernay has left oddly enough no memory at all except her name and the effect of a greengrey silk dress all set with gold and blue buttons
I fancy she was a large blonde
Then there was Miss Fison the maid who served both Lady Drew and Miss Somerville and at the end of the table opposite my mother sat Rabbits the butler
Rabbits for a butler was an unassuming man and at tea he was not as you know butlers but in a morning coat and a black tie with blue spots
Still he was large with side whiskers even if his cleanshaven mouth was weak and little
I sat among these people on a high hard early Gregorian chair trying to exist like a feeble seedling amidst great rocks and my mother sat with an eye upon me resolute to suppress the slightest manifestation of vitality
It was hard on me but perhaps it was also hard upon these rather overfed ageing pretending people that my youthful restlessness and rebellious unbelieving eyes should be thrust in among their dignities
Tea lasted for nearly threequarters of an hour and I sat it out perforce and day after day the talk was exactly the same
Sugar Mrs
Mackridge
my mother used to ask
Sugar Mrs
LatudeFernay
The word sugar would stir the mind of Mrs Mackridge
They say she would begin issuing her proclamationat least half her sentences began they saysugar is fattaning nowadays
Many of the best people do not take it at all
Not with their tea maam said Rabbits intelligently
Not with anything said Mrs Mackridge with an air of crushing repartee and drank
What wont they say next
said Miss Fison
They do say such things
said Mrs Booch
They say said Mrs Mackridge inflexibly the doctors are not recommanding it now
My Mother No maam
Mrs Mackridge No maam
Then to the table at large Poor Sir Roderick before he died consumed great quantaties of sugar
I have sometimes fancied it may have hastened his end
This ended the first skirmish
A certain gloom of manner and a pause was considered due to the sacred memory of Sir Roderick
George said my mother dont kick the chair
Then perhaps Mrs Booch would produce a favourite piece from her repertoire
The evenings are drawing out nicely she would say or if the season was decadent How the evenings draw in
It was an invaluable remark to her I do not know how she would have got along without it
My mother who sat with her back to the window would always consider it due to Mrs Booch to turn about and regard the evening in the act of elongation or contraction whichever phase it might be
A brisk discussion of how long we were to the longest or shortest day would ensue and die away at last exhausted
Mrs Mackridge perhaps would reopen
She had many intelligent habits among others she read the paperThe Morning Post
The other ladies would at times tackle that sheet but only to read the births marriages and deaths on the front page
It was of course the old Morning Post that cost threepence not the brisk coruscating young thing of today
They say she would open that Lord Tweedums is to go to Canada
Ah
said Mr Rabbits dew they
Isnt he said my mother the Earl of Slumgolds cousin
She knew he was it was an entirely irrelevant and unnecessary remark but still something to say
The same maam said Mrs Mackridge
They say he was extremelay popular in New South Wales
They looked up to him greatlay
I knew him maam as a young man
A very nice pleasant young fella
Interlude of respect
Is predecessor said Rabbits who had acquired from some clerical model a precise emphatic articulation without acquiring at the same time the aspirates that would have graced it got into trouble at Sydney
Haw
said Mrs Mackridge scornfully so am tawled
E came to Templemorton after e came back and I remember them talking im over after ed gone again
Haw
said Mrs Mackridge interrogatively
Is fuss was quotin poetry maam
E saidwhat was it e saidThey lef their country for their countrys goodwhich in some way was took to remind them of their being originally convics though now reformed
Every one I eard speak agreed it was takless of im
Sir Roderick used to say said Mrs Mackridge that the First Thinghere Mrs Mackridge paused and looked dreadfully at meand the Second Thinghere she fixed me againand the Third Thingnow I was releasedneeded in a colonial governor is Tact
She became aware of my doubts again and added predominantly It has always struck me that that was a Singularly True Remark
I resolved that if ever I found this polypus of Tact growing up in my soul I would tear it out by the roots throw it forth and stamp on it
Theyre queer peoplecolonials said Rabbits very queer
When I was at Templemorton I see something of em
Queer fellows some of em
Very respectful of course free with their money in a spasammy sort of way but Some of em I must confess make me nervous
They have an eye on you
They watch youas you wait
They let themselves appear to be lookin at you My mother said nothing in that discussion
The word colonies always upset her
She was afraid I think that if she turned her mind in that direction my errant father might suddenly and shockingly be discovered no doubt conspicuously bigamic and altogether offensive and revolutionary
She did not want to rediscover my father at all
It is curious that when I was a little listening boy I had such an idea of our colonies that I jeered in my heart at Mrs Mackridges colonial ascendancy
These brave emancipated sunburnt English of the open I thought suffer these aristocratic invaders as a quaint anachronism but as for being gratified
I dont jeer now
Im not so sure
V It is a little difficult to explain why I did not come to do what was the natural thing for any one in my circumstances to do and take my world for granted
A certain innate scepticism I think explains it and a certain inaptitude for sympathetic assimilation
My father I believe was a sceptic my mother was certainly a hard woman
I was an only child and to this day I do not know whether my father is living or dead
He fled my mothers virtues before my distincter memories began
He left no traces in his flight and she in her indignation destroyed every vestige that she could of him
Never a photograph nor a scrap of his handwriting have I seen and it was I know only the accepted code of virtue and discretion that prevented her destroying her marriage certificate and me and so making a clean sweep of her matrimonial humiliation
I suppose I must inherit something of the moral stupidity that would enable her to make a holocaust of every little personal thing she had of him
There must have been presents made by him as a lover for examplebooks with kindly inscriptions letters perhaps a flattened flower a ring or suchlike gage
She kept her weddingring of course but all the others she destroyed
She never told me his christian name or indeed spoke a word to me of him though at times I came near daring to ask her add what I have of himit isnt muchI got from his brother my hero my uncle Ponderevo
She wore her ring her marriage certificate she kept in a sealed envelope in the very bottom of her largest trunk and me she sustained at a private school among the Kentish hills
You must not think I was always at Bladesovereven in my holidays
If at the time these came round Lady Drew was vexed by recent Company or for any other reason wished to take it out of my mother then she used to ignore the customary reminder my mother gave her and I stayed on at the school
But such occasions were rare and I suppose that between ten and fourteen I averaged fifty days a year at Bladesover
Dont imagine I deny that was a fine thing for me
Bladesover in absorbing the whole countryside had not altogether missed greatness
The Bladesover system has at least done one good thing for England it has abolished the peasant habit of mind
If many of us still live and breathe pantry and housekeepers room we are quit of the dream of living by economising parasitically on hens and pigs About that park there were some elements of a liberal education there was a great space of greensward not given over to manure and food grubbing there was mystery there was matter for the imagination
It was still a park of deer
I saw something of the life of these dappled creatures heard the belling of stags came upon young fawns among the bracken found bones skulls and antlers in lonely places
There were corners that gave a gleam of meaning to the word forest glimpses of unstudied natural splendour
There was a slope of bluebells in the broken sunlight under the newly green beeches in the west wood that is now precious sapphire in my memory it was the first time that I knowingly met Beauty
And in the house there were books
The rubbish old Lady Drew read I never saw stuff of the Maria Monk type I have since gathered had a fascination for her but back in the past there had been a Drew of intellectual enterprise Sir Cuthbert the son of Sir Matthew who built the house and thrust away neglected and despised in an old room upstairs were books and treasures of his that my mother let me rout among during a spell of wintry wet
Sitting under a dormer window on a shelf above great stores of tea and spices I became familiar with much of Hogarth in a big portfolio with Raphael there was a great book of engravings from the stanzas of Raphael in the Vaticanand with most of the capitals of Europe as they had looked about 1780 by means of several pig ironmoulded books of views
There was also a broad eighteenth century atlas with huge wandering maps that instructed me mightily
It had splendid adornments about each map title Holland showed a fisherman and his boat Russia a Cossack Japan remarkable people attired in pagodasI say it deliberately pagodas
There were Terrae Incognitae in every continent then Poland Sarmatia lands since lost and many a voyage I made with a blunted pin about that large incorrect and dignified world
The books in that little old closet had been banished I suppose from the saloon during the Victorian revival of good taste and emasculated orthodoxy but my mother had no suspicion of their character
So I read and understood the good sound rhetoric of Tom Paines Rights of Man and his Common Sense excellent books once praised by bishops and since sedulously lied about
Gulliver was there unexpurgated strong meat for a boy perhaps but not too strong I holdI have never regretted that I escaped niceness in these affairs
The satire of Traldragdubh made my blood boil as it was meant to do but I hated Swift for the Houyhnhnms and never quite liked a horse afterwards
Then I remember also a translation of Voltaires Candide and Rasselas and vast book though it was I really believe I read in a muzzy sort of way of course from end to end and even with some reference now and then to the Atlas Gibbonin twelve volumes
These readings whetted my taste for more and surreptitiously I raided the bookcases in the big saloon
I got through quite a number of books before my sacrilegious temerity was discovered by Ann the old headhousemaid
I remember that among others I tried a translation of Platos Republic then and found extraordinarily little interest in it I was much too young for that but VathekVathek was glorious stuff
That kicking affair
When everybody HAD to kick
The thought of Vathek always brings back with it my boyish memory of the big saloon at Bladesover
It was a huge long room with many windows opening upon the park and each windowthere were a dozen or more reaching from the floor uphad its elaborate silk or satin curtains heavily fringed a canopy is it
above its completely white shutters folding into the deep thickness of the wall
At either end of that great still place was an immense marble chimneypiece the end by the bookcase showed the wolf and Romulus and Remus with Homer and Virgil for supporters the design of the other end I have forgotten
Frederick Prince of Wales swaggered flatly over the one twice lifesize but mellowed by the surface gleam of oil and over the other was an equally colossal group of departed Drews as sylvan deities scantily clad against a stormrent sky
Down the centre of the elaborate ceiling were three chandeliers each bearing some hundreds of dangling glass lustres and over the interminable carpetit impressed me as about as big as Sarmatia in the storeroom Atlaswere islands and archipelagoes of chintzcovered chairs and couches tables great Sevres vases on pedestals a bronze man and horse
Somewhere in this wilderness one came I remember upona big harp beside a lyreshaped music stand and a grand piano
The bookborrowing raid was one of extraordinary dash and danger
One came down the main service stairsthat was legal and illegality began in a little landing when very cautiously one went through a red baize door
A little passage led to the hall and here one reconnoitered for Ann the old headhousemaidthe younger housemaids were friendly and did not count
Ann located came a dash across the open space at the foot of that great staircase that has never been properly descended since powder went out of fashion and so to the saloon door
A beast of an oscillating Chinaman in china as large as life grimaced and quivered to ones lightest steps
That door was the perilous place it was double with the thickness of the wall between so that one could not listen beforehand for the whisk of the featherbrush on the other side
Oddly ratlike is it not this darting into enormous places in pursuit of the abandoned crumbs of thought
And I found Langhornes Plutarch too I remember on those shelves
It seems queer to me now to think that I acquired pride and selfrespect the idea of a state and the germ of public spirit in such a furtive fashion queer too that it should rest with an old Greek dead these eighteen hundred years to teach that
VI The school I went to was the sort of school the Bladesover system permitted
The public schools that add comic into existence in the brief glow of the Renascence had been taken possession of by the ruling class the lower classes were not supposed to stand in need of schools and our middle stratum got the schools it deserved private schools schools any unqualified pretender was free to establish
Mine was kept by a man who had had the energy to get himself a College of Preceptors diploma and considering how cheap his charges were I will readily admit the place might have been worse
The building was a dingy yellowbrick residence outside the village with the schoolroom as an outbuilding of lath and plaster
I do not remember that my schooldays were unhappyindeed I recall a good lot of fine mixed fun in thembut I cannot without grave risk of misinterpretation declare that we were at all nice and refined
We fought much not sound formal fighting but scrapping of a sincere and murderous kind into which one might bring ones bootsit made us tough at any rateand several of us were the sons of London publicans who distinguished scraps where one meant to hurt from ordered pugilism practising both arts and having moreover precocious linguistic gifts
Our cricketfield was bald about the wickets and we played without style and disputed with the umpire and the teaching was chiefly in the hands of a lout of nineteen who wore readymade clothes and taught despicably
The headmaster and proprietor taught us arithmetic algebra and Euclid and to the older boys even trigonometry himself he had a strong mathematical bias and I think now that by the standard of a British public school he did rather well by us
We had one inestimable privilege at that school and that was spiritual neglect
We dealt with one another with the forcible simplicity of natural boys we cheeked and punched and clouted we thought ourselves Red Indians and cowboys and suchlike honourable things and not young English gentlemen we never felt the strain of Onward Christian soldiers nor were swayed by any premature piety in the cold oak pew of our Sunday devotions
All that was good
We spent our rare pennies in the uncensored reading matter of the village dames shop on the Boys of England and honest penny dreadfulsripping stuff stuff that anticipated Haggard and Stevenson badly printed and queerly illustrated and very very good for us
On our halfholidays we were allowed the unusual freedom of rambling in twos and threes wide and far about the land talking experimentally dreaming wildly
There was much in those walks
To this day the landscape of the Kentish world with its low broad distances its hop gardens and golden stretches of wheat its oasts and square church towers its background of downland and hangers has for me a faint sense of adventure added to the pleasure of its beauty
We smoked on occasion but nobody put us up to the proper boyish things to do we never robbed an orchard for example though there were orchards all about us we thought stealing was sinful we stole incidental apples and turnips and strawberries from the fields indeed but in a criminal inglorious fashion and afterwards we were ashamed
We had our days of adventure but they were natural accidents our own adventures
There was one hot day when several of us walking out towards Maidstone were incited by the devil to despise ginger beer and we fuddled ourselves dreadfully with ale and a time when our young minds were infected to the pitch of buying pistols by the legend of the Wild West
Young Roots from Highbury came back with a revolver and cartridges and we went off six strong to live a free wild life one holiday afternoon
We fired our first shot deep in the old flint mine at Chiselstead and nearly burst our ear drums then we fired in a primrose studded wood by Pickthorn Green and I gave a false alarm of keeper and we fled in disorder for a mile
After which Roots suddenly shot at a pheasant in the high road by Chiselstead and then young Barker told lies about the severity of the game laws and made Roots sore afraid and we hid the pistol in a dry ditch outside the school field
A day or so after we got in again and ignoring a certain fouling and rusting of the barrel tried for a rabbit at three hundred yards
Young Roots blew a molehill at twenty paces into a dust cloud burnt his fingers and scorched his face and the weapon having once displayed this strange disposition to flame back upon the shooter was not subsequently fired
One main source of excitement for us was cheeking people in vans and carts upon the Goudhurst road and getting myself into a monstrous white mess in the chalk pits beyond the village and catching yellow jaundice as a sequel to bathing stark naked with three other Adamites old Ewart leading that function in the rivulet across Hicksons meadows are among my memorabilia
Those free imaginative afternoons
how much they were for us
how much they did for us
All streams came from the then undiscovered sources of the Nile in those days all thickets were Indian jungles and our best game I say it with pride I invented
I got it out of the Bladesover saloon
We found a wood where Trespassing was forbidden and did the Retreat of the Ten Thousand through it from end to end cutting our way bravely through a host of nettle beds that barred our path and not forgetting to weep and kneel when at last we emerged within sight of the High Road Sea
So we have burst at times weeping and rejoicing upon startled wayfarers
Usually I took the part of that distinguished general Xenophenand please note the quantity of the o I have all my classical names like thatSocrates rhymes with Bates for me and except when the bleak eye of some scholar warns me of his standards of judgment I use those dear old mispronunciations still
The little splash into Latin made during my days as a chemist washed off nothing of the habit
Wellif I met those great gentlemen of the past with their accents carelessly adjusted I did at least meet them alive as an equal and in a living tongue
Altogether my school might easily have been worse for me and among other good things it gave me a friend who has lasted my life out
This was Ewart who is now a monumental artist at Woking after many vicissitudes
Dear chap how he did stick out of his clothes to be sure
He was a longlimbed lout ridiculously tall beside my more youth full compactness and except that there was no black moustache under his nose blob he had the same round knobby face as he has today the same bright and active hazel brown eyes the stare the meditative moment the insinuating reply
Surely no boy ever played the fool as Bob Ewart used to play it no boy had a readier knack of mantling the world with wonder
Commonness vanished before Ewart at his expository touch all things became memorable and rare
From him I first heard tell of love but only after its barbs were already sticking in my heart
He was I know now the bastard of that great improvident artist Rickmann Ewart he brought the light of a lax world that at least had not turned its back upon beauty into the growing fermentation of my mind
I won his heart by a version of Vathek and after that we were inseparable yarning friends
We merged our intellectual stock so completely that I wonder sometimes how much I did not become Ewart how much Ewart is not vicariously and derivatively me
VII And then when I had newly passed my fourteenth birthday came my tragic disgrace
It was in my midsummer holidays that the thing happened and it was through the Honourable Beatrice Normandy
She had come into my life as they say before I was twelve
She descended unexpectedly into a peaceful interlude that followed the annual going of those Three Great Women
She came into the old nursery upstairs and every day she had tea with us in the housekeepers room
She was eight and she came with a nurse called Nannie and to begin with I did not like her at all
Nobody liked this irruption into the downstairs rooms the two gave troublea dire offence Nannies sense of duty to her charge led to requests and demands that took my mothers breath away
Eggs at unusual times the reboiling of milk the rejection of an excellent milk puddingnot negotiated respectfully but dictated as of right
Nannie was a dark longfeatured taciturn woman in a grey dress she had a furtive inflexibility of manner that finally dismayed and crushed and overcame
She conveyed she was under orderslike a Greek tragedy
She was that strange product of the old time a devoted trusted servant she had as it were banked all her pride and will with the greater more powerful people who employed her in return for a lifelong security of servitudethe bargain was nonetheless binding for being implicit
Finally they were to pension her and she would die the hated treasure of a boardinghouse
She had built up in herself an enormous habit of reference to these upstairs people she had curbed down all discordant murmurings of her soul her very instincts were perverted or surrendered
She was sexless her personal pride was all transferred she mothered another womans child with a hard joyless devotion that was at least entirely compatible with a stoical separation
She treated us all as things that counted for nothing save to fetch and carry for her charge
But the Honourable Beatrice could condescend
The queer chances of later years come between me and a distinctly separated memory of that childish face
When I think of Beatrice I think of her as I came to know her at a later time when at last I came to know her so well that indeed now I could draw her and show a hundred little delicate things you would miss in looking at her
But even then I remember how I noted the infinite delicacy of her childish skin and the fine eyebrow finer than the finest feather that ever one felt on the breast of a bird
She was one of those elfin rather precocious little girls quick coloured with dark hair naturally curling dusky hair that was sometimes astray over her eyes and eyes that were sometimes impishly dark and sometimes a clear brown yellow
And from the very outset after a most cursory attention to Rabbits she decided that the only really interesting thing at the teatable was myself
The elders talked in their formal dull waytelling Nannie the trite old things about the park and the village that they told every one and Beatrice watched me across the table with a pitiless little curiosity that made me uncomfortable
Nannie she said pointing and Nannie left a question of my mothers disregarded to attend to her is he a servant boy 
Sssh said Nannie
Hes Master Ponderevo
Is he a servant boy
repeated Beatrice
Hes a schoolboy said my mother
Then may I talk to him Nannie
Nannie surveyed me with brutal inhumanity
You mustnt talk too much she said to her charge and cut cake into fingers for her
No she added decisively as Beatrice made to speak
Beatrice became malignant
Her eyes explored me with unjustifiable hostility
Hes got dirty hands she said stabbing at the forbidden fruit
And theres a fray to his collar
Then she gave herself up to cake with an appearance of entire forgetfulness of me that filled me with hate and a passionate desire to compel her to admire me And the next day before tea I did for the first time in my life freely without command or any compulsion wash my hands
So our acquaintance began and presently was deepened by a whim of hers
She had a cold and was kept indoors and confronted Nannie suddenly with the alternative of being hopelessly naughty which in her case involved a generous amount of screaming unsuitable for the ears of an elderly shaky rich aunt or having me up to the nursery to play with her all the afternoon
Nannie came downstairs and borrowed me in a careworn manner and I was handed over to the little creature as if I was some large variety of kitten
I had never had anything to do with a little girl before I thought she was more beautiful and wonderful and bright than anything else could possibly be in life and she found me the gentlest of slavesthough at the same time as I made evident fairly strong
And Nannie was amazed to find the afternoon slip cheerfully and rapidly away
She praised my manners to Lady Drew and to my mother who said she was glad to hear well of me and after that I played with Beatrice several times
The toys she had remain in my memory still as great splendid things gigantic to all my previous experience of toys and we even went to the great dolls house on the nursery landing to play discreetly with that the great dolls house that the Prince Regent had given Sir Harry Drews firstborn who died at five that was a not ineffectual model of Bladesover itself and contained eightyfive dolls and had cost hundreds of pounds
I played under imperious direction with that toy of glory
I went back to school when that holiday was over dreaming of beautiful things and got Ewart to talk to me of love and I made a great story out of the dolls house a story that taken over into Ewarts hands speedily grew to an island dolls city all our own
One of the dolls I privately decided was like Beatrice
One other holiday there was when I saw something of heroddly enough my memory of that second holiday in which she played a part is vagueand then came a gap of a year and then my disgrace
VIII Now I sit down to write my story and tell over again things in their order I find for the first time how inconsecutive and irrational a thing the memory can be
One recalls acts and cannot recall motives one recalls quite vividly moments that stand out inexplicably things adrift joining on to nothing leading nowhere
I think I must have seen Beatrice and her halfbrother quite a number of times in my last holiday at Bladesover but I really cannot recall more than a little of the quality of the circumstances
That great crisis of my boyhood stands out very vividly as an effect as a sort of cardinal thing for me but when I look for details particularly details that led up to the crisisI cannot find them in any developing order at all
This halfbrother Archie Garvell was a new factor in the affair
I remember him clearly as a fairhaired supercilious looking weedilylank boy much taller than I but I should imagine very little heavier and that we hated each other by a sort of instinct from the beginning and yet I cannot remember my first meeting with him at all
Looking back into these past thingsit is like rummaging in a neglected attic that has experienced the attentions of some whimsical robberI cannot even account for the presence of these children at Bladesover
They were I know among the innumerable cousins of Lady Drew and according to the theories of downstairs candidates for the ultimate possession of Bladesover
If they were their candidature was unsuccessful
But that great place with all its faded splendour its fine furniture its large traditions was entirely at the old ladys disposition and I am inclined to think it is true that she used this fact to torment and dominate a number of eligible people
Lord Osprey was among the number of these and she showed these hospitalities to his motherless child and stepchild partly no doubt because he was poor but quite as much I nowadays imagine in the dim hope of finding some affectionate or imaginative outcome of contact with them
Nannie had dropped out of the world this second time and Beatrice was in the charge of an extremely amiable and ineffectual poor armyclass young woman whose name I never knew
They were I think two remarkably illmanaged and enterprising children
I seem to remember too that it was understood that I was not a fit companion for them and that our meetings had to be as unostentatious as possible
It was Beatrice who insisted upon our meeting
I am certain I knew quite a lot about love at fourteen and that I was quite as much in love with Beatrice then as any impassioned adult could be and that Beatrice was in her way in love with me
It is part of the decent and useful pretences of our world that children of the age at which we were think nothing feel nothing know nothing of love
It is wonderful what people the English are for keeping up pretences
But indeed I cannot avoid telling that Beatrice and I talked of love and kissed and embraced one another
I recall something of one talk under the overhanging bushes of the shrubberyI on the park side of the stone wall and the lady of my worship a little inelegantly astride thereon
Inelegantly do I say
you should have seen the sweet imp as I remember her
Just her poise on the wall comes suddenly clear before me and behind her the light various branches of the bushes of the shrubbery that my feet might not profane and far away and high behind her dim and stately the cornice of the great facade of Bladesover rose against the dappled sky
Our talk must have been serious and businesslike for we were discussing my social position
I dont love Archie she had said apropos of nothing and then in a whisper leaning forward with the hair about her face I love YOU
But she had been a little pressing to have it clear that I was not and could not be a servant
Youll never be a servantever
I swore that very readily and it is a vow I have kept by nature
What will you be
said she
I ran my mind hastily over the professions
Will you be a soldier
she asked
And be bawled at by duffers
No fear
said I
Leave that to the ploughboys
But an officer 
I dont know I said evading a shameful difficulty
Id rather go into the navy
Wouldnt you like to fight
Id like to fight I said
But a common soldier its no honour to have to be told to fight and to be looked down upon while you do it and how could I be an officer
Couldnt you be
she said and looked at me doubtfully and the spaces of the social system opened between us
Then as became a male of spirit I took upon myself to brag and lie my way through this trouble
I said I was a poor man and poor men went into the navy that I knew mathematics which no army officer did and I claimed Nelson for an exemplar and spoke very highly of my outlook upon blue water
He loved Lady Hamilton I said although she was a ladyand I will love you
We were somewhere near that when the egregious governess became audible calling Beeeeatrice
Beeeeeatrice
Snifty beast
said my lady and tried to get on with the conversation but that governess made things impossible
Come here
said my lady suddenly holding out a grubby hand and I went very close to her and she put her little head down upon the wall until her black fog of hair tickled my cheek
You are my humble faithful lover she demanded in a whisper her warm flushed face near touching mine and her eyes very dark and lustrous
I am your humble faithful lover I whispered back
And she put her arm about my head and put out her lips and we kissed and boy though I was I was all atremble
So we two kissed for the first time
Beeeeeeatrice
fearfully close
My lady had vanished with one wild kick of her blackstocking leg
A moment after I heard her sustaining the reproaches of her governess and explaining her failure to answer with an admirable lucidity and disingenuousness
I felt it was unnecessary for me to be seen just then and I vanished guiltily round the corner into the West Wood and so to lovedreams and singlehanded play wandering along one of those meandering bracken valleys that varied Bladesover park
And that day and for many days that kiss upon my lips was a seal and by night the seed of dreams
Then I remember an expedition we madeshe I and her halfbrotherinto those West Woodsthey two were supposed to be playing in the shrubberyand how we were Indians there and made a wigwam out of a pile of beech logs and how we stalked deer crept near and watched rabbits feeding in a glade and almost got a squirrel
It was play seasoned with plentiful disputing between me and young Garvell for each firmly insisted upon the leading roles and only my wider readingI had read ten stories to his onegave me the ascendency over him
Also I scored over him by knowing how to find the eagle in a bracken stem
And somehowI dont remember what led to it at allI and Beatrice two hot and ruffled creatures crept in among the tall bracken and hid from him
The great fronds rose above us five feet or more and as I had learnt how to wriggle through that undergrowth with the minimum of betrayal by tossing greenery above I led the way
The ground under bracken is beautifully clear and faintly scented in warm weather the stems come up black and then green if you crawl flat it is a tropical forest in miniature
I led the way and Beatrice crawled behind and then as the green of the further glade opened before us stopped
She crawled up to me her hot little face came close to mine once more she looked and breathed close to me and suddenly she flung her arm about my neck and dragged me to earth beside her and kissed me and kissed me again
We kissed we embraced and kissed again all without a word we desisted we stared and hesitatedthen in a suddenly damped mood and a little perplexed at ourselves crawled out to be presently run down and caught in the tamest way by Archie
That comes back very clearly to me and other vague memoriesI know old Hall and his gun out shooting at jackdaws came into our common experiences but I dont remember how and then at last abruptly our fight in the Warren stands out
The Warren like most places in England that have that name was not particularly a warren it was a long slope of thorns and beeches through which a path ran and made an alternative route to the downhill carriage road between Bladesover and Ropedean
I dont know how we three got there but I have an uncertain fancy it was connected with a visit paid by the governess to the Ropedean vicarage people
But suddenly Archie and I in discussing a game fell into a dispute for Beatrice
I had made him the fairest offer I was to be a Spanish nobleman she was to be my wife and he was to be a tribe of Indians trying to carry her off
It seems to me a fairly attractive offer to a boy to be a whole tribe of Indians with a chance of such a booty
But Archie suddenly took offence
No he said we cant have that
Cant have what
You cant be a gentleman because you arent
And you cant play Beatrice is your wife
Itsits impertinent
But I said and looked at her
Some earlier grudge in the days affairs must have been in Archies mind
We let you play with us said Archie but we cant have things like that
What rot
said Beatrice
He can if he likes
But he carried his point
I let him carry it and only began to grow angry three or four minutes later
Then we were still discussing play and disputing about another game
Nothing seemed right for all of us
We dont want you to play with us at all said Archie
Yes we do said Beatrice
He drops his aitches like anything
No e doesnt said I in the heat of the moment
There you go
he cried
E he says
E
E
E
He pointed a finger at me
He had struck to the heart of my shame
I made the only possible reply by a rush at him
Hello
he cried at my blackavised attack
He dropped back into an attitude that had some style in it parried my blow got back at my cheek and laughed with surprise and relief at his own success
Whereupon I became a thing of murderous rage
He could box as well or better than Ihe had yet to realise I knew anything of that at allbut I had fought once or twice to a finish with bare fists
I was used to inflicting and enduring savage hurting and I doubt if he had ever fought
I hadnt fought ten seconds before I felt this softness in him realised all that quality of modern upperclass England that never goes to the quick that hedges about rules and those petty points of honour that are the ultimate comminution of honour that claims credit for things demonstrably half done
He seemed to think that first hit of his and one or two others were going to matter that I ought to give in when presently my lip bled and dripped blood upon my clothes
So before we had been at it a minute he had ceased to be aggressive except in momentary spurts and I was knocking him about almost as I wanted to do and demanding breathlessly and fiercely after our school manner whether he had had enough not knowing that by his high code and his soft training it was equally impossible for him to either buckup and beat me or give in
I have a very distinct impression of Beatrice dancing about us during the affair in a state of unladylike appreciation but I was too preoccupied to hear much of what she was saying
But she certainly backed us both and I am inclined to think nowit may be the disillusionment of my ripened yearswhichever she thought was winning
Then young Garvell giving way before my slogging stumbled and fell over a big flint and I still following the tradition of my class and school promptly flung myself on him to finish him
We were busy with each other on the ground when we became aware of a dreadful interruption
Shut up you FOOL
said Archie
Oh Lady Drew
I heard Beatrice cry
Theyre fighting
Theyre fighting something awful
I looked over my shoulder
Archies wish to get up became irresistible and my resolve to go on with him vanished altogether
I became aware of the two old ladies presences of black and purple silk and fur and shining dark things they had walked up through the Warren while the horses took the hill easily and so had come upon us
Beatrice had gone to them at once with an air of taking refuge and stood beside and a little behind them
We both rose dejectedly
The two old ladies were evidently quite dreadfully shocked and peering at us with their poor old eyes and never had I seen such a tremblement in Lady Drews lorgnettes
Youve never been fighting 
said Lady Drew
You have been fighting
It wasnt proper fighting snapped Archie with accusing eyes on me
Its Mrs Ponderevos George
said Miss Somerville so adding a conviction for ingratitude to my evident sacrilege
How could he DARE
cried Lady Drew becoming very awful
He broke the rules said Archie sobbing for breath
I slipped andhe hit me while I was down
He knelt on me
How could you DARE
said Lady Drew
I produced an experienced handkerchief rolled up into a tight ball and wiped the blood from my chin but I offered no explanation of my daring
Among other things that prevented that I was too short of breath
He didnt fight fair sobbed Archie
Beatrice from behind the old ladies regarded me intently and without hostility
I am inclined to think the modification of my face through the damage to my lip interested her
It became dimly apparent to my confused intelligence that I must not say these two had been playing with me
That would not be after the rules of their game
I resolved in this difficult situation upon a sulky silence and to take whatever consequences might follow
IX The powers of justice in Bladesover made an extraordinary mess of my case
I have regretfully to admit that the Honourable Beatrice Normandy did at the age of ten betray me abandon me and lie most abominably about me
She was as a matter of fact panicstricken about me conscience stricken too she bolted from the very thought of my being her affianced lover and so forth from the faintest memory of kissing she was indeed altogether disgraceful and human in her betrayal
She and her halfbrother lied in perfect concord and I was presented as a wanton assailant of my social betters
They were waiting about in the Warren when I came up and spoke to them etc
On the whole I now perceive Lady Drews decisions were in the light of the evidence reasonable and merciful
They were conveyed to me by my mother who was I really believe even more shocked by the grossness of my social insubordination than Lady Drew
She dilated on her ladyships kindnesses to me on the effrontery and wickedness of my procedure and so came at last to the terms of my penance
You must go up to young Mr Garvell and beg his pardon
I wont beg his pardon I said speaking for the first time
My mother paused incredulous
I folded my arms on her tablecloth and delivered my wicked little ultimatum
I wont beg his pardon nohow I said
See
Then you will have to go off to your uncle Frapp at Chatham
I dont care where I have to go or what I have to do I wont beg his pardon I said
And I didnt
After that I was one against the world
Perhaps in my mothers heart there lurked some pity for me but she did not show it
She took the side of the young gentleman she tried hard she tried very hard to make me say I was sorry I had struck him
Sorry
I couldnt explain
So I went into exile in the dogcart to Redwood station with Jukes the coachman coldly silent driving me and all my personal belongings in a small American cloth portmanteau behind
I felt I had much to embitter me the game had and the beginnings of fairness by any standards I knew
But the thing that embittered me most was that the Honourable Beatrice Normandy should have repudiated and fled from me as though I was some sort of leper and not even have taken a chance or so to give me a goodbye
She might have done that anyhow
Supposing I had told on her
But the son of a servant counts as a servant
She had forgotten and now remembered
I solaced myself with some extraordinary dream of coming back to Bladesover stern powerful after the fashion of Coriolanus
I do not recall the details but I have no doubt I displayed great magnanimity Well anyhow I never said I was sorry for pounding young Garvell and I am not sorry to this day
CHAPTER THE SECOND OF MY LAUNCH INTO THE WORLD AND THE LAST I SAW OF BLADESOVER I When I was thus banished from Bladesover House as it was then thought for good and all I was sent by my mother in a vindictive spirit first to her cousin Nicodemus Frapp and then as a fully indentured apprentice to my uncle Ponderevo
I ran away from the care of my cousin Nicodemus back to Bladesover House
My cousin Nicodemus Frapp was a baker in a back streeta slum ratherjust off that miserable narrow mean high road that threads those exquisite beads Rochester and Chatham
He was I must admit a shock to me much dominated by a young plump prolific malingering wife a bent slowmoving unwilling dark man with flour in his hair and eyelashes in the lines of his face and the seams of his coat
Ive never had a chance to correct my early impression of him and he still remains an almost dreadful memory a sort of caricature of incompetent simplicity
As I remember him indeed he presented the servile tradition perfected
He had no pride in his person fine clothes and dressing up wasnt for the likes of him so that he got his wife who was no artist at it to cut his black hair at irregular intervals and let his nails become disagreeable to the fastidious eye he had no pride in his business nor any initiative his only virtues were not doing certain things and hard work
Your uncle said my motherall grownup cousins were uncles by courtesy among the Victorian middleclass isnt much to look at or talk to but hes a Good HardWorking Man
There was a sort of base honourableness about toil however needless in that system of inversion
Another point of honour was to rise at or before dawn and then laboriously muddle about
It was very distinctly impressed on my mind that the Good HardWorking Man would have thought it fallallish to own a pocket handkerchief
Poor old Frappdirty and crushed by product of Bladesovers magnificence
He made no fight against the world at all he was floundering in small debts that were not so small but that finally they overwhelmed him whenever there was occasion for any exertion his wife fell back upon pains and her condition and God sent them many children most of whom died and so by their coming and going gave a double exercise in the virtues of submission
Resignation to Gods will was the common device of these people in the face of every duty and every emergency
There were no books in the house I doubt if either of them had retained the capacity for reading consecutively for more than a minute or so and it was with amazement that day after day over and above stale bread one beheld food and again more food amidst the litter that held permanent session on the livingroom table
One might have doubted if either of them felt discomfort in this dusty darkness of existence if it was not that they did visibly seek consolation
They sought this and found it of a Sunday not in strong drink and raving but in imaginary draughts of blood
They met with twenty or thirty other darkened and unclean people all dressed in dingy colours that would not show the dirt in a little brickbuilt chapel equipped with a spavined roarer of a harmonium and there solaced their minds on the thought that all that was fair and free in life all that struggled all that planned and made all pride and beauty and honour all fine and enjoyable things were irrevocably damned to everlasting torments
They were the selfappointed confidants of Gods mockery of his own creation
So at any rate they stick in my mind
Vaguer and yet hardly less agreeable than this cosmic jest this coming Yah clever
and general serving out and showing up of the lucky the bold and the cheerful was their own predestination to Glory
There is a Fountain filled with Blood Drawn from Emmanuels Veins so they sang
I hear the drone and wheeze of that hymn now
I hated them with the bitter uncharitable condemnation of boyhood and a twinge of that hate comes back to me
As I write the words the sounds and then the scene return these obscure undignified people a fat woman with asthma an old Welsh milkseller with a tumour on his bald head who was the intellectual leader of the sect a hugevoiced haberdasher with a big black beard a whitefaced extraordinarily pregnant woman his wife a spectacled rate collector with a bent back
I hear the talk about souls the strange battered old phrases that were coined ages ago in the seaports of the sundry Levant of balm of Gilead and manna in the desert of gourds that give shade and water in a thirsty land I recall again the way in which at the conclusion of the service the talk remained pious in form but became medical in substance and how the women got together for obstetric whisperings
I as a boy did not matter and might overhear
If Bladesover is my key for the explanation of England I think my invincible persuasion that I understand Russia was engendered by the circle of Uncle Frapp
I slept in a dingy sheeted bed with the two elder survivors of Frapp fecundity and spent my week days in helping in the laborious disorder of the shop and bakehouse in incidental deliveries of bread and so forth and in parrying the probings of my uncle into my relations with the Blood and his confidential explanations that ten shillings a weekwhich was what my mother paid himwas not enough to cover my accommodation
He was very anxious to keep that but also he wanted more
There were neither books nor any seat nor corner in that house where reading was possible no newspaper ever brought the clash of worldly things into its heavenward seclusion horror of it all grew in me daily and whenever I could I escaped into the streets and tramped about Chatham
The news shops appealed to me particularly
One saw there smudgy illustrated sheets the Police News in particular in which vilely drawn pictures brought home to the dullest intelligence an interminable succession of squalid crimes women murdered and put into boxes buried under floors old men bludgeoned at midnight by robbers people thrust suddenly out of trains happy lovers shot vitrioled and so forth by rivals
I got my first glimpse of the life of pleasure in foully drawn pictures of police raids on this and that
Interspersed with these sheets were others in which Sloper the urban John Bull had his fling with gin bottle and obese umbrella or the kindly empty faces of the Royal Family appeared and reappeared visiting this opening that getting married getting offspring lying in state doing everything but anything a wonderful goodmeaning impenetrable race apart
I have never revisited Chatham the impression it has left on my mind is one of squalid compression unlit by any gleam of a maturer charity
All its effects arranged themselves as antithetical to the Bladesover effects
They confirmed and intensified all that Bladesover suggested
Bladesover declared itself to be the land to be essentially England I have already told how its airy spaciousness its wide dignity seemed to thrust village church and vicarage into corners into a secondary and conditional significance
Here one gathered the corollary of that
Since the whole wide country of Kent was made up of contiguous Bladesovers and for the gentlefolk the surplus of population all who were not good tenants nor good labourers Church of England submissive and respectful were necessarily thrust together jostled out of sight to fester as they might in this place that had the colours and even the smells of a wellpacked dustbin
They should be grateful even for that that one felt was the theory of it all
And I loafed about this wilderness of crowded dinginess with young receptive wideopen eyes and through the blessing or curse of some fairy godmother of mine asking and asking again But after all WHY I wandered up through Rochester once and had a glimpse of the Stour valley above the town all horrible with cement works and foully smoking chimneys and rows of workmens cottages minute ugly uncomfortable and grimy
So I had my first intimation of how industrialism must live in a landlords land
I spent some hours too in the streets that give upon the river drawn by the spell of the sea
But I saw barges and ships stripped of magic and mostly devoted to cement ice timber and coal
The sailors looked to me gross and slovenly men and the shipping struck me as clumsy ugly old and dirty
I discovered that most sails dont fit the ships that hoist them and that there may be as pitiful and squalid a display of poverty with a vessel as with a man
When I saw colliers unloading watched the workers in the hold filling up silly little sacks and the succession of blackened halfnaked men that ran to and fro with these along a plank over a thirtyfoot drop into filth and mud I was first seized with admiration of their courage and toughness and then But after all WHY
and the stupid ugliness of all this waste of muscle and endurance came home to me
Among other things it obviously wasted and deteriorated the coal And I had imagined great things of the sea
Well anyhow for a time that vocation was stilled
But such impressions came into my leisure and of that I had no excess
Most of my time was spent doing things for Uncle Frapp and my evenings and nights perforce in the company of the two eldest of my cousins
He was errand boy at an oil shop and fervently pious and of him I saw nothing until the evening except at meals the other was enjoying the midsummer holidays without any great elation a singularly thin and abject stunted creature he was whose chief liveliness was to pretend to be a monkey and who I am now convinced had some secret disease that drained his vitality away
If I met him now I should think him a pitiful little creature and be extremely sorry for him
Then I felt only a wondering aversion
He sniffed horribly he was tired out by a couple of miles of loafing he never started any conversation and he seemed to prefer his own company to mine
His mother poor woman said he was the thoughtful one
Serious trouble came suddenly out of a conversation we held in bed one night
Some particularly pious phrase of my elder cousins irritated me extremely and I avowed outright my entire disbelief in the whole scheme of revealed religion
I had never said a word about my doubts to any one before except to Ewart who had first evolved them
I had never settled my doubts until at this moment when I spoke
But it came to me then that the whole scheme of salvation of the Frappes was not simply doubtful but impossible
I fired this discovery out into the darkness with the greatest promptitude
My abrupt denials certainly scared my cousin amazingly
At first they could not understand what I was saying and when they did I fully believe they expected an instant answer in thunderbolts and flames
They gave me more room in the bed forthwith and then the elder sat up and expressed his sense of my awfulness
I was already a little frightened at my temerity but when he asked me categorically to unsay what I had said what could I do but confirm my repudiation
Theres no hell I said and no eternal punishment
No God would be such a fool as that
My elder cousin cried aloud in horror and the younger lay scared but listening
Then you mean said my elder cousin when at last he could bring himself to argue you might do just as you liked
If you were cad enough said I
Our little voices went on interminably and at one stage my cousin got out of bed and made his brother do likewise and knelt in the night dimness and prayed at me
That I found trying but I held out valiantly
Forgive him said my cousin he knows not what he sayeth
You can pray if you like I said but if youre going to cheek me in your prayers I draw the line
The last I remember of that great discussion was my cousin deploring the fact that he should ever sleep in the same bed with an Infidel
The next day he astonished me by telling the whole business to his father
This was quite outside all my codes
Uncle Nicodemus sprang it upon me at the midday meal
You been sayin queer things George he said abruptly
You better mind what youre saying
What did he say father
said Mrs Frapp
Things I couldnt repeat said he
What things
I asked hotly
Ask IM said my uncle pointing with his knife to his informant and making me realise the nature of my offence
My aunt looked at the witness
Not
she framed a question
Wuss said my uncle
Blarsphemy
My aunt couldnt touch another mouthful
I was already a little troubled in my conscience by my daring and now I began to feel the black enormity of the course upon which I had embarked
I was only talking sense I said
I had a still more dreadful moment when presently I met my cousin in the brick alley behind the yard that led back to his grocers shop
You sneak
I said and smacked his face hard forthwith
Now then said I
He started back astonished and alarmed
His eyes met mine and I saw a sudden gleam of resolution
He turned his other cheek to me
It it he said
It it
ILL forgive you
I felt I had never encountered a more detestable way of evading a licking
I shoved him against the wall and left him there forgiving me and went back into the house
You better not speak to your cousins George said my aunt till youre in a better state of mind
I became an outcast forthwith
At supper that night a gloomy silence was broken by my cousin saying E it me for telling you and I turned the other cheek muvver
Es got the evil one beind im now a ridin on is back said my aunt to the grave discomfort of the eldest girl who sat beside me
After supper my uncle in a few illchosen words prayed me to repent before I slept
Suppose you was took in your sleep George he said whered you be then
You jest think of that me boy
By this time I was thoroughly miserable and frightened and this suggestion unnerved me dreadfully but I kept up an impenitent front
To wake in ell said Uncle Nicodemus in gentle tones
You dont want to wake in ell George burnin and screamin for ever do you
You wouldnt like that
He tried very hard to get me to jest ave a look at the bakeouse fire before I retired
It might move you he said
I was awake longest that night
My cousins slept the sleep of faith on either side of me
I decided I would whisper my prayers and stopped midway because I was ashamed and perhaps also because I had an idea one didnt square God like that
No I said with a sudden confidence damn me if youre coward enough
But youre not
No
You couldnt be
I woke my cousins up with emphatic digs and told them as much triumphantly and went very peacefully to sleep with my act of faith accomplished
I slept not only through that night but for all my nights since then
So far as any fear of Divine injustice goes I sleep soundly and shall I know to the end of things
That declaration was an epoch in my spiritual life
II But I didnt expect to have the whole meeting on Sunday turned on to me
It was
It all comes back to me that convergence of attention even the faint leathery smell of its atmosphere returns and the coarse feel of my aunts black dress beside me in contact with my hand
I see again the old Welsh milkman wrestling with me they all wrestled with me by prayer or exhortation
And I was holding out stoutly though convinced now by the contagion of their universal conviction that by doing so I was certainly and hopelessly damned
I felt that they were right that God was probably like them and that on the whole it didnt matter
And to simplify the business thoroughly I had declared I didnt believe anything at all
They confuted me by texts from Scripture which I now perceive was an illegitimate method of reply
When I got home still impenitent and eternally lost and secretly very lonely and miserable and alarmed Uncle Nicodemus docked my Sunday pudding
One person only spoke to me like a human being on that day of wrath and that was the younger Frapp
He came up to me in the afternoon while I was confined upstairs with a Bible and my own thoughts
Ello he said and fretted about
Dyou mean to say there isntno one he said funking the word
No one
No one watching yeralways
Why should there be
I asked
You cant elp thoughts said my cousin anyhow
You mean He stopped hovering
I spose I oughtnt to be talking to you
He hesitated and flitted away with a guilty back glance over his shoulder
The following week made life quite intolerable for me these people forced me at last into an Atheism that terrified me
When I learnt that next Sunday the wrestling was to be resumed my courage failed me altogether
I happened upon a map of Kent in a stationers window on Saturday and that set me thinking of one form of release
I studied it intently for half an hour perhaps on Saturday night got a route list of villages well fixed in my memory and got up and started for Bladesover about five on Sunday morning while my two bed mates were still fast asleep
III I remember something but not so much of it as I should like to recall of my long tramp to Bladesover House
The distance from Chatham is almost exactly seventeen miles and it took me until nearly one
It was very interesting and I do not think I was very fatigued though I got rather pinched by one boot
The morning must have been very clear because I remember that near Itchinstow Hall I looked back and saw the estuary of the Thames that river that has since played so large a part in my life
But at the time I did not know it was the Thames I thought this great expanse of mud flats and water was the sea which I had never yet seen nearly
And out upon it stood ships sailing ships and a steamer or so going up to London or down out into the great seas of the world
I stood for a long time watching these and thinking whether after all I should not have done better to have run away to sea
The nearer I drew to Bladesover the more doubtful I grew of the duality of my reception and the more I regretted that alternative
I suppose it was the dirty clumsiness of the shipping I had seen nearly that put me out of mind of that
I took a short cut through the Warren across the corner of the main park to intercept the people from the church
I wanted to avoid meeting any one before I met my mother and so I went to a place where the path passed between banks and without exactly hiding stood up among the bushes
This place among other advantages eliminated any chance of seeing Lady Drew who would drive round by the carriage road
Standing up to waylay in this fashion I had a queer feeling of brigandage as though I was some intrusive sort of bandit among these orderly things
It is the first time I remember having that outlaw feeling distinctly a feeling that has played a large part in my subsequent life
I felt there existed no place for me that I had to drive myself in
Presently down the hill the servants appeared straggling by twos and threes first some of the garden people and the butlers wife with them then the two laundry maids odd inseparable old creatures then the first footman talking to the butlers little girl and at last walking grave and breathless beside old Ann and Miss Fison the black figure of my mother
My boyish mind suggested the adoption of a playful form of appearance
Cooee mother said I coming out against the skyCooee
My mother looked up went very white and put her hand to her bosom
I suppose there was a fearful fuss about me
And of course I was quite unable to explain my reappearance
But I held out stoutly I wont go back to Chatham Ill drown myself first
The next day my mother carried me off to Wimblehurst took me fiercely and aggressively to an uncle I had never heard of before near though the place was to us
She gave me no word as to what was to happen and I was too subdued by her manifest wrath and humiliation at my last misdemeanour to demand information
I dont for one moment think Lady Drew was nice about me
The finality of my banishment was endorsed and underlined and stamped home
I wished very much now that I had run away to sea in spite of the coal dust and squalour Rochester had revealed to me
Perhaps over seas one came to different lands
IV I do not remember much of my journey to Wimblehurst with my mother except the image of her as sitting bolt upright as rather disdaining the thirdclass carriage in which we traveled and how she looked away from me out of the window when she spoke of my uncle
I have not seen your uncle she said since he was a boy She added grudgingly Then he was supposed to be clever
She took little interest in such qualities as cleverness
He married about three years ago and set up for himself in Wimblehurst
So I suppose she had some money
She mused on scenes she had long dismissed from her mind
Teddy she said at last in the tone of one who has been feeling in the dark and finds
He was called Teddy about your age Now he must be twentysix or seven
I thought of my uncle as Teddy directly I saw him there was something in his personal appearance that in the light of that memory phrased itself at once as Teddinessa certain Teddidity
To describe it in and other terms is more difficult
It is nimbleness without grace and alertness without intelligence
He whisked out of his shop upon the pavement a short figure in grey and wearing grey carpet slippers one had a sense of a young fattish face behind gilt glasses wiry hair that stuck up and forward over the forehead an irregular nose that had its aquiline moments and that the body betrayed an equatorial laxity an incipient bow window as the image goes
He jerked out of the shop came to a stand on the pavement outside regarded something in the window with infinite appreciation stroked his chin and as abruptly shot sideways into the door again charging through it as it were behind an extended hand
That must be him said my mother catching at her breath
We came past the window whose contents I was presently to know by heart a very ordinary chemists window except that there was a frictional electrical machine an air pump and two or three tripods and retorts replacing the customary blue yellow and red bottles above
There was a plaster of Paris horse to indicate veterinary medicines among these breakables and below were scent packets and diffusers and sponges and sodawater syphons and suchlike things
Only in the middle there was a rubricated card very neatly painted by hand with these words Buy Ponderevos Cough Linctus NOW
NOW
WHY
Twopence Cheaper than in Winter
You Store apples
why not the Medicine You are Bound to Need
in which appeal I was to recognise presently my uncles distinctive note
My uncles face appeared above a card of infants comforters in the glass pane of the door
I perceived his eyes were brown and that his glasses creased his nose
It was manifest he did not know us from Adam
A stare of scrutiny allowed an expression of commercial deference to appear in front of it and my uncle flung open the door
You dont know me
panted my mother
My uncle would not own he did not but his curiosity was manifest
My mother sat down on one of the little chairs before the soap and patent medicinepiled counter and her lips opened and closed
A glass of water madam said my uncle waved his hand in a sort of curve and shot away
My mother drank the water and spoke
That boy she said takes after his father
He grows more like him every day And so I have brought him to you
His father madam
George
For a moment the chemist was still at a loss
He stood behind the counter with the glass my mother had returned to him in his hand
Then comprehension grew
By Gosh
he said
Lord
he cried
His glasses fell off
He disappeared replacing them behind a pile of boxedup bottles of blood mixture
Eleven thousand virgins
I heard him cry
The glass was banged down
Oriental Gums
He shot away out of the shop through some masked door
One heard his voice
Susan
Susan
Then he reappeared with an extended hand
Well how are you
he said
I was never so surprised in my life
Fancy
You
He shook my mothers impassive hand and then mine very warmly holding his glasses on with his left forefinger
Come right in
he criedcome right in
Better late than never
and led the way into the parlour behind the shop
After Bladesover that apartment struck me as stuffy and petty but it was very comfortable in comparison with the Frapp livingroom
It had a faint disintegrating smell of meals about it and my most immediate impression was of the remarkable fact that something was hung about or wrapped round or draped over everything
There was brightpatterned muslin round the gasbracket in the middle of the room round the mirror over the mantel stuff with ballfringe along the mantel and casing in the fireplaceI first saw ballfringe hereand even the lamp on the little bureau wore a shade like a large muslin hat
The tablecloth had ballfringe and so had the window curtains and the carpet was a bed of roses
There were little cupboards on either side of the fireplace and in the recesses illmade shelves packed with books and enriched with pinked American cloth
There was a dictionary lying face downward on the table and the open bureau was littered with foolscap paper and the evidences of recently abandoned toil
My eye caught The Ponderevo Patent Flat a Machine you can Live in written in large firm letters
My uncle opened a little door like a cupboard door in the corner of this room and revealed the narrowest twist of staircase I had ever set eyes upon
Susan
he bawled again
Wantje
Some one to see you
Surprisin
There came an inaudible reply and a sudden loud bump over our heads as of some article of domestic utility pettishly flung aside then the cautious steps of someone descending the twist and then my aunt appeared in the doorway with her hand upon the jamb
Its Aunt Ponderevo cried my uncle
Georges wifeand shes brought over her son
His eye roamed about the room
He darted to the bureau with a sudden impulse and turned the sheet about the patent flat face down
Then he waved his glasses at us You know Susan my elder brother George
I told you about im lots of times
He fretted across to the hearthrug and took up a position there replaced his glasses and coughed
My aunt Susan seemed to be taking it in
She was then rather a pretty slender woman of twentythree or four I suppose and I remember being struck by the blueness of her eyes and the clear freshness of her complexion
She had little features a button nose a pretty chin and a long graceful neck that stuck out of her pale blue cotton morning dress
There was a look of halfassumed perplexity on her face a little quizzical wrinkle of the brow that suggested a faintly amused attempt to follow my uncles mental operations a vain attempt and a certain hopelessness that had in succession become habitual
She seemed to be saying Oh Lord
Whats he giving me THIS time
And as came to know her better I detected as a complication of her effort of apprehension a subsidiary riddle to Whats he giving me
and that wasto borrow a phrase from my schoolboy language Is it keeps
She looked at my mother and me and back to her husband again
You know he said
George
Well she said to my mother descending the last three steps of the staircase and holding out her hand
youre welcome
Though its a surprise
I cant ask you to HAVE anything Im afraid for there isnt anything in the house
She smiled and looked at her husband banteringly
Unless he makes up something with his old chemicals which hes quite equal to doing
My mother shook hands stiffly and told me to kiss my aunt Well lets all sit down said my uncle suddenly whistling through his clenched teeth and briskly rubbing his hands together
He put up a chair for my mother raised the blind of the little window lowered it again and returned to his hearthrug
Im sure he said as one who decides Im very glad to see you
V As they talked I gave my attention pretty exclusively to my uncle
I noted him in great detail
I remember now his partially unbuttoned waistcoat as though something had occurred to distract him as he did it up and a little cut upon his chin
I liked a certain humour in his eyes
I watched too with the fascination that things have for an observant boy the play of his lipsthey were a little oblique and there was something slipshod if one may strain a word so far about his mouth so that he lisped and sibilated ever and again and the coming and going of a curious expression triumphant in quality it was upon his face as he talked
He fingered his glasses which did not seem to fit his nose fretted with things in his waistcoat pockets or put his hands behind him looked over our heads and ever and again rose to his toes and dropped back on his heels
He had a way of drawing air in at times through his teeth that gave a whispering zest to his speech Its a sound I can only represent as a soft Zzzz
He did most of the talking
My mother repeated what she had already said in the shop I have brought George over to you and then desisted for a time from the real business in hand
You find this a comfortable house
she asked and this being affirmed It looksvery convenient Not too big to be a troubleno
You like Wimblehurst I suppose
My uncle retorted with some inquiries about the great people of Bladesover and my mother answered in the character of a personal friend of Lady Drews
The talk hung for a time and then my uncle embarked upon a dissertation upon Wimblehurst
This place he began isnt of course quite the place I ought to be in
My mother nodded as though she had expected that
It gives me no Scope he went on
Its deadandalive
Nothing happens
Hes always wanting something to happen said my aunt Susan
Some day hell get a shower of things and theyll be too much for him
Not they said my uncle buoyantly
Do you find businessslack
asked my mother
Oh
one rubs along
But theres no Developmentno growth
They just come along here and buy pills when they want emand a horseball or such
Theyve got to be ill before theres a prescription
That sort they are
You cant get em to launch out you cant get em to take up anything new
For instance Ive been trying latelyinduce them to buy their medicines in advance and in larger quantities
But they wont look for it
Then I tried to float a little notion of mine sort of an insurance scheme for colds you pay so much a week and when youve got a cold you get a bottle of Cough Linctus so long as you can produce a substantial sniff
See
But Lord
theyve no capacity for ideas they dont catch on no Jump about the place no Life
Livethey trickle and what one has to do here is to trickle too Zzzz
Ah
said my mother
It doesnt suit me said my uncle
Im the cascading sort
George was that said my mother after a pondering moment
My aunt Susan took up the parable with an affectionate glance at her husband
Hes always trying to make his old business jump she said
Always putting fresh cards in the window or getting up to something
Youd hardly believe
It makes ME jump sometimes
But it does no good said my uncle
It does no good said his wife
Its not his miloo Presently they came upon a wide pause
From the beginning of their conversation there had been the promise of this pause and I pricked my ears
I knew perfectly what was bound to come they were going to talk of my father
I was enormously strengthened in my persuasion when I found my mothers eyes resting thoughtfully upon me in the silence and than my uncle looked at me and then my aunt
I struggled unavailingly to produce an expression of meek stupidity
I think said my uncle that George will find it more amusing to have a turn in the marketplace than to sit here talking with us
Theres a pair of stocks there Georgevery interesting
Oldfashioned stocks
I dont mind sitting here I said
My uncle rose and in the most friendly way led me through the shop
He stood on his doorstep and jerked amiable directions to me
Aint it sleepy George eh
Theres the butchers dog over there asleep in the roadhalf an hour from midday
If the last Trump sounded I dont believe it would wake
Nobody would wake
The chaps up there in the churchyardtheyd just turn over and say Naaryou dont catch us you dont
See
Well youll find the stocks just round that corner
He watched me out of sight
So I never heard what they said about my father after all
VI When I returned my uncle had in some remarkable way become larger and central
Thachu George
he cried when the shopdoor bell sounded
Come right through and I found him as it were in the chairmans place before the draped grate
The three of them regarded me
We have been talking of making you a chemist George said my uncle
My mother looked at me
I had hoped she said that Lady Drew would have done something for him She stopped
In what way
said my uncle
She might have spoken to some one got him into something perhaps She had the servants invincible persuasion that all good things are done by patronage
He is not the sort of boy for whom things are done she added dismissing these dreams
He doesnt accommodate himself
When he thinks Lady Drew wishes a thing he seems not to wish it
Towards Mr Redgrave too he has beendisrespectfulhe is like his father
Whos Mr
Redgrave
The Vicar
A bit independent
said my uncle briskly
Disobedient said my mother
He has no idea of his place
He seems to think he can get on by slighting people and flouting them
Hell learn perhaps before it is too late
My uncle stroked his cut chin and me
Have you learnt any Latin
he asked abruptly
I said I had not
Hell have to learn a little Latin he explained to my mother to qualify
Hm
He could go down to the chap at the grammar school hereits just been routed into existence again by the Charity Commissioners and have lessons
What me learn Latin
I cried with emotion
A little he said
Ive always wanted I said and LATIN
I had long been obsessed by the idea that having no Latin was a disadvantage in the world and Archie Garvell had driven the point of this pretty earnestly home
The literature I had read at Bladesover had all tended that way
Latin had had a quality of emancipation for me that I find it difficult to convey
And suddenly when I had supposed all learning was at an end for me I heard this
Its no good to you of course said my uncle except to pass exams with but there you are
Youll have to learn Latin because you have to learn Latin said my mother not because you want to
And afterwards you will have to learn all sorts of other things The idea that I was to go on learning that to read and master the contents of books was still to be justifiable as a duty overwhelmed all other facts
I had had it rather clear in my mind for some weeks that all that kind of opportunity might close to me for ever
I began to take a lively interest in this new project
Then shall I live here
I asked with you and study as well as work in the shop
Thats the way of it said my uncle
I parted from my mother that day in a dream so sudden and important was this new aspect of things to me
I was to learn Latin
Now that the humiliation of my failure at Bladesover was past for her now that she had a little got over her first intense repugnance at this resort to my uncle and contrived something that seemed like a possible provision for my future the tenderness natural to a parting far more significant than any of our previous partings crept into her manner
She sat in the train to return I remember and I stood at the open door of her compartment and neither of us knew how soon we should cease for ever to be a trouble to one another
You must be a good boy George she said
You must learn And you mustnt set yourself up against those who are above you and better than you Or envy them
No mother I said
I promised carelessly
Her eyes were fixed upon me
I was wondering whether I could by any means begin Latin that night
Something touched her heart then some thought some memory perhaps some premonition
The solitary porter began slamming carriage doors
George she said hastily almost shamefully kiss me
I stepped up into her compartment as she bent downward
She caught me in her arms quite eagerly she pressed me to hera strange thing for her to do
I perceived her eyes were extraordinarily bright and then this brightness burst along the lower lids and rolled down her cheeks
For the first and last time in my life I saw my mothers tears
Then she had gone leaving me discomforted and perplexed forgetting for a time even that I was to learn Latin thinking of my mother as of something new and strange
The thing recurred though I sought to dismiss it it stuck itself into my memory against the day of fuller understanding
Poor proud habitual sternly narrow soul
poor difficult and misunderstanding son
it was the first time that ever it dawned upon me that my mother also might perhaps feel
VII My mother died suddenly and it was thought by Lady Drew inconsiderately the following spring
Her ladyship instantly fled to Folkestone with Miss Somerville and Fison until the funeral should be over and my mothers successor installed
My uncle took me over to the funeral
I remember there was a sort of prolonged crisis in the days preceding this because directly he heard of my loss he had sent a pair of check trousers to the Judkins people in London to be dyed black and they did not come back in time
He became very excited on the third day and sent a number of increasingly fiery telegrams without any result whatever and succumbed next morning with a very ill grace to my aunt Susans insistence upon the resources of his dresssuit
In my memory those black legs of his in a particularly thin and shiny black clothfor evidently his dresssuit dated from adolescent and slenderer daysstraddle like the Colossus of Rhodes over my approach to my mothers funeral
Moreover I was inconvenienced and distracted by a silk hat he had bought me my first silk hat much ennobled as his was also by a deep mourning band
I remember but rather indistinctly my mothers white paneled housekeepers room and the touch of oddness about it that she was not there and the various familiar faces made strange by black and I seem to recall the exaggerated selfconsciousness that arose out of their focussed attention
No doubt the sense of the new silk hat came and went and came again in my emotional chaos
Then something comes out clear and sorrowful rises out clear and sheer from among all these rather base and inconsequent things and once again I walk before all the other mourners close behind her coffin as it is carried along the churchyard path to her grave with the old vicars slow voice saying regretfully and unconvincingly above me triumphant solemn things
I am the resurrection and the life saith the Lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
Never die
The day was a high and glorious morning in spring and all the trees were budding and bursting into green
Everywhere there were blossoms and flowers the pear trees and cherry trees in the sextons garden were sunlit snow there were nodding daffodils and early tulips in the graveyard beds great multitudes of daisies and everywhere the birds seemed singing
And in the middle was the brown coffin end tilting on mens shoulders and half occluded by the vicars Oxford hood
And so we came to my mothers waiting grave
For a time I was very observant watching the coffin lowered hearing the words of the ritual
It seemed a very curious business altogether
Suddenly as the service drew to its end I felt something had still to be said which had not been said realised that she had withdrawn in silence neither forgiving me nor hearing from methose now lost assurances
Suddenly I knew I had not understood
Suddenly I saw her tenderly remembered not so much tender or kindly things of her as her crossed wishes and the ways in which I had thwarted her
Surprisingly I realised that behind all her hardness and severity she had loved me that I was the only thing she had ever loved and that until this moment I had never loved her
And now she was there and deaf and blind to me pitifully defeated in her designs for me covered from me so that she could not know
I dug my nails into the palms of my hands I set my teeth but tears blinded me sobs would have choked me had speech been required of me
The old vicar read on there came a mumbled responseand so on to the end
I wept as it were internally and only when we had come out of the churchyard could I think and speak calmly again
Stamped across this memory are the little black figures of my uncle and Rabbits telling Avebury the sexton and undertaker that it had all passed off very wellvery well indeed
VIII That is the last I shall tell of Bladesover
The dropscene falls on that and it comes no more as an actual presence into this novel
I did indeed go back there once again but under circumstances quite immaterial to my story
But in a sense Bladesover has never left me it is as I said at the outset one of those dominant explanatory impressions that make the framework of my mind
Bladesover illuminates England it has become all that is spacious dignified pretentious and truly conservative in English life
It is my social datum
That is why I have drawn it here on so large a scale
When I came back at last to the real Bladesover on an inconsequent visit everything was far smaller than I could have supposed possible
It was as though everything had shivered and shrivelled a little at the Lichtenstein touch
The harp was still in the saloon but there was a different grand piano with a painted lid and a metrostyle pianola and an extraordinary quantity of artistic litter and bricabrac scattered about
There was the trail of the Bond Street showroom over it all
The furniture was still under chintz but it wasnt the same sort of chintz although it pretended to be and the lustredangling chandeliers had passed away
Lady Lichtensteins books replaced the brown volumes I had browsed amongthey were mostly presentation copies of contemporary novels and the National Review and the Empire Review and the Nineteenth Century and after jostled current books on the tablesEnglish new books in gaudy catchpenny artistic covers French and Italian novels in yellow German art handbooks of almost incredible ugliness
There were abundant evidences that her ladyship was playing with the Keltic renascence and a great number of ugly cats made of chinashe collected china and stoneware catsstood about everywherein all colours in all kinds of deliberately comic highly glazed distortion
It is nonsense to pretend that finance makes any better aristocrats than rent
Nothing can make an aristocrat but pride knowledge training and the sword
These people were no improvement on the Drews none whatever
There was no effect of a beneficial replacement of passive unintelligent people by active intelligent ones
One felt that a smaller but more enterprising and intensely undignified variety of stupidity had replaced the large dullness of the old gentry and that was all
Bladesover I thought had undergone just the same change between the seventies and the new century that had overtaken the dear old Times and heaven knows how much more of the decorous British fabric
These Lichtensteins and their like seem to have no promise in them at all of any fresh vitality for the kingdom
I do not believe in their intelligence or their powerthey have nothing new about them at all nothing creative nor rejuvenescent no more than a disorderly instinct of acquisition and the prevalence of them and their kind is but a phase in the broad slow decay of the great social organism of England
They could not have made Bladesover they cannot replace it they just happen to break out over itsaprophytically
Wellthat was my last impression of Bladesover
CHAPTER THE THIRD THE WIMBLEHURST APPRENTICESHIP I So far as I can remember now except for that one emotional phase by the graveside I passed through all these experiences rather callously
I had already with the facility of youth changed my world ceased to think at all of the old school routine and put Bladesover aside for digestion at a latter stage
I took up my new world in Wimblehurst with the chemists shop as its hub set to work at Latin and materia medica and concentrated upon the present with all my heart
Wimblehurst is an exceptionally quiet and grey Sussex town rare among south of England towns in being largely built of stone
I found something very agreeable and picturesque in its clean cobbled streets its odd turnings and abrupt corners and in the pleasant park that crowds up one side of the town
The whole place is under the Eastry dominion and it was the Eastry influence and dignity that kept its railway station a mile and threequarters away
Eastry House is so close that it dominates the whole one goes across the marketplace with its old lockup and stocks past the great prereformation church a fine grey shell like some empty skull from which the life has fled and there at once are the huge wroughtiron gates and one peeps through them to see the facade of this place very white and large and fine down a long avenue of yews
Eastry was far greater than Bladesover and an altogether completer example of the eighteenth century system
It ruled not two villages but a borough that had sent its sons and cousins to parliament almost as a matter of right so long as its franchise endured
Every one was in the system every oneexcept my uncle
He stood out and complained
My uncle was the first real breach I found in the great front of Bladesover the world had presented me for Chatham was not so much a breach as a confirmation
But my uncle had no respect for Bladesover and Eastrynone whatever
He did not believe in them
He was blind even to what they were
He propounded strange phrases about them he exfoliated and wagged about novel and incredible ideas
This place said my uncle surveying it from his open doorway in the dignified stillness of a summer afternoon wants Waking Up
I was sorting up patent medicines in the corner
Id like to let a dozen young Americans loose into it said my uncle
Then wed see
I made a tick against Mother Shiptons Sleeping Syrup
We had cleared our forward stock
Things must be happening SOMEWHERE George he broke out in a querulously rising note as he came back into the little shop
He fiddled with the piled dummy boxes of fancy soap and scent and so forth that adorned the end of the counter then turned about petulantly stuck his hands deeply into his pockets and withdrew one to scratch his head
I must do SOMETHING he said
I cant stand it
I must invent something
And shove it
I could
Or a play
Theres a deal of money in a play George
What would you think of me writing a play eh
Theres all sorts of things to be done
Or the stogigschange
He fell into that meditative whistling of his
Sacramental wine
he swore this isnt the worldits Cold Mutton Fat
Thats what Wimblehurst is
Cold Mutton Fatdead and stiff
And Im buried in it up to the arm pits
Nothing ever happens nobody wants things to happen scept me
Up in London George things happen
America
I wish to Heaven George Id been born Americanwhere things hum
What can one do here
How can one grow
While were sleepin here with our Capital oozing away into Lord Eastrys pockets for rentmen are up there He indicated London as remotely over the top of the dispensing counter and then as a scene of great activity by a whirl of the hand and a wink and a meaning smile at me
What sort of things do they do
I asked
Rush about he said
Do things
Somethin glorious
Theres cover gambling
Ever heard of that George
He drew the air in through his teeth
You put down a hundred say and buy ten thousand pounds worth
See
Thats a cover of one per cent
Things go up one you sell realise cent per cent down whiff its gone
Try again
Cent per cent George every day
Men are made or done for in an hour
And the shoutin
Zzzz Well thats one way George
Then another waytheres Corners
Theyre rather big things arent they
I ventured
Oh if you go in for wheat or steelyes
But suppose you tackled a little thing George
Just some little thing that only needed a few thousands
Drugs for example
Shoved all you had into itstaked your liver on it so to speak
Take a drugtake ipecac for example
Take a lot of ipecac
Take all there is
See
There you are
There arent unlimited supplies of ipecacuanhacant beand its a thing people must have
Then quinine again
You watch your chance wait for a tropical war breaking out lets say and collar all the quinine
Where ARE they
Must have quinine you know
Eh
Zzzz
Lord
theres no end of thingsno end of little things
Dillwaterall the suffering babes yowling for it
Eucalyptus againcascarawitch hazelmentholall the toothache things
Then theres antiseptics and curare cocaine Rather a nuisance to the doctors I reflected
They got to look out for themselves
By Jove yes
Theyll do you if they can and you do them
Like brigands
That makes it romantic
Thats the Romance of Commerce George
Youre in the mountains there
Think of having all the quinine in the world and some millionaires pampered wife gone ill with malaria eh
Thats a squeeze George eh
Eh
Millionaire on his motor car outside offering you any price you liked
That ud wake up Wimblehurst Lord
You havent an Idea down here
Not an idea
Zzzz
He passed into a rapt dream from which escaped such fragments as Fifty per cent
advance sir securitytomorrow
Zzzz
The idea of cornering a drug struck upon my mind then as a sort of irresponsible monkey trick that no one would ever be permitted to do in reality
It was the sort of nonsense one would talk to make Ewart laugh and set him going on to still odder possibilities
I thought it was part of my uncles way of talking
But Ive learnt differently since
The whole trend of modern moneymaking is to foresee something that will presently be needed and put it out of reach and then to haggle yourself wealthy
You buy up land upon which people will presently want to build houses you secure rights that will bar vitally important developments and so on and so on
Of course the naive intelligence of a boy does not grasp the subtler developments of human inadequacy
He begins life with a disposition to believe in the wisdom of grownup people he does not realise how casual and disingenuous has been the development of law and custom and he thinks that somewhere in the state there is a power as irresistible as a head masters to check mischievous and foolish enterprises of every sort
I will confess that when my uncle talked of cornering quinine I had a clear impression that any one who contrived to do that would pretty certainly go to jail
Now I know that any one who could really bring it off would be much more likely to go to the House of Lords
My uncle ranged over the gilt labels of his bottles and drawers for a while dreaming of corners in this and that
But at last he reverted to Wimblehurst again
You got to be in London when these things are in hand
Down here
Jeerusalem
he cried
Why did I plant myself here
Everythings done
The games over
Heres Lord Eastry and hes got everything except what his lawyers get and before you get any more change this way youll have to dynamite himand them
HE doesnt want anything more to happen
Why should he
Any chance ud be a loss to him
He wants everything to burble along and burble along and go on as its going for the next ten thousand years Eastry after Eastry one parson down another come one grocer dead get another
Any one with any ideas better go away
They HAVE gone away
Look at all these blessed people in this place
Look at em
All fast asleep doing their business out of habitin a sort of dream Stuffed men would do just as welljust
Theyve all shook down into their places
THEY dont want anything to happen either
Theyre all broken in
There you are
Only what are they all alive for
Why cant they get a clockwork chemist
He concluded as he often concluded these talks
I must invent somethingthats about what I must do
Zzzz
Some convenience
Something people want Strike out You cant think George of anything everybody wants and hasnt got
I mean something you could turn out retail under a shilling say
Well YOU think whenever you havent got anything better to do
See
II So I remember my uncle in that first phase young but already a little fat restless fretful garrulous putting in my fermenting head all sorts of discrepant ideas
Certainly he was educational For me the years at Wimblehurst were years of pretty active growth
Most of my leisure and much of my time in the shop I spent in study
I speedily mastered the modicum of Latin necessary for my qualifying examinations anda little assisted by the Government Science and Art Department classes that were held in the Grammar Schoolwent on with my mathematics
There were classes in physics in chemistry in mathematics and machine drawing and I took up these subjects with considerable avidity
Exercise I got chiefly in the form of walks
There was some cricket in the summer and football in the winter sustained by young mens clubs that levied a parasitic blackmail of the big people and the sitting member but I was never very keen at these games
I didnt find any very close companions among the youths of Wimblehurst
They struck me after my cockney schoolmates as loutish and slow servile and furtive spiteful and mean
WE used to swagger but these countrymen dragged their feet and hated an equal who didnt we talked loud but you only got the real thoughts of Wimblehurst in a knowing undertone behind its hand
And even then they werent much in the way of thoughts
No I didnt like those young countrymen and Im no believer in the English countryside under the Bladesover system as a breeding ground for honourable men
One hears a frightful lot of nonsense about the Rural Exodus and the degeneration wrought by town life upon our population
To my mind the English townsman even in the slums is infinitely better spiritually more courageous more imaginative and cleaner than his agricultural cousin
Ive seen them both when they didnt think they were being observed and I know
There was something about my Wimblehurst companions that disgusted me
Its hard to define
Heaven knows that at that cockney boardingschool at Goudhurst we were coarse enough the Wimblehurst youngsters had neither words nor courage for the sort of thing we used to dofor our bad language for example but on the other hand they displayed a sort of sluggish real lewdness lewdness is the worda baseness of attitude
Whatever we exiled urbans did at Goudhurst was touched with something however coarse of romantic imagination
We had read the Boys of England and told each other stories
In the English countryside there are no books at all no songs no drama no valiant sin even all these things have never come or they were taken away and hidden generations ago and the imagination aborts and bestialises
That I think is where the real difference against the English rural man lies
It is because I know this that I do not share in the common repinings because our countryside is being depopulated because our population is passing through the furnace of the towns
They starve they suffer no doubt but they come out of it hardened they come out of it with souls
Of an evening the Wimblehurst blade shinyfaced from a wash and with some loud finery a coloured waistcoat or a vivid tie would betake himself to the Eastry Arms billiardroom or to the bar parlour of some minor pub where nap could be played
One soon sickened of his slow knowingness the cunning observation of his deadened eyes his idea of a good story always always told in undertones poor dirty worm
his shrewd elaborate maneuvers for some petty advantage a drink to the good or suchlike deal
There rises before my eyes as I write young Hopley Dodd the son of the Wimblehurst auctioneer the pride of Wimblehurst its finest flower with his fur waistcoat and his bulldog pipe his riding breecheshe had no horseand his gaiters as he used to sit leaning forward and watching the billiardtable from under the brim of his artfully tilted hat
A halfdozen phrases constituted his conversation hard lines
he used to say and Good baazness in a bass bleat
Moreover he had a long slow whistle that was esteemed the very cream of humorous comment
Night after night he was there
Also you knew he would not understand that I could play billiards and regarded every stroke I made as a fluke
For a beginner I didnt play so badly I thought
Im not so sure now that was my opinion at the time
But young Dodds scepticism and the good baazness finally cured me of my disposition to frequent the Eastry Arms and so these noises had their value in my world
I made no friends among the young men of the place at all and though I was entering upon adolescence I have no loveaffair to tell of here
Not that I was not waking up to that aspect of life in my middle teens I did indeed in various slightly informal ways scrape acquaintance with casual Wimblehurst girls with a little dressmakers apprentice I got upon shyly speaking terms and a pupil teacher in the National School went further and was talked about in connection with me but I was not by any means touched by any reality of passion for either of these young people lovelove as yet came to me only in my dreams
I only kissed these girls once or twice
They rather disconcerted than developed those dreams
They were so clearly not it
I shall have much to say of love in this story but I may break it to the reader now that it is my role to be a rather ineffectual lover
Desire I knew well enoughindeed too well but love I have been shy of
In all my early enterprises in the war of the sexes I was torn between the urgency of the body and a habit of romantic fantasy that wanted every phase of the adventure to be generous and beautiful
And I had a curiously haunting memory of Beatrice of her kisses in the bracken and her kiss upon the wall that somehow pitched the standard too high for Wimblehursts opportunities
I will not deny I did in a boyish way attempt a shy rude adventure or so in lovemaking at Wimblehurst but through these various influences I didnt bring things off to any extent at all
I left behind me no devastating memories no splendid reputation
I came away at last still inexperienced and a little thwarted with only a natural growth of interest and desire in sexual things
If I fell in love with any one in Wimblehurst it was with my aunt
She treated me with a kindliness that was only half maternalshe petted my books she knew about my certificates she made fun of me in a way that stirred my heart to her
Quite unconsciously I grew fond of her My adolescent years at Wimblehurst were on the whole laborious uneventful years that began in short jackets and left me in many ways nearly a man years so uneventful that the Calculus of Variations is associated with one winter and an examination in Physics for Science and Art department Honours marks an epoch
Many divergent impulses stirred within me but the master impulse was a grave young disposition to work and learn and thereby in some not very clearly defined way get out of the Wimblehurst world into which I had fallen
I wrote with some frequency to Ewart selfconscious but as I remember them not intelligent letters dated in Latin and with lapses into Latin quotation that roused Ewart to parody
There was something about me in those days more than a little priggish
But it was to do myself justice something more than the petty pride of learning
I had a very grave sense of discipline and preparation that I am not ashamed at all to remember
I was serious
More serious than I am at the present time
More serious indeed than any adult seems to be
I was capable then of effortsof nobilities
They are beyond me now
I dont see why at forty I shouldnt confess I respect my own youth
I had dropped being a boy quite abruptly
I thought I was presently to go out into a larger and quite important world and do significant things there
I thought I was destined to do something definite to a world that had a definite purpose
I did not understand then as I do now that life was to consist largely in the worlds doing things to me
Young people never do seem to understand that aspect of things
And as I say among my educational influences my uncle all unsuspected played a leading part and perhaps among other things gave my discontent with Wimblehurst my desire to get away from that clean and picturesque emptiness a form and expression that helped to emphasise it
In a way that definition made me patient
Presently I shall get to London I said echoing him
I remember him now as talking always talking in those days
He talked to me of theology he talked of politics of the wonders of science and the marvels of art of the passions and the affections of the immortality of the soul and the peculiar actions of drugs but predominantly and constantly he talked of getting on of enterprises of inventions and great fortunes of Rothschilds silver kings Vanderbilts Goulds flotations realisations and the marvelous ways of Chance with menin all localities that is to say that are not absolutely sunken to the level of Cold Mutton Fat
When I think of those early talks I figure him always in one of three positions
Either we were in the dispensing lair behind a high barrier he pounding up things in a mortar perhaps and I rolling pillstuff into long rolls and cutting it up with a sort of broad fluted knife or he stood looking out of the shop door against the case of sponges and spraydiffusers while I surveyed him from behind the counter or he leant against the little drawers behind the counter and I hovered dusting in front
The thought of those early days brings back to my nostrils the faint smell of scent that was always in the air marbled now with streaks of this drug and now of that and to my eyes the rows of jejune glass bottles with gold labels mirrorreflected that stood behind him
My aunt I remember used sometimes to come into the shop in a state of aggressive sprightliness a sort of connubial ragging expedition and get much fun over the abbreviated Latinity of those gilt inscriptions
Ol Amjig George she would read derisively and he pretends its almond oil
Snapand thats mustard
Did you ever George
Look at him George looking dignified
Id like to put an old label on to him round the middle like his bottles are with Ol Pondo on it
Thats Latin for Impostor George MUST be
Hed look lovely with a stopper
YOU want a stopper said my uncle projecting his face My aunt dear soul was in those days quite thin and slender with a delicate rosebud completion and a disposition to connubial badinage to a sort of gentle skylarking
There was a silvery ghost of lisping in her speech
She was a great humourist and as the constraint of my presence at meals wore off I became more and more aware of a filmy but extensive net of nonsense she had woven about her domestic relations until it had become the reality of her life
She affected a derisive attitude to the world at large and applied the epithet old to more things than I have ever heard linked to it before or since
Heres the old newspaper she used to sayto my uncle
Now dont go and get it in the butter you silly old Sardine
Whats the day of the week Susan
my uncle would ask
Old Monday Sossidge she would say and add I got all my Old Washing to do
Dont I KNOW it
She had evidently been the wit and joy of a large circle of schoolfellows and this style had become a second nature with her
It made her very delightful to me in that quiet place
Her customary walk even had a sort of hello
in it
Her chief preoccupation in life was I believe to make my uncle laugh and when by some new nickname some new quaintness or absurdity she achieved that end she was behind a mask of sober amazement the happiest woman on earth
My uncles laugh when it did come I must admit was as Baedeker says rewarding
It began with gusty blowings and snortings and opened into a clear Ha ha
but in fullest development it included in those youthful days falling about anyhow and doubling up tightly and whackings of the stomach and tears and cries of anguish
I never in my life heard my uncle laugh to his maximum except at her he was commonly too much in earnest for that and he didnt laugh much at all to my knowledge after those early years
Also she threw things at him to an enormous extent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of Wimblehurst sponges out of stock she threw cushions balls of paper clean washing bread and once up the yard when they thought that I and the errand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the way she smashed a boxful of eightounce bottles I had left to drain assaulting my uncle with a new soft broom
Sometimes she would shy things at mebut not often
There seemed always laughter round and about herall three of us would share hysterics at timesand on one occasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of themselves because of a storm of mirth during the sermon
The vicar it seems had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the customary pockethandkerchief
And afterwards she had picked up her own glove by the finger and looking innocently but intently sideways had suddenly by this simple expedient exploded my uncle altogether
We had it all over again at dinner
But it shows you cried my uncle suddenly becoming grave what Wimblehurst is to have us all laughing at a little thing like that
We werent the only ones that giggled
Not by any means
And Lord
it was funny
Socially my uncle and aunt were almost completely isolated
In places like Wimblehurst the tradesmens lives always are isolated socially all of them unless they have a sister or a bosom friend among the other wives but the husbands met in various barparlours or in the billiardroom of the Eastry Arms
But my uncle for the most part spent his evenings at home
When first he arrived in Wimblehurst I think he had spread his effect of abounding ideas and enterprise rather too aggressively and Wimblehurst after a temporary subjugation had rebelled and done its best to make a butt of him
His appearance in a publichouse led to a pause in any conversation that was going on
Come to tell us about everything Mr
Pondrevo
some one would say politely
You wait my uncle used to answer disconcerted and sulk for the rest of his visit
Or some one with an immense air of innocence would remark to the world generally Theyre talkin of rebuildin Wimblehurst all over again Im told
Anybody heard anything of it
Going to make it a reglar smartgoin enterprisin placekind of Crystal Pallas
Earthquake and a pestilence before you get that my uncle would mutter to the infinite delight of every one and add something inaudible about Cold Mutton Fat
III We were torn apart by a financial accident to my uncle of which I did not at first grasp the full bearings
He had developed what I regarded as an innocent intellectual recreation which he called stockmarket meteorology
I think he got the idea from one use of curves in the graphic presentation of associated variations that he saw me plotting
He secured some of my squared paper and having cast about for a time decided to trace the rise and fall of certain lines and railways
Theres something in this George he said and I little dreamt that among other things that were in it was the whole of his spare money and most of what my mother had left to him in trust for me
Its as plain as can be he said
See heres one system of waves and heres another
These are prices for Union Pacificsextending over a month
Now next week mark my words theyll be down one whole point
Were getting near the steep part of the curve again
See
Its absolutely scientific
Its verifiable
Well and apply it
You buy in the hollow and sell on the crest and there you are
I was so convinced of the triviality of this amusement that to find at last that he had taken it in the most disastrous earnest overwhelmed me
He took me for a long walk to break it to me over the hills towards Yare and across the great gorse commons by Hazelbrow
There are ups and downs in life George he saidhalfway across that great open space and paused against the skyI left out one factor in the Union Pacific analysis
DID you
I said struck by the sudden chance in his voice
But you dont mean
I stopped and turned on him in the narrow sandy rut of pathway and he stopped likewise
I do George
I DO mean
Its bust me
Im a bankrupt here and now
Then
The shops bust too
I shall have to get out of that
And me
Oh youYOURE all right
You can transfer your apprenticeship anderwell Im not the sort of man to be careless with trust funds you can be sure
I kept that aspect in mind
Theres some of it left Georgetrust mequite a decent little sum
But you and aunt
It isnt QUITE the way we meant to leave Wimblehurst George but we shall have to go
Sale all the things shoved about and ticketedlot a hundred and one
Ugh
Its been a larky little house in some ways
The first we had
Furnishinga spree in its way
Very happy His face winced at some memory
Lets go on George he said shortly near choking I could see
I turned my back on him and did not look round again for a little while
Thats how it is you see George
I heard him after a time
When we were back in the high road again he came alongside and for a time we walked in silence
Dont say anything home yet he said presently
Fortunes of War
I got to pick the proper time with Susanelse shell get depressed
Not that she isnt a firstrate brick whatever comes along
All right I said Ill be careful and it seemed to me for the time altogether too selfish to bother him with any further inquiries about his responsibility as my trustee
He gave a little sigh of relief at my note of assent and was presently talking quite cheerfully of his plans
But he had I remember one lapse into moodiness that came and went suddenly
Those others
he said as though the thought had stung him for the first time
What others
I asked
Damn them
said he
But what others
All those damned stickinthemudanddieslowly tradespeople Ruck the butcher Marbel the grocer
Snape
Gord
George HOW theyll grin
I thought him over in the next few weeks and I remember now in great detail the last talk we had together before he handed over the shop and me to his successor
For he had the good luck to sell his business lock stock and barrelin which expression I found myself and my indentures included
The horrors of a sale by auction of the furniture even were avoided
I remember that either coming or going on that occasion Ruck the butcher stood in his doorway and regarded us with a grin that showed his long teeth
You halfwitted hog
said my uncle
You grinning hyaena and then Pleasant day Mr
Ruck
Goin to make your fortun in London then
said Mr Ruck with slow enjoyment
That last excursion took us along the causeway to Beeching and so up the downs and round almost as far as Steadhurst home
My moods as we went made a mingled web
By this time I had really grasped the fact that my uncle had in plain English robbed me the little accumulations of my mother six hundred pounds and more that would have educated me and started me in business had been eaten into and was mostly gone into the unexpected hollow that ought to have been a crest of the Union Pacific curve and of the remainder he still gave no account
I was too young and inexperienced to insist on this or know how to get it but the thought of it all made streaks of decidedly black anger in that scheme of interwoven feelings
And you know I was also acutely sorry for himalmost as sorry as I was for my aunt Susan
Even then I had quite found him out
I knew him to be weaker than myself his incurable irresponsible childishness was as clear to me then as it was on his deathbed his redeeming and excusing imaginative silliness
Through some odd mental twist perhaps I was disposed to exonerate him even at the cost of blaming my poor old mother who had left things in his untrustworthy hands
I should have forgiven him altogether I believe if he had been in any manner apologetic to me but he wasnt that
He kept reassuring me in a way I found irritating
Mostly however his solicitude was for Aunt Susan and himself
Its these Crises George he said try Character
Your aunts come out well my boy
He made meditative noises for a space
Had her cry of coursethe thing had been only too painfully evident to me in her eyes and swollen facewho wouldnt
But nowbuoyant again
Shes a Corker
Well be sorry to leave the little house of course
Its a bit like Adam and Eve you know
Lord
what a chap old Milton was
The world was all before them where to choose Their place of rest and Providence their guide
It sounds George Providence their guide
Wellthank goodness theres no imeedgit prospect of either Cain or Abel
After all it wont be so bad up there
Not the scenery perhaps or the air we get here butLIFE
Weve got very comfortable little rooms very comfortable considering and I shall rise
Were not done yet were not beaten dont think that George
I shall pay twenty shillings in the pound before Ive doneyou mark my words Georgetwentyfive to you
I got this situation within twentyfour hoursothers offered
Its an important firmone of the best in London
I looked to that
I might have got four or five shillings a week moreelsewhere
Quarters I could name
But I said to them plainly wages to go on with but opportunitys my gamedevelopment
We understood each other
He threw out his chest and the little round eyes behind his glasses rested valiantly on imaginary employers
We would go on in silence for a space while he revised and restated that encounter
Then he would break out abruptly with some banal phrase
The Battle of Life George my boy he would cry or Ups and Downs
He ignored or waived the poor little attempts I made to ascertain my own position
Thats all right he would say or Leave all that to me
ILL look after them
And he would drift away towards the philosophy and moral of the situation
What was I to do
Never put all your resources into one chance George thats the lesson I draw from this
Have forces in reserve
It was a hundred to one George that I was righta hundred to one
I worked it out afterwards
And here we are spiked on the offchance
If Id have only kept back a little Id have had it on UP
next day like a shot and come out on the rise
There you are
His thoughts took a graver turn
Its where youll bump up against Chance like this George that you feel the need of religion
Your hardandfast scientific menyour Spencers and Huxleysthey dont understand that
I do
Ive thought of it a lot latelyin bed and about
I was thinking of it this morning while I shaved
Its not irreverent for me to say it I hopebut God comes in on the offchance George
See
Dont you be too cocksure of anything good or bad
Thats what I make out of it
I could have sworn
Well do you think Iparticular as I amwould have touched those Union Pacifics with trust money at all if I hadnt thought it a thoroughly good thinggood without spot or blemish
And it was bad
Its a lesson to me
You start in to get a hundred percent
and you come out with that
It means in a way a reproof for Pride
Ive thought of that Georgein the Night Watches
I was thinking this morning when I was shaving that thats where the good of it all comes in
At the bottom Im a mystic in these affairs
You calculate youre going to do this or that but at bottom who knows at all WHAT hes doing
When you most think youre doing things theyre being done right over your head
YOURE being donein a sense
Take a hundredto one chance or one to a hundredwhat does it matter
Youre being Led
Its odd that I heard this at the time with unutterable contempt and now that I recall itwell I ask myself what have I got better
I wish said I becoming for a moment outrageous YOU were being Led to give me some account of my money uncle
Not without a bit of paper to figure on George I cant
But you trust me about that never fear
You trust me
And in the end I had to
I think the bankruptcy hit my aunt pretty hard
There was so far as I can remember now a complete cessation of all those cheerful outbreaks of elasticity no more skylarking in the shop nor scampering about the house
But there was no fuss that I saw and only little signs in her complexion of the fits of weeping that must have taken her
She didnt cry at the end though to me her face with its strain of selfpossession was more pathetic than any weeping
Well she said to me as she came through the shop to the cab Heres old orf George
Orf to Mome number two
Goodbye
And she took me in her arms and kissed me and pressed me to her
Then she dived straight for the cab before I could answer her
My uncle followed and he seemed to me a trifle too valiant and confident in his bearing for reality
He was unusually white in the face
He spoke to his successor at the counter
Here we go
he said
One down the other up
Youll find it a quiet little business so long as you run it on quiet linesa nice quiet little business
Theres nothing more
No
Well if you want to know anything write to me
Ill always explain fully
Anythingbusiness place or people
Youll find Pil Antibil
a little overstocked bytheby I found it soothed my mind the day before yesterday making em and I made em all day
Thousands
And wheres George
Ah
there you are
Ill write to you George FULLY about all that affair
Fully
It became clear to me as if for the first time that I was really parting from my aunt Susan
I went out on to the pavement and saw her head craned forward her wideopen blue eyes and her little face intent on the shop that had combined for her all the charms of a big dolls house and a little home of her very own
Goodbye
she said to it and to me
Our eyes met for a momentperplexed
My uncle bustled out and gave a few totally unnecessary directions to the cabman and got in beside her
All right
asked the driver
Right said I and he woke up the horse with a flick of his whip
My aunts eyes surveyed me again
Stick to your old science and things George and write and tell me when they make you a Professor she said cheerfully
She stared at me for a second longer with eyes growing wider and brighter and a smile that had become fixed glanced again at the bright little shop still saying Ponderevo with all the emphasis of its fascia and then flopped back hastily out of sight of me into the recesses of the cab
Then it had gone from before me and I beheld Mr Snape the hairdresser inside his store regarding its departure with a quiet satisfaction and exchanging smiles and significant headshakes with Mr Marbel
IV I was left I say as part of the lock stock and barrel at Wimblehurst with my new master a Mr Mantell who plays no part in the progress of this story except in so far as he effaced my uncles traces
So soon as the freshness of this new personality faded I began to find Wimblehurst not only a dull but a lonely place and to miss my aunt Susan immensely
The advertisements of the summer terms for Cough Linctus were removed the bottles of coloured waterred green and yellowrestored to their places the horse announcing veterinary medicine which my uncle sizzling all the while had coloured in careful portraiture of a Goodwood favourite rewhitened and I turned myself even more resolutely than before to Latin until the passing of my preliminary examination enabled me to drop that and then to mathematics and science
There were classes in Electricity and Magnetism at the Grammar School
I took a little elementary prize in that in my first year and a medal in my third and in Chemistry and Human Physiology and Sound Light and Heat I did well
There was also a lighter more discursive subject called Physiography in which one ranged among the sciences and encountered Geology as a process of evolution from Eozoon to Eastry House and Astronomy as a record of celestial movements of the most austere and invariable integrity
I learnt out of badlywritten condensed little textbooks and with the minimum of experiment but still I learnt
Only thirty years ago it was and I remember I learnt of the electric light as an expensive impracticable toy the telephone as a curiosity electric traction as a practical absurdity
There was no argon no radium no phagocytesat least to my knowledge and aluminium was a dear infrequent metal
The fastest ships in the world went then at nineteen knots and no one but a lunatic here and there ever thought it possible that men might fly
Many things have happened since then but the last glance I had of Wimblehurst two years ago remarked no change whatever in its pleasant tranquillity
They had not even built any fresh housesat least not actually in the town though about the station there had been some building
But it was a good place to do work in for all its quiescence
I was soon beyond the small requirements of the Pharmaceutical Societys examination and as they do not permit candidates to sit for that until one and twenty I was presently filling up my time and preventing my studies becoming too desultory by making an attack upon the London University degree of Bachelor of Science which impressed me then as a very splendid but almost impossible achievement
The degree in mathematics and chemistry appealed to me as particularly congenialalbeit giddily inaccessible
I set to work
I had presently to arrange a holiday and go to London to matriculate and so it was I came upon my aunt and uncle again
In many ways that visit marked an epoch
It was my first impression of London at all
I was then nineteen and by a conspiracy of chances my nearest approach to that human wilderness had been my brief visit to Chatham
Chatham too had been my largest town
So that I got London at last with an exceptional freshness of effect as the sudden revelation of a whole unsuspected other side to life
I came to it on a dull and smoky day by the South Eastern Railway and our train was half an hour late stopping and going on and stopping again
I marked beyond Chiselhurst the growing multitude of villas and so came stage by stage through multiplying houses and diminishing interspaces of market garden and dingy grass to regions of interlacing railway lines big factories gasometers and wide reeking swamps of dingy little homes more of them and more and more
The number of these and their dinginess and poverty increased and here rose a great public house and here a Board School and there a gaunt factory and away to the east there loomed for a time a queer incongruous forest of masts and spars
The congestion of houses intensified and piled up presently into tenements I marveled more and more at this boundless world of dingy people whiffs of industrial smell of leather of brewing drifted into the carriage the sky darkened I rumbled thunderously over bridges vancrowded streets peered down on and crossed the Thames with an abrupt eclat of sound
I got an effect of tall warehouses of grey water barge crowded of broad banks of indescribable mud and then I was in Cannon Street Stationa monstrous dirty cavern with trains packed across its vast floor and more porters standing along the platform than I had ever been in my life before
I alighted with my portmanteau and struggled along realising for the first time just how small and weak I could still upon occasion feel
In this world I felt an Honours medal in Electricity and magnetism counted for nothing at all
Afterwards I drove in a cab down a canon of rushing street between high warehouses and peeped up astonished at the blackened greys of Saint Pauls
The traffic of Cheapsideit was mostly in horse omnibuses in those daysseemed stupendous its roar was stupendous I wondered where the money came from to employ so many cabs what industry could support the endless jostling stream of silkhatted frockcoated hurrying men
Down a turning I found the Temperance Hotel Mr Mantell had recommended to me
The porter in a green uniform who took over my portmanteau seemed I thought to despise me a good deal
V Matriculation kept me for four full days and then came an afternoon to spare and I sought out Tottenham Court Road through a perplexing network of various and crowded streets
But this London was vast
it was endless
it seemed the whole world had changed into packed frontages and hoardings and street spaces
I got there at last and made inquiries and I found my uncle behind the counter of the pharmacy he managed an establishment that did not impress me as doing a particularly highclass trade
Lord
he said at the sight of me I was wanting something to happen
He greeted me warmly
I had grown taller and he I thought had grown shorter and smaller and rounder but otherwise he was unchanged
He struck me as being rather shabby and the silk hat he produced and put on when after mysterious negotiations in the back premises he achieved his freedom to accompany me was past its first youth but he was as buoyant and confident as ever
Come to ask me about all THAT he cried
Ive never written yet
Oh among other things said I with a sudden regrettable politeness and waived the topic of his trusteeship to ask after my aunt Susan
Well have her out of it he said suddenly well go somewhere
We dont get you in London every day
Its my first visit I said Ive never seen London before and that made him ask me what I thought of it and the rest of the talk was London London to the exclusion of all smaller topics
He took me up the Hampstead Road almost to the Cobden statue plunged into some back streets to the left and came at last to a blistered front door that responded to his latchkey one of a long series of blistered front doors with fanlights and apartment cards above
We found ourselves in a drabcoloured passage that was not only narrow and dirty but desolatingly empty and then he opened a door and revealed my aunt sitting at the window with a little sewingmachine on a bamboo occasional table before her and worka plumcoloured walking dress I judged at its most analytical stagescattered over the rest of the apartment
At the first glance I judged my aunt was plumper than she had been but her complexion was just as fresh and her China blue eye as bright as in the old days
London she said didnt get blacks on her
She still cheeked my uncle I was pleased to find
What are you old Poking in for at THIS timeGubbitt she said when he appeared and she still looked with a practised eye for the facetious side of things
When she saw me behind him she gave a little cry and stood up radiant
Then she became grave
I was surprised at my own emotion in seeing her
She held me at arms length for a moment a hand on each shoulder and looked at me with a sort of glad scrutiny
She seemed to hesitate and then pecked little kiss off my cheek
Youre a man George she said as she released me and continued to look at me for a while
Their menage was one of a very common type in London
They occupied what is called the diningroom floor of a small house and they had the use of a little inconvenient kitchen in the basement that had once been scullery
The two rooms bedroom behind and living room in front were separated by foldingdoors that were never now thrown back and indeed in the presence of a visitor not used at all
There was of course no bathroom or anything of that sort available and there was no water supply except to the kitchen below
My aunt did all the domestic work though she could have afforded to pay for help if the build of the place had not rendered that inconvenient to the pitch of impossibility
There was no sort of help available except that of indoor servants for whom she had no accommodation
The furniture was their own it was partly secondhand but on the whole it seemed cheerful to my eye and my aunts bias for cheap gayfigured muslin had found ample score
In many ways I should think it must have been an extremely inconvenient and cramped sort of home but at the time I took it as I was taking everything as being there and in the nature of things
I did not see the oddness of solvent decent people living in a habitation so clearly neither designed nor adapted for their needs so wasteful of labour and so devoid of beauty as this was and it is only now as I describe this that I find myself thinking of the essential absurdity of an intelligent community living in such makeshift homes
It strikes me now as the next thing to wearing secondhand clothes
You see it was a natural growth part of that system to which Bladesover I hold is the key
There are wide regions of London miles of streets of houses that appear to have been originally designed for prosperousmiddleclass homes of the early Victorian type
There must have been a perfect fury of such building in the thirties forties and fifties
Street after street must have been rushed into being Campden Town way Pentonville way Brompton way West Kensington way in the Victoria region and all over the minor suburbs of the south side
I am doubtful if many of these houses had any long use as the residences of single families if from the very first almost their tenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet
They were built with basements in which their servants worked and livedservants of a more submissive and troglodytic generation who did not mind stairs
The diningroom with folding doors was a little above the ground level and in that the wholesome boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes and then pie to follow was consumed and the numerous family read and worked in the evening and above was the drawingroom also with folding doors where the infrequent callers were received
That was the vision at which those industrious builders aimed
Even while these houses were being run up the threads upon the loom of fate were shaping to abolish altogether the type of household that would have fitted them
Means of transit were developing to carry the moderately prosperous middleclass families out of London education and factory employment were whittling away at the supply of rough hardworking obedient girls who would stand the subterranean drudgery of these places new classes of hardup middleclass people such as my uncle employees of various types were coming into existence for whom no homes were provided
None of these classes have ideas of what they ought to be or fit in any legitimate way into the Bladesover theory that dominates our minds
It was nobodys concern to see them housed under civilised conditions and the beautiful laws of supply and demand had free play
They had to squeeze in
The landlords came out financially intact from their blundering enterprise
More and more these houses fell into the hands of married artisans or struggling widows or old servants with savings who became responsible for the quarterly rent and tried to sweat a living by subletting furnished or unfurnished apartments
I remember now that a poor greyhaired old woman who had an air of having been roused from a nap in the dust bin came out into the area and looked up at us as we three went out from the front door to see London under my uncles direction
She was the subletting occupier she squeezed out a precarious living by taking the house whole and subletting it in detail and she made her food and got the shelter of an attic above and a basement below by the transaction
And if she didnt chance to let steadily out she went to pauperdom and some other poor sordid old adventurer tried in her place
It is a foolish community that can house whole classes useful and helpful honest and loyal classes in such squalidly unsuitable dwellings
It is by no means the social economy it seems to use up old women savings and inexperience in order to meet the landlords demands
But any one who doubts this thing is going on right up to today need only spend an afternoon in hunting for lodgings in any of the regions of London I have named
But where has my story got to
My uncle I say decided I must be shown London and out we three went as soon as my aunt had got her hat on to catch all that was left of the day
VI It pleased my uncle extremely to find I had never seen London before
He took possession of the metropolis forthwith
London George he said takes a lot of understanding
Its a great place
Immense
The richest town in the world the biggest port the greatest manufacturing town the Imperial citythe centre of civilisation the heart of the world
See those sandwich men down there
That third ones hat
Fair treat
You dont see poverty like that in Wimblehurst George
And many of them high Oxford honour men too
Brought down by drink
Its a wonderful place Georgea whirlpool a maelstrom
whirls you up and whirls you down
I have a very confused memory of that afternoons inspection of London
My uncle took us to and fro showing us over his London talking erratically following a route of his own
Sometimes we were walking sometimes we were on the tops of great staggering horse omnibuses in a heaving jumble of traffic and at one point we had tea in an Aerated Bread Shop
But I remember very distinctly how we passed down Park Lane under an overcast sky and how my uncle pointed out the house of this child of good fortune and that with succulent appreciation
I remember too that as he talked I would find my aunt watching my face as if to check the soundness of his talk by my expression
Been in love yet George
she asked suddenly over a bun in the teashop
Too busy aunt I told her
She bit her bun extensively and gesticulated with the remnant to indicate that she had more to say
How are YOU going to make your fortune
she said so soon as she could speak again
You havent told us that
Lectricity said my uncle taking breath after a deep draught of tea
If I make it at all I said
For my part I think shall be satisfied with something less than a fortune
Were going to make ourssuddenly she said
So HE old says
She jerked her head at my uncle
He wont tell me whenso I cant get anything ready
But its coming
Going to ride in our carriage and have a garden
Gardenlike a bishops
She finished her bun and twiddled crumbs from her fingers
I shall be glad of the garden she said
Its going to be a real big one with rosaries and things
Fountains in it
Pampas grass
Hothouses
Youll get it all right said my uncle who had reddened a little
Grey horses in the carriage George she said
Its nice to think about when ones dull
And dinners in restaurants often and often
And theatresin the stalls
And money and money and money
You may joke said my uncle and hummed for a moment
Just as though an old Porpoise like him would ever make money she said turning her eyes upon his profile with a sudden lapse to affection
Hell just porpoise about
Ill do something said my uncle you bet
Zzzz
and rapped with a shilling on the marble table
When you do youll have to buy me a new pair of gloves she said anyhow
That fingers past mending
Look
you Cabbageyou
And she held the split under his nose and pulled a face of comical fierceness
My uncle smiled at these sallies at the time but afterwards when I went back with him to the Pharmacythe lowclass business grew brisker in the evening and they kept open latehe reverted to it in a low expository tone
Your aunts a bit impatient George
She gets at me
Its only natural A woman doesnt understand how long it takes to build up a position
No
In certain directions nowI amquietlybuilding up a position
Now here
I get this room
I have my three assistants
Zzzz
Its a position that judged by the criterion of imeedjit income isnt perhaps so good as I deserve but strategicallyyes
Its what I want
I make my plans
I rally my attack
What plans I said are you making
Well George theres one thing you can rely upon Im doing nothing in a hurry
I turn over this one and that and I dont talkindiscreetly
Theres No
I dont think I can tell you that
And yet why NOT
He got up and closed the door into the shop
Ive told no one he remarked as he sat down again
I owe you something
His face flushed slightly he leant forward over the little table towards me
Listen
he said
I listened
TonoBungay said my uncle very slowly and distinctly
I thought he was asking me to hear some remote strange noise
I dont hear anything I said reluctantly to his expectant face
He smiled undefeated
Try again he said and repeated TonoBungay
Oh THAT
I said
Eh
said he
But what is it
Ah
said my uncle rejoicing and expanding
What IS it
Thats what you got to ask
What wont it be
He dug me violently in what he supposed to be my ribs
George he criedGeorge watch this place
Theres more to follow
And that was all I could get from him
That I believe was the very first time that the words TonoBungay ever heard on earthunless my uncle indulged in monologues in his chambera highly probable thing
Its utterance certainly did not seem to me at the time to mark any sort of epoch and had I been told this word was the Open Sesame to whatever pride and pleasure the grimy front of London hid from us that evening I should have laughed aloud
Coming now to business I said after a pause and with a chill sense of effort and I opened the question of his trust
My uncle sighed and leant back in his chair
I wish I could make all this business as clear to you as it is to me he said
HoweverGo on
Say what you have to say
VII After I left my uncle that evening I gave way to a feeling of profound depression
My uncle and aunt seemed to me to be leadingI have already used the word too often but I must use it againDINGY lives
They seemed to be adrift in a limitless crowd of dingy people wearing shabby clothes living uncomfortably in shabby secondhand houses going to and fro on pavements that had always a thin veneer of greasy slippery mud under grey skies that showed no gleam of hope of anything for them but dinginess until they died
It seemed absolutely clear to me that my mothers little savings had been swallowed up and that my own prospect was all too certainly to drop into and be swallowed up myself sooner or later by this dingy London ocean
The London that was to be an adventurous escape from the slumber of Wimblehurst had vanished from my dreams
I saw my uncle pointing to the houses in Park Lane and showing a frayed shirtcuff as he did so
I heard my aunt Im to ride in my carriage then
So he old says
My feelings towards my uncle were extraordinarily mixed
I was intensely sorry not only for my aunt Susan but for himfor it seemed indisputable that as they were living then so they must go onand at the same time I was angry with the garrulous vanity and illness that had elipped all my chance of independent study and imprisoned her in those grey apartments
When I got back to Wimblehurst I allowed myself to write him a boyishly sarcastic and sincerely bitter letter
He never replied
Then believing it to be the only way of escape for me I set myself far more grimly and resolutely to my studies than I had ever done before
After a time I wrote to him in more moderate terms and he answered me evasively
And then I tried to dismiss him from my mind and went on working
Yes that first raid upon London under the moist and chilly depression of January had an immense effect upon me
It was for me an epochmaking disappointment
I had thought of London as a large free welcoming adventurous place and I saw it slovenly and harsh and irresponsive
I did not realise at all what human things might be found behind those grey frontages what weakness that whole forbidding facade might presently confess
It is the constant error of youth to overestimate the Will in things
I did not see that the dirt the discouragement the discomfort of London could be due simply to the fact that London was a witless old giantess of a town too slack and stupid to keep herself clean and maintain a brave face to the word
No
I suffered from the sort of illusion that burnt witches in the seventeenth century
I endued her grubby disorder with a sinister and magnificent quality of intention
And my uncles gestures and promises filled me with doubt and a sort of fear for him
He seemed to me a lost little creature too silly to be silent in a vast implacable condemnation
I was full of pity and a sort of tenderness for my aunt Susan who was doomed to follow his erratic fortunes mocked by his grandiloquent promises
I was to learn better
But I worked with the terror of the grim underside of London in my soul during all my last year at Wimblehurst
BOOK THE SECOND THE RISE OF TONOBUNGAY CHAPTER THE FIRST HOW I BECAME A LONDON STUDENT AND WENT ASTRAY I came to live in London as I shall tell you when I was nearly twentytwo
Wimblehurst dwindles in perspective is now in this book a little place far off Bladesover no more than a small pinkish speck of frontage among the distant Kentish hills the scene broadens out becomes multitudinous and limitless full of the sense of vast irrelevant movement
I do not remember my second coming to London as I do my first for my early impressions save that an October memory of softened amber sunshine stands out amber sunshine falling on grey house fronts I know not where
That and a sense of a large tranquillity
I could fill a book I think with a more or less imaginary account of how I came to apprehend London how first in one aspect and then in another it grew in my mind
Each day my accumulating impressions were added to and qualified and brought into relationship with new ones they fused inseparably with others that were purely personal and accidental
I find myself with a certain comprehensive perception of London complete indeed incurably indistinct in places and yet in some way a whole that began with my first visit and is still being mellowed and enriched
London
At first no doubt it was a chaos of streets and people and buildings and reasonless going to and fro
I do not remember that I ever struggled very steadily to understand it or explored it with any but a personal and adventurous intention
Yet in time there has grown up in me a kind of theory of London I do think I see lines of an ordered structure out of which it has grown detected a process that is something more than a confusion of casual accidents though indeed it may be no more than a process of disease
I said at the outset of my first book that I find in Bladesover the clue to all England
Well I certainly imagine it is the clue to the structure of London
There have been no revolutions no deliberate restatements or abandonments of opinion in England since the days of the fine gentry since 1688 or thereabouts the days when Bladesover was built there have been changes dissolving forest replacing forest if you will but then it was that the broad lines of the English system set firmly
And as I have gone to and fro in London in certain regions constantly the thought has recurred this is Bladesover House this answers to Bladesover House
The fine gentry may have gone they have indeed largely gone I think rich merchants may have replaced them financial adventurers or what not
That does not matter the shape is still Bladesover
I am most reminded of Bladesover and Eastry by all those regions round about the West End parks for example estate parks each more or less in relation to a palace or group of great houses
The roads and back ways of Mayfair and all about St Jamess again albeit perhaps of a later growth in point of time were of the very spirit and architectural texture of the Bladesover passages and yards they had the same smells the space the large cleanest and always going to and fro where one met unmistakable Olympians and even more unmistakable valets butlers footmen in mufti
There were moments when I seemed to glimpse down areas the white panelling the very chintz of my mothers room again
I could trace out now on a map what I would call the GreatHouse region passing southwestward into Belgravia becoming diffused and sporadic westward finding its last systematic outbreak round and about Regents Park
The Duke of Devonshires place in Piccadilly in all its insolent ugliness pleases me particularly it is the quintessence of the thing Apsley House is all in the manner of my theory Park Lane has its quite typical mansions and they run along the border of the Green Park and St Jamess
And I struck out a truth one day in Cromwell Road quite suddenly as I looked over the Natural History Museum By Jove said I but this is the little assemblage of cases of stuffed birds and animals upon the Bladesover staircase grown enormous and yonder as the corresponding thing to the Bladesover curios and porcelain is the Art Museume and there in the little observatories in Exhibition Road is old Sir Cuthberts Gregorian telescope that I hunted out in the storeroom and put together
And diving into the Art Museum under this inspiration I came to a little readingroom and found as I had inferred old brown books
It was really a good piece of social comparative anatomy I did that day all these museums and libraries that are dotted over London between Piccadilly and West Kensington and indeed the museum and library movement throughout the world sprang from the elegant leisure of the gentlemen of taste
Theirs were the
first libraries the first houses of culture by my ratlike raids into the Bladesover saloon I became as it were the last dwindled representative of such a man of letters as Swift
But now these things have escaped out of the Great House altogether and taken on a strange independent life of their own
It is this idea of escaping parts from the seventeenth century system of Bladesover of proliferating and overgrowing elements from the Estates that to this day seems to me the best explanation not simply of London but of all England
England is a country of great Renascence landed gentlefolk who have been unconsciously outgrown and overgrown
The proper shops for Bladesover custom were still to be found in Regent Street and Bond Street in my early London days in those days they had been but lightly touched by the Americans profaning handand in Piccadilly
I found the doctors house of the country village or country town up and down Harley Street multiplied but not otherwise different and the family solicitor by the hundred further eastward in the abandoned houses of a previous generation of gentlepeople and down in Westminster behind Palladian fronts the public offices sheltered in large Bladesoverish rooms and looked out on St Jamess Park
The Parliament Houses of lords and gentlemen the parliament house that was horrified when merchants and brewers came thrusting into it a hundred years ago stood out upon its terrace gathering the whole system together into a head
And the more I have paralleled these things with my BladesoverEastry model the more evident it has become to me that the balance is not the same and the more evident is the presence of great new forces blind forces of invasion of growth
The railway termini on the north side of London have been kept as remote as Eastry had kept the railwaystation from Wimblehurst they stop on the very outskirts of the estates but from the south the South Eastern railway had butted its great stupid rusty iron head of Charing Cross station that great head that came smashing down in 1905clean across the river between Somerset House and Whitehall
The south side had no protecting estate
Factory chimneys smoke right over against Westminster with an air of carelessly not having permission and the whole effect of industrial London and of all London east of Temple Bar and of the huge dingy immensity of London port is to me of something disproportionately large something morbidly expanded without plan or intention dark and sinister toward the clean clear social assurance of the West End
And south of this central London southeast southwest far west northwest all round the northern hills are similar disproportionate growths endless streets of undistinguished houses undistinguished industries shabby families secondrate shops inexplicable people who in a once fashionable phrase do not exist
All these aspects have suggested to my mind at times do suggest to this day the unorganised abundant substance of some tumorous growthprocess a process which indeed bursts all the outlines of the affected carcass and protrudes such masses as ignoble comfortable Croydon as tragic impoverished West Ham
To this day I ask myself will those masses ever become structural will they indeed shape into anything new whatever or is that cancerous image their true and ultimate diagnosis
Moreover together with this hypertrophy there is an immigration of elements that have never understood and never will understand the great tradition wedges of foreign settlement embedded in the heart of this yeasty English expansion
One day I remember wandering eastward out of pure curiosityit must have been in my early student daysand discovering a shabbily bright foreign quarter shops displaying Hebrew placards and weird unfamiliar commodities and a concourse of brighteyed eaglenosed people talking some incomprehensible gibberish between the shops and the barrows
And soon I became quite familiar with the devious
vicious dirtilypleasant eroticism of Soho
I found those crowded streets a vast relief from the dull grey exterior of Brompton where I lodged and lived my daily life
In Soho indeed I got my first inkling of the factor of replacement that is so important in both the English and the American process
Even in the West End in Mayfair and the square about Pall Mall Ewart was presently to remind me the face of the old aristocratic dignity was fairer than its substance here were actors and actresses here money lenders and Jews here bold financial adventurers and I thought of my uncles frayed cuff as he pointed out this house in Park Lane and that
That was so and sos who made a corner in borax and that palace belonged to that hero among modern adventurers Barmentrude who used to be an IDBan illicit diamond buyer that is to say
A city of Bladesovers the capital of a kingdom of Bladesovers all much shaken and many altogether in decay parasitically occupied insidiously replaced by alien unsympathetic and irresponsible elements and with a ruling an adventitious and miscellaneous empire of a quarter of this daedal earth complex laws intricate social necessities disturbing insatiable suggestions followed from this
Such was the world into which I had come into which I had in some way to thrust myself and fit my problem my temptations my efforts my patriotic instinct all my moral instincts my physical appetites my dreams and my sanity
London
I came up to it young and without advisers rather priggish rather dangerously openminded and very openeyed and with somethingit is I think the common gift of imaginative youth and I claim it unblushinglyfine in me finer than the world and seeking fine responses
I did not want simply to live or simply to live happily or well I wanted to serve and do and makewith some nobility
It was in me
It is in half the youth of the world
II I had come to London as a scholar
I had taken the Vincent Bradley scholarship of the Pharmaceutical Society but I threw this up when I found that my work of the Science and Art Department in mathematics physics and chemistry had given me one of the minor Technical Board Scholarships at the Consolidated Technical Schools at South Kensington
This latter was in mechanics and metallurgy and I hesitated between the two
The Vincent Bradley gave me L70 a year and quite the best startoff a pharmaceutical chemist could have the South Kensington thing was worth about twentytwo shillings a week and the prospects it opened were vague
But it meant far more scientific work than the former and I was still under the impulse of that great intellectual appetite that is part of the adolescence of men of my type
Moreover it seemed to lead towards engineering in which I imaginedI imagine to this daymy particular use is to be found
I took its greater uncertainty as a fair risk
I came up very keen not doubting that the really hard and steady industry that had carried me through Wimblehurst would go on still in the new surroundings
Only from the very first it didnt
When I look back now at my Wimblehurst days I still find myself surprised at the amount of steady grinding study of strenuous selfdiscipline that I maintained throughout my apprenticeship
In many ways I think that time was the most honourable period in my life
I wish I could say with a certain mind that my motives in working so well were large and honourable too
To a certain extent they were so there was a fine sincere curiosity a desire for the strength and power of scientific knowledge and a passion for intellectual exercise but I do not think those forces alone would have kept me at it so grimly and closely if Wimblehurst had not been so dull so limited and so observant
Directly I came into the London atmosphere tasting freedom tasting irresponsibility and the pull of new forces altogether my discipline fell from me like a garment
Wimblehurst to a youngster in my position offered no temptations worth counting no interests to conflict with study no vicessuch vices as it offered were coarsely stripped of any imaginative glamourfull drunkenness clumsy leering shameful lust no social intercourse even to waste ones time and on the other hand it would minister greatly to the selfesteem of a conspicuously industrious student
One was marked as clever one played up to the part and ones little accomplishment stood out finely in ones private reckoning against the sunlit small ignorance of that agreeable place
One went with an intent rush across the market square one took ones exercise with as dramatic a sense of an ordered day as an Oxford don one burnt the midnight oil quite consciously at the rare respectful benighted passerby
And one stood out finely in the local paper with ones unapproachable yearly harvest of certificates
Thus I was not only a genuinely keen student but also a little of a prig and poseur in those daysand the latter kept the former at it as London made clear
Moreover Wimblehurst had given me no outlet in any other direction
But I did not realise all this when I came to London did not perceive how the change of atmosphere began at once to warp and distribute my energies
In the first place I became invisible
If I idled for a day no one except my fellowstudents who evidently had no awe for me remarked it
No one saw my midnight taper no one pointed me out as I crossed the street as an astonishing intellectual phenomenon
In the next place I became inconsiderable
In Wimblehurst I felt I stood for Science nobody there seemed to have so much as I and to have it so fully and completely
In London I walked ignorant in an immensity and it was clear that among my fellowstudents from the midlands and the north I was illequipped and undertrained
With the utmost exertion I should only take a secondary position among them
And finally in the third place I was distracted by voluminous new interests London took hold of me and Science which had been the universe shrank back to the dimensions of tiresome little formulae compacted in a book
I came to London in late September and it was a very different London from that great greylyovercast smokestained housewilderness of my first impressions
I reached it by Victoria and not by Cannon Street and its centre was now in Exhibition Road
It shone pale amber bluegrey and tenderly spacious and fine under clear autumnal skies
a London of hugely handsome buildings and vistas and distances a London of gardens and labyrinthine tall museums of old trees and remote palaces and artificial waters
I lodged near by in West Brompton at a house in a little square
So London faced me the second time making me forget altogether for a while the grey drizzling city visage that had first looked upon me
I settled down and went to and fro to my lectures and laboratory in the beginning I worked hard and only slowly did the curiosity that presently possessed me to know more of this huge urban province arise the desire to find something beyond mechanism that I could serve some use other than learning
With this was a growing sense of loneliness a desire for adventure and intercourse
I found myself in the evenings poring over a map of London I had bought instead of copying out lecture notesand on Sundays I made explorations taking omnibus rides east and west and north and south and to enlarging and broadening the sense of great swarming hinterlands of humanity with whom I had no dealings of whom I knew nothing
The whole illimitable place teemed with suggestions of indefinite and sometimes outrageous possibility of hidden but magnificent meanings
It wasnt simply that I received a vast impression of space and multitude and opportunity intimate things also were suddenly dragged from neglected veiled and darkened corners into an acute vividness of perception
Close at hand in the big art museum I came for the first time upon the beauty of nudity which I had hitherto held to be a shameful secret flaunted and gloried in I was made aware of beauty as not only permissible but desirable and frequent and of a thousand hitherto unsuspected rich aspects of life
One night in a real rapture I walked round the upper gallery of the Albert Hall and listened for the first time to great music I believe now that it was a rendering of Beethovens Ninth Symphony My apprehension of spaces and places was reinforced by a quickened apprehension of persons
A constant stream of people passed by me eyes met and challenged mine and passedmore and more I wanted then to stayif I went eastward towards Piccadilly women who seemed then to my boyish inexperience softly splendid and alluring murmured to me as they passed
Extraordinarily life unveiled
The very hoardings clamoured strangely at ones senses and curiosities
One bought pamphlets and papers full of strange and daring ideas transcending ones boldest in the parks one heard men discussing the very existence of God denying the rights of property debating a hundred things that one dared not think about in Wimblehurst
And after the ordinary overcast day after dull mornings came twilight and London lit up and became a thing of white and yellow and red jewels of light and wonderful floods of golden illumination and stupendous and unfathomable shadowsand there were no longer any mean or shabby peoplebut a great mysterious movement of unaccountable beings
Always I was coming on the queerest new aspects
Late one Saturday night I found myself one of a great slowmoving crowd between the blazing shops and the flaring barrows in the Harrow Road I got into conversation with two boldeyed girls bought them boxes of chocolate made the acquaintance of father and mother and various younger brothers and sisters sat in a publichouse hilariously with them all standing and being stood drinks and left them in the small hours at the door of home never to see them again
And once I was accosted on the outskirts of a Salvation Army meeting in one of the parks by a silkhatted young man of eager and serious discourse who argued against scepticism with me invited me home to tea into a clean and cheerful family of brothers and sisters and friends and there I spent the evening singing hymns to the harmonium which reminded me of halfforgotten Chatham and wishing all the sisters were not so obviously engaged Then on the remote hill of this boundless cityworld I found Ewart
III How well I remember the first morning a bright Sunday morning in early October when I raided in upon Ewart
I found my old schoolfellow in bed in a room over an oilshop in a back street at the foot of Highgate Hill
His landlady a pleasant dirty young woman with softbrown eyes brought down his message for me to come up and up I went
The room presented itself as ample and interesting in detail and shabby with a quite commendable shabbiness
I had an impression of brown wallsthey were papered with brown paper of a long shelf along one side of the room with dusty plaster casts and a small cheap lay figure of a horse of a table and something of grey wax partially covered with a cloth and of scattered drawings
There was a gas stove in one corner and some enameled ware that had been used for overnight cooking
The oilcloth on the floor was streaked with a peculiar white dust
Ewart himself was not in the first instance visible but only a fourfold canvas screen at the end of the room from which shouts proceeded of Come on
then his wiry black hair very much rumpled and a staring redbrown eye and his stump of a nose came round the edge of this at a height of about three feet from the ground Its old Ponderevo
he said the Early bird
And hes caught the worm
By Jove but its cold this morning
Come round here and sit on the bed
I walked round wrung his hand and we surveyed one another
He was lying on a small wooden foldup bed the scanty covering of which was supplemented by an overcoat and an elderly but still cheerful pair of check trousers and he was wearing pajamas of a virulent pink and green
His neck seemed longer and more stringy than it had been even in our schooldays and his upper lip had a wiry black moustache
The rest of his ruddy knobby countenance his erratic hair and his general hairy leanness had not evento my perceptions grown
By Jove
he said youve got quite decentlooking Ponderevo
What do you think of me
Youre all right
What are you doing here
Art my sonsculpture
And incidentally He hesitated
I ply a trade
Will you hand me that pipe and those smoking things
So
You cant make coffee eh
Well try your hand
Cast down this screennofold it up and so well go into the other room
Ill keep in bed all the same
The fires a gas stove
Yes
Dont make it bang too loud as you light itI cant stand it this morning
You wont smoke 
Well it does me good to see you again Ponderevo
Tell me what youre doing and how youre getting on
He directed me in the service of his simple hospitality and presently I came back to his bed and sat down and smiled at him there smoking comfortably with his hands under his head surveying me
Hows Lifes Morning Ponderevo
By Jove it must be nearly six years since we met
Theyve got moustaches
Weve fleshed ourselves a bit eh
And you
I felt a pipe was becoming after all and that lit I gave him a favourable sketch of my career
Science
And youve worked like that
While Ive been potting round doing odd jobs for stonemasons and people and trying to get to sculpture
Ive a sort of feeling that the chiselI began with painting Ponderevo and found I was colourblind colourblind enough to stop it
Ive drawn about and thought aboutthought more particularly
I give myself three days a week as an art student and the rest of the time Ive a sort of trade that keeps me
And were still in the beginning of things young men starting
Do you remember the old times at Goudhurst our dollshouse island the Retreat of the Ten Thousand Young Holmes and the rabbits eh
Its surprising if you think of it to find we are still young
And we used to talk of what we would be and we used to talk of love
I suppose you know all about that now Ponderevo
I finished and hesitated on some vague foolish lie No I said a little ashamed of the truth
Do you
Ive been too busy
Im just beginningjust as we were then
Things happen
He sucked at his pipe for a space and stared at the plaster cast of a flayed hand that hung on the wall
The fact is Ponderevo Im beginning to find life a most extraordinary queer setout the things that pull one the things that dont
The wantsThis business of sex
Its a net
No end to it no way out of it no sense in it
There are times when women take possession of me when my mind is like a painted ceiling at Hampton Court with the pride of the flesh sprawling all over it
WHY
And then again sometimes when I have to encounter a woman I am overwhelmed by a terror of tantalising boredomI fly I hide I do anything
Youve got your scientific explanations perhaps whats Nature and the universe up to in that matter
Its her way I gather of securing the continuity of the species
But it doesnt said Ewart
Thats just it
No
I have succumbed todissipationdown the hill there
Euston Road way
And it was damned ugly and mean and I hate having done it
And the continuity of the speciesLord
And why does Nature make a man so infernally ready for drinks
Theres no sense in that anyhow
He sat up in bed to put this question with the greater earnestness
And why has she given me a most violent desire towards sculpture and an equally violent desire to leave off work directly I begin it eh
Lets have some more coffee
I put it to you these things puzzle me Ponderevo
They dishearten me
They keep me in bed
He had an air of having saved up these difficulties for me for some time
He sat with his chin almost touching his knees sucking at his pipe
Thats what I mean he went on when I say life is getting on to me as extraordinarily queer I dont see my game nor why I was invited
And I dont make anything of the world outside either
What do you make of it
London I began
Itsso enormous
Isnt it
And its all up to nothing
You find chaps keeping grocers shopswhy the DEVIL Ponderevo do they keep grocers shops
They all do it very carefully very steadily very meanly
You find people running about and doing the most remarkable things being policemen for example and burglars
They go about these businesses quite gravely and earnestly
I somehowcant go about mine
Is there any sense in it at allanywhere
There must be sense in it I said
Were young
Were youngyes
But one must inquire
The grocers a grocer because I suppose he sees he comes in there
Feels that on the whole it amounts to a call
But the bother is I dont see where I come in at all
Do you
Where you come in
No where you come in
Not exactly yet I said
I want to do some good in the worldsomethingsomething effectual before I die
I have a sort of idea my scientific work I dont know
Yes he mused
And Ive got a sort of idea my sculpturebut now it is to come in and WHYIve no idea at all
He hugged his knees for a space
Thats what puzzles me Ponderevo no end
He became animated
If you will look in that cupboard he said you will find an old respectable looking roll on a plate and a knife somewhere and a gallipot containing butter
You give them me and Ill make my breakfast and then if you dont mind watching me paddle about at my simple toilet Ill get up
Then well go for a walk and talk about this affair of life further
And about Art and Literature and anything else that crops up on the way
Yes thats the gallipot
Cockroach got in it
Chuck him outdamned interloper So in the first five minutes of our talk as I seem to remember it now old Ewart struck the note that ran through all that mornings intercourse To me it was a most memorable talk because it opened out quite new horizons of thought
Id been working rather close and out of touch with Ewarts free gesticulating way
He was pessimistic that day and sceptical to the very root of things
He made me feel clearly what I had not felt at all before the general adventurousness of life particularly of life at the stage we had reached and also the absence of definite objects of any concerted purpose in the lives that were going on all round us
He made me feel too how ready I was to take up commonplace assumptions
Just as I had always imagined that somewhere in social arrangements there was certainly a HeadMaster who would intervene if one went too far so I had always had a sort of implicit belief that in our England there were somewhere people who understood what we were all as a nation about
That crumpled into his pit of doubt and vanished
He brought out sharply cut and certain the immense effect of purposelessness in London that I was already indistinctly feeling
We found ourselves at last returning through Highgate Cemetery and Waterlow Parkand Ewart was talking
Look at it there he said stopping and pointing to the great vale of London spreading wide and far
Its like a seaand we swim in it
And at last down we go and then up we comewashed up here
He swung his arms to the long slopes about us tombs and headstones in long perspectives in limitless rows
Were young Ponderevo but sooner or later our whitened memories will wash up on one of these beaches on some such beach as this
George Ponderevo FRS Sidney Ewart RIP
Look at the rows of em
He paused
Do you see that hand
The hand I mean pointing upward on the top of a blunted obelisk
Yes
Well thats what I do for a livingwhen Im not thinking or drinking or prowling or making love or pretending Im trying to be a sculptor without either the money or the morals for a model
See
And I do those hearts afire and those pensive angel guardians with the palm of peace
Damned well I do em and damned cheap
Im a sweated victim Ponderevo That was the way of it anyhow
I drank deep of talk that day we went into theology into philosophy I had my first glimpse of socialism
I felt as though I had been silent in a silence since I and he had parted
At the thought of socialism Ewarts moods changed for a time to a sort of energy
After all all this confounded vagueness might be altered
If you could get men to work together It was a good talk that rambled through all the universe
I thought I was giving my mind refreshment but indeed it was dissipation
All sorts of ideas even now carry me back as it were to a fountainhead to Waterlow Park and my resuscitated Ewart
There stretches away south of us long garden slopes and white gravestones and the wide expanse of London and somewhere in the picture is a red old wall sunwarmed and a great blaze of Michaelmas daisies set off with late golden sunflowers and a drift of mottled bloodred fallen leaves
It was with me that day as though I had lifted my head suddenly out of dull and immediate things and looked at life altogether
But it played the very devil with the copying up of my arrears of notes to which I had vowed the latter half of that day
After that reunion Ewart and I met much and talked much and in our subsequent encounters his monologue was interrupted and I took my share
He had exercised me so greatly that I lay awake at nights thinking him over and discoursed and answered him in my head as I went in the morning to the College
I am by nature a doer and only by the way a critic his philosophical assertion of the incalculable vagueness of life which fitted his natural indolence roused my more irritable and energetic nature to active protests
Its all so pointless I said because people are slack and because its in the ebb of an age
But youre a socialist
Well lets bring that about
And theres a purpose
There you are
Ewart gave me all my first conceptions of socialism in a little while I was an enthusiastic socialist and he was a passive resister to the practical exposition of the theories he had taught me
We must join some organisation I said
We ought to do things We ought to go and speak at street corners
People dont know
You must figure me a rather illdressed young man in a state of great earnestness standing up in that shabby studio of his and saying these things perhaps with some gesticulations and Ewart with a claysmudged face dressed perhaps in a flannel shirt and trousers with a pipe in his mouth squatting philosophically at a table working at some chunk of clay that never got beyond suggestion
I wonder why one doesnt want to he said
It was only very slowly I came to gauge Ewarts real position in the scheme of things to understand how deliberate and complete was this detachment of his from the moral condemnation and responsibilities that played so fine a part in his talk
His was essentially the nature of an artistic appreciator he could find interest and beauty in endless aspects of things that I marked as evil or at least as not negotiable and the impulse I had towards selfdeception to sustained and consistent selfdevotion disturbed and detached and pointless as it was at that time he had indeed a sort of admiration for but no sympathy
Like many fantastic and ample talkers he was at bottom secretive and he gave me a series of little shocks of discovery throughout our intercourse
The first of these came in the realisation that he quite seriously meant to do nothing in the world at all towards reforming the evils he laid bare in so easy and dexterous a manner
The next came in the sudden appearance of a person called MillyIve forgotten her surnamewhom I found in his room one evening simply attired in a blue wrapthe rest of her costume behind the screensmoking cigarettes and sharing a flagon of an amazingly cheap and selfassertive grocers wine Ewart affected called Canary Sack
Hullo
said Ewart as I came in
This is Milly you know
Shes been being a modelshe IS a model really keep calm Ponderevo
Have some sack
Milly was a woman of thirty perhaps with a broad rather pretty face a placid disposition a bad accent and delightful blond hair that waved off her head with an irrepressible variety of charm and whenever Ewart spoke she beamed at him
Ewart was always sketching this hair of hers and embarking upon clay statuettes of her that were never finished
She was I know now a woman of the streets whom Ewart had picked up in the most casual manner and who had fallen in love with him but my inexperience in those days was too great for me to place her then and Ewart offered no elucidations
She came to him he went to her they took holidays together in the country when certainly she sustained her fair share of their expenditure
I suspect him now even of taking money from her
Odd old Ewart
It was a relationship so alien to my orderly conceptions of honour to what I could imagine any friend of mine doing that I really hardly saw it with it there under my nose
But I see it and I think I understand it now Before I fully grasped the discursive manner in which Ewart was committed to his particular way in life I did I say as the broad constructive ideas of socialism took hold of me try to get him to work with me in some definite fashion as a socialist
We ought to join on to other socialists I said
Theyve got something
Lets go and look at some first
After some pains we discovered the office of the Fabian Society lurking in a cellar in Clements Inn and we went and interviewed a rather discouraging secretary who stood astraddle in front of a fire and questioned us severely and seemed to doubt the integrity of our intentions profoundly
He advised us to attend the next open meeting in Cliffords Inn and gave us the necessary data
We both contrived to get to the affair and heard a discursive gritty paper on Trusts and one of the most inconclusive discussions you can imagine
Threequarters of the speakers seemed under some jocular obsession which took the form of pretending to be conceited
It was a sort of family joke and as strangers to the family we did not like it As we came out through the narrow passage from Cliffords Inn to the Strand Ewart suddenly pitched upon a wizened spectacled little man in a vast felt hat and a large orange tie
How many members are there in this Fabian Society of yours
he asked
The little man became at once defensive in his manner
About seven hundred he said perhaps eight
Likelike the ones here
The little man gave a nervous selfsatisfied laugh
I suppose theyre up to sample he said
The little man dropped out of existence and we emerged upon the Strand
Ewart twisted his arm into a queerly eloquent gesture that gathered up all the tall facades of the banks the business places the projecting clock and towers of the Law Courts the advertisements the luminous signs into one social immensity into a capitalistic system gigantic and invincible
These socialists have no sense of proportion he said
What can you expect of them
IV Ewart as the embodiment of talk was certainly a leading factor in my conspicuous failure to go on studying
Social theory in its first crude form of Democratic Socialism gripped my intelligence more and more powerfully
I argued in the laboratory with the man who shared my bench until we quarreled and did not speak and also I fell in love
The ferment of sex had been creeping into my being like a slowly advancing tide through all my Wimblehurst days the stimulus of London was like the rising of a wind out of the sea that brings the waves in fast and high
Ewart had his share in that
More and more acutely and unmistakably did my perception of beauty form and sound my desire for adventure my desire for intercourse converge on this central and commanding business of the individual life
I had to get me a mate
I began to fall in love faintly with girls I passed in the street with women who sat before me in trains with girl fellowstudents with ladies in passing carriages with loiterers at the corners with neathanded waitresses in shops and tearooms with pictures even of girls and women
On my rare visits to the theatre I always became exalted and found the actresses and even the spectators about me mysterious attractive creatures of deep interest and desire
I had a stronger and stronger sense that among these glancing passing multitudes there was somewhere one who was for me
And in spite of every antagonistic force in the world there was something in my very marrow that insisted Stop
Look at this one
Think of her
Wont she do 
This signifiesthis before all things signifies
Stop
Why are you hurrying by
This may be the predestined personbefore all others
It is odd that I cant remember when first I saw Marion who became my wifewhom I was to make wretched who was to make me wretched who was to pluck that fine generalised possibility of love out of my early manhood and make it a personal conflict
I became aware of her as one of a number of interesting attractive figures that moved about in my world that glanced back at my eyes that flitted by with a kind of averted watchfulness
I would meet her coming through the Art Museum which was my short cut to the Brompton Road or see her sitting reading as I thought in one of the bays of the Education Library
But really as I found out afterwards she never read
She used to come there to eat a bun in quiet
She was a very gracefullymoving figure of a girl then very plainly dressed with dark brown hair I remember in a knot low on her neck behind that confessed the pretty roundness of her head and harmonised with the admirable lines of ears and cheek the grave serenity of mouth and brow
She stood out among the other girls very distinctly because they dressed more than she did struck emphatic notes of colour startled one by novelties in hats and bows and things
Ive always hated the rustle the disconcerting colour boundaries the smart unnatural angles of womens clothes
Her plain black dress gave her a starkness
I do remember though how one afternoon I discovered the peculiar appeal of her form for me
I had been restless with my work and had finally slipped out of the Laboratory and come over to the Art Museum to lounge among the pictures
I came upon her in an odd corner of the Sheepshanks gallery intently copying something from a picture that hung high
I had just been in the gallery of casts from the antique my mind was all alive with my newly awakened sense of line and there she stood with face upturned her body drooping forward from the hips just a littlememorably gracefulfeminine
After that I know I sought to see her felt a distinctive emotion at her presence began to imagine things about her
I no longer thought of generalised womanhood or of this casual person or that
I thought of her
An accident brought us together
I found myself one Monday morning in an omnibus staggering westward from VictoriaI was returning from a Sunday Id spent at Wimblehurst in response to a unique freak of hospitality on the part of Mr Mantell
She was the sole other inside passenger
And when the time came to pay her fare she became an extremely scared disconcerted and fumbling young woman she had left her purse at home
Luckily I had some money
She looked at me with startled troubled brown eyes she permitted my proffered payment to the conductor with a certain ungraciousness that seemed a part of her shyness and then as she rose to go she thanked me with an obvious affectation of ease
Thank you so much she said in a pleasant soft voice and then less gracefully Awfully kind of you you know
I fancy I made polite noises
But just then I wasnt disposed to be critical
I was full of the sense of her presence her arm was stretched out over me as she moved past me the gracious slenderness of her body was near me
The words we used didnt seem very greatly to matter
I had vague ideas of getting out with herand I didnt
That encounter I have no doubt exercised me enormously
I lay awake at night rehearsing it and wondering about the next phase of our relationship
That took the form of the return of my twopence
I was in the Science Library digging something out of the Encyclopedia Britannica when she appeared beside me and placed on the open page an evidently premeditated thin envelope bulgingly confessing the coins within
It was so very kind of you she said the other day
I dont know what I should have done Mr I supplied my name
I knew I said you were a student here
Not exactly a student
I Well anyhow I knew you were here frequently
And Im a student myself at the Consolidated Technical Schools
I plunged into autobiography and questionings and so entangled her in a conversation that got a quality of intimacy through the fact that out of deference to our fellowreaders we were obliged to speak in undertones
And I have no doubt that in substance it was singularly banal
Indeed I have an impression that all our early conversations were incredibly banal
We met several times in a manner halfaccidental half furtive and wholly awkward
Mentally I didnt take hold of her
I never did take hold of her mentally
Her talk I now know all too clearly was shallow pretentious evasive
Onlyeven to this dayI dont remember it as in any way vulgar
She was I could see quite clearly anxious to overstate or conceal her real social status a little desirous to be taken for a student in the art school and a little ashamed that she wasnt
She came to the museum to copy things and this I gathered had something to do with some way of partially earning her living that I wasnt to inquire into
I told her things about myself vain things that I felt might appeal to her but that I learnt long afterwards made her think me conceited
We talked of books but there she was very much on her guard and secretive and rather more freely of pictures
She liked pictures
I think from the outset I appreciated and did not for a moment resent that hers was a commonplace mind that she was the unconscious custodian of something that had gripped my most intimate instinct that she embodied the hope of a possibility was the careless proprietor of a physical quality that had turned my head like strong wine
I felt I had to stick to our acquaintance flat as it was
Presently we should get through these irrelevant exterior things and come to the reality of love beneath
I saw her in dreams released as it were from herself beautiful worshipful glowing
And sometimes when we were together we would come on silences through sheer lack of matter and then my eyes would feast on her and the silence seemed like the drawing back of a curtainher superficial self
Odd I confess
Odd particularly the enormous hold of certain things about her upon me a certain slight rounded duskiness of skin a certain perfection of modelling in her lips her brow a certain fine flow about the shoulders
She wasnt indeed beautiful to many peoplethese things are beyond explaining
She had manifest defects of form and feature and they didnt matter at all
Her complexion was bad but I dont think it would have mattered if it had been positively unwholesome
I had extraordinarily limited extraordinarily painful desires
I longed intolerably to kiss her lips
V The affair was immensely serious and commanding to me
I dont remember that in these earlier phases I had any thought of turning back at all
It was clear to me that she regarded me with an eye entirely more critical than I had for her that she didnt like my scholarly untidiness my want of even the most commonplace style
Why do you wear collars like that
she said and sent me in pursuit of gentlemanly neckwear
I remember when she invited me a little abruptly one day to come to tea at her home on the following Sunday and meet her father and mother and aunt that I immediately doubted whether my hitherto unsuspected best clothes would create the impression she desired me to make on her belongings
I put off the encounter until the Sunday after to get myself in order
I had a morning coat made and I bought a silk hat and had my reward in the first glance of admiration she ever gave me
I wonder how many of my sex are as preposterous
I was you see abandoning all my beliefs my conventions unasked
I was forgetting myself immensely
And there was a conscious shame in it all
Never a worddid I breathe to Ewartto any living soul of what was going on
Her father and mother and aunt struck me as the dismalest of people and her home in Walham Green was chiefly notable for its black and amber tapestry carpets and curtains and tablecloths and the age and irrelevance of its books mostly books with faded gilt on the covers
The windows were fortified against the intrusive eye by cheap lace curtains and an art pot upon an unstable octagonal table
Several framed Art School drawings of Marions bearing official South Kensington marks of approval adorned the room and there was a black and gilt piano with a hymnbook on the top of it
There were draped mirrors over all the mantels and above the sideboard in the diningroom in which we sat at tea was a portrait of her father villainously truthful after the manner of such works
I couldnt see a trace of the beauty I found in her in either parent yet she somehow contrived to be like them both
These people pretended in a way that reminded me of the Three Great Women in my mothers room but they had not nearly so much social knowledge and did not do it nearly so well
Also I remarked they did it with an eye on Marion
They had wanted to thank me they said for the kindness to their daughter in the matter of the bus fare and so accounted for anything unusual in their invitation
They posed as simple gentlefolk a little hostile to the rush and gaddingabout of London preferring a secluded and unpretentious quiet
When Marion got out the white tablecloth from the sideboarddrawer for tea a card bearing the word APARTMENTS fell to the floor
I picked it up and gave it to her before I realised from her quickened colour that I should not have seen it that probably had been removed from the window in honour of my coming
Her father spoke once in a large remote way of he claims of business engagements and it was only long afterwards I realised that he was a supernumerary clerk in the Walham Green Gas Works and otherwise a useful man at home
He was a large loose fattish man with unintelligent brown eyes magnified by spectacles he wore an illfitting frockcoat and a paper collar and he showed me as his great treasure and interest a large Bible which he had grangerised with photographs of pictures
Also he cultivated the little gardenyard behind the house and he had a small greenhouse with tomatoes
I wish I ad eat he said
One can do such a lot with eat
But I suppose you cant ave everything you want in this world
Both he and Marions mother treated her with a deference that struck me as the most natural thing in the world
Her own manner changed became more authoritative and watchful her shyness disappeared
She had taken a line of her own I gathered draped the mirror got the secondhand piano and broken her parents in
Her mother must once have been a pretty woman she had regular features and Marions hair without its lustre but she was thin and careworn
The aunt Miss Ramboat was a large abnormally shy person very like her brother and I dont recall anything she said on this occasion
To begin with there was a good deal of tension Marion was frightfully nervous and every one was under the necessity of behaving in a mysteriously unreal fashion until I plunged became talkative and made a certain ease and interest
I told them of the schools of my lodgings of Wimblehurst and my apprenticeship days
Theres a lot of this Science about nowadays Mr Ramboat reflected but I sometimes wonder a bit what good it is
I was young enough to be led into what he called a bit of a discussion which Marion truncated before our voices became unduly raised
I dare say she said theres much to be said on both sides
I remember Marions mother asked me what church I attended and that I replied evasively
After tea there was music and we sang hymns
I doubted if I had a voice when this was proposed but that was held to be a trivial objection and I found sitting close beside the sweep of hair from Marions brow had many compensations
I discovered her mother sitting in the horsehair armchair and regarding us sentimentally
I went for a walk with Marion towards Putney Bridge and then there was more singing and a supper of cold bacon and pie after which Mr Ramboat and I smoked
During that walk I remember she told me the import of her sketchings and copyings in the museum
A cousin of a friend of hers whom she spoke of as Smithie had developed an original business in a sort of teagown garment which she called a Persian Robe a plain sort of wrap with a gaily embroidered yoke and Marion went there and worked in the busy times
In the times that werent busy she designed novelties in yokes by an assiduous use of eyes and notebook in the museum and went home and traced out the captured forms on the foundation material
I dont get much said Marion but its interesting and in the busy times we work all day
Of course the workgirls are dreadfully common but we dont say much to them
And Smithie talks enough for ten
I quite understood the workgirls were dreadfully common
I dont remember that the Walham Green menage and the quality of these people nor the light they threw on Marion detracted in the slightest degree at that time from the intent resolve that held me to make her mine
I didnt like them
But I took them as part of the affair
Indeed on the whole I think they threw her up by an effect of contrast she was so obviously controlling them so consciously superior to them
More and more of my time did I give to this passion that possessed me
I began to think chiefly of ways of pleasing Marion of acts of devotion of treats of sumptuous presents for her of appeals she would understand
If at times she was manifestly unintelligent in her ignorance became indisputable I told myself her simple instincts were worth all the education and intelligence in the world
And to this day I think I wasnt really wrong about her
There was something extraordinarily fine about her something simple and high that flickered in and out of her ignorance and commonness and limitations like the tongue from the mouth of a snake One night I was privileged to meet her and bring her home from an entertainment at the Birkbeck Institute
We came back on the underground railway and we travelled firstclassthat being the highest class available
We were alone in the carriage and for the first time I ventured to put my arm about her
You mustnt she said feebly
I love you I whispered suddenly with my heart beating wildly drew her to me drew all her beauty to me and kissed her cool and unresisting lips
Love me
she said struggling away from me Dont
and then as the train ran into a station You must tell no one
I dont know You shouldnt have done that Then two other people got in with us and terminated my wooing for a time
When we found ourselves alone together walking towards Battersea she had decided to be offended
I parted from her unforgiven and terribly distressed
When we met again she told me I must never say that again
I had dreamt that to kiss her lips was ultimate satisfaction
But it was indeed only the beginning of desires
I told her my one ambition was to marry her
But she said youre not in a position Whats the good of talking like that
I stared at her
I mean to I said
You cant she answered
It will be years But I love you I insisted
I stood not a yard from the sweet lips I had kissed I stood within arms length of the inanimate beauty I desired to quicken and I saw opening between us a gulf of years toil waiting disappointments and an immense uncertainty
I love you I said
Dont you love me
She looked me in the face with grave irresponsive eyes
I dont know she said
I LIKE you of course One has to be sensibl I can remember now my sense of frustration by her unresilient reply
I should have perceived then that for her my ardour had no quickening fire
But how was I to know
I had let myself come to want her my imagination endowed her with infinite possibilities
I wanted her and wanted her stupidly and instinctively But I said Love
One has to be sensible she replied
I like going about with you
Cant we keep as we are
VI Well you begin to understand my breakdown now I have been copious enough with these apologia
My work got more and more spiritless my behaviour degenerated my punctuality declined I was more and more outclassed in the steady grind by my fellowstudents
Such supplies of moral energy as I still had at command shaped now in the direction of serving Marion rather than science
I fell away dreadfully more and more I shirked and skulked the humped men from the north the pale men with thin clenched minds the intent hardbreathing students I found against me fell at last from keen rivalry to moral contempt
Even a girl got above me upon one of the lists
Then indeed I made it a point of honour to show by my public disregard of every rule that I really did not even pretend to try
So one day I found myself sitting in a mood of considerable astonishment in Kensington Gardens reacting on a recent heated interview with the school Registrar in which I had displayed more spirit than sense
I was astonished chiefly at my stupendous falling away from all the militant ideals of unflinching study I had brought up from Wimblehurst
I had displayed myself as the Registrar put it an unmitigated rotter
My failure to get marks in the written examination had only been equalled by the insufficiency of my practical work
I ask you the Registrar had said what will become of you when your scholarship runs out
It certainly was an interesting question
What was going to become of me
It was clear there would be nothing for me in the schools as I had once dared to hope there seemed indeed scarcely anything in the world except an illpaid assistantship in some provincial organized Science School or grammar school
I knew that for that sort of work without a degree or any qualification one earned hardly a bare living and had little leisure to struggle up to anything better
If only I had even as little as fifty pounds I might hold out in London and take my BSc
degree and quadruple my chances
My bitterness against my uncle returned at the thought
After all he had some of my money still or ought to have
Why shouldnt I act within my rights threaten to take proceedings
I meditated for a space on the idea and then returned to the Science Library and wrote him a very considerable and occasionally pungent letter
That letter to my uncle was the nadir of my failure
Its remarkable consequences which ended my student days altogether I will tell in the next chapter
I say my failure
Yet there are times when I can even doubt whether that period was a failure at all when I become defensively critical of those exacting courses I did not follow the encyclopaedic process of scientific exhaustion from which I was distracted
My mind was not inactive even if it fed on forbidden food
I did not learn what my professors and demonstrators had resolved I should learn but I learnt many things
My mind learnt to swing wide and to swing by itself
After all those other fellows who took high places in the College examinations and were the professors model boys havent done so amazingly
Some are professors themselves some technical experts not one can show things done such as I following my own interest have achieved
For I have built boats that smack across the water like whiplashes no one ever dreamt of such boats until I built them and I have surprised three secrets that are more than technical discoveries in the unexpected hidingplaces of Nature
I have come nearer flying than any man has done
Could I have done as much if I had had a turn for obeying those rather mediocre professors at the college who proposed to train my mind
If I had been trained in researchthat ridiculous contradiction in termsshould I have done more than produce additions to the existing store of little papers with blunted conclusions of which there are already too many
I see no sense in mock modesty upon this matter
Even by the standards of worldly success I am by the side of my fellowstudents no failure
I had my FRS
by the time I was thirtyseven and if I am not very wealthy poverty is as far from me as the Spanish Inquisition
Suppose I had stamped down on the head of my wandering curiosity locked my imagination in a box just when it wanted to grow out to things worked by soandsos excellent method and soandsos indications where should I be now
I may be all wrong in this
It may be I should be a far more efficient man than I am if I had cut off all those divergent expenditures of energy plugged up my curiosity about society with more currently acceptable rubbish or other abandoned Ewart evaded Marion instead of pursuing her concentrated
But I dont believe it
However I certainly believed it completely and was filled with remorse on that afternoon when I sat dejectedly in Kensington Gardens and reviewed in the light of the Registrars pertinent questions my first two years in London
CHAPTER THE SECOND THE DAWN COMES AND MY UNCLE APPEARS IN A NEW SILK HAT I Throughout my student days I had not seen my uncle
I refrained from going to him in spite of an occasional regret that in this way I estranged myself from my aunt Susan and I maintained a sulky attitude of mind towards him
And I dont think that once in all that time I gave a thought to that mystic word of his that was to alter all the world for us
Yet I had not altogether forgotten it
It was with a touch of memory dim transient perplexity if no morewhy did this thing seem in some way personalthat I read a new inscription upon the hoardings THE SECRET OF VIGOUR TONOBUNGAY
That was all
It was simple and yet in some way arresting
I found myself repeating the word after I had passed it roused ones attention like the sound of distant guns
Tonowhats that
and deep rich unhurryingBUNgay
Then came my uncles amazing telegram his answer to my hostile note Come to me at once you are wanted three hundred a year certain tonobungay
By Jove
I cried of course
Its something
A patentmedicine
I wonder what he wants with me
In his Napoleonic way my uncle had omitted to give an address
His telegram had been handed in at Farringdon Road and after complex meditations I replied to Ponderevo Farringdon Road trusting to the rarity of our surname to reach him
Where are you
I asked
His reply came promptly 192A Raggett Street EC
The next day I took an unsanctioned holiday after the mornings lecture
I discovered my uncle in a wonderfully new silk hatoh a splendid hat
with a rolling brim that went beyond the common fashion
It was decidedly too big for himthat was its only fault
It was stuck on the back of his head and he was in a white waistcoat and shirt sleeves
He welcomed me with a forgetfulness of my bitter satire and my hostile abstinence that was almost divine
His glasses fell off at the sight of me
His round inexpressive eyes shone brightly
He held out his plump short hand
Here we are George
What did I tell you
Neednt whisper it now my boy
Shout itLOUD
spread it about
Tell every one
TonoTONO TONOBUNGAY
Raggett Street you must understand was a thoroughfare over which some one had distributed large quantities of cabbage stumps and leaves
It opened out of the upper end of Farringdon Street and 192A was a shop with the plateglass front coloured chocolate on which several of the same bills I had read upon the hoardings had been stuck
The floor was covered by street mud that had been brought in on dirty boots and three energetic young men of the hooligan type in neckwraps and caps were packing wooden cases with paperedup bottles amidst much straw and confusion
The counter was littered with these same swathed bottles of a pattern then novel but now amazingly familiar in the world the blue paper with the coruscating figure of a genially nude giant and the printed directions of how under practically all circumstances to take TonoBungay
Beyond the counter on one side opened a staircase down which I seem to remember a girl descending with a further consignment of bottles and the rest of the background was a high partition also chocolate with Temporary Laboratory inscribed upon it in white letters and over a door that pierced it Office
Here I rapped inaudible amid much hammering and then entered unanswered to find my uncle dressed as I have described one hand gripping a sheath of letters and the other scratching his head as he dictated to one of three toiling typewriter girls
Behind him was a further partition and a door inscribed ABSOLUTELY PRIVATENO ADMISSION thereon
This partition was of wood painted the universal chocolate up to about eight feet from the ground and then of glass
Through the glass I saw dimly a crowded suggestion of crucibles and glass retorts andby Joveyesthe dear old Wimblehurst airpump still
It gave me quite a little thrillthat airpump
And beside it was the electrical machinebut somethingsome serious troublehad happened to that
All these were evidently placed on a shelf just at the level to show
Come right into the sanctum said my uncle after he had finished something about esteemed consideration and whisked me through the door into a room that quite amazingly failed to verify the promise of that apparatus
It was papered with dingy wallpaper that had peeled in places it contained a fireplace an easychair with a cushion a table on which stood two or three big bottles a number of cigarboxes on the mantel whisky Tantalus and a row of soda syphons
He shut the door after me carefully
Well here we are
he said
Going strong
Have a whisky George
NoWise man
Neither will I
You see me at it
At ithard
Hard at what
Read it and he thrust into my hand a labelthat label that has now become one of the most familiar objects of the chemists shop the greenishblue rather oldfashioned bordering the legend the name in good black type very clear and the strong man all set about with lightning flashes above the double column of skilful lies in redthe label of TonoBungay
Its afloat he said as I stood puzzling at this
Its afloat
Im afloat
And suddenly he burst out singing in that throaty tenor of his Im afloat Im afloat on the fierce flowing tide The oceans my home and my bark is my bride
Ripping song that is George
Not so much a bark as a solution but stillit does
Here we are at it
Bytheby
Half a mo
Ive thought of a thing
He whisked out leaving me to examine this nuclear spot at leisure while his voice became dictatorial without
The den struck me as in its large grey dirty way quite unprecedented and extraordinary
The bottles were all labelled simply A B C and so forth and that dear old apparatus above seen from this side was even more patiently on the shelf than when it had been used to impress Wimblehurst
I saw nothing for it but to sit down in the chair and await my uncles explanations
I remarked a frockcoat with satin lapels behind the door there was a dignified umbrella in the corner and a clothesbrush and a hatbrush stood on a sidetable
My uncle returned in five minutes looking at his watcha gold watch Gettin lunchtime George he said
Youd better come and have lunch with me
Hows Aunt Susan
I asked
Exuberant
Never saw her so larky
This has bucked her up something wonderfulall this
All what
TonoBungay
What is TonoBungay
I asked
My uncle hesitated
Tell you after lunch George he said
Come along
and having locked up the sanctum after himself led the way along a narrow dirty pavement lined with barrows and swept at times by avalanchelike porters bearing burthens to vans to Farringdon Street
He hailed a passing cab superbly and the cabman was infinitely respectful
Schafers he said and off we went side by sideand with me more and more amazed at all these thingsto Schafers Hotel the second of the two big places with huge lace curtaincovered windows near the corner of Blackfriars Bridge
I will confess I felt a magic charm in our relative proportions as the two colossal paleblueandred liveried porters of Schafers held open the inner doors for us with a respectful salutation that in some manner they seemed to confine wholly to my uncle
Instead of being about four inches taller I felt at least the same size as he and very much slenderer
Still more respectfulwaiters relieved him of the new hat and the dignified umbrella and took his orders for our lunch
He gave them with a fine assurance
He nodded to several of the waiters
They know me George already he said
Point me out
Live place
Eye for coming men
The detailed business of the lunch engaged our attention for a while and then I leant across my plate
And NOW
said I
Its the secret of vigour
Didnt you read that label
Yes but Its selling like hot cakes
And what is it
I pressed
Well said my uncle and then leant forward and spoke softly under cover of his hand Its nothing more or less than But here an unfortunate scruple intervenes
After all TonoBungay is still a marketable commodity and in the hands of purchasers who bought it fromamong other vendorsme
No
I am afraid I cannot give it away You see said my uncle in a slow confidential whisper with eyes very wide and a creased forehead its nice because of the here he mentioned a flavouring matter and an aromatic spirit its stimulating because of here he mentioned two very vivid tonics one with a marked action on the kidney
And the here he mentioned two other ingredients makes it pretty intoxicating
Cocks their tails
Then theres but I touch on the essential secret
And there you are
I got it out of an old book of recipesall except the here he mentioned the more virulent substance the one that assails the kidneys which is my idea
Modern touch
There you are
He reverted to the direction of our lunch
Presently he was leading the way to the loungesumptuous piece in red morocco and yellow glazed crockery with incredible vistas of settees and sofas and things and there I found myself grouped with him in two excessively upholstered chairs with an earthenware Moorish table between us bearing coffee and Benedictine and I was tasting the delights of a tenpenny cigar
My uncle smoked a similar cigar in an habituated manner and he looked energetic and knowing and luxurious and most unexpectedly a little bounder round the end of it
It was just a trivial flaw upon our swagger perhaps that we both were clear our cigars had to be mild
He got obliquely across the spaces of his great armchair so as to incline confidentially to my ear he curled up his little legs and I in my longer way adopted a corresponding receptive obliquity
I felt that we should strike an unbiased observer as a couple of very deep and wily and developing and repulsive persons
I want to let you into thispuffGeorge said my uncle round the end of his cigar
For many reasons
His voice grew lower and more cunning
He made explanations that to my inexperience did not completely explain
I retain an impression of a long credit and a share with a firm of wholesale chemists of a credit and a prospective share with some pirate printers of a third share for a leading magazine and newspaper proprietor
I played em off one against the other said my uncle
I took his point in an instant
He had gone to each of them in turn and said the others had come in
I put up four hundred pounds said my uncle myself and my all
And you know He assumed a brisk confidence
I hadnt five hundred pence
At least For a moment he really was just a little embarrassed
I DID he said produce capital
You see there was that trust affair of yoursI ought I supposein strict legalityto have put that straight first
Zzzz It was a bold thing to do said my uncle shifting the venue from the region of honour to the region of courage
And then with a characteristic outburst of piety Thank God its all come right
And now I suppose you ask where do YOU come in
Well fact is Ive always believed in you George
Youve gotits a sort of dismal grit
Bark your shins rouse you and youll go
Youd rush any position you had a mind to rush
I know a bit about character Georgetrust me
Youve got He clenched his hands and thrust them out suddenly and at the same time said with explosive violence Wooosh
Yes
You have
The way you put away that Latin at Wimblehurst Ive never forgotten it
Woooooosh
Your science and all that
Woooooosh
I know my limitations
Theres things I can do and he spoke in a whisper as though this was the first hint of his lifes secret theres things I cant
Well I can create this business but I cant make it go
Im too voluminousIm a boilerover not a simmering stickatit
You keep on HOTTING UP AND HOTTING UP
Papins digester
Thats you steady and long and piling upthen woooooooosh
Come in and stiffen these niggers
Teach them that woooooooosh
There you are
Thats what Im after
You
Nobody else believes youre more than a boy
Come right in with me and be a man
Eh George
Think of the fun of ita thing on the goa Real Live Thing
Wooshing it up
Making it buzz and spin
Whoooooo
He made alluring expanding circles in the air with his hand
Eh
His proposal sinking to confidential undertones again took more definite shape
I was to give all my time and energy to developing and organising
You shant write a single advertisement or give a single assurance he declared
I can do all that
And the telegram vas no flourish I was to have three hundred a year
Three hundred a year
Thats nothing said my uncle the thing to freeze on to when the time comes is your tenth of the vendors share
Three hundred a year certain anyhow
It was an enormous income to me
For a moment I was altogether staggered
Could there be that much money in the whole concern
I looked about me at the sumptuous furniture of Schafers Hotel
No doubt there were many such incomes
My head was spinning with unwonted Benedictine and Burgundy
Let me go back and look at the game again I said
Let me see upstairs and round about
I did
What do you think of it all
my uncle asked at last
Well for one thing I said why dont you have those girls working in a decently ventilated room
Apart from any other consideration theyd work twice as briskly
And they ought to cover the corks before labelling round the bottle Why
said my uncle
Becausethey sometimes make a mucker of the cork job and then the labels wasted
Come and change it George said my uncle with sudden fervour Come here and make a machine of it
You can
Make it all slick and then make it woosh
I know you can
Oh
I know you can
II I seem to remember very quick changes of mind after that lunch
The muzzy exaltation of the unaccustomed stimulants gave way very rapidly to a model of pellucid and impartial clairvoyance which is one of my habitual mental states
It is intermittent it leaves me for weeks together I know but back it comes at last like justice on circuit and calls up all my impression all my illusions all my willful and passionate proceedings
We came downstairs again into that inner room which pretended to be a scientific laboratory through its high glass lights and indeed was a lurking place
My uncle pressed a cigarette on me and I took it and stood before the empty fireplace while he propped his umbrella in the corner deposited the new silk hat that was a little too big for him on the table blew copiously and produced a second cigar
It came into my head that he had shrunken very much in size since the Wimblehurst days that the cannon ball he had swallowed was rather more evident and shameless than it had been his skin less fresh and the nose between his glasses which still didnt quite fit much redder
And just then he seemed much laxer in his muscles and not quite as alertly quick in his movements
But he evidently wasnt aware of the degenerative nature of his changes as he sat there looking suddenly quite little under my eyes
Well George
he said quite happily unconscious of my silent criticism what do you think of it all
Well I said in the first placeits a damned swindle
Tut
tut
said my uncle
Its as straight as Its fair trading
So much the worse for trading I said
Its the sort of thing everybody does
After all theres no harm in the stuffand it may do good
It might do a lot of goodgiving people confidence frinstance against an epidemic
See
Why not
dont see where your swindle comes in
Hm I said
Its a thing you either see or dont see
Id like to know what sort of trading isnt a swindle in its way
Everybody who does a large advertised trade is selling something common on the strength of saying its uncommon
Look at Chicksonthey made him a baronet
Look at Lord Radmore who did it on lying about the alkali in soap
Rippin ads those were of his too
You dont mean to say you think doing this stuff up in bottles and swearing its the quintessence of strength and making poor devils buy it at that is straight
Why not George
How do we know it maynt be the quintessence to them so far as theyre concerned
Oh
I said and shrugged my shoulders
Theres Faith
You put Faith in em
I grant our labels are a bit emphatic
Christian Science really
No good setting people against the medicine
Tell me a solitary trade nowadays that hasnt to beemphatic
Its the modern way
Everybody understands iteverybody allows for it
But the world would be no worse and rather better if all this stuff of yours was run down a conduit into the Thames
Dont see that George at all
Mong other things all our people would be out of work
Unemployed
I grant you TonoBungay MAY benot QUITE so good a find for the world as Peruvian bark but the point is Georgeit MAKES TRADE
And the world lives on trade
Commerce
A romantic exchange of commodities and property
Romance
Magination
See
You must look at these things in a broad light
Look at the woodand forget the trees
And hang it George
we got to do these things
Theres no way unless you do
What do YOU mean to doanyhow
Theres ways of living I said Without either fraud or lying
Youre a bit stiff George
Theres no fraud in this affair Ill bet my hat
But what do you propose to do
Go as chemist to some one who IS running a business and draw a salary without a share like I offer you
Much sense in that
It comes out of the swindle as you call itjust the same
Some businesses are straight and quiet anyhow supply a sound article that is really needed dont shout advertisements
No George
There youre behind the times
The last of that sort was sold up bout five years ago
Well theres scientific research
And who pays for that
Who put up that big City and Guilds place at South Kensington
Enterprising business men
They fancy theyll have a bit of science going on they want a handy Expert ever and again and there you are
And what do you get for research when youve done it
Just a bare living and no outlook
They just keep you to make discoveries and if they fancy theyll use em they do
One can teach
How much a year George
How much a year
I suppose you must respect Carlyle
Well you take Carlyles testsolvency
Lord
what a book that French Revolution of his is
See what the world pays teachers and discoverers and what it pays business men
That shows the ones it really wants
Theres a justice in these big things George over and above the apparent injustice
I tell you it wants trade
Its Trade that makes the world go round
Argosies
Venice
Empire
My uncle suddenly rose to his feet
You think it over George
You think it over
And come up on Sunday to the new placewe got rooms in Gower Street nowand see your aunt
Shes often asked for you George often and often and thrown it up at me about that bit of propertythough Ive always said and always will that twentyfive shillings in the pound is what Ill pay you and interest up to the nail
And think it over
It isnt me I ask you to help
Its yourself
Its your aunt Susan
Its the whole concern
Its the commerce of your country
And we want you badly
I tell you straight I know my limitations
You could take this place you could make it go
I can see you at itlooking rather sour
Woosh is the word George
And he smiled endearingly
I got to dictate a letter he said ending the smile and vanished into the outer room
III I didnt succumb without a struggle to my uncles allurements
Indeed I held out for a week while I contemplated life and my prospects
It was a crowded and muddled contemplation
It invaded even my sleep
My interview with the Registrar my talk with my uncle my abrupt discovery of the hopeless futility of my passion for Marion had combined to bring me to sense of crisis
What was I going to do with life
I remember certain phases of my indecisions very well
I remember going home from our talk
I went down Farringdon Street to the Embankment because I thought to go home by Holborn and Oxford Street would be too crowded for thinking That piece of Embankment from Blackfriars to Westminster still reminds me of that momentous hesitation
You know from first to last I saw the business with my eyes open I saw its ethical and moral values quite clearly
Never for a moment do I remember myself faltering from my persuasion that the sale of TonoBungay was a thoroughly dishonest proceeding
The stuff was I perceived a mischievous trash slightly stimulating aromatic and attractive likely to become a bad habit and train people in the habitual use of stronger tonics and insidiously dangerous to people with defective kidneys
It would cost about sevenpence the large bottle to make including bottling and we were to sell it at half a crown plus the cost of the patent medicine stamp
A thing that I will confess deterred me from the outset far more than the sense of dishonesty in this affair was the supreme silliness of the whole concern
I still clung to the idea that the world of men was or should be a sane and just organisation and the idea that I should set myself gravely just at the fine springtime of my life to developing a monstrous bottling and packing warehouse bottling rubbish for the consumption of foolish credulous and depressed people had in it a touch of insanity
My early beliefs still clung to me
I felt assured that somewhere there must be a hitch in the fine prospect of ease and wealth under such conditions that somewhere a little overgrown perhaps but still traceable lay a neglected wasted path of use and honour for me
My inclination to refuse the whole thing increased rather than diminished at first as I went along the Embankment
In my uncles presence there had been a sort of glamour that had prevented an outright refusal
It was a revival of affection for him I felt in his presence I think in part and in part an instinctive feeling that I must consider him as my host
But much more was it a curious persuasion he had the knack of inspiringa persuasion not so much of his integrity and capacity as of the reciprocal and yielding foolishness of the world
One felt that he was silly and wild but in some way silly and wild after the fashion of the universe
After all one must live somehow
I astonished him and myself by temporising
No said I Ill think it over
And as I went along the embankment the first effect was all against my uncle
He shrankfor a little while he continued to shrinkin perspective until he was only a very small shabby little man in a dirty back street sending off a few hundred bottles of rubbish to foolish buyers
The great buildings on the right of us the Inns and the School Board placeas it was thenSomerset House the big hotels the great bridges Westminsters outlines ahead had an effect of grey largeness that reduced him to the proportions of a busy black beetle in a crack in the floor
And then my eye caught the advertisements on the south side of Sorbers Food of Cracknells Ferric Wine very bright and prosperous signs illuminated at night and I realised how astonishingly they looked at home there how evidently part they were in the whole thing
I saw a man come charging out of Palace Yardthe policeman touched his helmet to himwith a hat and a bearing astonishingly like my uncles
After alldidnt Cracknell himself sit in the House
TonoBungay shouted at me from a hoarding near Adelphi Terrace I saw it afar off near Carfax Street it cried out again upon me in Kensington High Street and burst into a perfect clamour six or seven times I saw it as I drew near my diggings
It certainly had an air of being something more than a dream
Yes I thought it overthoroughly enough Trade rules the world
Wealth rather than trade
The thing was true and true too was my uncles proposition that the quickest way to get wealth is to sell the cheapest thing possible in the dearest bottle
He was frightfully right after all
Pecunnia non oleta Roman emperor said that
Perhaps my great heroes in Plutarch were no more than such men fine now only because they are distant perhaps after all this Socialism to which I had been drawn was only a foolish dream only the more foolish because all its promises were conditionally true
Morris and these others played with it wittingly it gave a zest a touch of substance to their aesthetic pleasures
Never would there be good faith enough to bring such things about
They knew it every one except a few young fools knew it
As I crossed the corner of St Jamess Park wrapped in thought I dodged back just in time to escape a prancing pair of greys
A stout commonlooking woman very magnificently dressed regarded me from the carriage with a scornful eye
No doubt thought I a pillvendors wife Running through all my thoughts surging out like a refrain was my uncles masterstroke his admirable touch of praise Make it all slickand then make it go Woosh
I know you can
Oh
I KNOW you can
IV Ewart as a moral influence was unsatisfactory
I had made up my mind to put the whole thing before him partly to see how he took it and partly to hear how it sounded when it was said
I asked him to come and eat with me in an Italian place near Panton Street where one could get a curious interesting glutting sort of dinner for eighteenpence
He came with a disconcerting blackeye that he wouldnt explain
Not so much a blackeye he said as the aftermath of a purple patch Whats your difficulty
Ill tell you with the salad I said
But as a matter of fact I didnt tell him
I threw out that I was doubtful whether I ought to go into trade or stick to teaching in view of my deepening socialist proclivities and he warming with the unaccustomed generosity of a sixteenpenny Chianti ran on from that without any further inquiry as to my trouble
His utterances roved wide and loose
The reality of life my dear Ponderevo I remember him saying very impressively and punctuating with the nutcrackers as he spoke is Chromatic Conflict  and Form
Get hold of that and let all these other questions go
The Socialist will tell you one sort of colour and shape is right the Individualist another
What does it all amount to
What DOES it all amount to
NOTHING
I have no advice to give anyoneexcept to avoid regrets
Be yourself seek after such beautiful things as your own sense determines to be beautiful
And dont mind the headache in the morning For what after all is a morning Ponderevo
It isnt like the upper part of a day
He paused impressively
What Rot
I cried after a confused attempt to apprehend him
Isnt it
And its my bedrock wisdom in the matter
Take it or leave it my dear George take it or leave it
He put down the nutcrackers out of my reach and lugged a greasylooking notebook from his pocket
Im going to steal this mustard pot he said
I made noises of remonstrance
Only as a matter of design
Ive got to do an old beasts tomb
Wholesale grocer
Ill put it on his cornersfour mustard pots
I dare say hed be glad of a mustard plaster now to cool him poor devil where he is
But anyhowhere goes
V It came to me in the small hours that the real moral touchstone for this great doubting of mind was Marion
I lay composing statements of my problem and imagined myself delivering them to herand she goddesslike and beautiful giving her fine simplyworded judgment
You see its just to give ones self over to the Capitalistic System I imagined myself saying in good Socialist jargon its surrendering all ones beliefs
We MAY succeed we MAY grow rich but where would the satisfaction be
Then she would say No
That wouldnt be right
But the alternative is to wait
Then suddenly she would become a goddess
She would turn upon me frankly and nobly with shining eyes with arms held out
No she would say we love one another
Nothing ignoble shall ever touch us
We love one another
Why wait to tell each other that dear
What does it matter that we are poor and may keep poor
But indeed the conversation didnt go at all in that direction
At the sight of her my nocturnal eloquence became preposterous and all the moral values altered altogether
I had waited for her outside the door of the Parsianrobe establishment in Kensington High Street and walked home with her thence
I remember how she emerged into the warm evening light and that she wore a brown straw hat that made her for once not only beautiful but pretty
I like that hat I said by way of opening and she smiled her rare delightful smile at me
I love you I said in an undertone as we jostled closer on the pavement
She shook her head forbiddingly but she still smiled
Then Be sensible
The High Street pavement is too narrow and crowded for conversation and we were some way westward before we spoke again
Look here I said I want you Marion
Dont you understand
I want you
Now
she cried warningly
I do not know if the reader will understand how a passionate lover an immense admiration and desire can be shot with a gleam of positive hatred
Such a gleam there was in me at the serene selfcomplacency of that NOW
It vanished almost before I felt it
I found no warning in it of the antagonisms latent between us
Marion I said this isnt a trifling matter to me
I love you I would die to get you Dont you care
But what is the good
You dont care I cried
You dont care a rap
You know I care she answered
If I didnt If I didnt like you very much should I let you come and meet me go about with you
Well then I said promise to marry me
If I do what difference will it make
We were separated by two men carrying a ladder who drove between us unawares
Marion I asked when we got together again I tell you I want you to marry me
We cant
Why not
We cant marryin the street
We could take our chance
I wish you wouldnt go on talking like this
What is the good
She suddenly gave way to gloom
Its no good marrying she said
Ones only miserable
Ive seen other girls
When ones alone one has a little pocketmoney anyhow one can go about a little
But think of being married and no money and perhaps childrenyou cant be sure She poured out this concentrated philosophy of her class and type in jerky uncompleted sentences with knitted brows with discontented eyes towards the westward glowforgetful it seemed for a moment even of me
Look here Marion I said abruptly what would you marry on
What IS the good
she began
Would you marry on three hundred a year
She looked at me for a moment
Thats six pounds a week she said
One could manage on that easily
Smithies brotherNo he only gets two hundred and fifty
He married a typewriting girl
Will you marry me if I get three hundred a year
She looked at me again with a curious gleam of hope
IF
she said
I held out my hand and looked her in the eyes
Its a bargain I said
She hesitated and touched my hand for an instant
Its silly she remarked as she did so
It means really were She paused
Yes
said I
Engaged
Youll have to wait years
What good can it do you
Not so many years
I answered
For a moment she brooded
Then she glanced at me with a smile halfsweet halfwistful that has stuck in my memory for ever
I like you
she said
I shall like to be engaged to you
And faint on the threshold of hearing I caught her ventured dear
Its odd that in writing this down my memory passed over all that intervened and I feel it all again and once again Im Marions boyish lover taking great joy in such rare and little things
VI At last I went to the address my uncle had given me in Gower Street and found my aunt Susan waiting tea for him
Directly I came into the room I appreciated the change in outlook that the achievement of TonoBungay had made almost as vividly as when I saw my uncles new hat
The furniture of the room struck upon my eye as almost stately
The chairs and sofa were covered with chintz which gave it a dim remote flavour of Bladesover the mantel the cornice the gas pendant were larger and finer than the sort of thing I had grown accustomed to in London
And I was shown in by a real housemaid with real tails to her cap and great quantities of reddish hair
There was my aunt too looking bright and pretty in a bluepatterned teawrap with bows that seemed to me the quintessence of fashion
She was sitting in a chair by the open window with quite a pile of yellowlabelled books on the occasional table beside her
Before the large paperdecorated fireplace stood a threetiered cakestand displaying assorted cakes and a tray with all the tea equipage except the teapot was on the large centretable
The carpet was thick and a spice of adventure was given it by a number of dyed sheepskin mats
Hello
said my aunt as I appeared
Its George
Shall I serve the tea now Mem
said the real housemaid surveying our greeting coldly
Not till Mr Ponderevo comes Meggie said my aunt and grimaced with extraordinary swiftness and virulence as the housemaid turned her back
Meggie she calls herself said my aunt as the door closed and left me to infer a certain want of sympathy
Youre looking very jolly aunt said I
What do you think of all this old Business hes got
asked my aunt
Seems a promising thing I said
I suppose there is a business somewhere
Havent you seen it 
Fraid Id say something AT it George if I did
So he wont let me
It came on quite suddenly
Brooding he was and writing letters and sizzling something awfullike a chestnut going to pop
Then he came home one day saying TonoBungay till I thought he was clean off his onion and singingwhat was it
Im afloat Im afloat I guessed
The very thing
Youve heard him
And saying our fortunes were made
Took me out to the Hoburm Restaurant Georgedinner and we had champagne stuff that blows up the back of your nose and makes you go SO and he said at last hed got things worthy of meand we moved here next day
Its a swell house George
Three pounds a week for the rooms
And he says the Businessll stand it
She looked at me doubtfully
Either do that or smash I said profoundly
We discussed the question for a moment mutely with our eyes
My aunt slapped the pile of books from Mudies
Ive been having such a Go of reading George
You never did
What do you think of the business
I asked
Well theyve let him have money she said and thought and raised her eyebrows
Its been a time she went on
The flapping about
Me sitting doing nothing and him on the go like a rocket
Hes done wonders
But he wants you Georgehe wants you
Sometimes hes full of hopetalks of when were going to have a carriage and be in societymakes it seem so natural and topsyturvy I hardly know whether my old heels arent up here listening to him and my old head on the floor Then he gets depressed
Says he wants restraint
Says he can make a splash but cant keep on
Says if you dont come in everything will smashBut you are coming in
She paused and looked at me
Well You dont say you wont come in
But look here aunt I said do you understand quite
Its a quack medicine
Its trash
Theres no law against selling quack medicine that I know of said my aunt
She thought for a minute and became unusually grave
Its our only chance George she said
If it doesnt go There came the slamming of a door and a loud bellowing from the next apartment through the folding doors
Hereer Shee Rulk lies Poo Tom Booling
Silly old Concertina
Hark at him George
She raised her voice
Dont sing that you old Walrus you
Sing Im afloat
One leaf of the folding doors opened and my uncle appeared
Hullo George
Come along at last
Gossome teacake Susan
Thought it over George
he said abruptly
Yes said I
Coming in
I paused for a last moment and nodded yes
Ah
he cried
Why couldnt you say that a week ago
Ive had false ideas about the world I said
Oh
they dont matter now
Yes Ill come Ill take my chance with you I wont hesitate again
And I didnt
I stuck to that resolution for seven long years
CHAPTER THE THIRD HOW WE MADE TONOBUNGAY HUM I So I made my peace with my uncle and we set out upon this bright enterprise of selling slightly injurious rubbish at oneandthreehalfpence and twoandnine a bottle including the Government stamp
We made TonoBungay hum
It brought us wealth influence respect the confidence of endless people
All that my uncle promised me proved truth and understatement TonoBungay carried me to freedoms and powers that no life of scientific research no passionate service of humanity could ever have given me
It was my uncles genius that did it
No doubt he needed meI was I will admit his indispensable right hand but his was the brain to conceive
He wrote every advertisement some of them even he sketched
You must remember that his were the days before the Time took to enterprise and the vociferous hawking of that antiquated Encyclopedia
That alluring buttonholing letme justtellyouquitesoberlysomethingyououghttoknow style of newspaper advertisement with every now and then a convulsive jump of some attractive phrase into capitals was then almost a novelty
Many people who are MODERATELY well think they are QUITE well was one of his early efforts
The jerks in capitals were DO NOT NEED DRUGS OR MEDICINE and SIMPLY A PROPER REGIMEN TO GET YOU IN TONE
One was warned against the chemist or druggist who pushed muchadvertised nostrums on ones attention
That trash did more harm than good
The thing needed was regimenand TonoBungay
Very early too was that bright little quarter column at least it was usually a quarter column in the evening papers HILARITYTonoBungay
Like Mountain Air in the Veins
The penetrating trio of questions Are you bored with your Business
Are you bored with your Dinner
Are you bored with your Wife
that too was in our Gower Street days
Both these we had in our first campaign when we worked London south central and west and then too we had our first posterthe HEALTH BEAUTY AND STRENGTH one
That was his design I happen still to have got by me the first sketch he made for it
I have reproduced it here with one or two others to enable the reader to understand the mental quality that initiated these familiar ornaments of London
The second one is about eighteen months later the germ of the wellknown Fog poster the third was designed for an influenza epidemic but never issued
These things were only incidental in my department
I had to polish them up for the artist and arrange the business of printing and distribution and after my uncle had had a violent and needless quarrel with the advertising manager of the Daily Regulator about the amount of display given to one of his happy thoughts I also took up the negotiations of advertisements for the press
We discussed and worked out distribution together first in the drawingroom floor in Gower Street with my aunt sometimes helping very shrewdly and then with a steadily improving type of cigar and older and older whisky in his smuggery at their first house the one in Beckenham
Often we worked far into the night sometimes until dawn
We really worked infernally hard and I recall we worked with a very decided enthusiasm not simply on my uncles part but mine It was a game an absurd but absurdly interesting game and the points were scored in cases of bottles
People think a happy notion is enough to make a man rich that fortunes can be made without toil
Its a dream as every millionaire except one or two lucky gamblers can testify I doubt if JD
Rockefeller in the early days of Standard Oil worked harder than we did
We worked far into the nightand we also worked all day
We made a rule to be always dropping in at the factory unannounced to keep things rightfor at first we could afford no properly responsible underlingsand we traveled London pretending to be our own representatives and making all sorts of special arrangements
But none of this was my special work and as soon as we could get other men in I dropped the traveling though my uncle found it particularly interesting and kept it up for years
Does me good George to see the chaps behind their counters like I was once he explained
My special and distinctive duty was to give TonoBungay substance and an outward and visible bottle to translate my uncles great imaginings into the creation of case after case of labelled bottles of nonsense and the punctual discharge of them by railway road and steamer towards their ultimate goal in the Great Stomach of the People
By all modern standards the business was as my uncle would say absolutely bona fide
We sold our stuff and got the money and spent the money honestly in lies and clamour to sell more stuff
Section by section we spread it over the whole of the British Isles first working the middleclass London suburbs then the outer suburbs then the home counties then going with new bills and a more pious style of ad into Wales a great field always for a new patentmedicine and then into Lancashire
My uncle had in his inner office a big map of England and as we took up fresh sections of the local press and our consignments invaded new areas flags for advertisements and pink underlines for orders showed our progress
The romance of modern commerce George
my uncle would say rubbing his hands together and drawing in air through his teeth
The romance of modern commerce eh
Conquest
Province by province
Like sogers
We subjugated England and Wales we rolled over the Cheviots with a special adaptation containing eleven per cent
of absolute alcohol TonoBungay Thistle Brand
We also had the Fog poster adapted to a kilted Briton in a misty Highland scene
Under the shadow of our great leading line we were presently taking subsidiary specialties into action TonoBungay Hair Stimulant was our first supplement
Then came Concentrated TonoBungay for the eyes
That didnt go but we had a considerable success with the Hair Stimulant
We broached the subject I remember in a little catechism beginning Why does the hair fall out
Because the follicles are fagged
What are the follicles
So it went on to the climax that the Hair Stimulant contained all The essential principles of that most reviving tonic TonoBungay together with an emollient and nutritious oil derived from crude Neats Foot Oil by a process of refinement separation and deodorization
It will be manifest to any one of scientific attainments that in Neats Foot Oil derived from the hoofs and horns of beasts we must necessarily have a natural skin and hair lubricant
And we also did admirable things with our next subsidiaries TonoBungay Lozenges and TonoBungay Chocolate
These we urged upon the public for their extraordinary nutritive and recuperative value in cases of fatigue and strain
We gave them posters and illustrated advertisements showing climbers hanging from marvelously vertical cliffs cyclist champions upon the track mounted messengers engaged in AixtoGhent rides soldiers lying out in action under a hot sun
You can GO for twentyfour hours we declared on TonoBungay Chocolate
We didnt say whether you could return on the same commodity
We also showed a dreadfully barristerish barrister wig sidewhiskers teeth a horribly lifelike portrait of all existing barristers talking at a table and beneath this legend A Four Hours Speech on TonoBungay Lozenges and as fresh as when he began
Then brought in regiments of schoolteachers revivalist ministers politicians and the like
I really do believe there was an element of kick in the strychnine in these lozenges especially in those made according to our earlier formula
For we altered all our formulaeinvariably weakening them enormously as sales got ahead
In a little whileso it seems to me nowwe were employing travelers and opening up Great Britain at the rate of a hundred square miles a day
All the organisation throughout was sketched in a crude entangled halfinspired fashion by my uncle and all of it had to be worked out into a practicable scheme of quantities and expenditure by me
We had a lot of trouble finding our travelers in the end at least half of them were IrishAmericans a wonderful breed for selling medicine
We had still more trouble over our factory manager because of the secrets of the inner room and in the end we got a very capable woman Mrs Hampton Diggs who had formerly managed a large millinery workroom whom we could trust to keep everything in good working order without finding out anything that wasnt put exactly under her loyal and energetic nose
She conceived a high opinion of TonoBungay and took it in all forms and large quantities so long as I knew her
It didnt seem to do her any harm
And she kept the girls going quite wonderfully
My uncles last addition to the TonoBungay group was the TonoBungay Mouthwash
The reader has probably read a hundred times that inspiring inquiry of his You are Young Yet but are you Sure Nothing has Aged your Gums
And after that we took over the agency for three or four good American lines that worked in with our own and could be handled with it Texan Embrocation and 23to clear the system were the chief
I set down these bare facts
To me they are all linked with the figure of my uncle
In some of the old seventeenth and early eighteenth century prayerbooks at Bladesover there used to be illustrations with long scrolls coming out of the mouths of the woodcut figures
I wish I could write all this last chapter on a scroll coming out of the head of my uncle show it all the time as unfolding and pouring out from a short fattening smalllegged man with stiff cropped hair disobedient glasses on a perky little nose and a round stare behind them
I wish I could show you him breathing hard and a little through his nose as his pen scrabbled out some absurd inspiration for a poster or a picture page and make you hear his voice charged with solemn import like the voice of a squeaky prophet saying George
listn
I got an ideer
I got a notion
George
I should put myself into the same picture
Best setting for us I think would be the Beckenham snuggery because there we worked hardest
It would be the lamplit room of the early nineties and the clock upon the mantel would indicate midnight or later
We would be sitting on either side of the fire I with a pipe my uncle with a cigar or cigarette
There would be glasses standing inside the brass fender
Our expressions would be very grave
My uncle used to sit right back in his armchair his toes always turned in when he was sitting down and his legs had a way of looking curved as though they hadnt bones or joints but were stuffed with sawdust
George whadyer think of TB
for seasickness
he would say
No good that I can imagine
Oom
No harm TRYING George
We can but try
I would suck my pipe
Hard to get at
Unless we sold our stuff specially at the docks
Might do a special at Cooks office or in the Continental Bradshaw
It ud give em confidence George
He would Zzzz with his glasses reflecting the red of the glowing coals
No good hiding our light under a Bushel he would remark
I never really determined whether my uncle regarded TonoBungay as a fraud or whether he didnt come to believe in it in a kind of way by the mere reiteration of his own assertions
I think that his average attitude was one of kindly almost parental toleration
I remember saying on one occasion But you dont suppose this stuff ever did a human being the slightest good all
and how his face assumed a look of protest as of one reproving harshness and dogmatism
Youve a hard nature George he said
Youre too ready to run things down
How can one TELL
How can one venture to TELL
I suppose any creative and developing game would have interested me in those years
At any rate I know I put as much zeal into this TonoBungay as any young lieutenant could have done who suddenly found himself in command of a ship
It was extraordinarily interesting to me to figure out the advantage accruing from this shortening of the process or that and to weigh it against the capital cost of the alteration
I made a sort of machine for sticking on the labels that I patented to this day there is a little trickle of royalties to me from that
I also contrived to have our mixture made concentrated got the bottles which all came sliding down a guarded slantway nearly filled with distilled water at one tap and dripped our magic ingredients in at the next
This was an immense economy of space for the inner sanctum
For the bottling we needed special taps and these too I invented and patented
We had a sort of endless band of bottles sliding along an inclined glass trough made slippery with running water
At one end a girl held them up to the light put aside any that were imperfect and placed the others in the trough the filling was automatic at the other end a girl slipped in the cork and drove it home with a little mallet
Each tank the little one for the vivifying ingredients and the big one for distilled water had a level indicator and inside I had a float arrangement that stopped the slide whenever either had sunk too low
Another girl stood ready with my machine to label the corked bottles and hand them to the three packers who slipped them into their outer papers and put them with a pad of corrugated paper between each pair into a little groove from which they could be made to slide neatly into position in our standard packingcase
It sounds wild I know but I believe I was the first man in the city of London to pack patent medicines through the side of the packingcase to discover there was a better way in than by the lid
Our cases packed themselves practically had only to be put into position on a little wheeled tray and when full pulled to the lift that dropped them to the men downstairs who padded up the free space and nailed on top and side
Our girls moreover packed with corrugated paper and matchbookwood box partitions when everybody else was using expensive young men to pack through the top of the box with straw many breakages and much waste and confusion
II As I look back at them now those energetic years seem all compacted to a year or so from the days of our first hazardous beginning in Farringdon Street with barely a thousand pounds worth of stuff or credit all toldand that got by something perilously like snatchingto the days when my uncle went to the public on behalf of himself and me onetenth share and our silent partners the drug wholesalers and the printing people and the owner of that group of magazines and newspapers to ask with honest confidence for L150000
Those silent partners were remarkably sorry I know that they had not taken larger shares and given us longer credit when the subscriptions came pouring in
My uncle had a clear half to play with including the onetenth understood to be mine
L150000think of itfor the goodwill in a string of lies and a trade in bottles of mitigated water
Do you realise the madness of the world that sanctions such a thing
Perhaps you dont
At times use and wont certainly blinded me
If it had not been for Ewart I dont think I should have had an inkling of the wonderfulness of this development of my fortunes I should have grown accustomed to it fallen in with all its delusions as completely as my uncle presently did
He was immensely proud of the flotation
Theyve never been given such value he said for a dozen years
But Ewart with his gesticulating hairy hands and bony wrists his singlehanded chorus to all this as it played itself over again in my memory and he kept my fundamental absurdity illuminated for me during all this astonishing time
Its just on all fours with the rest of things he remarked only more so
You neednt think youre anything out of the way
I remember one disquisition very distinctly
It was just after Ewart had been to Paris on a mysterious expedition to rough in some work for a rising American sculptor
This young man had a commission for an allegorical figure of Truth draped of course for his State Capitol and he needed help
Ewart had returned with his hair cut en brosse and with his costume completely translated into French
He wore I remember a bicycling suit of purplishbrown baggy beyond ageingthe only creditable thing about it was that it had evidently not been made for hima voluminous black tie a decadent soft felt hat and several French expletives of a sinister description
Silly clothes arent they
he said at the sight of my startled eye
I dont know why I gotm
They seemed all right over there
He had come down to our Raggett Street place to discuss a benevolent project of mine for a poster by him and he scattered remarkable discourse over the heads I hope it was over the heads of our bottlers
What I like about it all Ponderevo is its poetry Thats where we get the pull of the animals
No animal would ever run a factory like this
Think
One remembers the Beaver of course
He might very possibly bottle things but would he stick a label round em and sell em
The Beaver is a dreamy fool Ill admit him and his dams but after all theres a sort of protection about em a kind of muddy practicality
They prevent things getting at him
And its not your poetry only
Its the poetry of the customer too
Poet answering to poetsoul to soul
Health Strength and Beautyin a bottlethe magic philtre
Like a fairy tale Think of the people to whom your bottles of footle go
Im calling it footle Ponderevo out of praise he said in parenthesis
Think of the little clerks and jaded women and overworked people
People overstrained with wanting to do people overstrained with wanting to be People in fact overstrained
The real trouble of life Ponderevo isnt that we existthats a vulgar error the real trouble is that we DONT really exist and we want to
Thats what thisin the highest sensejust stands for
The hunger to befor oncereally aliveto the finger tips
Nobody wants to do and be the things people arenobody
YOU dont want to preside over thisthis bottling I dont want to wear these beastly clothes and be led about by you nobody wants to keep on sticking labels on silly bottles at so many farthings a gross
That isnt existing
Thatssussubstratum
None of us want to be what we are or to do what we do
Except as a sort of basis
What do we want
You know
I know
Nobody confesses
What we all want to be is something perpetually young and beautifulyoung Jovesyoung Joves Ponderevo his voice became loud harsh and declamatorypursuing coy halfwilling nymphs through everlasting forests
There was a justperceptible listening hang in the work about us
Come downstairs I interrupted we can talk better there
I can talk better here he answered
He was just going on but fortunately the implacable face of Mrs Hampton Diggs appeared down the aisle of bottling machines
All right he said Ill come
In the little sanctum below my uncle was taking a digestive pause after his lunch and by no means alert
His presence sent Ewart back to the theme of modern commerce over the excellent cigar my uncle gave him
He behaved with the elaborate deference due to a business magnate from an unknown man
What I was pointing out to your nephew sir said Ewart putting both elbows on the table was the poetry of commerce
He doesnt you know seem to see it at all
My uncle nodded brightly
Whad I tell im he said round his cigar
We are artists
You and I sir can talk if you will permit me as one artist to another
Its advertisement hasdone it
Advertisement has revolutionised trade and industry it is going to revolutionise the world
The old merchant used to tote about commodities the new one creates values
Doesnt need to tote
He takes something that isnt worth anythingor something that isnt particularly worth anythingand he makes it worth something
He takes mustard that is just like anybody elses mustard and he goes about saying shouting singing chalking on walls writing inside peoples books putting it everywhere Smiths Mustard is the Best
And behold it is the best
True said my uncle chubbily and with a dreamy sense of mysticism true
Its just like an artist he takes a lump of white marble on the verge of a limekiln he chips it about he makeshe makes a monument to himselfand othersa monument the world will not willingly let die
Talking of mustard sir I was at Clapham Junction the other day and all the banks are overgrown with horse radish thats got loose from a garden somewhere
You know what horseradish isgrows like wildfirespreads spreads
I stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and thinking about it
Like fame I thought rank and wild where it isnt wanted
Why dont the really good things in life grow like horseradish
I thought
My mind went off in a peculiar way it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tinI bought some the other day for a ham I had
It came into my head that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to adulterate mustard
I had a sort of idea that I could plunge into business on that get rich and come back to my own proper monumental art again
And then I said But why adulterate
I dont like the idea of adulteration
Shabby said my uncle nodding his head
Bound to get found out
And totally unnecessary too
Why not do up a mixturethreequarters pounded horseradish and a quarter mustardgive it a fancy nameand sell it at twice the mustard price
See
I very nearly started the business straight away only something happened
My train came along
Jolly good ideer said my uncle
He looked at me
That really is an ideer George he said
Take shavins again
You know that poem of Longfellows sir that sounds exactly like the first declension
What is itMarrs a maker men say
My uncle nodded and gurgled some quotation that died away
Jolly good poem George he said in an aside to me
Well its about a carpenter and a poetic Victorian child you know and some shavins
The child made no end out of the shavins
So might you
Powder em
They might be anything
Soak em in jipperXylotobacco
Powderem and get a little tar and turpentinous smell inwoodpacking for hot bathsa Certain Cure for the scourge of Influenza
Theres all these patent grain foodswhat Americans call cereals
I believe Im right sir in saying theyre sawdust
No
said my uncle removing his cigar as far as I can find out its really grainspoilt grain
Ive been going into that
Well there you are
said Ewart
Say its spoilt grain
It carried out my case just as well
Your modern commerce is no more buying and selling than sculpture
Its mercyits salvation
Its rescue work
It takes all sorts of fallen commodities by the hand and raises them
Cana isnt in it
You turn waterinto TonoBungay
TonoBungays all right said my uncle suddenly grave
We arent talking of TonoBungay
Your nephew sir is hard he wants everything to go to a sort of predestinated end hes a Calvinist of Commerce
Offer him a dustbin full of stuff he calls it refusepasses by on the other side
Now YOU sir youd make cinders respect themselves
My uncle regarded him dubiously for a moment
But there was a touch of appreciation in his eye
Might make em into a sort of sanitary brick he reflected over his cigar end
Or a friable biscuit
Why NOT
You might advertise Why are Birds so Bright
Because they digest their food perfectly
Why do they digest their food so perfectly
Because they have a gizzard
Why hasnt man a gizzard
Because he can buy Ponderevos Asphalt Triturating Friable BiscuitWhich is Better
He delivered the last words in a shout with his hairy hand flourished in the air Damn clever fellow said my uncle after he had one
I know a man when I see one
Hed do
But drunk I should say
But that only makes some chap brighter 
If he WANTS to do that poster he can
Zzzz
That ideer of his about the horseradish
Theres something in that George
Im going to think over that I may say at once that my poster project came to nothing in the end though Ewart devoted an interesting week to the matter
He let his unfortunate disposition to irony run away with him
He produced a picture of two beavers with a subtle likeness he said to myself and my unclethe likeness to my uncle certainly wasnt half badand they were bottling rows and rows of TonoBungay with the legend Modern commerce
It certainly wouldnt have sold a case though he urged it on me one cheerful evening on the ground that it would arouse curiosity
In addition he produced a quite shocking study of my uncle excessively and needlessly nude but so far as I was able to judge an admirable likeness engaged in feats of strength of a Gargantuan type before an audience of deboshed and shattered ladies
The legend Health Beauty Strength below gave a needed point to his parody
This he hung up in the studio over the oil shop with a flap of brown paper by way of a curtain over it to accentuate its libellous offence
CHAPTER THE FOURTH MARION I As I look back on those days in which we built up the great TonoBungay property out of human hope and credit for bottles and rent and printing I see my life as it were arranged in two parallel columns of unequal width a wider more diffused eventful and various one which continually broadens out the business side of my life and a narrow darker and darkling one shot ever and again with a gleam of happiness my homelife with Marion
For of course I married Marion
I didnt as a matter of fact marry her until a year after TonoBungay was thoroughly afloat and then only after conflicts and discussions of a quite strenuous sort
By that time I was twentyfour
It seems the next thing to childhood now
We were both in certain directions unusually ignorant and simple we were temperamentally antagonistic and we hadntI dont think we were capable ofan idea in common
She was young and extraordinarily conventionalshe seemed never to have an idea of her own but always the idea of her classand I was young and sceptical enterprising and passionate the two links that held us together were the intense appeal her physical beauty had for me and her appreciation of her importance in my thoughts
There can be no doubt of my passion for her
In her I had discovered woman desired
The nights I have lain awake on account of her writhing biting my wrists in a fever of longing

I have told how I got myself a silk hat and black coat to please her on Sundayto the derision of some of my fellowstudents who charged to meet me and how we became engaged
But that was only the beginning of our difference
To her that meant the beginning of a not unpleasant little secrecy an occasional use of verbal endearments perhaps even kisses
It was something to go on indefinitely interfering in no way with her gossiping spells of work at Smithies
To me it was a pledge to come together into the utmost intimacy of soul and body so soon as we could contrive it
I dont know if it will strike the reader that I am setting out to discuss the queer unwise love relationship and my bungle of a marriage with excessive solemnity
But to me it seems to reach out to vastly wider issues than our little personal affair
Ive thought over my life
In these last few years Ive tried to get at least a little wisdom out of it
And in particular Ive thought over this part of my life
Im enormously impressed by the ignorant unguided way in which we two entangled ourselves with each other
It seems to me the queerest thing in all this network of misunderstandings and misstatements and faulty and ramshackle conventions which makes up our social order as the individual meets it that we should have come together so accidentally and so blindly
Because we were no more than samples of the common fate
Love is not only the cardinal fact in the individual life but the most important concern of the community after all the way in which the young people of this generation pair off determines the fate of the nation all the other affairs of the State are subsidiary to that
And we leave it to flushed and blundering youth to stumble on its own significance with nothing to guide in but shocked looks and sentimental twaddle and base whisperings and cantsmeared examples
I have tried to indicate something of my own sexual development in the preceding chapter
Nobody was ever frank and decent with me in this relation nobody no book ever came and said to me thus and thus is the world made and so and so is necessary
Everything came obscurely indefinitely perplexingly and all I knew of law or convention in the matter had the form of threatenings and prohibitions
Except through the furtive shameful talk of my coevals at Goudhurst and Wimblehurst I was not even warned against quite horrible dangers
My ideas were made partly of instinct partly of a romantic imagination partly woven out of a medley of scraps of suggestion that came to me haphazard
I had read widely and confusedly Vathek Shelley Tom Paine Plutarch Carlyle Haeckel William Morris the Bible the Freethinker the Clarion The Woman Who DidI mention the ingredients that come first to mind
All sorts of ideas were jumbled up in me and never a lucid explanation
But it was evident to me that the world regarded Shelley for example as a very heroic as well as beautiful person and that to defy convention and succumb magnificently to passion was the proper thing to do to gain the respect and affection of all decent people
And the makeup of Marions mind in the matter was an equally irrational affair
Her training had been one not simply of silences but suppressions
An enormous force of suggestion had so shaped her that the intense natural fastidiousness of girlhood had developed into an absolute perversion of instinct
For all that is cardinal in this essential business of life she had one inseparable epithethorrid
Without any such training she would have been a shy lover but now she was an impossible one
For the rest she had derived I suppose partly from the sort of fiction she got from the Public Library and partly from the workroom talk at Smithies
So far as the former origin went she had an idea of love as a state of worship and service on the part of the man and of condescension on the part of the woman
There was nothing horrid about it in any fiction she had read
The man gave presents did services sought to be in every way delightful
The woman went out with him smiled at him was kissed by him in decorous secrecy and if he chanced to offend denied her countenance and presence
Usually she did something for his good to him made him go to church made him give up smoking or gambling smartened him up
Quite at the end of the story came a marriage and after that the interest ceased
That was the tenor of Marions fiction but I think the worktable conversation at Smithies did something to modify that
At Smithies it was recognised I think that a fellow was a possession to be desired that it was better to be engaged to a fellow than not that fellows had to be keptthey might be mislaid they might even be stolen
There was a case of stealing at Smithies and many tears
Smithie I met before we were married and afterwards she became a frequent visitor to our house at Ealing
She was a thin brighteyed hawknosed girl of thirtyodd with prominent teeth a highpitched eager voice and a disposition to be urgently smart in her dress
Her hats were startling and various but invariably disconcerting and she talked in a rapid nervous flow that was hilarious rather than witty and broken by little screams of Oh my dear
and you never did
She was the first woman I ever met who used scent
Poor old Smithie
What a harmless kindly soul she really was and how heartily I detested her
Out of the profits on the Persian robes she supported a sisters family of three children she helped a worthless brother and overflowed in help even to her workgirls but that didnt weigh with me in those youthfullynarrow times
It was one of the intense minor irritations of my married life that Smithies whirlwind chatter seemed to me to have far more influence with Marion than anything I had to say
Before all things I coveted her grip upon Marions inaccessible mind
In the workroom at Smithies I gathered they always spoke of me demurely as A Certain Person
I was rumoured to be dreadfully clever and there were doubtsnot altogether without justificationof the sweetness of my temper
II Well these general explanations will enable the reader to understand the distressful times we two had together when presently I began to feel on a footing with Marion and to fumble conversationally for the mind and the wonderful passion I felt obstinately and stupidity must be in her
I think she thought me the maddest of sane men clever in fact which at Smithies was I suppose the next thing to insanity a word intimating incomprehensible and incalculable motives She could be shocked at anything she misunderstood everything and her weapon was a sulky silence that knitted her brows spoilt her mouth and robbed her face of beauty
Well if we cant agree I dont see why you should go on talking she used to say
That would always enrage me beyond measure
Or Im afraid Im not clever enough to understand that
Silly little people
I see it all now but then I was no older than she and I couldnt see anything but that Marion for some inexplicable reason wouldnt come alive
We would contrive semisurreptitious walks on Sunday and part speechless with the anger of indefinable offences
Poor Marion
The things I tried to put before her my fermenting ideas about theology about Socialism about aestheticsthe very words appalled her gave her the faint chill of approaching impropriety the terror of a very present intellectual impossibility
Then by an enormous effort I would suppress myself for a time and continue a talk that made her happy about Smithies brother about the new girl who had come to the workroom about the house we would presently live in
But there we differed a little
I wanted to be accessible to St Pauls or Cannon Street Station and she had set her mind quite resolutely upon Eating
It wasnt by any means quarreling all the time you understand
She liked me to play the lover nicely she liked the effect of going aboutwe had lunches we went to Earls Court to Kew to theatres and concerts but not often to concerts because though Marion liked music she didnt like too much of it to picture showsand there was a nonsensical sort of babytalk I picked upI forget where nowthat became a mighty peacemaker
Her worst offence for me was an occasional excursion into the Smithie style of dressing debased West Kensington
For she had no sense at all of her own beauty
She had no comprehension whatever of beauty of the body and she could slash her beautiful lines to rags with hatbrims and trimmings
Thank Heaven
a natural refinement a natural timidity and her extremely slender purse kept her from the real Smithie efflorescence
Poor simple beautiful kindly limited Marion
Now that I am fortyfive I can look back at her with all my old admiration and none of my old bitterness with a new affection and not a scrap of passion and take her part against the equally stupid drivinglyenergetic sensuous intellectual sprawl I used to be
I was a young beast for her to have marrieda hound beast
With her it was my business to understand and controland I exacted fellowship passion We became engaged as I have told we broke it off and joined again
We went through a succession of such phases
We had no sort of idea what was wrong with us
Presently we were formally engaged
I had a wonderful interview with her father in which he was stupendously grave and Hless wanted to know about my origins and was tolerant exasperatingly tolerant because my mother was a servant and afterwards her mother took to kissing me and I bought a ring
But the speechless aunt I gathered didnt approvehaving doubts of my religiosity
Whenever we were estranged we could keep apart for days and to begin with every such separation was a relief
And then I would want her a restless longing would come upon me
I would think of the flow of her arms of the soft gracious bend of her body
I would lie awake or dream of a transfigured Marion of light and fire
It was indeed Dame Nature driving me on to womankind in her stupid inexorable way but I thought it was the need of Marion that troubled me
So I always went back to Marion at last and made it up and more or less conceded or ignored whatever thing had parted us and more and more I urged her to marry me
In the long run that became a fixed idea
It entangled my will and my pride I told myself I was not going to be beaten
I hardened to the business
I think as a matter of fact my real passion for Marion had waned enormously long before we were married that she had lived it down by sheer irresponsiveness
When I felt sure of my three hundred a year she stipulated for delay twelve months delay to see how things would turn out
There were times when she seemed simply an antagonist holding out irritatingly against something I had to settle
Moreover I began to be greatly distracted by the interest and excitement of TonoBungays success by the change and movement in things the going to and fro
I would forget her for days together and then desire her with an irritating intensity at last one Saturday afternoon after a brooding morning I determined almost savagely that these delays must end
I went off to the little home at Walham Green and made Marion come with me to Putney Common
Marion wasnt at home when I got there and I had to fret for a time and talk to her father who was just back from his office he explained and enjoying himself in his own way in the greenhouse
Im going to ask your daughter to marry me
I said
I think weve been waiting long enough
I dont approve of long engagements either said her father
But Marion will have her own way about it anyhow
Seen this new powdered fertiliser
I went in to talk to Mrs Ramboat
Shell want time to get her things said Mrs Ramboat
I and Marion sat down together on a little seat under some trees at the top of Putney Hill and I came to my point abruptly
Look here Marion I said are you going to marry me or are you not
She smiled at me
Well she said were engagedarent we
That cant go on for ever
Will you marry me next week
She looked me in the face
We cant she said
You promised to marry me when I had three hundred a year
She was silent for a space
Cant we go on for a time as we are
We COULD marry on three hundred a year
But it means a very little house
Theres Smithies brother
They manage on two hundred and fifty but thats very little
She says they have a semidetached house almost on the road and hardly a bit of garden
And the wall to nextdoor is so thin they hear everything
When her baby criesthey rap
And people stand against the railings and talk Cant we wait
Youre doing so well
An extraordinary bitterness possessed me at this invasion of the stupendous beautiful business of love by sordid necessity
I answered her with immense restraint
If I said we could have a doublefronted detached houseat Ealing saywith a square patch of lawn in front and a garden behindandand a tiled bathroom That would be sixty pounds a year at least
Which means five hundred a year
Yes well you see I told my uncle I wanted that and Ive got it
Got what
Five hundred pounds a year
Five hundred pounds
I burst into laughter that had more than a taste of bitterness
Yes I said really
and NOW what do you think
Yes she said a little flushed but be sensible
Do you really mean youve got a Rise all at once of two hundred a year
To marry onyes
She scrutinised me a moment
Youve done this as a surprise
she said and laughed at my laughter
She had become radiant and that made me radiant too
Yes I said yes and laughed no longer bitterly
She clasped her hands and looked me in the eyes
She was so pleased that I forgot absolutely my disgust of a moment before
I forgot that she had raised her price two hundred pounds a year and that I had bought her at that
Come
I said standing up lets go towards the sunset dear and talk about it all
Do you knowthis is a most beautiful world an amazingly beautiful world and when the sunset falls upon you it makes you into shining gold
No not goldinto golden glass
Into something better that either glass or gold
And for all that evening I wooed her and kept her glad
She made me repeat my assurances over again and still doubted a little
We furnished that doublefronted house from atticit ran to an atticto cellar and created a garden
Do you know Pampas Grass
said Marion
I love Pampas Grass if there is room
You shall have Pampas Grass I declared
And there were moments as we went in imagination about that house together when my whole being cried out to take her in my armsnow
But I refrained
On that aspect of life I touched very lightly in that talk very lightly because I had had my lessons
She promised to marry me within two months time
Shyly reluctantly she named a day and next afternoon in heat and wrath we broke it off again for the last time
We split upon procedure
I refused flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake in white favours carriages and the rest of it
It dawned upon me suddenly in conversation with her and her mother that this was implied
I blurted out my objection forthwith and this time it wasnt any ordinary difference of opinion it was a row
I dont remember a quarter of the things we flung out in that dispute
I remember her mother reiterating in tones of gentle remonstrance But George dear you must have a caketo send home
I think we all reiterated things
I seem to remember a refrain of my own A marriage is too sacred a thing too private a thing for this display
Her father came in and stood behind me against the wall and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard and stood with arms looking from speaker to speaker a sternly gratified prophetess
It didnt occur to me then
How painful it was to Marion for these people to witness my rebellion
But George said her father what sort of marriage do you want
You dont want to go to one of those there registry offices
Thats exactly what Id like to do
Marriage is too private a thing I shouldnt feel married said Mrs Ramboat
Look here Marion I said we are going to be married at a registry office
I dont believe in all these fripperies and superstitions and I wont submit to them
Ive agreed to all sorts of things to please you
Whats he agreed to
said her fatherunheeded
I cant marry at a registry office said Marion sallowwhite
Very well I said
Ill marry nowhere else
I cant marry at a registry office
Very well I said standing up white and tense and it amazed me but I was also exultant then we wont marry at all
She leant forward over the table staring blankly
But presently her halfaverted face began to haunt me as she had sat at the table and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder
III The next day I did an unexampled thing
I sent a telegram to my uncle Bad temper not coming to business and set off for Highgate and Ewart
He was actually at workon a bust of Millie and seemed very glad for any interruption
Ewart you old Fool I said knock off and come for a days gossip
Im rotten
Theres a sympathetic sort of lunacy about you
Lets go to Staines and paddle up to Windsor
Girl
said Ewart putting down a chisel
Yes
That was all I told him of my affair
Ive got no money he remarked to clear up ambiguity in my invitation
We got a jar of shandygaff some food and on Ewarts suggestion two Japanese sunshades in Staines we demanded extra cushions at the boathouse and we spent an enormously soothing day in discourse and meditation our boat moored in a shady place this side of Windsor
I seem to remember Ewart with a cushion forward only his heels and sunshade and some black ends of hair showing a voice and no more against the shining smoothlystreaming mirror of the trees and bushes
Its not worth it was the burthen of the voice
Youd better get yourself a Millie Ponderevo and then you wouldnt feel so upset
No I said decidedly thats not my way
A thread of smoke ascended from Ewart for a while like smoke from an altar
Everythings a muddle and you think it isnt
Nobody knows where we arebecause as a matter of fact we arent anywhere
Are women propertyor are they fellowcreatures
Or a sort of proprietary goddesses
Theyre so obviously fellowcreatures
You believe in the goddess
No I said thats not my idea
What is your idea
Well Hm said Ewart in my pause
My idea I said is to meet one person who will belong to meto whom I shall belongbody and soul
No halfgods
Wait till she comes
If she comes at all We must come to each other young and pure
Theres no such thing as a pure person or an impure person Mixed to begin with
This was so manifestly true that it silenced me altogether
And if you belong to her and she to you Ponderevowhich ends the head
I made no answer except an impatient oh
For a time we smoked in silence Did I tell you Ponderevo of a wonderful discovery Ive made
Ewart began presently
No I said what is it
Theres no Mrs
Grundy
No
No
Practically not
Ive just thought all that business out
Shes merely an instrument Ponderevo
Shes borne the blame
Grundys a man
Grundy unmasked
Rather lean and out of sorts
Early middle age
With bunchy black whiskers and a worried eye
Been good so far and its fretting him
Moods
Theres Grundy in a state of sexual panic for exampleFor Gods sake cover it up
They get togetherthey get together
Its too exciting
The most dreadful things are happening
Rushing aboutlong arms going like a windmill
They must be kept apart
Starts out for an absolute obliteration of everything absolute separations
One side of the road for men and the other for women and a hoardingwithout posters between them
Every boy and girl to be sewed up in a sack and sealed just the head and hands and feet out until twentyone
Music abolished calico garments for the lower animals
Sparrows to be suppressedabsolutely
I laughed abruptly
Well thats Mr Grundy in one moodand it puts Mrs GrundyShes a muchmaligned person Ponderevoa rake at heartand it puts her in a most painful state of flustermost painful
Shes an amenable creature
When Grundy tells her things are shocking shes shockedpink and breathless
She goes about trying to conceal her profound sense of guilt behind a haughty expression Grundy meanwhile is in a state of complete whirlabout
Long lean knuckly hands pointing and gesticulating
Theyre still thinking of thingsthinking of things
Its dreadful
They get it out of books
I cant imagine where they get it
I must watch
Therere people over there whispering
Nobody ought to whisperTheres something suggestive in the mere act
Then pictures
In the museumthings too dreadful for words
Why cant we have pure artwith the anatomy all wrong and pure and niceand pure fiction pure poetry instead of all this stuff with allusionsallusions
Excuse me
Theres something up behind that locked door
The keyhole
In the interests of public moralityyes Sir as a pure good manI insistILL lookit wont hurt meI insist on looking my dutyMmmthe keyhole
He kicked his legs about extravagantly and I laughed again
Thats Grundy in one mood Ponderevo
It isnt Mrs Grundy
Thats one of the lies we tell about women
Theyre too simple
Simple
Woman ARE simple
They take on just what men tell em
Ewart meditated for a space
Just exactly as its put to them he said and resumed the moods of Mr Grundy
Then you get old Grundy in another mood
Ever caught him nosing Ponderevo
Mad with the idea of mysterious unknown wicked delicious things
Things that arent respectable
Wow
Things he mustnt do
Any one who knows about these things knows theres just as much mystery and deliciousness about Grundys forbidden things as there is about eating ham
Jolly nice if its a bright morning and youre well and hungry and having breakfast in the open air
Jolly unattractive if youre off colour
But Grundys covered it all up and hidden it and put mucky shades and covers over it until hes forgotten it
Begins to fester round it in his mind
Has dreadful struggleswith himself about impure thoughts Then you set Grundy with hot earscurious in undertones
Grundy on the loose Grundy in a hoarse whisper and with furtive eyes and convulsive movementsmaking things indecent
Evolvingin dense vapoursindecency
Grundy sins
Oh yes hes a hypocrite
Sneaks round a corner and sins ugly
Its Grundy and his dark corners that make vice vice
We artistswe have no vices
And then hes frantic with repentance
And wants to be cruel to fallen women and decent harmless sculptors of the simple nudelike meand so back to his panic again
Mrs Grundy I suppose doesnt know he sins I remarked
No
Im not so sure
But bless her heart shes a woman Shes a woman
Then again you get Grundy with a large greasy smilelike an accident to a butter tuball over his face being Liberal MindedGrundy in his AntiPuritan moments trying not to see Harm in itGrundy the friend of innocent pleasure
He makes you sick with the Harm hes trying not to see in it And thats why everythings wrong Ponderevo
Grundy damn him
stands in the light and we young people cant see
His moods affect us
We catch his gusts of panic his disease of nosing his greasiness
We dont know what we may think what we may say he does his silly utmost to prevent our reading and seeing the one thing the one sort of discussion we findquite naturally and properlysupremely interesting
So we dont adolescence we blunder up to sex
Daredare to lookand he may dirt you for ever
The girls are terrorstricken to silence by his significant whiskers by the bleary something in his eyes
Suddenly Ewart with an almost Jackinthebox effect sat up
Hes about us everywhere Ponderevo he said very solemnly
Sometimessometimes I think he isin our blood
In MINE
He regarded me for my opinion very earnestly with his pipe in the corner of his mouth
Youre the remotest cousin he ever had I said
I reflected
Look here Ewart I asked how would you have things different
He wrinkled up his queer face regarded the wait and made his pipe gurgle for a space thinking deeply
There are complications I admit
Weve grown up under the terror of Grundy and that innocent but docile andyesformidable lady his wife
I dont know how far the complications arent a disease a sort of bleaching under the Grundy shadow
It is possible there are things I have still to learn about women Man has eaten of the Tree of Knowledge
His innocence is gone
You cant have your cake and eat it
Were in for knowledge lets have it plain and straight
I should begin I think by abolishing the ideas of decency and indecency Grundy would have fits
I injected
Grundy Ponderevo would have cold douchespubliclyif the sight was not too painfulthree times a day
But I dont think mind you that I should let the sexes run about together
No
The fact behind the sexesis sex
Its no good humbugging
It trails abouteven in the best mixed company
Tugs at your ankle
The men get showing off and quarrellingand the women
Or theyre bored
I suppose the ancestral males have competed for the ancestral females ever since they were both some sort of grubby little reptile
You arent going to alter that in a thousand years or so Never should you have a mixed company neverexcept with only one man or only one woman
How would that be
Or duets only
How to manage it
Some rule of etiquette perhaps
He became portentously grave
Then his long hand went out in weird gestures
I seem to seeI seem to seea sort of City of Women Ponderevo
Yes A walled enclosuregood stonemasons worka city wall high as the walls of Rome going about a garden
Dozens of square miles of gardentreesfountains arbourslakes
Lawns on which the women play avenues in which they gossip boats Women like that sort of thing
Any woman whos been to a good eventful girls school lives on the memory of it for the rest of her life
Its one of the pathetic things about womenthe superiority of school and collegeto anything they get afterwards
And this citygarden of women will have beautiful places for music places for beautiful dresses places for beautiful work
Everything a woman can want
Nurseries
Kindergartens
Schools
And no manexcept to do rough work perhapsever comes in
The men live in a world where they can hunt and engineer invent and mine and manufacture sail ships drink deep and practice the arts and fight Yes I said but He stilled me with a gesture
Im coming to that
The homes of the women Ponderevo will be set in the wall of their city each woman will have her own particular house and home furnished after her own heart in her own mannerwith a little balcony on the outside wall
Built into the walland a little balcony
And there she will go and look out when the mood takes her and all round the city there will be a broad road and seats and great shady trees
And men will stroll up and down there when they feel the need of feminine company when for instance they want to talk about their souls or their characters or any of the things that only women will stand
The women will lean over and look at the men and smile and talk to them as they fancy
And each woman will have this she will have a little silken ladder she can let down if she choosesif she wants to talk closer The men would still be competing
There perhapsyes
But theyd have to abide by the womens decisions
I raised one or two difficulties and for a while we played with this idea
Ewart I said this is like Dolls Island
Suppose I reflected an unsuccessful man laid siege to a balcony and wouldnt let his rival come near it
Move him on said Ewart by a special regulation
As one does organgrinders
No difficulty about that
And you could forbid itmake it against the etiquette
No life is decent without etiquette And people obey etiquette sooner than laws Hm I said and was struck by an idea that is remote in the world of a young man
How about children
I asked in the City
Girls are all very well
But boys for examplegrow up
Ah
said Ewart
Yes
I forgot
They mustnt grow up inside
Theyd turn out the boys when they were seven
The father must come with a little pony and a little gun and manly wear and take the boy away
Then one could come afterwards to ones mothers balcony
It must be fine to have a mother
The father and the son This is all very pretty in its way I said at last but its a dream
Lets come back to reality
What I want to know is what are you going to do in Brompton let us say or Walham Green NOW
Oh
damn it
he remarked Walham Green
What a chap you are Ponderevo
and he made an abrupt end to his discourse
He wouldnt even reply to my tentatives for a time
While I was talking just now he remarked presently I had a quite different idea
What
For a masterpiece
A series
Like the busts of the Caesars
Only not heads you know
We dont see the people who do things to us nowadays How will you do it then
Handsa series of hands
The hands of the Twentieth Century
Ill do it
Some day some one will discover itgo theresee what I have done and what is meant by it
See it where
On the tombs
Why not
The Unknown Master of the Highgate Slope
All the little soft feminine hands the nervous ugly males the hands of the flops and the hands of the snatchers
And Grundys loose lean knuckly affairGrundy the terrorthe little wrinkles and the thumb
Only it ought to hold all the others togetherin a slightly disturbing squeezeLike Rodins great Handyou know the thing
IV I forget how many days intervened between that last breaking off of our engagement and Marions surrender
But I recall now the sharpness of my emotion the concentrated spirit of tears and laughter in my throat as I read the words of her unexpected letterI have thought over everything and I was selfish I rushed off to Walham Green that evening to give back all she had given me to beat her altogether at giving
She was extraordinarily gentle and generous that time I remember and when at last I left her she kissed me very sweetly
So we were married
We were married with all the customary incongruity
I gaveperhaps after a while not altogether ungrudginglyand what I gave Marion took with a manifest satisfaction
After all I was being sensible
So that we had three livery carriages to the church one of the pairs of horses matched and coachmenwith improvised flavour and very shabby silk hatsbearing white favours on their whips and my uncle intervened with splendour and insisted upon having a wedding breakfast sent in from a caterers in Hammersmith
The table had a great display of chrysanthemums and there was orange blossom in the significant place and a wonderful cake
We also circulated upwards of a score of wedges of that accompanied by silverprinted cards in which Marions name of Ramboat was stricken out by an arrow in favour of Ponderevo
We had a little rally of Marions relations and several friends and friends friends from Smithies appeared in the church and drifted vestryward
I produced my aunt and uncle a select group of two
The effect in that shabby little house was one of exhilarating congestion
The sideboard in which lived the tablecloth and the Apartments card was used for a display of the presents eked out by the unused balance of the silverprinted cards
Marion wore the white raiment of a bride white silk and satin that did not suit her that made her seem large and strange to me she obtruded bows and unfamiliar contours
She went through all this strange ritual of an English wedding with a sacramental gravity that I was altogether too young and egotistical to comprehend
It was all extraordinarily central and important to her it was no more than an offensive complicated and disconcerting intrusion of a world I was already beginning to criticise very bitterly to me
What was all this fuss for
The mere indecent advertisement that I had been passionately in love with Marion
I think however that Marion was only very remotely aware of my smouldering exasperation at having in the end behaved nicely
I had playedup to the extent of dressing my part I had an admirably cut frockcoat a new silk hat trousers as light as I could endure themlighter in facta white waistcoat night tie light gloves
Marion seeing me despondent had the unusual enterprise to whisper to me that I looked lovely I knew too well I didnt look myself
I looked like a special coloured supplement to Mens Wear or The Tailor and Cutter Full Dress For Ceremonial Occasions
I had even the disconcerting sensations of an unfamiliar collar
I felt lostin a strange body and when I glanced down myself for reassurance the straight white abdomen the alien legs confirmed that impression
My uncle was my best man and looked like a bankera little bankerin flower
He wore a white rose in his buttonhole
He wasnt I think particularly talkative
At least I recall very little from him
George he said once or twice this is a great occasion for youa very great occasion
He spoke a little doubtfully
You see I had told him nothing about Marion until about a week before the wedding both he and my aunt had been taken altogether by surprise
They couldnt as people say make it out
My aunt was intensely interested much more than my uncle it was then I think for the first time that I really saw that she cared for me
She got me alone I remember after I had made my announcement
Now George she said tell me everything about her
Why didnt you tellME at leastbefore
I was surprised to find how difficult it was to tell her about Marion
I perplexed her
Then is she beautiful
she asked at last
I dont know what youll think of her I parried
I think Yes
I think she might be the most beautiful person in the world
And isnt she
To you
Of course I said nodding my head
Yes
She IS And while I dont remember anything my uncle said or did at the wedding I do remember very distinctly certain little things scrutiny solicitude a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunts eyes
It dawned on me that I wasnt hiding anything from her at all
She was dressed very smartly wearing a bigplumed hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever and when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and her eye all on Marion perplexed into selfforgetfulness it wasnt somehow funny
She was I do believe giving my marriage more thought than I had done she was concerned beyond measure at my black rage and Marions blindness she was looking with eyes that knew what loving isfor love
In the vestry she turned away as we signed and I verily believe she was crying though to this day I cant say why she should have cried and she was near crying too when she squeezed my hand at partingand she never said a word or looked at me but just squeezed my hand
If I had not been so grim in spirit I think I should have found much of my wedding amusing
I remember a lot of ridiculous detail that still declines to be funny in my memory
The officiating clergyman had a cold and turned his ns to ds and he made the most mechanical compliment conceivable about the brides age when the register was signed
Every bride he had ever married had had it one knew
And two middleaged spinsters cousins of Marions and dressmakers at Barking stand out
They wore marvellously bright and gay blouses and dim old skirts and had an immense respect for Mr Ramboat
They threw rice they brought a whole bag with them and gave handfuls away to unknown little boys at the church door and so created a Lilliputian riot and one had meant to throw a slipper
It was a very warm old silk slipper I know because she dropped it out of a pocket in the aislethere was a sort of jumble in the aisleand I picked it up for her
I dont think she actually threw it for as we drove away from the church I saw her in a dreadful and it seemed to me hopeless struggle with her pocket and afterwards my eye caught the missile of good fortune lying it or its fellow most obviously mislaid behind the umbrellastand in the hall
The whole business was much more absurd more incoherent more human than I had anticipated but I was far too young and serious to let the latter quality atone for its shortcomings
I am so remote from this phase of my youth that I can look back at it all as dispassionately as one looks at a pictureat some wonderful perfect sort of picture that is inexhaustible but at the time these things filled me with unspeakable resentment
Now I go round it all look into its details generalise about its aspects
Im interested for example to square it with my Bladesover theory of the British social scheme
Under stress of tradition we were all of us trying in the fermenting chaos of London to carry out the marriage ceremonies of a Bladesover tenant or one of the chubby middling sort of people in some dependent country town
There a marriage is a public function with a public significance
There the church is to a large extent the gatheringplace of the community and your going to be married a thing of importance to every one you pass on the road
It is a change of status that quite legitimately interests the whole neighbourhood
But in London there are no neighbours nobody knows nobody cares
An absolute stranger in an office took my notice and our banns were proclaimed to ears that had never previously heard our names
The clergyman even who married us had never seen us before and didnt in any degree intimate that he wanted to see us again
Neighbours in London
The Ramboats did not know the names of the people on either side of them
As I waited for Marion before we started off upon our honeymoon flight Mr Ramboat I remember came and stood beside me and stared out of the window
There was a funeral over there yesterday he said by way of making conversation and moved his head at the house opposite
Quite a smart affair it was with a glass earse And our little procession of three carriages with whitefavouradorned horses and drivers went through all the huge noisy indifferent traffic like a lost china image in the coalchute of an ironclad
Nobody made way for us nobody cared for us the driver of an omnibus jeered for a long time we crawled behind an unamiable dustcart
The irrelevant clatter and tumult gave a queer flavour of indecency to this public coming together of lovers
We seemed to have obtruded ourselves shamelessly
The crowd that gathered outside the church would have gathered in the same spirit and with greater alacrity for a street accident At Charing Crosswe were going to Hastingsthe experienced eye of the guard detected the significance of our unusual costume and he secured us a compartment
Well said I as the train moved out of the station Thats all over
And I turned to Mariona little unfamiliar still in her unfamiliar clothesand smiled
She regarded me gravely timidly
Youre not cross
she asked
Cross
Why
At having it all proper
My dear Marion
said I and by way of answer took and kissed her whitegloved leatherscented hand
I dont remember much else about the journey an hour or so it was of undistinguished timefor we were both confused and a little fatigued and Marion had a slight headache and did not want caresses
I fell into a reverie about my aunt and realised as if it were a new discovery that I cared for her very greatly
I was acutely sorry I had not told her earlier of my marriage
But you will not want to hear the history of my honeymoon
I have told all that was needed to serve my present purpose
Thus and thus it was the Will in things had its way with me
Driven by forces I did not understand diverted altogether from the science the curiosities and work to which I had once given myself I fought my way through a tangle of traditions customs obstacles and absurdities enraged myself limited myself gave myself to occupations I saw with the clearest vision were dishonourable and vain and at last achieved the end of purblind Nature the relentless immediacy of her desire and held far short of happiness Marion weeping and reluctant in my arms
V Who can tell the story of the slow estrangement of two married people the weakening of first this bond and then that of that complex contact
Least of all can one of the two participants
Even now with an interval of fifteen years to clear it up for me I still find a mass of impressions of Marion as confused as discordant as unsystematic and selfcontradictory as life
I think of this thing and love her of that and hate herof a hundred aspects in which I can now see her with an unimpassioned sympathy
As I sit here trying to render some vision of this infinitely confused process I recall moments of hard and fierce estrangement moments of clouded intimacy the passage of transition all forgotten
We talked a little language together whence were friends and I was Mutney and she was Ming and we kept up such an outward show that till the very end Smithie thought our household the most amiable in the world
I cannot tell to the full how Marion thwarted me and failed in that life of intimate emotions which is the kernel of love
That life of intimate emotions is made up of little things
A beautiful face differs from an ugly one by a difference of surfaces and proportions that are sometimes almost infinitesimally small
I find myself setting down little things and little things none of them do more than demonstrate those essential temperamental discords I have already sought to make clear
Some readers will understandto others I shall seem no more than an unfeeling brute who couldnt make allowances
Its easy to make allowances now but to be young and ardent and to make allowances to see ones married life open before one the life that seemed in its dawn a glory a garden of roses a place of deep sweet mysteries and heart throbs and wonderful silences and to see it a vista of tolerations and babytalk a compromise the least effectual thing in all ones life
Every love romance I read seemed to mock our dull intercourse every poem every beautiful picture reflected upon the uneventful succession of grey hours we had together
I think our real difference was one of aesthetic sensibility
I do still recall as the worst and most disastrous aspect of all that time her absolute disregard of her own beauty
Its the pettiest thing to record I know but she could wear curlpapers in my presence
It was her idea too to wear out her old clothes and her failures at home when no one was likely to see herno one being myself
She allowed me to accumulate a store of ungracious and slovenly memories All our conceptions of life differed
I remember how we differed about furniture
We spent three or four days in Tottenham Court Road and she chose the things she fancied with an inexorable resolutionsweeping aside my suggestions withOh YOU want such queer things
She pursued some limited clearly seen and experienced idealthat excluded all other possibilities
Over every mantel was a mirror that was draped our sideboard was wonderfully good and splendid with beveled glass we had lamps on long metal stalks and cozy corners and plants in grogtubs
Smithie approved it all
There wasnt a place where one could sit and read in the whole house
My books went upon shelves in the diningroom recess
And we had a piano though Marions playing was at an elementary level
You know it was the cruelest luck for Marion that I with my restlessness my scepticism my constantly developing ideas had insisted on marriage with her
She had no faculty of growth or change she had taken her mould she had set in the limited ideas of her peculiar class
She preserved her conception of what was right in drawingroom chairs and in marriage ceremonial and in every relation of life with a simple and luminous honesty and conviction with an immense unimaginative inflexibilityas a tailorbird builds its nest or a beaver makes its dam
Let me hasten over this history of disappointments and separation
I might tell of waxings and waning of love between us but the whole was waning
Sometimes she would do things for me make me a tie or a pair of slippers and fill me with none the less gratitude because the things were absurd
She ran our home and our one servant with a hard bright efficiency
She was inordinately proud of house and garden
Always by her lights she did her duty by me
Presently the rapid development of TonoBungay began to take me into the provinces and I would be away sometimes for a week together
This she did not like it left her dull she said but after a time she began to go to Smithies again and to develop an independence of me
At Smithies she was now a woman with a position she had money to spend
She would take Smithie to theatres and out to lunch and talk interminably of the business and Smithie became a sort of permanent weekender with us
Also Marion got a spaniel and began to dabble with the minor arts with pokerwork and a Kodak and hyacinths in glasses
She called once on a neighbour
Her parents left Walham Greenher father severed his connection with the gasworksand came to live in a small house I took for them near us and they were much with us
Odd the littleness of the things that exasperate when the fountains of life are embittered
My fatherinlaw was perpetually catching me in moody moments and urging me to take to gardening
He irritated me beyond measure
You think too much he would say
If you was to let in a bit with a spade you might soon ave that garden of yours a Vision of Flowers
Thats better than thinking George
Or in a torrent of exasperation I CARNT think George why you dont get a bit of glass ere
This sunny corner you cd do wonders with a bit of glass
And in the summer time he never came in without performing a sort of conjuring trick in the hall and taking cucumbers and tomatoes from unexpected points of his person
All out o MY little bit hed say in exemplary tones
He left a trail of vegetable produce in the most unusual places on mantel boards sideboards the tops of pictures
Heavens
how the sudden unexpected tomato could annoy me
It did much to widen our estrangement that Marion and my aunt failed to make friends became by a sort of instinct antagonistic
My aunt to begin with called rather frequently for she was really anxious to know Marion
At first she would arrive like a whirlwind and pervade the house with an atmosphere of hello
She dressed already with that cheerfully extravagant abandon that signalised her accession to fortune and dressed her best for these visits
She wanted to play the mother to me I fancy to tell Marion occult secrets about the way I wore out my boots and how I never could think to put on thicker things in cold weather
But Marion received her with that defensive suspiciousness of the shy person thinking only of the possible criticism of herself and my aunt perceiving this became nervous and slangy She says such queer things said Marion once discussing her
But I suppose its witty
Yes I said it IS witty
If I said things like she does The queer things my aunt said were nothing to the queer things she didnt say
I remember her in our drawingroom one day and how she cocked her eyeits the only expressionat the Indiarubber plant in a Doultonware pot which Marion had placed on the corner of the piano
She was on the very verge of speech
Then suddenly she caught my expression and shrank up like a cat that has been discovered looking at the milk
Then a wicked impulse took her
Didnt say an old word George she insisted looking me full in the eye
I smiled
Youre a dear I said not to as Marion came lowering into the room to welcome her
But I felt extraordinarily like a traitorto the Indiarubber plant I supposefor all that nothing had been said Your aunt makes Game of people was Marions verdict and openmindedly I suppose its all right for her
Several times we went to the house in Beckenham for lunch and once or twice to dinner
My aunt did her peculiar best to be friends but Marion was implacable
She was also I know intensely uncomfortable and she adopted as her social method an exhausting silence replying compactly and without giving openings to anything that was said to her
The gaps between my aunts visits grew wider and wider
My married existence became at last like a narrow deep groove in the broad expanse of interests in which I was living
I went about the world I met a great number of varied personalities I read endless books in trains as I went to and fro
I developed social relationships at my uncles house that Marion did not share
The seeds of new ideas poured in upon me and grew in me
Those early and middle years of ones third decade are I suppose for a man the years of greatest mental growth
They are restless years and full of vague enterprise
Each time I returned to Ealing life there seemed more alien narrow and unattractiveand Marion less beautiful and more limited and difficultuntil at last she was robbed of every particle of her magic
She gave me always a cooler welcome I think until she seemed entirely apathetic
I never asked myself then what heartaches she might hide or what her discontents might be
I would come home hoping nothing expecting nothing
This was my fated life and I had chosen it
I became more sensitive to the defects I had once disregarded altogether I began to associate her sallow complexion with her temperamental insufficiency and the heavier lines of her mouth and nostril with her moods of discontent
We drifted apart wider and wider the gap opened
I tired of babytalk and stereotyped little fondlings I tired of the latest intelligence from those wonderful workrooms and showed it all too plainly we hardly spoke when we were alone together
The mere unreciprocated physical residue of my passion remainedan exasperation between us
No children came to save us
Marion had acquired at Smithies a disgust and dread of maternity
All that was the fruition and quintessence of the horrid elements in life a disgusting thing a last indignity that overtook unwary women
I doubt indeed a little if children would have saved us we should have differed so fatally about their upbringing
Altogether I remember my life with Marion as a long distress now hard now tender
It was in those days that I first became critical of my life and burdened with a sense of error and maladjustment
I would lie awake in the night asking myself the purpose of things reviewing my unsatisfying ungainly homelife my days spent in rascal enterprise and rubbishselling contrasting all I was being and doing with my adolescent ambitions my Wimblehurst dreams
My circumstances had an air of finality and I asked myself in vain why I had forced myself into them
VI The end of our intolerable situation came suddenly and unexpectedly but in a way that I suppose was almost inevitable
My alienated affections wandered and I was unfaithful to Marion
I wont pretend to extenuate the quality of my conduct
I was a young and fairly vigorous male all my appetite for love had been roused and whetted and none of it had been satisfied by my love affair and my marriage
I had pursued an elusive gleam of beauty to the disregard of all else and it had failed me
It had faded when I had hoped it would grow brighter
I despaired of life and was embittered
And things happened as I am telling
I dont draw any moral at all in the matter and as for social remedies I leave them to the social reformer
Ive got to a time of life when the only theories that interest me are generalisations about realities
To go to our inner office in Raggett Street I had to walk through a room in which the typists worked
They were the correspondence typists our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure on either side of us
I was I must confess always in a faintly cloudilyemotional way aware of that collection of for the most part roundshouldered femininity but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention
I appreciated her at first as a straight little back a neater back than any of the others as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls as chestnut hair very neatly doneand as a sidelong glance presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me
My eye would seek her as I went through on business thingsI dictated some letters to her and so discovered she had pretty softlooking hands with pink nails
Once or twice meeting casually we looked one another for the flash of a second in the eyes
That was all
But it was enough in the mysterious freemasonry of sex to say essential things
We had a secret between us
One day I came into Raggett Street at lunch time and she was alone sitting at her desk
She glanced up as I entered and then became very still with a downcast face and her hands clenched on the table
I walked right by her to the door of the inner office stopped came back and stood over her
We neither of us spoke for quite a perceptible time
I was trembling violently
Is that one of the new typewriters
I asked at last for the sake of speaking
She looked up at me without a word with her face flushed and her eyes alight and I bent down and kissed her lips
She leant back to put an arm about me drew my face to her and kissed me again and again
I lifted her and held her in my arms
She gave a little smothered cry to feel herself so held
Never before had I known the quality of passionate kisses
Somebody became audible in the shop outside
We started back from one another with flushed faces and bright and burning eyes
We cant talk here I whispered with a confident intimacy
Where do you go at five
Along the Embankment to Charing Cross she answered as intimately
None of the others go that way About halfpast five
Yes halfpast five The door from the shop opened and she sat down very quickly
Im glad I said in a commonplace voice that these new typewriters are all right
I went into the inner office and routed out the paysheet in order to find her nameEffie Rink
And did no work at all that afternoon
I fretted about that dingy little den like a beast in a cage
When presently I went out Effie was working with an extraordinary appearance of calmand there was no look for me at all We met and had our talk that evening a talk in whispers when there was none to overhear we came to an understanding
It was strangely unlike any dream of romance I had ever entertained
VII I came back after a weeks absence to my home againa changed man
I had lived out my first rush of passion for Effie had come to a contemplation of my position
I had gauged Effies place in the scheme of things and parted from her for a time
She was back in her place at Raggett Street after a temporary indisposition
I did not feel in any way penitent or ashamed I know as I opened the little castiron gate that kept Marions front grader and Pampas Grass from the wandering dog
Indeed if anything I felt as if I had vindicated some right that had been in question
I came back to Marion with no sense of wrongdoing at all with indeed a new friendliness towards her
I dont know how it may be proper to feel on such occasions that is how I felt
I followed her in our drawingroom standing beside the tall lampstand that half filled the bay as though she had just turned from watching for me at the window
There was something in her pale face that arrested me
She looked as if she had not been sleeping
She did not come forward to greet me
Youve come home she said
As I wrote to you
She stood very still a dusky figure against the bright window
Where have you been
she asked
East Coast I said easily
She paused for a moment
I KNOW she said
I stared at her
It was the most amazing moment in any life By Jove
I said at last I believe you do
And then you come home to me
I walked to the hearthrug and stood quite still there regarding this new situation
I didnt dream she began
How could you do such a thing
It seemed a long interval before either of us spoke another word
Who knows about it
I asked at last
Smithies brother
They were at Cromer
Confound Cromer
Yes
How could you bring yourself I felt a spasm of petulant annoyance at this unexpected catastrophe
I should like to wring Smithies brothers neck I said Marion spoke in dry broken fragments of sentences
You
Id always thought that anyhow you couldnt deceive me
I suppose all men are horridabout this
It doesnt strike me as horrid
It seems to me the most necessary consequenceand natural thing in the world
I became aware of some one moving about in the passage and went and shut the door of the room then I walked back to the hearthrug and turned
Its rough on you I said
But I didnt mean you to know
Youve never cared for me
Ive had the devil of a time
Why should you mind
She sat down in a draped armchair
I HAVE cared for you she said
I shrugged my shoulders
I suppose she said SHE cares for you
I had no answer
Where is she now
Oh
does it matter to you
Look here Marion
Thisthis I didnt anticipate
I didnt mean this thing to smash down on you like this
But you know something had to happen
Im sorrysorry to the bottom of my heart that things have come to this between us
But indeed Im taken by surprise
I dont know where I amI dont know how we got here
Things took me by surprise
I found myself alone with her one day
I kissed her
I went on
It seemed stupid to go back
And besideswhy should I have gone back
Why should I
From first to last Ive hardly thought of it as touching you
Damn
She scrutinised my face and pulled at the ballfringe of the little table beside her
To think of it she said
I dont believe I can ever touch you again
We kept a long silence
I was only beginning to realise in the most superficial way the immense catastrophe that had happened between us
Enormous issues had rushed upon us
I felt unprepared and altogether inadequate
I was unreasonably angry
There came a rush of stupid expressions to my mind that my rising sense of the supreme importance of the moment saved me from saying
The gap of silence widened until it threatened to become the vast memorable margin of some one among a thousand trivial possibilities of speech that would vex our relations for ever
Our little general servant tapped at the doorMarion always liked the servant to tapand appeared
Tea Mm she saidand vanished leaving the door open
I will go upstairs said I and stopped
I will go upstairs I repeated and put my bag in the spare room
We remained motionless and silent for a few seconds
Mother is having tea with us today Marion remarked at last and dropped the worried end of ballfringe and stood up slowly And so with this immense discussion of our changed relations hanging over us we presently had tea with the unsuspecting Mrs Ramboat and the spaniel
Mrs Ramboat was too well trained in her position to remark upon our somber preoccupation
She kept a thin trickle of talk going and told us I remember that Mr Ramboat was troubled about his cannas
They dont come up and they wont come up
Hes been round and had an explanation with the man who sold him the bulbsand hes very heated and upset
The spaniel was a great bore begging and doing small tricks first at one and then at the other of us
Neither of us used his name
You see we had called him Miggles and made a sort of trio in the babytalk of Mutney and Miggles and Ming
VIII Then presently we resumed our monstrous momentous dialogue
I cant now make out how long that dialogue went on
It spread itself I know in heavy fragments over either three days or four
I remember myself grouped with Marion talking sitting on our bed in her room talking standing in our diningroom saving this thing or that
Twice we went for long walks
And we had a long evening alone together with jaded nerves and hearts that fluctuated between a hard and dreary recognition of facts and on my part at least a strange unwonted tenderness because in some extraordinary way this crisis had destroyed our mutual apathy and made us feel one another again
It was a dialogue that had discrepant parts that fell into lumps of talk that failed to join on to their predecessors that began again at a different level higher or lower that assumed new aspects in the intervals and assimilated new considerations
We discussed the fact that we two were no longer lovers never before had we faced that
It seems a strange thing to write but as I look back I see clearly that those several days were the time when Marion and I were closest together looked for the first and last time faithfully and steadfastly into each others soul
For those days only there were no pretences I made no concessions to her nor she to me we concealed nothing exaggerated nothing
We had done with pretending
We had it out plainly and soberly with each other
Mood followed mood and got its stark expression
Of course there was quarreling between us bitter quarreling and we said things to one anotherlong pentup things that bruised and crushed and cut
But over it all in my memory now is an effect of deliberate confrontation and the figure of Marion stands up pale melancholy tearstained injured implacable and dignified
You love her
she asked once and jerked that doubt into my mind
I struggled with tangled ideas and emotions
I dont know what love is
Its all sorts of thingsits made of a dozen strands twisted in a thousand ways
But you want her
You want her nowwhen you think of her
Yes I reflected
I want herright enough
And me
Where do I come in
I suppose you come in here
Well but what are you going to do
Do
I said with the exasperation of the situation growing upon me
What do you want me to do
As I look back upon all that timeacross a gulf of fifteen active yearsI find I see it with an understanding judgment
I see it as if it were the business of some one elseindeed of two other peopleintimately known yet judged without passion
I see now that this shock this sudden immense disillusionment did in real fact bring out a mind and soul in Marion that for the first time she emerged from habits timidities imitations phrases and a certain narrow willimpulse and became a personality
Her ruling motive at first was I think an indignant and outraged pride
This situation must end
She asked me categorically to give up Effie and I full of fresh and glowing memories absolutely refused
Its too late Marion I said
It cant be done like that
Then we cant very well go on living together she said
Can we
Very well I deliberated if you must have it so
Well can we
Can you stay in this house
I meanif I go away
I dont know
I dont think I could
Thenwhat do you want
Slowly we worked our way from point to point until at last the word divorce was before us
If we cant live together we ought to be free said Marion
I dont know anything of divorce I saidif you mean that
I dont know how it is done
I shall have to ask somebodyor look it up Perhaps after all it is the thing to do
We may as well face it
We began to talk ourselves into a realisation of what our divergent futures might be
I came back on the evening of that day with my questions answered by a solicitor
We cant as a matter of fact I said get divorced as things are
Apparently so far as the law goes youve got to stand this sort of thing
Its silly but that is the law
However its easy to arrange a divorce
In addition to adultery there must be desertion or cruelty
To establish cruelty I should have to strike you or something of that sort before witnesses
Thats impossiblebut its simple to desert you legally
I have to go away from you thats all
I can go on sending you moneyand you bring a suit what is itfor Restitution of Conjugal Rights
The Court orders me to return
I disobey
Then you can go on to divorce me
You get a Decree Nisi and once more the Court tries to make me come back
If we dont make it up within six months and if you dont behave scandalously the Decree is made absolute
Thats the end of the fuss
Thats how one gets unmarried
Its easier you see to marry than unmarry
And thenhow do I live
What becomes of me
Youll have an income
They call it alimony
From a third to a half of my present incomemore if you likeI dont mindthree hundred a year say
Youve got your old people to keep and youll need all that
And thenthen youll be free
Both of us
And all this life youve hated I looked up at her wrung and bitter face
I havent hated it I lied my voice near breaking with the pain of it all
Have you
IX The perplexing thing about life is the irresolvable complexity of reality of things and relations alike
Nothing is simple
Every wrong done has a certain justice in it and every good deed has dregs of evil
As for us young still and still without selfknowledge resounded a hundred discordant notes in the harsh angle of that shock
We were furiously angry with each other tender with each other callously selfish generously selfsacrificing
I remember Marion saying innumerable detached things that didnt hang together one with another that contradicted one another that were nevertheless all in their places profoundly true and sincere
I see them now as so many vain experiments in her effort to apprehend the crumpled confusions of our complex moral landslide
Some I found irritating beyond measure
I answered hersometimes quite abominably
Of course she would say again and again my life has been a failure
Ive besieged you for three years I would retort asking it not to be
Youve done as you pleased
If Ive turned away at last Or again she would revive all the stresses before our marriage
How you must hate me
I made you wait
Well nowI suppose you have your revenge
REVENGE
I echoed
Then she would try over the aspects of our new separated lives
I ought to earn my own living she would insist
I want to be quite independent
Ive always hated London
Perhaps I shall try a poultry farm and bees
You wont mind at first my being a burden
Afterwards Weve settled all that I said
I suppose you will hate me anyhow There were times when she seemed to regard our separation with absolute complacency when she would plan all sorts of freedoms and characteristic interests
I shall go out a lot with Smithie she said
And once she said an ugly thing that I did indeed hate her for
that I cannot even now quite forgive her
Your aunt will rejoice at all this
She never cared for me Into my memory of these pains and stresses comes the figure of Smithie fullcharged with emotion so breathless in the presence of the horrid villain of the piece that she could make no articulate sounds
She had long tearful confidences with Marion I know sympathetic close clingings
There were moments when only absolute speechlessness prevented her giving me a stupendous talkingtoI could see it in her eye
The wrong things she would have said
And I recall too Mrs Ramboats slow awakening to something in the air the growing expression of solicitude in her eye only her welltrained fear of Marion keeping her from speech
And at last through all this welter like a thing fated and altogether beyond our control parting came to Marion and me
I hardened my heart or I could not have gone
For at the last it came to Marion that she was parting from me for ever
That overbore all other things had turned our last hour to anguish
She forgot for a time the prospect of moving into a new house she forgot the outrage on her proprietorship and pride
For the first time in her life she really showed strong emotions in regard to me for the first time perhaps they really came to her
She began to weep slow reluctant tears
I came into her room and found her asprawl on the bed weeping
I didnt know she cried
Oh
I didnt understand
Ive been a fool
All my life is a wreck
I shall be aloneMUTNEY
Mutney dont leave me
Oh
Mutney
I didnt understand
I had to harden my heart indeed for it seemed to me at moments in those last hours together that at last too late the longedfor thing had happened and Marion had come alive
A newborn hunger for me lit her eyes
Dont leave me
she said dont leave me
She clung to me she kissed me with tearsalt lips
I was promised now and pledged and I hardened my heart against this impossible dawn
Yet it seems to me that there were moments when it needed but a cry but one word to have united us again for all our lives
Could we have united again
Would that passage have enlightened us for ever or should we have fallen back in a week or so into the old estrangement the old temperamental opposition
Of that there is now no telling
Our own resolve carried us on our predestined way
We behaved more and more like separating lovers parting inexorably but all the preparations we had set going worked on like a machine and we made no attempt to stop them
My trunks and boxes went to the station
I packed my bag with Marion standing before me
We were like children who had hurt each other horribly in sheer stupidity who didnt know now how to remedy it
We belonged to each other immenselyimmensely
The cab came to the little iron gate
Goodbye
I said
Goodbye
For a moment we held one another in each others arms and kissedincredibly without malice
We heard our little servant in the passage going to open the door
For the last time we pressed ourselves to one another
We were not lovers nor enemies but two human souls in a frank community of pain
I tore myself from her
Go away I said to the servant seeing that Marion had followed me down
I felt her standing behind me as I spoke to the cab man
I got into the cab resolutely not looking back and then as it started jumped up craned out and looked at the door
It was wide open but she had disappeared
I wonderI suppose she ran upstairs
X So I parted from Marion at an extremity of perturbation and regret and went as I had promised and arranged to Effie who was waiting for me in apartments near Orpington
I remember her upon the station platform a bright flitting figure looking along the train for me and our walk over the fields in the twilight
I had expected an immense sense of relief where at last the stresses of separation were over but now I found I was beyond measure wretched and perplexed full of the profoundest persuasion of irreparable error
The dusk and somber Marion were so alike her sorrow seemed to be all about me
I had to hold myself to my own plans to remember that I must keep faith with Effie with Effie who had made no terms exacted no guarantees but flung herself into my hands
We went across the evening fields in silence towards a sky of deepening gold and purple and Effie was close beside me always very close glancing up ever and again at my face
Certainly she knew I grieved for Marion that ours was now no joyful reunion
But she showed no resentment and no jealousy
Extraordinarily she did not compete against Marion
Never once in all our time together did she say an adverse word of Marion She set herself presently to dispel the shadow that brooded over me with the same instinctive skill that some women will show with the trouble of a child
She made herself my glad and pretty slave and handmaid she forced me at last to rejoice in her
Yet at the back of it all Marion remained stupid and tearful and infinitely distressful so that I was almost intolerably unhappy for herfor her and the dead body of my married love
It is all as I tell it now unaccountable to me
I go back into these remote parts these rarely visited uplands and lonely tares of memory and it seems to me still a strange country
I had thought I might be going to some sensuous paradise with Effie but desire which fills the universe before its satisfaction vanishes utterly like the going of daylightwith achievement
All the facts and forms of life remain darkling and cold
It was an upland of melancholy questionings a region from which I saw all the world at new angles and in new aspects I had outflanked passion and romance
I had come into a condition of vast perplexities
For the first time in my life at least so it seems to me now in this retrospect I looked at my existence as a whole
Since this was nothing what was I doing
What was I for
I was going to and fro about TonoBungaythe business I had taken up to secure Marion and which held me now in spite of our intimate separationand snatching odd weekends and nights for Orpington and all the while I struggled with these obstinate interrogations
I used to fall into musing in the trains I became even a little inaccurate and forgetful about business things
I have the clearest memory of myself sitting thoughtful in the evening sunlight on a grassy hillside that looked toward Seven Oaks and commanded a wide sweep of country and that I was thinking out my destiny
I could almost write my thought down now I believe as they came to me that afternoon
Effie restless little cockney that she was rustled and struggled in a hedgerow below gathering flowers discovering flowers she had never seen before
I had
I remember a letter from Marion in my pocket
I had even made some tentatives for return for a reconciliation Heaven knows now how I had put it
but her cold illwritten letter repelled me
I perceived I could never face that old inconclusive dullness of life again that stagnant disappointment
That anyhow wasnt possible
But what was possible
I could see no way of honour or fine living before me at all
What am I to do with life
that was the question that besieged me
I wondered if all the world was even as I urged to this by one motive and to that by another creatures of chance and impulse and unmeaning traditions
Had I indeed to abide by what I had said and done and chosen
Was there nothing for me in honour but to provide for Effie go back penitent to Marion and keep to my trade in rubbishor find some fresh oneand so work out the residue of my days
I didnt accept that for a moment
But what else was I to do
I wondered if my case was the case of many men whether in former ages too men had been so guideless so uncharted so haphazard in their journey into life
In the Middle Ages in the old Catholic days one went to a priest and he said with all the finality of natural law this you are and this you must do
I wondered whether even in the Middle Ages I should have accepted that ruling without question
I remember too very distinctly how Effie came and sat beside me on a little box that was before the casement window of our room
Gloomkins said she
I smiled and remained head on hand looking out of the window forgetful of her
Did you love your wife so well
she whispered softly
Oh
I cried recalled again I dont know
I dont understand these things
Life is a thing that hurts my dear
It hurts without logic or reason
Ive blundered
I didnt understand
Anyhowthere is no need to go hurting you is there
And I turned about and drew her to me and kissed her ear
Yes I had a very bad timeI still recall
I suffered I suppose from a sort of ennui of the imagination
I found myself without an object to hold my will together
I sought
I read restlessly and discursively
I tried Ewart and got no help from him
As I regard it all now in this retrospect it seems to me as if in those days of disgust and abandoned aims I discovered myself for the first time
Before that I had seen only the world and things in it had sought them selfforgetful of all but my impulse
Now I found myself GROUPED with a system of appetites and satisfactions with much work to doand no desire it seemed left in me
There were moments when I thought of suicide
At times my life appeared before me in bleak relentless light a series of ignorances crude blunderings degradation and cruelty
I had what the old theologians call a conviction of sin
I sought salvationnot perhaps in the formula a Methodist preacher would recognise but salvation nevertheless
Men find their salvation nowadays in many ways
Names and forms dont I think matter very much the real need is something that we can hold and that holds one
I have known a man find that determining factor in a dryplate factory and another in writing a history of the Manor
So long as it holds one it does not matter
Many men and women nowadays take up some concrete aspect of Socialism or social reform
But Socialism for me has always been a little bit too human too set about with personalities and foolishness
It isnt my line
I dont like things so human
I dont think Im blind to the fun the surprises the jolly little coarsenesses and insufficiency of life to the humour of it as people say and to adventure but that isnt the root of the matter with me
Theres no humour in my blood
Im in earnest in warp and woof
I stumble and flounder but I know that over all these merry immediate things there are other things that are great and serene very high beautiful thingsthe reality
I havent got it but its there nevertheless
Im a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses
Ive never seen the goddesses nor ever shallbut it takes all the fun out of the mudand at times I fear it takes all the kindliness too
But Im talking of things I cant expect the reader to understand because I dont half understand them myself
There is something links things for me a sunset or so a mood or so the high air something there was in Marions form and colour something I find and lose in Mantegnas pictures something in the lines of these boats I make
You should see X2 my last and best
I cant explain myself I perceive
Perhaps it all comes to this that I am a hard and morally limited cad with a mind beyond my merits
Naturally I resist that as a complete solution
Anyhow I had a sense of inexorable need of distress and insufficiency that was unendurable and for a time this aeronautical engineering allayed it
In the end of this particular crisis of which I tell so badly I idealised Science
I decided that in power and knowledge lay the salvation of my life the secret that would fill my need that to these things I would give myself
I emerged at last like a man who has been diving in darkness clutching at a new resolve for which he had groped desperately and long
I came into the inner office suddenly one dayit must have been just before the time of Marions suit for restitutionand sat down before my uncle
Look here I said Im sick of this
HulLO
he answered and put some papers aside
Whats up George
Things are wrong
As how
My life I said its a mess an infinite mess
Shes been a stupid girl George he said I partly understand
But youre quit of her now practically and theres just as good fish in the sea Oh
its not that
I cried
Thats only the part that shows
Im sickIm sick of all this damned rascality
Eh
Eh
said my uncle
WHATrascality
Oh YOU know
I want some STUFF man
I want something to hold on to
I shall go amok if I dont get it
Im a different sort of beast from you
You float in all this bunkum
I feel like a man floundering in a universe of soapsuds up and downs east and west
I cant stand it
I must get my foot on something solid orI dont know what
I laughed at the consternation in his face
I mean it I said
Ive been thinking it over
Ive made up my mind
Its no good arguing
I shall go in for workreal work
No
this isnt work its only laborious cheating
But Ive got an idea
Its an old ideaI thought of years ago but it came back to me
Look here
Why should I fence about with you
I believe the time has come for flying to be possible
Real flying
Flying
I stuck to that and it helped me through the worst time in my life
My uncle after some halfhearted resistance and a talk with my aunt behaved like the father of a spoilt son
He fixed up an arrangement that gave me capital to play with released me from too constant a solicitude for the newer business developmentsthis was in what I may call the later Moggs period of our enterprisesand I went to work at once with grim intensity
But I will tell of my soaring and flying machines in the proper place
Ive been leaving the story of my uncle altogether too long
I wanted merely to tell how it was I took to this work
I took to these experiments after I had sought something that Marion in some indefinable way had seemed to promise
I toiled and forgot myself for a time and did many things
Science too has been something of an irresponsive mistress since though Ive served her better than I served Marion
But at the time Science with her order her inhuman distance yet steely certainties saved me from despair
Well I have still to fly but incidentally I have invented the lightest engines in the world
I am trying to tell of all the things that happened to me
Its hard enough simply to get it put down in the remotest degree right
But this is a novel not a treatise
Dont imagine that I am coming presently to any sort of solution of my difficulties
Here among my drawings and hammerings NOW I still question unanswering problems
All my life has been at bottom SEEKING disbelieving always dissatisfied always with the thing seen and the thing believed seeking something in toil in force in danger something whose name and nature I do not clearly understand something beautiful worshipful enduring mine profoundly and fundamentally and the utter redemption of myself I dont knowall I can tell is that it is something I have ever failed to find
XI But before I finish this chapter and book altogether and go on with the great adventure of my uncles career
I may perhaps tell what else remains to tell of Marion and Effie and then for a time set my private life behind me
For a time Marion and I corresponded with some regularity writing friendly but rather uninforming letters about small business things
The clumsy process of divorce completed itself
She left the house at Ealing and went into the country with her aunt and parents taking a small farm near Lewes in Sussex
She put up glass she put in heat for her father happy man
and spoke of figs and peaches
The thing seemed to promise well throughout a spring and summer but the Sussex winter after London was too much for the Ramboats
They got very muddy and dull Mr Ramboat killed a cow by improper feeding and that disheartened them all
A twelvemonth saw the enterprise in difficulties
I had to help her out of this and then they returned to London and she went into partnership with Smithie at Streatham and ran a business that was intimated on the firms stationery as Robes
The parents and aunt were stowed away in a cottage somewhere
After that the letters became infrequent
But in one I remember a postscript that had a little stab of our old intimacy Poor old Miggles is dead
Nearly eight years slipped by
I grew up
I grew in experience in capacity until I was fully a man but with many new interests living on a larger scale in a wider world than I could have dreamt of in my Marion days
Her letters become rare and insignificant
At last came a gap of silence that made me curious
For eighteen months or more I had nothing from Marion save her quarterly receipts through the bank
Then I damned at Smithie and wrote a card to Marion
Dear Marion I said how goes it
She astonished me tremendously by telling me she had married againa Mr Wachorn a leading agent in the paperpattern trade
But she still wrote on the Ponderevo and Smith Robes notepaper from the Ponderevo and Smith address
And that except for a little difference of opinion about the continuance of alimony which gave me some passages of anger and the use of my name by the firm which also annoyed me is the end of Marions history for me and she vanishes out of this story
I do not know where she is or what she is doing
I do not know whether she is alive or dead
It seems to me utterly grotesque that two people who have stood so close to one another as she and I should be so separated but so it is between us
Effie too I have parted from though I still see her at times
Between us there was never any intention of marriage nor intimacy of soul
She had a sudden fierce hotblooded passion for me and I for her but I was not her first lover nor her last
She was in another world from Marion
She had a queer delightful nature Ive no memory of ever seeing her sullen or malicious
She wasindeed she was magnificentlyeupeptic
That I think was the central secret of her agreeableness and moreover that she was infinitely kindhearted
I helped her at last into an opening she coveted and she amazed me by a sudden display of business capacity
She has now a typewriting bureau in Riffles Inn and she runs it with a brisk vigour and considerable success albeit a certain plumpness has overtaken her
And she still loves her kind
She married a year or so ago a boy half her agea wretch of a poet a wretched poet and given to drugs a thing with lank fair hair always getting into his blue eyes and limp legs
She did it she said because he needed nursing
But enough of this disaster of my marriage and of my early love affairs I have told all that is needed for my picture to explain how I came to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering science let me get back to my essential story to TonoBungay and my uncles promotions and to the vision of the world these things have given me
BOOK THE THIRD THE GREAT DAYS OF TONOBUNGAY CHAPTER THE FIRST THE HARDINGHAM HOTEL AND HOW WE BECAME BIG PEOPLE I But now that I resume the main line of my story it may be well to describe the personal appearance of my uncle as I remember him during those magnificent years that followed his passage from trade to finance
The little man plumped up very considerably during the creation of the TonoBungay property but with the increasing excitements that followed that first flotation came dyspepsia and a certain flabbiness and falling away
His abdomenif the reader will pardon my taking his features in the order of their valuehad at first a nice full roundness but afterwards it lost tone without however losing size
He always went as though he was proud of it and would make as much of it as possible
To the last his movements remained quick and sudden his short firm legs as he walked seemed to twinkle rather than display the scissorsstride of common humanity and he never seemed to have knees but instead a dispersed flexibility of limb
There was I seem to remember a secular intensification of his features his nose developed character became aggressive stuck out at the world more and more the obliquity of his mouth I think increased
From the face that returns to my memory projects a long cigar that is sometimes cocked jauntily up from the higher corner that sometimes droops from the lowerit was as eloquent as a dogs tail and he removed it only for the more emphatic modes of speech
He assumed a broad black ribbon for his glasses and wore them more and more askew as time went on
His hair seemed to stiffen with success but towards the climax it thinned greatly over the crown and he brushed it hard back over his ears where however it stuck out fiercely
It always stuck out fiercely over his forehead up and forward
He adopted an urban style of dressing with the onset of TonoBungay and rarely abandoned it
He preferred silk hats with ample rich brims often a trifle large for him by modern ideas and he wore them at various angles to his axis his taste in trouserings was towards fairly emphatic stripes and his trouser cut was neat he liked his frockcoat long and full although that seemed to shorten him
He displayed a number of valuable rings and I remember one upon his left little finger with a large red stone bearing Gnostic symbols
Clever chaps those Gnostics George he told me
Means a lot
Lucky
He never had any but a black mohair watchchair
In the country he affected grey and a large grey cloth tophat except when motoring then he would have a brown deerstalker cap and a fur suit of esquimaux cut with a sort of bootend to the trousers
Of an evening he would wear white waistcoats and plain gold studs
He hated diamonds
Flashy he said they were
Might as well wearan income taxreceipt
All very well for Park Lane
Unsold stock
Not my style
Sober financier George
So much for his visible presence
For a time it was very familiar to the world for at the crest of the boom he allowed quite a number of photographs and at least one pencil sketch to be published in the sixpenny papers
His voice declined during those years from his early tenor to a flat rich quality of sound that my knowledge of music is inadequate to describe
His Zzzing inrush of air became less frequent as he ripened but returned in moments of excitement
Throughout his career in spite of his increasing and at last astounding opulence his more intimate habits remained as simple as they had been at Wimblehurst
He would never avail himself of the services of a valet at the very climax of his greatness his trousers were folded by a housemaid and his shoulders brushed as he left his house or hotel
He became wary about breakfast as life advanced and at one time talked much of Dr Haig and uric acid
But for other meals he remained reasonably omnivorous
He was something of a gastronome and would eat anything he particularly liked in an audible manner and perspire upon his forehead
He was a studiously moderate drinkerexcept when the spirit of some public banquet or some great occasion caught him and bore him beyond his warinessthere he would as it were drink inadvertently and become flushed and talkativeabout everything but his business projects
To make the portrait complete one wants to convey an effect of sudden quick bursts of movement like the jumps of a Chinesecracker to indicate that his pose whatever it is has been preceded and will be followed by a rush
If I were painting him I should certainly give him for a background that distressed uneasy sky that was popular in the eighteenth century and at a convenient distance a throbbing motorcar very big and contemporary a secretary hurrying with papers and an alert chauffeur
Such was the figure that created and directed the great property of TonoBungay and from the successful reconstruction of that company passed on to a slow crescendo of magnificent creations and promotions until the whole world of investors marveled
I have already I think mentioned how long before we offered Tono Bungay to the public we took over the English agency of certain American specialties
To this was presently added our exploitation of Moggs Domestic Soap and so he took up the Domestic Convenience Campaign that coupled with his equatorial rotundity and a certain resolute convexity in his bearings won my uncle his Napoleonic title
II It illustrates the romantic element in modern commerce that my uncle met young Moggs at a city dinnerI think it was the Bottlemakers Companywhen both were some way advanced beyond the initial sobriety of the occasion
This was the grandson of the original Moggs and a very typical instance of an educated cultivated degenerate plutocrat
His people had taken him about in his youth as the Ruskins took their John and fostered a passion for history in him and the actual management of the Moggs industry had devolved upon a cousin and a junior partner
Mr Moggs being of a studious and refined disposition had just decidedafter a careful search for a congenial subject in which he would not be constanty reminded of soapto devote himself to the History of the Thebaid when this cousin died suddenly and precipitated responsibilities upon him
In the frankness of conviviality Moggs bewailed the uncongenial task thus thrust into his hands and my uncle offered to lighten his burden by a partnership then and there
They even got to termsextremely muzzy terms but terms nevertheless
Each gentleman wrote the name and address of the other on his cuff and they separated in a mood of brotherly carelessness and next morning neither seems to have thought to rescue his shirt from the wash until it was too late
My uncle made a painful struggleit was one of my business morningsto recall name and particulars
He was an aquariumfaced long blond sort of chap George with glasses and a genteel accent he said
I was puzzled
Aquariumfaced
You know how they look at you
His stuff was soap Im pretty nearly certain
And he had a nameAnd the thing was the straightest BitofAllright you ever
I was clear enough to spot that We went out at last with knitted brows and wandered up into Finsbury seeking a good wellstocked looking grocer
We called first on a chemist for a pickmeup for my uncle and then we found the shop we needed
I want said my uncle half a pound of every sort of soap you got
Yes I want to take them now
Wait a moment George Now what sort of soap dyou call THAT
At the third repetition of that question the young man said Moggs Domestic
Right said my uncle
You neednt guess again
Come along George lets go to a telephone and get on to Moggs
Ohthe order
Certainly
I confirm it
Send it allsend it all to the Bishop of London hell have some good use for itFirstrate man George he ischarities and all thatand put it down to me heres a cardPonderevoTonoBungay
Then we went on to Moggs and found him in a camelhair dressingjacket in a luxurious bed drinking China tea and got the shape of everything but the figures fixed by lunch time
Young Moggs enlarged my mind considerably he was a sort of thing I hadnt met before he seemed quite clean and wellinformed and he assured me to never read newspapers nor used soap in any form at all Delicate skin he said
No objection to our advertising you wide and free
said my uncle
I draw the line at railway stations said Moggs southcoast cliffs theatre programmes books by me and poetry generallysceneryohand the Mercure de France
Well get along said my uncle
So long as you dont annoy me said Moggs lighting a cigarette you can make me as rich as you like
We certainly made him no poorer
His was the first firm that was advertised by a circumstantial history we even got to illustrated magazine articles telling of the quaint past of Moggs
We concocted Moggsiana
Trusting to our partners preoccupation with the uncommercial aspects of life we gave graceful historyof Moggs the First Moggs the Second Moggs the Third and Moggs the Fourth
You must unless you are very young remember some of them and our admirable block of a Georgian shop window
My uncle brought early nineteenthcentury memoirs soaked himself in the style and devised stories about old Moggs the First and the Duke of Wellington George the Third and the soap dealer almost certainly old Moggs
Very soon we had added to the original Moggs Primrose several varieties of scented and superfatted a special nurseries used in the household of the Duke of Kent and for the old Queen in Infancy a plate powder the Paragon and a knife powder
We roped in a good little secondrate blacklead firm and carried their origins back into the mists of antiquity
It was my uncles own unaided idea that we should associate that commodity with the Black Prince
He became industriously curious about the past of blacklead
I remember his buttonholing the president of the Pepys Society
I say is there any blacklead in Pepys
You know blackleadfor grates
OR DOES HE PASS IT OVER AS A MATTER OF COURSE
He became in those days the terror of eminent historians
Dont want your drum and trumpet historyno fear he used to say
Dont want to know who was whos mistress and why soandso devastated such a province thats bound to be all lies and upsydown anyhow
Not my affair
Nobodys affair now
Chaps who did it didnt clearly know What I want to know is in the Middle Ages did they do anything for Housemaids Knee
What did they put in their hot baths after jousting and was the Black Princeyou know the Black Princewas he enameled or painted or what
I think myself blackleadedvery likelylike pipeclaybut DID they use blacking so early
So it came about that in designing and writing those Moggs Soap Advertisements that wrought a revolution in that department of literature my uncle was brought to realise not only the lost history but also the enormous field for invention and enterprise that lurked among the little articles the dustpans and mincers the mousetraps and carpetsweepers that fringe the shops of the oilman and domestic ironmonger
He was recalled to one of the dreams of his youth to his conception of the Ponderevo Patent Flat that had been in his mind so early as the days before I went to serve him at Wimblehurst
The Home George he said wants straightening up
Silly muddle
Things that get in the way
Got to organise it
For a time he displayed something like the zeal of a genuine social reformer in relation to these matters
Weve got to bring the Home Up to Date
Thats my idee George
We got to make a civilised domestic machine out of these relics of barbarism
Im going to hunt up inventors make a corner in dmestic ideas
Everything
Balls of string that wont dissolve into a tangle and gum that wont dry into horn
See
Then after conveniencesbeauty
Beauty George
All these few things ought to be made fit to look at its your aunts idea that
Beautiful jampots
Get one of those new art chaps to design all the things they make ugly now
Patent carpetsweepers by these greenwood chaps housemaids boxes itll be a pleasure to fall overrich coloured houseflannels
Zzzz
Pails frinstance
Hang em up on the walls like warmingpans
All the polishes and things in such tinsyoull want to cuddle em George
See the notion
Sted of all the silly ugly things we got
We had some magnificent visions they so affected me that when I passed ironmongers and oilshops they seemed to me as full of promise as trees in late winter flushed with the effort to burst into leaf and flower And really we did do much towards that very brightness these shops display
They were dingy things in the eighties compared to what our efforts have made them now grey quiet displays
Well I dont intend to write down here the tortuous financial history of Moggs Limited which was our first development of Moggs and Sons nor will I tell very much of how from that we spread ourselves with a larger and larger conception throughout the chandlery and minor ironmongery how we became agents for this little commodity partners in that got a tentacle round the neck of a specialised manufacturer or so secured a pull upon this or that supply of raw material and so prepared the way for our second flotation Domestic Utilities Do it they reordered it in the city
And then came the reconstruction of TonoBungay and then Household services and the Boom
That sort of development is not to he told in detail in a novel
I have indeed told much of it elsewhere
It is to be found set out at length painfully at length in my uncles examination and mine in the bankruptcy proceedings and in my own various statements after his death
Some people know everything in that story some know it all too well most do not want the details
it is the story of a man of imagination among figures and unless you are prepared to collate columns of pounds shillings and pence compare dates and check additions you will find it very unmeaning and perplexing
And after all you wouldnt find the early figures so much wrong as STRAINED
In the matter of Moggs and Do Ut as in the first TonoBungay promotion and in its reconstruction we left the court by city standards without a stain on our characters
The great amalgamation of Household Services was my uncles first really bigscale enterprise and his first display of bolder methods for this we bought back Do Ut Moggs going strong with a seven per cent
dividend and acquired Skinnertons polishes the Riffleshaw properties and the Runcorns mincer and coffeemill business
To that Amalgamation I was really not a party I left it to my uncle because I was then beginning to get keen upon the soaring experiments I had taken on from the results then to hand of Lilienthal Pilcher and the Wright brothers
I was developing a glider into a flyer
I meant to apply power to this glider as soon as I could work out one or two residual problems affecting the longitudinal stability
I knew that I had a sufficiently light motor in my own modification of Bridgers light turbine but I knew too that until I had cured my aeroplane of a tendency demanding constant alertness from me a tendency to jerk up its nose at unexpected moments and slide back upon me the application of an engine would be little short of suicide
But that I will tell about later
The point I was coming to was that I did not realise until after the crash how recklessly my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent
on the ordinary shares of that hugely overcapitalised enterprise Household Services
I drifted out of business affairs into my research much more than either I or my uncle had contemplated
Finance was much less to my taste than the organisation of the TonoBungay factory
In the new field of enterprise there was a great deal of bluffing and gambling of taking chances and concealing material factsand these are hateful things to the scientific type of mind
It wasnt fear I felt so much as an uneasy inaccuracy
I didnt realise dangers I simply disliked the sloppy relaxing quality of this new sort of work
I was at last constantly making excuses not to come up to him in London
The latter part of his business career recedes therefore beyond the circle of any particular life
I lived more or less with him I talked I advised I helped him at times to fight his Sunday crowd at Crest Hill but I did not follow nor guide him
From the Do Ut time onward he rushed up the financial world like a bubble in water and left me like some busy waterthing down below in the deeps
Anyhow he was an immense success
The public was I think particularly attracted by the homely familiarity of his field of workyou never lost sight of your investment they felt with the name on the houseflannel and shavingstropand its allegiance was secured by the Egyptian solidity of his apparent results
TonoBungay after its reconstruction paid thirteen Moggs seven Domestic Utilities had been a safelooking nine here was Household Services with eight on such a showing he had merely to buy and sell Roeburns Antiseptic fluid Razor soaks and Bath crystals in three weeks to clear twenty thousand pounds
I do think that as a matter of fact Roeburns was good value at the price at which he gave it to the public at least until it was strained by illconserved advertisement
It was a period of expansion and confidence much money was seeking investment and Industrials were the fashion
Prices were rising all round
There remained little more for my uncle to do therefore in his climb to the high unstable crest of Financial Greatness but as he said to grasp the cosmic oyster George while it gaped which being translated meant for him to buy respectable businesses confidently and courageously at the vendors estimate add thirty or forty thousand to the price and sell them again
His sole difficulty indeed was the tactful management of the load of shares that each of these transactions left upon his hands
But I thought so little of these later things that I never fully appreciated the peculiar inconveniences of that until it was too late to help him
III When I think of my uncle near the days of his Great Boom and in connection with the actualities of his enterprises I think of him as I used to see him in the suite of rooms he occupied in the Hardingham Hotel seated at a great old oak writingtable smoking drinking and incoherently busy that was his typical financial aspectour evenings our mornings our holidays our motorcar expeditions Lady Grove and Crest Hill belong to an altogether different set of memories
These rooms in the Hardingham were a string of apartments along one handsome thickcarpeted corridor
All the doors upon the corridor were locked except the first and my uncles bedroom breakfastroom and private sanctum were the least accessible and served by an entrance from the adjacent passage which he also used at times as a means of escape from importunate callers
The most eternal room was a general waitingroom and very businesslike in quality it had one or two uneasy sofas a number of chairs a green baize table and a collection of the very best Moggs and Tone posters and the plush carpets normal to the Hardingham had been replaced by a greygreen cork linoleum Here I would always find a remarkable miscellany of people presided over by a peculiarly faithful and ferocious looking commissioner Ropper who guarded the door that led a step nearer my uncle
Usually there would be a parson or so and one or two widows hairy eyeglassy middleaged gentlemen some of them looking singularly like Edward Ponderevos who hadnt come off a variety of young and youngish men more or less attractively dressed some with papers protruding from their pockets others with their papers decently concealed
And wonderful incidental frowsy people
All these persons maintained a practically hopeless siegesometimes for weeks together they had better have stayed at home
Next came a room full of people who had some sort of appointment and here one would find smartlooking people brilliantly dressed nervous women hiding behind magazines nonconformist divines clergy in gaiters real business men these latter for the most part gentlemen in admirable morning dress who stood up and scrutinised my uncles taste in water colours manfully and sometimes by the hour together
Young men again were here of various social origins young Americans treasonable clerks from other concerns university young men keenlooking most of them resolute reserved but on a sort of hair trigger ready at any moment to be most voluble most persuasive
This room had a window too looking out into the hotel courtyard with its fernset fountains and mosaic pavement and the young men would stand against this and sometimes even mutter
One day I heard one repeating in all urgent whisper as I passed But you dont quite see Mr Ponderevo the full advantages the FULL advantages I met his eye and he was embarrassed
Then came a room with a couple of secretariesno typewriters because my uncle hated the clatterand a casual person or two sitting about projectors whose projects were being entertained
Here and in a further room nearer the private apartments my uncles correspondence underwent an exhaustive process of pruning and digestion before it reached him
Then the two little rooms in which my uncle talked my magic uncle who had got the investing publicto whom all things were possible
As one came in we would find him squatting with his cigar up and an expression of dubious beatitude upon his face while some one urged him to grow still richer by this or that
Thatju George
he used to say
Come in
Heres a thing
Tell himMisterover again
Have a drink George
No
Wise man
Lissn
I was always ready to listen
All sorts of financial marvels came out of the Hardingham more particularly during my uncles last great flurry but they were nothing to the projects that passed in
It was the little brown and gold room he sat in usually
He had had it redecorated by Bordingly and half a dozen Sussex pictures by Webster hung about it
Latterly he wore a velveteen jacket of a goldenbrown colour in this apartment that I think overemphasised its esthetic intention and he also added some gross Chinese bronzes
He was on the whole a very happy man throughout all that wildly enterprising time
He made and as I shall tell in its place spent great sums of money
He was constantly in violent motion constantly stimulated mentally and physically and rarely tired
About him was an atmosphere of immense deference much of his waking life was triumphal and all his dreams
I doubt if he had any dissatisfaction with himself at all until the crash bore him down
Things must have gone very rapidly with him
I think he must have been very happy
As I sit here writing about all these things jerking down notes and throwing them aside in my attempt to give some literary form to the tale of our promotions the marvel of it all comes to me as if it came for the first time the supreme unreason of it
At the climax of his Boom my uncle at the most sparing estimate must have possessed in substance and credit about two million poundsworth of property to set off against his vague colossal liabilities and from first to last he must have had a controlling influence in the direction of nearly thirty millions
This irrational muddle of a community in which we live gave him that paid him at that rate for sitting in a room and scheming and telling it lies
For he created nothing he invented nothing he economised nothing
I cannot claim that a single one of the great businesses we organised added any real value to human life at all
Several like TonoBungay were unmitigated frauds by any honest standard the giving of nothing coated in advertisements for money
And the things the Hardingham gave out I repeat were nothing to the things that came in
I think of the long procession of people who sat down before us and propounded this and that
Now it was a device for selling bread under a fancy name and so escaping the laws as to weightthis was afterwards floated as the Decorticated HealthBread Company and bumped against the lawnow it was a new scheme for still more strident advertisement now it was a story of unsuspected deposits of minerals now a cheap and nasty substitute for this or that common necessity now the treachery of a too wellinformed employee anxious to become our partner
It was all put to us tentatively persuasively
Sometimes one had a large pink blusterous person trying to carry us off our feet by his pseudoboyish frankness now some dyspeptically yellow whisperer now some earnest specially dressed youth with an eyeglass and a buttonhole now some homelyspeaking shrewd Manchester man or some Scotchman eager to be very clear and full
Many came in couples or trios often in tow of an explanatory solicitor
Some were white and earnest some flustered beyond measure at their opportunity
Some of them begged and prayed to be taken up
My uncle chose what he wanted and left the rest
He became very autocratic to these applicants
He felt he could make them and they felt so too
He had but to say No
and they faded out of existence
He had become a sort of vortex to which wealth flowed of its own accord
His possessions increased by heaps his shares his leaseholds and mortgages and debentures
Behind his firstline things he found it necessary at last and sanctioned by all the precincts to set up three general trading companies the London and African Investment Company the British Traders Loan Company and Business Organisations Limited
This was in the culminating time when I had least to do with affairs
I dont say that with any desire to exculpate myself I admit I was a director of all three and I will confess I was willfully incurious in that capacity
Each of these companies ended its financial year solvent by selling great holdings of shares to one or other of its sisters and paying a dividend out of the proceeds
I sat at the table and agreed
That was our method of equilibrium at the iridescent climax of the bubble
You perceive now however the nature of the services for which this fantastic community have him unmanageable wealth and power and real respect
It was all a monstrous payment for courageous fiction a gratuity in return for the one reality of human lifeillusion
We gave them a feeling of hope and profit we sent a tidal wave of water and confidence into their stranded affairs
We mint Faith George said my uncle one day
Thats what we do
And by Jove we got to keep minting
We been making human confidence ever since I drove the first cork of TonoBungay
Coining would have been a better word than minting
And yet you know in a sense he was right
Civilisation is possible only through confidence so that we can bank our money and go unarmed about the streets
The bank reserve or a policeman keeping order in a jostling multitude of people are only slightly less impudent bluffs than my uncles prospectuses
They couldnt for a moment make good if the quarter of what they guarantee was demanded of them
The whole of this modern mercantile investing civilisation is indeed such stuff as dreams are made of
A mass of people swelters and toils great railway systems grow cities arise to the skies and spread wide and far mines are opened factories hum foundries roar ships plough the seas countries are settled about this busy striving world the rich owners go controlling all enjoying all confident and creating the confidence that draws us all together into a reluctant nearly unconscious brotherhood
I wonder and plan my engines
The flags flutter the crowds cheer the legislatures meet
Yet it seems to me indeed at times that all this present commercial civilisation is no more than my poor uncles career writ large a swelling thinning bubble of assurances that its arithmetic is just as unsound its dividends as illadvised its ultimate aim as vague and forgotten that it all drifts on perhaps to some tremendous parallel to his individual disaster Well so it was we Boomed and for four years and a half we lived a life of mingled substance and moonshine
Until our particular unsoundness overtook us we went about in the most magnificent of motorcars upon tangible high roads made ourselves conspicuous and stately in splendid houses ate sumptuously and had a perpetual stream of notes and money trickling into our pockets hundreds of thousands of men and women respected us saluted us and gave us toil and honour I asked and my worksheets rose my aeroplanes swooped out of nothingness to scare the downland pewits my uncle waved his hand and Lady Grove and all its associations of chivalry and ancient peace were his waved again and architects were busy planning the great palace he never finished at Crest Hill and an army of folkmen gathered to do his bidding blue marble came from Canada and timber from New Zealand and beneath it all you know there was nothing but fictitious values as evanescent as rainbow gold
IV I pass the Hardingham ever and again and glance aside through the great archway at the fountain and the ferns and think of those receding days when I was so near the centre of our eddy of greed and enterprise
I see again my uncles face white and intent and hear him discourse hear him make consciously Napoleonic decisions grip his nettles put his finger on the spot bluff say snap
He became particularly addicted to the last idiom
Towards the end every conceivable act took the form of saying snap
The odd fish that came to us
And among others came GordonNasmyth that queer blend of romance and illegality who was destined to drag me into the most irrelevant adventure in my life the Mordet Island affair and leave me as they say with blood upon my hands
It is remarkable how little it troubles my conscience and how much it stirs my imagination that particular memory of the life I took
The story of Mordet Island has been told in a government report and told all wrong there are still excellent reasons for leaving it wrong in places but the liveliest appeals of discretion forbid my leaving it out altogether
Ive still the vividest memory of GordonNasmyths appearance in the inner sanctum a lank sunburnt person in tweeds with a yellowbrown hatchet face and one faded blue eyethe other was a closed and sunken lidand how he told us with a stiff affectation of ease his incredible story of this great heap of quap that lay abandoned or undiscovered on the beach behind Mordets Island among white dead mangroves and the black ooze of brackish water
Whats quap
said my uncle on the fourth repetition of the word
They call it quap or quab or quabb said GordonNasmyth but our relations werent friendly enough to get the accent right
But there the stuff is for the taking
They dont know about it
Nobody knows about it
I got down to the damned place in a canoe alone
The boys wouldnt come
I pretended to be botanising
 To begin with GordonNasmyth was inclined to be dramatic
Look here he said when he first came in shutting the door rather carefully behind him as he spoke do you two menyes or nowant to put up six thousandfora clear good chance of fifteen hundred per cent
on your money in a year
Were always getting chances like that said my uncle cocking his cigar offensively wiping his glasses and tilting his chair back
We stick to a safe twenty
GordonNasmyths quick temper showed in a slight stiffening of his attitude
Dont you believe him said I getting up before he could reply
Youre different and I know your books
Were very glad youve come to us
Confound it uncle
Its GordonNasmyth
Sit down
What is it
Minerals
Quap said GordonNasmyth fixing his eye on me in heaps
In heaps said my uncle softly with his glasses very oblique
Youre only fit for the grocery said GordonNasmyth scornfully sitting down and helping himself to one of my uncles cigars
Im sorry I came
But still now Im here And first as to quap quap sir is the most radioactive stuff in the world
Thats quap
Its a festering mass of earths and heavy metals polonium radium ythorium thorium carium and new things too
Theres a stuff called Xkprovisionally
There they are mucked up together in a sort of rotting sand
What it is how it got made I dont know
Its like as if some young creator had been playing about there
There it lies in two heaps one small one great and the world for miles about it is blasted and scorched and dead
You can have it for the getting
Youve got to take itthats all
That sounds all right said I
Have you samples
Wellshould I
You can have anythingup to two ounces
Where is it
His blue eye smiled at me and scrutinised me
He smoked and was fragmentary for a time fending off my questions then his story began to piece itself together
He conjured up a vision of this strange forgotten kink in the worlds littoral of the long meandering channels that spread and divaricate and spend their burden of mud and silt within the thunderbelt of Atlantic surf of the dense tangled vegetation that creeps into the shimmering water with root and sucker
He gave a sense of heat and a perpetual reek of vegetable decay and told how at last comes a break among these things an arena fringed with bonewhite dead trees a sight of the hardblue sea line beyond the dazzling surf and a wide desolation of dirty shingle and mud bleached and scarred A little way off among charred dead weeds stands the abandoned stationabandoned because every man who stayed two months at that station stayed to die eaten up mysteriously like a leper with its dismantled sheds and its decaying pier of wormrotten and oblique piles and planks still insecurely possible
And in the midst two clumsy heaps shaped like the backs of hogs one small one great sticking out under a rib of rock that cuts the space acrossquap
There it is said GordonNasmyth worth three pounds an ounce if its worth a penny two great heaps of it rotten stuff and soft ready to shovel and wheel and you may get it by the ton
How did it get there
God knows

There it isfor the taking
In a country where you mustnt trade
In a country where the company waits for good kind men to find it riches and then take em away from em
There you have itderelict
Cant you do any sort of deal
Theyre too damned stupid
Youve got to go and take it
Thats all
They might catch you
They might of course
But theyre not great at catching
We went into the particulars of that difficulty
They wouldnt catch me because Id sink first
Give me a yacht said GordonNasmyth thats all I need
But if you get caught said my uncle
I am inclined to think GordonNasmyth imagined we would give him a cheque for six thousand pounds on the strength of his talk
It was very good talk but we didnt do that
I stipulated for samples of his stuff for analysis and he consentedreluctantly
I think on the whole he would rather I didnt examine samples
He made a motion pocketwards that gave us an invincible persuasion that he had a sample upon him and that at the last instant he decided not to produce it prematurely
There was evidently a curious strain of secretiveness in him
He didnt like to give us samples and he wouldnt indicate within three hundred miles the position of this Mordet Island of his
He had it clear in his mind that he had a secret of immense value and he had no idea at all of just how far he ought to go with business people
And so presently to gain time for these hesitations of his he began to talk of other things
He talked very well
He talked of the Dutch East Indies and of the Congo of Portuguese East Africa and Paraguay of Malays and rich Chinese merchants Dyaks and negroes and the spread of the Mahometan world in Africa today
And all this time he was trying to judge if we were good enough to trust with his adventure
Our cosy inner office became a little place and all our business cold and lifeless exploits beside his glimpses of strange minglings of men of slayings unavenged and curious customs of trade where no writs run and the dark treacheries of eastern ports and uncharted channels
We had neither of us gone abroad except for a few vulgar raids on Paris our world was England are the places of origin of half the raw material of the goods we sold had seemed to us as remote as fairyland or the forest of Arden
But GordonNasmyth made it so real and intimate for us that afternoonfor me at any ratethat it seemed like something seen and forgotten and now again remembered
And in the end he produced his sample a little lump of muddy clay speckled with brownish grains in a glass bottle wrapped about with lead and flannelred flannel it was I remembera hue which is I know popularly supposed to double all the mystical efficacies of flannel
Dont carry it about on you said GordonNasmyth
It makes a sore
I took the stuff to Thorold and Thorold had the exquisite agony of discovering two new elements in what was then a confidential analysis
He has christened them and published since but at the time GordonNasmyth wouldnt hear for a moment of our publication of any facts at all indeed he flew into a violent passion and abused me mercilessly even for showing the stuff to Thorold
I thought you were going to analyse it yourself he said with the touching persuasion of the layman that a scientific man knows and practises at the sciences
I made some commercial inquiries and there seemed even then much truth in GordonNasmyths estimate of the value of the stuff
It was before the days of Caperns discovery of the value of canadium and his use of it in the Capern filament but the cerium and thorium alone were worth the money he extracted for the gasmantles then in vogue
There were however doubts
Indeed there were numerous doubts
What were the limits of the gasmantle trade
How much thorium not to speak of cerium could they take at a maximum
Suppose that quantity was high enough to justify our shipload came doubts in another quarter
Were the heaps up to sample
Were they as big as he said
Was GordonNasmythimaginative
And if these values held could we after all get the stuff
It wasnt ours
It was on forbidden ground
You see there were doubts of every grade and class in the way of this adventure
We went some way nevertheless in the discussion of his project though I think we tried his patience
Then suddenly he vanished from London and I saw no more of him for a year and a half
My uncle said that was what he had expected and when at last GordonNasmyth reappeared and mentioned in an incidental way that he had been to Paraguay on private and we guessed passionate affairs the business of the quap expedition had to be begun again at the beginning
My uncle was disposed to be altogether sceptical but I wasnt so decided
I think I was drawn by its picturesque aspects
But we neither of us dreamt of touching it seriously until Caperns discovery
Nasmyths story had laid hold of my imagination like one small intense picture of tropical sunshine hung on a wall of grey business affairs
I kept it going during GordonNasmyths intermittent appearances in England
Every now and then he and I would meet and reinforce its effect
We would lunch in London or he would cone to see my gliders at Crest Hill and make new projects for getting at those heaps again now with me now alone
At times they became a sort of fairystory with us an imaginative exercise
And there came Caperns discovery of what he called the ideal filament and with it an altogether less problematical quality about the business side of quap
For the ideal filament needed five per cent
of canadium and canadium was known to the world only as a newly separated constituent of a variety of the rare mineral rutile
But to Thorold it was better known as an element in a mysterious sample brought to him by me and to me it was known as one of the elements in quap
I told my uncle and we jumped on to the process at once
We found that GordonNasmyth still unaware of the altered value of the stuff and still thinking of the experimental prices of radium and the rarity value of cerium had got hold of a cousin named Pollack made some extraordinary transaction about his life insurance policy and was buying a brig
We put in put down three thousand pounds and forthwith the life insurance transaction and the Pollack side of this finance vanished into thin air leaving Pollack I regret to say in the brig and in the secretexcept so far as canadium and the filament wentas residuum
We discussed earnestly whether we should charter a steamer or go on with the brig but we decided on the brig as a less conspicuous instrument for an enterprise that was after all to put it plainly stealing
But that was one of our last enterprises before our great crisis and I will tell of it in its place
So it was quap came into our affairs came in as a fairytale and became real
More and more real it grew until at last it was real until at last I saw with my eyes the heaps my imagination had seen for so long and felt between my fingers again that halfgritty half soft texture of quap like sanded moistsugar mixed with clay in which there stirs something One must feel it to understand
V All sorts of things came to the Hardingham and offered themselves to my uncle
GordonNasmyth stands but only because he played a part at last in the crisis of our fortunes
So much came to us that it seemed to me at times as though the whole world of human affairs was ready to prostitute itself to our real and imaginary millions
As I look back I am still dazzled and incredulous to think of the quality of our opportunities
We did the most extraordinary things things that it seems absurd to me to leave to any casual man of wealth and enterprise who cares to do them
I had some amazing perceptions of just how modern thought and the supply of fact to the general mind may be controlled by money
Among other things that my uncle offered for he tried very hard to buy the British Medical Journal and the Lancet and run them on what he called modern lines and when they resisted him he talked very vigorously for a time of organising a rival enterprise
That was a very magnificent idea indeed in its way it would have given a tremendous advantage in the handling of innumerable specialties and indeed I scarcely know how far it would not have put the medical profession in our grip
It still amazes meI shall die amazedthat such a thing can be possible in the modern state
If my uncle failed to bring the thing off some one else may succeed
But I doubt even if he had got both these weeklies whether his peculiar style would have suited them
The change of purpose would have shown
He would have found it difficult to keep up their dignity
He certainly did not keep up the dignity of the Sacred Grove an important critical organ which he acquired one dayby saying snapfor eight hundred pounds
He got it lock stock and barrelunder one or other of which three aspects the editor was included
Even at that price it didnt pay
If you are a literary person you will remember the bright new cover he gave that representative organ of British intellectual culture and how his sound business instincts jarred with the exalted pretensions of a vanishing age

 THE BEST PILL IN THE WORLD FOR AN IRREGULAR LIVER I suppose it is some lingering traces of the Bladesover tradition to me that makes this combination of letters and pills seem so incongruous just as I suppose it is a lingering trace of Plutarch and my ineradicable boyish imagination that at bottom our State should be wise sane and dignified that makes me think a country which leaves its medical and literary criticism or indeed any such vitally important criticism entirely to private enterprise and open to the advances of any purchaser must be in a frankly hopeless condition
These are ideal conceptions of mine
As a matter of fact nothing would be more entirely natural and representative of the relations of learning thought and the economic situation in the world at the present time than this cover of the Sacred Grovethe quiet conservatism of the one element embedded in the aggressive brilliance of the other the contrasted notes of bold physiological experiment and extreme mental immobility
VI There comes back too among these Hardingham memories an impression of a drizzling November day and how we looked out of the windows upon a procession of the London unemployed
It was like looking down a well into some momentarily revealed nether world
Some thousands of needy ineffectual men had been raked together to trail their spiritless misery through the West Eire with an appeal that was also in its way a weak and insubstantial threat It is Work we need not Charity
There they were halfphantom through the fog a silent footdragging interminable grey procession
They carried wet dirty banners they rattled boxes for pence these men who had not said snap in the right place the men who had snapped too eagerly the men who had never said snap the men who had never had a chance of saying snap
A shambling shameful stream they made oozing along the street the gutter waste of competitive civilisation
And we stood high out of it all as high as if we looked godlike from another world standing in a room beautifully lit and furnished skillfully warmed filled with costly things
There thought I but for the grace of God go George and Edward Ponderevo
But my uncles thoughts ran in a different channel and he made that vision the test of a spirited but inconclusive harangue upon Tariff Reform
CHAPTER THE SECOND OUR PROGRESS FROM CAMDEN TOWN TO CREST HILL I So far my history of my aunt and uncle has dealt chiefly with his industrial and financial exploits
But side by side with that history of inflation from the infinitesimal to the immense is another development the change year by year from the shabby impecuniosity of the Camden Town lodging to the lavish munificence of the Crest Hill marble staircase and my aunts golden bed the bed that was facsimiled from Fontainebleau
And the odd thing is that as I come to this nearer part of my story I find it much more difficult to tell than the clear little perspective memories of the earlier days
Impressions crowd upon one another and overlap one another I was presently to fall in love again to be seized by a passion to which I still faintly respond a passion that still clouds my mind
I came and went between Ealing and my aunt and uncle and presently between Effie and clubland and then between business and a life of research that became far more continuous infinitely more consecutive and memorable than any of these other sets of experiences
I didnt witness a regular social progress therefore my aunt and uncle went up in the world so far as I was concerned as if they were displayed by an early cinematograph with little jumps and flickers
As I recall this side of our life the figure of my roundeyes buttonnosed pinkandwhite Aunt Susan tends always to the central position
We drove the car and sustained the car she sat in it with a magnificent variety of headgear poised upon her delicate neck and always with that faint ghost of a lisp no misspelling can rendercommented on and illuminated the new aspects
Ive already sketched the little home behind the Wimblehurst chemists shop the lodging near the Cobden statue and the apartments in Gower Street
Thence my aunt and uncle went into a flat in Redgauntlet Mansions
There they lived when I married
It was a compact flat with very little for a woman to do in it In those days my aunt I think used to find the time heavy upon her hands and so she took to books and reading and after a time even to going to lectures in the afternoon
I began to find unexpected books upon her table sociological books travels Shaws plays
Hullo
I said at the sight of some volume of the latter
Im keeping a mind George she explained
Eh
Keeping a mind
Dogs I never cared for
Its been a tossup between setting up a mind and setting up a soul
Its jolly lucky for Him and you its a mind
Ive joined the London Library and Im going in for the Royal Institution and every blessed lecture that comes along next winter
Youd better look out
And I remember her coming in late one evening with a notebook in her hand
Where ya been Susan
said my uncle
BirkbeckPhysiology
Im getting on
She sat down and took off her gloves
Youre just glass to me she sighed and then in a note of grave reproach You old PACKAGE
I had no idea
The Things youve kept from me
Presently they were setting up the house at Beckengham and my aunt intermitted her intellectual activities
The house at Beckengham was something of an enterprise for them at that time a reasonably large place by the standards of the early years of TonoBungay
It was a big rather gaunt villa with a conservatory and a shrubbery a tennislawn a quite considerable vegetable garden and a small disused coachhouse
I had some glimpses of the excitements of its inauguration but not many because of the estrangement between my aunt and Marion
My aunt went into that house with considerable zest and my uncle distinguished himself by the thoroughness with which he did the repainting and replumbing
He had all the drains up and most of the garden with them and stood administrative on heapsadministrating whisky to the workmen
I found him there one day most Napoleonic on a little Elba of dirt in an atmosphere that defies print
He also I remember chose what he considered cheerful contrasts of colours for the painting of the woodwork
This exasperated my aunt extremelyshe called him a Pestilential old Splosher with an unusual note of earnestnessand he also enraged her into novelties of abuse by giving each bedroom the name of some favourite heroCliff Napoleon Caesar and so forthand having it painted on the door in gilt letters on a black label
Martin Luther was kept for me
Only her respect for domestic discipline she said prevented her retaliating with Old Pondo on the housemaids cupboard
Also he went and ordered one of the completest sets of garden requisites I have ever seenand had them all painted a hard clear blue
My aunt got herself large tins of a kindlier hued enamel and had everything secretly recoated and this done she found great joy in the garden and became an ardent rose grower and herbaceous borderer leaving her Mind indeed to damp evenings and the winter months
When I think of her at Beckenham I always think first of her as dressed in that blue cotton stuff she affected with her arms in huge gauntleted gardening gloves a trowel in one hand and a small but no doubt hardy and promising annual limp and very younglooking and sheepish in the other
Beckenham in the persons of a vicar a doctors wife and a large proud lady called Hogberry called on my uncle and aunt almost at once so soon in fact as the lawn was down again and afterwards my aunt made friends with a quiet gentlewoman next door a propos of an overhanging cherry tree and the need of repairing the party fence
So she resumed her place in society from which she had fallen with the disaster of Wimblehurst
She made a partially facetious study of the etiquette of her position had cards engraved and retaliated calls
And then she received a card for one of Mrs Hogberrys At Homes gave an old garden party herself participated in a bazaar and sale of work and was really becoming quite cheerfully entangled in Beckenham society when she was suddenly taken up by the roots again by my uncle and transplanted to Chiselhurst
Old Trek George she said compactly Onward and Up when I found her superintending the loading of two big furniture vans
Go up and say goodbye to Martin Luther and then Ill see what you can do to help me
II I look into the jumbled stores of the middle distance of memory and Beckenham seems to me a quite transitory phase
But really they were there several years through nearly all my married life in fact and far longer than the year and odd months we lived together at Wimblehurst
But the Wimblehurst time with them is fuller in my memory by far then the Beckenham period
There comes back to me with a quite considerable amount of detail the effect of that garden party of my aunts and of a little social misbehaviour of which I was guilty on that occasion
Its like a scrap from another life
Its all set in what is for me a kind of cutaneous feeling the feeling of rather illcut city clothes frock coat and grey trousers and of a high collar and tie worn in sunshine among flowers
I have still a quite vivid memory of the little trapezoidal lawn of the gathering and particularly of the hats and feathers of the gathering of the parlourmaid and the blue teacups and of the magnificent presence of Mrs Hogberry and of her clear resonant voice
It was a voice that would have gone with a garden party on a larger scale it went into adjacent premises it included the gardener who was far up the vegetable patch and technically out of play
The only other men were my aunts doctor two of the clergy amiable contrasted men and Mrs Hogberrys imperfectly grownup son a youth just bursting into collar
The rest were women except for a young girl or so in a state of speechless good behaviour
Marion also was there
Marion and I had arrived a little estranged and I remember her as a silent presence a shadow across all that sunlit emptiness of intercourse
We had embittered each other with one of those miserable little disputes that seemed so unavoidable between us
She had with the help of Smithie dressed rather elaborately for the occasion and when she saw me prepared to accompany her in I think it was a grey suit she protested that silk hat and frock coat were imperative
I was recalcitrant she quoted an illustrated paper showing a garden party with the King present and finally I capitulatedbut after my evil habit resentfully Eh dear
those old quarrels how pitiful they were how trivial
And how sorrowful they are to recall
I think they grow more sorrowful as I grow older and all the small passionate reasons for our mutual anger fade and fade out of memory
The impression that Beckenham company has left on my mind is one of a modest unreality they were all maintaining a front of unspecified social pretension and evading the display of the economic facts of the case
Most of the husbands were in business off stage it would have been outrageous to ask what the business wasand the wives were giving their energies to produce with the assistance of novels and the illustrated magazines a moralised version of the afternoon life of the aristocratic class
They hadnt the intellectual or moral enterprise of the upperclass woman they had no political interests they had no views about anything and consequently they were I remember extremely difficult to talk to
They all sat about in the summerhouse and in gardenchairs and were very hatty and ruffley and sunshady
Three ladies and the curate played croquet with a general immense gravity broken by occasional loud cries of feigned distress from the curate
Oh
Whacking me about again
Augh
The dominant social fact that afternoon was Mrs Hogberry she took up a certain position commanding the croquet and went on as my aunt said to me in an incidental aside like an old Roundabout
She talked of the way in which Beckenham society was getting mixed and turned on to a touching letter she had recently received from her former nurse at Little Gossdean
Followed a loud account of Little Gossdean and how much she and her eight sisters had been looked up to there
My poor mother was quite a little Queen there she said
And such NICE Common people
People say the country labourers are getting disrespectful nowadays
It isnt sonot if theyre properly treated
Here of course in Beckenham its different
I wont call the people we get here a Poortheyre certainly not a proper Poor
Theyre Masses
I always tell Mr Bugshoot theyre Masses and ought to be treated as such
Dim memories of Mrs Mackridge floated through my mind as I listened to her
I was whirled on this roundabout for a bit and then had the fortune to fall off into a teteatete with a lady whom my aunt introduced as Mrs Mumblebut then she introduced everybody to me as Mumble that afternoon either by way of humour or necessity
That must have been one of my earliest essays in the art of polite conversation and I remember that I began by criticising the local railway service and that at the third sentence or thereabouts Mrs Mumble said in a distinctly bright and encouraging way that she feared I was a very frivolous person
I wonder now what it was I said that was frivolous
I dont know what happened to end that conversation or if it had an end
I remember talking to one of the clergy for a time rather awkwardly and being given a sort of topographical history of Beckenham which he assured me time after time was Quite an old place
Quite an old place
As though I had treated it as new and he meant to be very patient but very convincing
Then we hung up in a distinct pause and my aunt rescued me
George she said in a confidential undertone keep the pot aboiling
And then audibly I say will you both old trot about with tea a bit
Only too delighted to TROT for you Mrs Ponderevo said the clergyman becoming fearfully expert and in his elements only too delighted
I found we were near a rustic table and that the housemaid was behind us in a suitable position to catch us on the rebound with the tea things
Trot
repeated the clergyman to me much amused excellent expression
And I just saved him from the tray as he turned about
We handed tea for a while Give em cakes said my aunt flushed but well in hand
Helps em to talk George
Always talk best after a little nourishment
Like throwing a bit of turf down an old geyser
She surveyed the gathering with a predominant blue eye and helped herself to tea
They keep on going stiff she said in an undertone Ive done my best
Its been a huge success I said encouragingly
That boy has had his legs crossed in that position and hasnt spoken for ten minutes
Stiffer and stiffer
Brittle
Hes beginning a dry coughalways a bad sign George
Walk em about shall Irub their noses with snow
Happily she didnt
I got myself involved with the gentlewoman from next door a pensive languidlooking little woman with a low voice and fell talking our topic Cats and Dogs and which it was we liked best
I always feel said the pensive little woman that theres something about a dog A cat hasnt got it
Yes I found myself admitting with great enthusiasm there is something
And yet again Oh
I know theres something about a cat too
But it isnt the same
Not quite the same I admitted but still its something
Ah
But such a different something
More sinuous
Much more
Ever so much more
It makes all the difference dont you think
Yes I said ALL
She glanced at me gravely and sighed a long deeply felt Yes
A long pause
The thing seemed to me to amount to a stalemate
Fear came into my heart and much perplexity
TheerRoses I said
I felt like a drowning man
Those rosesdont you think they arevery beautiful flowers
Arent they
she agreed gently
There seems to be something in rosessomethingI dont know how to express it
Something I said helpfully
Yes she said something
Isnt there
So few people see it I said mores the pity
She sighed and said again very softly Yes
There was another long pause
I looked at her and she was thinking dreamily
The drowning sensation returned the fear and enfeeblement
I perceived by a sort of inspiration that her teacup was empty
Let me take your cup I said abruptly and that secured made for the table by the summerhouse
I had no intention then of deserting my aunt
But close at hand the big French window of the drawingroom yawned inviting and suggestive
I can feel all that temptation now and particularly the provocation of my collar
In an instant I was lost
I wouldJust for a moment
I dashed in put down the cup on the keys of the grand piano and fled upstairs softly swiftly three steps at a time to the sanctuary of my uncles study his snuggery
I arrived there breathless convinced there was no return for me
I was very glad and ashamed of myself and desperate
By means of a penknife I contrived to break open his cabinet of cigars drew a chair to the window took off my coat collar and tie and remained smoking guiltily and rebelliously and peeping through the blind at the assembly on the lawn until it was altogether gone
The clergymen I thought were wonderful
III A few such pictures of those early days at Beckenham stand out and then I find myself among the Chiselhurst memories
The Chiselhurst mansion had grounds rather than a mere garden and there was a gardeners cottage and a little lodge at the gate
The ascendant movement was always far more in evidence there than at Beckenham
The velocity was increasing One night picks itself out as typical as in its way marking an epoch
I was there I think about some advertisement stuff on some sort of business anyhow and my uncle and aunt had come back in a fly from a dinner at the Runcorns
Even there he was nibbling at Runcorn with the idea of our great Amalgamation budding in his mind
I got down there I suppose about eleven
I found the two of them sitting in the study my aunt on a chairarm with a whimsical pensiveness on her face regarding my uncle and he much extended and very rotund in the low armchair drawn up to the fender
Look here George said my uncle after my first greetings
I just been saying We arent Oh Fay
Eh
Not Oh Fay
Socially
Old FLY he means GeorgeFrench
Oh
Didnt think of French
One never knows where to have him
Whats gone wrong tonight
I been thinking
It isnt any particular thing
I ate too much of that fishy stuff at first like salt frog spawn and was a bit confused by olives andwell I didnt know which wine was which
Had to say THAT each time
It puts your talk all wrong
And she wasnt in evening dress not like the others
We cant go on in that style Georgenot a proper ad
Im not sure you were right I said in having a fly
We got to do it all better said my uncle we got to do it in Style
Smart business smart men
She tries to pass it off as humorousmy aunt pulled a grimace it isnt humorous
See
Were on the upgrade now fair and square
Were going to be big
We arent going to be laughed at as Poovenoos see
Nobody laughed at you said my aunt
Old Bladder
Nobody isnt going to laugh at me said my uncle glancing at his contours and suddenly sitting up
My aunt raised her eyebrows slightly swung her foot and said nothing
We arent keeping pace with our own progress George
We got to
Were bumping against new people and they set up to be gentlefolksetiquette dinners and all the rest of it
They give themselves airs and expect us to be fishoutofwater
We arent going to be
They think weve no Style
Well we give them Style for our advertisements and were going to give em Style all through You neednt be born to it to dance well on the wires of the Bond Street tradesmen
See
I handed him the cigarbox
Runcorn hadnt cigars like these he said truncating one lovingly
We beat him at cigars
Well beat him all round
My aunt and I regarded him full of apprehensions
I got idees he said darkly to the cigar deepening our dread
He pocketed his cigarcutter and spoke again
We got to learn all the rotten little game first
See Frinstance we got to get samples of all the blessed wines there areand learn em up
Stern Smoor Burgundy all of em
She took Stern tonightand when she tasted it firstyou pulled a face Susan you did
I saw you
It surprised you
You bunched your nose
We got to get used to wine and not do that
We got to get used to wearing evening dressYOU Susan too
Always have had a tendency to stick out of my clothes said my aunt
HoweverWho cares
She shrugged her shoulders
I had never seen my uncle so immensely serious
Got to get the hang of etiquette he went on to the fire
Horses even
Practise everything
Dine every night in evening dress Get a brougham or something
Learn up golf and tennis and things
Country gentleman
Oh Fay
It isnt only freedom from Goochery
Eh
I said
OhGawshery if you like
French George said my aunt
But IM not ol Gooch
I made that face for fun
It isnt only freedom from Gawshery
We got to have Style
See
Style
Just all right and one better
Thats what I call Style
We can do it and we will
He mumbled his cigar and smoked for a space leaning forward and looking into the fire
What is it he asked after all
What is it
Tips about eating tips about drinking
Clothes
How to hold yourself and not say jes the few little things they know for certain are wrongjes the shibboleth things
He was silent again and the cigar crept up from the horizontal towards the zenith as the confidence of his mouth increased
Learn the whole bag of tricks in six months
he said becoming more cheerful
Ah Susan
Beat it out
George you in particular ought to get hold of it
Ought to get into a good club and all that
Always ready to learn
I said
Ever since you gave me the chance of Latin
So far we dont seem to have hit upon any Latinspeaking stratum in the population
Weve come to French said my aunt anyhow
Its a very useful language said my uncle
Put a point on things
Zzzz
As for accent no Englishman has an accent
No Englishman pronounces French properly
Dont you tell ME
Its a BluffIts all a Bluff
Lifes a Bluffpractically
Thats why its so important Susan for us to attend to Style
Le Steel Say Lum
The Style its the man
Whad you laughing at Susan
George youre not smoking
These cigars are good for the mind What do YOU think of it all
We got to adapt ourselves
We haveso far Not going to be beat by these silly things
IV What do you think of it George
he insisted
What I said I thought of it I dont now recall
Only I have very distinctly the impression of meeting for a moment my aunts impenetrable eye
And anyhow he started in with his accustomed energy to rape the mysteries of the Costly Life and become the calmest of its lords
On the whole I think he did itthoroughly
I have crowded memories a little difficult to disentangle of his experimental stages his experimental proceedings
Its hard at times to say which memory comes in front of which
I recall him as presenting on the whole a series of small surprises as being again and again unexpectedly a little more selfconfident a little more polished a little richer and finer a little more aware of the positions and values of things and men
There was a timeit must have been very earlywhen I saw him deeply impressed by the splendours of the diningroom of the National Liberal Club
Heaven knows who our host was or what that particular little feed was about nowall that sticks is the impression of our straggling entry a string of six or seven guests and my uncle looking about him at the numerous bright redshaded tables at the exotics in great Majolica jars at the shining ceramic columns and pilasters at the impressive portraits of Liberal statesmen and heroes and all that contributes to the ensemble of that palatial spectacle
He was betrayed into a whisper to me This is all Right George
he said
That artless comment seems almost incredible as I set it down there came a time so speedily when not even the clubs of New York could have overawed my uncle and when he could walk through the bowing magnificence of the Royal Grand Hotel to his chosen table in that aggressively exquisite gallery upon the river with all the easy calm of one of earths legitimate kings
The two of them learnt the new game rapidly and well they experimented abroad they experimented at home
At Chiselhurst with the aid of a new very costly but highly instructive cook they tried over everything they heard of that roused their curiosity and had any reputation for difficulty from asparagus to plovers eggs
They afterwards got a gardener who could wait at tableand he brought the soil home to one
Then there came a butler
I remember my aunts first dinnergown very brightly and how she stood before the fire in the drawingroom confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed and looking over her shoulder at herself in a mirror
A ham she remarked reflectively must feel like this
Just a necklace
I attempted I think some commonplace compliment
My uncle appeared at the door in a white waistcoat and with his hands in his trouser pockets he halted and surveyed her critically
Couldnt tell you from a duchess Susan he remarked
Id like to have you painted standin at the fire like that
Sargent
You lookspirited somehow
LordI wish some of those damned tradesmen at Wimblehurst could see you
They did a lot of weekending at hotels and sometimes I went down with them
We seemed to fall into a vast drifting crowd of social learners
I dont know whether it is due simply to my changed circumstances but it seems to me there have been immensely disproportionate developments of the hotelfrequenting and restaurantusing population during the last twenty years
It is not only I think that there are crowds of people who like we were are in the economically ascendant phase but whole masses of the prosperous section of the population must be altering its habits giving up hightea for dinner and taking to evening dress using the weekend hotels as a practiseground for these new social arts
A swift and systematic conversion to gentility has been going on I am convinced throughout the whole commercial uppermiddle class since I was twentyone
Curiously mixed was the personal quality of the people one saw in these raids
There were conscientiously refined and lowvoiced people reeking with proud bashfulness there were aggressively smart people using pet diminutives for each other loudly and seeking fresh occasions for brilliant rudeness there were awkward husbands and wives quarrelling furtively about their manners and ill at ease under the eye of the winter cheerfully amiable and often discrepant couples with a disposition to inconspicuous corners and the jolly sort affecting an unaffected ease plump happy ladies who laughed too loud and gentlemen in evening dress who subsequently got their pipes
And nobody you knew was anybody however expensively they dressed and whatever rooms they took
I look back now with a curious remoteness of spirit to those crowded diningrooms with their dispersed tables and their inevitable redshaded lights and the unsympathetic unskillful waiters and the choice of Thig or Glear Sir
Ive not dined in that way in that sort of place now for five yearsit must be quite five years so specialised and narrow is my life becoming
My uncles earlier motorcar phases work in with these associations and there stands out a little bright vignette of the hall of the Magnificent BexhillonSea and people dressed for dinner and sitting about amidst the scarlet furnituresatin and whiteenameled woodwork until the gong should gather them and my aunt is there very marvelously wrapped about in a dust cloak and a cagelike veil and there are hotel porters and underporters very alert and an obsequious manager and the tall young lady in black from the office is surprised into admiration and in the middle of the picture is my uncle making his first appearance in that Esquimaux costume I have already mentioned a short figure compactly immense hugely goggled wearing a sort of brown rubber proboscis and surmounted by a tableland of motoring cap
V So it was we recognised our new needs as fresh invaders of the upper levels of the social system and set ourselves quite consciously to the acquisition of Style and Savoir Faire
We became part of what is nowadays quite an important element in the confusion of our world that multitude of economically ascendant people who are learning how to spend money
It is made up of financial people the owners of the businesses that are eating up their competitors inventors of new sources of wealth such as ourselves it includes nearly all America as one sees it on the European stage
It is a various multitude having only this in common they are all moving and particularly their womankind are moving from conditions in which means were insistently finite things were few and customs simple towards a limitless expenditure and the sphere of attraction of Bond Street Fifth Avenue and Paris
Their general effect is one of progressive revolution of limitless rope
They discover suddenly indulgences their moral code never foresaw and has no provision for elaborations ornaments possessions beyond their wildest dreams
With an immense astonished zest they begin shopping begin a systematic adaptation to a new life crowded and brilliant with things shopped with jewels maids butlers coachmen electric broughams hired town and country houses
They plunge into it as one plunges into a career as a class they talk think and dream possessions
Their literature their Press turns all on that immense illustrated weeklies of unsurpassed magnificence guide them in domestic architecture in the art of owning a garden in the achievement of the sumptuous in motorcars in an elaborate sporting equipment in the purchase and control of their estates in travel and stupendous hotels
Once they begin to move they go far and fast
Acquisition becomes the substance of their lives
They find a world organised to gratify that passion
In a brief year or so they are connoisseurs
They join in the plunder of the eighteenth century buy rare old books fine old pictures good old furniture
Their first crude conception of dazzling suites of the newly perfect is replaced almost from the outset by a jackdaw dream of accumulating costly discrepant old things
I seem to remember my uncle taking to shopping quite suddenly
In the Beckenham days and in the early Chiselhurst days he was chiefly interested in getting money and except for his onslaught on the Beckenham house bothered very little about his personal surroundings and possessions
I forget now when the change came and he began to spend
Some accident must have revealed to him this new source of power or some subtle shifting occurred in the tissues of his brain
He began to spend and shop
So soon as he began to shop he began to shop violently
He began buying pictures and then oddly enough old clocks
For the Chiselhurst house he bought nearly a dozen grandfather clocks and three copper warming pans
After that he bought much furniture
Then he plunged into art patronage and began to commission pictures and to make presents to churches and institutions
His buying increased with a regular acceleration
Its development was a part of the mental changes that came to him in the wild excitements of the last four years of his ascent
Towards the climax he was a furious spender he shopped with large unexpected purchases he shopped like a mind seeking expression he shopped to astonish and dismay shopped crescendo shopped fortissimo con molto espressione until the magnificent smash of Crest Hill eroded his shopping for ever
Always it was he who shopped
My aunt did not shine as a purchaser
It is a curious thing due to I know not what fine strain in her composition that my aunt never set any great store upon possessions
She plunged through that crowded bazaar of Vanity Fair during those feverish years spending no doubt freely and largely but spending with detachment and a touch of humorous contempt for the things even the old things that money can buy
It came to me suddenly one afternoon just how detached she was as I saw her going towards the Hardingham sitting up as she always did rather stiffly in her electric brougham regarding the glittering world with interested and ironically innocent blue eyes from under the brim of a hat that defied comment
No one I thought would sit so apart if she hadnt dreamsand what are her dreams
Id never thought
And I remember too an outburst of scornful description after she had lunched with a party of women at the Imperial Cosmic Club
She came round to my rooms on the chance of finding me there and I gave her tea
She professed herself tired and cross and flung herself into my chair George she cried  the Things women are
Do I stink of money
Lunching
I asked
She nodded
Plutocratic ladies
Yes
Oriental type
Oh
Like a burst hareem
Bragging of possessions
They feel you
They feel your clothes George to see if they are good
I soothed her as well as I could
They ARE Good arent they
I said
Its the old pawnshop in their blood she said drinking tea and then in infinite disgust They run their hands over your clothesthey paw you
I had a moment of doubt whether perhaps she had not been discovered in possession of unsuspected forgeries
I dont know
After that my eyes were quickened and I began to see for myself women running their hands over other womens furs scrutinising their lace even demanding to handle jewelry appraising envying testing
They have a kind of etiquette
The woman who feels says What beautiful sables
What lovely lace
The woman felt admits proudly Its Real you know or disavows pretension modestly and hastily Its Rot Good
In each others houses they peer at the pictures handle the selvage of hangings look at the bottoms of china
I wonder if it IS the old pawnshop in the blood
I doubt if Lady Drew and the Olympians did that sort of thing but here I may be only clinging to another of my former illusions about aristocracy and the State
Perhaps always possessions have been Booty and never anywhere has there been such a thing as house and furnishings native and natural to the women and men who made use of them VI For me at least it marked an epoch in my uncles career when I learnt one day that he had shopped Lady Grove
I realised a fresh wide unpreluded step
He took me by surprise with the sudden change of scale from such portable possessions as jewels and motorcars to a stretch of countryside
The transaction was Napoleonic he was told of the place he said snap there were no preliminary desirings or searchings
Then he came home and said what he had done
Even my aunt was for a day or so measurably awestricken by this exploit in purchase and we both went down with him to see the house in a mood near consternation
It struck us then as a very lordly place indeed
I remember the three of us standing on the terrace that looked westward surveying the skyreflecting windows of the house and a feeling of unwarrantable intrusion comes back to me
Lady Grove you know is a very beautiful house indeed a still and gracious place whose agelong seclusion was only effectively broken with the toot of the coming of the motorcar
An old Catholic family had died out in it century by century and was now altogether dead
Portions of the fabric are thirteenth century and its last architectural revision was Tudor within it is for the most part dark and chilly save for two or three favoured rooms and its tallwindowed oakgalleried hall
Its terrace is its noblest feature a very wide broad lawn it is bordered by a low stone battlement and there is a great cedar in one corner under whose level branches one looks out across the blue distances of the Weald blue distances that are made extraordinarily Italian in quality by virtue of the dark masses of that single tree
It is a very high terrace southward one looks down upon the tops of wayfaring trees and spruces and westward on a steep slope of beechwood through which the road comes
One turns back to the still old house and sees a grey and lichenous facade with a very finely arched entrance
It was warmed by the afternoon light and touched with the colour of a few neglected roses and a pyracanthus
It seemed to me that the most modern owner conceivable in this serene fine place was some bearded scholarly man in a black cassock gentlevoiced and whitehanded or some very softrobed grey gentlewoman
And there was my uncle holding his goggles in a sealskin glove wiping the glass with a pockethandkerchief and asking my aunt if Lady Grove wasnt a Bit of all Right
My aunt made him no answer
The man who built this I speculated wore armour and carried a sword
Theres some of it inside still said my uncle
We went inside
An old woman with very white hair was in charge of the place and cringed rather obviously to the new master
She evidently found him a very strange and frightful apparition indeed and was dreadfully afraid of him
But if the surviving present bowed down to us the past did not
We stood up to the dark long portraits of the extinguished raceone was a Holbeinand looked them in their sidelong eyes
They looked back at us
We all I know felt the enigmatical quality in them
Even my uncle was momentarily embarrassed I think by that invincibly selfcomplacent expression
It was just as though after all he had not bought them up and replaced them altogether as though that secretly they knew better and could smile at him
The spirit of the place was akin to Bladesover but touched with something older and remoter
That armour that stood about had once served in tiltyards if indeed it had not served in battle and this family had sent its blood and treasure time after time upon the most romantic quest in history to Palestine
Dreams loyalties place and honour how utterly had it all evaporated leaving at last the final expression of its spirit these quaint painted smiles these smiles of triumphant completion
It had evaporated indeed long before the ultimate Durgan had died and in his old age he had cumbered the place with Early Victorian cushions and carpets and tapestry tablecloths and invalid appliances of a type even more extinct it seemed to us than the crusades
Yes it was different from Bladesover
Bit stuffy George said my uncle
They hadnt much idea of ventilation when this was built
One of the panelled rooms was halffilled with presses and a fourposter bed
Might be the ghost room said my uncle but it did not seem to me that so retiring a family as the Durgans so old and completely exhausted a family as the Durgans was likely to haunt anybody
What living thing now had any concern with their honour and judgments and good and evil deeds
Ghosts and witchcraft were a later innovationthat fashion came from Scotland with the Stuarts
Afterwards prying for epitaphs we found a marble crusader with a broken nose under a battered canopy of fretted stone outside the restricted limits of the present Duffield church and half buried in nettles
Ichabod said my uncle
Eh
We shall be like that Susan some day
Im going to clean him up a bit and put a railing to keep off the children
Old saved at the eleventh hour said my aunt quoting one of the less successful advertisements of TonoBungay
But I dont think my uncle heard her
It was by our captured crusader that the vicar found us
He came round the corner at us briskly a little out of breath
He had an air of having been running after us since the first toot of our horn had warned the village of our presence
He was an Oxford man cleanshaven with a cadaverous complexion and a guardedly respectful manner a cultivated intonation and a general air of accommodation to the new order of things
These Oxford men are the Greeks of our plutocratic empire
He was a Tory in spirit and what one may call an adapted Tory by stress of circumstances that is to say he was no longer a legitimist he was prepared for the substitution of new lords for old
We were pill vendors he knew and no doubt horribly vulgar in soul but then it might have been some polygamous Indian rajah a great strain on a good mans tact or some Jew with an inherited expression of contempt
Anyhow we were English and neither Dissenters nor Socialists and he was cheerfully prepared to do what he could to make gentlemen of both of us
He might have preferred Americans for some reasons they are not so obviously taken from one part of the social system and dumped down in another and they are more teachable but in this world we cannot always be choosers
So he was very bright and pleasant with us showed us the church gossiped informingly about our neighbours on the countrysideTux the banker Lord Boom the magazine and newspaper proprietor Lord Carnaby that great sportsman and old Lady Osprey
And finally he took us by way of a village lanethree children bobbed convulsively with eyes of terror for my unclethrough a meticulous garden to a big slovenly Vicarage with faded Victorian furniture and a faded Victorian wife who gave us tea and introduced us to a confusing family dispersed among a lot of disintegrating basket chairs upon the edge of a wellused tennis lawn
These people interested me
They were a common type no doubt but they were new to me
There were two lank sons who had been playing singles at tennis redeared youths growing black moustaches and dressed in conscientiously untidy tweeds and unbuttoned and ungirt Norfolk jackets
There were a number of illnourishedlooking daughters sensible and economical in their costume the younger still with long brownstockinged legs and the eldest presentthere were we discovered one or two hidden awaydisplaying a large gold cross and other aggressive ecclesiastical symbols there were two or three foxterriers a retrieverish mongrel and an old bloodyeyed and very evilsmelling St Bernard
There was a jackdaw
There was moreover an ambiguous silent lady that my aunt subsequently decided must be a very deaf paying guest
Two or three other people had concealed themselves at our coming and left unfinished teas behind them
Rugs and cushions lay among the chairs and two of the latter were I noted covered with Union Jacks
The vicar introduced us sketchily and the faded Victorian wife regarded my aunt with a mixture of conventional scorn and abject respect and talked to her in a languid persistent voice about people in the neighbourhood whom my aunt could not possibly know
My aunt received these personalia cheerfully with her blue eyes flitting from point to point and coming back again and again to the pinched faces of the daughters and the cross upon the eldests breast
Encouraged by my aunts manner the vicars wife grew patronising and kindly and made it evident that she could do much to bridge the social gulf between ourselves and the people of family about us
I had just snatches of that conversation
Mrs Merridew brought him quite a lot of money
Her father I believe had been in the Spanish wine tradequite a lady though
And after that he fell off his horse and cracked his brain pan and took to fishing and farming
Im sure youll like to know them
Hes most amusing
The daughter had a disappointment and went to China as a missionary and got mixed up in a massacre
The most beautiful silks and things she brought back youd hardly believe
Yes they gave them to propitiate her
You see they didnt understand the difference and they thought that as theyd been massacring people THEYD be massacred
They didnt understand the difference Christianity makes
Seven bishops theyve had in the family
Married a Papist and was quite lost to them
He failed some dreadful examination and had to go into the militia
So she bit his leg as hard as ever she could and he let go
Had four of his ribs amputated
Caught meningitis and was carried off in a week
Had to have a large piece of silver tube let into his throat and if he wants to talk he puts his finger on it
It makes him so interesting I think
You feel hes sincere somehow
A most charming man in every way
Preserved them both in spirits very luckily and there they are in his study though of course he doesnt show them to everybody
The silent lady unperturbed by these apparently exciting topics scrutinised my aunts costume with a singular intensity and was visibly moved when she unbuttoned her dust cloak and flung it wide
Meanwhile we men conversed one of the more spirited daughters listened brightly and the youths lay on the grass at our feet
My uncle offered them cigars but they both declinedout of bashfulness it seemed to me whereas the vicar I think accepted out of tact
When we were not looking at them directly these young men would kick each other furtively
Under the influence of my uncles cigar the vicars mind had soared beyond the limits of the district
This Socialism he said seems making great headway
My uncle shook his head
Were too individualistic in this country for that sort of nonsense he said Everybodys business is nobodys business
Thats where they go wrong
They have some intelligent people in their ranks I am told said the vicar writers and so forth
Quite a distinguished playwright my eldest daughter was telling meI forget his name
Milly dear
Oh
shes not here
Painters too they have
This Socialist it seems to me is part of the Unrest of the Age
But as you say the spirit of the people is against it
In the country at any rate
The people down here are too sturdily independent in their small wayand too sensible altogether
Its a great thing for Duffield to have Lady Grove occupied again he was saying when my wandering attention came back from some attractive casualty in his wifes discourse
People have always looked up to the house and considering all things old Mr Durgan really was extraordinarily goodextraordinarily good
You intend to give us a good deal of your time here I hope
I mean to do my duty by the Parish said my uncle
Im sincerely glad to hear itsincerely
Weve missedthe house influence
An English village isnt completePeople get out of hand
Life grows dull
The young people drift away to London
He enjoyed his cigar gingerly for a moment
We shall look to you to liven things up he said poor man
My uncle cocked his cigar and removed it from his mouth
What you think the place wants
he asked
He did not wait for an answer
I been thinking while you been talkingthings one might do
Cricketa good English gamesports
Build the chaps a pavilion perhaps
Then every village ought to have a miniature rifle range
Yeees said the vicar
Provided of course there isnt a constant popping
Manage that all right said my uncle
Thingd be a sort of long shed
Paint it red
British colour
Then theres a Union Jack for the church and the village school
Paint the school red too praps
Not enough colour about now
Too grey
Then a maypole
How far our people would take up that sort of thing began the vicar
Im all for getting that good old English spirit back again said my uncle
Merrymakings
Lads and lasses dancing on the village green
Harvest home
Fairings
Yule Logall the rest of it
How would old Sally Glue do for a May Queen
asked one of the sons in the slight pause that followed
Or Annie Glassbound
said the other with the huge virile guffaw of a young man whose voice has only recently broken
Sally Glue is eightyfive explained the vicar and Annie Glassbound is wella young lady of extremely generous proportions
And not quite right you know
Not quite righthere
He tapped his brow
Generous proportions
said the eldest son and the guffaws were renewed
You see said the vicar all the brisker girls go into service in or near London
The life of excitement attracts them
And no doubt the higher wages have something to do with it
And the liberty to wear finery
And generallyfreedom from restraint
So that there might be a little diffculty perhaps to find a May Queen here just at present who was really young and er pretty Of course I couldnt think of any of my girlsor anything of that sort
We got to attract em back said my uncle
Thats what I feel about it
We got to BuckUp the country
The English country is a going concern still just as the Established Churchif youll excuse me saying it is a going concern
Just as Oxford isor Cambridge
Or any of those old fine old things
Only it wants fresh capital fresh idees and fresh methods
Light railways frinstancescientific use of drainage
Wire fencing machineryall that
The vicars face for one moment betrayed dismay
Perhaps he was thinking of his country walks amids the hawthorns and honeysuckle
Theres great things said my uncle to be done on Modun lines with Village Jam and Picklesboiled in the country
It was the reverberation of this last sentence in my mind I think that sharpened my sentimental sympathy as we went through the straggling village street and across the trim green on our way back to London
It seemed that afternoon the most tranquil and idyllic collection of creepersheltered homes you can imagine thatch still lingered on a whitewashed cottage or two pyracanthus wallflowers and daffodils abounded and an unsystematic orchard or so was white with blossom above and gay with bulbs below
I noted a row of straw beehives beehiveshaped beehives of the type long since condemned as inefficient by all progressive minds and in the doctors acre of grass a flock of two whole sheep was grazingno doubt hed taken them on account
Two men and one old woman made gestures of abject vassalage and my uncle replied with a lordly gesture of his great motoring glove Englands full of Bits like this said my uncle leaning over the front seat and looking back with great satisfaction
The black glare of his goggles rested for a time on the receding turrets of Lady Grove just peeping over the trees
I shall have a flagstaff I think he considered
Then one could show when one is in residence
The villagers will like to know
I reflected
They will I said
Theyre used to liking to know
My aunt had been unusually silent
Suddenly she spoke
He says Snap she remarked he buys that place
And a nice old job of Housekeeping he gives me
He sails through the village swelling like an old turkey
And wholl have to scoot the butler
Me
Whos got to forget all she ever knew and start again
Me
Whos got to trek from Chiselhurst and be a great lady
Me
 You old Bother
Just when I was settling down and beginning to feel at home
My uncle turned his goggles to her
Ah
THIS time it is home Susan We got there
VII It seems to me now but a step from the buying of Lady Grove to the beginning of Crest Hill from the days when the former was a stupendous achievement to the days when it was too small and dark and inconvenient altogether for a great financiers use
For me that was a period of increasing detachment from our business and the great world of London I saw it more and more in broken glimpses and sometimes I was working in my little pavilion above Lady Grove for a fortnight together even when I came up it was often solely for a meeting of the aeronautical society or for one of the learned societies or to consult literature or employ searchers or some such special business
For my uncle it was a period of stupendous inflation
Each time I met him I found him more confident more comprehensive more consciously a factor in great affairs
Soon he was no longer an associate of merely business men he was big enough for the attentions of greater powers
I grew used to discovering some item of personal news about him in my evening paper or to the sight of a fullpage portrait of him in a sixpenny magazine
Usually the news was of some munificent act some romantic piece of buying or giving or some fresh rumour of reconstruction
He saved you will remember the Parbury Reynolds for the country
Or at times it would be an interview or my uncles contribution to some symposium on the Secret of Success or suchlike topic
Or wonderful tales of his power of work of his wonderful organisation to get things done of his instant decisions and remarkable power of judging his fellowmen
They repeated his great mot Eight hour working dayI want eighty hours
He became modestly but resolutely public
They cartooned him in Vanity Fair
One year my aunt looking indeed a very gracious slender lady faced the portrait of the King in the great room at Burlington House and the next year saw a medallion of my uncle by Ewart looking out upon the world proud and imperial but on the whole a trifle too prominently convex from the walls of the New Gallery
I shared only intermittently in his social experiences
People knew of me it is true and many of them sought to make through me a sort of flank attack upon him and there was a legend owing very unreasonably partly to my growing scientific reputation and partly to an element of reserve in my manner that I played a much larger share in planning his operations than was actually the case
This led to one or two very intimate private dinners to my inclusion in one or two house parties and various odd offers of introductions and services that I didnt for the most part accept
Among other people who sought me in this way was Archie Garvell now a smart impecunious soldier of no particular distinction who would I think have been quite prepared to develop any sporting instincts I possessed and who was beautifully unaware of our former contact
He was always offering me winners no doubt in a spirit of anticipatory exchange for some really good thing in our more scientific and certain method of getting something for nothing
In spite of my preoccupation with my experiments work I did I find now that I come to ransack my impressions see a great deal of the great world during those eventful years I had a near view of the machinery by which an astounding Empire is run rubbed shoulders and exchanged experiences with bishops and statesmen political women and women who were not political physicians and soldiers artists and authors the directors of great journals philanthropists and all sorts of eminent significant people
I saw the statesmen without their orders and the bishops with but a little purple silk left over from their canonicals inhaling not incensen but cigar smoke
I could look at them all the better because for the most part they were not looking at me but at my uncle and calculating consciously or unconsciously how they might use him and assimilate him to their system the most unpremeditated subtle successful and aimless plutocracy that ever encumbered the destinies of mankind
Not one of them so far as I could see until disaster overtook him resented his lies his almost naked dishonesty of method the disorderly disturbance of this trade and that caused by his spasmodic operations
I can see them now about him see them polite watchful various his stiff compact little figure always a centre of attention his wiry hair his brief nose his underlip electric with selfconfidence
Wandering marginally through distinguished gatherings I would catch the whispers Thats Mr
Ponderevo
The little man
Yes the little bounder with the glasses
They say hes made Or I would see him on some parterre of a platform beside my aunts hurraying hat amidst titles and costumes holding his end up as he would say subscribing heavily to obvious charities even at times making brief convulsive speeches in some good cause before the most exalted audiences
Mr Chairman your Royal Highness my Lords Ladies and Gentlemenhe would begin amidst subsiding applause and adjust those obstinate glasses and thrust back the wings of his frockcoat and rest his hands upon his hips and speak his fragment with ever and again an incidental Zzzz
His hands would fret about him as he spoke fiddle his glasses feel in his waistcoat pockets ever and again he would rise slowly to his toes as a sentence unwound jerkily like a clockwork snake and drop back on his heels at the end
They were the very gestures of our first encounter when he had stood before the empty fireplace in his minute draped parlour and talked of my future to my mother
In those measurelessly long hot afternoons in the little shop at Wimblehurst he had talked and dreamt of the Romance of Modern Commerce
Here surely was his romance come true
VIII People say that my uncle lost his head at the crest of his fortunes but if one may tell so much truth of a man one has in a manner loved he never had very much head to lose
He was always imaginative erratic inconsistent recklessly inexact and his inundation of wealth merely gave him scope for these qualities
It is true indeed that towards the climax he became intensely irritable at times and impatient of contradiction but that I think was rather the gnawing uneasiness of sanity than any mental disturbance
But I find it hard either to judge him or convey the full development of him to the reader
I saw too much of him my memory is choked with disarranged moods and aspects
Now he is distended with megalomania now he is deflated now he is quarrelsome now impenetrably selfsatisfied but always he is sudden jerky fragmentary energetic andin some subtle fundamental way that I find difficult to defineabsurd
There stands outbecause of the tranquil beauty of its setting perhapsa talk we had in the veranda of the little pavilion near my worksheds behind Crest Hill in which my aeroplanes and navigable balloons were housed
It was one of many similar conversations and I do not know why it in particular should survive its fellows
It happens so
He had come up to me after his coffee to consult me about a certain chalice which in a moment of splendour and under the importunity of a countess he had determined to give to a deserving church in the eastend
I in a moment of even rasher generosity had suggested Ewart as a possible artist
Ewart had produced at once an admirable sketch for the sacred vessel surrounded by a sort of wreath of Millies with open arms and wings and had drawn fifty pounds on the strength of it
After that came a series of vexatious delays
The chalice became less and less of a commercial mans chalice acquired more and more the elusive quality of the Holy Grail and at last even the drawing receded
My uncle grew restiveYou see George theyll begin to want the blasted thing
What blasted thing
That chalice damn it
Theyre beginning to ask questions
It isnt Business George
Its art I protested and religion
Thats all very well
But its not a good ad for us George to make a promise and not deliver the goods
Ill have to write off your friend Ewart as a bad debt thats what it comes to and go to a decent firm
We sat outside on deck chairs in the veranda of the pavilion smoked drank whisky and the chalice disposed of meditated
His temporary annoyance passed
It was an altogether splendid summer night following a blazing indolent day
Full moonlight brought out dimly the lines of the receding hills one wave beyond another far beyond were the pinpoint lights of Leatherhead and in the foreground the little stage from which I used to start upon my gliders gleamed like wet steel
The season must have been high June for down in the woods that hid the lights of the Lady Grove windows I remember the nightingales thrilled and gurgled We got here George said my uncle ending a long pause
Didnt I say
Saywhen
I asked
In that hole in the Tonem Court Road eh
Its been a Straight Square Fight and here we are
I nodded
Member me telling youTonoBungay
Well
Id just that afternoon thought of it
Ive fancied at times I admitted
Its a great world George nowadays with a fair chance for every one who lays hold of things
The career ouvert to the Talonseh
TonoBungay
Think of it
Its a great world and a growing world and Im glad were in itand getting a pull
Were getting big people George
Things come to us
Eh
This Palestine thing
He meditated for a time and Zzzzed softly
Then he became still
His theme was taken up by a cricket in the grass until he himself was ready to resume it
The cricket too seemed to fancy that in some scheme of its own it had got there
Chirrrrrrup it said chirrrrrrup
Lord what a place that was at Wimblehurst
he broke out
If ever I get a day off well motor there George and run over that dog that sleeps in the High Street
Always was a dog asleep therealways
Always
Id like to see the old shop again
I daresay old Ruck still stands between the sheep at his door grinning with all his teeth and Marbel silly beggar
comes out with his white apron on and a pencil stuck behind his ear trying to look awake Wonder if they know its me
Id like em somehow to know its me
Theyll have had the International Tea Company and all sorts of people cutting them up I said
And that dogs been on the pavement this six yearscant sleep even there poor dear because of the motorhorns and its shattered nerves
Movin everywhere said my uncle
I expect youre right
Its a big time were in George
Its a big Progressive Oncoming Imperial Time
This Palestine businessthe daring of it
Its its a Process George
And we got our hands on it
Here we sitwith our hands on it George
Entrusted
It seems quiet tonight
But if we could see and hear
He waved his cigar towards Leatherhead and London
There they are millions George
Jes think of what theyve been up to todaythose ten millionseach one doing his own particular job
You cant grasp it
Its like old Whitman sayswhat is it he says
Well anyway its like old Whitman
Fine chap Whitman
Fine old chap
Queer you cant quote him
 And these millions arent anything
Theres the millions over seas hundreds of millions Chinese Mrocco Africa generally Merica Well here we are with power with leisure picked outbecause weve been energetic because weve seized opportunities because weve made things hum when other people have waited for them to hum
See
Here we arewith our hands on it
Big people
Big growing people
In a sort of wayForces
He paused
Its wonderful George he said
AngloSaxon energy I said softly to the night
Thats it Georgeenergy
Its put things in our gripthreads wires stretching out and out George from that little office of ours out to West Africa out to Egypt out to Inja out east west north and south
Running the world practically
Running it faster and faster
Creative
Theres that Palestine canal affair
Marvellous idee
Suppose we take that up suppose we let ourselves in for it us and the others and run that water sluice from the Mediterranean into the Dead Sea Valleythink of the difference it will make
All the desert blooming like a rose Jericho lost for ever all the Holy Places under water
Very likely destroy Christianity
He mused for a space
Cuttin canals murmured my uncle
Making tunnels New countries New centres Zzzz Finance Not only Palestine
I wonder where we shall get before we done George
We got a lot of big things going
We got the investing public sound and sure
I dont see why in the end we shouldnt be very big
Theres diffculties but Im equal to them
Were still a bit soft in our bones but theyll harden all right
I suppose after all Im worth something like a million George cleared up and settled
If I got out of things now
Its a great time George a wonderful time
I glanced through the twilight at his convexity and I must confess it struck me that on the whole he wasnt particularly good value
We got our hands on things George us big people
We got to hang together George run the show
Join up with the old order like that millwheel of Kiplings
Finest thing he ever wrote George I jes been reading it again
Made me buy Lady Grove
Well we got to run the country George
Its ours
Make it a Scientific Organised Business Enterprise
Put idees into it
Lectrify it
Run the Press
Run all sorts of developments
All sorts of developments
I been talking to Lord Boom
I been talking to all sorts of people
Great things
Progress
The world on business lines
Only jes beginning
He fell into a deep meditation
He Zzzzed for a time and ceased
YES he said at last in the tone of a man who has at last emerged with ultimate solutions to the profoundest problems
What
I said after a seemly pause
My uncle hung fire for a moment and it seemed to me the fate of nations trembled in the balance
Then he spoke as one who speaks from the very bottom of his heartand I think it was the very bottom of his heart
Id jes like to drop into the Eastry Arms jes when all those beggars in the parlour are sittin down to whist Ruck and Marbel and all and give em ten minutes of my mind George
Straight from the shoulder
Jes exactly what I think of them
Its a little thing but Id like to do it jes once before I die
He rested on that for some time Zzzzing
Then he broke out at a new place in a tone of detached criticism
Theres Boom he reflected
Its a wonderful system this old British system George
Its staid and stable and yet it has a place for new men
We come up and take our places
Its almost expected
We take a hand
Thats where our Democracy differs from America
Over there a man succeeds all he gets is money
Here theres a system open to every onepractically Chaps like Boomcome from nowhere
His voice ceased
I reflected upon the spirit of his words
Suddenly I kicked my feet in the air rolled on my side and sat up suddenly on my deck chair with my legs down
You dont mean it
I said
Mean what George
Subscription to the party funds
Reciprocal advantage
Have we got to that
Whad you driving at George
You know
Theyd never do it man
Do what
he said feebly and Why shouldnt they
Theyd not even go to a baronetcy
NO
And yet of course theres Boom
And Collingshead and Gorver
Theyve done beer theyve done snippets
After all TonoBungayits not like a turf commission agent or anything like that
There have of course been some very gentlemanly commission agents
It isnt like a fool of a scientific man who cant make money
My uncle grunted wed differed on that issue before
A malignant humour took possession of me
What would they call you
I speculated
The vicar would like Duffield
Too much like Duffer
Difficult thing a title
I ran my mind over various possibilities
Why not take a leaf from a socialist tract I came upon yesterday
Chap says were all getting delocalised
Beautiful worddelocalised
Why not be the first delocalised peer
That gives youTonoBungay
There is a Bungay you know
Lord Tono of Bungayin bottles everywhere
Eh
My uncle astonished me by losing his temper
Damn it
George you dont seem to see Im serious
Youre always sneering at TonoBungay
As though it was some sort of swindle
It was perfecly legitimate trade perfecly legitimate
Good value and a good article
When I come up here and tell you plans and exchange ideesyou sneer at me
You do
You dont seeits a big thing
Its a big thing
You got to get used to new circumstances
You got to face what lies before us
You got to drop that tone
IX My uncle was not altogether swallowed up in business and ambition
He kept in touch with modern thought
For example he was I know greatly swayed by what he called This Overman idee Nietzscheall that stuff
He mingled those comforting suggestions of a potent and exceptional human being emancipated from the pettier limitations of integrity with the Napoleonic legend
It gave his imagination a considerable outlet
That Napoleonic legend
The real mischief of Napoleons immensely disastrous and accidental career began only when he was dead and the romantic type of mind was free to elaborate his character
I do believe that my uncle would have made a far less egregious smash if there had been no Napoleonic legend to misguide him
He was in many ways better and infinitely kinder than his career
But when in doubt between decent conduct and a base advantage that cult came in more and more influentially think of Napoleon think what the inflexiblywilful Napoleon would have done with such scruples as yours that was the rule and the end was invariably a new step in dishonour
My uncle was in an unsystematic way a collector of Napoleonic relics the bigger the book about his hero the more readily he bought it he purchased letters and tinsel and weapons that bore however remotely upon the Man of Destiny and he even secured in Geneva though he never brought home an old coach in which Buonaparte might have ridden he crowded the quiet walls of Lady Grove with engravings and figures of him preferring my aunt remarked the more convex portraits with the white vest and those statuettes with the hands behind the back which threw forward the figure
The Durgans watched him through it all sardonically
And he would stand after breakfast at times in the light of the window at Lady Grove a little apart with two fingers of one hand stuck between his waistcoatbuttons and his chin sunken thinkingthe most preposterous little fat man in the world
It made my aunt feel she said like an old Field Marshalknocks me into a cocked hat George
Perhaps this Napoleonic bias made him a little less frequent with his cigars than he would otherwise have been but of that I cannot be sure and it certainly caused my aunt a considerable amount of vexation after he had read Napoleon and the Fair Sex because for a time that roused him to a sense of a side of life he had in his commercial preoccupations very largely forgotten
Suggestion plays so great a part in this field
My uncle took the next opportunity and had an affair
It was not a very impassioned affair and the exact particulars never of course reached me
It is quite by chance I know anything of it at all
One evening I was surprised to come upon my uncle in a mixture of Bohemia and smart people at an At Home in the flat of Robbert the RA who painted my aunt and he was standing a little apart in a recess talking or rather being talked to in undertones by a plump blond little woman in pale blue a Helen Scrymgeour who wrote novels and was organising a weekly magazine
I elbowed a large lady who was saying something about them but I didnt need to hear the thing she said to perceive the relationship of the two
It hit me like a placard on a hoarding
I was amazed the whole gathering did not see it
Perhaps they did
She was wearing a remarkably fine diamond necklace much too fine for journalism and regarding him with that quality of questionable proprietorship of leashed but straining intimacy that seems inseparable from this sort of affair
It is so much more palpable than matrimony
If anything was wanted to complete my conviction it was my uncless eyes when presently he became aware of mine a certain embarrassment and a certain pride and defiance
And the next day he made an opportunity to praise the ladys intelligence to me concisely lest I should miss the point of it all
After that I heard some gossipfrom a friend of the ladys
I was much too curious to do anything but listen
I had never in all my life imagined my uncle in an amorous attitude
It would appear that she called him her God in the Carafter the hero in a novel of Anthony Hopes
It was essential to the convention of their relations that he should go relentlessly whenever business called and it was generally arranged that it did call
To him women were an incident it was understood between them Ambition was the masterpassion
A great world called him and the noble hunger for Power
I have never been able to discover just how honest Mrs Scrymgeour was in all this but it is quite possible the immense glamour of his financial largeness prevailed with her and that she did bring a really romantic feeling to their encounters
There must have been some extraordinary moments
I was a good deal exercised and distressed about my aunt when I realised what was afoot
I thought it would prove a terrible humiliation to her
I suspected her of keeping up a brave front with the loss of my uncles affections fretting at her heart but there I simply underestimated her
She didnt hear for some time and when she did hear she was extremely angry and energetic
The sentimental situation didnt trouble her for a moment
She decided that my uncle wanted smacking
She accentuated herself with an unexpected new hat went and gave him an inconceivable talkingto at the Hardingham and then came round to blowup me for not telling her what was going on before
I tried to bring her to a proper sense of the accepted values in this affair but my aunts originality of outlook was never so invincible
Men dont tell on one another in affairs of passion I protested and suchlike worldly excuses
Women
she said in high indignation and men
It isnt women and menits him and me George
Why dont you talk sense
Old passions all very well George in its way and Im the last person to be jealous
But this is old nonsense
Im not going to let him show off what a silly old lobster he is to other women
Ill mark every scrap of his underclothes with red letters PonderevoPrivateevery scrap
Going about making love indeedin abdominal beltsat his time of life
I cannot imagine what passed between her and my uncle
But I have no doubt that for once her customary badinage was laid aside
How they talked then I do not know for I who knew them so well had never heard that much of intimacy between them
At any rate it was a concerned and preoccupied God in the Car I had to deal with in the next few days unusually Zzzzy and given to slight impatient gestures that had nothing to do with the current conversation
And it was evident that in all directions he was finding things unusually difficult to explain
All the intimate moments in this affair were hidden from me but in the end my aunt triumphed
He did not so much throw as jerk over Mrs Scrymgeour and she did not so much make a novel of it as upset a huge pailful of attenuated and adulterated female soul upon this occasion
My aunt did not appear in that even remotely
So that it is doubtful if the lady knew the real causes of her abandonment
The Napoleonic hero was practically unmarried and he threw over his lady as Napoleon threw over Josephine for a great alliance
It was a triumph for my aunt but it had its price
For some time it was evident things were strained between them
He gave up the lady but he resented having to do so deeply
She had meant more to his imagination than one could have supposed
He wouldnt for a long time come round
He became touchy and impatient and secretive towards my aunt and she I noted after an amazing check or so stopped that stream of kindly abuse that had flowed for so long and had been so great a refreshment in their lives
They were both the poorer for its cessation both less happy
She devoted herself more and more to Lady Grove and the humours and complications of its management
The servants took to heras they sayshe godmothered three Susans during her rule the coachmans the gardeners and the Up Hill gamekeepers
She got together a library of old household books that were in the vein of the place
She revived the stillroom and became a great artist in jellies and elder and cowslip wine
X And while I neglected the development of my uncles financesand my own in my scientific work and my absorbing conflict with the difficulties of flyinghis schemes grew more and more expansive and hazardous and his spending wilder and laxer
I believe that a haunting sense of the intensifying unsoundness of his position accounts largely for his increasing irritability and his increasing secretiveness with my aunt and myself during these crowning years
He dreaded I think having to explain he feared our jests might pierce unwittingly to the truth
Even in the privacy of his mind he would not face the truth
He was accumulating unrealisable securities in his safes until they hung a potential avalanche over the economic world
But his buying became a fever and his restless desire to keep it up with himself that he was making a triumphant progress to limitless wealth gnawed deeper and deeper
A curious feature of this time with him was his buying over and over again of similar things
His ideas seemed to run in series
Within a twelvemonth he bought five new motorcars each more swift and powerful than its predecessor and only the repeated prompt resignation of his chief chauffeur at each moment of danger prevented his driving them himself
He used them more and more
He developed a passion for locomotion for its own sake
Then he began to chafe at Lady Grove fretted by a chance jest he had overheard at a dinner
This house George he said
Its a misfit
Theres no elbowroom in it its choked with old memories
And I cant stand all these damned Durgans
That chap in the corner George
No
the other corner
The man in a cherrycoloured coat
He watched you
Hed look silly if I stuck a poker through his Gizzard
Hed look I reflected much as he does now
As though he was amused
He replaced his glasses which had fallen at his emotion and glared at his antagonists
What are they
What are they all the lot of em
Dead as Mutton
They just stuck in the mud
They didnt even rise to the Reformation
The old outofdate Reformation
Move with the timesthey moved against the times
Just a Family of Failurethey never even tried
Theyre jes George exactly what Im not
Exactly
It isnt suitable All this living in the Past
And I want a bigger place too George
I want air and sunlight and room to move about and more service
A house where you can get a Move on things
Zzzz
Why
its like a discordit jarseven to have the telephone
Theres nothing nothing except the terrace thats worth a Rap
Its all dark and old and dried up and full of oldfashioned thingsmusty old ideesfitter for a silverfish than a modern man
I dont know how I got here
He broke out into a new grievance
That damned vicar he complained thinks I ought to think myself lucky to get this place
Every time I meet him I can see him think it One of these days George Ill show him what a Modun house is like
And he did
I remember the day when he declared as Americans say for Crest Hill
He had come up to see my new gas plant for I was then only just beginning to experiment with auxiliary collapsible balloons and all the time the shine of his glasses was wandering away to the open down beyond
Lets go back to Lady Grove over the hill he said
Something I want to show you
Something fine
It was an empty sunlit place that summer evening sky and earth warm with sundown and a pewit or so just accentuating the pleasant stillness that ends a long clear day
A beautiful peace it was to wreck for ever
And there was my uncle the modern man of power in his grey tophat and his grey suit and his blackribboned glasses short thinlegged largestomached pointing and gesticulating threatening this calm
He began with a wave of his arm
Thats the place George he said
See
Eh
I criedfor I had been thinking of remote things
I got it
Got what
For a housea Twentieth Century house
Thats the place for it
One of his characteristic phrases was begotten in him
Foursquare to the winds of heaven George
he said
Eh
Foursquare to the winds of heaven
Youll get the winds up here I said
A mammoth house it ought to be Georgeto suit these hills
Quite I said
Great galleries and thingsrunning out there and thereSee
I been thinking of it George
Looking out all this wayacross the Weald
With its back to Lady Grove
And the morning sun in its eye
Like an eagle Georgelike an eagle
So he broached to me what speedily became the leading occupation of his culminating years Crest Hill
But all the world has heard of that extravagant place which grew and changed its plans as it grew and bubbled like a salted snail and burgeoned and bulged and evermore grew
I know not what delirium of pinnacles and terraces and arcades and corridors glittered at last upon the uplands of his mind the place for all that its expansion was terminated abruptly by our collapse is wonderful enough as it standsthat empty instinctive building of a childless man
His chief architect was a young man named Westminster whose work he had picked out in the architecture room of the Royal Academy on account of a certain grandiose courage in it but with him he associated from time to time a number of fellow professionals stonemasons sanitary engineers painters sculptors scribes metal workers wood carvers furniture designers ceramic specialists landscape gardeners and the man who designs the arrangement and ventilation of the various new houses in the London Zoological Gardens
In addition he had his own ideas
The thing occupied his mind at all times but it held it completely from Friday night to Monday morning
He would come down to Lady Grove on Friday night in a crowded motorcar that almost dripped architects
He didnt however confine himself to architects every one was liable to an invitation to weekend and view Crest Hill and many an eager promoter unaware of how Napoleonically and completely my uncle had departmentalised his mind tried to creep up to him by way of tiles and ventilators and new electric fittings
Always on Sunday mornings unless the weather was vile he would so soon as breakfast and his secretaries were disposed of visit the site with a considerable retinue and alter and develop plans making modifications Zzzzing giving immense new orders verballyan unsatisfactory way as Westminster and the contractors ultimately found
There he stands in my memory the symbol of this age for me the man of luck and advertisement the current master of the world
There he stands upon the great outward sweep of the terrace before the huge main entrance a little figure ridiculously disproportionate to that fortyfoot arch with the granite ball behind himthe astronomical ball brass coopered that represented the world with a little adjustable tube of lenses on a gunmetal arm that focussed the sun upon just that point of the earth on which it chanced to be shining vertically
There he stands Napoleonically grouped with his retinue men in tweeds and golfingsuits a little solicitor whose name I forget in grey trousers and a black jacket and Westminster in Jaeger underclothing a floriferous tie and peculiar brown cloth of his own
The downland breeze flutters my uncles coattails disarranges his stiff hair and insists on the evidence of undisciplined appetites in face and form as he points out this or that feature in the prospect to his attentive collaborator
Below are hundreds of feet of wheelingplanks ditches excavations heaps of earth piles of garden stone from the Wealden ridges
On either hand the walls of his irrelevant unmeaning palace rise at one time he had working in that placedisturbing the economic balance of the whole countryside by their presenceupwards of three thousand men
So he poses for my picture amidst the raw beginnings that were never to be completed
He did the strangest things about that place things more and more detached from any conception of financial scale things more and more apart from sober humanity
He seemed to think himself at last released from any such limitations
He moved a quite considerable hill and nearly sixty mature trees were moved with it to open his prospect eastward moved it about two hundred feet to the south
At another time he caught a suggestion from some city restaurant and made a billiardroom roofed with plate glass beneath the waters of his ornamental lake
He furnished one wing while its roof still awaited completion
He had a swimming bath thirty feet square next to his bedroom upstairs and to crown it all he commenced a great wall to hold all his dominions together free from the invasion of common men
It was a tenfoot wall glass surmounted and had it been completed as he intended it it would have had a total length of nearly eleven miles
Some of it towards the last was so dishonestly built that it collapsed within a year upon its foundations but some miles of it still stand
I never think of it now but what I think of the hundreds of eager little investors who followed his star whose hopes and lives whose wives security and childrens prospects are all mixed up beyond redemption with that flaking mortar
It is curious how many of these modern financiers of chance and bluff have ended their careers by building
It was not merely my uncle
Sooner or later they all seem to bring their luck to the test of realisation try to make their fluid opulence coagulate out as bricks and mortar bring moonshine into relations with a weekly wagessheet
Then the whole fabric of confidence and imagination tottersand down they come
When I think of that despoiled hillside that colossal litter of bricks and mortar and crude roads and paths the scaffolding and sheds the general quality of unforeseeing outrage upon the peace of nature I am reminded of a chat I had with the vicar one bleak day after he had witnessed a glide
He talked to me of aeronautics as I stood in jersey and shorts beside my machine fresh from alighting and his cadaverous face failed to conceal a peculiar desolation that possessed him
Almost you convince me he said coming up to me against my will A marvellous invention
But it will take you a long time sir before you can emulate that perfect mechanismthe wing of a bird
He looked at my sheds
Youve changed the look of this valley too he said
Temporary defilements I remarked guessing what was in his mind
Of course
Things come and go
Things come and go
ButHm
Ive just been up over the hill to look at Mr Edward Ponderevos new house
Thatthat is something more permanent
A magnificent placein many ways
Imposing
Ive never somehow brought myself to go that way before
Things are greatly advanced We findthe great number of strangers introduced into the villages about here by these operations workingmen chiefly a little embarrassing
It put us out
They bring a new spirit into the place bettingideasall sorts of queer notions
Our publicans like it of course
And they come and sleep in ones outhousesand make the place a little unsafe at nights
The other morning I couldnt sleepa slight dyspepsiaand I looked out of the window
I was amazed to see people going by on bicycles
A silent procession
I counted ninetysevenin the dawn
All going up to the new road for Crest Hill
Remarkable I thought it
And so Ive been up to see what they were doing
They would have been more than remarkable thirty years ago I said
Yes indeed
Things change
We think nothing of it now at allcomparatively
And that big house He raised his eyebrows
Really stupendous
Stupendous
All the hillsidethe old turfcut to ribbons
His eye searched my face
Weve grown so accustomed to look up to Lady Grove he said and smiled in search of sympathy
It shifts our centre of gravity
Things will readjust themselves I lied
He snatched at the phrase
Of course he said
Theyll readjust themselvessettle down again
Must
In the old way
Its bound to come right againa comforting thought
Yes
After all Lady Grove itself had to be built once upon a timewasto begin withartificial
His eye returned to my aeroplane
He sought to dismiss his graver preoccupations
I should think twice he remarked before I trusted myself to that concern
But I suppose one grows accustomed to the motion
He bade me good morning and went his way bowed and thoughtful
He had kept the truth from his mind a long time but that morning it had forced its way to him with an aspect that brooked no denial that this time it was not just changes that were coming in his world but that all his world lay open and defenceless conquered and surrendered doomed so far as he could see root and branch scale and form alike to change
CHAPTER THE THIRD SOARING I For nearly all the time that my uncle was incubating and hatching Crest Hill I was busy in a little transverse valley between that great beginning and Lady Grove with more and more costly and ambitious experiments in aerial navigation
This work was indeed the main substance of my life through all the great time of the TonoBungay symphony
I have told already how I came to devote myself to this system of inquiries how in a sort of disgust with the common adventure of life I took up the dropped ends of my college studies taking them up again with a mans resolution instead of a boys ambition
From the first I did well at this work
Itwas I think largely a case of special aptitude of a peculiar irrelevant vein of faculty running through my mind
It is one of those things men seem to have by chance that has little or nothing to do with their general merit and which it is ridiculous to be either conceited or modest about
I did get through a very big mass of work in those years working for a time with a concentrated fierceness that left little of such energy or capacity as I possess unused
I worked out a series of problems connected with the stability of bodies pitching in the air and the internal movements of the wind and I also revolutionised one leading part at last of the theory of explosive engines
These things are to be found in the Philosophical Transactions the Mathematical Journal and less frequently in one or two other such publications and they neednt detain us here
Indeed I doubt if I could write about them here
One acquires a sort of shorthand for ones notes and mind in relation to such special work
I have never taught nor lectured that is to say I have never had to express my thoughts about mechanical things in ordinary everyday language and I doubt very much if I could do so now without extreme tedium
My work was to begin with very largely theoretical
I was able to attack such early necessities of verification as arose with quite little models using a turntable to get the motion through the air and cane whalebone and silk as building material
But a time came when incalculable factors crept in factors of human capacity and factors of insufficient experimental knowledge when one must needs guess and try
Then I had to enlarge the scale of my operations and soon I had enlarged them very greatly
I set to work almost concurrently on the balance and stability of gliders and upon the steering of inflated bags the latter a particularly expensive branch of work
I was no doubt moved by something of the same spirit of lavish expenditure that was running away with my uncle in these developments
Presently my establishment above Lady Grove had grown to a painted wood chalet big enough to accommodate six men and in which I would sometimes live for three weeks together to a gasometer to a motorhouse to three big corrugatedroofed sheds and lockup houses to a stage from which to start gliders to a workshop and so forth
A rough road was made
We brought up gas from Cheaping and electricity from Woking which place I found also afforded a friendly workshop for larger operations than I could manage
I had the luck also to find a man who seemed my heavensent secondincommandCothope his name was
He was a selfeducatedman he had formerly been a sapper and he was one of the best and handiest working engineers alive
Without him I do not think I could have achieved half what I have done
At times he has been not so much my assistant as my collaborator and has followed my fortunes to this day
Other men came and went as I needed them
I do not know how far it is possible to convey to any one who has not experienced it the peculiar interest the peculiar satisfaction that lies in a sustained research when one is not hampered by want of money
It is a different thing from any other sort of human effort
You are free from the exasperating conflict with your fellowcreatures altogetherat least so far as the essential work goes that for me is its peculiar merit
Scientific truth is the remotest of mistresses she hides in strange places she is attained by tortuous and laborious roads but SHE IS ALWAYS THERE
Win to her and she will not fail you she is yours and mankinds for ever
She is reality the one reality I have found in this strange disorder of existence
She will not sulk with you nor misunderstand you nor cheat you of your reward upon some petty doubt
You cannot change her by advertisement or clamour nor stifle her in vulgarities
Things grow under your hands when you serve her things that are permanent as nothing else is permanent in the whole life of man
That I think is the peculiar satisfaction of science and its enduring reward
The taking up of experimental work produced a great change in my personal habits
I have told how already once in my life at Wimblehurst I had a period of discipline and continuous effort and how when I came to South Kensington I became demoralised by the immense effect of London by its innumerable imperative demands upon my attention and curiosity
And I parted with much of my personal pride when I gave up science for the development of TonoBungay
But my poverty kept me abstinent and my youthful romanticism kept me chaste until my married life was well under way
Then in all directions I relaxed
I did a large amount of work but I never troubled to think whether it was my maximum nor whether the moods and indolences that came to me at times were avoidable things
With the coming of plenty I ate abundantly and foolishly drank freely and followed my impulses more and more carelessly
I felt no reason why I should do anything else
Never at any point did I use myself to the edge of my capacity
The emotional crisis of my divorce did not produce any immediate change in these matters of personal discipline
I found some difficulty at first in concentrating my mind upon scientific work it was so much more exacting than business but I got over that difficulty by smoking
I became an inordinate cigar smoker it gave me moods of profound depression but I treated these usually by the homeopathic methodby lighting another cigar
I didnt realise at all how loose my moral and nervous fibre had become until I reached the practical side of my investigations and was face to face with the necessity of finding out just how it felt to use a glider and just what a man could do with one
I got into this relaxed habit of living in spite of very real tendencies in my nature towards discipline
Ive never been in love with selfindulgence
That philosophy of the loose lip and the lax paunch is one for which Ive always had an instinctive distrust
I like bare things stripped things plain austere and continent things fine lines and cold colours
But in these plethoric times when there is too much coarse stuff for everybody and the struggle for life takes the form of competitive advertisement and the effort to fill your neighbours eye when there is no urgent demand either for personal courage sound nerves or stark beauty we find ourselves by accident
Always before these times the bulk of the people did not overeat themselves because they couldnt whether they wanted to do so or not and all but a very few were kept fit by unavoidable exercise and personal danger
Now if only he pitch his standard low enough and keep free from pride almost any one can achieve a sort of excess
You can go through contemporary life fudging and evading indulging and slacking never really hungry nor frightened nor passionately stirred your highest moment a mere sentimental orgasm and your first real contact with primary and elemental necessities the sweat of your deathbed
So I think it was with my uncle so very nearly it was with me
But the glider brought me up smartly
I had to find out how these things went down the air and the only way to find out is to go down with one
And for a time I wouldnt face it
There is something impersonal about a book I suppose
At any rate I find myself able to write down here just the confession Ive never been able to make to any one face to face the frightful trouble it was to me to bring myself to do what I suppose every other coloured boy in the West Indies could do without turning a hair and that is to fling myself off for my first soar down the wind
The first trial was bound to be the worst it was an experiment I made with life and the chance of death or injury was I supposed about equal to the chance of success
I believed that with a dawnlike lucidity
I had begun with a glider that I imagined was on the lines of the Wright brothers aeroplane but I could not be sure
It might turn over
I might upset it
It might burrow its nose at the end and smash itself and me
The conditions of the flight necessitated alert attention it wasnt a thing to be done by jumping off and shutting ones eyes or getting angry or drunk to do it
One had to use ones weight to balance
And when at last I did it it was horriblefor ten seconds
For ten seconds or so as I swept down the air flattened on my infernal framework and with the wind in my eyes the rush of the ground beneath me filled me with sick and helpless terror I felt as though some violent oscillatory current was throbbing in brain and back bone and I groaned aloud
I set my teeth and groaned
It was a groan wrung out of me in spite of myself
My sensations of terror swooped to a climax
And then you know they ended
Suddenly my terror was over and done with
I was soaring through the air right way up steadily and no mischance had happened
I felt intensely alive and my nerves were strung like a bow
I shifted a limb swerved and shouted between fear and triumph as I recovered from the swerve and heeled the other way and steadied myself
I thought I was going to hit a rook that was flying athwart meit was queer with what projectile silence that jumped upon me out of nothingness and I yelled helplessly Get out of the way
The bird doubled itself up like a partly inverted V flapped went up to the right abruptly and vanished from my circle of interest
Then I saw the shadow of my aeroplane keeping a fixed distance before me and very steady and the turf as it seemed streaming out behind it
The turfit wasnt after all streaming so impossibly fast
When I came gliding down to the safe spread of level green I had chosen I was as cool and ready as a city clerk who drops off an omnibus in motion and I had learnt much more than soaring
I tilted up her nose at the right moment levelled again and grounded like a snowflake on a windless day
I lay flat for an instant and then knelt up and got on my feet atremble but very satisfied with myself
Cothope was running down the hill to me

But from that day I went into training and I kept myself in training for many months
I had delayed my experiments for very nearly six weeks on various excuses because of my dread of this first flight because of the slackness of body and spirit that had come to me with the business life
The shame of that cowardice spurred me none the less because it was probably altogether my own secret
I felt that Cothope at any rate might suspect
Wellhe shouldnt suspect again
It is curious that I remember that shame and self accusation and its consequences far more distinctly than I recall the weeks of vacillation before I soared
For a time I went altogether without alcohol I stopped smoking altogether and ate very sparingly and every day I did something that called a little upon my nerves and muscles
I soared as frequently as I could
I substituted a motorbicycle for the London train and took my chances in the southward traffic and I even tried what thrills were to be got upon a horse
But they put me on made horses and I conceived a perhaps unworthy contempt for the certitudes of equestrian exercise in comparison with the adventures of mechanism
Also I walked along the high wall at the back of Lady Grove garden and at last brought myself to stride the gap where the gate comes
If I didnt altogether get rid of a certain giddy instinct by such exercises at least I trained my will until it didnt matter
And soon I no longer dreaded flight but was eager to go higher into the air and I came to esteem soaring upon a glider that even over the deepest dip in the ground had barely forty feet of fall beneath it a mere mockery of what flight might be
I began to dream of the keener freshness in the air high above the beechwoods and it was rather to satisfy that desire than as any legitimate development of my proper work that presently I turned a part of my energies and the bulk of my private income to the problem of the navigable balloon
II I had gone far beyond that initial stage I had had two smashes and a broken rib which my aunt nursed with great energy and was getting some reputation in the aeronautic world when suddenly as though she had never really left it the Honourable Beatrice Normandy darkeyed and with the old disorderly wave of the hair from her brow came back into my life
She came riding down a grass path in the thickets below Lady Grove perched up on a huge black horse and the old Earl of Carnaby and Archie Garvell her halfbrother were with her
My uncle had been bothering me about the Crest Hill hotwater pipes and we were returning by a path transverse to theirs and came out upon them suddenly
Old Carnaby was trespassing on our ground and so he hailed us in a friendly fashion and pulled up to talk to us
I didnt note Beatrice at all at first
I was interested in Lord Carnaby that remarkable vestige of his own brilliant youth
I had heard of him but never seen him
For a man of sixtyfive who had sinned all the sins so they said and laid waste the most magnificent political debut of any man of his generation he seemed to me to be looking remarkably fit and fresh
He was a lean little man with greyblue eyes in his brown face and his cracked voice was the worst thing in his effect
Hope you dont mind us coming this way Ponderevo he cried and my uncle who was sometimes a little too general and generous with titles answered Not at all my lord not at all
Glad you make use of it
Youre building a great place over the hill said Carnaby
Thought Id make a show for once said my uncle
It looks big because its spread out for the sun
Air and sunlight said the earl
You cant have too much of them
But before our time they used to build for shelter and water and the high road
Then I discovered that the silent figure behind the earl was Beatrice
Id forgotten her sufficiently to think for a moment that she hadnt changed at all since she had watched me from behind the skirts of Lady Drew
She was looking at me and her dainty brow under her broad brimmed hatshe was wearing a grey hat and loose unbuttoned coatwas knit with perplexity trying I suppose to remember where she had seen me before
Her shaded eyes met mine with that mute question
It seemed incredible to me she didnt remember
Well said the earl and touched his horse
Garvell was patting the neck of his horse which was inclined to fidget and disregarding me
He nodded over his shoulder and followed
His movement seemed to release a train of memories in her
She glanced suddenly at him and then back at me with a flash of recognition that warmed instantly to a faint smile
She hesitated as if to speak to me smiled broadly and understandingly and turned to follow the others
All three broke into a canter and she did not look back
I stood for a second or so at the crossing of the lanes watching her recede and then became aware that my uncle was already some paces off and talking over his shoulder in the belief that I was close behind
I turned about and strode to overtake him
My mind was full of Beatrice and this surprise
I remembered her simply as a Normandy
Id clean forgotten that Garvell was the son and she the stepdaughter of our neighbour Lady Osprey
Indeed Id probably forgotten at that time that we had Lady Osprey as a neighbour
There was no reason at all for remembering it
It was amazing to find her in this Surrey countryside when Id never thought of her as living anywhere in the world but at Bladesover Park near forty miles and twenty years away
She was so aliveso unchanged
The same quick warm blood was in her cheeks
It seemed only yesterday that we had kissed among the bracken stems
Eh
I said
I say hes good stuff said my uncle
You can say what you like against the aristocracy George Lord Carnabys rattling good stuff
Theres a sort of Savoir Faire somethingits an oldfashioned phrase George but a good one theres a BongTong
Its like the Oxford turf George you cant grow it in a year
I wonder how they do it
Its living always on a Scale George
Its being there from the beginning
She might I said to myself be a picture by Romney come alive
They tell all these stories about him said my uncle but what do they all amount to
Gods
I said to myself but why have I forgotten for so long
Those queer little brows of hers the touch of mischief in her eyesthe way she breaks into a smile
I dont blame him said my uncle
Mostly its imagination
That and leisure George
When I was a young man I was kept pretty busy
So were you
Even then
What puzzled me more particularly was the queer trick of my memory that had never recalled anything vital of Beatrice whatever when I met Garvell again that had indeed recalled nothing except a boyish antagonism and our fight
Now when my senses were full of her it seemed incredible that I could ever have forgotten III Oh Crikey
said my aunt reading a letter behind her coffeemachine
HERES a young woman George
We were breakfasting together in the big window bay at Lady Grove that looks upon the iris beds my uncle was in London
I sounded an interrogative note and decapitated an egg
Whos Beatrice Normandy
asked my aunt
Ive not heard of her before
She the young woman
Yes
Says she knows you
Im no hand at old etiquette George but her line is a bit unusual
Practically she says shes going to make her mother Eh
Stepmother isnt it
You seem to know a lot about her
She says motherLady Osprey
Theyre to call on me anyhow next Wednesday week at four and theres got to be you for tea
Eh
Youfor tea
Hm
She had ratherforce of character
When I knew her before
I became aware of my aunts head sticking out obliquely from behind the coffeemachine and regarding me with wide blue curiosity
I met her gaze for a moment flinched coloured and laughed
Ive known her longer than Ive known you I said and explained at length
My aunt kept her eye on me over and round the coffeemachine as I did so
She was greatly interested and asked several elucidatory questions
Why didnt you tell me the day you saw her
Youve had her on your mind for a week she said
It IS odd I didnt tell you I admitted
You thought Id get a Down on her said my aunt conclusively
Thats what you thought and opened the rest of her letters
The two ladies came in a ponycarriage with conspicuous punctuality and I had the unusual experience of seeing my aunt entertaining callers
We had tea upon the terrace under the cedar but old Lady Osprey being an embittered Protestant had never before seen the inside of the house and we made a sort of tour of inspection that reminded me of my first visit to the place
In spite of my preoccupation with Beatrice I stored a queer little memory of the contrast between the two other women my aunt tall slender and awkward in a simple blue homekeeping dress an omnivorous reader and a very authentic wit and the lady of pedigree short and plump dressed with Victorian fussiness living at the intellectual level of palmistry and genteel fiction pink in the face and generally flustered by a sense of my aunts social strangeness and disposed under the circumstances to behave rather like an imitation of the more queenly moments of her own cook
The one seemed made of whalebone the other of dough
My aunt was nervous partly through the intrinsic difficulty of handling the lady and partly because of her passionate desire to watch Beatrice and me and her nervousness took a common form with her a wider clumsiness of gesture and an exacerbation of her habitual oddity of phrase which did much to deepen the pink perplexity of the lady of title
For instance I heard my aunt admit that one of the Stuart Durgan ladies did look a bit balmy on the crumpet she described the knights of the age of chivalry as korvorting about on the offchance of a dragon she explained she was always old mucking about the garden and instead of offering me a Garibaldi biscuit she asked me with that faint lisp of hers to have some squashed flies George
I felt convinced Lady Osprey would describe her as a most eccentric person on the very first opportunity a most eccentric person
One could see her as people say shaping for that
Beatrice was dressed very quietly in brown with a simple but courageous broadbrimmed hat and an unexpected quality of being grownup and responsible
She guided her stepmother through the first encounter scrutinised my aunt and got us all well in movement through the house and then she turned her attention to me with a quick and halfconfident smile
We havent met she said since It was in the Warren
Of course she said the Warren
I remembered it all except just the name
I was eight
Her smiling eyes insisted on my memories being thorough
I looked up and met them squarely a little at a loss for what I should say
I gave you away pretty completely she said meditating upon my face
And afterwards I gave way Archie
She turned her face away from the others and her voice fell ever so little
They gave him a licking for telling lies
she said as though that was a pleasant memory
And when it was all over I went to our wigwam
You remember the wigwam
Out in the West Wood
Yesand criedfor all the evil I had done you I suppose
Ive often thought of it since
Lady Osprey stopped for us to overtake her
My dear
she said to Beatrice
Such a beautiful gallery
Then she stared very hard at me puzzled in the most naked fashion to understand who I might be
People say the oak staircase is rather good said my aunt and led the way
Lady Osprey with her skirts gathered for the ascent to the gallery and her hand on the newel turned and addressed a look full of meaning overflowing indeed with meaningsat her charge
The chief meaning no doubt was caution about myself but much of it was just meaning at large
I chanced to catch the response in a mirror and detected Beatrice with her nose wrinkled into a swift and entirely diabolical grimace
Lady Osprey became a deeper shade of pink and speechless with indignationit was evident she disavowed all further responsibility as she followed my aunt upstairs
Its dark but theres a sort of dignity said Beatrice very distinctly regarding the hall with serene tranquillity and allowing the unwilling feet on the stairs to widen their distance from us
She stood a step up so that she looked down a little upon me and over me at the old hall
She turned upon me abruptly when she thought her stepmother was beyond earshot
But how did you get here
she asked
Here
All this
She indicated space and leisure by a wave of the hand at hall and tall windows and sunlit terrace
Werent you the housekeepers son
Ive adventured
My uncle has becomea great financier
He used to be a little chemist about twenty miles from Bladesover
Were promoters now amalgamators big people on the new model
I understand
She regarded me with interested eyes visibly thinking me out
And you recognised me
I asked
After a second or so
I saw you recognised me
I couldnt place you but I knew I knew you
Then Archie being there helped me to remember
Im glad to meet again I ventured
Id never forgotten you
One doesnt forget those childish things
We regarded one another for a moment with a curiously easy and confident satisfaction in coming together again
I cant explain our ready zest in one another
The thing was so
We pleased each other we had no doubt in our minds that we pleased each other
From the first we were at our ease with one another
So picturesque so very picturesque came a voice from above and then Beeatrice
Ive a hundred things I want to know about you she said with an easy intimacy as we went up the winding steps As the four of us sat at tea together under the cedar on the terrace she asked questions about my aeronautics
My aunt helped with a word or so about my broken ribs
Lady Osprey evidently regarded flying as a most indesirable and improper topica blasphemous intrusion upon the angels
It isnt flying I explained
We dont fly yet
You never will she said compactly
You never will
Well I said we do what we can
The little lady lifted a small gloved hand and indicated a height of about four feet from the ground
Thus far she said thus farAND NO FARTHER
No
She became emphatically pink
NO she said again quite conclusively and coughed shortly
Thank you she said to her ninth or tenth cake
Beatrice burst into cheerful laughter with her eye on me
I was lying on the turf and this perhaps caused a slight confusion about the primordial curse in Lady Ospreys mind
Upon his belly shall he go she said with quiet distinctness all the days of his life
After which we talked no more of aeronautics
Beatrice sat bunched together in a chair and regarded me with exactly the same scrutiny I thought the same adventurous aggression that I had faced long ago at the teatable in my mothers room
She was amazingly like that little Princess of my Bladesover memories the wilful misbehaviours of her hair seemed the sameher voice things one would have expected to be changed altogether
She formed her plans in the same quick way and acted with the same irresponsible decision
She stood up abruptly
What is there beyond the terrace
she said and found me promptly beside her
I invented a view for her
At the further corner from the cedar she perched herself up upon the parapet and achieved an air of comfort among the lichenous stones
Now tell me she said all about yourself
Tell me about yourself I know such duffers of men
They all do the same things
How did you gethere
All my men WERE here
They couldnt have got here if they hadnt been here always
They wouldnt have thought it right
Youve climbed
If its climbing I said
She went off at a tangent
ItsI dont know if youll understandinteresting to meet you again
Ive remembered you
I dont know why but I have
Ive used you as a sort of lay figurewhen Ive told myself stories
But youve always been rather stiff and difficult in my storiesin readymade clothesa Labour Member or a Bradlaugh or something like that
Youre not like that a bit
And yet you ARE
She looked at me
Was it much of a fight
They make out it is
I dont know why
I was shot up here by an accident I said
There was no fight at all
Except to keep honest perhaps and I made no great figure in that
I and my uncle mixed a medicine and it blew us up
No merit in that
But youve been here all the time
Tell me what you have done first
One thing we didnt do
She meditated for a moment
What
said I
Produce a little halfbrother for Bladesover
So it went to the Phillbrick gang
And they let it
And I and my stepmotherwe let too
And live in a little house
She nodded her head vaguely over her shoulder and turned to me again
Well suppose it was an accident
Here you are
Now youre here what are you going to do
Youre young
Is it to be Parliament
heard some men the other day talking about you
Before I knew you were you
They said that was what you ought to do
She put me through my intentions with a close and vital curiosity
It was just as she had tried to imagine me a soldier and place me years ago
She made me feel more planless and incidental than ever
You want to make a flyingmachine she pursued and when you fly
What then
Would it be for fighting
I told her something of my experimental work
She had never heard of the soaring aeroplane and was excited by the thought and keen to hear about it
She had thought all the work so far had been a mere projecting of impossible machines
For her Pilcher and Lilienthal had died in vain
She did not know such men had lived in the world
But thats dangerous
she said with a note of discovery
Ohits dangerous
Beeatrice
Lady Osprey called
Beatrice dropped from the wall to her feet
Where do you do this soaring
Beyond the high Barrows
East of Crest Hill and the wood
Do you mind people coming to see
Whenever you please
Only let me know Ill take my chance some day
Some day soon
She looked at me thoughtfully smiled and our talk was at an end
IV All my later work in aeronautics is associated in my memory with the quality of Beatrice with her incidenta presence with things she said and did and things I thought of that had reference to her
In the spring of that year I had got to a flying machine that lacked nothing but longitudinal stability
My model flew like a bird for fifty or a hundred yards or so and then either dived and broke its nose or what was commoner reared up slid back and smashed its propeller
The rhythm of the pitching puzzled me
I felt it must obey some laws not yet quite clearly stated
I became therefore a student of theory and literature for a time I hit upon the string of considerations that led me to what is called Ponderevos Principle and my FRS and I worked this out in three long papers
Meanwhile I made a lot of turntable and glider models and started in upon an idea of combining gasbags and gliders
Balloon work was new to me
I had made one or two ascents in the balloons of the Aero Club before I started my gasometer and the balloon shed and gave Cothope a couple of months with Sir Peter Rumchase
My uncle found part of the money for these developments he was growing interested and competitive in this business because of Lord Booms prize and the amount of reclame involved and it was at his request that I named my first navigable balloon Lord Roberts Alpha
Lord Roberts A very nearly terminated all my investigations
My idea both in this and its more successful and famous younger brother Lord Roberts B was to utilise the idea of a contractile balloon with a rigid flat base a balloon shaped rather like an inverted boat that should almost support the apparatus but not quite
The gasbag was of the chambered sort used for these long forms and not with an internal balloonette
The trouble was to make the thing contractile
This I sought to do by fixing a long finemeshed silk net over it that was fastened to be rolled up on two longitudinal rods
Practically I contracted my sausage gasbag by netting it down
The ends were too complex for me to describe here but I thought them out elaborately and they were very carefully planned
Lord Roberts A was furnished with a single big screw forward and there was a rudder aft
The engine was the first one to be so to speak right in the plane of the gasbag
I lay immediately under the balloon on a sort of glider framework far away from either engine or rudder controlling them by wirepulls constructed on the principle of the wellknown Bowden brake of the cyclist
But Lord Roberts A has been pretty exhaustively figured and described in various aeronautical publications
The unforeseen defect was the badness of the work in the silk netting
It tore aft as soon as I began to contract the balloon and the last two segments immediately bulged through the hole exactly as an inner tube will bulge through the ruptured outer cover of a pneumatic tire and then the sharp edge of the torn net cut the oiledsilk of the distended last segment along a weak seam and burst it with a loud report
Up to that point the whole thing had been going on extremely well
As a navigable balloon and before I contracted it the Lord Roberts A was an unqualified success
It had run out of the shed admirably at nine or ten miles an hour or more and although there was a gentle southwester blowing it had gone up and turned and faced it as well as any craft of the sort I have ever seen
I lay in my customary glider position horizontal and face downward and the invisibility of all the machinery gave an extraordinary effect of independent levitation
Only by looking up as it were and turning my head back could I see the flat aeroplane bottom of the balloon and the rapid successive passages swish swish swish of the vans of the propeller
I made a wide circle over Lady Grove and Duffield and out towards Effingham and came back quite successfully to the startingpoint
Down below in the October sunlight were my sheds and the little group that had been summoned to witness the start their faces craned upward and most of them scrutinising my expression through fieldglasses
I could see Carnaby and Beatrice on horseback and two girls I did not know with them Cothope and three or four workmen I employed my aunt and Mrs Levinstein who was staying with her on foot and Dimmock the veterinary surgeon and one or two others
My shadow moved a little to the north of them like the shadow of a fish
At Lady Grove the servants were out on the lawn and the Duffield school playground swarmed with children too indifferent to aeronautics to cease their playing
But in the Crest Hill directionthe place looked extraordinarily squat and ugly from abovethere were knots and strings of staring workmen everywherenot one of them working but all agape
But now I write it it occurs to me that perhaps it was their dinner hour it was certainly near twelve
I hung for a moment or so enjoying the soar then turned about to face a clear stretch of open down let the engine out to full speed and set my rollers at work rolling in the net and so tightening the gasbags
Instantly the pace quickened with the diminished resistance
In that moment before the bang I think I must have been really flying
Before the net ripped just in the instant when my balloon was at its systole the whole apparatus was I am convinced heavier than air
That however is a claim that has been disputed and in any case this sort of priority is a very trivial thing
Then came a sudden retardation instantly followed by an inexpressibly disconcerting tilt downward of the machine
That I still recall with horror
I couldnt see what was happening at all and I couldnt imagine
It was a mysterious inexplicable dive
The thing it seemed without rhyme or reason was kicking up its heels in the air
The bang followed immediately and I perceived I was falling rapidly
I was too much taken by surprise to think of the proper cause of the report
I dont even know what I made of it
I was obsessed I suppose by that perpetual dread of the modern aeronaut a flash between engine and balloon
Yet obviously I wasnt wrapped in flames
I ought to have realised instantly it wasnt that
I did at any rate whatever other impressions there were release the winding of the outer net and let the balloon expand again and that no doubt did something to break my fall
I dont remember doing that
Indeed all I do remember is the giddy effect upon the landscape of falling swiftly upon it down a flat spiral the hurried rush of fields and trees and cottages on my left shoulder and the overhung feeling as if the whole apparatus was pressing down the top of my head
I didnt stop or attempt to stop the screw
That was going on swish swish swish all the time
Cothope really knows more about the fall than I do
He describes the easterly start the tilt and the appearance and bursting of a sort of bladder aft
Then down I swooped very swiftly but not nearly so steeply as I imagined I was doing
Fifteen or twenty degrees said Cothope to be exact
From him it was that I learnt that I let the nets loose again and so arrested my fall
He thinks I was more in control of myself than I remember
But I do not see why I should have forgotten so excellent a resolution
His impression is that I was really steering and trying to drop into the Farthing Down beeches
You hit the trees he said and the whole affair stood on its nose among them and then very slowly crumpled up
I saw youd been jerked out as I thought and I didnt stay for more
I rushed for my bicycle
As a matter of fact it was purely accidental that I came down in the woods
I am reasonably certain that I had no more control then than a thing in a parcel
I remember I felt a sort of wincing Now it comes
as the trees rushed up to me
If I remember that I should remember steering
Then the propeller smashed everything stopped with a jerk and I was falling into a mass of yellowing leaves and Lord Roberts A so it seemed to me was going back into the sky
I felt twigs and things hit me in the face but I didnt feel injured at the time I clutched at things that broke tumbled through a froth of green and yellow into a shadowy world of great barkcovered arms and there snatching wildly got a grip on a fair round branch and hung
I became intensely alert and clearheaded
I held by that branch for a moment and then looked about me and caught at another and then found myself holding to a practicable fork
I swung forward to that and got a leg around it below its junction and so was able presently to clamber down climbing very coolly and deliberately
I dropped ten feet or so from the lowest branch and fell on my feet
Thats all right I said and stared up through the tree to see what I could of the deflated and crumpled remains that had once been Lord Roberts A festooned on the branches it had broken
Gods
I said what a tumble
I wiped something that trickled from my face and was shocked to see my hand covered with blood
I looked at myself and saw what seemed to me an astonishing quantity of blood running down my arm and shoulder
I perceived my mouth was full of blood
Its a queer moment when one realises one is hurt and perhaps badly hurt and has still to discover just how far one is hurt
I explored my face carefully and found unfamiliar contours on the left side
The broken end of a branch had driven right through my cheek damaging my cheek and teeth and gums and left a splinter of itself stuck like an explorers fartherestpoint flag in the upper maxillary
That and a sprained wrist were all my damage
But I bled as though I had been chopped to pieces and it seemed to me that my face had been driven in
I cant describe just the horrible disgust I felt at that
This blood must be stopped anyhow I said thickheadedly
I wonder where theres a spiders weban odd twist for my mind to take
But it was the only treatment that occurred to me
I must have conceived some idea of going home unaided because I was thirty yards from the tree before I dropped
Then a kind of black disc appeared in the middle of the world and rushed out to the edge of things and blotted them out
I dont remember falling down
I fainted from excitement disgust at my injury and loss of blood and lay there until Cothope found me
He was the first to find me scorching as he did over the downland turf and making a wide course to get the Carnaby plantations at their narrowest
Then presently while he was trying to apply the methodical teachings of the St Johns Ambulance classes to a rather abnormal case Beatrice came galloping through the trees fulltilt with Lord Carnaby hard behind her and she was hatless muddy from a fall and white as death
And cool as a cucumber too said Cothope turning it over in his mind as he told me
They never seem quite to have their heads and never seem quite to lose em said Cothope generalising about the sex
Also he witnessed she acted with remarkable decision
The question was whether I should be taken to the house her stepmother occupied at Bedley Corner the Carnaby dower house or down to Carnabys place at Easting
Beatrice had no doubt in the matter for she meant to nurse me
Carnaby didnt seem to want that to happen
She WOULD have it wasnt half so far said Cothope
She faced us out I hate to be faced out of my opinion so Ive taken a pedometer over it since
Its exactly fortythree yards further
Lord Carnaby looked at her pretty straight said Cothope finishing the picture and then he give in
V But my story has made a jump from June to October and during that time my relations with Beatrice and the countryside that was her setting had developed in many directions
She came and went moving in an orbit for which I had no data going to London and Paris into Wales and Northampton while her stepmother on some independent system of her own also vanished and recurred intermittently
At home they obeyed the rule of an inflexible old maid Charlotte and Beatrice exercised all the rights of proprietorship in Carnabys extensive stables
Her interest in me was from the first undisguised
She found her way to my worksheds and developed rapidly in spite of the sincere discouragement of Cothope into a keen amateur of aeronautics
She would come sometimes in the morning sometimes in the afternoon sometimes afoot with an Irish terrier sometimes riding
She would come for three or four days every day vanish for a fortnight or three weeks return
It was not long before I came to look for her
From the first I found her immensely interesting
To me she was a new feminine type altogetherI have made it plain I think how limited was my knowledge of women
But she made me not simply interested in her but in myself
She became for me something that greatly changes a mans world
How shall I put it
She became an audience
Since Ive emerged from the emotional developments of the affair I have thought it out in a hundred aspects and it does seem to me that this way in which men and women make audiences for one another is a curiously influential force in their lives
For some it seems an audience is a vital necessity they seek audiences as creatures seek food others again my uncle among them can play to an imaginary audience
I I think have lived and can live without one
In my adolescence I was my own audience and my own court of honour
And to have an audience in ones mind is to play a part to become selfconscious and dramatic
For many years I had been selfforgetful and scientific
I had lived for work and impersonal interests until I found scrutiny applause and expectation in Beatrices eyes
Then I began to live for the effect I imagined I made upon her to make that very soon the principal value in my life
I played to her
I did things for the look of them
I began to dream more and more of beautiful situations and fine poses and groupings with her and for her
I put these things down because they puzzle me
I think I was in love with Beatrice as being in love is usually understood but it was quite a different state altogether from my passionate hunger for Marion or my keen sensuous desire for and pleasure in Effie
These were selfish sincere things fundamental and instinctive as sincere as the leap of a tiger
But until matters drew to a crisis with Beatrice there was an immense imaginative insurgence of a quite different quality
I am setting down here very gravely and perhaps absurdly what are no doubt elementary commonplaces for innumerable people
This love that grew up between Beatrice and myself was I thinkI put it quite tentatively and rather curiouslyromantic love
That unfortunate and truncated affair of my uncle and the Scrymgeour lady was really of the same stuff if a little different in quality
I have to admit that
The factor of audience was of primary importance in either else
Its effect upon me was to make me in many respects adolescent again
It made me keener upon the point of honour and anxious and eager to do high and splendid things and in particular brave things
So far it ennobled and upheld me
But it did also push me towards vulgar and showy things
At bottom it was disingenuous it gave my life the quality of stage scenery with one side to the audience another side that wasnt meant to show and an economy of substance
It certainly robbed my work of high patience and quality
I cut down the toil of research in my eagerness and her eagerness for fine flourishes in the air flights that would tell
I shirked the longer road
And it robbed me too of any fine perception of absurdity
Yet that was not everything in our relationship
The elemental thing was there also
It came in very suddenly
It was one day in the summer though I do not now recall without reference to my experimental memoranda whether it was in July or August
I was working with a new and more birdlike aeroplane with wing curvatures studied from Lilienthal Pilcher and Phillips that I thought would give a different rhythm for the pitching oscillations than anything Id had before
I was soaring my long course from the framework on the old barrow by my sheds down to Tinkers Corner
It is a clear stretch of downland except for two or three thickets of box and thorn to the right of my course one transverse trough in which there is bush and a small rabbit warren comes in from the east
I had started and was very intent on the peculiar long swoop with which any new arrangement flew
Then without any sort of notice right ahead of me appeared Beatrice riding towards Tinkers Corner to waylay and talk to me
She looked round over her shoulder saw me coming touched her horse to a gallop and then the brute bolted right into the path of my machine
There was a queer moment of doubt whether we shouldnt all smash together
I had to make up my mind very quickly whether I would pitchup and drop backward at once and take my chance of falling undamageda poor chance it would have beenin order to avoid any risk to her or whether I would lift against the wind and soar right over her
This latter I did
She had already got her horse in hand when I came up to her
Her womans body lay along his neck and she glanced up as I with wings aspread and every nerve in a state of tension swept over her
Then I had landed and was going back to where her horse stood still and trembling
We exchanged no greetings
She slid from her saddle into my arms and for one instant I held her
Those great wings she said and that was all
She lay in my arms and I thought for a moment she had fainted
Very near a nasty accident said Cothope coming up and regarding our grouping with disfavour
He took her horse by the bridle
Very dangerous thing coming across us like that
Beatrice disengaged herself from me stood for a moment trembling and then sat down on the turf Ill just sit down for a moment she said
Oh
she said
She covered her face with her hands while Cothope looked at her with an expression between suspicion and impatience
For some moments nobody moved
Then Cothope remarked that perhaps hed better get her water
As for me I was filled with a new outrageous idea begotten I scarcely know how from this incident with its instant contacts and swift emotions and that was that I must make love to and possess Beatrice
I see no particular reason why that thought should have come to me in that moment but it did
I do not believe that before then I had thought of our relations in such terms at all
Suddenly as I remember it the factor of passion came
She crouched there and I stood over her and neither of us said a word
But it was just as though something had been shouted from the sky
Cothope had gone twenty paces perhaps when she uncovered her face
I shant want any water she said
Call him back
VI After that the spirit of our relations changed
The old ease had gone
She came to me less frequently and when she came she would have some one with her usually old Carnaby and he would do the bulk of the talking
All through September she was away
When we were alone together there was a curious constraint
We became clouds of inexpressible feeling towards one another we could think of nothing that was not too momentous for words
Then came the smash of Lord Roberts A and I found myself with a bandaged face in a bedroom in the Bedley Corner dowerhouse with Beatrice presiding over an inefficient nurse Lady Osprey very pink and shocked in the background and my aunt jealously intervening
My injuries were much more showy than serious and I could have been taken to Lady Grove next day but Beatrice would not permit that and kept me at Bedley Corner three clear days
In the afternoon of the second day she became extremely solicitous for the proper aeration of the nurse packed her off for an hour in a brisk rain and sat by me alone
I asked her to marry me
All the whole I must admit it was not a situation that lent itself to eloquence
I lay on my back and talked through bandages and with some little difficulty for my tongue and mouth had swollen
But I was feverish and in pain and the emotional suspense I had been in so long with regard to her became now an unendurable impatience
Comfortable
she asked
Yes
Shall I read to you
No
I want to talk
You cant
Id better talk to you
No I said I want to talk to you
She came and stood by my bedside and looked me in the eyes
I dontI dont want you to talk to me she said
I thought you couldnt talk
I get few chancesof you
Youd better not talk
Dont talk now
Let me chatter instead
You ought not to talk
It isnt much I said
Id rather you didnt
Im not going to be disfigured I said
Only a scar
Oh
she said as if she had expected something quite different
Did you think youd become a sort of gargoyle
LHomme qui RitI didnt know
But thats all right
Jolly flowers those are
Michaelmas daisies she said
Im glad your not disfigured and those are perennial sunflowers
Do you know no flowers at all
When I saw you on the ground I certainly thought you were dead
You ought to have been by all the rules of the game
She said some other things but I was thinking of my next move
Are we social equals
I said abruptly
She stared at me
Queer question she said
But are we
Hm
Difficult to say
But why do you ask
Is the daughter of a courtesy Baron who diedof general disreputableness I believebefore his father
I give it up
Does it matter
No
My mind is confused
I want to know if you will marry me
She whitened and said nothing
I suddenly felt I must plead with her
Damn these bandages
I said breaking into ineffectual febrile rage
She roused herself to her duties as nurse
What are you doing
Why are you trying to sit up
Sit down
Dont touch your bandages
I told you not to talk
She stood helpless for a moment then took me firmly by the shoulders and pushed me back upon the pillow
She gripped the wrist of the hand I had raised to my face
I told you not to talk she whispered close to my face
I asked you not to talk
Why couldnt you do as I asked you
Youve been avoiding me for a month I said
I know
You might have known
Put your hand backdown by your side
I obeyed
She sat on the edge of the bed
A flush had come to her cheeks and her eyes were very bright
I asked you she repeated not to talk
My eyes questioned her mutely
She put her hand on my chest
Her eyes were tormented
How can I answer you now
she said
How can I say anything now
What do you mean
I asked
She made no answer
Do you mean it must be No
She nodded
But I said and my whole soul was full of accusations
I know she said
I cant explain
I cant
But it has to be No
It cant be
Its utterly finally for ever impossible Keep your hands still
But I said when we met again I cant marry
I cant and wont
She stood up
Why did you talk
she cried couldnt you SEE
She seemed to have something it was impossible to say
She came to the table beside my bed and pulled the Michaelmas daisies awry
Why did you talk like that
she said in a tone of infinite bitterness
To begin like that
But what is it
I said
Is it some circumstancemy social position
Oh DAMN your social position
she cried
She went and stood at the further window staring out at the rain
For a long time we were absolutely still
The wind and rain came in little gusts upon the pane
She turned to me abruptly
You didnt ask me if I loved you she said
Oh if its THAT
said I
Its not that she said
But if you want to know She paused
I do she said
We stared at one another
I dowith all my heart if you want to know
Then why the devil
I asked
She made no answer
She walked across the room to the piano and began to play rather noisily and rapidly with odd gusts of emphasis the shepherds pipe music from the last act in Tristan and Isolde
Presently she missed a note failed again ran her finger heavily up the scale struck the piano passionately with her fist making a feeble jar in the treble jumped up and went out of the room
The nurse found me still wearing my helmet of bandages partially dressed and pottering round the room to find the rest of my clothes
I was in a state of exasperated hunger for Beatrice and I was too inflamed and weakened to conceal the state of my mind
I was feebly angry because of the irritation of dressing and particularly of the struggle to put on my trousers without being able to see my legs
I was staggering about and once I had fallen over a chair and I had upset the jar of Michaelmas daisies
I must have been a detestable spectacle
Ill go back to bed said I if I may have a word with Miss Beatrice
Ive got something to say to her
Thats why Im dressing
My point was conceded but there were long delays
Whether the household had my ultimatum or whether she told Beatrice directly I do not know and what Lady Osprey can have made of it in the former case I dont imagine
At last Beatrice came and stood by my bedside
Well
she said
All I want to say I said with the querulous note of a misunderstood child is that I cant take this as final
I want to see you and talk when Im better and write
I cant do anything now
I cant argue
I was overtaken with selfpity and began to snivel I cant rest
You see
I cant do anything
She sat down beside me again and spoke softly
I promise I will talk it all over with you again
When you are well
I promise I will meet you somewhere so that we can talk
You cant talk now
I asked you not to talk now
All you want to know you shall know Will that do
Id like to know She looked round to see the door was closed stood up and went to it
Then she crouched beside me and began whispering very softly and rapidly with her face close to me
Dear she said I love you
If it will make you happy to marry me I will marry you
I was in a mood just nowa stupid inconsiderate mood
Of course I will marry you
You are my prince my king
Women are such things of moodor I would have behaved differently
We say No when we mean Yesand fly into crises
So now Yesyesyes
I will
I cant even kiss you
Give me your hand to kiss that
Understand I am yours
Do you understand
I am yours just as if we had been married fifty years
Your wifeBeatrice
Is that enough
Nownow will you rest
Yes I said but why
There are complications
There are difficulties
When you are better you will be able tounderstand them
But now they dont matter
Only you know this must be secretfor a time
Absolutely secret between us
Will you promise that
Yes I said I understand
I wish I could kiss you
She laid her head down beside mine for a moment and then she kissed my hand
I dont care what difficulties there are I said and I shut my eyes
VII But I was only beginning to gauge the unaccountable elements in Beatrice
For a week after my return to Lady Grove I had no sign of her and then she called with Lady Osprey and brought a huge bunch of perennial sunflowers and Michaelmas daisies just the old flowers there were in your room said my aunt with a relentless eye on me
I didnt get any talk alone with Beatrice then and she took occasion to tell us she was going to London for some indefinite number of weeks
I couldnt even pledge her to write to me and when she did it was a brief enigmatical friendly letter with not a word of the reality between us
I wrote back a love lettermy first love letterand she made no reply for eight days
Then came a scrawl I cant write letters
Wait till we can talk
Are you better
I think the reader would be amused if he could see the papers on my desk as I write all this the mangled and disfigured pages the experimental arrangements of notes the sheets of suggestions balanced in constellations the blottesque intellectual battlegrounds over which I have been fighting
I find this account of my relations to Beatrice quite the most difficult part of my story to write
I happen to be a very objectiveminded person I forget my moods and this was so much an affair of moods
And even such moods and emotions as I recall are very difficult to convey
To me it is about as difficult as describing a taste or a scent
Then the objective story is made up of little things that are difficult to set in a proper order
And love in an hysterical passion now high now low now exalted and now intensely physical
No one has ever yet dared to tell a love story completely its alternations its comings and goings its debased moments its hate
The love stories we tell tell only the net consequence the ruling effect How can I rescue from the past now the mystical quality of Beatrice my intense longing for her the overwhelming irrational formless desire
How can I explain how intimately that worship mingled with a high impatient resolve to make her mine to take her by strength and courage to do my loving in a violent heroic manner
And then the doubts the puzzled arrest at the fact of her fluctuations at her refusal to marry me at the fact that even when at last she returned to Bedley Corner she seemed to evade me
That exasperated me and perplexed me beyond measure
I felt that it was treachery
I thought of every conceivable explanation and the most exalted and romantic confidence in her did not simply alternate but mingled with the basest misgivings
And into the tangle of memories comes the figure of Carnaby coming out slowly from the background to a position of significance as an influence as a predominant strand in the nets that kept us apart as a rival
What were the forces that pulled her away from me when it was so clearly manifest she loved me
Did she think of marrying him
Had I invaded some longplanned scheme
It was evident he did not like me that in some way I spoilt the world for him
She returned to Bedley Corner and for some weeks she was flitting about me and never once could I have talk with her alone
When she came to my sheds Carnaby was always with her jealously observant
Why the devil couldnt she send him about his business
The days slipped by and my anger gathered
All this mingles with the making of Lord Roberts B I had resolved upon that one night as I lay awake at Bedley Corner I got it planned out before the bandages were off my face
I conceived this second navigable balloon in a grandiose manner
It was to be a second Lord Roberts A only more so it was to be three times as big large enough to carry three men and it was to be an altogether triumphant vindication of my claims upon the air
The framework was to be hollow like a birds bones airtight and the air pumped in or out and the weight of fuel I carried changed
I talked much and boasted to Cothopewhom I suspected of scepticisms about this new typeof what it would do and it progressedslowly
It progressed slowly because I was restless and uncertain
At times I would go away to London to snatch some chance of seeing Beatrice there at times nothing but a day of gliding and hard and dangerous exercise would satisfy me
And now in the newspapers in conversation in everything about me arose a new invader of my mental states
Something was happening to the great schemes of my uncles affairs people were beginning to doubt to question
It was the first quiver of his tremendous insecurity the first wobble of that gigantic credit top he had kept spinning so long
There were comings and goings November and December slipped by
I had two unsatisfactory meetings with Beatrice meetings that had no privacyin which we said things of the sort that need atmosphere baldly and furtively
I wrote to her several times and she wrote back notes that I would sometimes respond to altogether sometimes condemn as insincere evasions
You dont understand
I cant just now explain
Be patient with me
Leave things a little while to me
She wrote
I would talk aloud to these notes and wrangle over them in my workroomwhile the plans of Lord Roberts B waited
You dont give me a chance
I would say
Why dont you let me know the secret
Thats what Im forto settle difficulties
to tell difficulties to
And at last I could hold out no longer against these accumulating pressures
I took an arrogant outrageous line that left her no loopholes I behaved as though we were living in a melodrama
You must come and talk to me I wrote or I will come and take you
I want youand the time runs away
We met in a ride in the upper plantations
It must have been early in January for there was snow on the ground and on the branches of the trees
We walked to and fro for an hour or more and from the first I pitched the key high in romance and made understandings impossible
It was our worst time together
I boasted like an actor and she I know not why was tired and spiritless
Now I think over that talk in the light of all that has happened since I can imagine how she came to me full of a human appeal I was too foolish to let her make
I dont know
I confess I have never completely understood Beatrice
I confess I am still perplexed at many things she said and did
That afternoon anyhow I was impossible
I posed and scolded
I wasI said itfor taking the Universe by the throat
If it was only that she said but though I heard I did not heed her
At last she gave way to me and talked no more
Instead she looked at meas a thing beyond her controlling but none the less interestingmuch as she had looked at me from behind the skirts of Lady Drew in the Warren when we were children together
Once even I thought she smiled faintly
What are the difficulties I cried
theres no difficulty I will not overcome for you
Do your people think Im no equal for you
Who says it
My dear tell me to win a title
Ill do it in five years
Here am I just grown a man at the sight of you
I have wanted something to fight for
Let me fight for you
Im rich without intending it
Let me mean it give me an honourable excuse for it and Ill put all this rotten old Warren of England at your feet
I said such things as that
I write them down here in all their resounding base pride
I said these empty and foolish things and they are part of me
Why should I still cling to pride and be ashamed
I shouted her down
I passed from such megalomania to petty accusations
You think Carnaby is a better man than I
I said
No
she cried stung to speech
No
You think were unsubstantial
Youve listened to all these rumours Boom has started because we talked of a newspaper of our own
When you are with me you know Im a man when you get away from me you think Im a cheat and a cad
Theres not a word of truth in the things they say about us
Ive been slack
Ive left things
But we have only to exert ourselves
You do not know how wide and far we have spread our nets
Even now we have a coupan expeditionin hand
It will put us on a footing
Her eyes asked mutely and asked in vain that I would cease to boast of the very qualities she admired in me
In the night I could not sleep for thinking of that talk and the vulgar things I had said in it
I could not understand the drift my mind had taken
I was acutely disgusted
And my unwonted doubts about myself spread from a merely personal discontent to our financial position
It was all very well to talk as I had done of wealth and power and peerages but what did I know nowadays of my uncles position
Suppose in the midst of such boasting and confidence there came some turn I did not suspect some rottenness he had concealed from me
I resolved I had been playing with aeronautics long enough that next morning I would go to him and have things clear between us
I caught an early train and went up to the Hardingham
I went up to the Hardingham through a dense London fog to see how things really stood
Before I had talked to my uncle for ten minutes I felt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak inhospitable room out of a grandiose dream
CHAPTER THE FOURTH HOW I STOLE THE HEAPS OF QUAP FROM MORDET ISLAND I We got to make a fight for it said my uncle
We got to face the music
I remember that even at the sight of him I had a sense of impending calamity
He sat under the electric light with the shadow of his hair making bars down his face
He looked shrunken and as though his skin had suddenly got loose and yellow
The decorations of the room seemed to have lost freshness and outside the blinds were upthere was not so much fog as a dun darkness
One saw the dingy outlines of the chimneys opposite quite distinctly and then a sky of such brown as only London can display
I saw a placard I said More Ponderevity
Thats Boom he said
Boom and his damned newspapers
Hes trying to fight me down
Ever since I offered to buy the Daily Decorator hes been at me
And he thinks consolidating Do Ut cut down the ads
He wants everything damn him
Hes got no sense of dealing
Id like to bash his face
Well I said whats to be done
Keep going said my uncle
Ill smash Boom yet he said with sudden savagery
Nothing else
I asked
We got to keep going
Theres a scare on
Did you notice the rooms
Half the people out there this morning are reporters
And if I talk they touch it up
They didnt used to touch things up
Now they put in character touchesinsulting you
Dont know what journalisms coming to
Its all Booms doing
He cursed Lord Boom with considerable imaginative vigour
Well said I what can he do
Shove us up against time George make money tight for us
We been handling a lot of moneyand he tightens us up
Were sound
Oh were sound George
Trust me for that
But all the same Theres such a lot of imagination in these things Were sound enough
Thats not it
He blew
Damn Boom
he said and his eyes over his glasses met mine defiantly
We cant I suppose run close hauled for a bitstop expenditure
Where
WellCrest Hill What
he shouted
Me stop Crest Hill for Boom
He waved a fist as if to hit his inkpot and controlled himself with difficulty
He spoke at last in a reasonable voice
If I did he said hed kick up a fuss
Its no good even if I wanted to
Everybodys watching the place
If I was to stop building wed be down in a week
He had an idea
I wish I could do something to start a strike or something
No such luck
Treat those workmen a sight too well
No sink or swim Crest Hill goes on until were under water
I began to ask questions and irritated him instantly
Oh dash these explanations George
he cried You only make things look rottener than they are
Its your way
It isnt a case of figures
Were all righttheres only one thing we got to do
Yes
Show value George
Thats where this quap comes in thats why I fell in so readily with what you brought to me week before last
Here we are we got our option on the perfect filament and all we wants canadium
Nobody knows theres more canadium in the world than will go on the edge of a sixpence except me and you
Nobody has an idee the perfect filaments more than just a bit of theorising
Fifty tons of quap and wed turn that bit of theorising into something
Wed make the lamp trade sit on its tail and howl
Wed put Ediswan and all of em into a parcel withour last years trousers and a hat and swap em off for a pot ofgeraniums
See
Wed do it through Business Organisations and there you are
See
Caperns Patent Filament
The Ideal and the Real
George well do it
Well bring it off
And then well give such a facer to Boom hell think for fifty years
Hes laying up for our London and African meeting
Let him
He can turn the whole paper on to us
He says the Business Organisations shares arent worth fiftytwo and we quote em at eightyfour
Well here we are gettin ready for himloading our gun
His pose was triumphant
Yes I said thats all right
But I cant help thinking where should we be if we hadnt just by accident got Caperns Perfect Filament
Because you know it was an accidentmy buying up that
He crumpled up his nose into an expression of impatient distaste at my unreasonableness
And after all the meetings in June and you havent begun to get the quap
After all weve still got to load our gun
They start on Toosday
Have they got the brig
Theyve got a brig
GordonNasmyth
I doubted
Safe as a bank he said
More I see of that man the more I like him
All I wish is wed got a steamer instead of a sailing ship And I went on you seem to overlook what used to weigh with us a bit
This canadium side of the business and the Capern chance has rushed you off your legs
After allits stealing and in its way an international outrage
Theyve got two gunboats on the coast
I jumped up and went and stared out at the fog
And by Jove its about our only chance
I didnt dream
I turned on him
Ive been up in the air I said
Heaven knows where I havent been
And heres our only chanceand you give it to that adventurous lunatic to play in his own wayin a brig
Well you had a voice I wish Id been in this before
We ought to have run out a steamer to Lagos or one of those West Coast places and done it from there
Fancy a brig in the channel at this time of year if it blows southwest
I dessay youd have shoved it George
Still you know George
I believe in him
Yes I said
Yes I believe in him too
In a way
Still We took up a telegram that was lying on his desk and opened it
His face became a livid yellow
He put the flimsy paper down with a slow reluctant movement and took off his glasses
George he said the lucks against us
What
He grimaced with his mouthin the queerest way at the telegram
That
I took it up and read Motor smash compound fracture of the leg gordon nasmyth what price mordet now For a moment neither of us spoke
Thats all right I said at last
Eh
said my uncle
IM going
Ill get that quap or bust
II I had a ridiculous persuasion that I was saving the situation
Im going I said quite consciously and dramatically
I saw the whole affairhow shall I put itin American colours
I sat down beside him
Give me all the data youve got I said and Ill pull this thing off
But nobody knows exactly where Nasmyth does and hell tell me
Hes been very close said my uncle and regarded me
Hell tell me all right now hes smashed
He thought
I believe he will
George he said if you pull this thing offOnce or twice before youve stepped inwith that sort of Woosh of yours He left the sentence unfinished
Give me that notebook I said and tell me all you know
Wheres the ship
Wheres Pollack
And wheres that telegram from
If that quaps to be got Ill get it or bust
If youll hold on here until I get back with it
And so it was I jumped into the wildest adventure of my life
I requisitioned my uncles best car forthwith
I went down that night to the place of despatch named on Nasmyths telegram Bampton SO
Oxon routed him out with a little trouble from that centre made things right with him and got his explicit directions and I was inspecting the Maud Mary with young Pollack his cousin and aide the following afternoon
She was rather a shock to me and not at all in my style a beast of a brig inured to the potato trade and she reeked from end to end with the faint subtle smell of raw potatoes so that it prevailed even over the temporary smell of new paint
She was a beast of a brig all hold and dirty framework and they had ballasted her with old iron and old rails and iron sleepers and got a miscellaneous lot of spades and iron wheelbarrows against the loading of the quap
I thought her over with Pollack one of those tall blond young men who smoke pipes and dont help much and then by myself and as a result I did my best to sweep Gravesend clean of wheeling planks and got in as much cord and small rope as I could for lashing
I had an idea we might need to run up a jetty
In addition to much ballast she held remotely hidden in a sort of inadvertent way a certain number of ambiguous cases which I didnt examine but which I gathered were a provision against the need of a trade
The captain was a most extraordinary creature under the impression we were after copper ore he was a Roumanian Jew with twitching excitable features who had made his way to a certificate after some preliminary naval experiences in the Black Sea
The mate was an Essex man of impenetrable reserve
The crew were astoundingly illclad and destitute and dirty most of them youths unwashed out of colliers
One the cook was a mulatto and one the bestbuilt fellow of them all was a Breton
There was some subterfuge about our position on boardI forget the particulars nowI was called the supercargo and Pollack was the steward
This added to the piratical flavour that insufficient funds and GordonNasmyths original genius had already given the enterprise
Those two days of bustle at Gravesend under dingy skies in narrow dirty streets were a new experience for me
It is like nothing else in my life
I realised that I was a modern and a civilised man
I found the food filthy and the coffee horrible the whole town stank in my nostrils the landlord of the Good Intent on the quay had a standup quarrel with us before I could get even a hot bath and the bedroom I slept in was infested by a quantity of exotic but voracious flat parasites called locally bugs in the walls in the woodwork everywhere
I fought them with insect powder and found them comatose in the morning
I was dipping down into the dingy underworld of the contemporary state and I liked it no better than I did my first dip into it when I stayed with my Uncle Nicodemus Frapp at the bakery at Chathamwhere bytheby we had to deal with cockroaches of a smaller darker variety and also with bugs of sorts
Let me confess that through all this time before we started I was immensely selfconscious and that Beatrice played the part of audience in my imagination throughout
I was as I say saving the situation and I was acutely aware of that
The evening before we sailed instead of revising our medicinechest as I had intended I took the car and ran across country to Lady Grove to tell my aunt of the journey I was making dress and astonish Lady Osprey by an after dinner call
The two ladies were at home and alone beside a big fire that seemed wonderfully cheerful after the winter night
I remember the effect of the little parlour in which they sat as very bright and domestic
Lady Osprey in a costume of mauve and lace sat on a chintz sofa and played an elaborately spreadout patience by the light of a tall shaded lamp Beatrice in a whiteness that showed her throat smoked a cigarette in an armchair and read with a lamp at her elbow
The room was whitepanelled and chintzcurtained
About those two bright centres of light were warm dark shadow in which a circular mirror shone like a pool of brown water
I carried off my raid by behaving like a slave of etiquette
There were moments when I think I really made Lady Osprey believe that my call was an unavoidable necessity that it would have been negligent of me not to call just how and when I did
But at the best those were transitory moments
They received me with disciplined amazement
Lady Osprey was interested in my face and scrutinised the scar
Beatrice stood behind her solicitude
Our eyes met and in hers I could see startled interrogations
Im going I said to the west coast of Africa
They asked questions but it suited my mood to be vague
Weve interests there
It is urgent I should go
I dont know when I may return
After that I perceived Beatrice surveyed me steadily
The conversation was rather difficult
I embarked upon lengthy thanks for their kindness to me after my accident
I tried to understand Lady Ospreys game of patience but it didnt appear that Lady Osprey was anxious for me to understand her patience
I came to the verge of taking my leave You neednt go yet said Beatrice abruptly
She walked across to the piano took a pile of music from the cabinet near surveyed Lady Ospreys back and with a gesture to me dropped it all deliberately on to the floor
Must talk she said kneeling close to me as I helped her to pick it up
Turn my pages
At the piano
I cant read music
Turn my pages
Presently we were at the piano and Beatrice was playing with noisy inaccuracy
She glanced over her shoulder and Lady Osprey had resumed her patience
The old lady was very pink and appeared to be absorbed in some attempt to cheat herself without our observing it
Isnt West Africa a vile climate
Are you going to live there
Why are you going
Beatrice asked these questions in a low voice and gave me no chance to answer
Then taking a rhythm from the music before her she said At the back of the house is a gardena door in the wallon the lane
Understand
I turned over the pages without any effect on her playing
When
I asked
She dealt in chords
I wish I COULD play this
she said
Midnight
She gave her attention to the music for a time
You may have to wait
Ill wait
She brought her playing to an end byas school boys saystashing it up
I cant play tonight she said standing up and meeting my eyes
I wanted to give you a parting voluntary
Was that Wagner Beatrice
asked Lady Osprey looking up from her cards
It sounded very confused
I took my leave
I had a curious twinge of conscience as I parted from Lady Osprey
Either a first intimation of middleage or my inexperience in romantic affairs was to blame but I felt a very distinct objection to the prospect of invading this good ladys premises from the garden door
I motored up to the pavilion found Cothope reading in bed told him for the first time of West Africa spent an hour with him in settling all the outstanding details of Lord Roberts B and left that in his hands to finish against my return
I sent the motor back to Lady Grove and still wearing my fur coatfor the January night was damp and bitterly coldwalked to Bedley Corner
I found the lane to the back of the Dower House without any difficulty and was at the door in the wall with ten minutes to spare
I lit a cigar and fell to walking up and down
This queer flavour of intrigue this nocturnal gardendoor business had taken me by surprise and changed my mental altitudes
I was startled out of my egotistical pose and thinking intently of Beatrice of that elfin quality in her that always pleased me that always took me by surprise that had made her for example so instantly conceive this meeting
She came within a minute of midnight the door opened softly and she appeared a short grey figure in a motorcoat of sheepskin bareheaded to the cold drizzle
She flitted up to me and her eyes were shadows in her dusky face
Why are you going to West Africa
she asked at once
Business crisis
I have to go
Youre not going
Youre coming back
Three or four months I said at most
Then its nothing to do with me
Nothing I said
Why should it have
Oh thats all right
One never knows what people think or what people fancy
She took me by the arm Lets go for a walk she said
I looked about me at darkness and rain
Thats all right she laughed
We can go along the lane and into the Old Woking Road
Do you mind
Of course you dont
My head
It doesnt matter
One never meets anybody
How do you know
Ive wandered like this before Of course
Did you thinkshe nodded her head back at her homethats all
No by Jove
I cried its manifest it isnt
She took my arm and turned me down the lane
Nights my time she said by my side
Theres a touch of the werewolf in my blood
One never knows in these old families
Ive wondered often
Here we are anyhow alone in the world
Just darkness and cold and a sky of clouds and wet
And wetogether
I like the wet on my face and hair dont you
When do you sail
I told her tomorrow
Oh well theres no tomorrow now
You and I
She stopped and confronted me
You dont say a word except to answer
No I said
Last time you did all the talking
Like a fool
Now We looked at each others two dim faces
Youre glad to be here
Im gladIm beginning to beits more than glad
She put her hands on my shoulders and drew me down to kiss her
Ah
she said and for a moment or so we just clung to one another
Thats all she said releasing herself
What bundles of clothes we are tonight
I felt we should kiss some day again
Always
The last time was ages ago
Among the fern stalks
Among the bracken
You remember
And your lips were cold
Were mine
The same lipsafter so longafter so much
And now lets trudge through this blottedout world together for a time
Yes let me take your arm
Just trudge
See
Hold tight to me because I know the wayand dont talkdont talk
Unless you want to talk Let me tell you things
You see dear the whole world is blotted outits dead and gone and were in this place
This dark wild place Were dead
Or all the world is dead
No
Were dead
No one can see us
Were shadows
Weve got out of our positions out of our bodiesand together
Thats the good thing of ittogether
But thats why the world cant see us and why we hardly see the world
Sssh
Is it all right
Its all right I said
We stumbled along for a time in a close silence
We passed a dimlit rainveiled window
The silly world she said the silly world
It eats and sleeps
If the wet didnt patter so from the trees wed hear it snoring
Its dreaming such stupid thingsstupid judgments
It doesnt know we are passing we twofree of itclear of it
You and I
We pressed against each other reassuringly
Im glad were dead she whispered
Im glad were dead
I was tired of it dear
I was so tired of it dear and so entangled
She stopped abruptly
We splashed through a string of puddles
I began to remember things I had meant to say
Look here
I cried
I want to help you beyond measure
You are entangled
What is the trouble
I asked you to marry me
You said you would
But theres something
My thoughts sounded clumsy as I said them
Is it something about my position
Or is it somethingperhapsabout some other man
There was an immense assenting silence
Youve puzzled me so
At firstI mean quite earlyI thought you meant to make me marry you
I did
And then
Tonight she said after a long pause I cant explain
No
I cant explain
I love you
Butexplanations
Tonight my dear here we are in the world aloneand the world doesnt matter
Nothing matters
Here I am in the cold with you and my bed away there deserted
Id tell youI will tell you when things enable me to tell you and soon enough they will
But tonightI wontI wont
She left my side and went in front of me
She turned upon me
Look here she said I insist upon your being dead
Do you understand
Im not joking
Tonight you and I are out of life
Its our time together
There may be other times but this we wont spoil
Werein Hades if you like
Where theres nothing to hide and nothing to tell
No bodies even
No bothers
We loved each otherdown thereand were kept apart but now it doesnt matter
Its over
If you wont agree to thatI will go home
I wanted I began
I know
Oh
my dear if youd only understand I understand
If youd only not careand love me tonight
I do love you I said
Then LOVE me she answered and leave all the things that bother you
Love me
Here I am
But No
she said
Well have your way
So she carried her point and we wandered into the night together and Beatrice talked to me of love
Id never heard a woman before in all my life who could talk of love who could lay bare and develop and touch with imagination all that mass of fine emotion every woman it may be hides
She had read of love she had thought of love a thousand sweet lyrics had sounded through her brain and left fine fragments in her memory she poured it out all of it shamelessly skilfully for me
I cannot give any sense of that talk I cannot even tell how much of the delight of it was the magic of her voice the glow of her near presence
And always we walked swathed warmly through a chilly air along dim interminable greasy roadswith never a soul abroad it seemed to us never a beast in the fields
Why do people love each other
I said
Why not
But why do I love you
Why is your voice better than any voice your face sweeter than any face
And why do I love you
she asked not only what is fine in you but what isnt
Why do I love your dullness your arrogance
For I do
Tonight I love the very raindrops on the fur of your coat
So we talked and at last very wet still glowing but a little tired we parted at the garden door
We had been wandering for two hours in our strange irrational community of happiness and all the world about us and particularly Lady Osprey and her household had been asleepand dreaming of anything rather than Beatrice in the night and rain
She stood in the doorway a muffled figure with eyes that glowed
Come back she whispered
I shall wait for you
She hesitated
She touched the lapel of my coat
I love you NOW she said and lifted her face to mine
I held her to me and was atremble from top to toe
O God
I cried
And I must go
She slipped from my arms and paused regarding me
For an instant the world seemed full of fantastic possibilities
Yes GO
she said and vanished and slammed the door upon me leaving me alone like a man new fallen from fairyland in the black darkness of the night
III That expedition to Mordet Island stands apart from all the rest of my life detached a piece by itself with an atmosphere of its own
It would I suppose make a book by itselfit has made a fairly voluminous official reportbut so far as this novel of mine goes it is merely an episode a contributory experience and I mean to keep it at that
Vile weather an impatient fretting against unbearable slowness and delay seasickness general discomfort and humiliating selfrevelation are the master values of these memories
I was sick all through the journey out
I dont know why
It was the only time I was ever seasick and I have seen some pretty bad weather since I became a boatbuilder
But that phantom smell of potatoes was peculiarly vile to me
Coming back on the brig we were all ill every one of us so soon as we got to sea poisoned I firmly believe by quap
On the way out most of the others recovered in a few days but the stuffiness below the coarse food the cramped dirty accommodation kept me if not actually seasick in a state of acute physical wretchedness the whole time
The ship abounded in cockroaches and more intimate vermin
I was cold all the time until after we passed Cape Verde then I became steamily hot I had been too preoccupied with Beatrice and my keen desire to get the Maud Mary under way at once to consider a proper wardrobe for myself and in particular I lacked a coat
Heavens
how I lacked that coat
And moreover I was cooped up with two of the worst bores in Christendom Pollack and the captain
Pollack after conducting his illness in a style better adapted to the capacity of an opera house than a small compartment suddenly got insupportably well and breezy and produced a manly pipe in which he smoked a tobacco as blond as himself and divided his time almost equally between smoking it and trying to clean it
Theres only three things you can clean a pipe with he used to remark with a twist of paper in hand
The bests a feather the seconds a straw and the thirds a girls hairpin
I never see such a ship
You cant find any of em
Last time I came this way I did find hairpins anyway and found em on the floor of the captains cabin
Regular deposit
Eh
Feelin better
At which I usually swore
Oh youll be all right soon
Dont mind my puffin a bit
Eh
He never tired of asking me to have a hand at Nap
Good game
Makes you forget it and thats half the battle
He would sit swaying with the rolling of the ship and suck at his pipe of blond tobacco and look with an inexpressibly sage but somnolent blue eye at the captain by the hour together
Captains a Card he would say over and over again as the outcome of these meditations
Hed like to know what were up to
Hed like to knowno end
That did seem to be the captains ruling idea
But he also wanted to impress me with the notion that he was a gentleman of good family and to air a number of views adverse to the English to English literature to the English constitution and the like
He had learnt the sea in the Roumanian navy and English out of a book he would still at times pronounce the es at the end of there and here he was a naturalised Englishman and he drove me into a reluctant and uncongenial patriotism by his everlasting carping at things English
Pollack would set himself to draw him out
Heaven alone can tell how near I came to murder
Fiftythree days I had outward cooped up with these two and a shy and profoundly depressed mate who read the Bible on Sundays and spent the rest of his leisure in lethargy three and fifty days of life cooped up in a perpetual smell in a persistent sick hunger that turned from the sight of food in darkness cold and wet in a lightly ballasted ship that rolled and pitched and swayed
And all the time the sands in the hourglass of my uncles fortunes were streaming out
Misery
Amidst it all I remember only one thing brightly one morning of sunshine in the Bay of Biscay and a vision of frothing waves sapphire green a bird following our wake and our masts rolling about the sky
Then wind and rain close in on us again
You must not imagine they were ordinary days days I mean of an average length they were not so much days as long damp slabs of time that stretched each one to the horizon and much of that length was night
One paraded the staggering deck in a borrowed souwester hour after hour in the chilly windy splashing and spitting darkness or sat in the cabin bored and ill and looked at the faces of those inseparable companions by the help of a lamp that gave smell rather than light
Then one would see going up up up and then sinking down down down Pollack extinct pipe in mouth humorously observant bringing his mind slowly to the seventyseventh decision that the captain was a Card while the words flowed from the latter in a nimble incessant good
Dis England eet is not a country aristocratic no
Eet is a glorified bourgeoisie
Eet is plutocratic
In England dere is no aristocracy since de Wars of Roses
In the rest of Europe east of the Latins yes in England no
Eet is all middleclass youra England
Everything you look at middleclass
Respectable
Everything goodeet is you say shocking
Madame Grundy
Eet is all limited and computing and selfseeking
Dat is why your art is so limited youra fiction your philosophin why you are all so inartistic
You want nothing but profit
What will pay
What would you
He had all those violent adjuncts to speech we Western Europeans have abandoned shruggings of the shoulders waving of the arms thrusting out of the face wonderful grimaces and twiddlings of the hands under your nose until you wanted to hit them away
Day after day it went on and I had to keep any anger to myself to reserve myself for the time ahead when it would be necessary to see the quap was got aboard and stowedknee deep in this mans astonishment
I knew he would make a thousand objections to all we had before us
He talked like a drugged man
It ran glibly over his tongue
And all the time one could see his seamanship fretting him he was gnawed by responsibility perpetually uneasy about the ships position perpetually imagining dangers
If a sea hit us exceptionally hard hed be out of the cabin in an instant making an outcry of inquiries and he was pursued by a dread of the hold of ballast shifting of insidious wicked leaks
As we drew near the African coast his fear of rocks and shoals became infectious
I do not know dis coast he used to say
I cama hera because GordonNasmyth was coming too
Den he does not come
Fortunes of war I said and tried to think in vain if any motive but sheer haphazard could have guided GordonNasmyth in the choice of these two men
I think perhaps GordonNasmyth had the artistic temperament and wanted contrasts and also that the captain helped him to express his own malignant AntiBritishism
He was indeed an exceptionally inefficient captain
On the whole I was glad I had come even at the eleventh hour to see to things
The captain bytheby did at last out of sheer nervousness get aground at the end of Mordets Island but we got off in an hour or so with a swell and a little hard work in the boat
I suspected the mate of his opinion of the captain long before he expressed it
He was I say a taciturn man but one day speech broke through him
He had been sitting at the table with his arms folded on it musing drearily pipe in mouth and the voice of the captain drifted down from above
The mate lifted his heavy eyes to me and regarded me for a moment
Then he began to heave with the beginnings of speech
He disembarrassed himself of his pipe
I cowered with expectation
Speech was coming at last
Before he spoke he nodded reassuringly once or twice
E He moved his head strangely and mysteriously but a child might have known he spoke of the captain
Es a foreigner
He regarded me doubtfully for a time and at last decided for the sake of lucidity to clench the matter
Thats what E isa DAGO
He nodded like a man who gives a last tap to a nail and I could see he considered his remark well and truly laid
His face though still resolute became as tranquil and uneventful as a huge hall after a public meeting has dispersed out of it and finally he closed and locked it with his pipe
Roumanian Jew isnt he
I said
He nodded darkly and almost forbiddingly
More would have been too much
The thing was said
But from that time forth I knew I could depend upon him and that he and I were friends
It happens I never did have to depend upon him but that does not affect our relationship
Forward the crew lived lives very much after the fashion of ours more crowded more cramped and dirty wetter steamier more verminous
The coarse food they had was still not so coarse but that they did not think they were living like fighting cocks
So far as I could make out they were all nearly destitute men hardly any of them had a proper sea outfit and what small possessions they had were a source of mutual distrust
And as we pitched and floundered southward they gambled and fought were brutal to one another argued and wrangled loudly until we protested at the uproar
Theres no romance about the sea in a small sailing ship as I saw it
The romance is in the mind of the landsman dreamer
These brigs and schooners and brigantines that still stand out from every little port are relics from an age of petty trade as rotten and obsolescent as a Georgian house that has sunken into a slum
They are indeed just floating fragments of slum much as icebergs are floating fragments of glacier
The civilised man who has learnt to wash who has developed a sense of physical honour of cleanly temperate feeding of time can endure them no more
They pass and the clanking coalwasting steamers will follow them giving place to cleaner finer things
But so it was I made my voyage to Africa and came at last into a world of steamy fogs and a hot smell of vegetable decay and into sound and sight of surf and distant intermittent glimpses of the coast
I lived a strange concentrated life through all that time such a life as a creature must do that has fallen in a well
All my former ways ceased all my old vistas became memories
The situation I was saving was very small and distant now I felt its urgency no more
Beatrice and Lady Grove my uncle and the Hardingham my soaring in the air and my habitual wide vision of swift effectual things became as remote as if they were in some world I had left for ever IV All these African memories stand by themselves
It was for me an expedition into the realms of undisciplined nature out of the world that is ruled by men my first bout with that hot side of our mother that gives you the junglethat cold side that gives you the aireddy I was beginning to know passing well
They are memories woven upon a fabric of sunshine and heat and a constant warm smell of decay
They end in rainsuch rain as I had never seen before a vehement a frantic downpouring of water but our first slow passage through the channels behind Mordets Island was in incandescent sunshine
There we go in my memory still a blistered dirty ship with patched sails and a battered mermaid to present Maud Mary sounding and taking thought between high ranks of forest whose trees come out kneedeep at last in the water
There we go with a little breeze on our quarter Mordet Island rounded and the quap it might be within a day of us
Here and there strange blossoms woke the dank intensities of green with a trumpet call of colour
Things crept among the jungle and peeped and dashed back rustling into stillness
Always in the sluggishly drifting opaque water were eddyings and stirrings little rushes of bubbles came chuckling up lightheartedly from this or that submerged conflict and tragedy now and again were crocodiles like a stranded fleet of logs basking in the sun
Still it was by day a dreary stillness broken only by insect sounds and the creaking and flapping of our progress by the calling of the soundings and the captains confused shouts but in the night as we lay moored to a clump of trees the darkness brought a thousand swampy things to life and out of the forest came screaming and howlings screaming and yells that made us glad to be afloat
And once we saw between the tree stems long blazing fires
We passed two or three villages landward and brownblack women and children came and stared at us and gesticulated and once a man came out in a boat from a creek and hailed us in an unknown tongue and so at last we came to a great open place a broad lake rimmed with a desolation of mud and bleached refuse and dead trees free from crocodiles or water birds or sight or sound of any living thing and saw far off even as Nasmyth had described the ruins of the deserted station and hard by two little heaps of buffhued rubbish under a great rib of rock the quap
The forest receded
The land to the right of us fell away and became barren and far on across notch in its backbone was surf and the sea
We took the ship in towards those heaps and the ruined jetty slowly and carefully
The captain came and talked
This is eet
he said
Yes said I
Is eet for trade we have come
This was ironical
No said I
GordonNasmyth would haf told me long ago what it ees for we haf come
Ill tell you now I said
We are going to lay in as close as we can to those two heaps of stuffyou see themunder the rock
Then we are going to chuck all our ballast overboard and take those in
Then were going home
May I presume to askis eet gold
No I said incivilly it isnt
Then what is it
Its stuffof some commercial value
We cant do eet he said
We can I answered reassuringly
We cant he said as confidently
I dont mean what you mean
You know so liddleButdis is forbidden country
I turned on him suddenly angry and met bright excited eyes
For a minute we scrutinised one another
Then I said Thats our risk
Trade is forbidden
But this isnt trade
This things got to be done
His eyes glittered and he shook his head
The brig stood in slowly through the twilight toward this strange scorched and blistered stretch of beach and the man at the wheel strained his ears to listening the lowvoiced angry argument that began between myself and the captain that was presently joined by Pollack
We moored at last within a hundred yards of our goal and all through our dinner and far into the night we argued intermittently and fiercely with the captain about our right to load just what we pleased
I will haf nothing to do with eet he persisted
I wash my hands
It seemed that night as though we argued in vain
If it is not trade he said it is prospecting and mining
That is worse
Any one who knows anythingoutside Englandknows that is worse
We argued and I lost my temper and swore at him
Pollack kept cooler and chewed his pipe watchfully with that blue eye of his upon the captains gestures
Finally I went on deck to cool
The sky was overcast I discovered all the men were in a knot forward staring at the faint quivering luminosity that had spread over the heaps of quap a phosphorescence such as one sees at times on rotting wood
And about the beach east and west there were patches and streaks of something like diluted moonshine
In the small hours I was still awake and turning over scheme after scheme in my mind whereby I might circumvent the captains opposition
I meant to get that quap aboard if I had to kill some one to do it
Never in my life had I been so thwarted
After this intolerable voyage
There came a rap at my cabin door and then it opened and I made out a bearded face
Come in I said and a black voluble figure I could just see obscurely came in to talk in my private ear and fill my cabin with its whisperings and gestures
It was the captain
He too had been awake and thinking things over
He had come to explainenormously
I lay there hating him and wondering if I and Pollack could lock him in his cabin and run the ship without him
I do not want to spoil dis expedition emerged from a cloud of protestations and then I was able to disentangle a commissionshush a small commissionfor special risks
Special risks became frequent
I let him explain himself out
It appeared he was also demanding an apology for something I had said
No doubt I had insulted him generously
At last came definite offers
I broke my silence and bargained
Pollack
I cried and hammered the partition
Whats up
asked Pollack
I stated the case concisely
There came a silence
Hes a Card said Pollack
Lets give him his commission
I dont mind
Eh
I cried
I said he was a Card thats all said Pollack
Im coming
He appeared in my doorway a faint white figure joined our vehement whisperings
We had to buy the captain off we had to promise him ten per cent
of our problematical profits
We were to give him ten per cent
on what we sold the cargo for over and above his legitimate pay and I found in my outbargained and disordered state small consolation in the thought that I as the GordonNasmyth expedition was to sell the stuff to myself as Business Organisations
And he further exasperated me by insisting on having our bargain in writing
In the form of a letter he insisted
All right I acquiesced in the form of a letter
Here goes
Get a light
And the apology he said folding up the letter
All right I said Apology
My hand shook with anger as I wrote and afterwards I could not sleep for hate of him
At last I got up
I suffered I found from an unusual clumsiness
I struck my toe against my cabin door and cut myself as I shaved
I found myself at last pacing the deck under the dawn in a mood of extreme exasperation
The sun rose abruptly and splashed light blindingly into my eyes and I swore at the sun
I found myself imagining fresh obstacles with the men and talking aloud in anticipatory rehearsal of the consequent row
The malaria of the quap was already in my blood
V Sooner or later the ridiculous embargo that now lies upon all the coast eastward of Mordet Island will be lifted and the reality of the deposits of quap ascertained
I am sure that we were merely taking the outcrop of a stratum of nodulated deposits that dip steeply seaward
Those heaps were merely the crumbled out contents of two irregular cavities in the rock they are as natural as any talus or heap of that kind and the mud along the edge of the water for miles is mixed with quap and is radioactive and lifeless and faintly phosphorescent at night
But the reader will find the full particulars of my impression of all this in the Geological Magazine for October l905 and to that I must refer him
There too he will find my unconfirmed theories of its nature
If I am right it is something far more significant from the scientific point of view than those incidental constituents of various rare metals pitchblende rutile and the like upon which the revolutionary discoveries of the last decade are based
Those are just little molecular centres of disintegration of that mysterious decay and rotting of those elements elements once regarded as the most stable things in nature
But there is somethingthe only word that comes near it is CANCEROUSand that is not very near about the whole of quap something that creeps and lives as a disease lives by destroying an elemental stirring and disarrangement incalculably maleficent and strange
This is no imaginative comparison of mine
To my mind radioactivity is a real disease of matter
Moreover it is a contagious disease
It spreads
You bring those debased and crumbling atoms near others and those too presently catch the trick of swinging themselves out of coherent existence
It is in matter exactly what the decay of our old culture is in society a loss of traditions and distinctions and assured reactions
When I think of these inexplicable dissolvent centres that have come into being in our globethese quap heaps are surely by far the largest that have yet been found in the world the rest as yet mere specks in grains and crystalsI am haunted by a grotesque fancy of the ultimate eating away and dryrotting and dispersal of all our world
So that while man still struggles and dreams his very substance will change and crumble from beneath him
I mention this here as a queer persistent fancy
Suppose indeed that is to be the end of our planet no splendid climax and finale no towering accumulation of achievements but justatomic decay
I add that to the ideas of the suffocating comet the dark body out of space the burning out of the sun the distorted orbit as a new and far more possible endas Science can see endsto this strange byplay of matter that we call human life
I do not believe this can be the end no human soul can believe in such an end and go on living but to it science points as a possible thing science and reason alike
If single human beingsif one single ricketty infantcan be born as it were by accident and die futile why not the whole race
These are questions I have never answered that now I never attempt to answer but the thought of quap and its mysteries brings them back to me
I can witness that the beach and mud for two miles or more either way was a lifeless beachlifeless as I could have imagined no tropical mud could ever be and all the dead branches and leaves and rotting dead fish and so forth that drifted ashore became presently shrivelled and white
Sometimes crocodiles would come up out of the water and bask and now and then water birds would explore the mud and rocky ribs that rose out of it in a mood of transitory speculation
That was its utmost admiration
And the air felt at once hot and austere dry and blistering and altogether different the warm moist embrace that had met us at our first African landfall and to which we had grown accustomed
I believe that the primary influence of the quap upon us was to increase the conductivity of our nerves but that is a mere unjustifiable speculation on my part
At any rate it gave a sort of east wind effect to life
We all became irritable clumsy languid and disposed to be impatient with our languor
We moored the brig to the rocks with difficulty and got aground on mud and decided to stick there and tow off when we had donethe bottom was as greasy as butter
Our efforts to fix up planks and sleepers in order to wheel the quap aboard were as illconceived as that sort of work can beand that sort of work can at times be very illconceived
The captain had a superstitious fear of his hold he became wildly gesticulatory and expository and incompetent at the bare thought of it
His shouts still echo in my memory becoming as each crisis approached less and less like any known tongue
But I cannot now write the history of those days of blundering and toil of how Milton one of the boys fell from a plank to the beach thirty feet perhaps with his barrow and broke his arm and I believe a rib of how I and Pollack set the limb and nursed him through the fever that followed of how one man after another succumbed to a feverish malaria and how Iby virtue of my scientific reputationwas obliged to play the part of doctor and dose them with quinine and then finding that worse than nothing with rum and small doses of Eastons Syrup of which there chanced to be a case of bottles aboardHeaven and GordonNasmyth know why
For three long days we lay in misery and never shipped a barrowload
Then when they resumed the mens hands broke out into sores
There were no gloves available and I tried to get them while they shovelled and wheeled to cover their hands with stockings or greased rags
They would not do this on account of the heat and discomfort
This attempt of mine did however direct their attention to the quap as the source of their illness and precipitated what in the end finished our lading an informal strike
Weve had enough of this they said and they meant it
They came aft to say as much
They cowed the captain
Through all these days the weather was variously vile first a furnace heat under a sky of a scowling intensity of blue then a hot fog that stuck in ones throat like wool and turned the men on the planks into colourless figures of giants then a wild burst of thunderstorms mad elemental uproar and rain
Through it all against illness heat confusion of mind one master impetus prevailed with me to keep the shipping going to maintain one motif at least whatever else arose or ceased the chuff of the spades the squeaking and shriek of the barrows the pluppa pluppa pluppa as the men came trotting along the swinging high planks and then at last the dollop dollop as the stuff shot into the hold
Another barrowload thank God
Another fifteen hundred or it may be two thousand pounds for the saving of Ponderevo
I found out many things about myself and humanity in those weeks of effort behind Mordet Island
I understand now the heart of the sweater of the harsh employer of the niggerdriver
I had brought these men into a danger they didnt understand I was fiercely resolved to overcome their opposition and bend and use them for my purpose and I hated the men
But I hated all humanity during the time that the quap was near me
And my mind was pervaded too by a sense of urgency and by the fear that we should be discovered and our proceedings stopped
I wanted to get out to sea againto be beating up northward with our plunder
I was afraid our masts showed to seaward and might betray us to some curious passer on the high sea
And one evening near the end I saw a canoe with three natives far off down the lake I got fieldglasses from the captain and scrutinised them and I could see them staring at us
One man might have been a halfbreed and was dressed in white
They watched us for some time very quietly and then paddled off into some channel in the forest shadows
And for three nights running so that it took a painful grip upon my inflamed imagination I dreamt of my uncles face only that it was ghastly white like a clowns and the throat was cut from ear to eara long ochreous cut
Too late he said Too late
VI A day or so after we had got to work upon the quap I found myself so sleepless and miserable that the ship became unendurable
Just before the rush of sunrise I borrowed Pollacks gun walked down the planks clambered over the quap heaps and prowled along the beach
I went perhaps a mile and a half that day and some distance beyond the ruins of the old station
I became interested in the desolation about me and found when I returned that I was able to sleep for nearly an hour
It was delightful to have been alone for so longno captain no Pollack no one
Accordingly I repeated this expedition the next morning and the next until it became a custom with me
There was little for me to do once the digging and wheeling was organised and so these prowlings of mine grew longer and longer and presently I began to take food with me
I pushed these walks far beyond the area desolated by the quap
On the edges of that was first a zone of stunted vegetation then a sort of swampy jungle that was difficult to penetrate and then the beginnings of the forest a scene of huge tree stems and tangled creeper ropes and roots mingled with oozy mud
Here I used to loaf in a state between botanising and reveriealways very anxious to know what was up above in the sunlightand here it was I murdered a man
It was the most unmeaning and purposeless murder imaginable
Even as I write down its wellremembered particulars there comes again the sense of its strangeness its pointlessness its incompatibility with any of the neat and definite theories people hold about life and the meaning of the world
I did this thing and I want to tell of my doing it but why I did it and particularly why I should be held responsible for it I cannot explain
That morning I had come upon a track in the forest and it had occurred to me as a disagreeable idea that this was a human pathway
I didnt want to come upon any human beings
The less our expedition saw of the African population the better for its prospects
Thus far we had been singularly free from native pestering
So I turned back and was making my way over mud and roots and dead fronds and petals scattered from the green world above when abruptly I saw my victim
I became aware of him perhaps forty feet off standing quite still and regarding me
He wasnt by any means a pretty figure
He was very black and naked except for a dirty loincloth his legs were illshaped and his toes spread wide and the upper edge of his cloth and a girdle of string cut his clumsy abdomen into folds
His forehead was low his nose very flat and his lower lip swollen and purplishred
His hair was short and fuzzy and about his neck was a string and a little purse of skin
He carried a musket and a powderflask was stuck in his girdle
It was a curious confrontation
There opposed to him stood I a little soiled perhaps but still a rather elaborately civilised human being born bred and trained in a vague tradition
In my hand was an unaccustomed gun
And each of us was essentially a teeming vivid brain tensely excited by the encounter quite unaware of the others mental content or what to do with him
He stepped back a pace or so stumbled and turned to run
Stop I cried stop you fool
and started to run after him shouting such things in English
But I was no match for him over the roots and mud
I had a preposterous idea
He mustnt get away and tell them
And with that instantly I brought both feet together raised my gun aimed quite coolly drew the trigger carefully and shot him neatly in the back
I saw and saw with a leap of pure exaltation the smash of my bullet between his shoulder blades
Got him said I dropping my gun and down he flopped and died without a groan
By Jove
I cried with note of surprise Ive killed him
I looked about me and then went forward cautiously in a mood between curiosity and astonishment to look at this man whose soul I had flung so unceremoniously out of our common world
I went to him not as one goes to something one has made or done but as one approaches something found
He was frightfully smashed out in front he must have died in the instant
I stooped and raised him by his shoulder and realised that
I dropped him and stood about and peered about me through the trees
My word
I said
He was the second dead human beingapart I mean from surgical properties and mummies and common shows of that sortthat I have ever seen
I stood over him wondering wondering beyond measure
A practical idea came into that confusion
Had any one heard the gun
I reloaded
After a time I felt securer and gave my mind again to the dead I had killed
What must I do
It occurred to me that perhaps I ought to bury him
At any rate I ought to hide him
I reflected coolly and then put my gun within easy reach and dragged him by the arm towards a place where the mud seemed soft and thrust him in
His powderflask slipped from his loincloth and I went back to get it
Then I pressed him down with the butt of my rifle
Afterwards this all seemed to me most horrible but at the time it was entirely a matteroffact transaction
I looked round for any other visible evidence of his fate looked round as one does when one packs ones portmanteau in an hotel bedroom
When I got my bearings and carefully returned towards the ship
I had the mood of grave concentration of a boy who has lapsed into poaching
And the business only began to assume proper proportions for me as I got near the ship to seem any other kind of thing than the killing of a bird or rabbit
In the night however it took on enormous and portentous forms
By God
I cried suddenly starting wide awake but it was murder
I lay after that wide awake staring at my memories
In some odd way these visions mixed up with my dream of in my uncle in his despair
The black body which saw now damaged and partly buried but which nevertheless I no longer felt was dead but acutely alive and perceiving I mixed up with the ochreous slash under my uncles face
I tried to dismiss this horrible obsession from my mind but it prevailed over all my efforts
The next day was utterly black with my sense of that ugly creatures body
I am the least superstitious of men but it drew me
It drew me back into those thickets to the very place where I had hidden him
Some evil and detestable beast had been at him and he lay disinterred
Methodically I buried his swollen and mangled carcass again and returned to the ship for another night of dreams
Next day for all the morning I resisted the impulse to go to him and played nap with Pollack with my secret gnawing at me and in the evening started to go and was near benighted
I never told a soul of them of this thing I had done
Next day I went early and he had gone and there were human footmarks and ugly stains round the muddy hole from which he had been dragged
I returned to the ship disconcerted and perplexed
That day it was the men came aft with blistered hands and faces and sullen eyes
When they proclaimed through Edwards their spokesman Weve had enough of this and we mean it I answered very readily So have I
Lets go
VII We were none too soon
People had been reconnoitring us the telegraph had been at work and we were not four hours at sea before we ran against the gunboat that had been sent down the coast to look for us and that would have caught us behind the island like a beast in a trap
It was a night of driving cloud that gave intermittent gleams of moonlight the wind and sea were strong and we were rolling along through a drift of rails and mist
Suddenly the world was white with moonshine
The gunboat came out as a long dark shape wallowing on the water to the east
She sighted the Maud Mary at once and fired some sort of popgun to arrest us
The mate turned to me
Shall I tell the captain
The captain be damned said I and we let him sleep through two hours of chase till a rainstorm swallowed us up
Then we changed our course and sailed right across them and by morning only her smoke was showing
We were clear of Africaand with the booty aboard I did not see what stood between us and home
For the first time since I had fallen sick in the Thames my spirits rose
I was seasick and physically disgusted of course but I felt kindly in spite of my qualms
So far as I could calculate then the situation was saved
I saw myself returning triumphantly into the Thames and nothing on earth to prevent old Caperns Perfect Filament going on the market in fortnight
I had the monopoly of electric lamps beneath my feet
I was released from the spell of that bloodstained black body all mixed up with greyblack mud
I was going back to baths and decent food and aeronautics and Beatrice
I was going back to Beatrice and my real life againout of this well into which I had fallen
It would have needed something more than seasickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits rising
I told the captain that I agreed with him that the British were the scum of Europe the westward drift of all the people a disgusting rabble and I lost three pounds by attenuated retail to Pollack at hapenny nap and euchre
And then you know as we got out into the Atlantic this side of Cape Verde the ship began to go to pieces
I dont pretend for one moment to understand what happened
But I think Greiffenhagens recent work on the effects of radium upon ligneous tissue does rather carry out my idea that emanations from quap have rapid rotting effect upon woody fibre
From the first there had been a different feel about the ship and as the big winds and waves began to strain her she commenced leaking
Soon she was leakingnot at any particular point but everywhere
She did not spring a leak I mean but water came in first of all near the decaying edges of her planks and then through them
I firmly believe the water came through the wood
First it began to ooze then to trickle
It was like trying to carry moist sugar in a thin paper bag
Soon we were taking in water as though we had opened a door in her bottom
Once it began the thing went ahead beyond all fighting
For a day or so we did our best and I can still remember in my limbs and back the pumpingthe fatigue in my arms and the memory of a clear little dribble of water that jerked as one pumped and of knocking off and the being awakened to go on again and of fatigue piling up upon fatigue
At last we ceased to think of anything but pumping one became a thing of torment enchanted doomed to pump for ever
I still remember it as pure relief when at last Pollack came to me pipe in mouth
The captain says the damned things going down right now he remarked chewing his mouthpiece
Eh
Good idea
I said
One cant go on pumping for ever
And without hurry or alacrity sullenly and wearily we got into the boats and pulled away from the Maud Mary until we were clear of her and then we stayed resting on our oars motionless upon a glassy sea waiting for her to sink
We were all silent even the captain was silent until she went down
And then he spoke quite mildly in an undertone
Dat is the first ship I haf ever lost And it was not a fair game
It wass not a cargo any man should take
No
I stared at the slow eddies that circled above the departed Maud Mary and the last chance of Business Organisations
I felt weary beyond emotion
I thought of my heroics to Beatrice and my uncle of my prompt ILL go and of all the ineffectual months I had spent after this headlong decision
I was moved to laughter at myself and fate
But the captain and the men did not laugh
The men scowled at me and rubbed their sore and blistered hands and set themselves to row As all the world knows we were picked up by the Union Castle liner Portland Castle
The hairdresser aboard was a wonderful man and he even improvised me a dress suit and produced a clean shirt and warm underclothing
I had a hot bath and dressed and dined and drank a bottle of Burgundy
Now I said are there any newspapers
I want to know whats been happening in the world
My steward gave me what he had but I landed at Plymouth still largely ignorant of the course of events
I shook off Pollack and left the captain and mate in an hotel and the men in a Sailors Home until I could send to pay them off and I made my way to the station
The newspapers I bought the placards I saw all England indeed resounded to my uncles bankruptcy
BOOK THE FOURTH THE AFTERMATH OF TONOBUNGAY CHAPTER THE FIRST THE STICK OF THE ROCKET I That evening I talked with my uncle in the Hardingham for the last time
The atmosphere of the place had altered quite shockingly
Instead of the crowd of importunate courtiers there were just half a dozen uninviting men journalists waiting for an interview
Ropper the big commissionaire was still there but now indeed he was defending my uncle from something more than timewasting intrusions
I found the little man alone in the inner office pretending to work but really brooding
He was looking yellow and deflated
Lord
he said at the sight of me
Youre lean George
It makes that scar of yours show up
We regarded each other gravely for a time
Quap I said is at the bottom of the Atlantic
Theres some billsWeve got to pay the men
Seen the papers
Read em all in the train
At bay he said
I been at bay for a week Yelping round me And me facing the music
Im feelin a bit tired
He blew and wiped his glasses
My stomack isnt what it was he explained
One finds itthese times
How did it all happen George
Your Marconigramit took me in the wind a bit
I told him concisely
He nodded to the paragraphs of my narrative and at the end he poured something from a medicine bottle into a sticky little wineglass and drank it
I became aware of the presence of drugs of three or four small bottles before him among his disorder of papers of a faint elusively familiar odour in the room
Yes he said wiping his lips and recorking the bottle
Youve done your best George
The lucks been against us
He reflected bottle in hand
Sometimes the luck goes with you and sometimes it doesnt
Sometimes it doesnt
And then where are you
Grass in the oven
Fight or no fight
He asked a few questions and then his thoughts came back to his own urgent affairs
I tried to get some comprehensive account of the situation from him but he would not give it
Oh I wish Id had you
I wish Id had you George
Ive had a lot on my hands
Youre clear headed at times
What has happened
Oh
Boominfernal things
Yes buthow
Im just off the sea remember
Itd worry me too much to tell you now
Its tied up in a skein
He muttered something to himself and mused darkly and roused himself to say Besidesyoud better keep out of it
Its getting tight
Get em talking
Go down to Crest Hill and fly
Thats YOUR affair
For a time his manner set free queer anxieties in my brain again
I will confess that that Mordet Island nightmare of mine returned and as I looked at him his hand went out for the drug again
Stomach George he said
I been fightin on that
Every man fights on some thinggives way somewhereshead heart liversomething
Zzzz
Gives way somewhere
Napoleon did at last
All through the Waterloo campaign his stomachit wasnt a stomach
Worse than mine no end
The mood of depression passed as the drug worked within him
His eyes brightened
He began to talk big
He began to dress up the situation for my eyes to recover what he had admitted to me
He put it as a retreat from Russia
There were still the chances of Leipzig
Its a battle Georgea big fight
Were fighting for millions
Ive still chances
Theres still a card or so
I cant tell all my planslike speaking on the stroke
You might I began
I cant George
Its like asking to look at some embryo
You got to wait
I know
In a sort of way I know
But to tell it No
You been away so long
And everythings got complicated
My perception of disastrous entanglements deepened with the rise of his spirits
It was evident that I could only help to tie him up in whatever net was weaving round his mind by forcing questions and explanations upon him
My thoughts flew off at another angle
Hows Aunt Susan
said I I had to repeat the question
His busy whispering lips stopped for a moment and he answered in the note of one who repeats a formula
Shed like to be in the battle with me
Shed like to be here in London
But theres corners I got to turn alone
His eye rested for a moment on the little bottle beside him
And things have happened
You might go down now and talk to her he said in a directer voice
I shall be down tomorrow night I think
He looked up as though he hoped that would end our talk
For the weekend
I asked
For the weekend
Thank God for weekends George
II My return home to Lady Grove was a very different thing from what I had anticipated when I had got out to sea with my load of quap and fancied the PerfectFilament was safe within my grasp
As I walked through the evening light along the downs the summer stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead
There were no lurking workmen any more no cyclists on the high road
Cessation was manifest everywhere
There had been I learnt from my aunt a touching and quite voluntary demonstration when the Crest Hill work had come to an end and the men had drawn their last pay they had cheered my uncle and hooted the contractors and Lord Boom
I cannot now recall the manner in which my aunt and I greeted one another
I must have been very tired there but whatever impression was made has gone out of my memory
But I recall very clearly how we sat at the little round table near the big window that gave on the terrace and dined and talked
I remember her talking of my uncle
She asked after him and whether he seemed well
I wish I could help she said
But Ive never helped him much never
His way of doing things was never mine
And sincesince
Since he began to get so rich hes kept things from me
In the old daysit was different There he isI dont know what hes doing
He wont have me near him Mores kept from me than anyone
The very servants wont let me know
They try and stop the worst of the papersBooms thingsfrom coming upstairs
I suppose theyve got him in a corner George
Poor old Teddy
Poor old Adam and Eve we are
Ficial Receivers with flaming swords to drive us out of our garden
Id hoped wed never have another Trek
Wellanyway it wont be Crest Hill
But its hard on Teddy
He must be in such a mess up there
Poor old chap
I suppose we cant help him
I suppose wed only worry him
Have some more soup Georgewhile there is some
The next day was one of those days of strong perception that stand out clear in ones memory when the common course of days is blurred
I can recall now the awakening in the large familiar room that was always kept for me and how I lay staring at its chintzcovered chairs its spaced fine furniture its glimpse of the cedars without and thought that all this had to end
I have never been greedy for money I have never wanted to be rich but I felt now an immense sense of impending deprivation
I read the newspapers after breakfastI and my aunt togetherand then I walked up to see what Cothope had done in the matter of Lord Roberts B
Never before had I appreciated so acutely the ample brightness of the Lady Grove gardens the dignity and wide peace of all about me
It was one of those warm mornings in late May that have won all the glory of summer without losing the gay delicacy of spring
The shrubbery was bright with laburnum and lilac the beds swarmed with daffodils and narcissi and with lilies of the valley in the shade
I went along the wellkept paths among the rhododendra and through the private gate into the woods where the bluebells and common orchid were in profusion
Never before had I tasted so completely the fine sense of privilege and ownership
And all this has to end I told myself all this has to end
Neither my uncle nor I had made any provision for disaster all we had was in the game and I had little doubt now of the completeness of our ruin
For the first time in my life since he had sent me that wonderful telegram of his I had to consider that common anxiety of mankindEmployment
I had to come off my magic carpet and walk once more in the world
And suddenly I found myself at the cross drives where I had seen Beatrice for the first time after so many years
It is strange but so far as I can recollect I had not thought of her once since I had landed at Plymouth
No doubt she had filled the background of my mind but I do not remember one definite clear thought
I had been intent on my uncle and the financial collapse
It came like a blow in the face now all that too had to end
Suddenly I was filled with the thought of her and a great longing for her
What would she do when she realised our immense disaster
What would she do
How would she take it
It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell Should I perhaps presently happen upon her
I went on through the plantations and out upon the downs and thence I saw Cothope with a new glider of his own design soaring down wind to my old familiar grounding place
To judge by its long rhythm it was a very good glider
Like Cothopes cheek thought I to go on with the research
I wonder if hes keeping notes
But all this will have to stop
He was sincerely glad to see me
Its been a rum go he said
He had been there without wages for a month a man forgotten in the rush of events
I just stuck on and did what I could with the stuff
I got a bit of money of my ownand I said to myself Well here you are with the gear and no one to look after you
You wont get such a chance again my boy not in all your born days
Why not make what you can with it 
Hows Lord Roberts B
Cothope lifted his eyebrows
Ive had to refrain he said
But hes looking very handsome
Gods
I said Id like to get him up just once before we smash
You read the papers
You know were going to smash
Oh
I read the papers
Its scandalous sir such work as ours should depend on things like that
You and I ought to be under the State sir if youll excuse me Nothing to excuse I said
Ive always been a Socialistof a sortin theory
Lets go and have a look at him
How is he
Deflated
Just about quarter full
That last oil glaze of yours holds the gas something beautiful
Hes not lost a cubic metre a week
Cothope returned to Socialism as we went toward the sheds
Glad to think youre a Socialist sir he said its the only civilised state
I been a Socialist some yearsoff the Clarion
Its a rotten scramble this world
It takes the things we make and invent and it plays the silly fool with em
We scientific people well have to take things over and stop all this financing and advertisement and that
Its too silly
Its a noosance
Look at us
Lord Roberts B even in his partially deflated condition in his shed was a fine thing to stare up at
I stood side by side with Cothope regarding him and it was borne in upon me more acutely than ever that all this had to end
I had a feeling just like the feeling of a boy who wants to do wrong that I would use up the stuff while I had it before the creditors descended
I had a queer fancy too I remember that if I could get into the air it would advertise my return to Beatrice
Well fill her I said concisely
Its all ready said Cothope and added as an afterthought unless they cut off the gas
I worked and interested myself with Cothope all the morning and for a time forgot my other troubles
But the thought of Beatrice flooded me slowly and steadily
It became an unintelligent sick longing to see her
I felt that I could not wait for the filling of Lord Roberts B that I must hunt her up and see her soon
I got everything forward and lunched with Cothope and then with the feeblest excuses left him in order to prowl down through the woods towards Bedley Corner
I became a prey to wretched hesitations and diffidence
Ought I to go near her now
I asked myself reviewing all the social abasements of my early years
At last about five I called at the Dower House
I was greeted by their Charlottewith a forbidding eye and a cold astonishment
Both Beatrice and Lady Osprey were out
There came into my head some prowling dream of meeting her
I went along the lane towards Woking the lane down which we had walked five months ago in the wind and rain
I mooned for a time in our former footsteps then swore and turned back across the fields and then conceived a distaste for Cothope and went Downward
At last I found myself looking down on the huge abandoned masses of the Crest Hill house
That gave my mind a twist into a new channel
My uncle came uppermost again
What a strange melancholy emptiness of intention that stricken enterprise seemed in the even evening sunlight what vulgar magnificence and crudity and utter absurdity
It was as idiotic as the pyramids
I sat down on the stile staring at it as though I had never seen that forest of scaffold poles that waste of walls and bricks and plaster and shaped stones that wilderness of broken soil and wheeling tracks and dumps before
It struck me suddenly as the compactest image and sample of all that passes for Progress of all the advertisementinflated spending the aimless building up and pulling down the enterprise and promise of my age
This was our fruit this was what he had done I and my uncle in the fashion of our time
We were its leaders and exponents we were the thing it most flourishingly produced
For this futility in its end for an epoch of such futility the solemn scroll of history had unfolded Great God
I cried but is this Life
For this the armies drilled for this the Law was administered and the prisons did their duty for this the millions toiled and perished in suffering in order that a few of us should build palaces we never finished make billiardrooms under ponds run imbecile walls round irrational estates scorch about the world in motorcars devise flyingmachines play golf and a dozen such foolish games of ball crowd into chattering dinner parties gamble and make our lives one vast dismal spectacle of witless waste
So it struck me then and for a time I could think of no other interpretation
This was Life
It came to me like a revelation a revelation at once incredible and indisputable of the abysmal folly of our being
III I was roused from such thoughts by the sound of footsteps behind me
I turned half hopefulso foolish is a lovers imagination and stopped amazed
It was my uncle
His face was whitewhite as I had seen it in my dream
Hullo
I said and stared
Why arent you in London
Its all up he said
Adjudicated
No
I stared at him for a moment and then got off the stile
We stood swaying and then came forward with a weak motion of his arms like a man who cannot see distinctly and caught at and leant upon the stile
For a moment we were absolutely still
He made a clumsy gesture towards the great futility below and choked
I discovered that his face was wet with tears that his wet glasses blinded him
He put up his little fat hand and clawed them off clumsily felt inefficiently for his pockethandkerchief and then to my horror as he clung to me he began to weep aloud this little old worldworn swindler
It wasnt just sobbing or shedding tears it was crying as a child cries
It was oh
terrible
Its cruel he blubbered at last
They asked me questions
They KEP asking me questions George
He sought for utterance and spluttered
The Bloody bullies
he shouted
The Bloody Bullies
He ceased to weep
He became suddenly rapid and explanatory
Its not a fair game George
They tire you out
And Im not well
My stomachs all wrong
And I been and got a cold
I always been lible to cold and this ones on my chest
And then they tell you to speak up
They bait youand bait you and bait you
Its torture
The strain of it
You cant remember what you said
Youre bound to contradict yourself
Its like Russia George
It isnt fair play
Prominent man
Ive been next at dinners with that chap Neal Ive told him storiesand hes bitter
Sets out to ruin me
Dont ask a civil questionbellows
He broke down again
Ive been bellowed at I been bullied I been treated like a dog
Dirty cads they are
Dirty cads
Id rather be a ThreeCard Sharper than a barrister Id rather sell catsmeat in the streets
They sprung things on me this morning things I didnt expect
They rushed me
Id got it all in my hands and then I was jumped
By Neal
Neal Ive given city tips to
Neal
Ive helped Neal I couldnt swallow a mouthfulnot in the lunch hour
I couldnt face it
Its true GeorgeI couldnt face it
I said Id get a bit of air and slipped out and down to the Embankment and there I took a boat to Richmond
Some idee
I took a rowing boat when I got there and I rowed about on the river for a bit
A lot of chaps and girls there was on the bank laughed at my shirtsleeves and top hat
Dessay they thought it was a pleasure trip
Fat lot of pleasure
I rowed round for a bit and came in
Then I came on here
Windsor way
And there they are in London doing what they like with me
I dont care
But I said looking down at him perplexed
Its abscondin
Theyll have a warrant
I dont understand I said
Its all up Georgeall up and over
And I thought Id live in that place George and die a lord
Its a great place reely an imperialif anyone has the sense to buy it and finish it
That terrace I stood thinking him over
Look here
I said
Whats that abouta warrant
Are you sure theyll get a warrant
Im sorry uncle but what have you done
Havent I told you
Yes but they wont do very much to you for that
Theyll only bring you up for the rest of your examination
He remained silent for a time
At last he spokespeaking with difficulty
Its worse than that
Ive done something
Theyre bound to get it out
Practically they HAVE got it out
What
Writin things downI done something
For the first time in his life I believe he felt and looked ashamed
It filled me with remorse to see him suffer so
Weve all done things I said
Its part of the game the world makes us play
If they want to arrest youand youve got no cards in your hand
They mustnt arrest you
No
Thats partly why I went to Richmond
But I never thought His little bloodshot eyes stared at Crest Hill
That chap Wittaker Wright he said he had his stuff ready
I havent
Now you got it George
Thats the sort of hole Im in
IV That memory of my uncle at the gate is very clear and full
I am able to recall even the undertow of my thoughts while he was speaking
I remember my pity and affection for him in his misery growing and stirring within me my realisation that at any risk I must help him
But then comes indistinctness again
I was beginning to act
I know I persuaded him to put himself in my hands and began at once to plan and do
I think that when we act most we remember least that just in the measure that the impulse of our impressions translates itself into schemes and movements it ceases to record itself in memories
I know I resolved to get him away at once and to use the Lord Roberts B in effecting that
It was clear he was soon to be a hunted man and it seemed to me already unsafe for him to try the ordinary Continental routes in his flight
I had to evolve some scheme and evolve it rapidly how we might drop most inconspicuously into the world across the water
My resolve to have one flight at least in my airship fitted with this like hand to glove
It seemed to me we might be able to cross over the water in the night set our airship adrift and turn up as pedestrian tourists in Normandy or Brittany and so get away
That at any rate was my ruling idea
I sent off Cothope with a dummy note to Woking because I did not want to implicate him and took my uncle to the pavilion
I went down to my aunt and made a clean breast of the situation
She became admirably competent
We went into his dressingroom and ruthlessly broke his locks
I got a pair of brown boots a tweed suit and a cap of his and indeed a plausible walking outfit and a little game bag for his pedestrian gear and in addition a big motoring overcoat and a supply of rugs to add to those I had at the pavilion
I also got a flask of brandy and she made sandwiches
I dont remember any servants appearing and I forget where she got those sandwiches
Meanwhile we talked
Afterwards I thought with what a sure confidence we talked to each other Whats he done
she said
Dyou mind knowing
No conscience left thank God
I thinkforgery
There was just a little pause
Can you carry this bundle
she asked
I lifted it
No woman ever has respected the lawever she said
Its too silly
The things it lets you do
And then pulls you uplike a mad nurse minding a child
She carried some rugs for me through the shrubbery in the darkling
Theyll think were going mooning she said jerking her head at the household
I wonder what they make of uscriminals
 An immense droning note came as if in answer to that
It startled us both for a moment
The dears
she said
Its the gong for dinner
But I wish I could help little Teddy George
Its awful to think of him there with hot eyes red and dry
And I knowthe sight of me makes him feel sore
Things I said George
If I could have seen Id have let him have an omnibusful of Scrymgeours
I cut him up
Hed never thought I meant it before
Ill help all I can anyhow
I turned at something in her voice and got a moon light gleam of tears upon her face
Could SHE have helped
she asked abruptly
SHE
That woman
My God
I cried HELPED
Thosethings dont help
Tell me again what I ought to do she said after a silence
I went over the plans I had made for communicating and the things I thought she might do
I had given her the address of a solicitor she might put some trust in
But you must act for yourself I insisted
Roughly I said its a scramble
You must get what you can for us and follow as you can
She nodded
She came right up to the pavilion and hovered for a time shyly and then went away
I found my uncle in my sittingroom in an armchair with his feet upon the fender of the gas stove which he had lit and now he was feebly drunken with my whisky and very weary in body and spirit and inclined to be cowardly
I lef my drops he said
He changed his clothes slowly and unwillingly
I had to bully him I had almost to shove him to the airship and tuck him up upon its wicker flat
Singlehanded I made but a clumsy start we scraped along the roof of the shed and bent a van of the propeller and for a time I hung underneath without his offering a hand to help me to clamber up
If it hadnt been for a sort of anchoring trolley device of Cothopes a sort of slip anchor running on a rail we should never have got clear at all
V The incidents of our flight in Lord Roberts B do not arrange themselves in any consecutive order
To think of that adventure is like dipping haphazard into an album of views
One is reminded first of this and then of that
We were both lying down on a horizontal plate of basketwork for Lord Roberts B had none of the elegant accommodation of a balloon
I lay forward and my uncle behind me in such a position that he could see hardly anything of our flight
We were protected from rolling over simply by netting between the steel stays
It was impossible for us to stand up at all we had either to lie or crawl on all fours over the basket work
Amidships were lockers made of Watsons Aulite materialand between these it was that I had put my uncle wrapped in rugs
I wore sealskin motoring boots and gloves and a motoring fur coat over my tweeds and I controlled the engine by Bowden wires and levers forward
The early part of that nights experience was made up of warmth of moonlit Surrey and Sussex landscape and of a rapid and successful flight ascending and swooping and then ascending again southward
I could not watch the clouds because the airship overhung me I could not see the stars nor gauge the meteorological happening but it was fairly clear to me that a wind shifting between north and northeast was gathering strength and after I had satisfied myself by a series of entirely successful expansions and contractions of the real airworthiness of Lord Roberts B I stopped the engine to save my petrol and let the monster drift checking its progress by the dim landscape below
My uncle lay quite still behind me saying little and staring in front of him and I was left to my own thoughts and sensations
My thoughts whatever they were have long since faded out of memory and my sensations have merged into one continuous memory of an countryside lying as it seemed under snow with square patches of dimness white phantoms of roads rents and pools of velvety blackness and lampjewelled houses
I remember a train boring its way like a hastening caterpillar of fire across the landscape and how distinctly I heard its clatter
Every town and street was buttoned with street lamps
I came quite close to the South Downs near Lewes and all the lights were out in the houses and the people gone to bed
We left the land a little to the east of Brighton and by that time Brighton was well abed
and the brightly lit seafront deserted
Then I let out the gas chamber to its fullest extent and rose
I like to be high above water
I do not clearly know what happened in the night
I think I must have dozed and probably my uncle slept
I remember that once or twice I heard him talking in an eager muffled voice to himself or to an imaginary court
But there can be no doubt the wind changed right round into the east and that we were carried far down the Channel without any suspicion of the immense leeway we were making
I remember the kind of stupid perplexity with which I saw the dawn breaking over a grey waste of water below and realised that something was wrong
I was so stupid that it was only after the sunrise I really noticed the trend of the foam caps below and perceived we were in a severe easterly gale
Even then instead of heading southeasterly I set the engine going headed south and so continued a course that must needs have either just hit Ushant or carry us over the Bay of Biscay
I thought I was east of Cherbourg when I was far to the west and stopped my engine in that belief and then set it going again
I did actually sight the coast of Brittany to the southeast in the late afternoon and that it was woke me up to the gravity of our position
I discovered it by accident in the southeast when I was looking for it in the southwest
I turned about east and faced the wind for some time and finding I had no chance in its teeth went high where it seemed less violent and tried to make a course southeast
It was only then that I realised what a gale I was in
I had been going westward and perhaps even in gusts north of west at a pace of fifty or sixty miles an hour
Then I began what I suppose would be called a Fight against the east wind
One calls it a Fight but it was really almost as unlike a fight as plain sewing
The wind tried to drive me westwardly and I tried to get as much as I could eastwardly with the wind beating and rocking us irregularly but by no means unbearably for about twelve hours
My hope lay in the wind abating and our keeping in the air and eastward of Finisterre until it did and the chief danger was the exhaustion of our petrol
It was a long and anxious and almost meditative time we were fairly warm and only slowly getting hungry and except that my uncle grumbled a little and produced some philosophical reflections and began to fuss about having a temperature we talked very little
I was tired and sulky and chiefly worried about the engine
I had to resist a tendency to crawl back and look at it
I did not care to risk contracting our gas chamber for fear of losing gas
Nothing was less like a fight
I know that in popular magazines and so forth all such occasions as this are depicted in terms of hysteria
Captains save their ships engineers complete their bridges generals conduct their battles in a state of dancing excitement foaming recondite technicalities at the lips
I suppose that sort of thing works up the reader but so far as it professes to represent reality I am convinced it is all childish nonsense
schoolboys of fifteen girls of eighteen and literary men all their lives may have these squealing fits but my own experience is that most exciting scenes are not exciting and most of the urgent moments in life are met by steadyheaded men
Neither I nor my uncle spent the night in ejaculations nor in humorous allusions nor any of these things
We remained lumpish
My uncle stuck in his place and grumbled about his stomach and occasionally rambled off into expositions of his financial position and denunciations of Nealhe certainly struck out one or two good phrases for Nealand I crawled about at rare intervals in a vague sort of way and grunted and our basketwork creaked continually and the wind on our quarter made a sort of ruffled flapping in the wall of the gas chamber
For all our wraps we got frightfully cold as the night wore on
I must have dozed and it was still dark when I realised with a start that we were nearly due south of and a long way from a regularlyflashing lighthouse standing out before the glow of some great town and then that the thing that had awakened me was the cessation of our engine and that we were driving back to the west
Then indeed for a time I felt the grim thrill of life
I crawled forward to the cords of the release valves made my uncle crawl forward too and let out the gas until we were falling down through the air like a clumsy glider towards the vague greyness that was land
Something must have intervened here that I have forgotten
I saw the lights of Bordeaux when it was quite dark a nebulous haze against black of that I am reasonably sure
But certainly our fall took place in the cold uncertain light of early dawn
I am at least equally sure of that
And Mimizan near where we dropped is fifty miles from Bordeaux whose harbour lights I must have seen
I remember coming down at last with a curious indifference and actually rousing myself to steer
But the actual coming to earth was exciting enough
I remember our prolonged dragging landfall and the difficulty I had to get clear and how a gust of wind caught Lord Roberts B as my uncle stumbled away from the ropes and litter and dropped me heavily and threw me on to my knees
Then came the realisation that the monster was almost consciously disentangling itself for escape and then the light leap of its rebound
The rope slipped out of reach of my hand
I remember running kneedeep in a salt pool in hopeless pursuit of the airship
As it dragged and rose seaward and how only after it had escaped my uttermost effort to recapture it did I realise that this was quite the best thing that could have happened
It drove swiftly over the sandy dunes lifting and falling and was hidden by a clump of windbitten trees
Then it reappeared much further off and still receding
It soared for a time and sank slowly and after that I saw it no more
I suppose it fell into the sea and got wetted with salt water and heavy and so became deflated and sank
It was never found and there was never a report of anyone seeing it after it escaped from me
VI But if I find it hard to tell the story of our long flight through the air overseas at least that dawn in France stands cold and clear and full
I see again almost as if I saw once more with my bodily eyes the ridges of sand rising behind ridges of sand grey and cold and blackbrowed with an insufficient grass
I feel again the clear cold chill of dawn and hear the distant barking of a dog
I find myself asking again What shall we do now
and trying to scheme with brain tired beyond measure
At first my uncle occupied my attention
He was shivering a good deal and it was all I could do to resist my desire to get him into a comfortable bed at once
But I wanted to appear plausibly in this part of the world
I felt it would not do to turn up anywhere at dawn and rest it would be altogether too conspicuous we must rest until the day was well advanced and then appear as roadstained pedestrians seeking a meal
I gave him most of what was left of the biscuits emptied our flasks and advised him to sleep but at first it was too cold albeit I wrapped the big fur rug around him
I was struck now by the flushed weariness of his face and the look of age the grey stubble on his unshaved chin gave him
He sat crumpled up shivering and coughing munching reluctantly but drinking eagerly and whimpering a little a dreadfully pitiful figure to me
But we had to go through with it there was no way out for us
Presently the sun rose over the pines and the sand grew rapidly warm
My uncle had done eating and sat with his wrists resting on his knees the most hopeless looking of lost souls
Im ill he said Im damnably ill
I can feel it in my skin
Thenit was horrible to mehe cried I ought to be in bed I ought to be in bed instead of flying about and suddenly he burst into tears
I stood up
Go to sleep man
I said and took the rug from him and spread it out and rolled him up in it
Its all very well he protested Im not young enough Lift up your head I interrupted and put his knapsack under it
Theyll catch us here just as much as in an inn he grumbled and then lay still
Presently after a long time I perceived he was asleep
His breath came with peculiar wheezings and every now and again he would cough
I was very stiff and tired myself and perhaps I dozed
I dont remember
I remember only sitting as it seemed nigh interminably beside him too weary even to think in that sandy desolation
No one came near us no creature not even a dog
I roused myself at last feeling that it was vain to seek to seem other than abnormal and with an effort that was like lifting a sky of lead we made our way through the wearisome sand to a farmhouse
There I feigned even a more insufficient French than I possess naturally and let it appear that we were pedestrians from Biarritz who had lost our way along the shore and got benighted
This explained us pretty well I thought and we got most heartening coffee and a cart to a little roadside station
My uncle grew more and more manifestly ill with every stage of our journey
I got him to Bayonne where he refused at first to eat and was afterwards very sick and then took him shivering and collapsed up a little branch line to a frontier place called Luzon Gare
We found one homely inn with two small bedrooms kept by a kindly Basque woman
I got him to bed and that night shared his room and after an hour or so of sleep he woke up in a raging fever and with a wandering mind cursing Neal and repeating long inaccurate lists of figures
He was manifestly a case for a doctor and in the morning we got one in
He was a young man from Montpelier just beginning to practise and very mysterious and technical and modern and unhelpful
He spoke of cold and exposure and la grippe and pneumonia
He gave many explicit and difficult directions
I perceived it devolved upon me to organise nursing and a sickroom
I installed a religieuse in the second bedroom of the inn and took a room for myself in the inn of Port de Luzon a quarter of a mile away
VII And now my story converges on what in that queer corner of refuge out of the world was destined to be my uncles deathbed
There is a background of the Pyrenees of blue hills and sunlit houses of the old castle of Luzon and a noisy cascading river and for a foreground the dim stuffy room whose windows both the religieuse and hostess conspired to shut with its waxed floor its fourposter bed its characteristically French chairs and fireplace its champagne bottles and dirty basins and used towels and packets of Somatose on the table
And in the sickly air of the confined space in behind the curtains of the bed lay my little uncle with an effect of being enthroned and secluded or sat up or writhed and tossed in his last dealings of life
One went and drew back the edge of the curtains if one wanted to speak to him or look at him
Usually he was propped up against pillows because so he breathed more easily
He slept hardly at all
I have a confused memory of vigils and mornings and afternoons spent by that bedside and how the religieuse hovered about me and how meek and good and inefficient she was and how horribly black were her nails
Other figures come and go and particularly the doctor a young man plumply rococo in bicycling dress with fine waxen features a little pointed beard and the long black frizzy hair and huge tie of a minor poet
Bright and clearcut and irrelevant are memories of the Basque hostess of my uncles inn and of the family of Spanish people who entertained me and prepared the most amazingly elaborate meals for me with soup and salad and chicken and remarkable sweets
They were all very kind and sympathetic people systematically so
And constantly without attracting attention I was trying to get newspapers from home
My uncle is central to all these impressions
I have tried to make you picture him time after time as the young man of the Wimblehurst chemists shop as the shabby assistant in Tottenham Court Road as the adventurer of the early days of TonoBungay as the confident preposterous plutocrat
And now I have to tell of him strangely changed under the shadow of oncoming death with his skin lax and yellow and glistening with sweat his eyes large and glassy his countenance unfamiliar through the growth of a beard his nose pinched and thin
Never had he looked so small as now
And he talked to me in a whispering strained voice of great issues of why his life had been and whither he was going
Poor little man
that last phase is as it were disconnected from all the other phases
It was as if he crawled out from the ruins of his career and looked about him before he died
For he had quite clearminded states in the intervals of his delirium
He knew he was almost certainly dying
In a way that took the burthen of his cares off his mind
There was no more Neal to face no more flights or evasions no punishments
It has been a great career George he said but I shall be glad to rest
Glad to rest
Glad to rest
His mind ran rather upon his career and usually I am glad to recall with a note of satisfaction and approval
In his delirious phases he would most often exaggerate this selfsatisfaction and talk of his splendours
He would pluck at the sheet and stare before him and whisper halfaudible fragments of sentences
What is this great place these cloudcapped towers these any pinnacles
Ilion
Skypointing Ilion House the residence of one of our great merchant princes Terrace above terrace
Reaching to the heavens Kingdoms Caesar never knew A great poet George
Zzzz
Kingdoms Caesar never knew
Under entirely new management
GreatnessMillions
Universities
He stands on the terraceon the upper terracedirectingdirectingby the globedirectingthe trade
It was hard at times to tell when his sane talk ceased and his delirium began
The secret springs of his life the vain imaginations were revealed
I sometimes think that all the life of man sprawls abed careless and unkempt until it must needs clothe and wash itself and come forth seemly in act and speech for the encounter with ones fellowmen
I suspect that all things unspoken in our souls partake somewhat of the laxity of delirium and dementia
Certainly from those slimy tormented lips above the bristling grey beard came nothing but dreams and disconnected fancies
Sometimes he raved about Neal threatened Neal
What has he got invested
he said
Does he think he can escape me
If I followed him up
Ruin
Ruin One would think I had taken his money
And sometimes he reverted to our airship flight
Its too long George too long and too cold
Im too old a mantoo oldfor this sort of thing You know youre not savingyoure killing me
Towards the end it became evident our identity was discovered
I found the press and especially Booms section of it had made a sort of hue and cry for us sent special commissioners to hunt for us and though none of these emissaries reached us until my uncle was dead one felt the forewash of that storm of energy
The thing got into the popular French press
People became curious in their manner towards us and a number of fresh faces appeared about the weak little struggle that went on in the closeness behind the curtains of the bed
The young doctor insisted on consultations and a motorcar came up from Biarritz and suddenly odd people with questioning eyes began to poke in with inquiries and help
Though nothing was said I could feel that we were no longer regarded as simple middleclass tourists about me as I went I perceived almost as though it trailed visibly the prestige of Finance and a criminal notoriety
Local personages of a plump and prosperous quality appeared in the inn making inquiries the Luzon priest became helpful people watched our window and stared at me as I went to and fro and then we had a raid from a little English clergyman and his amiable capable wife in severely Anglican blacks who swooped down upon us like virtuous but resolute vultures from the adjacent village of Saint Jean de Pollack
The clergyman was one of those odd types that oscillate between remote country towns in England and the conduct of English Church services on mutual terms in enterprising hotels abroad a tremulous obstinate little being with sporadic hairs upon his face spectacles a red button nose and aged black raiment
He was evidently enormously impressed by my uncles monetary greatness and by his own inkling of our identity and he shone and brimmed over with tact and fussy helpfulness
He was eager to share the watching of the bedside with me he proffered services with both hands and as I was now getting into touch with affairs in London again and trying to disentangle the gigantic details of the smash from the papers I had succeeded in getting from Biarritz I accepted his offers pretty generously and began the studies in modern finance that lay before me
I had got so out of touch with the old traditions of religion that I overlooked the manifest possibility of his attacking my poor sinking vestiges of an uncle with theological solicitudes
My attention was called to that however very speedily by a polite but urgent quarrel between himself and the Basque landlady as to the necessity of her hanging a cheap crucifix in the shadow over the bed where it might catch my uncles eye where indeed I found it had caught his eye
Good Lord
I cried is THAT still going on
That night the little clergyman watched and in the small hours he raised a false alarm that my uncle was dying and made an extraordinary fuss
He raised the house
I shall never forget that scene I think which began with a tapping at my bedroom door just after I had fallen asleep and his voice If you want to see your uncle before he goes you must come now
The stuffy little room was crowded when I reached it and lit by three flickering candles
I felt I was back in the eighteenth century
There lay my poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled bedclothes weary of life beyond measure weary and rambling and the little clergyman trying to hold his hand and his attention and repeating over and over again Mr Ponderevo Mr Ponderevo it is all right
It is all right
Only Believe
Believe on me and ye shall be saved
Close at hand was the doctor with one of those cruel and idiotic injection needles modern science puts in the hands of these halfeducated young men keeping my uncle flickeringly alive for no reason whatever
The religieuse hovered sleepily in the background with an overdue and neglected dose
In addition the landlady had not only got up herself but roused an aged crone of a mother and a partially imbecile husband and there was also a fattish stolid man in grey alpaca with an air of importancewho he was and how he got there I dont know
I rather fancy the doctor explained him to me in French I did not understand
And they were all there wearily nocturnal hastily and carelessly dressed intent upon the life that flickered and sank making a public and curious show of its going queer shapes of human beings lit by three uncertain candles and every soul of them keenly and avidly resolved to be in at the death
The doctor stood the others were all sitting on chairs the landlady had brought in and arranged for them
And my uncle spoilt the climax and did not die
I replaced the little clergyman on the chair by the bedside and he hovered about the room
I think he whispered to me mysteriously as he gave place to me I believeit is well with him
I heard him trying to render the stock phrases of Low Church piety into French for the benefit of the stolid man in grey alpaca
Then he knocked a glass off the table and scrabbled for the fragments
From the first I doubted the theory of an immediate death
I consulted the doctor in urgent whispers
I turned round to get champagne and nearly fell over the clergymans legs
He was on his knees at the additional chair the Basque landlady had got on my arrival and he was praying aloud Oh Heavenly Father have mercy on this thy Child I hustled him up and out of the way and in another minute he was down at another chair praying again and barring the path of the religieuse who had found me the corkscrew
Something put into my head that tremendous blasphemy of Carlyles about the last mew of a drowning kitten
He found a third chair vacant presently it was as if he was playing a game
Good Heavens
I said we must clear these people out and with a certain urgency I did
I had a temporary lapse of memory and forgot all my French
I drove them out mainly by gesture and opened the window to the universal horror
I intimated the death scene was postponed and as a matter of fact my uncle did not die until the next night
I did not let the little clergyman come near him again and I was watchful for any sign that his mind had been troubled
But he made none
He talked once about that parson chap
Didnt bother you
I asked
Wanted something he said
I kept silence listening keenly to his mutterings
I understood him to say They wanted too much
His face puckered like a childs going to cry
You cant get a safe six per cent he said
I had for a moment a wild suspicion that those urgent talks had not been altogether spiritual but that I think was a quite unworthy and unjust suspicion
The little clergyman was as simple and honest as the day
My uncle was simply generalising about his class
But it may have been these talks that set loose some long dormant string of ideas in my uncles brain ideas the things of this world had long suppressed and hidden altogether
Near the end he suddenly became clearminded and lucid albeit very weak and his voice was little but clear
George he said
Im here I said close beside you
George
You have always been responsible for the science
George
You know better than I do
IsIs it proved
What proved
Either way
I dont understand
Death ends all
After so muchSuch splendid beginnins
Somewhere
Something
I stared at him amazed
His sunken eyes were very grave
What do you expect
I said in wonder
He would not answer
Aspirations he whispered
He fell into a broken monologue regardless of me
Trailing clouds of glory he said and firstrate poet firstrateGeorge was always hard
Always
For a long time there was silence
Then he made a gesture that he wished to speak
Seems to me George I bent my head down and he tried to lift his hand to my shoulder
I raised him a little on his pillows and listened
It seems to me George alwaysthere must be something in methat wont die
He looked at me as though the decision rested with me
I think he said something
Then for a moment his mind wandered
Just a little link he whispered almost pleadingly and lay quite still but presently he was uneasy again
Some other world Perhaps I said
Who knows
Some other world
Not the same scope for enterprise I said
No
He became silent
I sat leaning down to him and following out my own thoughts and presently the religieuse resumed her periodic conflict with the window fastening
For a time he struggled for breath
It seemed such nonsense that he should have to suffer sopoor silly little man
George he whispered and his weak little hand came out
PERHAPS He said no more but I perceived from the expression of his eyes that he thought the question had been put
Yes I think so I said stoutly
Arent you sure
Ohpractically sure said I and I think he tried to squeeze my hand
And there I sat holding his hand tight and trying to think what seeds of immortality could be found in all his being what sort of ghost there was in him to wander out into the bleak immensities
Queer fancies came to me
He lay still for a long time save for a brief struggle or so for breath and ever and again I wiped his mouth and lips
I fell into a pit of thought
I did not remark at first the change that was creeping over his face
He lay back on his pillow made a faint zzzing sound that ceased and presently and quite quietly he diedgreatly comforted by my assurance
I do not know when he died
His hand relaxed insensibly
Suddenly with a start with a shock I found that his mouth had fallen open and that he was dead VIII It was dark night when I left his deathbed and went back to my own inn down the straggling street of Luzon
That return to my inn sticks in my memory also as a thing apart as an experience apart
Within was a subdued bustle of women a flitting of lights and the doing of petty offices to that queer exhausted thing that had once been my active and urgent little uncle
For me those offices were irksome and impertinent
I slammed the door and went out into the warm foggy drizzle of the village street lit by blurred specks of light in great voids of darkness and never a soul abroad
That warm veil of fog produced an effect of vast seclusion
The very houses by the roadside peered through it as if from another world
The stillness of the night was marked by an occasional remote baying of dogs all these people kept dogs because of the near neighbourhood of the frontier
Death
It was one of those rare seasons of relief when for a little time one walks a little outside of and beside life
I felt as I sometimes feel after the end of a play
I saw the whole business of my uncles life as something familiar and completed
It was done like a play one leaves like a book one closes
I thought of the push and the promotions the noise of London the crowded various company of people through which our lives had gone the public meetings the excitements the dinners and disputations and suddenly it appeared to me that none of these things existed
It came to me like a discovery that none of these things existed
Before and after I have thought and called life a phantasmagoria but never have I felt its truth as I did that night We had parted we two who had kept company so long had parted
But there was I knew no end to him or me
He had died a dream death and ended a dream his pain dream was over
It seemed to me almost as though I had died too
What did it matter since it was unreality all of it the pain and desire the beginning and the end
There was no reality except this solitary road this quite solitary road along which one went rather puzzled rather tired Part of the fog became a big mastiff that came towards me and stopped and slunk round me growling barked gruffly and shortly and presently became fog again
My mind swayed back to the ancient beliefs and fears of our race
My doubts and disbeliefs slipped from me like a loosely fitting garment
I wondered quite simply what dogs bayed about the path of that other walker in the darkness what shapes what lights it might be loomed about him as he went his way from our last encounter on earthalong the paths that are real and the way that endures for ever
IX Last belated figure in that grouping round my uncles deathbed is my aunt
When it was beyond all hope that my uncle could live I threw aside whatever concealment remained to us and telegraphed directly to her
But she came too late to see him living
She saw him calm and still strangely unlike his habitual garrulous animation an unfamiliar inflexibility
It isnt like him she whispered awed by this alien dignity
I remember her chiefly as she talked and wept upon the bridge below the old castle
We had got rid of some amateurish reporters from Biarritz and had walked together in the hot morning sunshine down through Port Luzon
There for a time we stood leaning on the parapet of the bridge and surveying the distant peeks the rich blue masses of the Pyrenees
For a long time we said nothing and then she began talking
Lifes a rum Go George
she began
Who would have thought when I used to darn your stockings at old Wimblehurst that this would be the end of the story
It seems far away nowthat little shop his and my first home
The glow of the bottles the big coloured bottles
Do you remember how the light shone on the mahogany drawers
The little gilt letters
Ol Amjig and Snap
I can remember it allbright and shininglike a Dutch picture
Real
And yesterday
And here we are in a dream
You a manand me an old woman George
And poor little Teddy who used to rush about and talkmaking that noise he didOh
She choked and the tears flowed unrestrained
She wept and I was glad to see her weeping
She stood leaning over the bridge her tearwet handkerchief gripped in her clenched hand
Just an hour in the old shop againand him talking
Before things got done
Before they got hold of him
And fooled him
Men oughtnt to be so tempted with business and things They didnt hurt him George
she asked suddenly
For a moment I was puzzled
Here I mean she said
No I lied stoutly suppressing the memory of that foolish injection needle I had caught the young doctor using
I wonder George if theyll let him talk in Heaven She faced me
Oh
George dear my heart aches and I dont know what I say and do
Give me your arm to lean onits good to have you dear and lean upon you
Yes I know you care for me
Thats why Im talking
Weve always loved one another and never said anything about it and you understand and I understand
But my hearts torn to pieces by this torn to rags and things drop out Ive kept in it
Its true he wasnt a husband much for me at the last
But he was my child George he was my child and all my children my silly child and life has knocked him about for me and Ive never had a say in the matter never a say its puffed him up and smashed himlike an old bagunder my eyes
I was clever enough to see it and not clever enough to prevent it and all I could do was to jeer
Ive had to make what I could of it
Like most people
Like most of us
But it wasnt fair George
It wasnt fair
Life and Deathgreat serious thingswhy couldnt they leave him alone and his lies and ways
If WE could see the lightness of it Why couldnt they leave him alone
she repeated in a whisper as we went towards the inn
CHAPTER THE SECOND LOVE AMONG THE WRECKAGE I When I came back I found that my share in the escape and death of my uncle had made me for a time a notorious and even popular character
For two weeks I was kept in London facing the music as he would have said and making things easy for my aunt and I still marvel at the consideration with which the world treated me
For now it was open and manifest that I and my uncle were no more than specimens of a modern species of brigand wasting the savings of the public out of the sheer wantonness of enterprise
I think that in a way his death produced a reaction in my favour and my flight of which some particulars now appeared stuck in the popular imagination
It seemed a more daring and difficult feat than it was and I couldnt very well write to the papers to sustain my private estimate
There can be little doubt that men infinitely prefer the appearance of dash and enterprise to simple honesty
No one believed I was not an arch plotter in his financing
Yet they favoured me
I even got permission from the trustee to occupy my chalet for a fortnight while I cleared up the mass of papers calculations notes of work drawings and the like that I left in disorder when I started on that impulsive raid upon the Mordet quap heaps
I was there alone
I got work for Cothope with the Ilchesters for whom I now build these destroyers
They wanted him at once and he was short of money so I let him go and managed very philosophically by myself
But I found it hard to fix my attention on aeronautics I had been away from the work for a full halfyear and more a halfyear crowded with intense disconcerting things
For a time my brain refused these fine problems of balance and adjustment altogether it wanted to think about my uncles dropping jaw my aunts reluctant tears about dead negroes and pestilential swamps about the evident realities of cruelty and pain about life and death
Moreover it was weary with the frightful pile of figures and documents at the Hardingham a task to which this raid to Lady Grove was simply an interlude
And there was Beatrice
On the second morning as I sat out upon the veranda recalling memories and striving in vain to attend to some too succinct pencil notes of Cothopes Beatrice rode up suddenly from behind the pavilion and pulled rein and became still Beatrice a little flushed from riding and sitting on a big black horse
I did not instantly rise
I stared at her
YOU
I said
She looked at me steadily
Me she said I did not trouble about any civilities
I stood up and asked point blank a question that came into my head
Whose horse is that
I said
She looked me in the eyes
Carnabys she answered
How did you get herethis way
The walls down
Down
Already
A great bit of it between the plantations
And you rode through and got here by chance
I saw you yesterday
And I rode over to see you
I had now come close to her and stood looking up into her face
Im a mere vestige I said
She made no answer but remained regarding me steadfastly with a curious air of proprietorship
You know Im the living survivor now of the great smash
Im rolling and dropping down through all the scaffolding of the social system
Its all a chance whether I roll out free at the bottom or go down a crack into the darkness out of sight for a year or two
The sun she remarked irrelevantlyhas burnt you
Im getting down
She swung herself down into my arms and stood beside me face to face
Wheres Cothope
she asked
Gone
Her eyes flitted to the pavilion and back to me
We stood close together extraordinarily intimate and extraordinarily apart
Ive never seen this cottage of yours she said and I want to
She flung the bridle of her horse round the veranda post and I helped her tie it
Did you get what you went for to Africa
she asked
No I said I lost my ship
And that lost everything
Everything
She walked before me into the livingroom of the chalet and I saw that she gripped her ridingwhip very tightly in her hand
She looked about her for a momentand then at me
Its comfortable she remarked
Our eyes met in a conversation very different from the one upon our lips
A sombre glow surrounded us drew us together an unwonted shyness kept us apart
She roused herself after an instants pause to examine my furniture
You have chintz curtains
I thought men were too feckless to have curtains without a woman
But of course your aunt did that
And a couch and a brass fender andis that a pianola
That is your desk
I thought mens desks were always untidy and covered with dust and tobacco ash
She flitted to my colour prints and my little case of books
Then she went to the pianola
I watched her intently
Does this thing play
she said
What
I asked
Does this thing play
I roused myself from my preoccupation
Like a musical gorilla with fingers all of one length
And a sort of soul
Its all the world of music to me
What do you play
Beethoven when I want to clear up my head while Im working
He ishow one would always like to work
Sometimes Chopin and those others but Beethoven
Beethoven mainly
Yes
Silence again between us
She spoke with an effort
Play me something
She turned from me and explored the rack of music rolls became interested and took a piece the first part of the Kreutzer Sonata hesitated
No she said that
She gave me Brahms Second Concerto Op
58 and curled up on the sofa watching me as I set myself slowly to play I say he said when I had done thats fine
I didnt know those things could play like that
Im all astir She came and stood over me looking at me
Im going to have a concert she said abruptly and laughed uneasily and hovered at the pigeonholes
Nownow what shall I have
She chose more of Brahms
Then we came to the Kreutzer Sonata
It is queer how Tolstoy has loaded that with suggestions debauched it made it a scandalous and intimate symbol
When I had played the first part of that she came up to the pianola and hesitated over me
I sat stifflywaiting
Suddenly she seized my downcast head and kissed my hair
She caught at my face between her hands and kissed my lips
I put my arms about her and we kissed together
I sprang to my feet and clasped her
Beatrice
I said
Beatrice
My dear she whispered nearly breathless with her arms about me
Oh
my dear
II Love like everything else in this immense process of social disorganisation in which we live is a thing adrift a fruitless thing broken away from its connexions
I tell of this love affair here because of its irrelevance because it is so remarkable that it should mean nothing and be nothing except itself
It glows in my memory like some bright casual flower starting up amidst the debris of a catastrophe
For nearly a fortnight we two met and made love together
Once more this mighty passion that our aimless civilisation has fettered and maimed and sterilised and debased gripped me and filled me with passionate delights and solemn joysthat were all you know futile and purposeless
Once more I had the persuasion This matters
Nothing else matters so much as this
We were both infinitely grave in such happiness as we had
I do not remember any laughter at all between us
Twelve days it lasted from that encounter in my chalet until our parting
Except at the end they were days of supreme summer and there was a waxing moon
We met recklessly day by day
We were so intent upon each other at first so intent upon expressing ourselves to each other and getting at each other that we troubled very little about the appearance of our relationship
We met almost openly We talked of ten thousand things and of ourselves
We loved
We made love
There is no prose of mine that can tell of hours transfigured
The facts are nothing
Everything we touched the meanest things became glorious
How can I render bare tenderness and delight and mutual possession
I sit here at my desk thinking of untellable things
I have come to know so much of love that I know now what love might be
We loved scarred and stained we partedbasely and inevitably but at least I met love
I remember as we sat in a Canadian canoe in a reedy bushmasked shallow we had discovered operating out of that pineshaded Woking canal how she fell talking of the things that happened to her before she met me again She told me things and they so joined and welded together other things that lay disconnected in my memory that it seemed to me I had always known what she told me
And yet indeed I had not known nor suspected it save perhaps for a luminous transitory suspicion ever and again
She made me see how life had shaped her
She told me of her girlhood after I had known her
We were poor and pretending and managing
We hacked about on visits and things
I ought to have married
The chances I had werent particularly good chances
I didnt like em
She paused
Then Carnaby came along
I remained quite still
She spoke now with downcast eyes and one finger just touching the water
One gets bored bored beyond redemption
One does about to these huge expensive houses I supposethe scales immense
One makes ones self useful to the other women and agreeable to the men
One has to dress One has food and exercise and leisure Its the leisure and the space and the blank opportunity it seems a sin not to fill
Carnaby isnt like the other men
Hes bigger
They go about making love
Everybodys making love
I did And I dont do things by halves
She stopped
You knew
she asked looking up quite steadily
I nodded
Since when
Those last days
It hasnt seemed to matter really
I was a little surprised She looked at me quietly
Cothope knew she said
By instinct
I could feel it
I suppose I began once this would have mattered immensely
Now Nothing matters she said completing me
I felt I had to tell you
I wanted you to understand why I didnt marry youwith both hands
I have loved youshe pausedhave loved you ever since the day I kissed you in the bracken
OnlyI forgot
And suddenly she dropped her face upon her hands and sobbed passionately I forgotI forgot she cried and became still
I dabbled my paddle in the water
Look here
I said forget again
Here am Ia ruined man
Marry me
She shook her head without looking up
We were still for a long time
Marry me
I whispered
She looked up twined back a whisp of hair and answered dispassionately I wish I could
Anyhow we have had this time
It has been a fine timehas it beenfor you also
I havent nudged you all I had to give
Its a poor giftexcept for what it means and might have been
But we are near the end of it now
Why
I asked
Marry me
Why should we two You think she said I could take courage and come to you and be your everyday wifewhile you work and are poor
Why not
said I
She looked at me gravely with extended finger
Do you really think thatof me
Havent you seen meall
I hesitated
Never once have I really meant marrying you she insisted
Never once
I fell in love with you from the first
But when you seemed a successful man I told myself I wouldnt
I was lovesick for you and you were so stupid I came near it then
But I knew I wasnt good enough
What could I have been to you
A woman with bad habits and bad associations a woman smirched
And what could I do for you or be to you
If I wasnt good enough to be a rich mans wife Im certainly not good enough to be a poor ones
Forgive me for talking sense to you now but I wanted to tell you this somehow
She stopped at my gesture
I sat up and the canoe rocked with my movement
I dont care I said
I want to marry you and make you my wife
No she said dont spoil things
That is impossible
Impossible
Think
I cant do my own hair
Do you mean you will get me a maid
Good God
I cried disconcerted beyond measure wont you learn to do your own hair for me
Do you mean to say you can love a man She flung out her hands at me
Dont spoil it she cried
I have given you all I have I have given you all I can
If I could do it if I was good enough to do it I would
But I am a woman spoilt and ruined dear and you are a ruined man
When we are making love were loversbut think of the gulf between us in habits and ways of thought in will and training when we are not making love
Think of itand dont think of it
Dont think of it yet
We have snatched some hours
We still may have some hours
She suddenly knelt forward toward me with a glowing darkness in her eyes
Who cares if it upsets
she cried
If you say another word I will kiss you
And go to the bottom clutching you
Im not afraid of that
Im not a bit afraid of that
Ill die with you
Choose a death and Ill die with youreadily
Do listen to me
I love you
I shall always love you
Its because I love you that I wont go down to become a dirty familiar thing with you amidst the grime
Ive given all I can
Ive had all I can Tell me and she crept nearer have I been like the dusk to you like the warm dusk
Is there magic still
Listen to the ripple of water from your paddle
Look at the warm evening light in the sky
Who cares if the canoe upsets
Come nearer to me
Oh my love
come near
So
She drew me to her and our lips met
III I asked her to marry me once again
It was our last morning together and we had met very early about sunrise knowing that we were to part
No sun shone that day
The sky was overcast the morning chilly and lit by a clear cold spiritless light
A heavy dampness in the air verged close on rain
When I think of that morning it has always the quality of greying ashes wet with rain
Beatrice too had changed
The spring had gone out of her movement it came to me for the first time that some day she might grow old
She had become one flesh with the rest of common humanity the softness had gone from her voice and manner the dusky magic of her presence had gone
I saw these things with perfect clearness and they made me sorry for them and for her
But they altered my love not a whit abated it nothing
And when we had talked awkwardly for half a dozen sentences I came dully to my point
And now I cried will you marry me
No she said I shall keep to my life here
I asked her to marry me in a years time
She shook her head
This world is a soft world I said in spite of my present disasters
I know now how to do things
If I had you to work forin a year I could be a prosperous man No she said I will put it brutally I shall go back to Carnaby
But
I did not feel angry
I had no sort of jealousy no wounded pride no sense of injury
I had only a sense of grey desolation of hopeless crosspurposes
Look here she said
I have been awake all night and every night
I have been thinking of thisevery moment when we have not been together
Im not answering you on an impulse
I love you
I love you
Ill say that over ten thousand times
But here we are The rest of life together I said
It wouldnt be together
Now we are together
Now we have been together
We are full of memories I do not feel I can ever forget a single one
Nor I
And I want to close it and leave it at that
You see dear what else is there to do
She turned her white face to me
All I know of love all I have ever dreamt or learnt of love I have packed into these days for you
You think we might live together and go on loving
No
For you I will have no vain repetitions
You have had the best and all of me
Would you have us after this meet again in London or Paris or somewhere scuffle to some wretched dressmakers meet in a cabinet particulier
No I said
I want you to marry me
I want you to play the game of life with me as an honest woman should
Come and live with me
Be my wife and squaw
Bear me children
I looked at her white drawn face and it seemed to me I might carry her yet
I spluttered for words
My God
Beatrice
I cried but this is cowardice and folly
Are you afraid of life
You of all people
What does it matter what has been or what we were
Here we are with the world before us
Start clean and new with me
Well fight it through
Im not such a simple lover that Ill not tell you plainly when you go wrong and fight our difference out with you
Its the one thing I want the one thing I needto have you and more of you and more
This lovemakingits lovemaking
Its just a part of us an incident She shook her head and stopped me abruptly
Its all she said
All
I protested
Im wiser than you
Wiser beyond words
She turned her eyes to me and they shone with tears
I wouldnt have you say anythingbut what youre saying she said
But its nonsense dear
You know its nonsense as you say it
I tried to keep up the heroic note but she would not listen to it
Its no good she cried almost petulantly
This little world has made us what we are
Dont you seedont you see what I am
I can make love
I can make love and be loved prettily
Dear dont blame me
I have given you all I have
If I had anything more
I have gone through it all over and over againthought it out
This morning my head aches my eyes ache
The light has gone out of me and I am a sick and tired woman
But Im talking wisdombitter wisdom
I couldnt be any sort of helper to you any sort of wife any sort of mother
Im spoilt
Im spoilt by this rich idle way of living until every habit is wrong every taste wrong
The world is wrong
People can be ruined by wealth just as much as by poverty
Do you think I wouldnt face life with you if I could if I wasnt absolutely certain I should be down and dragging in the first halfmile of the journey
Here I amdamned
Damned
But I wont damn you
You know what I am
You know
You are too clear and simple not to know the truth
You try to romance and hector but you know the truth
I am a little cadsold and done
Im
My dear you think Ive been misbehaving but all these days Ive been on my best behaviour You dont understand because youre a man
A woman when shes spoilt is SPOILT
Shes dirty in grain
Shes done
She walked on weeping
Youre a fool to want me she said
Youre a fool to want mefor my sake just as much as yours
Weve done all we can
Its just romancing She dashed the tears from her eyes and turned upon me
Dont you understand
she challenged
Dont you know
We faced one another in silence for a moment
Yes I said I know
For a long time we spoke never a word but walked on together slowly and sorrowfully reluctant to turn about towards our parting
When at last we did she broke silence again
Ive had you she said
Heaven and hell I said cant alter that
Ive wanted she went on
Ive talked to you in the nights and made up speeches
Now when I want to make them Im tonguetied
But to me its just as if the moments we have had lasted for ever
Moods and states come and go
Today my light is out To this day I cannot determine whether she said or whether I imagined she said chloral
Perhaps a halfconscious diagnosis flashed it on my brain
Perhaps I am the victim of some perverse imaginative freak of memory some hinted possibility that scratched and seared
There the word stands in my memory as if it were written in fire
We came to the door of Lady Ospreys garden at last and it was beginning to drizzle
She held out her hands and I took them
Yours she said in a weary unimpassioned voice all that I hadsuch as it was
Will you forget
Never I answered
Never a touch or a word of it
No
You will she said
We looked at one another in silence and her face full of fatigue and misery
What could I do
What was there to do
I wish I said and stopped
Goodbye
IV That should have been the last I saw of her but indeed I was destined to see her once again
Two days after I was at Lady Grove I forget altogether upon what errand and as I walked back to the station believing her to be gone away she came upon me and she was riding with Carnaby just as I had seen them first
The encounter jumped upon us unprepared
She rode by her eyes dark in her white face and scarcely noticed me
She winced and grew stiff at the sight of me and bowed her head
But Carnaby because he thought I was a broken and discomfited man saluted me with an easy friendliness and shouted some genial commonplace to me
They passed out of sight and left me by the roadside And then indeed I tasted the ultimate bitterness of life
For the first time I felt utter futility and was wrung by emotion that begot no action by shame and pity beyond words
I had parted from her dully and I had seen my uncle break and die with dry eyes and a steady mind but this chance sight of my lost Beatrice brought me to tears
My face was wrung and tears came pouring down my cheeks
All the magic she had for me had changed to wild sorrow
Oh God
I cried this is too much and turned my face after her and made appealing gestures to the beech trees and cursed at fate
I wanted to do preposterous things to pursue her to save her to turn life back so that she might begin again
I wonder what would have happened had I overtaken them in pursuit breathless with running uttering incoherent words weeping expostulatory
I came near to doing that
There was nothing in earth or heaven to respect my curses or weeping
In the midst of it a man who had been trimming the opposite hedge appeared and stared at me
Abruptly ridiculously I dissembled before him and went on and caught my train
But the pain I felt then I have felt a hundred times it is with me as I write
It haunts this book I see that is what haunts this book from end to end
CHAPTER THE THIRD NIGHT AND THE OPEN SEA I I have tried throughout all this story to tell things as they happened to me
In the beginningthe sheets are still here on the table grimy and dogseared and oldlookingI said I wanted to tell MYSELF and the world in which I found myself and I have done my best
But whether I have succeeded I cannot imagine
All this writing is grey now and dead and trite and unmeaning to me some of it I know by heart
I am the last person to judge it
As I turn over the big pile of manuscript before me certain things become clearer to me and particularly the immense inconsequences of my experiences
It is I see now that I have it all before me a story of activity and urgency and sterility
I have called it TonoBungay but I had far better have called it Waste
I have told of childless Marion of my childless aunt of Beatrice wasted and wasteful and futile
What hope is there for a people whose women become fruitless
I think of all the energy I have given to vain things
I think of my industrious scheming with my uncle of Crest Hills vast cessation of his resonant strenuous career
Ten thousand men have envied him and wished to live as he lived
It is all one spectacle of forces running to waste of people who use and do not replace the story of a country hectic with a wasting aimless fever of trade and moneymaking and pleasureseeking
And now I build destroyers
Other people may see this country in other terms this is how I have seen it
In some early chapter in this heap I compared all our present colour and abundance to October foliage before the frosts nip down the leaves
That I still feel was a good image
Perhaps I see wrongly
It may be I see decay all about me because I am in a sense decay
To others it may be a scene of achievement and construction radiant with hope
I too have a sort of hope but it is a remote hope a hope that finds no promise in this Empire or in any of the great things of our time
How they will look in history I do not know how time and chance will prove them I cannot guess that is how they have mirrored themselves on one contemporary mind
II Concurrently with writing the last chapter of this book I have been much engaged by the affairs of a new destroyer we have completed
It has been an oddly complementary alternation of occupations
Three weeks or so ago this novel had to be put aside in order that I might give all my time day and night to the fitting and finishing of the engines
Last Thursday X 2 for so we call her was done and I took her down the Thames and went out nearly to Texel for a trial of speed
It is curious how at times ones impressions will all fuse and run together into a sort of unity and become continuous with things that have hitherto been utterly alien and remote
That rush down the river became mysteriously connected with this book
As I passed down the Thames I seemed in a new and parallel manner to be passing all England in review
I saw it then as I had wanted my readers to see it
The thought came to me slowly as I picked my way through the Pool it stood out clear as I went dreaming into the night out upon the wide North Sea
It wasnt so much thinking at the time as a sort of photographic thought that came and grew clear
X2 went ripping through the dirty oily water as scissors rip through canvas and the front of my mind was all intent with getting her through under the bridges and in and out among the steamboats and barges and rowingboats and piers
I lived with my hands and eyes hard ahead
I thought nothing then of any appearances but obstacles but for all that the back of my mind took the photographic memory of it complete and vivid This it came to me is England
That is what I wanted to give in my book
This
We started in the late afternoon
We throbbed out of our yard above Hammersmith Bridge fussed about for a moment and headed down stream
We came at an easy rush down Craven Reach past Fulham and Hurlingham past the long stretches of muddy meadow And muddy suburb to Battersea and Chelsea round the cape of tidy frontage that is Grosvenor Road and under Vauxhall Bridge and Westminster opened before us
We cleared a string of coal barges and there on the left in the October sunshine stood the Parliament houses and the flag was flying and Parliament was sitting
I saw it at the time unseeingly afterwards it came into my mind as the centre of the whole broad panoramic effect of that afternoon
The stiff square lace of Victorian Gothic with its Dutch clock of a tower came upon me suddenly and stared and whirled past in a slow half pirouette and became still I know behind me as if watching me recede
Arent you going to respect me then
it seemed to say
Not I
There in that great pile of Victorian architecture the landlords and the lawyers the bishops the railway men and the magnates of commerce go to and froin their incurable tradition of commercialised Bladesovery of meretricious gentry and nobility sold for riches
I have been near enough to know
The Irish and the Labourmen run about among their feet making a fuss effecting little theyve got no better plans that I can see
Respect it indeed
Theres a certain paraphernalia of dignity but whom does it deceive
The King comes down in a gilt coach to open the show and wears long robes and a crown and theres a display of stout and slender legs in white stockings and stout and slender legs in black stockings and artful old gentlemen in ermine
I was reminded of one congested afternoon I had spent with my aunt amidst a cluster of agitated womens hats in the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords and how I saw the King going to open Parliament and the Duke of Devonshire looking like a gorgeous pedlar and terribly bored with the cap of maintenance on a tray before him hung by slings from his shoulder
A wonderful spectacle
It is quaint no doubt this Englandit is even dignified in placesand full of mellow associations
That does not alter the quality of the realities these robes conceal
The realities are greedy trade base profit seeking bold advertisement and kingship and chivalry spite of this wearing of treasured robes are as dead among it all as that crusader my uncle championed against the nettles outside the Duffield church
I have thought much of that bright afternoons panorama
To run down the Thames so is to run ones hand over the pages in the book of England from end to end
One begins in Craven Reach and it is as if one were in the heart of old England
Behind us are Kew and Hampton Court with their memories of Kings and Cardinals and one runs at first between Fulhams episcopal garden parties and Hurlinghams playground for the sporting instinct of our race
The whole effect is English
There is space there are old trees and all the best qualities of the homeland in that upper reach
Putney too looks Anglican on a dwindling scale
And then for a stretch the newer developments slop over one misses Bladesover and there come first squalid stretches of mean homes right and left and then the dingy industrialism of the south side and on the north bank the polite long front of nice houses artistic literary administrative peoples residences that stretches from Cheyne Walk nearly to Westminster and hides a wilderness of slums
What a long slow crescendo that is mile after mile with the houses crowding closelier the multiplying succession of church towers the architectural moments the successive bridges until you come out into the second movement of the piece with Lambeths old palace under your quarter and the houses of Parliament on your bow
Westminster Bridge is ahead of you then and through it you flash and in a moment the roundfaced clock tower cranes up to peer at you again and New Scotland Yard squares at you a fat beefeater of a policeman disguised miraculously as a Bastille
For a stretch you have the essential London you have Charing Cross railway station heart of the world and the Embankment on the north side with its new hotels overshadowing its Georgian and Victorian architecture and mud and great warehouses and factories chimneys shot towers advertisements on the south
The northward skyline grows more intricate and pleasing and more and more does one thank God for Wren
Somerset House is as picturesque as the civil war one is reminded again of the original England one feels in the fretted sky the quality of Restoration Lace
And then comes Astors strong box and the lawyers Inns
I had a passing memory of myself there how once I had trudged along the Embankment westward weighing my uncles offer of three hundred pounds a year Through that central essential London reach I drove and X2 bored her nose under the foam regardless of it all like a black hound going through reedson what trail even I who made her cannot tell
And in this reach too one first meets the seagulls and is reminded of the sea
Blackfriars one takesjust under these two bridges and just between them is the finest bridge moment in the worldand behold soaring up hanging in the sky over a rude tumult of warehouses over a jostling competition of traders irrelevantly beautiful and altogether remote Saint Pauls
Of course
one says Saint Pauls
It is the very figure of whatever fineness the old Anglican culture achieved detached a more dignified and chastened Saint Peters colder greyer but still ornate it has never been over thrown never disavowed only the tall warehouses and all the roar of traffic have forgotten it every one has forgotten it the steamships the barges go heedlessly by regardless of it intricacies of telephone wires and poles cut blackly into its thin mysteries and presently when in a moment the traffic permits you and you look round for it it has dissolved like a cloud into the grey blues of the London sky
And then the traditional and ostensible England falls from you altogether
The third movement begins the last great movement in the London symphony in which the trim scheme of the old order is altogether dwarfed and swallowed up
Comes London Bridge and the great warehouses tower up about you waving stupendous cranes the gulls circle and scream in your ears large ships lie among their lighters and one is in the port of the world
Again and again in this book I have written of England as a feudal scheme overtaken by fatty degeneration and stupendous accidents of hypertrophy
For the last time I must strike that note as the memory of the dear neat little sunlit ancient Tower of London lying away in a gap among the warehouses comes back to me that little accumulation of buildings so provincially pleasant and dignified overshadowed by the vulgarest most typical exploit of modern England the sham Gothic casings to the ironwork of the Tower Bridge
That Tower Bridge is the very balance and confirmation of Westminsters dull pinnacles and tower
That sham Gothic bridge in the very gates of our mother of change the Sea 
But after that one is in a world of accident and nature
For the third part of the panorama of London is beyond all law order and precedence it is the seaport and the sea
One goes down the widening reaches through a monstrous variety of shipping great steamers great sailingships trailing the flags of all the world a monstrous confusion of lighters witches conferences of brownsailed barges wallowing tugs a tumultuous crowding and jostling of cranes and spars and wharves and stores and assertive inscriptions
Huge vistas of dock open right and left of one and here and there beyond and amidst it all are church towers little patches of indescribably oldfashioned and wornout houses riverside pubs and the like vestiges of townships that were long since torn to fragments and submerged in these new growths
And amidst it all no plan appears no intention no comprehensive desire
That is the very key of it all
Each day one feels that the pressure of commerce and traffic grew grew insensibly monstrous and first this man made a wharf and that erected a crane and then this company set to work and then that and so they jostled together to make this unassimilable enormity of traffic
Through it we dodged and drove eager for the high seas
I remember how I laughed aloud at the glimpse of the name of a London County Council steamboat that ran across me
Caxton it was called and another was Pepys and another was Shakespeare
They seemed so wildly out of place splashing about in that confusion
One wanted to take them out and wipe them and put them back in some English gentlemans library
Everything was alive about them flash ing splashing and passing ships moving tugs panting hawsers taut barges going down with men toiling at the sweeps the water all aswirl with the wash of shipping scaling into millions of little wavelets curling and frothing under the whip of the unceasing wind
Past it all we drove
And at Greenwich to the south you know there stands a fine stone frontage where all the victories are recorded in a Painted Hall and beside it is the Ship where once upon a time those gentlemen of Westminster used to have an annual dinnerbefore the port of London got too much for them altogether
The old facade of the Hospital was just warming to the sunset as we went by and after that right and left the river opened the sense of the sea increased and prevailed reach after reach from Northfleet to the Nore
And out you come at last with the sun behind you into the eastern sea
You speed up and tear the oily water louder and faster siroo sirooswishsiroo and the hills of Kentover which I once fled from the Christian teachings of Nicodemus Frappfall away on the right hand and Essex on the left
They fall away and vanish into blue haze and the tall slow ships behind the tugs scarce moving ships and wallowing sturdy tugs are all wrought of wet gold as one goes frothing by
They stand out bound on strange missions of life and death to the killing of men in unfamiliar lands
And now behind us is blue mystery and the phantom flash of unseen lights and presently even these are gone and I and my destroyer tear out to the unknown across a great grey space
We tear into the great spaces of the future and the turbines fall to talking in unfamiliar tongues
Out to the open we go to windy freedom and trackless ways
Light after light goes down
England and the Kingdom Britain and the Empire the old prides and the old devotions glide abeam astern sink down upon the horizon passpass
The river passesLondon passes England passes III This is the note I have tried to emphasise the note that sounds clear in my mind when I think of anything beyond the purely personal aspects of my story
It is a note of crumbling and confusion of change and seemingly aimless swelling of a bubbling up and medley of futile loves and sorrows
But through the confusion sounds another note
Through the confusion something drives something that is at once human achievement and the most inhuman of all existing things
Something comes out of it How can I express the values of a thing at once so essential and so immaterial
It is something that calls upon such men as I with an irresistible appeal
I have figured it in my last section by the symbol of my destroyer stark and swift irrelevant to most human interests
Sometimes I call this reality Science sometimes I call it Truth
But it is something we draw by pain and effort ont of the heart of life that we disentangle and make clear
Other men serve it I know in art in literature in social invention and see it in a thousand different figures under a hundred names
I see it always as austerity as beauty
This thing we make clear is the heart of life
It is the one enduring thing
Men and nations epochs and civilisation pass each making its contribution I do not know what it is this something except that it is supreme
It is a something a quality an element one may find now in colours now in norms now in sounds now in thoughts
It emerges from life with each year one lives and feels and generation by generation and age by age but the how and why of it are all beyond the compass of my mind
Yet the full sense of it was with me all that night as I drove lonely above the rush and murmur of my engines out upon the weltering circle of the sea
Far out to the northeast there came the flicker of a squadron of warships waving white swords of light about the sky
I kept them hulldown and presently they were mere summer lightning over the watery edge of the globe
I fell into thought that was nearly formless into doubts and dreams that have no words and it seemed good to me to drive ahead and on and or through the windy starlight over the long black waves
IV It was morning and day before I returned with the four sick and starving journalists who had got permission to come with me up the shining river and past the old grey Tower
I recall the back views of those journalists very distinctly going with a certain damp weariness of movement along a side street away from the river
They were good men and bore me no malice and they served me up to the public in turgid degenerate Kiplingese as a modest button on the complacent stomach of the Empire
Though as a matter of fact X2 isnt intended for the empire or indeed for the hands of any European power
We offered it to our own people first but they would have nothing to do with me and I have long since ceased to trouble much about such questions
I have come to see myself from the outside my country from the outsidewithout illusions
We make and pass
We are all things that make and pass striving upon a hidden mission out to the open sea
