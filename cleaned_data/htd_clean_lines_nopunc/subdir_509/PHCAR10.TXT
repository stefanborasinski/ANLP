They were jolly cheap said whoever it was and I think it was Robert and suppose they didnt go off on the night
Those Prosser kids would have something to snigger about then
The ones I got are all right Jane said I know they are because the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money Im sure thribble isnt grammar Anthea said
Of course it isnt said Cyril one word cant be grammar all by itself so you neednt be so jolly clever
Anthea was rummaging in the cornerdrawers of her mind for a very disagreeable answer when she remembered what a wet day it was and how the boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the top of the tram which their mother had promised them as a reward for not having once forgotten for six whole days to wipe their boots on the mat when they came home from school
So Anthea only said Dont be so jolly clever yourself Squirrel
And the fireworks look all right and youll have the eightpence that your tram fares didnt cost today to buy something more with
You ought to get a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence
I daresay said Cyril coldly but its not YOUR eightpence anyhow But look here said Robert really now about the fireworks
We dont want to be disgraced before those kids next door
They think because they wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good
I wouldnt wear plush if it was ever sounless it was black to be beheaded in if I was Mary Queen of Scots said Anthea with scorn
Robert stuck steadily to his point
One great point about Robert is the steadiness with which he can stick
I think we ought to test them he said
You young duffer said Cyril fireworks are like postagestamps
You can only use them once
What do you suppose it means by Carters tested seeds in the advertisement
There was a blank silence
Then Cyril touched his forehead with his finger and shook his head
A little wrong here he said
I was always afraid of that with poor Robert
All that cleverness you know and being top in algebra so oftenits bound to tell Dry up said Robert fiercely
Dont you see
You cant TEST seeds if you do them ALL
You just take a few here and there and if those grow you can feel pretty sure the others will bewhat do you call itFather told meup to sample
Dont you think we ought to sample the fireworks
Just shut our eyes and each draw one out and then try them
But its raining cats and dogs said Jane
And Queen Anne is dead rejoined Robert
No one was in a very good temper
We neednt go out to do them we can just move back the table and let them off on the old teatray we play toboggans with
I dont know what YOU think but I think its time we did something and that would be really useful because then we shouldnt just HOPE the fireworks would make those Prossers sit upwe should KNOW
It WOULD be something to do Cyril owned with languid approval
So the table was moved back
And then the hole in the carpet that had been near the window till the carpet was turned round showed most awfully
But Anthea stole out on tiptoe and got the tray when cook wasnt looking and brought it in and put it over the hole
Then all the fireworks were put on the table and each of the four children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped something
Robert took a cracker Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles but Janes fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection the Jackinthebox that had cost two shillings and one at least of the partyI will not say which because it was sorry afterwardsdeclared that Jane had done it on purpose
Nobody was pleased
For the worst of it was that these four children with a very proper dislike of anything even faintly bordering on the sneakish had a law unalterable as those of the Medes and Persians that one had to stand by the results of a tossup or a drawing of lots or any other appeal to chance however much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out
I didnt mean to said Jane near tears
I dont care Ill draw another You know jolly well you cant said Cyril bitterly
Its settled
Its Medium and Persian
Youve done it and youll have to stand by itand us too worse luck
Never mind
YOULL have your pocketmoney before the Fifth
Anyway well have the Jackinthebox LAST and get the most out of it we can
So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted and they were all that could be expected for the money but when it came to the Jackinthebox it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them as Cyril said
They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with matches they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket of fathers secondbest overcoat that was hanging in the hall
And then Anthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms and dustpans were kept and the rosiny firelighters that smell so nice and like the woods where pinetrees grow and the old newspapers and the beeswax and turpentine and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used for cleaning brass and furniture and the paraffin for the lamps
She came back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpencehalfpenny when it was full of redcurrant jelly but the jelly had been all eaten long ago and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin
She came in and she threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was trying with the twentythird match to light the Jackinthebox
The Jackinthebox did not catch fire any more than usual but the paraffin acted quite differently and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt up and burnt off Cyrils eyelashes and scorched the faces of all four before they could spring back
They backed in four instantaneous bounds as far as they could which was to the wall and the pillar of fire reached from floor to ceiling
My hat said Cyril with emotion Youve done it this time Anthea
The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in Mr Rider Haggards exciting story about Allan Quatermain
Robert and Cyril saw that no time was to be lost
They turned up the edges of the carpet and kicked them over the tray
This cut off the column of fire and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful smell of lamps that have been turned too low
All hands now rushed to the rescue and the paraffin fire was only a bundle of trampled carpet when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their feet made the amateur firemen start back
Another crackthe carpet moved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it the Jackinthebox had at last allowed itself to be lighted and it was going off with desperate violence inside the carpet
Robert with the air of one doing the only possible thing rushed to the window and opened it
Anthea screamed Jane burst into tears and Cyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap
But the firework went on banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath the table
Next moment mother rushed in attracted by the howls of Anthea and in a few moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence and the children stood looking at each others black faces and out of the corners of their eyes at mothers white one
The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little surprise nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the immediate end of the adventure
It has been said that all roads lead to Rome this may be true but at any rate in early youth I am quite sure that many roads lead to BED and stop thereor YOU do
The rest of the fireworks were confiscated and mother was not pleased when father let them off himself in the back garden though he said Well how else can you get rid of them my dear
You see father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace and that their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden
So that they all saw the fireworks most beautifully and admired the skill with which father handled them
Next day all was forgotten and forgiven only the nursery had to be deeply cleaned like springcleaning and the ceiling had to be whitewashed
And mother went out and just at teatime next day a man came with a rolledup carpet and father paid him and mother said If the carpet isnt in good condition you know I shall expect you to change it
And the man replied There aint a thread gone in it nowhere mum
Its a bargain if ever there was one and Im moren arf sorry I let it go at the price but we cant resist the lydies can we sir
and he winked at father and went away
Then the carpet was put down in the nursery and sure enough there wasnt a hole in it anywhere
As the last fold was unrolled something hard and loudsounding bumped out of it and trundled along the nursery floor
All the children scrambled for it and Cyril got it
He took it to the gas
It was shaped like an egg very yellow and shiny halftransparent and it had an odd sort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways
It was as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showed through the stone
I MAY keep it maynt I mother
Cyril asked
And of course mother said no they must take it back to the man who had brought the carpet because she had only paid for a carpet and not for a stone egg with a fiery yolk to it
So she told them where the shop was and it was in the Kentish Town Road not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate
It was a poky little shop and the man was arranging furniture outside on the pavement very cunningly so that the more broken parts should show as little as possible
And directly he saw the children he knew them again and he began at once without giving them a chance to speak
No you dont he cried loudly I aint agoin to take back no carpets so dont you make no bloomin errer
A bargains a bargain and the carpets puffik throughout
We dont want you to take it back said Cyril but we found something in it
It must have got into it up at your place then said the man with indignant promptness for there aint nothing in nothing as I sell
Its all as clean as a whistle
I never said it wasnt CLEAN said Cyril but Oh if its MOTHS said the man thats easy cured with borax
But I expect it was only an odd one
I tell you the carpets good through and through
It hadnt got no moths when it left my andsnot so much as an hegg
But thats just it interrupted Jane there WAS so much as an egg
The man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot
Clear out I say
he shouted or Ill call for the police
A nice thing for customers to ear you acoming ere acharging me with finding things in goods what I sells
Ere be off afore I sends you off with a flea in your ears
Hi
constable The children fled and they think and their father thinks that they couldnt have done anything else
Mother has her own opinion
But father said they might keep the egg
The man certainly didnt know the egg was there when he brought the carpet said he any more than your mother did and weve as much right to it as he had
So the egg was put on the mantelpiece where it quite brightened up the dingy nursery
The nursery was dingy because it was a basement room and its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made of clinkers facing the windows
Nothing grew in the rockery except London pride and snails
The room had been described in the house agents list as a convenient breakfastroom in basement and in the daytime it was rather dark
This did not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight but then it was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable and used to come out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where their homes were and try to make friends with the children
At least I suppose that was what they wanted but the children never would
On the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre and the children were not happy because the Prossers next door had lots of fireworks and they had none
They were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden
No more playing with fire thank you was fathers answer when they asked him
When the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the fire in the nursery
Im beastly bored said Robert
Lets talk about the Psammead said Anthea who generally tried to give the conversation a cheerful turn
Whats the good of TALKING
said Cyril
What I want is for something to happen
Its awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in the evenings
Theres simply nothing to do when youve got through your homers
Jane finished the last of her homelessons and shut the book with a bang
Weve got the pleasure of memory said she
Just think of last holidays
Last holidays indeed offered something to think offor they had been spent in the country at a white house between a sandpit and a gravelpit and things had happened
The children had found a Psammead or sandfairy and it had let them have anything they wished forjust exactly anything with no bother about its not being really for their good or anything like that
And if you want to know what kind of things they wished for and how their wishes turned out you can read it all in a book called Five Children and It It was the Psammead
If youve not read it perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the baby brother who was called the Lamb because the first thing he ever said was Baa
and that the other children were not particularly handsome nor were they extra clever nor extraordinarily good
But they were not bad sorts on the whole in fact they were rather like you
I dont want to think about the pleasures of memory said Cyril I want some more things to happen
Were very much luckier than any one else as it is said Jane
Why no one else ever found a Psammead
We ought to be grateful
Why shouldnt we GO ON being though
Cyril askedlucky I mean not grateful
Whys it all got to stop
Perhaps something will happen said Anthea comfortably
Do you know sometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to
Its like that in history said Jane some kings are full of interesting things and othersnothing ever happens to them except their being born and crowned and buried and sometimes not that
I think Panthers right said Cyril I think we are the sort of people things do happen to
I have a sort of feeling things would happen right enough if we could only give them a shove
It just wants something to start it
Thats all
I wish they taught magic at school Jane sighed
I believe if we could do a little magic it might make something happen
I wonder how you begin
Robert looked round the room but he got no ideas from the faded green curtains or the drab Venetian blinds or the worn brown oilcloth on the floor
Even the new carpet suggested nothing though its pattern was a very wonderful one and always seemed as though it were just going to make you think of something
I could begin right enough said Anthea Ive read lots about it
But I believe its wrong in the Bible
Its only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt other people
I dont see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody and we dont want to hurt anybody and whats more we jolly well couldnt if we tried
Lets get the Ingoldsby Legends
Theres a thing about Abracadabra there said Cyril yawning
We may as well play at magic
Lets be Knights Templars
They were awfully gone on magic
They used to work spells or something with a goat and a goose
Father says so
Well thats all right said Robert unkindly you can play the goat right enough and Jane knows how to be a goose
Ill get Ingoldsby said Anthea hastily
You turn up the hearthrug
So they traced strange figures on the linoleum where the hearthrug had kept it clean
They traced them with chalk that Robert had nicked from the top of the mathematical masters desk at school
You know of course that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk but it is not wrong to take a broken piece so long as you only take one
I do not know the reason of this rule nor who made it
And they chanted all the gloomiest songs they could think of
And of course nothing happened
So then Anthea said Im sure a magic fire ought to be made of sweetsmelling wood and have magic gums and essences and things in it
I dont know any sweetsmelling wood except cedar said Robert but Ive got some ends of cedarwood lead pencil
So they burned the ends of lead pencil
And still nothing happened
Lets burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds said Anthea
And they did
It certainly smelt very strong
And they burned lumps of camphor out of the big chest
It was very bright and made a horrid black smoke which looked very magical
But still nothing happened
Then they got some clean teacloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen and waved them over the magic chalktracings and sang The Hymn of the Moravian Nuns at Bethlehem which is very impressive
And still nothing happened
So they waved more and more wildly and Roberts teacloth caught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece and it fell into the fender and rolled under the grate
Oh crikey
said more than one voice
And every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under the grate and there lay the egg glowing in a nest of hot ashes
Its not smashed anyhow said Robert and he put his hand under the grate and picked up the egg
But the egg was much hotter than any one would have believed it could possibly get in such a short time and Robert had to drop it with a cry of Bother
It fell on the top bar of the grate and bounced right into the glowing redhot heart of the fire
The tongs
cried Anthea
But alas no one could remember where they were
Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fish up the dolls teapot from the bottom of the water butt where the Lamb had dropped it
So the nursery tongs were resting between the waterbutt and the dustbin and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones
Never mind said Robert well get it out with the poker and the shovel
Oh stop cried Anthea
Look at it
Look
look
look
I do believe something IS going to happen
For the egg was now redhot and inside it something was moving
Next moment there was a soft cracking sound the egg burst in two and out of it came a flamecoloured bird
It rested a moment among the flames and as it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger and bigger under their eyes
Every mouth was agape every eye agoggle
The bird rose in its nest of fire stretched its wings and flew out into the room
It flew round and round and round again and where it passed the air was warm
Then it perched on the fender
The children looked at each other
Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird
It put its head on one side and looked up at him as you may have seen a parrot do when it is just going to speak so that the children were hardly astonished at all when it said Be careful I am not nearly cool yet
They were not astonished but they were very very much interested
They looked at the bird and it was certainly worth looking at
Its feathers were like gold
It was about as large as a bantam only its beak was not at all bantamshaped
I believe I know what it is said Robert
Ive seen a picture
He hurried away
A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on fathers study table yielded as the sumbooks say the desired result
But when he came back into the room holding out a paper and crying I say look here the others all said Hush
and he hushed obediently and instantly for the bird was speaking
Which of you it was saying put the egg into the fire
He did said three voices and three fingers pointed at Robert
The bird bowed at least it was more like that than anything else
I am your grateful debtor it said with a highbred air
The children were all choking with wonder and curiosityall except Robert
He held the paper in his hand and he KNEW
He said so
He said I know who you are
And he opened and displayed a printed paper at the head of which was a little picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames
You are the Phoenix said Robert and the bird was quite pleased
My fame has lived then for two thousand years it said
Allow me to look at my portrait
It looked at the page which Robert kneeling down spread out in the fender and said Its not a flattering likeness  And what are these characters
it asked pointing to the printed part
Oh thats all dullish its not much about YOU you know said Cyril with unconscious politeness but youre in lots of books
With portraits
asked the Phoenix
Well no said Cyril in fact I dont think I ever saw any portrait of you but that one but I can read you something about yourself if you like
The Phoenix nodded and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the old Encyclopedia and on page 246 he found the following Phoenix  in ornithology a fabulous bird of antiquity
Antiquity is quite correct said the Phoenix but fabulouswell do I look it
Every one shook its head
Cyril went on The ancients speak of this bird as single or the only one of its kind
Thats right enough said the Phoenix
They describe it as about the size of an eagle
Eagles are of different sizes said the Phoenix its not at all a good description
All the children were kneeling on the hearthrug to be as near the Phoenix as possible
Youll boil your brains it said
Look out Im nearly cool now and with a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table
It was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burning when it had settled itself on the tablecloth
Its only a very little scorched said the Phoenix apologetically it will come out in the wash
Please go on reading
The children gathered round the table
The size of an eagle Cyril went on its head finely crested with a beautiful plumage its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour and the rest of its body purple only the tail white and the eyes sparkling like stars
They say that it lives about five hundred years in the wilderness and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweet wood and aromatic gums fires it with the wafting of its wings and thus burns itself and that from its ashes arises a worm which in time grows up to be a Phoenix
Hence the Phoenicians gave Never mind what they gave said the Phoenix ruffling its golden feathers
They never gave much anyway they always were people who gave nothing for nothing
That book ought to be destroyed
Its most inaccurate
The rest of my body was never purple and as for mytailwell I simply ask you IS it white
It turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children
No
its not said everybody
No and it never was said the Phoenix
And that about the worm is just a vulgar insult
The Phoenix has an egg like all respectable birds
It makes a pilethat parts all rightand it lays its egg and it burns itself and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg and comes out and goes on living again and so on for ever and ever
I cant tell you how weary I got of itsuch a restless existence no repose
But how did your egg get HERE
asked Anthea
Ah thats my lifesecret said the Phoenix
I couldnt tell it to any one who wasnt really sympathetic
Ive always been a misunderstood bird
You can tell that by what they say about the worm
I might tell YOU it went on looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry
You put me on the fire Robert looked uncomfortable
The rest of us made the fire of sweetscented woods and gums though said Cyril
Andand it was an accident my putting you on the fire said Robert telling the truth with some difficulty for he did not know how the Phoenix might take it
It took it in the most unexpected manner
Your candid avowal it said removes my last scruple
I will tell you my story
And you wont vanish or anything sudden will you asked Anthea anxiously
Why
it asked puffing out the golden feathers do you wish me to stay here
Oh YES said every one with unmistakable sincerity
Why
asked the Phoenix again looking modestly at the tablecloth
Because said every one at once and then stopped short only Jane added after a pause you are the most beautiful person weve ever seen
You are a sensible child said the Phoenix and I will NOT vanish or anything sudden
And I will tell you my tale
I had resided as your book says for many thousand years in the wilderness which is a large quiet place with very little really good society and I was becoming weary of the monotony of my existence
But I acquired the habit of laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred yearsand you know how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit
Yes said Cyril Jane used to bite her nails
But I broke myself of it urged Jane rather hurt You know I did
Not till they put bitter aloes on them said Cyril
I doubt said the bird gravely whether even bitter aloes the aloe by the way has a bad habit of its own which it might well cure before seeking to cure others I allude to its indolent practice of flowering but once a century I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have cured ME
But I WAS cured
I awoke one morning from a feverish dreamit was getting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay that tedious egg upon itand I saw two people a man and a woman
They were sitting on a carpetand when I accosted them civilly they narrated to me their lifestory which as you have not yet heard it I will now proceed to relate
They were a prince and princess and the story of their parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear
In early youth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certain enchanter and in that story I am sure you will be interested
The enchanter Oh please dont said Anthea
I cant understand all these beginnings of stories and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper in them every minute
Do tell us your OWN story
Thats what we really want to hear
Well said the Phoenix seeming on the whole rather flattered to cut about seventy long stories short though I had to listen to them allbut to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time this prince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not want any one else and the enchanterdont be alarmed I wont go into his historyhad given them a magic carpet youve heard of a magic carpet
 and they had just sat on it and told it to take them right away from every oneand it had brought them to the wilderness
And as they meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet so they gave it to me
That was indeed the chance of a lifetime
I dont see what you wanted with a carpet said Jane when youve got those lovely wings
They ARE nice wings arent they
said the Phoenix simpering and spreading them out
Well I got the prince to lay out the carpet and I laid my egg on it then I said to the carpet Now my excellent carpet prove your worth
Take that egg somewhere where it cant be hatched for two thousand years and where when that times up some one will light a fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums and put the egg in to hatch and you see its all come out exactly as I said
The words were no sooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared
The royal lovers assisted to arrange my pile and soothed my last moments
I burnt myself up and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar
It pointed its claw at the grate
But the carpet said Robert the magic carpet that takes you anywhere you wish
What became of that
Oh THAT
said the Phoenix carelesslyI should say that that is the carpet
I remember the pattern perfectly
It pointed as it spoke to the floor where lay the carpet which mother had bought in the Kentish Town Road for twentytwo shillings and ninepence
At that instant fathers latchkey was heard in the door
OH whispered Cyril now we shall catch it for not being in bed
Wish yourself there said the Phoenix in a hurried whisper and then wish the carpet back in its place
No sooner said than done
It made one a little giddy certainly and a little breathless but when things seemed right way up again there the children were in bed and the lights were out
They heard the soft voice of the Phoenix through the darkness
I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains it said
Please dont mention me to your kinsfolk
Not much good said Robert theyd never believe us
I say he called through the halfopen door to the girls talk about adventures and things happening
We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magic carpet AND a Phoenix
Rather said the girls in bed
Children said father on the stairs go to sleep at once
What do you mean by talking at this time of night
No answer was expected to this question but under the bedclothes Cyril murmured one
Mean
he said
Dont know what we mean
I dont know what anything means
But weve got a magic carpet AND a Phoenix said Robert
Youll get something else if father comes in and catches you said Cyril
Shut up I tell you
Robert shut up
But he knew as well as you do that the adventures of that carpet and that Phoenix were only just beginning
Father and mother had not the least idea of what had happened in their absence
This is often the case even when there are no magic carpets or Phoenixes in the house
The next morningbut I am sure you would rather wait till the next chapter before you hear about THAT
CHAPTER 2 THE TOPLESS TOWER The children had seen the Phoenixegg hatched in the flames in their own nursery grate and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nursery floor was really the wishing carpet which would take them anywhere they chose
The carpet had transported them to bed just at the right moment and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting the windowcurtains of the boys room
Excuse me said a gentle voice and a courteous beak opened very kindly and delicately the right eye of Cyril
I hear the slaves below preparing food
Awaken
A word of explanation and arrangement 
I do wish you wouldnt The Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the cornicepole for Cyril had hit out as boys do when they are awakened suddenly and the Phoenix was not used to boys and his feelings if not his wings were hurt
Sorry said Cyril coming awake all in a minute
Do come back
What was it you were saying
Something about bacon and rations
The Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed
I sayyou ARE real said Cyril
How ripping
And the carpet
The carpet is as real as it ever was said the Phoenix rather contemptuously but of course a carpets only a carpet whereas a Phoenix is superlatively a Phoenix
Yes indeed said Cyril I see it is
Oh what luck
Wake up Bobs
Theres jolly well something to wake up for today
And its Saturday too
Ive been reflecting said the Phoenix during the silent watches of the night and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quite insufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday
The ancients were always VERY surprised
Did you by chance EXPECT my egg to hatch
Not us Cyril said
And if we had said Anthea who had come in in her nightie when she heard the silvery voice of the Phoenix we could never never have expected it to hatch anything so splendid as you
The bird smiled
Perhaps youve never seen a bird smile
You see said Anthea wrapping herself in the boys counterpane for the morning was chill weve had things happen to us before and she told the story of the Psammead or sandfairy
Ah yes said the Phoenix Psammeads were rare even in my time
I remember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert
I was always having compliments paid me I cant think why
Can YOU give wishes then
asked Jane who had now come in too
Oh dear me no said the Phoenix contemptuously at leastbut I hear footsteps approaching
I hasten to conceal myself
And it did
I think I said that this day was Saturday
It was also cooks birthday and mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with a party of friends so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make beds and to wash up the breakfast cups and little things like that
Robert and Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with the Phoenix but the bird had its own ideas about this
I must have an hour or twos quiet it said I really must
My nerves will give way unless I can get a little rest
You must remember its two thousand years since I had any conversationIm out of practice and I must take care of myself
Ive often been told that mine is a valuable life
So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of fathers which had been brought down from the boxroom some days before when a helmet was suddenly needed for a game of tournaments with its golden head under its golden wing and went to sleep
So then Robert and Cyril moved the table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves somewhere else
But before they could decide on the place Cyril said I dont know
Perhaps its rather sneakish to begin without the girls
Theyll be all the morning said Robert impatiently
And then a thing inside him which tiresome books sometimes call the inward monitor said Why dont you help them then
Cyrils inward monitor happened to say the same thing at the same moment so the boys went and helped to wash up the teacups and to dust the drawingroom
Robert was so interested that he proposed to clean the front doorstepsa thing he had never been allowed to do
Nor was he allowed to do it on this occasion
One reason was that it had already been done by cook
When all the housework was finished the girls dressed the happy wriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and threecornered hat and kept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to take him over to grannys
Mother always went to grannys every Saturday and generally some of the children went with her but today they were to keep house
And their hearts were full of joyous and delightful feelings every time they remembered that the house they would have to keep had a Phoenix in it AND a wishing carpet
You can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if you play the Noahs Ark game with him
It is quite simple
He just sits on your lap and tells you what animal he is and then you say the little poetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be
Of course some of the animals like the zebra and the tiger havent got any poetry because they are so difficult to rhyme to
The Lamb knows quite well which are the poetry animals
Im a baby bear
said the Lamb snugging down and Anthea began I love my little baby bear I love his nose and toes and hair I like to hold him in my arm And keep him VERY safe and warm
And when she said very of course there was a real bears hug
Then came the eel and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled exactly like a real one I love my little baby eel He is so squidglety to feel Hell be an eel when he is big But now hes justatiny SNIG
Perhaps you didnt know that a snig was a baby eel
It is though and the Lamb knew it
Hedgehog now
he said and Anthea went on My baby hedgehog how I like ye Though your backs so pricklyspiky Your front is very soft Ive found So I must love you front ways round
And then she loved him front ways round while he squealed with pleasure
It is a very baby game and of course the rhymes are only meant for very very small peoplenot for people who are old enough to read books so I wont tell you any more of them
By the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel and a baby rabbit and a baby rat mother was ready and she and the Lamb having been kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible to be when youre dressed for outofdoors were seen to the tram by the boys
When the boys came back every one looked at every one else and said Now
They locked the front door and they locked the back door and they fastened all the windows
They moved the table and chairs off the carpet and Anthea swept it
We must show it a LITTLE attention she said kindly
Well give it tealeaves next time
Carpets like tealeaves
Then every one put on its outdoor things because as Cyril said they didnt know where they might be going and it makes people stare if you go out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats
Then Robert gently awoke the Phoenix who yawned and stretched itself and allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet where it instantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under its golden wing as before
Then every one sat down on the carpet
Where shall we go
was of course the question and it was warmly discussed
Anthea wanted to go to Japan
Robert and Cyril voted for America and Jane wished to go to the seaside
Because there are donkeys there said she
Not in November silly said Cyril and the discussion got warmer and warmer and still nothing was settled
I vote we let the Phoenix decide said Robert at last
So they stroked it till it woke
We want to go somewhere abroad they said and we cant make up our minds where
Let the carpet make up ITS mind if it has one said the Phoenix
Just say you wish to go abroad
So they did and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down and when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to look about them they were out of doors
Out of doorsthis is a feeble way to express where they were
They were out ofout of the earth or off it
In fact they were floating steadily safely splendidly in the crisp clear air with the pale bright blue of the sky above them and far down below the pale bright sundiamonded waves of the sea
The carpet had stiffened itself somehow so that it was square and firm like a raft and it steered itself so beautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was at all afraid of tumbling off
In front of them lay land
The coast of France said the Phoenix waking up and pointing with its wing
Where do you wish to go
I should always keep one wish of coursefor emergenciesotherwise you may get into an emergency from which you cant emerge at all
But the children were far too deeply interested to listen
I tell you what said Cyril lets let the thing go on and on and when we see a place we really want to stop atwhy well just stop
Isnt this ripping
Its like trains said Anthea as they swept over the lowlying coastline and held a steady course above orderly fields and straight roads bordered with poplar treeslike express trains only in trains you never can see anything because of grownups wanting the windows shut and then they breathe on them and its like ground glass and nobody can see anything and then they go to sleep
Its like tobogganing said Robert so fast and smooth only theres no doormat to stop short onit goes on and on
You darling Phoenix said Jane its all your doing
Oh look at that ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things on their heads
Dont mention it said the Phoenix with sleepy politeness
OH
said Cyril summing up all the rapture that was in every heart
Look at it alllook at itand think of the Kentish Town Road
Every one looked and every one thought
And the glorious gliding smooth steady rush went on and they looked down on strange and beautiful things and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs and said Oh
and Ah
till it was long past dinnertime
It was Jane who suddenly said I wish wed brought that jam tart and cold mutton with us
It would have been jolly to have a picnic in the air
The jam tart and cold mutton were however far away sitting quietly in the larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposed to be keeping
A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of the raspberry jam part of the tart she had nibbled a sort of gulf or bay through the pastry edge to see whether it was the sort of dinner she could ask her little mousehusband to sit down to
She had had a very good dinner herself
It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good
Well stop as soon as we see a nice place said Anthea
Ive got threepence and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didnt cost the other day so we can buy things to eat
I expect the Phoenix can speak French
The carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and towns and farms and fields
It reminded everybody of a certain time when all of them had had wings and had flown up to the top of a church tower and had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread and sodawater
And this again reminded them how hungry they were
And just as they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed they saw ahead of them some ruined walls on a hill and strong and upright and really to look at as good as newa great square tower
The top of thats just the exactly same size as the carpet said Jane
I think it would be good to go to the top of that because then none of the AbbywhatsitsnamesI mean nativeswould be able to take the carpet away even if they wanted to
And some of us could go out and get things to eatbuy them honestly I mean not take them out of larder windows
I think it would be better if we went Anthea was beginning but Jane suddenly clenched her hands
I dont see why I should never do anything I want just because Im the youngest
I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top of that towerso there
The carpet made a disconcerting bound and next moment it was hovering above the square top of the tower
Then slowly and carefully it began to sink under them
It was like a lift going down with you at the Army and Navy Stores
I dont think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them first said Robert huffishly
Hullo
What on earth
For unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the four sides of the carpet
It was as if a wall were being built by magic quickness
It was a foot highit was two feet highthree four five
It was shutting out the lightmore and more
Anthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet above them
Were dropping into the tower she screamed
THERE WASNT ANY TOP TO IT
So the carpets going to fit itself in at the bottom
Robert sprang to his feet
We ought to haveHullo
an owls nest
He put his knee on a jutting smooth piece of grey stone and reached his hand into a deep window slitbroad to the inside of the tower and narrowing like a funnel to the outside
Look sharp
cried every one but Robert did not look sharp enough
By the time he had drawn his hand out of the owls nestthere were no eggs therethe carpet had sunk eight feet below him
Jump you silly cuckoo
cried Cyril with brotherly anxiety
But Robert couldnt turn round all in a minute into a jumping position
He wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge and by the time he was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feet above the others who were still sinking with the carpet and Robert found himself in the embrasure of a window alone for even the owls were not at home that day
The wall was smoothish there was no climbing up and as for climbing downRobert hid his face in his hands and squirmed back and back from the giddy verge until the back part of him was wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit
He was safe now of course but the outside part of his window was like a frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower
It was very pretty with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems but between him and it there was the width of the tower and nothing in it but empty air
The situation was terrible
Robert saw in a flash that the carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tight places that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted them
And the othersimagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly and steadily to the very bottom of the tower leaving Robert clinging to the wall
Robert did not even try to imagine their feelingshe had quite enough to do with his own but you can
As soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of the inside of the tower it suddenly lost that raftlike stiffness which had been such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the topless tower and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthy mounds at the bottom of the tower just exactly like any ordinary carpet
Also it shrank suddenly so that it seemed to draw away from under their feet and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood on the firm ground while the carpet drew itself in till it was its proper size and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower but left quite a big space all round it
Then across the carpet they looked at each other and then every chin was tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert had got to
Of course they couldnt see him
I wish we hadnt come said Jane
You always do said Cyril briefly
Look here we cant leave Robert up there
I wish the carpet would fetch him down
The carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together
It stiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of the tower
The children below craned their heads back and nearly broke their necks in doing it
The carpet rose and rose
It hung poised darkly above them for an anxious moment or two then it dropped down again threw itself on the uneven floor of the tower and as it did so it tumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower
Oh glory
said Robert that was a squeak
You dont know how I felt
I say Ive had about enough for a bit
Lets wish ourselves at home again and have a go at that jam tart and mutton
We can go out again afterwards
Righto
said every one for the adventure had shaken the nerves of all
So they all got on to the carpet again and said I wish we were at home
And lo and behold they were no more at home than before
The carpet never moved
The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to sleep
Anthea woke it up gently
Look here she said
Im looking said the Phoenix
We WISHED to be at home and were still here complained Jane
No said the Phoenix looking about it at the high dark walls of the tower
No I quite see that
But we wished to be at home said Cyril
No doubt said the bird politely
And the carpet hasnt moved an inch said Robert
No said the Phoenix I see it hasnt
But I thought it was a wishing carpet
So it is said the Phoenix
Then why
asked the children altogether
I did tell you you know said the Phoenix only you are so fond of listening to the music of your own voices
It is indeed the most lovely music to each of us and therefore You did tell us WHAT
interrupted an Exasperated
Why that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOUVE HAD THEM
There was a heartfelt silence
Then how are we going to get home
said Cyril at last
I havent any idea replied the Phoenix kindly
Can I fly out and get you any little thing
How could you carry the money to pay for it
It isnt necessary
Birds always take what they want
It is not regarded as stealing except in the case of magpies
The children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to be the case on the day when they had wings and had enjoyed somebody elses ripe plums
Yes let the Phoenix get us something to eat anyway Robert urged If it will be so kind you mean corrected Anthea in a whisper if it will be so kind and we can be thinking while its gone
So the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and vanished at the top and it was not till it had quite gone that Jane said Suppose it never comes back
It was not a pleasant thought and though Anthea at once said Of course it will come back Im certain its a bird of its word a further gloom was cast by the idea
For curiously enough there was no door to the tower and all the windows were far far too high to be reached by the most adventurous climber
It was cold too and Anthea shivered
Yes said Cyril its like being at the bottom of a well
The children waited in a sad and hungry silence and got little stiff necks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of the tall grey tower to see if the Phoenix were coming
At last it came
It looked very big as it fluttered down between the walls and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness was caused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw
In the other it held a piece of bread
And in its beak was a very large pear
The pear was juicy and as good as a very small drink
When the meal was over every one felt better and the question of how to get home was discussed without any disagreeableness
But no one could think of any way out of the difficulty or even out of the tower for the Phoenix though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough to carry food for them was plainly not equal to flying through the air with four wellnourished children
We must stay here I suppose said Robert at last and shout out every now and then and some one will hear us and bring ropes and ladders and rescue us like out of mines and theyll get up a subscription to send us home like castaways
Yes but we shant be home before mother is and then fatherll take away the carpet and say its dangerous or something said Cyril
I DO wish we hadnt come said Jane
And every one else said Shut up except Anthea who suddenly awoke the Phoenix and said Look here I believe YOU can help us
Oh I do wish you would
I will help you as far as lies in my power said the Phoenix at once
What is it you want now
Why we want to get home said every one
Oh said the Phoenix
Ah hum
Yes
Home you said
Meaning
Where we livewhere we slept last nightwhere the altar is that your egg was hatched on
Oh there
said the Phoenix
Well Ill do my best
It fluttered on to the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes in deep thought
Then it drew itself up proudly
I CAN help you it said
I am almost sure I can help you
Unless I am grossly deceived I can help you
You wont mind my leaving you for an hour or two
and without waiting for a reply it soared up through the dimness of the tower into the brightness above
Now said Cyril firmly it said an hour or two
But Ive read about captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and things awaiting release and I know each moment is an eternity
Those people always do something to pass the desperate moments
Its no use our trying to tame spiders because we shant have time
I HOPE not said Jane doubtfully
But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something
I say talking of stones said Robert you see that heap of stones against the wall over in that corner
Well Im certain theres a hole in the wall thereand I believe its a door
Yes look herethe stones are round like an arch in the wall and heres the holeits all black inside
He had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to itdislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark space
Next moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones and very soon every one threw off its jacket for it was warm work
It IS a door said Cyril wiping his face and not a bad thing either if He was going to add if anything happens to the Phoenix but he didnt for fear of frightening Jane
He was not an unkind boy when he had leisure to think of such things
The arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger
It was very very black even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of the tower it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stones and throwing them down into another heap
The stones must have been there a very long time for they were covered with moss and some of them were stuck together by it
So it was fairly hard work as Robert pointed out
When the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch and the tower Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on the inside and lit matches
How thankful they felt then that they had a sensible father who did not forbid them to carry matches as some boys fathers do
The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matches being of the kind that strike only on the box
Its not a door its a sort of tunnel Robert cried to the girls after the first match had flared up flickered and gone out
Stand offwell push some more stones down
They did amid deep excitement
And now the stone heap was almost goneand before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknown things
All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in this thrilling moment
It was like Monte Cristoit was like I say cried Anthea suddenly come out
Theres always bad air in places that have been shut up
It makes your torches go out and then you die
Its called firedamp I believe
Come out I tell you
The urgency of her tone actually brought the boys outand then every one took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it so as to make the air fresh inside
When Anthea thought the air inside must be freshened by now Cyril led the way into the arch
The girls followed and Robert came last because Jane refused to tail the procession lest something should come in after her and catch at her from behind
Cyril advanced cautiously lighting match after match and peerIng before him
Its a vaulting roof he said and its all stoneall right Panther dont keep pulling at my jacket
The air must be all right because of the matches silly and there arelook outthere are steps down
Oh dont lets go any farther said Jane in an agony of reluctance a very painful thing by the way to be in
Im sure there are snakes or dens of lions or something
Do lets go back and come some other time with candles and bellows for the firedamp
Let me get in front of you then said the stern voice of Robert from behind
This is exactly the place for buried treasure and Im going on anyway you can stay behind if you like
And then of course Jane consented to go on
So very slowly and carefully the children went down the stepsthere were seventeen of themand at the bottom of the steps were more passages branching four ways and a sort of low arch on the righthand side made Cyril wonder what it could be for it was too low to be the beginning of another passage
So he knelt down and lit a match and stooping very low he peeped in
Theres SOMETHING he said and reached out his hand
It touched something that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything else that Cyril had ever touched
I believe it IS a buried treasure he cried
And it was for even as Anthea cried Oh hurry up Squirrelfetch it out
Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bagabout as big as the paper ones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence
Theres more of it a lot more he said
As he pulled the rotten bag gave way and the gold coins ran and span and jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the dark passage
I wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried treasure
What Cyril said was Oh botherIve burnt my fingers
and as he spoke he dropped the match
AND IT WAS THE LAST
he added
There was a moment of desperate silence
Then Jane began to cry
Dont said Anthea dont Pussyyoull exhaust the air if you cry
We can get out all right
Yes said Jane through her sobs and find the Phoenix has come back and gone away againbecause it thought wed gone home some other way andOh I WISH we hadnt come
Every one stood quite stillonly Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and tried to wipe her eyes in the dark
DDONT said Jane thats my EARIm not crying with my ears
Come lets get on out said Robert but that was not so easy for no one could remember exactly which way they had come
It is very difficult to remember things in the dark unless you have matches with you and then of course it is quite different even if you dont strike one
Every one had come to agree with Janes constant wishand despair was making the darkness blacker than ever when quite suddenly the floor seemed to tip upand a strong sensation of being in a whirling lift came upon every one
All eyes were closedones eyes always are in the dark dont you think
When the whirling feeling stopped Cyril said Earthquakes
and they all opened their eyes
They were in their own dingy breakfastroom at home and oh how light and bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemed after that dark underground tunnel
The carpet lay on the floor looking as calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life
On the mantelpiece stood the Phoenix waiting with an air of modest yet sterling worth for the thanks of the children
But how DID you do it
they asked when every one had thanked the Phoenix again and again
Oh I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead
But how DID you know where to find it
I found that out from the carpet these wishing creatures always know all about each othertheyre so clannish like the Scots you knowall related
But the carpet cant talk can it
No
Then how How did I get the Psammeads address
I tell you I got it from the carpet
DID it speak then
No said the Phoenix thoughtfully it didnt speak but I gathered my information from something in its manner
I was always a singularly observant bird
it was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart as well as the tea and breadandbutter that any one found time to regret the golden treasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the underground passage and which indeed no one had thought of till now since the moment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match
What owls and goats we were
said Robert
Look how weve always wanted treasureand now Never mind said Anthea trying as usual to make the best of it
Well go back again and get it all and then well give everybody presents
More than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging what presents should be given to whom and when the claims of generosity had been satisfied the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buy for themselves
It was Cyril who broke in on Roberts almost too technical account of the motorcar on which he meant to go to and from school There
he said
Dry up
Its no good
We cant ever go back
We dont know where it is
Dont YOU know
Jane asked the Phoenix wistfully
Not in the least the Phoenix replied in a tone of amiable regret
Then weve lost the treasure said Cyril
And they had
But weve got the carpet and the Phoenix said Anthea
Excuse me said the bird with an air of wounded dignity I do SO HATE to seem to interfere but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and the carpet
CHAPTER 3 THE QUEEN COOK It was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journey on the wishing carpet
Unless you are too young to read at all you will know that the next day must have been Sunday
Sunday at 18 Camden Terrace Camden Town was always a very pretty day
Father always brought home flowers on Saturday so that the breakfasttable was extra beautiful
In November of course the flowers were chrysanthemums yellow and coppery coloured
Then there were always sausages on toast for breakfast and these are rapture after six days of Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling
On this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner a kind of food that is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions and there was an angel pudding when rice and milk and oranges and white icing do their best to make you happy
After dinner father was very sleepy indeed because he had been working hard all the week but he did not yield to the voice that said Go and have an hours rest
He nursed the Lamb who had a horrid cough that cook said was whoopingcough as sure as eggs and he said Come along kiddies Ive got a ripping book from the library called The Golden Age and Ill read it to you
Mother settled herself on the drawingroom sofa and said she could listen quite nicely with her eyes shut
The Lamb snugged into the armchair corner of daddys arm and the others got into a happy heap on the hearthrug
At first of course there were too many feet and knees and shoulders and elbows but real comfort was actually settling down on them and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the back top shelf of their minds beautiful things that could be taken out and played with later when a surly solid knock came at the drawingroom door
It opened an angry inch and the cooks voice said Please m may I speak to you a moment
Mother looked at father with a desperate expression
Then she put her pretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa and stood up in them and sighed
As good fish in the sea said father cheerfully and it was not till much later that the children understood what he meant
Mother went out into the passage which is called the hall where the umbrellastand is and the picture of the Monarch of the Glen in a yellow shining frame with brown spots on the Monarch from the damp in the house before last and there was cook very red and damp in the face and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one that she had dished up those dear delightful chickens in
She stood there and she seemed to get redder and damper and she twisted the corner of her apron round her fingers and she said very shortly and fiercely If you please maam I should wish to leave at my day month
Mother leaned against the hatstand
The children could see her looking pale through the crack of the door because she had been very kind to the cook and had given her a holiday only the day before and it seemed so very unkind of the cook to want to go like this and on a Sunday too
Why whats the matter
mother said
Its them children the cook replied and somehow the children all felt that they had known it from the first
They did not remember having done anything extra wrong but it is so frightfully easy to displease a cook
Its them children theres that there new carpet in their room covered thick with mud both sides beastly yellow mud and sakes alive knows where they got it
And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday
Its not my place and its not my intentions so I dont deceive you maam and but for them limbs which they is if ever there was its not a bad place though I says it and I wouldnt wish to leave but Im very sorry said mother gently
I will speak to the children
And you had better think it over and if you REALLY wish to go tell me tomorrow
Next day mother had a quiet talk with cook and cook said she didnt mind if she stayed on a bit just to see
But meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into thoroughly by father and mother
Janes candid explanation that the mud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buried treasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the others limited their defence to an expression of sorrow and of a determination not to do it again
But father said and mother agreed with him because mothers have to agree with fathers and not because it was her own idea that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thick mud and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk silly nonsensethat meant Janes truthful statementwere not fit to have a carpet at all and indeed SHOULDNT have one for a week
So the carpet was brushed with tealeaves too which was the only comfort Anthea could think of and folded up and put away in the cupboard at the top of the stairs and daddy put the key in his trousers pocket
Till Saturday said he
Never mind said Anthea weve got the Phoenix
But as it happened they hadnt
The Phoenix was nowhere to be found and everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty of magic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November life in Camden Townand there was the nursery floor all bare boards in the middle and brown oilcloth round the outside and the bareness and yellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terrible distinctness when the poor things came out in the evening as usual to try to make friends with the children
But the children never would
The Sunday ended in gloom which even junket for supper in the blue Dresden bowl could hardly lighten at all
Next day the Lambs cough was worse
It certainly seemed very whoopy and the doctor came in his brougham carriage
Every one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it was to know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix mislaid
A good deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix
Its a bird of its word said Anthea
Im sure its not deserted us
But you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to near Rochester and back and I expect the poor things feeling tired out and wants rest
I am sure we may trust it
The others tried to feel sure of this too but it was hard
No one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook since it was entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mud that the carpet had been taken away
She might have told us said Jane and Panther and I would have cleaned it with tealeaves
Shes a cantankerous cat said Robert
I shant say what I think about her said Anthea primly because it would be evil speaking lying and slandering
Its not lying to say shes a disagreeable pig and a beastly bluenosed Bozwoz said Cyril who had read The Eyes of Light and intended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk like Paul
And all the children even Anthea agreed that even if she wasnt a bluenosed Bozwoz they wished cook had never been born
But I ask you to believe that they didnt do all the things on purpose which so annoyed the cook during the following week though I daresay the things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite
This is a mystery
Explain it if you can
The things that had happened were as follows SundayDiscovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet
MondayLiquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan
Anthea did this because she thought it would be good for the Lambs cough
The whole thing forgotten and bottom of saucepan burned out
It was the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the babys milk
TuesdayA dead mouse found in pantry
Fishslice taken to dig grave with
By regrettable accident fishslice broken
Defence The cook oughtnt to keep dead mice in pantries
WednesdayChopped suet left on kitchen table
Robert added chopped soap but he says he thought the suet was soap too
ThursdayBroke the kitchen window by falling against it during a perfectly fair game of bandits in the area
FridayStopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sink with water to make a lake to sail paper boats in
Went away and left the tap running
Kitchen hearthrug and cooks shoes ruined
On Saturday the carpet was restored
There had been plenty of time during the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they did get it back
Mother had gone over to grannys and had not taken the Lamb because he had a bad cough which cook repeatedly said was whoopingcough as sure as eggs is eggs
But well take him out a ducky darling said Anthea
Well take him somewhere where you cant have whoopingcough
Dont be so silly Robert
If he DOES talk about it no onell take any notice
Hes always talking about things hes never seen
So they dressed the Lamb and themselves in outofdoors clothes and the Lamb chuckled and coughed and laughed and coughed again poor dear and all the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys while Jane nursed the Lamb and Anthea rushed through the house in one last wild hunt for the missing Phoenix
Its no use waiting for it she said reappearing breathless in the breakfastroom
But I know it hasnt deserted us
Its a bird of its word
Quite so said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table
Every one fell on its knees and looked up and there was the Phoenix perched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table and had once supported a drawer in the happy days before the drawer had been used as a boat and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggetts Really Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert
Ive been here all the time said the Phoenix yawning politely behind its claw
If you wanted me you should have recited the ode of invocation its seven thousand lines long and written in very pure and beautiful Greek
Couldnt you tell it us in English
asked Anthea
Its rather long isnt it
said Jane jumping the Lamb on her knee
Couldnt you make a short English version like Tate and Brady
Oh come along do said Robert holding out his hand
Come along good old Phoenix
Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix it corrected shyly
Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix then
Come along come along said Robert impatiently with his hand still held out
The Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist
This amiable youth it said to the others has miraculously been able to put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocation into one English hexametera little misplaced some of the wordsbut Oh come along come along good old beautiful Phoenix
Not perfect I admitbut not bad for a boy of his age
Well now then said Robert stepping back on to the carpet with the golden Phoenix on his wrist
You look like the kings falconer said Jane sitting down on the carpet with the baby on her lap
Robert tried to go on looking like it
Cyril and Anthea stood on the carpet
We shall have to get back before dinner said Cyril or cook will blow the gaff
She hasnt sneaked since Sunday said Anthea
She Robert was beginning when the door burst open and the cook fierce and furious came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner of the carpet with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other which was clenched
Look ere
she cried my only basin and what the powers am I to make the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for your dinners
You dont deserve no dinners so yer dont
Im awfully sorry cook said Anthea gently it was my fault and I forgot to tell you about it
It got broken when we were telling our fortunes with melted lead you know and I meant to tell you
Meant to tell me replied the cook she was red with anger and really I dont wondermeant to tell
Well I mean to tell too
Ive held my tongue this week through because the missus she said to me quiet like We mustnt expect old heads on young shoulders but now I shant hold it no longer
There was the soap you put in our pudding and me and Eliza never so much as breathed it to your mathough well we mightand the saucepan and the fishslice andMy gracious cats alive
what ave you got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for
We arent going to take him out said Anthea at least She stopped short for though they werent going to take him out in the Kentish Town Road they certainly intended to take him elsewhere
But not at all where cook meant when she said out
This confused the truthful Anthea
Out
said the cook that Ill take care you dont and she snatched the Lamb from the lap of Jane while Anthea and Robert caught her by the skirts and apron
Look here said Cyril in stern desperation will you go away and make your pudding in a piedish or a flowerpot or a hotwater can or something
Not me said the cook briefly and leave this precious poppet for you to give his deathercold to
I warn you said Cyril solemnly
Beware ere yet it be too late
 Late yourself the little popseywopsey said the cook with angry tenderness
They shant take it out no more they shant
AndWhere did you get that there yellow fowl
She pointed to the Phoenix
Even Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss would be theirs
I wish she said suddenly we were on a sunny southern shore where there cant be any whoopingcough
She said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb and the sturdy scoldings of the cook and instantly the giddygoroundandfallinglift feeling swept over the whole party and the cook sat down flat on the carpet holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout printcovered self and calling on St Bridget to help her
She was an Irishwoman
The moment the tipsytopsyturvy feeling stopped the cook opened her eyes gave one sounding screech and shut them again and Anthea took the opportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms
Its all right she said own Panthers got you
Look at the trees and the sand and the shells and the great big tortoises
Oh DEAR how hot it is
It certainly was for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a southern shore that was sunny and no mistake as Robert remarked
The greenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palmtrees and all the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho
and Fair Play were growing in rich profusion
Between the green green slope and the blue blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpet of jewelled cloth of gold for it was not greyish as our northern sand is but yellow and changingopalcoloured like sunshine and rainbows
And at the very moment when the wild whirling blinding deafening tumbling upsidedownness of the carpetmoving stopped the children had the happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edge of the sea and disappear in the water
And it was hotter than you can possibly imagine unless you think of ovens on a bakingday
Every one without an instants hesitation tore off its LondoninNovember outdoor clothes and Anthea took off the Lambs highwayman blue coat and his threecornered hat and then his jersey and then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tight breeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white shirt
Im sure its much warmer than the seaside in the summer said Anthea
Mother always lets us go barefoot then
So the Lambs shoes and socks and gaiters came off and he stood digging his happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand
Im a little white duckdickie said hea little white duckdickie what swims and splashed quacking into a sandy pool
Let him said Anthea it cant hurt him
Oh how hot it is
The cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed shut them screamed again opened her eyes once more and said Why drat my cats alive whats all this
Its a dream I expect
Well its the best I ever dreamed
Ill look it up in the dreambook tomorrow
Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on
I never did
Look here said Cyril it isnt a dream its real
Ho yes
said the cook they always says that in dreams
Its REAL I tell you Robert said stamping his foot
Im not going to tell you how its done because thats our secret
He winked heavily at each of the others in turn
But you wouldnt go away and make that pudding so we HAD to bring you and I hope you like it
I do that and no mistake said the cook unexpectedly and it being a dream it dont matter what I say and I WILL say if its my last word that of all the aggravating little varmints Calm yourself my good woman said the Phoenix
Good woman indeed said the cook good woman yourself Then she saw who it was that had spoken
Well if I ever said she this is something like a dream
Yellow fowls atalking and all
Ive heard of such but never did I think to see the day
Well then said Cyril impatiently sit here and see the day now
Its a jolly fine day
Here you othersa council
They walked along the shore till they were out of earshot of the cook who still sat gazing about her with a happy dreamy vacant smile
Look here said Cyril we must roll the carpet up and hide it so that we can get at it at any moment
The Lamb can be getting rid of his whoopingcough all the morning and we can look about and if the savages on this island are cannibals well hook it and take her back
And if not well LEAVE HER HERE
Is that being kind to servants and animals like the clergyman said
asked Jane
Nor she isnt kind retorted Cyril
Wellanyway said Anthea the safest thing is to leave the carpet there with her sitting on it
Perhaps itll be a lesson to her and anyway if she thinks its a dream it wont matter what she says when she gets home
So the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet
Cyril shouldered the well and happy Lamb the Phoenix perched on Roberts wrist and the party of explorers prepared to enter the interior
The grassy slope was smooth but under the trees there were tangled creepers with bright strangeshaped flowers and it was not easy to walk
We ought to have an explorers axe said Robert
I shall ask father to give me one for Christmas
There were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from the trees and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their faces
Now tell me honestly said the Phoenix are there any birds here handsomer than I am
Dont be afraid of hurting my feelingsIm a modest bird I hope
Not one of them said Robert with conviction is a patch upon you
I was never a vain bird said the Phoenix but I own that you confirm my own impression
I will take a flight
It circled in the air for a moment and returning to Roberts wrist went on There is a path to the left
And there was
So now the children went on through the wood more quickly and comfortably the girls picking flowers and the Lamb inviting the pretty dickies to observe that he himself was a little white realwaterwet duck
And all this time he hadnt whoopingcoughed once
The path turned and twisted and always threading their way amid a tangle of flowers the children suddenly passed a corner and found themselves in a forest clearing where there were a lot of pointed hutsthe huts as they knew at once of SAVAGES
The boldest heart beat more quickly
Suppose they WERE cannibals
It was a long way back to the carpet
Hadnt we better go back
said Jane
Go NOW she said and her voice trembled a little
Suppose they eat us
Nonsense Pussy said Cyril firmly
Look theres a goat tied up
That shows they dont eat PEOPLE
Lets go on and say were missionaries Robert suggested
I shouldnt advise THAT said the Phoenix very earnestly
Why not
Well for one thing it isnt true replied the golden bird
It was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that a tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts
He had hardly any clothes and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery colourjust like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on Saturday
In his hand he held a spear
The whites of his eyes and the white of his teeth were the only light things about him except that where the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white too
If you will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next to nothing on you will see at onceif the sun happens to be shining at the timethat I am right about this
The savage looked at the children
Concealment was impossible
He uttered a shout that was more like Oo goggery bagwag than anything else the children had ever heard and at once brown coppery people leapt out of every hut and swarmed like ants about the clearing
There was no time for discussion and no one wanted to discuss anything anyhow
Whether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to matter very little
Without an instants hesitation the four children turned and ran back along the forest path the only pause was Antheas
She stood back to let Cyril pass because he was carrying the Lamb who screamed with delight
He had not whoopingcoughed a single once since the carpet landed him on the island
Geeup Squirrel geegee he shouted and Cyril did geeup
The path was a shorter cut to the beach than the creepercovered way by which they had come and almost directly they saw through the trees the shining blueandgoldandopal of sand and sea
Stick to it cried Cyril breathlessly
They did stick to it they tore down the sandsthey could hear behind them as they ran the patter of feet which they knew too well were coppercoloured
The sands were golden and opalcolouredand BARE
There were wreaths of tropic seaweed there were rich tropic shells of the kind you would not buy in the Kentish Town Road under at least fifteen pence a pair
There were turtles basking lumpily on the waters edgebut no cook no clothes and no carpet
On on
Into the sea
gasped Cyril
They MUST hate water
Iveheardsavages alwaysdirty
Their feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathless words were ended
The calm babywaves were easy to go through
It is warm work running for your life in the tropics and the coolness of the water was delicious
They were up to their armpits now and Jane was up to her chin
Look
said the Phoenix
What are they pointing at
The children turned and there a little to the west was a heada head they knew with a crooked cap upon it
It was the head of the cook
For some reason or other the savages had stopped at the waters edge and were all talking at the top of their voices and all were pointing coppercoloured fingers stiff with interest and excitement at the head of the cook
The children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let them
What on earth did you come out here for
Robert shouted and where on earths the carpet
Its not on earth bless you replied the cook happily its UNDER MEin the water
I got a bit warm setting there in the sun and I just says I wish I was in a cold bathjust like thatand next minute here I was
Its all part of the dream
Every one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the carpet had had the sense to take the cook to the nearest and largest baththe sea and how terrible it would have been if the carpet had taken itself and her to the stuffy little bathroom of the house in Camden Town
Excuse me said the Phoenixs soft voice breaking in on the general sigh of relief but I think these brown people want your cook
Toto eat
whispered Jane as well as she could through the water which the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy fat hands and feet
Hardly rejoined the bird
Who wants cooks to EAT
Cooks are ENGAGED not eaten
They wish to engage her
How can you understand what they say
asked Cyril doubtfully
Its as easy as kissing your claw replied the bird
I speak and understand ALL languages even that of your cook which is difficult and unpleasing
Its quite easy when you know how its done
It just comes to you
I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargothe cook I mean
You can take my word for it the coppercoloured ones will not harm you now
It is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells you to
So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet and pulling it from under the cook towed it slowly in through the shallowing water and at last spread it on the sand
The cook who had followed instantly sat down on it and at once the coppercoloured natives now strangely humble formed a ring round the carpet and fell on their faces on the rainbowandgold sand
The tallest savage spoke in this position which must have been very awkward for him and Jane noticed that it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of his mouth afterwards
He says the Phoenix remarked after some time that they wish to engage your cook permanently
Without a character
asked Anthea who had heard her mother speak of such things
They do not wish to engage her as cook but as queen and queens need not have characters
There was a breathless pause
WELL said Cyril of all the choices
But theres no accounting for tastes
Every one laughed at the idea of the cooks being engaged as queen they could not help it
I do not advise laughter warned the Phoenix ruffling out his golden feathers which were extremely wet
And its not their own choice
It seems that there is an ancient prophecy of this coppercoloured tribe that a great queen should some day arise out of the sea with a white crown on her head andandwell you see
Theres the crown
It pointed its claw at cooks cap and a very dirty cap it was because it was the end of the week
Thats the white crown it said at least its nearly whitevery white indeed compared to the colour THEY areand anyway its quite white enough
Cyril addressed the cook
Look here
said he these brown people want you to be their queen
Theyre only savages and they dont know any better
Now would you really like to stay
or if youll promise not to be so jolly aggravating at home and not to tell any one a word about today well take you back to Camden Town
No you dont said the cook in firm undoubting tones
Ive always wanted to be the Queen God bless her
and I always thought what a good one I should make and now Im going to
IF its only in a dream its well worth while
And I dont go back to that nasty underground kitchen and me blamed for everything that I dont not till the dreams finished and I wake up with that nasty bell a rangtanging in my earsso I tell you
Are you SURE Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix that she will be quite safe here
She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing said the bird solemnly
Thereyou hear said Cyril
Youre in for a precious soft thing so mind youre a good queen cook
Its more than youd any right to expect but long may you reign
Some of the cooks coppercoloured subjects now advanced from the forest with long garlands of beautiful flowers white and sweetscented and hung them respectfully round the neck of their new sovereign
What
all them lovely bokays for me
exclaimed the enraptured cook
Well this here is something LIKE a dream I must say
She sat up very straight on the carpet and the coppercoloured ones themselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers madly stuck parrot feathers in their hair and began to dance
It was a dance such as you have never seen it made the children feel almost sure that the cook was right and that they were all in a dream
Small strangeshaped drums were beaten oddsounding songs were sung and the dance got faster and faster and odder and odder till at last all the dancers fell on the sand tired out
The new queen with her white crowncap all on one side clapped wildly
Brayvo
she cried brayvo
Its better than the Albert Edward Musichall in the Kentish Town Road
Go it again
But the Phoenix would not translate this request into the coppercoloured language and when the savages had recovered their breath they implored their queen to leave her white escort and come with them to their huts
The finest shall be yours O queen said they
Wellso long
said the cook getting heavily on to her feet when the Phoenix had translated this request
No more kitchens and attics for me thank you
Im off to my royal palace I am and I only wish this here dream would keep on for ever and ever
She picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet and the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and worn elasticside boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest surrounded by her dusky retainers singing songs of rejoicing as they went
WELL
said Cyril I suppose shes all right but they dont seem to count us for much one way or the other
Oh said the Phoenix they think youre merely dreams
The prophecy said that the queen would arise from the waves with a white crown and surrounded by white dreamchildren
Thats about what they think YOU are
And what about dinner
said Robert abruptly
There wont be any dinner with no cook and no puddingbasin Anthea reminded him but theres always breadandbutter
Lets get home said Cyril
The Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes again but Anthea and Jane managed it by force disguised as coaxing and he never once whoopingcoughed
Then every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the carpet
A sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where the coppercoloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and respect to their whitecrowned queen
Then Anthea said Home just as duchesses and other people do to their coachmen and the intelligent carpet in one whirling moment laid itself down in its proper place on the nursery floor
And at that very moment Eliza opened the door and said Cooks gone
I cant find her anywhere and theres no dinner ready
She hasnt taken her box nor yet her outdoor things
She just ran out to see the time I shouldnt wonderthe kitchen clock never did give her satisfactionand shes got run over or fell down in a fit as likely as not
Youll have to put up with the cold bacon for your dinners and what on earth youve got your outdoor things on for I dont know
And then Ill slip out and see if they know anything about her at the policestation
But nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more except the children and later one other person
Mother was so upset at losing the cook and so anxious about her that Anthea felt most miserable as though she had done something very wrong indeed
She woke several times in the night and at last decided that she would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her mother all about it
But there was no opportunity to do this next day because the Phoenix as usual had gone to sleep in some outoftheway spot after asking as a special favour not to be disturbed for twentyfour hours
The Lamb never whoopingcoughed once all that Sunday and mother and father said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given him
But the children knew that it was the southern shore where you cant have whoopingcough that had cured him
The Lamb babbled of coloured sand and water but no one took any notice of that
He often talked of things that hadnt happened
It was on Monday morning very early indeed that Anthea woke and suddenly made up her mind
She crept downstairs in her nightgown it was very chilly sat down on the carpet and with a beating heart wished herself on the sunny shore where you cant have whoopingcough and next moment there she was
The sand was splendidly warm
She could feel it at once even through the carpet
She folded the carpet and put it over her shoulders like a shawl for she was determined not to be parted from it for a single instant no matter how hot it might be to wear
Then trembling a little and trying to keep up her courage by saying over and over It is my DUTY it IS my duty she went up the forest path
Well here you are again said the cook directly she saw Anthea
This dream does keep on
The cook was dressed in a white robe she had no shoes and stockings and no cap and she was sitting under a screen of palmleaves for it was afternoon in the island and blazing hot
She wore a flower wreath on her hair and coppercoloured boys were fanning her with peacocks feathers
Theyve got the cap put away she said
They seem to think a lot of it
Never saw one before I expect
Are you happy
asked Anthea panting the sight of the cook as queen quite took her breath away
I believe you my dear said the cook heartily
Nothing to do unless you want to
But Im getting rested now
Tomorrow Im going to start cleaning out my hut if the dream keeps on and I shall teach them cooking they burns everything to a cinder now unless they eats it raw
But can you talk to them
Lor love a duck yes
the happy cookqueen replied its quite easy to pick up
I always thought I should be quick at foreign languages
Ive taught them to understand dinner and I want a drink and You leave me be already
Then you dont want anything
Anthea asked earnestly and anxiously
Not me miss except if youd only go away
Im afraid of me waking up with that bell agoing if you keep on stopping here atalking to me
Long as this here dream keeps up Im as happy as a queen
Goodbye then said Anthea gaily for her conscience was clear now
She hurried into the wood threw herself on the ground and said Homeand there she was rolled in the carpet on the nursery floor
SHES all right anyhow said Anthea and went back to bed
Im glad somebodys pleased
But mother will never believe me when I tell her
The story is indeed a little difficult to believe
Still you might try
CHAPTER 4 TWO BAZAARS Mother was really a great dear
She was pretty and she was loving and most frightfully good when you were ill and always kind and almost always just
That is she was just when she understood things
But of course she did not always understand things
No one understands everything and mothers are not angels though a good many of them come pretty near it
The children knew that mother always WANTED to do what was best for them even if she was not clever enough to know exactly what was the best
That was why all of them but much more particularly Anthea felt rather uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her of the wishing carpet and the Phoenix
And Anthea whose inside mind was made so that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others had decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth however little likely it was that her mother would believe it
Then I shall have done whats right said she to the Phoenix and if she doesnt believe me it wont be my faultwill it
Not in the least said the golden bird
And she wont so youre quite safe
Anthea chose a time when she was doing her homelessonsthey were Algebra and Latin German English and Euclidand she asked her mother whether she might come and do them in the drawingroomso as to be quiet she said to her mother and to herself she said And thats not the real reason
I hope I shant grow up a LIAR
Mother said Of course dearie and Anthea started swimming through a sea of xs and ys and zs
Mother was sitting at the mahogany bureau writing letters
Mother dear said Anthea
Yes loveaduck said mother
About cook said Anthea
I know where she is
Do you dear
said mother
Well I wouldnt take her back after the way she has behaved
Its not her fault said Anthea
May I tell you about it from the beginning
Mother laid down her pen and her nice face had a resigned expression
As you know a resigned expression always makes you want not to tell anybody anything
Its like this said Anthea in a hurry that egg you know that came in the carpet we put it in the fire and it hatched into the Phoenix and the carpet was a wishing carpetand A very nice game darling said mother taking up her pen
Now do be quiet
Ive got a lot of letters to write
Im going to Bournemouth tomorrow with the Lamband theres that bazaar
Anthea went back to x y z and mothers pen scratched busily
But mother said Anthea when mother put down the pen to lick an envelope the carpet takes us wherever we likeand I wish it would take you where you could get a few nice Eastern things for my bazaar said mother
I promised them and Ive no time to go to Libertys now
It shall said Anthea but mother Well dear said mother a little impatiently for she had taken up her pen again
The carpet took us to a place where you couldnt have whoopingcough and the Lamb hasnt whooped since and we took cook because she was so tiresome and then she would stay and be queen of the savages
They thought her cap was a crown and Darling one said mother you know I love to hear the things you make upbut I am most awfully busy
But its true said Anthea desperately
You shouldnt say that my sweet said mother gently
And then Anthea knew it was hopeless
Are you going away for long
asked Anthea
Ive got a cold said mother and daddys anxious about it and the Lambs cough
He hasnt coughed since Saturday the Lambs eldest sister interrupted
I wish I could think so mother replied
And daddys got to go to Scotland
I do hope youll be good children
We will we will said Anthea fervently
Whens the bazaar
On Saturday said mother at the schools
Oh dont talk any more theres a treasure
My heads going round and Ive forgotten how to spell whoopingcough
Mother and the Lamb went away and father went away and there was a new cook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had the heart to do anything to frighten her any more than seemed natural to her
The Phoenix begged to be excused
It said it wanted a weeks rest and asked that it might not be disturbed
And it hid its golden gleaming self and nobody could find it
So that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday and every one decided to go somewhere on the carpet the journey had to be undertaken without the Phoenix
They were debarred from any carpet excursions in the evening by a sudden promise to mother exacted in the agitation of parting that they would not be out after six at night except on Saturday when they were to go to the bazaar and were pledged to put on their best clothes to wash themselves to the uttermost and to clean their nailsnot with scissors which are scratchy and bad but with flatsharpened ends of wooden matches which do no harm to any ones nails
Lets go and see the Lamb said Jane
But every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in Bournemouth it would frighten mother out of her wits if not into a fit
So they sat on the carpet and thought and thought and thought till they almost began to squint
Look here said Cyril I know
Please carpet take us somewhere where we can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us
Except the Lamb said Jane quickly
And the next moment they found themselves recovering from the upsidedown movementand there they were sitting on the carpet and the carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown pineneedles
There were green pinetrees overhead and a swift clear little stream was running as fast as ever it could between steep banksand there sitting on the pineneedle carpet was mother without her hat and the sun was shining brightly although it was Novemberand there was the Lamb as jolly as jolly and not whooping at all
The carpets deceived us said Robert gloomily mother will see us directly she turns her head
But the faithful carpet had not deceived them
Mother turned her dear head and looked straight at them and DID NOT SEE THEM
Were invisible Cyril whispered what awful larks
But to the girls it was not larks at all
It was horrible to have mother looking straight at them and her face keeping the same just as though they werent there
I dont like it said Jane
Mother never looked at us like that before
Just as if she didnt love usas if we were somebody elses children and not very nice ones eitheras if she didnt care whether she saw us or not
It is horrid said Anthea almost in tears
But at this moment the Lamb saw them and plunged towards the carpet shrieking Panty own Pantyan Pussy an Squigglean Bobs oh oh
Anthea caught him and kissed him so did Jane they could not help ithe looked such a darling with his blue threecornered hat all on one side and his precious face all dirtyquite in the old familiar way
I love you Panty I love youand you and you and you cried the Lamb
It was a delicious moment
Even the boys thumped their baby brother joyously on the back
Then Anthea glanced at motherand mothers face was a pale seagreen colour and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought he had gone mad
And indeed that was exactly what she did think
My Lamb my precious
Come to mother she cried and jumped up and ran to the baby
She was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back or she would have felt them and to feel what you cant see is the worst sort of ghostfeeling
Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried away from the pinewood
Lets go home said Jane after a miserable silence
It feels just exactly as if mother didnt love us
But they couldnt bear to go home till they had seen mother meet another lady and knew that she was safe
You cannot leave your mother to go green in the face in a distant pinewood far from all human aid and then go home on your wishing carpet as though nothing had happened
When mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet and said Homeand home they went
I dont care about being invisible myself said Cyril at least not with my own family
It would be different if you were a prince or a bandit or a burglar
And now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish face of mother
I wish she hadnt gone away said Jane the house is simply beastly without her
I think we ought to do what she said Anthea put in
I saw something in a book the other day about the wishes of the departed being sacred
That means when theyve departed farther off said Cyril
Indias coral or Greenlands icy dont you know not Bournemouth
Besides we dont know what her wishes are
She SAIDAnthea was very much inclined to cryshe said Get Indian things for my bazaar but I know she thought we couldnt and it was only play
Lets get them all the same said Robert
Well go the first thing on Saturday morning
And on Saturday morning the first thing they went
There was no finding the Phoenix so they sat on the beautiful wishing carpet and said We want Indian things for mothers bazaar
Will you please take us where people will give us heaps of Indian things
The docile carpet swirled their senses away and restored them on the outskirts of a gleaming white Indian town
They knew it was Indian at once by the shape of the domes and roofs and besides a man went by on an elephant and two English soldiers went along the road talking like in Mr Kiplings booksso after that no one could have any doubt as to where they were
They rolled up the carpet and Robert carried it and they walked bodily into the town
It was very warm and once more they had to take off their LondoninNovember coats and carry them on their arms
The streets were narrow and strange and the clothes of the people in the streets were stranger and the talk of the people was strangest of all
I cant understand a word said Cyril
How on earth are we to ask for things for our bazaar
And theyre poor people too said Jane Im sure they are
What we want is a rajah or something
Robert was beginning to unroll the carpet but the others stopped him imploring him not to waste a wish
We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things for bazaars said Anthea and it will
Her faith was justified
Just as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban came up to them and bowed deeply
He spoke and they thrilled to the sound of English words
My ranee she think you very nice childs
She asks do you lose yourselves and do you desire to sell carpet
She see you from her palkee
You come see heryes
They followed the stranger who seemed to have a great many more teeth in his smile than are usual and he led them through crooked streets to the ranees palace
I am not going to describe the ranees palace because I really have never seen the palace of a ranee and Mr Kipling has
So you can read about it in his books
But I know exactly what happened there
The old ranee sat on a lowcushioned seat and there were a lot of other ladies with herall in trousers and veils and sparkling with tinsel and gold and jewels
And the brown turbaned gentleman stood behind a sort of carved screen and interpreted what the children said and what the queen said
And when the queen asked to buy the carpet the children said No
Why
asked the ranee
And Jane briefly said why and the interpreter interpreted
The queen spoke and then the interpreter said My mistress says it is a good story and you tell it all through without thought of time
And they had to
It made a long story especially as it had all to be told twiceonce by Cyril and once by the interpreter
Cyril rather enjoyed himself
He warmed to his work and told the tale of the Phoenix and the Carpet and the Lone Tower and the QueenCook in language that grew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy and the ranee and her ladies listened to the interpreter and rolled about on their fat cushions with laughter
When the story was ended she spoke and the interpreter explained that she had said Little one thou art a heavenborn teller of tales and she threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck
OH how lovely
cried Jane and Anthea
Cyril bowed several times and then cleared his throat and said Thank her very very much but I would much rather she gave me some of the cheap things in the bazaar
Tell her I want them to sell again and give the money to buy clothes for poor people who havent any
Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with its price said the queen when this was translated
But Cyril said very firmly No thank you
The things have got to be sold today at our bazaar and no one would buy a turquoise necklace at an English bazaar
Theyd think it was sham or else theyd want to know where we got it
So then the queen sent out for little pretty things and her servants piled the carpet with them
I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away she said laughing
But Anthea said If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash our hands and faces she shall see a magic thing
We and the carpet and all these brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things will just vanish away like smoke
The queen clapped her hands at this idea and lent the children a sandalwood comb inlaid with ivory lotusflowers
And they washed their faces and hands in silver basins
Then Cyril made a very polite farewell speech and quite suddenly he ended with the words And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools
And of course they were
And the queen and her ladies were left with their mouths open gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floor where the carpet and the children had been
That is magic if ever magic was
said the queen delighted with the incident which indeed has given the ladies of that court something to talk about on wet days ever since
Cyrils stories had taken some time so had the meal of strange sweet foods that they had had while the little pretty things were being bought and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted
Outside the winter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses
Im glad we got washed in India said Cyril
We should have been awfully late if wed had to go home and scrub
Besides Robert said its much warmer washing in India
I shouldnt mind it so much if we lived there
The thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space behind the point where the corners of two stalls met
The floor was littered with string and brown paper and baskets and boxes were heaped along the wall
The children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of tablecovers and mats and things embroidered beautifully by idle ladies with no real work to do
They got out at the end displacing a sideboardcloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums
The girls got out unobserved so did Cyril but Robert as he cautiously emerged was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle who kept the stall
Her large solid foot stood firmly on the small solid hand of Robert and who can blame Robert if he DID yell a little
A crowd instantly collected
Yells are very unusual at bazaars and every one was intensely interested
It was several seconds before the three free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what she was walking on was not a schoolroom floor or even as she presently supposed a dropped pincushion but the living hand of a suffering child
When she became aware that she really had hurt him she grew very angry indeed
When people have hurt other people by accident the one who does the hurting is always much the angriest
I wonder why
Im very sorry Im sure said Mrs Biddle but she spoke more in anger than in sorrow
Come out
whatever do you mean by creeping about under the stalls like earwigs
We were looking at the things in the corner
Such nasty prying ways said Mrs Biddle will never make you successful in life
Theres nothing there but packing and dust
Oh isnt there
said Jane
Thats all you know
Little girl dont be rude said Mrs Biddle flushing violet
She doesnt mean to be but there ARE some nice things there all the same said Cyril who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform the listening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mothers contributions to the bazaar
No one would believe it and if they did and wrote to thank mother she would thinkwell goodness only knew what she would think
The other three children felt the same
I should like to see them said a very nice lady whose friends had disappointed her and who hoped that these might be belated contributions to her poorly furnished stall
She looked inquiringly at Robert who said With pleasure dont mention it and dived back under Mrs Biddles stall
I wonder you encourage such behaviour said Mrs Biddle
I always speak my mind as you know Miss Peasmarsh and I must say I am surprised
She turned to the crowd
There is no entertainment here she said sternly
A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurt himself but only slightly
Will you please disperse
It will only encourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre of attraction
The crowd slowly dispersed
Anthea speechless with fury heard a nice curate say Poor little beggar
and loved the curate at once and for ever
Then Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brass and some inlaid sandalwood boxes
Liberty
cried Miss Peasmarsh
Then Charles has not forgotten after all
Excuse me said Mrs Biddle with fierce politeness these objects are deposited behind MY stall
Some unknown donor who does good by stealth and would blush if he could hear you claim the things
Of course they are for me
My stall touches yours at the corner said poor Miss Peasmarsh timidly and my cousin did promise The children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with the crowd
Their feelings were too deep for wordstill at last Robert said That stiffstarched PIG
And after all our trouble
Im hoarse with gassing to that trousered lady in India
The pigladys very very nasty said Jane
It was Anthea who said in a hurried undertone She isnt very nice and Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too
Whos got a pencil
it was a long crawl under three stalls but Anthea did it
A large piece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner
She folded it to a square and wrote upon it licking the pencil at every word to make it mark quite blackly All these Indian things are for pretty nice Miss Peasmarshs stall
She thought of adding There is nothing for Mrs Biddle but she saw that this might lead to suspicion so she wrote hastily From an unknown donna and crept back among the boards and trestles to join the others
So that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee and the corner of the stall was lifted and shifted so that stout clergymen and heavy ladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls the blue paper was discovered and all the splendid shining Indian things were given over to Miss Peasmarsh and she sold them all and got thirtyfive pounds for them
I dont understand about that blue paper said Mrs Biddle
It looks to me like the work of a lunatic
And saying you were nice and pretty
Its not the work of a sane person
Anthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell the things because it was their brother who had announced the good news that the things had come
Miss Peasmarsh was very willing for now her stall that had been SO neglected was surrounded by people who wanted to buy and she was glad to be helped
The children noted that Mrs Biddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could manage quite well
I hope they were not gladfor you should forgive your enemies even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all your naughty fault
But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to have been
It took some time to arrange the things on the stall
The carpet was spread over it and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver and ivory things
It was a happy and busy afternoon and when Miss Peasmarsh and the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things from the Indian bazaar far far away Anthea and Jane went off with the boys to fish in the fishpond and dive into the branpie and hear the cardboard band and the phonograph and the chorus of singing birds that was done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water
They had a beautiful tea suddenly presented to them by the nice curate and Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakes each
It was a merry party and the curate was extremely pleasant to every one even to Miss Peasmarsh as Jane said afterwards
We ought to get back to the stall said Anthea when no one could possibly eat any more and the curate was talking in a low voice to Miss Peas marsh about after Easter
Theres nothing to go back for said Miss Peasmarsh gaily thanks to you dear children weve sold everything
Theretheres the carpet said Cyril
Oh said Miss Peasmarsh radiantly dont bother about the carpet
Ive sold even that
Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it
She said it would do for her servants bedroom
Why said Jane her servants dont HAVE carpets
We had cook from her and she told us so
No scandal about Queen Elizabeth if YOU please said the curate cheerfully and Miss Peasmarsh laughed and looked at him as though she had never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing
But the others were struck dumb
How could they say The carpet is ours
For who brings carpets to bazaars
The children were now thoroughly wretched
But I am glad to say that their wretchedness did not make them forget their manners as it does sometimes even with grownup people who ought to know ever so much better
They said Thank you very much for the jolly tea and Thanks for being so jolly and Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time for the curate had stood fishponds and branpies and phonographs and the chorus of singing birds and had stood them like a man
The girls hugged Miss Peasmarsh and as they went away they heard the curate say Jolly little kids yes but what aboutyou will let it be directly after Easter
Ah do say you will And Jane ran back and said before Anthea could drag her away What are you going to do after Easter
Miss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed
And the curate said I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands
I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet said Jane
Thank you said the curate but Im afraid I cant wait for that
I must go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop
I should have no time afterwards
Ive always thought I should marry a bishop said Jane his aprons would come in so useful
Wouldnt YOU like to marry a bishop Miss Peasmarsh
It was then that they dragged her away
As it was Roberts hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on it was decided that he had better not recall the incident to her mind and so make her angry again
Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rival stall so they were not likely to be popular
A hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril less than she would hate the others so the others mingled with the crowd and it was he who said to her Mrs Biddle WE meant to have that carpet
Would you sell it to us
We would give you Certainly not said Mrs Biddle
Go away little boy
There was that in her tone which showed Cyril all too plainly the hopelessness of persuasion
He found the others and said Its no use shes like a lioness robbed of its puppies
We must watch where it goesand Anthea I dont care what you say
Its our own carpet
It wouldnt be burglary
It would be a sort of forlorn hope rescue partyheroic and daring and dashing and not wrong at all
The children still wandered among the gay crowdbut there was no pleasure there for them any more
The chorus of singing birds sounded just like glass tubes being blown through water and the phonograph simply made a horrid noise so that you could hardly hear yourself speak
And the people were buying things they couldnt possibly want and it all seemed very stupid
And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishing carpet for ten shillings
And the whole of life was sad and grey and dusty and smelt of slight gas escapes and hot people and cake and crumbs and all the children were very tired indeed
They found a corner within sight of the carpet and there they waited miserably till it was far beyond their proper bedtime
And when it was ten the people who had bought things went away but the people who had been selling stayed to count up their money
And to jaw about it said Robert
Ill never go to another bazaar as long as ever I live
My hand is swollen as big as a pudding
I expect the nails in her horrible boots were poisoned
Just then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said Everything is over now you had better go home
So they went
And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp where ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen to the band and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddle came out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadnt sold and the few things she had boughtamong others the carpet
The other stallholders left their things at the school till Monday morning but Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them so she took them in a cab
The children now too desperate to care for mud or appearances hung on behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddles house
When she and the carpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said Dont lets burgleI mean do daring and dashing rescue actstill weve given her a chance
Lets ring and ask to see her
The others hated to do this but at last they agreed on condition that Anthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards if it really had to come to that
So they knocked and rang and a scaredlooking parlourmaid opened the front door
While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her
She was in the diningroom and she had already pushed back the table and spread out the carpet to see how it looked on the floor
I knew she didnt want it for her servants bedroom Jane muttered
Anthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid and the others followed her
Mrs Biddle had her back to them and was smoothing down the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the hand of Robert
So that they were all in the room and Cyril with great presence of mind had shut the room door before she saw them
Who is it Jane
she asked in a sour voice and then turning suddenly she saw who it was
Once more her face grew violeta deep dark violet
You wicked daring little things
she cried how dare you come here
At this time of night too
Be off or Ill send for the police
Dont be angry said Anthea soothingly we only wanted to ask you to let us have the carpet
We have quite twelve shillings between us and How DARE you
cried Mrs Biddle and her voice shook with angriness
You do look horrid said Jane suddenly
Mrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers
You rude barefaced child
she said
Anthea almost shook Jane but Jane pushed forward in spite of her
It really IS our nursery carpet she said you ask ANY ONE if it isnt
Lets wish ourselves home said Cyril in a whisper
No go Robert whispered back shed be there too and raving mad as likely as not
Horrid thing I hate her
I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper cried Anthea suddenly
Its worth trying she said to herself
Mrs Biddles face grew from purple to violet and from violet to mauve and from mauve to pink
Then she smiled quite a jolly smile
Why so I am
she said what a funny idea
Why shouldnt I be in a good temper my dears
Once more the carpet had done its work and not on Mrs Biddle alone
The children felt suddenly good and happy
Youre a jolly good sort said Cyril
I see that now
Im sorry we vexed you at the bazaar today
Not another word said the changed Mrs Biddle
Of course you shall have the carpet my dears if youve taken such a fancy to it
No no I wont have more than the ten shillings I paid
It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar said Anthea but it really IS our nursery carpet
It got to the bazaar by mistake with some other things
Did it really now
How vexing
said Mrs Biddle kindly
Well my dears I can very well give the extra ten shillings so you take your carpet and well say no more about it
Have a piece of cake before you go
Im so sorry I stepped on your hand my boy
Is it all right now
Yes thank you said Robert
I say you ARE good
Not at all said Mrs Biddle heartily
Im delighted to be able to give any little pleasure to you dear children
And she helped them to roll up the carpet and the boys carried it away between them
You ARE a dear said Anthea and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each other heartily
WELL
said Cyril as they went along the street
Yes said Robert and the odd part is that you feel just as if it was REALher being so jolly I meanand not only the carpet making her nice
Perhaps it IS real said Anthea only it was covered up with crossness and tiredness and things and the carpet took them away
I hope itll keep them away said Jane she isnt ugly at all when she laughs
The carpet has done many wonders in its day but the case of Mrs Biddle is I think the most wonderful
For from that day she was never anything like so disagreeable as she was before and she sent a lovely silver teapot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when the pretty lady married the nice curate just after Easter it was and they went to Italy for their honeymoon
CHAPTER 5 THE TEMPLE I wish we could find the Phoenix said Jane
Its much better company than the carpet
Beastly ungrateful little kids are said Cyril
No Im not only the carpet never says anything and its so helpless
It doesnt seem able to take care of itself
It gets sold and taken into the sea and things like that
You wouldnt catch the Phoenix getting sold
It was two days after the bazaar
Every one was a little crosssome days are like that usually Mondays by the way
And this was a Monday
I shouldnt wonder if your precious Phoenix had gone off for good said Cyril and I dont know that I blame it
Look at the weather
Its not worth looking at said Robert
And indeed it wasnt
The Phoenix hasnt goneIm sure it hasnt said Anthea
Ill have another look for it
Anthea looked under tables and chairs and in boxes and baskets in mothers workbag and fathers portmanteau but still the Phoenix showed not so much as the tip of one shining feather
Then suddenly Robert remembered how the whole of the Greek invocation song of seven thousand lines had been condensed by him into one English hexameter so he stood on the carpet and chanted Oh come along come along you good old beautiful Phoenix and almost at once there was a rustle of wings down the kitchen stairs and the Phoenix sailed in on wide gold wings
Where on earth HAVE you been
asked Anthea
Ive looked everywhere for you
Not EVERYWHERE replied the bird because you did not look in the place where I was
Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by you
WHAT hallowed spot
asked Cyril a little impatiently for time was hastening on and the wishing carpet still idle
The spot said the Phoenix which I hallowed by my golden presence was the Lutron
The WHAT
The baththe place of washing
Im sure you werent said Jane
I looked there three times and moved all the towels
I was concealed said the Phoenix on the summit of a metal columnenchanted I should judge for it felt warm to my golden toes as though the glorious sun of the desert shone ever upon it
Oh you mean the cylinder said Cyril it HAS rather a comforting feel this weather
And now where shall we go
And then of course the usual discussion broke out as to where they should go and what they should do
And naturally every one wanted to do something that the others did not care about
I am the eldest Cyril remarked lets go to the North Pole
This weather
Likely
Robert rejoined
Lets go to the Equator
I think the diamond mines of Golconda would be nice said Anthea dont you agree Jane
No I dont retorted Jane I dont agree with you
I dont agree with anybody
The Phoenix raised a warning claw
If you cannot agree among yourselves I fear I shall have to leave you it said
Well where shall we go
You decide
said all
If I were you said the bird thoughtfully I should give the carpet a rest
Besides youll lose the use of your legs if you go everywhere by carpet
Cant you take me out and explain your ugly city to me
We will if it clears up said Robert without enthusiasm
Just look at the rain
And why should we give the carpet a rest
Are you greedy and grasping and heartless and selfish
asked the bird sharply
NO
said Robert with indignation
Well then
said the Phoenix
And as to the rainwell I am not fond of rain myself
If the sun knew I was herehes very fond of shining on me because I look so bright and golden
He always says I repay a little attention
Havent you some form of words suitable for use in wet weather
Theres Rain rain go away said Anthea but it never DOES go
Perhaps you dont say the invocation properly said the bird
Rain rain go away Come again another day Little baby wants to play said Anthea
Thats quite wrong and if you say it in that sort of dull way I can quite understand the rain not taking any notice
You should open the window and shout as loud as you can Rain rain go away Come again another day Now we want the sun and so Pretty rain be kind and go
You should always speak politely to people when you want them to do things and especially when its going away that you want them to do
And today you might add Shine great sun the lovely Phoe Nix is here and wants to be Shone on splendid sun by thee
Thats poetry
said Cyril decidedly
Its like it said the more cautious Robert
I was obliged to put in lovely said the Phoenix modestly to make the line long enough
There are plenty of nasty words just that length said Jane but every one else said Hush
And then they opened the window and shouted the seven lines as loud as they could and the Phoenix said all the words with them except lovely and when they came to that it looked down and coughed bashfully
The rain hesitated a moment and then went away
Theres true politeness said the Phoenix and the next moment it was perched on the windowledge opening and shutting its radiant wings and flapping out its golden feathers in such a flood of glorious sunshine as you sometimes have at sunset in autumn time
People said afterwards that there had not been such sunshine in December for years and years and years
And now said the bird we will go out into the city and you shall take me to see one of my temples
Your temples
I gather from the carpet that I have many temples in this land
I dont see how you CAN find anything out from it said Jane it never speaks
All the same you can pick up things from a carpet said the bird Ive seen YOU do it
And I have picked up several pieces of information in this way
That papyrus on which you showed me my pictureI understand that it bears on it the name of the street of your city in which my finest temple stands with my image graved in stone and in metal over against its portal
You mean the fire insurance office said Robert
Its not really a temple and they dont Excuse me said the Phoenix coldly you are wholly misinformed
It IS a temple and they do
Dont lets waste the sunshine said Anthea we might argue as we go along to save time
So the Phoenix consented to make itself a nest in the breast of Roberts Norfolk jacket and they all went out into the splendid sunshine
The best way to the temple of the Phoenix seemed to be to take the tram and on the top of it the children talked while the Phoenix now and then put out a wary beak cocked a cautious eye and contradicted what the children were saying
It was a delicious ride and the children felt how lucky they were to have had the money to pay for it
They went with the tram as far as it went and when it did not go any farther they stopped too and got off
The tram stops at the end of the Grays Inn Road and it was Cyril who thought that one might well find a short cut to the Phoenix Office through the little streets and courts that lie tightly packed between Fetter Lane and Ludgate Circus
Of course he was quite mistaken as Robert told him at the time and afterwards Robert did not forbear to remind his brother how he had said so
The streets there were small and stuffy and ugly and crowded with printers boys and binders girls coming out from work and these stared so hard at the pretty red coats and caps of the sisters that they wished they had gone some other way
And the printers and binders made very personal remarks advising Jane to get her hair cut and inquiring where Anthea had bought that hat
Jane and Anthea scorned to reply and Cyril and Robert found that they were hardly a match for the rough crowd
They could think of nothing nasty enough to say
They turned a corner sharply and then Anthea pulled Jane into an archway and then inside a door Cyril and Robert quickly followed and the jeering crowd passed by without seein them
Anthea drew a long breath
How awful
she said
I didnt know there were such people except in books
It was a bit thick but its partly you girls fault coming out in those flashy coats
We thought we ought to when we were going out with the Phoenix said Jane and the bird said Quite right tooand incautiously put out his head to give her a wink of encouragement
And at the same instant a dirty hand reached through the grim balustrade of the staircase beside them and clutched the Phoenix and a hoarse voice said I say Urb blowed if this aint our Poll parrot what we lost
Thank you very much lidy for bringin im home to roost
The four turned swiftly
Two large and ragged boys were crouched amid the dark shadows of the stairs
They were much larger than Robert and Cyril and one of them had snatched the Phoenix away and was holding it high above their heads
Give me that bird said Cyril sternly its ours
Good arternoon and thankin you the boy went on with maddening mockery
Sorry I cant give yer tuppence for yer troublebut Ive ad to spend my fortune advertising for my vallyable bird in all the newspapers
You can call for the reward next year
Look out Ike said his friend a little anxiously it ave a beak on it
Its other parties asll have the Beak on to em presently said Ike darkly if they come atrying to lay claims on my Poll parrot
You just shut up Urb
Now then you four little gells get out er this
Little girls
cried Robert
Ill little girl you
He sprang up three stairs and hit out
There was a squawkthe most birdlike noise any one had ever heard from the Phoenixand a fluttering and a laugh in the darkness and Ike said There now youve been and gone and strook my Poll parrot right in the fevversstrook im something crool you ave
Robert stamped with fury
Cyril felt himself growing pale with rage and with the effort of screwing up his brain to make it clever enough to think of some way of being even with those boys
Anthea and Jane were as angry as the boys but it made them want to cry
Yet it was Anthea who said Do PLEASE let us have the bird
Dew PLEASE get along and leave us an our bird alone
If you dont said Anthea I shall fetch the police
You better
said he who was named Urb
Say Ike you twist the bloomin pigeons neck he aint worth tuppence
Oh no cried Jane dont hurt it
Oh dont it is such a pet
I wont hurt it said Ike Im shamed of you Urb for to think of such a thing
Arf a shiner miss and the bird is yours for life
Half a WHAT
asked Anthea
Arf a shiner quid thick unhalf a sov then
I havent got itand besides its OUR bird said Anthea
Oh dont talk to him said Cyril and then Jane said suddenly Phoenixdear Phoenix we cant do anything
YOU must manage it
With pleasure said the Phoenixand Ike nearly dropped it in his amazement
I say it do talk suthin like said he
Youths said the Phoenix sons of misfortune hear my words
My eyes
said Ike
Look out Ike said Urb youll throttle the jokerand I see at wunst e was wuth is weight in flimsies
00 Hearken O Eikonoclastes despiser of sacred imagesand thou Urbanus dweller in the sordid city
Forbear this adventure lest a worse thing befall
Luv us
said Ike aint it been taught its schoolin just
Restore me to my young acolytes and escape unscathed
Retain meand They must ha got all this up case the Polly got pinched said Ike
Lor lumme the artfulness of them young uns
I say slosh em in the geseech and get clear off with the swags wot I say urged Herbert
Right O said Isaac
Forbear repeated the Phoenix sternly
Who pinched the click off of the old bloke in Aldermanbury
it added in a changed tone
Who sneaked the noserag out of the young gells and in Bell Court
Who Stow it said Ike
You
ugh
yahleave go of me
Bash him off Urb ell have my bloomin eyes outer my ed
There were howls a scuffle a flutter Ike and Urb fled up the stairs and the Phoenix swept out through the doorway
The children followed and the Phoenix settled on Robert like a butterfly on a rose as Anthea said afterwards and wriggled into the breast of his Norfolk jacket like an eel into mud as Cyril later said
Why ever didnt you burn him
You could have couldnt you
asked Robert when the hurried flight through the narrow courts had ended in the safe wideness of Farringdon Street
I could have of course said the bird but I didnt think it would be dignified to allow myself to get warm about a little thing like that
The Fates after all have not been illiberal to me
I have a good many friends among the London sparrows and I have a beak and claws
These happenings had somewhat shaken the adventurous temper of the children and the Phoenix had to exert its golden self to hearten them up
Presently the children came to a great house in Lombard Street and there on each side of the door was the image of the Phoenix carved in stone and set forth on shining brass were the words PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE One moment said the bird
Fire
For altars I suppose
I dont know said Robert he was beginning to feel shy and that always made him rather cross
Oh yes you do Cyril contradicted
When peoples houses are burnt down the Phoenix gives them new houses
Father told me I asked him
The house then like the Phoenix rises from its ashes
Well have my priests dealt with the sons of men
The sons of men pay you know said Anthea but its only a little every year
That is to maintain my priests said the bird who in the hour of affliction heal sorrows and rebuild houses
Lead on inquire for the High Priest
I will not break upon them too suddenly in all my glory
Noble and honourdeserving are they who make as nought the evil deeds of the lamefooted and unpleasing Hephaestus
I dont know what youre talking about and I wish you wouldnt muddle us with new names
Fire just happens
Nobody does itnot as a deed you know Cyril explained
If they did the Phoenix wouldnt help them because its a crime to set fire to things
Arsenic or something they call it because its as bad as poisoning people
The Phoenix wouldnt help THEMfather told me it wouldnt
My priests do well said the Phoenix
Lead on
I dont know what to say said Cyril and the Others said the same
Ask for the High Priest said the Phoenix
Say that you have a secret to unfold that concerns my worship and he will lead you to the innermost sanctuary
So the children went in all four of them though they didnt like it and stood in a large and beautiful hall adorned with Doulton tiles like a large and beautiful bath with no water in it and stately pillars supporting the roof
An unpleasing representation of the Phoenix in brown pottery disfigured one wall
There were counters and desks of mahogany and brass and clerks bent over the desks and walked behind the counters
There was a great clock over an inner doorway
Inquire for the High Priest whispered the Phoenix
An attentive clerk in decent black who controlled his mouth but not his eyebrows now came towards them
He leaned forward on the counter and the children thought he was going to say What can I have the pleasure of showing you
like in a drapers instead of which the young man said And what do YOU want
We want to see the High Priest
Get along with you said the young man
An elder man also decent in black coat advanced
Perhaps its Mr Blank not for worlds would I give the name
Hes a Masonic High Priest you know
A porter was sent away to look for Mr Asterisk I cannot give his name and the children were left there to look on and be looked on by all the gentlemen at the mahogany desks
Anthea and Jane thought that they looked kind
The boys thought they stared and that it was like their cheek
The porter returned with the news that Mr Dot Dash Dot I dare not reveal his name was out but that Mr Here a really delightful gentleman appeared
He had a beard and a kind and merry eye and each one of the four knew at once that this was a man who had kiddies of his own and could understand what you were talking about
Yet it was a difficult thing to explain
What is it
he asked
Mrhe named the name which I will never revealis out
Can I do anything
Inner sanctuary murmured the Phoenix
I beg your pardon said the nice gentleman who thought it was Robert who had spoken
We have something to tell you said Cyril buthe glanced at the porter who was lingering much nearer than he need have donethis is a very public place
The nice gentleman laughed
Come upstairs then he said and led the way up a wide and beautiful staircase
Anthea says the stairs were of white marble but I am not sure
On the cornerpost of the stairs at the top was a beautiful image of the Phoenix in dark metal and on the wall at each side was a flat sort of image of it
The nice gentleman led them into a room where the chairs and even the tables were covered with reddish leather
He looked at the children inquiringly
Dont be frightened he said tell me exactly what you want
May I shut the door
asked Cyril
The gentleman looked surprised but he shut the door
Now said Cyril firmly I know youll be awfully surprised and youll think its not true and we are lunatics but we arent and it is
Roberts got something inside his Norfolkthats Robert hes my young brother
Now dont be upset and have a fit or anything sir
Of course I know when you called your shop the Phoenix you never thought there was one but there isand Roberts got it buttoned up against his chest
If its an old curio in the form of a Phoenix I dare say the Board said the nice gentleman as Robert began to fumble with his buttons
Its old enough said Anthea going by what it says but My goodness gracious
said the gentleman as the Phoenix with one last wriggle that melted into a flutter got out of its nest in the breast of Robert and stood up on the leathercovered table
What an extraordinarily fine bird
he went on
I dont think I ever saw one just like it
I should think not said the Phoenix with pardonable pride
And the gentleman jumped
Oh its been taught to speak
Some sort of parrot perhaps
I am said the bird simply the Head of your House and I have come to my temple to receive your homage
I am no parrotits beak curved scornfullyI am the one and only Phoenix and I demand the homage of my High Priest
In the absence of our manager the gentleman began exactly as though he were addressing a valued customerin the absence of our manager I might perhaps be ableWhat am I saying
He turned pale and passed his hand across his brow
My dears he said the weather is unusually warm for the time of year and I dont feel quite myself
Do you know for a moment I really thought that that remarkable bird of yours had spoken and said it was the Phoenix and whats more that Id believed it
So it did sir said Cyril and so did you
It reallyAllow me
A bell was rung
The porter appeared
Mackenzie said the gentleman you see that golden bird
Yes sir
The other breathed a sigh of relief
It IS real then
Yes sir of course sir
You take it in your hand sir said the porter sympathetically and reached out his hand to the Phoenix who shrank back on toes curved with agitated indignation
Forbear
it cried how dare you seek to lay hands on me
The porter saluted
Beg pardon sir he said I thought you was a bird
I AM a birdTHE birdthe Phoenix
Of course you are sir said the porter
I see that the first minute directly I got my breath sir
That will do said the gentleman
Ask Mr Wilson and Mr Sterry to step up here for a moment please
Mr Sterry and Mr Wilson were in their turn overcome by amazementquickly followed by conviction
To the surprise of the children every one in the office took the Phoenix at its word and after the first shock of surprise it seemed to be perfectly natural to every one that the Phoenix should be alive and that passing through London it should call at its temple
We ought to have some sort of ceremony said the nicest gentleman anxiously
There isnt time to summon the directors and shareholderswe might do that tomorrow perhaps
Yes the boardroom would be best
I shouldnt like it to feel we hadnt done everything in our power to show our appreciation of its condescension in looking in on us in this friendly way
The children could hardly believe their ears for they had never thought that any one but themselves would believe in the Phoenix
And yet every one did all the men in the office were brought in by twos and threes and the moment the Phoenix opened its beak it convinced the cleverest of them as well as those who were not so clever
Cyril wondered how the story would look in the papers next day
He seemed to see the posters in the streets PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE THE PHOENIX AT ITS TEMPLE MEETING TO WELCOME IT DELIGHT OF THE MANAGER AND EVERYBODY
Excuse our leaving you a moment said the nice gentleman and he went away with the others and through the halfclosed door the children could hear the sound of many boots on stairs the hum of excited voices explaining suggesting arguing the thumpy drag of heavy furniture being moved about
The Phoenix strutted up and down the leathercovered table looking over its shoulder at its pretty back
You see what a convincing manner I have it said proudly
And now a new gentleman came in and said bowing low Everything is preparedwe have done our best at so short a notice the meetingthe ceremonywill be in the boardroom
Will the Honourable Phoenix walkit is only a few stepsor would it like to bewould it like some sort of conveyance
My Robert will bear me to the boardroom if that be the unlovely name of my temples inmost court replied the bird
So they all followed the gentleman
There was a big table in the boardroom but it had been pushed right up under the long windows at one side and chairs were arranged in rows across the roomlike those you have at schools when there is a magic lantern on Our Eastern Empire or on The Way We Do in the Navy
The doors were of carved wood very beautiful with a carved Phoenix above
Anthea noticed that the chairs in the front rows were of the kind that her mother so loved to ask the price of in old furniture shops and never could buy because the price was always nearly twenty pounds each
On the mantelpiece were some heavy bronze candlesticks and a clock and on the top of the clock was another image of the Phoenix
Remove that effigy said the Phoenix to the gentlemen who were there and it was hastily taken down
Then the Phoenix fluttered to the middle of the mantelpiece and stood there looking more golden than ever
Then every one in the house and the office came infrom the cashier to the women who cooked the clerks dinners in the beautiful kitchen at the top of the house
And every one bowed to the Phoenix and then sat down in a chair
Gentlemen said the nicest gentleman we have met here today The Phoenix was turning its golden beak from side to side
I dont notice any incense it said with an injured sniff
A hurried consultation ended in plates being fetched from the kitchen
Brown sugar sealingwax and tobacco were placed on these and something from a square bottle was poured over it all
Then a match was applied
It was the only incense that was handy in the Phoenix office and it certainly burned very briskly and smoked a great deal
We have met here today said the gentleman again on an occasion unparalleled in the annals of this office
Our respected Phoenix Head of the House said the Phoenix in a hollow voice
I was coming to that
Our respected Phoenix the Head of this ancient House has at length done us the honour to come among us
I think I may say gentlemen that we are not insensible to this honour and that we welcome with no uncertain voice one whom we have so long desired to see in our midst
Several of the younger clerks thought of saying Hear hear but they feared it might seem disrespectful to the bird
I will not take up your time the speaker went on by recapitulating the advantages to be derived from a proper use of our system of fire insurance
I know and you know gentlemen that our aim has ever been to be worthy of that eminent bird whose name we bear and who now adorns our mantelpiece with his presence
Three cheers gentlemen for the winged Head of the House
The cheers rose deafening
When they had died away the Phoenix was asked to say a few words
It expressed in graceful phrases the pleasure it felt in finding itself at last in its own temple
And it went on You must not think me wanting in appreciation of your very hearty and cordial reception when I ask that an ode may be recited or a choric song sung
It is what I have always been accustomed to
The four children dumb witnesses of this wonderful scene glanced a little nervously across the foam of white faces above the sea of black coats
It seemed to them that the Phoenix was really asking a little too much
Time presses said the Phoenix and the original ode of invocation is long as well as being Greek and besides its no use invoking me when here I am but is there not a song in your own tongue for a great day such as this
Absently the manager began to sing and one by one the rest joined Absolute security
No liability
All kinds of property insured against fire
Terms most favourable Expenses reasonable Moderate rates for annual Insurance
That one is NOT my favourite interrupted the Phoenix and I think youve forgotten part of it
The manager hastily began another O Golden Phoenix fairest bird The whole great world has often heard Of all the splendid things we do Great Phoenix just to honour you
Thats better said the bird
And every one sang Class one for private dwellinghouse For household goods and shops allows Provided these are built of brick Or stone and tiled and slated thick
Try another verse said the Phoenix further on
And again arose the voices of all the clerks and employees and managers and secretaries and cooks In Scotland our insurance yields The price of burntup stacks in fields
Skip that verse said the Phoenix
Thatched dwellings and their whole contents We deal withalso with their rents Oh glorious Phoenix look and see That these are dealt with in class three
The glories of your temple throng Too thick to go in any song And we attend O good and wise To days of grace and merchandise
When peoples homes are burned away They never have a cent to pay If they have done as all should do O Phoenix and have honoured you
So let us raise our voice and sing The praises of the Phoenix King
In classes one and two and three Oh trust to him for kind is he
Im sure YOURE very kind said the Phoenix and now we must be going
An thank you very much for a very pleasant time
May you all prosper as you deserve to do for I am sure a nicer pleasanterspoken lot of temple attendants I have never met and never wish to meet
I wish you all goodday
It fluttered to the wrist of Robert and drew the four children from the room
The whole of the office staff followed down the wide stairs and filed into their accustomed places and the two most important officials stood on the steps bowing till Robert had buttoned the golden bird in his Norfolk bosom and it and he and the three other children were lost in the crowd
The two most important gentlemen looked at each other earnestly and strangely for a moment and then retreated to those sacred inner rooms where they toil without ceasing for the good of the House
And the moment they were all in their placesmanagers secretaries clerks and portersthey all started and each looked cautiously round to see if any one was looking at him
For each thought that he had fallen asleep for a few minutes and had dreamed a very odd dream about the Phoenix and the boardroom
And of course no one mentioned it to any one else because going to sleep at your office is a thing you simply MUST NOT do
The extraordinary confusion of the boardroom with the remains of the incense in the plates would have shown them at once that the visit of the Phoenix had been no dream but a radiant reality but no one went into the boardroom again that day and next day before the office was opened it was all cleaned and put nice and tidy by a lady whose business asking questions was not part of
That is why Cyril read the papers in vain on the next day and the day after that because no sensible person thinks his dreams worth putting in the paper and no one will ever own that he has been asleep in the daytime
The Phoenix was very pleased but it decided to write an ode for itself
It thought the ones it had heard at its temple had been too hastily composed
Its own ode began For beauty and for modest worth The Phoenix has not its equal on earth
And when the children went to bed that night it was still trying to cut down the last line to the proper length without taking out any of what it wanted to say
That is what makes poetry so difficult
CHAPTER 6 DOING GOOD We shant be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week though said Robert
And Im glad of it said Jane unexpectedly
Glad
said Cyril GLAD
It was breakfasttime and mothers letter telling them how they were all going for Christmas to their aunts at Lyndhurst and how father and mother would meet them there having been read by every one lay on the table drinking hot baconfat with one corner and eating marmalade with the other
Yes glad said Jane
I dont want any more things to happen just now
I feel like you do when youve been to three parties in a weeklike we did at grannys onceand extras in between toys and chocs and things like that
I want everything to be just real and no fancy things happening at all
I dont like being obliged to keep things from mother said Anthea
I dont know why but it makes me feel selfish and mean
If we could only get the mater to believe it we might take her to the jolliest places said Cyril thoughtfully
As it is weve just got to be selfish and meanif it is thatbut I dont feel it is
I KNOW it isnt but I FEEL it is said Anthea and thats just as bad
Its worse said Robert if you knew it and didnt feel it it wouldnt matter so much
Thats being a hardened criminal father says put in Cyril and he picked up mothers letter and wiped its corners with his handkerchief to whose colour a trifle of baconfat and marmalade made but little difference
Were going tomorrow anyhow said Robert
Dont he added with a goodboy expression on his facedont lets be ungrateful for our blessings dont lets waste the day in saying how horrid it is to keep secrets from mother when we all know Anthea tried all she knew to give her the secret and she wouldnt take it
Lets get on the carpet and have a jolly good wish
Youll have time enough to repent of things all next week
Yes said Cyril lets
Its not really wrong
Well look here said Anthea
You know theres something about Christmas that makes you want to be goodhowever little you wish it at other times
Couldnt we wish the carpet to take us somewhere where we should have the chance to do some good and kind action
It would be an adventure just the same she pleaded
I dont mind said Cyril
We shant know where were going and thatll be exciting
No one knows whatll happen
Wed best put on our outers in case We might rescue a traveller buried in the snow like St Bernard dogs with barrels round our necks said Jane beginning to be interested
Or we might arrive just in time to witness a will being signedmore tea please said Robert and we should see the old man hide it away in the secret cupboard and then after long years when the rightful heir was in despair we should lead him to the hidden panel and Yes interrupted Anthea or we might be taken to some freezing garret in a German town where a poor little pale sick child We havent any German money interrupted Cyril so THATS no go
What I should like would be getting into the middle of a war and getting hold of secret intelligence and taking it to the general and he would make me a lieutenant or a scout or a hussar
When breakfast was cleared away Anthea swept the carpet and the children sat down on it together with the Phoenix who had been especially invited as a Christmas treat to come with them and witness the good and kind action they were about to do
Four children and one bird were ready and the wish was wished
Every one closed its eyes so as to feel the topsyturvy swirl of the carpets movement as little as possible
When the eyes were opened again the children found themselves on the carpet and the carpet was in its proper place on the floor of their own nursery at Camden Town
I say said Cyril heres a go
Do you think its worn out
The wishing part of it I mean
Robert anxiously asked the Phoenix
Its not that said the Phoenix butwellwhat did you wish
Oh
I see what it means said Robert with deep disgust its like the end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine
How perfectly beastly
You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are
I see
I suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make clothes for the bare heathens
Well I simply wont
And the last day and everything
Look here
Cyril spoke loudly and firmly
We want to go somewhere really interesting where we have a chance of doing something good and kind we dont want to do it here but somewhere else
See
Now then
The obedient carpet started instantly and the four children and one bird fell in a heap together and as they fell were plunged in perfect darkness
Are you all there
said Anthea breathlessly through the black dark
Every one owned that it was there
Where are we
Oh
how shivery and wet it is
UghohIve put my hand in a puddle
Has any one got any matches
said Anthea hopelessly
She felt sure that no one would have any
It was then that Robert with a radiant smile of triumph that was quite wasted in the darkness where of course no one could see anything drew out of his pocket a box of matches struck a match and lighted a candletwo candles
And every one with its mouth open blinked at the sudden light
Well done Bobs said his sisters and even Cyrils natural brotherly feelings could not check his admiration of Roberts foresight
Ive always carried them about ever since the lone tower day said Robert with modest pride
I knew we should want them some day
I kept the secret well didnt I
Oh yes said Cyril with fine scorn
I found them the Sunday after when I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you borrowed off me
But I thought youd only sneaked them for Chinese lanterns or reading in bed by
Bobs said Anthea suddenly do you know where we are
This is the underground passage and look theretheres the money and the moneybags and everything
By this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles and no one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth
It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in though said Jane
Theres no one to do them to
Dont you be too sure said Cyril just round the next turning we might find a prisoner who has languished here for years and years and we could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowing friends
Of course we could said Robert standing up and holding the candle above his head to see further off or we might find the bones of a poor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properlythats always a kind action in books though I never could see what bones matter
I wish you wouldnt said Jane
I know exactly where we shall find the bones too Robert went on
You see that dark arch just along the passage
Well just inside there If you dont stop going on like that said Jane firmly I shall scream and then Ill faintso now then
And I will too said Anthea
Robert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy
You girls will never be great writers he said bitterly
They just love to think of things in dungeons and chains and knobbly bare human bones and Jane had opened her mouth to scream but before she could decide how you began when you wanted to faint the golden voice of the Phoenix spoke through the gloom
Peace
it said there are no bones here except the small but useful sets that you have inside you
And you did not invite me to come out with you to hear you talk about bones but to see you do some good and kind action
We cant do it here said Robert sulkily
No rejoined the bird
The only thing we can do here it seems is to try to frighten our little sisters
He didnt really and Im not so VERY little said Jane rather ungratefully
Robert was silent
It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they had better take the money and go
That wouldnt be a kind act except to ourselves and it wouldnt be good whatever way you look at it said Anthea to take money thats not ours
We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged said Cyril
That wouldnt make it right to steal said Anthea stoutly
I dont know said Cyril
They were all standing up now
Stealing is taking things that belong to some one else and theres no one else
It cant be stealing if Thats right said Robert with ironical approval stand here all day arguing while the candles burn out
Youll like it awfully when its all dark againand bony
Lets get out then said Anthea
We can argue as we go
So they rolled up the carpet and went
But when they had crept along to the place where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way blocked by a great stone which they could not move
There
said Robert
I hope youre satisfied
Everything has two ends said the Phoenix softly even a quarrel or a secret passage
So they turned round and went back and Robert was made to go first with one of the candles because he was the one who had begun to talk about bones
And Cyril carried the carpet
I wish you hadnt put bones into our heads said Jane as they went along
I didnt you always had them
More bones than brains said Robert
The passage was long and there were arches and steps and turnings and dark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing
The passage ended in a flight of steps
Robert went up them
Suddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane and everybody screamed Oh
what is it
Ive only bashed my head in said Robert when he had groaned for some time thats all
Dont mention it I like it
The stairs just go right slap into the ceiling and its a stone ceiling
You cant do good and kind actions underneath a pavingstone
Stairs arent made to lead just to pavingstones as a general rule said the Phoenix
Put your shoulder to the wheel
There isnt any wheel said the injured Robert still rubbing his head
But Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair and was already shoving his hardest against the stone above
Of course it did not give in the least
If its a trapdoor said Cyril
And he stopped shoving and began to feel about with his hands
Yes there is a bolt
I cant move it
By a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oilcan of his fathers bicycle he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs and he lay on his back with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down among his young relations and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust and oil fell down on his face
One even went into his mouthopen as he panted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position
Then he tried again but still the bolt would not move
So now he tied his handkerchiefthe one with the baconfat and marmalade on itto the bolt and Roberts handkerchief to that in a reef knot which cannot come undone however much you pull and indeed gets tighter and tighter the more you pull it
This must not be confused with a granny knot which comes undone if you look at it
And then he and Robert pulled and the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too and suddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch and they all rolled together to the bottom of the stairsall but the Phoenix which had taken to its wings when the pulling began
Nobody was hurt much because the rolledup carpet broke their fall and now indeed the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose for the stone allowed them to heave it up
They felt it give dust fell freely on them
Now then cried Robert forgetting his head and his temper push all together
One two three
The stone was heaved up
It swung up on a creaking unwilling hinge and showed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight and it fell back with a bang against something that kept it upright
Every one climbed out but there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the little paved house where they found themselves so when the Phoenix had fluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down and it closed like a trapdoor as indeed it was
You can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were
Fortunately there was no one to see them but each other
The place they were in was a little shrine built on the side of a road that went winding up through yellowgreen fields to the topless tower
Below them were fields and orchards all bare boughs and brown furrows and little houses and gardens
The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front walljust a place for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good
So the Phoenix told them
There was an image that had once been brightly coloured but the rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine and the poor image was dull and weatherstained
Under it was written St Jean de Luz
Priez pour nous
It was a sad little place very neglected and lonely and yet it was nice Anthea thought that poor travellers should come to this little resthouse in the hurry and worry of their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes and think about being good
The thought of St Jean de Luzwho had no doubt in his time been very good and kindmade Anthea want more than ever to do something kind and good
Tell us she said to the Phoenix what is the good and kind action the carpet brought us here to do
I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tell them about it said Cyril
And give it them ALL
said Jane
Yes
But whose is it
I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of the castle said the golden bird and really the idea seemed a good one
They dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road
A little way on they found a tiny spring bubbling out of the hillside and falling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hartstongue ferns now hardly green at all
Here the children washed their hands and faces and dried them on their pockethandkerchiefs which always on these occasions seem unnaturally small
Cyrils and Roberts handkerchiefs indeed rather undid the effects of the wash
But in spite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before
The first house they came to was a little white house with green shutters and a slate roof
It stood in a prim little garden and down each side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to grow in but all the flowers were dead now
Along one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda built of poles and trelliswork and a vine crawled all over it
It was wider than our English verandas and Anthea thought it must look lovely when the green leaves and the grapes were there but now there were only dry reddishbrown stalks and stems with a few withered leaves caught in them
The children walked up to the front door
It was green and narrow
A chain with a handle hung beside it and joined itself quite openly to a rusty bell that hung under the porch
Cyril had pulled the bell and its noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all
Cyril spoke it
My hat
he breathed
We dont know any French
At this moment the door opened
A very tall lean lady with pale ringlets like whiteybrown paper or oak shavings stood before them
She had an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron
Her eyes were small and grey and not pretty and the rims were red as though she had been crying
She addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign language and ended with something which they were sure was a question
Of course no one could answer it
What does she say
Robert asked looking down into the hollow of his jacket where the Phoenix was nestling
But before the Phoenix could answer the whiteybrown ladys face was lighted up by a most charming smile
Youyou arrre frrrom the England
she cried
I love so much the England
Mais entrezentrez donc tous
Enter thenenter all
One essuyes his feet on the carpet
She pointed to the mat
We only wanted to ask I shall say you all that what you wish said the lady
Enter only
So they all went in wiping their feet on a very clean mat and putting the carpet in a safe corner of the veranda
The most beautiful days of my life said the lady as she shut the door did pass themselves in England
And since long time I have not heard an English voice to repeal me the past
This warm welcome embarrassed every one but most the boys for the floor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles and the floor of the sittingroom so very shinylike a black lookingglassthat each felt as though he had on far more boots than usual and far noisier
There was a wood fire very small and very bright on the hearthneat little logs laid on brass firedogs
Some portraits of powdered ladies and gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls
There were silver candlesticks on the mantelpiece and there were chairs and a table very slim and polite with slender legs
The room was extremely bare but with a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful in an odd way of its own
At the end of the polished table a very unEnglish little boy sat on a footstool in a highbacked uncomfortablelooking chair
He wore black velvet and the kind of collarall frills and lacey that Robert would rather have died than wear but then the little French boy was much younger than Robert
Oh how pretty
said every one
But no one meant the little French boy with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair
What every one admired was a little little Christmastree very green and standing in a very red little flowerpot and hung round with very bright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper
There were tiny candles on the tree but they were not lighted yet
But yesis it not that it is genteel
said the lady
Sit down you then and let us see
The children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall and the lady lighted a long slim red taper at the wood flame and then she drew the curtains and lit the little candles and when they were all lighted the little French boy suddenly shouted Bravo ma tante
Oh que cest gentil and the English children shouted Hooray
Then there was a struggle in the breast of Robert and out fluttered the Phoenixspread his gold wings flew to the top of the Christmastree and perched there
Ah
catch it then cried the lady it will itself burnyour genteel parrakeet
It wont said Robert thank you
And the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands but the lady was so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down on the shiny walnutwood table
Is it that it talks
asked the lady
And the Phoenix replied in excellent French
It said Parfaitement madame
Oh the pretty parrakeet said the lady
Can it say still of other things
And the Phoenix replied this time in English Why are you sad so near Christmastime
The children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise for the youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice that strangers have been crying and much worse to ask them the reason of their tears
And of course the lady began to cry again very much indeed after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart and she could not find her handkerchief so Anthea offered hers which was still very damp and no use at all
She also hugged the lady and this seemed to be of more use than the handkerchief so that presently the lady stopped crying and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes and called Anthea a cherished angel
I am sorry we came just when you were so sad said Anthea but we really only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill
Oh my little angel said the poor lady sniffing today and for hundreds of years the castle is to us to our family
Tomorrow it must that I sell it to some strangersand my little Henri who ignores all he will not have never the lands paternal
But what will you
His father my brotherMr the Marquishas spent much of money and it the must despite the sentiments of familial respect that I admit that my sainted father he also How would you feel if you found a lot of moneyhundreds and thousands of gold pieces
asked Cyril
The lady smiled sadly
Ah
one has already recounted to you the legend
she said
It is true that one says that it is long time oh
but long time one of our ancestors has hid a treasureof gold and of gold and of goldenough to enrich my little Henri for the life
But all that my children it is but the accounts of fays She means fairy stories whispered the Phoenix to Robert
Tell her what you have found
So Robert told while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she should faint for joy like people in books and they hugged her with the earnest joyous hugs of unselfish delight
Its no use explaining how we got in said Robert when he had told of the finding of the treasure because you would find it a little difficult to understand and much more difficult to believe
But we can show you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away
The lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugs of the girls
No hes not making it up said Anthea its true TRUE TRUEand we are so glad
You would not be capable to torment an old woman
she said and it is not possible that it be a dream
It really IS true said Cyril and I congratulate you very much
His tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the raptures of the others
If I do not dream she said Henri come to Manonand youyou shall come all with me to Mr the Curate
Is it not
Manon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief twisted round her head
She took Henri who was already sleepy with the excitement of his Christmastree and his visitors and when the lady had put on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pair of black wooden clogs over her black cashmere houseboots the whole party went down the road to a little white housevery like the one they had leftwhere an old priest with a good face welcomed them with a politeness so great that it hid his astonishment
The lady with her French waving hands and her shrugging French shoulders and her trembling French speech told the story
And now the priest who knew no English shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS hands and spoke also in French
He thinks whispered the Phoenix that her troubles have turned her brain
What a pity you know no French
I do know a lot of French whispered Robert indignantly but its all about the pencil of the gardeners son and the penknife of the bakers niecenothing that anyone ever wants to say
If I speak the bird whispered hell think HES mad too
Tell me what to say
Say Cest vrai monsieur
Venez donc voir said the Phoenix and then Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying very loudly and distinctly Say vray mossoo venny dong vwaw
The priest was disappointed when he found that Roberts French began and ended with these useful words but at any rate he saw that if the lady was mad she was not the only one and he put on a big beavery hat and got a candle and matches and a spade and they all went up the hill to the wayside shrine of St John of Luz
Now said Robert I will go first and show you where it is
So they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade and Robert did go first and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly as they had left it
And every one was flushed with the joy of performing such a wonderfully kind action
Then the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy as French people do and knelt down and touched the money and talked very fast and both together and the lady embraced all the children three times each and called them little garden angels and then she and the priest shook each other by both hands again and talked and talked and talked faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible
And the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure
Get away NOW said the Phoenix softly breaking in on the radiant dream
So the children crept away and out through the little shrine and the lady and the priest were so tearfully talkatively happy that they never noticed that the guardian angels had gone
The garden angels ran down the hill to the ladys little house where they had left the carpet on the veranda and they spread it out and said Home and no one saw them disappear except little Henri who had flattened his nose into a white button against the windowglass and when he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming
So that was all right
It is much the best thing weve done said Anthea when they talked it over at teatime
In the future well only do kind actions with the carpet
Ahem
said the Phoenix
I beg your pardon
said Anthea
Oh nothing said the bird
I was only thinking
CHAPTER 7 MEWS FROM PERSIA When you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo Station quite untakencareof and with no one to meet them it may make you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful
But if you think this you will be wrong
The fact is mother arranged with Aunt Emma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo when they went back from their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst
The train was fixed but not the day
Then mother wrote to Aunt Emma giving her careful instructions about the day and the hour and about luggage and cabs and things and gave the letter to Robert to post
But the hounds happened to meet near Rufus Stone that morning and what is more on the way to the meet they met Robert and Robert met them and instantly forgot all about posting Aunt Emmas letter and never thought of it again until he and the others had wandered three times up and down the platform at Waterloowhich makes six in alland had bumped against old gentlemen and stared in the faces of ladies and been shoved by people in a hurry and byyourleaved by porters with trucks and were quite quite sure that Aunt Emma was not there
Then suddenly the true truth of what he had forgotten to do came home to Robert and he said Oh crikey
and stood still with his mouth open and let a porter with a Gladstone bag in each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily into him and never so much as said Where are you shoving to now
or Look out where youre going cant you
The heavier bag smote him at the knee and he staggered but he said nothing
When the others understood what was the matter I think they told Robert what they thought of him
We must take the train to Croydon said Anthea and find Aunt Emma
Yes said Cyril and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to see us and our traps
Aunt Emma indeed was staying with some Jevonsesvery prim people
They were middleaged and wore very smart blouses and they were fond of matinees and shopping and they did not care about children
I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back said Jane
Yes she would but shed think it was not right to show she was pleased because its Bobs fault were not met
Dont I know the sort of thing
said Cyril
Besides weve no tin
No weve got enough for a growler among us but not enough for tickets to the New Forest
We must just go home
They wont be so savage when they find weve really got home all right
You know auntie was only going to take us home in a cab
I believe we ought to go to Croydon Anthea insisted
Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert said Robert
Those Jevonses go to the theatre every afternoon I believe
Besides theres the Phoenix at home AND the carpet
I votes we call a fourwheeled cabman
A fourwheeled cabman was calledhis cab was one of the oldfashioned kind with straw in the bottomand he was asked by Anthea to drive them very carefully to their address
This he did and the price he asked for doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had given Cyril for Christmas
This cast a gloom but Cyril would never have stooped to argue about a cab fare for fear the cabman should think he was not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them
For a reason that was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggage on the steps and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily retired before he rang the bell
You see he said with his hand on the handle we dont want cook and Eliza asking us before HIM how it is weve come home alone as if we were babies
Here he rang the bell and the moment its answering clang was heard every one felt that it would be some time before that bell was answered
The sound of a bell is quite different somehow when there is anyone inside the house who hears it
I cant tell you why that isbut so it is
I expect theyre changing their dresses said Jane
Too late said Anthea it must be past five
I expect Elizas gone to post a letter and cooks gone to see the time
Cyril rang again
And the bell did its best to inform the listening children that there was really no one human in the house
They rang again and listened intently
The hearts of all sank low
It is a terrible thing to be locked out of your own house on a dark muggy January evening
There is no gas on anywhere said Jane in a broken voice
I expect theyve left the gas on once too often and the draught blew it out and theyre suffocated in their beds
Father always said they would some day said Robert cheerfully
Lets go and fetch a policeman said Anthea trembling
And be taken up for trying to be burglarsno thank you said Cyril
I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who got into his own mothers house and they got him made a burglar only the other day
I only hope the gas hasnt hurt the Phoenix said Anthea
It said it wanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard and I thought it would be all right because the servants never clean that out
But if its gone and got out and been choked by gasAnd besides directly we open the door we shall be choked too
I KNEW we ought to have gone to Aunt Emma at Croydon
Oh Squirrel I wish we had
Lets go NOW
Shut up said her brother briefly
Theres some one rattling the latch inside
Every one listened with all its ears and every one stood back as far from the door as the steps would allow
The latch rattled and clicked
Then the flap of the letterbox lifted itselfevery one saw it by the flickering light of the gaslamp that shone through the leafless limetree by the gatea golden eye seemed to wink at them through the letterslit and a cautious beak whispered Are you alone
Its the Phoenix said every one in a voice so joyous and so full of relief as to be a sort of whispered shout
Hush
said the voice from the letterbox slit
Your slaves have gone amerrymaking
The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak
But at the sidethe little window above the shelf whereon your bread liesit is not fastened
Righto
said Cyril
And Anthea added I wish youd meet us there dear Phoenix
The children crept round to the pantry window
It is at the side of the house and there is a green gate labelled Tradesmens Entrance which is always kept bolted
But if you get one foot on the fence between you and next door and one on the handle of the gate you are over before you know where you are
This at least was the experience of Cyril and Robert and even if the truth must be told of Anthea and Jane
So in almost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runs between that house and the next
Then Robert made a back and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his knickerbockered knee on the concrete windowsill
He dived into the pantry head first as one dives into water and his legs waved in the air as he went just as your legs do when you are first beginning to learn to dive
The soles of his bootssquarish muddy patchesdisappeared
Give me a leg up said Robert to his sisters
No you dont said Jane firmly
Im not going to be left outside here with just Anthea and have something creep up behind us out of the dark
Squirrel can go and open the back door
A light had sprung awake in the pantry
Cyril always said the Phoenix turned the gas on with its beak and lighted it with a waft of its wing but he was excited at the time and perhaps he really did it himself with matches and then forgot all about it
He let the others in by the back door
And when it had been bolted again the children went all over the house and lighted every single gasjet they could find
For they couldnt help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winters evening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at any moment
There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglarsor of anything else for that matter
And when all the gasjets were lighted it was quite clear that the Phoenix had made no mistake and that Eliza and cook were really out and that there was no one in the house except the four children and the Phoenix and the carpet and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboards on each side of the nursery fireplace
These last were very pleased that the children had come home again especially when Anthea had lighted the nursery fire
But as usual the children treated the loving little blackbeetles with coldness and disdain
I wonder whether you know how to light a fire
I dont mean how to strike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire someone has laid ready but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself
I will tell you how Anthea did it and if ever you have to light one yourself you may remember how it is done
First she raked out the ashes of the fire that had burned there a week agofor Eliza had actually never done this though she had had plenty of time
In doing this Anthea knocked her knuckle and made it bleed
Then she laid the largest and handsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate
Then she took a sheet of old newspaper you ought never to light a fire with todays newspaperit will not burn well and there are other reasons against it and tore it into four quarters and screwed each of these into a loose ball and put them on the cinders then she got a bundle of wood and broke the string and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends rested on the bars and the back ends on the back of the paper balls
In doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string and when she broke it two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek
Then she put more cinders and some bits of coalno dust
She put most of that on her hands but there seemed to be enough left for her face
Then she lighted the edges of the paper balls and waited till she heard the fizzcrackcrackfizz of the wood as it began to burn
Then she went and washed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen
Of course you need not bark your knuckles or cut your finger or bruise your cheek with wood or black yourself all over but otherwise this is a very good way to light a fire in London
In the real country fires are lighted in a different and prettier way
But it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards wherever you are
While Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the cheerful blaze Jane had set the table forI was going to say tea but the meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea
Let us call it a teaish meal
There was tea certainly for Antheas fire blazed and crackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately inviting the kettle to come and sit upon its lap
So the kettle was brought and tea made
But no milk could be foundso every one had six lumps of sugar to each cup instead
The things to eat on the other hand were nicer than usual
The boys looked about very carefully and found in the pantry some cold tongue bread butter cheese and part of a cold puddingvery much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home
And in the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake a pot of strawberry jam and about a pound of mixed candied fruit with soft crumbly slabs of delicious sugar in each cup of lemon orange or citron
It was indeed as Jane said a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight
The Phoenix perched on Roberts chair and listened kindly and politely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst and underneath the table by just stretching a toe down rather far the faithful carpet could be felt by alleven by Jane whose legs were very short
Your slaves will not return tonight said the Phoenix
They sleep under the roof of the cooks stepmothers aunt who is I gather hostess to a large party tonight in honour of her husbands cousins sisterinlaws mothers ninetieth birthday
I dont think they ought to have gone without leave said Anthea however many relations they have or however old they are but I suppose we ought to wash up
Its not our business about the leave said Cyril firmly but I simply wont wash up for them
We got it and well clear it away and then well go somewhere on the carpet
Its not often we get a chance of being out all night
We can go right away to the other side of the equator to the tropical climes and see the sun rise over the great Pacific Ocean
Right you are said Robert
I always did want to see the Southern Cross and the stars as big as gaslamps
DONT go said Anthea very earnestly because I COULDNT
Im SURE mother wouldnt like us to leave the house and I should hate to be left here alone
Id stay with you said Jane loyally
I know you would said Anthea gratefully but even with you Id much rather not
Well said Cyril trying to be kind and amiable I dont want you to do anything you thinks wrong BUT He was silent this silence said many things
I dont see Robert was beginning when Anthea interrupted Im quite sure
Sometimes you just think a things wrong and sometimes you KNOW
And this is a KNOW time
The Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly beak to say When it is as you say a know time there is no more to be said
And your noble brothers would never leave you
Of course not said Cyril rather quickly
And Robert said so too
I myself the Phoenix went on am willing to help in any way possible
I will go personallyeither by carpet or on the wingand fetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during the evening
In order to waste no time I could go while you wash upWhy it went on in a musing voice does one wash up teacups and wash down the stairs
You couldnt wash stairs up you know said Anthea unless you began at the bottom and went up feet first as you washed
I wish cook would try that way for a change
I dont said Cyril briefly
I should hate the look of her elasticside boots sticking up
This is mere trifling said the Phoenix
Come decide what I shall fetch for you
I can get you anything you like
But of course they couldnt decide
Many things were suggesteda rockinghorse jewelled chessmen an elephant a bicycle a motorcar books with pictures musical instruments and many other things
But a musical instrument is agreeable only to the player unless he has learned to play it really well books are not sociable bicycles cannot be ridden without going out of doors and the same is true of motorcars and elephants
Only two people can play chess at once with one set of chessmen and anyway its very much too much like lessons for a game and only one can ride on a rockinghorse
Suddenly in the midst of the discussion the Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor and from there it spoke
I gather it said from the carpet that it wants you to let it go to its old home where it was born and brought up and it will return within the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful and delightful products of its native land
What IS its native land
I didnt gather
But since you cant agree and time is passing and the teathings are not washed downI mean washed up I votes we do said Robert
Itll stop all this jaw anyway
And its not bad to have surprises
Perhaps its a Turkey carpet and it might bring us Turkish delight
Or a Turkish patrol said Robert
Or a Turkish bath said Anthea
Or a Turkish towel said Jane
Nonsense Robert urged it said beautiful and delightful and towels and baths arent THAT however good they may be for you
Let it go
I suppose it wont give us the slip he added pushing back his chair and standing up
Hush
said the Phoenix how can you
Dont trample on its feelings just because its only a carpet
But how can it do itunless one of us is on it to do the wishing
asked Robert
He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT be necessary for one to go and why not Robert
But the Phoenix quickly threw cold water on his newborn dream
Why you just write your wish on a paper and pin it on the carpet
So a leaf was torn from Antheas arithmetic book and on it Cyril wrote in large roundhand the following We wish you to go to your dear native home and bring back the most beautiful and delightful productions of it you canand not to be gone long please
Signed CYRIL
ROBERT
ANTHEA
JANE
Then the paper was laid on the carpet
Writing down please said the Phoenix the carpet cant read a paper whose back is turned to it any more than you can
It was pinned fast and the table and chairs having been moved the carpet simply and suddenly vanished rather like a patch of water on a hearth under a fierce fire
The edges got smaller and smaller and then it disappeared from sight
It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightful things said the Phoenix
I should wash upI mean wash down
So they did
There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle and every one helpedeven the Phoenix who took up cups by their handles with its clever claws and dipped them in the hot water and then stood them on the table ready for Anthea to dry them
But the bird was rather slow because as it said though it was not above any sort of honest work messing about with dishwater was not exactly what it had been brought up to
Everything was nicely washed up and dried and put in its proper place and the dishcloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper to dry and the teacloth was hung on the line that goes across the scullery
If you are a duchesss child or a kings or a person of high social positions child you will perhaps not know the difference between a dishcloth and a teacloth but in that case your nurse has been better instructed than you and she will tell you all about it
And just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being dried on the rollertowel behind the scullery door there came a strange sound from the other side of the kitchen wallthe side where the nursery was
It was a very strange sound indeedmost odd and unlike any other sounds the children had ever heard
At least they had heard sounds as much like it as a toy engines whistle is like a steam sirens
The carpets come back said Robert and the others felt that he was right
But what has it brought with it
asked Jane
It sounds like Leviathan that great beast
It couldnt have been made in India and have brought elephants
Even baby ones would be rather awful in that room said Cyril
I vote we take it in turns to squint through the keyhole
They didin the order of their ages
The Phoenix being the eldest by some thousands of years was entitled to the first peep
But Excuse me it said ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing softly looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my golden eyes
So Cyril looked
I see something grey moving said he
Its a zoological garden of some sort I bet said Robert when he had taken his turn
And the soft rustling bustling ruffling scuffling shuffling fluffling noise went on inside
I cant see anything said Anthea my eye tickles so
Then Janes turn came and she put her eye to the keyhole
Its a giant kittycat she said and its asleep all over the floor
Giant cats are tigersfather said so
No he didnt
He said tigers were giant cats
Its not at all the same thing
Its no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for you if youre afraid to look at them when they come said the Phoenix sensibly
And Cyril being the eldest said Come on and turned the handle
The gas had been left full on after tea and everything in the room could be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door
At least not everything for though the carpet was there it was invisible because it was completely covered by the hundred and ninetynine beautiful objects which it had brought from its birthplace
My hat
Cyril remarked
I never thought about its being a PERSIAN carpet
Yet it was now plain that it was so for the beautiful objects which it had brought back were catsPersian cats grey Persian cats and there were as I have said 199 of them and they were sitting on the carpet as close as they could get to each other
But the moment the children entered the room the cats rose and stretched and spread and overflowed from the carpet to the floor and in an instant the floor was a sea of moving mewing pussishness and the children with one accord climbed to the table and gathered up their legs and the people next door knocked on the walland indeed no wonder for the mews were Persian and piercing
This is pretty poor sport said Cyril
Whats the matter with the bounders
I imagine that they are hungry said the Phoenix
If you were to feed them We havent anything to feed them with said Anthea in despair and she stroked the nearest Persian back
Oh pussies do be quietwe cant hear ourselves think
She had to shout this entreaty for the mews were growing deafening and it would take pounds and pounds worth of catsmeat
Lets ask the carpet to take them away said Robert
But the girls said No
They are so soft and pussy said Jane
And valuable said Anthea hastily
We can sell them for lots and lots of money
Why not send the carpet to get food for them
suggested the Phoenix and its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the effort it had to be make to be heard above the increasing fierceness of the Persian mews
So it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persian cats and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before
The carpet seemed to gather itself together and the cats dropped off it as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it
And the carpet disappeared
Unless you have had onehundred and ninetynine wellgrown Persian cats in one small room all hungry and all saying so in unmistakable mews you can form but a poor idea of the noise that now deafened the children and the Phoenix
The cats did not seem to have been at all properly brought up
They seemed to have no idea of its being a mistake in manners to ask for meals in a strange houselet alone to howl for themand they mewed and they mewed and they mewed and they mewed till the children poked their fingers into their ears and waited in silent agony wondering why the whole of Camden Town did not come knocking at the door to ask what was the matter and only hoping that the food for the cats would come before the neighbours didand before all the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to be given away beyond recall to an indignant neighbourhood
The cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out and unfolded their Persian tails and the children and the Phoenix huddled together on the table
The Phoenix Robert noticed suddenly was trembling
So many cats it said and they might not know I was the Phoenix
These accidents happen so quickly
It quite unmans me
This was a danger of which the children had not thought
Creep in cried Robert opening his jacket
And the Phoenix crept inonly just in time for green eyes had glared pink noses had sniffed white whiskers had twitched and as Robert buttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of eager grey Persian fur
And on the instant the good carpet slapped itself down on the floor
And it was covered with ratsthree hundred and ninetyeight of them I believe two for each cat
How horrible
cried Anthea
Oh take them away
Take yourself away said the Phoenix and me
I wish wed never had a carpet said Anthea in tears
They hustled and crowded out of the door and shut it and locked it
Cyril with great presence of mind lit a candle and turned off the gas at the main
The ratsll have a better chance in the dark he said
The mewing had ceased
Every one listened in breathless silence
We all know that cats eat ratsit is one of the first things we read in our little brown reading books but all those cats eating all those ratsit wouldnt bear thinking of
Suddenly Robert sniffed in the silence of the dark kitchen where the only candle was burning all on one side because of the draught
What a funny scent
he said
And as he spoke a lantern flashed its light through the window of the kitchen a face peered in and a voice said Whats all this row about
You let me in
It was the voice of the police
Robert tiptoed to the window and spoke through the pane that had been a little cracked since Cyril accidentally knocked it with a walkingstick when he was playing at balancing it on his nose
It was after they had been to a circus
What do you mean
he said
Theres no row
You listen everythings as quiet as quiet
And indeed it was
The strange sweet scent grew stronger and the Phoenix put out its beak
The policeman hesitated
Theyre MUSKrats said the Phoenix
I suppose some cats eat thembut never Persian ones
What a mistake for a wellinformed carpet to make
Oh what a night were having
Do go away said Robert nervously
Were just going to bedthats our bedroom candle there isnt any row
Everythings as quiet as a mouse
A wild chorus of mews drowned his words and with the mews were mingled the shrieks of the muskrats
What had happened
Had the cats tasted them before deciding that they disliked the flavour
Im acoming in said the policeman
Youve got a cat shut up there
A cat said Cyril
Oh my only aunt
A cat
Come in then said Robert
Its your own look out
I advise you not
Wait a shake and Ill undo the side gate
He undid the side gate and the policeman very cautiously came in
And there in the kitchen by the light of one candle with the mewing and the screaming going like a dozen steam sirens twenty waiting on motorcars and half a hundred squeaking pumps four agitated voices shouted to the policeman four mixed and wholly different explanations of the very mixed events of the evening
Did you ever try to explain the simplest thing to a policeman
CHAPTER 8 THE CATS THE COW AND THE BURGLAR The nursery was full of Persian cats and muskrats that had been brought there by the wishing carpet
The cats were mewing and the muskrats were squeaking so that you could hardly hear yourself speak
In the kitchen were the four children one candle a concealed Phoenix and a very visible policeman
Now then look here said the Policeman very loudly and he pointed his lantern at each child in turn whats the meaning of this here yelling and caterwauling
I tell you youve got a cat here and some ones a illtreating of it
What do you mean by it eh
It was five to one counting the Phoenix but the policeman who was one was of unusually fine size and the five including the Phoenix were small
The mews and the squeaks grew softer and in the comparative silence Cyril said Its true
There are a few cats here
But weve not hurt them
Its quite the opposite
Weve just fed them
It dont sound like it said the policeman grimly
I daresay theyre not REAL cats said Jane madly perhaps theyre only dreamcats
Ill dreamcat you my lady was the brief response of the force
If you understood anything except people who do murders and stealings and naughty things like that Id tell you all about it said Robert but Im certain you dont
Youre not meant to shove your oar into peoples private catkeepings
Youre only supposed to interfere when people shout murder and stop thief in the street
So there
The policeman assured them that he should see about that and at this point the Phoenix who had been making itself small on the potshelf under the dresser among the saucepan lids and the fish kettle walked on tiptoed claws in a noiseless and modest manner and left the room unnoticed by any one
Oh dont be so horrid Anthea was saying gently and earnestly
We LOVE catsdear pussysoft things
We wouldnt hurt them for worlds
Would we Pussy
And Jane answered that of course they wouldnt
And still the policeman seemed unmoved by their eloquence
Now look here he said Im agoing to see whats in that room beyond there and His voice was drowned in a wild burst of mewing and squeaking
And as soon as it died down all four children began to explain at once and though the squeaking and mewing were not at their very loudest yet there was quite enough of both to make it very hard for the policeman to understand a single word of any of the four wholly different explanations now poured out to him
Stow it he said at last
Im agoin into the next room in the execution of my duty
Im agoin to use my eyesmy ears have gone off their chumps what with you and them cats
And he pushed Robert aside and strode through the door
Dont say I didnt warn you said Robert
Its tigers REALLY said Jane
Father said so
I wouldnt go in if I were you
But the policeman was quite stony nothing any one said seemed to make any difference to him
Some policemen are like this I believe
He strode down the passage and in another moment he would have been in the room with all the cats and all the rats musk but at that very instant a thin sharp voice screamed from the street outside Murdermurder
Stop thief
The policeman stopped with one regulation boot heavily poised in the air
Eh
he said
And again the shrieks sounded shrilly and piercingly from the dark street outside
Come on said Robert
Come and look after cats while somebodys being killed outside
For Robert had an inside feeling that told him quite plainly WHO it was that was screaming
You young rip said the policeman Ill settle up with you bimeby
And he rushed out and the children heard his boots going weightily along the pavement and the screams also going along rather ahead of the policeman and both the murderscreams and the policemans boots faded away in the remote distance
Then Robert smacked his knickerbocker loudly with his palm and said Good old Phoenix
I should know its golden voice anywhere
And then every one understood how cleverly the Phoenix had caught at what Robert had said about the real work of a policeman being to look after murderers and thieves and not after cats and all hearts were filled with admiring affection
But hell come back said Anthea mournfully as soon as it finds the murderer is only a bright vision of a dream and there isnt one at all really
No he wont said the soft voice of the clever Phoenix as it flew in
HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS
I heard him own as much to a fellow mercenary
Oh
what a night we are having
Lock the door and let us rid ourselves of this intolerable smell of the perfume peculiar to the muskrat and to the house of the trimmers of beards
If youll excuse me I will go to bed
I am worn out
It was Cyril who wrote the paper that told the carpet to take away the rats and bring milk because there seemed to be no doubt in any breast that however Persian cats may be they must like milk
Lets hope it wont be muskmilk said Anthea in gloom as she pinned the paper facedownwards on the carpet
Is there such a thing as a muskcow
she added anxiously as the carpet shrivelled and vanished
I do hope not
Perhaps really it WOULD have been wiser to let the carpet take the cats away
Its getting quite late and we cant keep them all night
Oh cant we
was the bitter rejoinder of Robert who had been fastening the side door
You might have consulted me he went on
Im not such an idiot as some people
Why whatever Dont you see
Weve jolly well GOT to keep the cats all nightoh get down you furry beastsbecause weve had three wishes out of the old carpet now and we cant get any more till tomorrow
The liveliness of Persian mews alone prevented the occurrence of a dismal silence
Anthea spoke first
Never mind she said
Do you know I really do think theyre quieting down a bit
Perhaps they heard us say milk
They cant understand English said Jane
You forget theyre Persian cats Panther
Well said Anthea rather sharply for she was tired and anxious who told you milk wasnt Persian for milk
Lots of English words are just the same in Frenchat least I know miaw is and croquet and fiance
Oh pussies do be quiet
Lets stroke them as hard as we can with both hands and perhaps theyll stop
So every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired and as soon as a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was pushed gently away and another mewing mouser was approached by the hands of the strokers
And the noise was really more than half purr when the carpet suddenly appeared in its proper place and on it instead of rows of milkcans or even of milkjugs there was a COW
Not a Persian cow either nor most fortunately a muskcow if there is such a thing but a smooth sleek duncoloured Jersey cow who blinked large soft eyes at the gaslight and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner
Anthea had always been afraid of cows but now she tried to be brave
Anyway it cant run after me she said to herself There isnt room for it even to begin to run
The cow was perfectly placid
She behaved like a strayed duchess till some one brought a saucer for the milk and some one else tried to milk the cow into it
Milking is very difficult
You may think it is easy but it is not
All the children were by this time strung up to a pitch of heroism that would have been impossible to them in their ordinary condition
Robert and Cyril held the cow by the horns and Jane when she was quite sure that their end of the cow was quite secure consented to stand by ready to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise
Anthea holding the saucer now advanced towards the cow
She remembered to have heard that cows when milked by strangers are susceptible to the soothing influence of the human voice
So clutching her saucer very tight she sought for words to whose soothing influence the cow might be susceptible
And her memory troubled by the events of the night which seemed to go on and on for ever and ever refused to help her with any form of words suitable to address a Jersey cow in
Poor pussy then
Lie down then good dog lie down
was all that she could think of to say and she said it
And nobody laughed
The situation full of grey mewing cats was too serious for that
Then Anthea with a beating heart tried to milk the cow
Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of her hand and trampled on it with one foot while with the other three she had walked on a foot each of Robert Cyril and Jane
Jane burst into tears
Oh how much too horrid everything is
she cried
Come away
Lets go to bed and leave the horrid cats with the hateful cow
Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else
And serve them right
They did not go to bed but they had a shivering council in the drawingroom which smelt of sootand indeed a heap of this lay in the fender
There had been no fire in the room since mother went away and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places and the chrysanthemums were dead and the water in the pot nearly dried up
Anthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round Jane and herself while Robert and Cyril had a struggle silent and brief but fierce for the larger share of the fur hearthrug
It is most truly awful said Anthea and I am so tired
Lets let the cats loose
And the cow perhaps
said Cyril
The police would find us at once
That cow would stand at the gate and mewI mean mooto come in
And so would the cats
No I see quite well what weve got to do
We must put them in baskets and leave them on peoples doorsteps like orphan foundlings
Weve got three baskets counting mothers work one said Jane brightening
And there are nearly two hundred cats said Anthea besides the cowand it would have to be a differentsized basket for her and then I dont know how youd carry it and youd never find a doorstep big enough to put it on
Except the church oneand Oh well said Cyril if you simply MAKE difficulties Im with you said Robert
Dont fuss about the cow Panther
Its simply GOT to stay the night and Im sure Ive read that the cow is a remunerating creature and that means it will sit still and think for hours
The carpet can take it away in the morning
And as for the baskets well do them up in dusters or pillowcases or bathtowels
Come on Squirrel
You girls can be out of it if you like
His tone was full of contempt but Jane and Anthea were too tired and desperate to care even being out of it which at other times they could not have borne now seemed quite a comfort
They snuggled down in the sofa blanket and Cyril threw the fur hearthrug over them
Ah he said thats all women are fit forto keep safe and warm while the men do the work and run dangers and risks and things
Im not said Anthea you know Im not
But Cyril was gone
It was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug and Jane snuggled up close to her sister and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly and in a sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as Robert opened the door of the nursery
They heard the booted search for baskets in the back kitchen
They heard the side door open and close and they knew that each brother had gone out with at least one cat
Antheas last thought was that it would take at least all night to get rid of one hundred and ninetynine cats by twos
There would be ninetynine journeys of two cats each and one cat over
I almost think we might keep the one cat over said Anthea
I dont seem to care for cats just now but I daresay I shall again some day
And she fell asleep
Jane also was sleeping
It was Jane who awoke with a start to find Anthea still asleep
As in the act of awakening she kicked her sister she wondered idly why they should have gone to bed in their boots but the next moment she remembered where they were
There was a sound of muffled shuffled feet on the stairs
Like the heroine of the classic poem Jane thought it was the boys and as she felt quite wide awake and not nearly so tired as before she crept gently from Antheas side and followed the footsteps
They went down into the basement the cats who seemed to have fallen into the sleep of exhaustion awoke at the sound of the approaching footsteps and mewed piteously
Jane was at the foot of the stairs before she saw it was not her brothers whose coming had roused her and the cats but a burglar
She knew he was a burglar at once because he wore a fur cap and a red and black charitycheck comforter and he had no business where he was
If you had been stood in janes shoes you would no doubt have run away in them appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid screams
But Jane knew better
She had read a great many nice stories about burglars as well as some affecting pieces of poetry and she knew that no burglar will ever hurt a little girl if he meets her when burgling
Indeed in all the cases Jane had read of his burglarishness was almost at once forgotten in the interest he felt in the little girls artless prattle
So if Jane hesitated for a moment before addressing the burglar it was only because she could not at once think of any remark sufficiently prattling and artless to make a beginning with
In the stories and the affecting poetry the child could never speak plainly though it always looked old enough to in the pictures
And Jane could not make up her mind to lisp and talk baby even to a burglar
And while she hesitated he softly opened the nursery door and went in
Jane followedjust in time to see him sit down flat on the floor scattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water
She closed the door softly and stood there still wondering whether she COULD bring herself to say Whats oo doing here Mithter Wobber
and whether any other kind of talk would do
Then she heard the burglar draw a long breath and he spoke
Its a judgement he said so help me bob if it aint
Oh eres a thing to appen to a chap
Makes it come ome to you dont it neither
Cats an cats an cats
There couldnt be all them cats
Let alone the cow
If she aint the moral of the old mans Daisy
Shes a dream out of when I was a ladI dont mind er so much
Ere Daisy Daisy
The cow turned and looked at him
SHES all right he went on
Sort of company too
Though them above knows how she got into this downstairs parlour
But them catsoh take em away take em away
Ill chuck the ole showOh take em away
Burglar said Jane close behind him and he started convulsively and turned on her a blank face whose pale lips trembled
I cant take those cats away
Lor lumme
exclaimed the man if ere aint another on em
Are you real miss or something Ill wake up from presently
I am quite real said Jane relieved to find that a lisp was not needed to make the burglar understand her
And so she added are the cats
Then send for the police send for the police and Ill go quiet
If you aint no realler than them cats Im done spunchuckout of time
Send for the police
Ill go quiet
One thing thered not be room for arf them cats in no cell as ever I see
He ran his fingers through his hair which was short and his eyes wandered wildly round the roomful of cats
Burglar said Jane kindly and softly if you didnt like cats what did you come here for
Send for the police was the unfortunate criminals only reply
Id rather you wouldhonest Id rather
I darent said Jane and besides Ive no one to send
I hate the police
I wish hed never been born
Youve a feeling art miss said the burglar but them cats is really a little bit too thick
Look here said Jane I wont call the police
And I am quite a real little girl though I talk older than the kind youve met before when youve been doing your burglings
And they are real catsand they want real milkandDidnt you say the cow was like somebodys Daisy that you used to know
Wish I may die if she aint the very spit of her replied the man
Well then said Janeand a thrill of joyful pride ran through herperhaps you know how to milk cows
Perhaps I does was the burglars cautious rejoinder
Then said Jane if you will ONLY milk oursyou dont know how we shall always love you
The burglar replied that loving was all very well
If those cats only had a good long wet thirsty drink of milk Jane went on with eager persuasion theyd lie down and go to sleep as likely as not and then the police wont come back
But if they go on mewing like this he will and then I dont know whatll become of us or you either
This argument seemed to decide the criminal
Jane fetched the washbowl from the sink and he spat on his hands and prepared to milk the cow
At this instant boots were heard on the stairs
Its all up said the man desperately this eres a plant
ERES the police
He made as if to open the window and leap from it
Its all right I tell you whispered Jane in anguish
Ill say youre a friend of mine or the good clergyman called in or my uncle or ANYTHIINGonly do do do milk the cow
Oh DONT goohoh thank goodness its only the boys
It was and their entrance had awakened Anthea who with her brothers now crowded through the doorway
The man looked about him like a rat looks round a trap
This is a friend of mine said Jane hes just called in and hes going to milk the cow for us
ISNT it good and kind of him
She winked at the others and though they did not understand they played up loyally
How do
said Cyril Very glad to meet you
Dont let us interrupt the milking
I shall ave a ead and a arf in the morning and no bloomin error remarked the burglar but he began to milk the cow
Robert was winked at to stay and see that he did not leave off milking or try to escape and the others went to get things to put the milk in for it was now spurting and foaming in the washbowl and the cats had ceased from mewing and were crowding round the cow with expressions of hope and anticipation on their whiskered faces
We cant get rid of any more cats said Cyril as he and his sisters piled a tray high with saucers and soupplates and platters and piedishes the police nearly got us as it was
Not the same onea much stronger sort
He thought it really was a foundling orphan wed got
If it hadnt been for me throwing the two bags of cat slap in his eye and hauling Robert over a railing and lying like mice under a laurelbushWell its jolly lucky Im a good shot thats all
He pranced off when hed got the catbags off his facethought wed bolted
And here we are
The gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the handbowl seemed to have soothed the burglar very much
He went on milking in a sort of happy dream while the children got a cap and ladled the warm milk out into the piedishes and plates and platters and saucers and set them down to the music of Persian purrs and lappings
It makes me think of old times said the burglar smearing his ragged coatcuff across his eyesabout the apples in the orchard at home and the rats at threshing time and the rabbits and the ferrets and how pretty it was seeing the pigs killed
Finding him in this softened mood Jane said I wish youd tell us how you came to choose our house for your burglaring tonight
I am awfully glad you did
You have been so kind
I dont know what we should have done without you she added hastily
We all love you ever so
Do tell us
The others added their affectionate entreaties and at last the burglar said Well its my first job and I didnt expect to be made so welcome and thats the truth young gents and ladies
And I dont know but what it wont be my last
For this ere cow she reminds me of my father and I know ow ed ave ided me if Id laid ands on a apenny as wasnt my own
Im sure he would Jane agreed kindly but what made you come here
Well miss said the burglar you know best ow you come by them cats and why you dont like the police so Ill give myself away free and trust to your noble earts
Youd best bale out a bit the pans getting fullish
I was aselling oranges off of my barrowfor I aint a burglar by trade though you ave used the name so freean there was a lady bought three aporth off me
An while she was apickin of them outvery careful indeed and Im always glad when them sort gets a few overripe onesthere was two other ladies talkin over the fence
An one on em said to the other on em just like this Ive told both gells to come and they can doss in with Mria and Jane cause their boss and his missis is miles away and the kids too
So they can just lock up the ouse and leave the gas aburning sos no one wont know and get back bright an early by leven oclock
And well make a night of it Mrs Prosser so we will
Im just agoing to run out to pop the letter in the post
And then the lady what had chosen the three haporth so careful she said Lor Mrs Wigson I wonder at you and your hands all over suds
This good gentlemanll slip it into the post for yer Ill be bound seeing Im a customer of his
So they give me the letter and of course I read the direction what was written on it afore I shoved it into the post
And then when Id sold my barrowful I was agoin ome with the chink in my pocket and Im blowed if some bloomin thievin beggar didnt nick the lot whilst I was just awettin of my whistle for callin of oranges is dry work
Nicked the bloomin lot e didand me with not a farden to take ome to my brother and his missus
How awful
said Anthea with much sympathy
Horful indeed miss I believe yer the burglar rejoined with deep feeling
You dont know her temper when shes roused
An Im sure I ope you never may neither
And Id ad all my oranges off of em
So it came back to me what was wrote on the ongverlope and I says to myself Why not seein as Ive been done myself and if they keeps two slaveys there must be some pickings
An so ere I am
But them cats theyve brought me back to the ways of honestness
Never no more
Look here said Cyril these cats are very valuablevery indeed
And we will give them all to you if only you will take them away
I see theyre a breedy lot replied the burglar
But I dont want no bother with the coppers
Did you come by them honest now
Straight
They are all our very own said Anthea we wanted them but the confidement Consignment whispered Cyril
was larger than we wanted and theyre an awful bother
If you got your barrow and some sacks or baskets your brothers missus would be awfully pleased
My father says Persian cats are worth pounds and pounds each
Well said the burglarand he was certainly moved by her remarksI see youre in a holeand I dont mind lending a helping and
I dont ask ow you come by them
But Ive got a pales a mark on cats
Ill fetch him along and if he thinks theyd fetch anything above their skins I dont mind doin you a kindness
You wont go away and never come back said Jane because I dont think I COULD bear that
The burglar quite touched by her emotion swore sentimentally that alive or dead he would come back
Then he went and Cyril and Robert sent the girls to bed and sat up to wait for his return
It soon seemed absurd to await him in a state of wakefulness but his stealthy tap on the window awoke them readily enough
For he did return with the pal and the barrow and the sacks
The pal approved of the cats now dormant in Persian repletion and they were bundled into the sacks and taken away on the barrowmewing indeed but with mews too sleepy to attract public attention
Im a fencethats what I am said the burglar gloomily
I never thought Id come down to this and all acause er my kind eart
Cyril knew that a fence is a receiver of stolen goods and he replied briskly I give you my sacred the cats arent stolen
What do you make the time
I aint got the time on me said the palbut it was just about chuckingout time as I come by the Bull and Gate
I shouldnt wonder if it was nigh upon one now
When the cats had been removed and the boys and the burglar had parted with warm expressions of friendship there remained only the cow
She must stay all night said Robert
Cookll have a fit when she sees her
All night
said Cyril
Whyits tomorrow morning if its one
We can have another wish
So the carpet was urged in a hastily written note to remove the cow to wherever she belonged and to return to its proper place on the nursery floor
But the cow could not be got to move on to the carpet
So Robert got the clothes line out of the back kitchen and tied one end very firmly to the cows horns and the other end to a bunchedup corner of the carpet and said Fire away
And the carpet and cow vanished together and the boys went to bed tired out and only too thankful that the evening at last was over
Next morning the carpet lay calmly in its place but one corner was very badly torn
It was the corner that the cow had been tied on to
CHAPTER 9 THE BURGLARS BRIDE The morning after the adventure of the Persian cats the muskrats the common cow and the uncommon burglar all the children slept till it was ten oclock and then it was only Cyril who woke but he attended to the others so that by half past ten every one was ready to help to get breakfast
It was shivery cold and there was but little in the house that was really worth eating
Robert had arranged a thoughtful little surprise for the absent servants
He had made a neat and delightful booby trap over the kitchen door and as soon as they heard the front door click open and knew the servants had come back all four children hid in the cupboard under the stairs and listened with delight to the entrancethe tumble the splash the scuffle and the remarks of the servants
They heard the cook say it was a judgement on them for leaving the place to itself she seemed to think that a booby trap was a kind of plant that was quite likely to grow all by itself in a dwelling that was left shut up
But the housemaid more acute judged that someone must have been in the housea view confirmed by the sight of the breakfast things on the nursery table
The cupboard under the stairs was very tight and paraffiny however and a silent struggle for a place on top ended in the door bursting open and discharging Jane who rolled like a football to the feet of the servants
Now said Cyril firmly when the cooks hysterics had become quieter and the housemaid had time to say what she thought of them dont you begin jawing us
We arent going to stand it
We know too much
Youll please make an extra special treacle roley for dinner and well have a tinned tongue
I daresay said the housemaid indignant still in her outdoor things and with her hat very much on one side
Dont you come athreatening me Master Cyril because I wont stand it so I tell you
You tell your ma about us being out
Much I care
Shell be sorry for me when she hears about my dear greataunt by marriage as brought me up from a child and was a mother to me
She sent for me she did she wasnt expected to last the night from the spasms going to her legsand cook was that kind and careful she couldnt let me go alone so Dont said Anthea in real distress
You know where liars go to Elizaat least if you dont Liars indeed
said Eliza I wont demean myself talking to you
Hows Mrs Wigson
said Robert and DID you keep it up last night
The mouth of the housemaid fell open
Did you doss with Maria or Emily
asked Cyril
How did Mrs Prosser enjoy herself
asked Jane
Forbear said Cyril theyve had enough
Whether we tell or not depends on your later life he went on addressing the servants
If you are decent to us well be decent to you
Youd better make that treacle roleyand if I were you Eliza Id do a little housework and cleaning just for a change
The servants gave in once and for all
Theres nothing like firmness Cyril went on when the breakfast things were cleared away and the children were alone in the nursery
People are always talking of difficulties with servants
Its quite simple when you know the way
We can do what we like now and they wont peach
I think weve broken THEIR proud spirit
Lets go somewhere by carpet
I wouldnt if I were you said the Phoenix yawning as it swooped down from its roost on the curtain pole
Ive given you one or two hints but now concealment is at an end and I see I must speak out
It perched on the back of a chair and swayed to and fro like a parrot on a swing
Whats the matter now
said Anthea
She was not quite so gentle as usual because she was still weary from the excitement of last nights cats
Im tired of things happening
I shant go anywhere on the carpet
Im going to darn my stockings
Darn
said the Phoenix darn
From those young lips these strange expressions Mend then said Anthea with a needle and wool
The Phoenix opened and shut its wings thoughtfully
Your stockings it said are much less important than they now appear to you
But the carpetlook at the bare worn patches look at the great rent at yonder corner
The carpet has been your faithful friendyour willing servant
How have you requited its devoted service
Dear Phoenix Anthea urged dont talk in that horrid lecturing tone
You make me feel as if Id done something wrong
And really it is a wishing carpet and we havent done anything else to itonly wishes
Only wishes repeated the Phoenix ruffling its neck feathers angrily and what sort of wishes
Wishing people to be in a good temper for instance
What carpet did you ever hear of that had such a wish asked of it
But this noble fabric on which you trample so recklessly every one removed its boots from the carpet and stood on the linoleum this carpet never flinched
It did what you asked but the wear and tear must have been awful
And then last nightI dont blame you about the cats and the rats for those were its own choice but what carpet could stand a heavy cow hanging on to it at one corner
I should think the cats and rats were worse said Robert look at all their claws
Yes said the bird eleven thousand nine hundred and forty of themI daresay you noticed
I should be surprised if these had not left their mark
Good gracious said Jane sitting down suddenly on the floor and patting the edge of the carpet softly do you mean its WEARING OUT
Its life with you has not been a luxurious one said the Phoenix
French mud twice
Sand of sunny shores twice
Soaking in southern seas once
India once
Goodness knows where in Persia once
muskratland once
And once wherever the cow came from
Hold your carpet up to the light and with cautious tenderness if YOU please
With cautious tenderness the boys held the carpet up to the light the girls looked and a shiver of regret ran through them as they saw how those eleven thoousand nine hundred and forty claws had run through the carpet
It was full of little holes there were some large ones and more than one thin place
At one corner a strip of it was torn and hung forlornly
We must mend it said Anthea never mind about my stockings
I can sew them up in lumps with sewing cotton if theres no time to do them properly
I know its awful and no girl would who respected herself and all that but the poor dear carpets more important than my silly stockings
Lets go out now this very minute
So out they all went and bought wool to mend the carpet but there is no shop in Camden Town where you can buy wishingwool no nor in Kentish Town either
However ordinary Scotch heathermixture fingering seemed good enough and this they bought and all that day Jane and Anthea darned and darned and darned
The boys went out for a walk in the afternoon and the gentle Phoenix paced up and down the tablefor exercise as it saidand talked to the industrious girls about their carpet
It is not an ordinary ignorant innocent carpet from Kidderminster it said it is a carpet with a pasta Persian past
Do you know that in happier years when that carpet was the property of caliphs viziers kings and sultans it never lay on a floor
I thought the floor was the proper home of a carpet Jane interrupted
Not of a MAGIC carpet said the Phoenix why if it had been allowed to lie about on floors there wouldnt be much of it left now
No indeed
It has lived in chests of cedarwood inlaid with pearl and ivory wrapped in priceless tissues of cloth of gold embroidered with gems of fabulous value
It has reposed in the sandalwood caskets of princesses and in the roseattarscented treasurehouses of kings
Never never had any one degraded it by walking on itexcept in the way of business when wishes were required and then they always took their shoes off
And YOU Oh DONT
said Jane very near tears
You know youd never have been hatched at all if it hadnt been for mother wanting a carpet for us to walk on
You neednt have walked so much or so hard
said the bird but come dry that crystal tear and I will relate to you the story of the Princess Zulieka the Prince of Asia and the magic carpet
Relate away said AntheaI mean please do
The Princess Zulieka fairest of royal ladies began the bird had in her cradle been the subject of several enchantments
Her grandmother had been in her day But what in her day Zuliekas grandmother had been was destined never to be revealed for Cyril and Robert suddenly burst into the room and on each brow were the traces of deep emotion
On Cyrils pale brow stood beads of agitation and perspiration and on the scarlet brow of Robert was a large black smear
What ails ye both
asked the Phoenix and it added tartly that storytelling was quite impossible if people would come interrupting like that
Oh do shut up for any sake
said Cyril sinking into a chair
Robert smoothed the ruffled golden feathers adding kindly Squirrel doesnt mean to be a beast
Its only that the MOST AWFUL thing has happened and stories dont seem to matter so much
Dont be cross
You wont be when youve heard whats happened
Well what HAS happened
said the bird still rather crossly and Anthea and Jane paused with long needles poised in air and long needlefuls of Scotch heathermixture fingering wool drooping from them
The most awful thing you can possibly think of said Cyril
That nice chapour own burglarthe police have got him on suspicion of stolen cats
Thats what his brothers missis told me
Oh begin at the beginning
cried Anthea impatiently
Well then we went out and down by where the undertakers is with the china flowers in the windowyou know
There was a crowd and of course we went to have a squint
And it was two bobbies and our burglar between them and he was being dragged along and he said I tell you them cats was GIVE me
I got em in exchange for me milking a cow in a basement parlour up Camden Town way
And the people laughed
Beasts
And then one of the policemen said perhaps he could give the name and address of the cow and he said no he couldnt but he could take them there if theyd only leave go of his coat collar and give him a chance to get his breath
And the policeman said he could tell all that to the magistrate in the morning
He didnt see us and so we came away
Oh Cyril how COULD you
said Anthea
Dont be a puddinghead Cyril advised
A fat lot of good it would have done if wed let him see us
No one would have believed a word we said
Theyd have thought we were kidding
We did better than let him see us
We asked a boy where he lived and he told us and we went there and its a little greengrocers shop and we bought some Brazil nuts
Here they are
The girls waved away the Brazil nuts with loathing and contempt
Well we had to buy SOMETHING and while we were making up our minds what to buy we heard his brothers missis talking
She said when he came home with all them miaoulers she thought there was more in it than met the eye
But he WOULD go out this morning with the two likeliest of them one under each arm
She said he sent her out to buy blue ribbon to put round their beastly necks and she said if he got three months hard it was her dying word that hed got the blue ribbon to thank for it that and his own silly thieving ways taking cats that anybody would know he couldnt have come by in the way of business instead of things that wouldnt have been missed which Lord knows there are plenty such and Oh STOP
cried Jane
And indeed it was time for Cyril seemed like a clock that had been wound up and could not help going on
Where is he now
At the policestation said Robert for Cyril was out of breath
The boy told us theyd put him in the cells and would bring him up before the Beak in the morning
I thought it was a jolly lark last nightgetting him to take the catsbut now The end of a lark said the Phoenix is the Beak
Lets go to him cried both the girls jumping up
Lets go and tell the truth
They MUST believe us
They CANT said Cyril
Just think
If any one came to you with such a tale you couldnt believe it however much you tried
We should only mix things up worse for him
There must be something we could do said Jane sniffing very muchmy own dear pet burglar
I cant bear it
And he was so nice the way he talked about his father and how he was going to be so extra honest
Dear Phoenix you MUST be able to help us
Youre so good and kind and pretty and clever
Do do tell us what to do
The Phoenix rubbed its beak thoughtfully with its claw
You might rescue him it said and conceal him here till the lawsupporters had forgotten about him
That would be ages and ages said Cyril and we couldnt conceal him here
Father might come home at any moment and if he found the burglar here HE wouldnt believe the true truth any more than the police would
Thats the worst of the truth
Nobody ever believes it
Couldnt we take him somewhere else
Jane clapped her hands
The sunny southern shore
she cried where the cook is being queen
He and she would be company for each other
And really the idea did not seem bad if only he would consent to go
So all talking at once the children arranged to wait till evening and then to seek the dear burglar in his lonely cell
Meantime Jane and Anthea darned away as hard as they could to make the carpet as strong as possible
For all felt how terrible it would be if the precious burglar while being carried to the sunny southern shore were to tumble through a hole in the carpet and be lost for ever in the sunny southern sea
The servants were tired after Mrs Wigsons party so every one went to bed early and when the Phoenix reported that both servants were snoring in a heartfelt and candid manner the children got upthey had never undressed just putting their nightgowns on over their things had been enough to deceive Eliza when she came to turn out the gas
So they were ready for anything and they stood on the carpet and said I wish we were in our burglars lonely cell
and instantly they were
I think every one had expected the cell to be the deepest dungeon below the castle moat
I am sure no one had doubted that the burglar chained by heavy fetters to a ring in the damp stone wall would be tossing uneasily on a bed of straw with a pitcher of water and a mouldering crust untasted beside him
Robert remembering the underground passage and the treasure had brought a candle and matches but these were not needed
The cell was a little whitewashed room about twelve feet long and six feet wide
On one side of it was a sort of shelf sloping a little towards the wall
On this were two rugs striped blue and yellow and a waterproof pillow
Rolled in the rugs and with his head on the pillow lay the burglar fast asleep
He had had his tea though this the children did not knowit had come from the coffeeshop round the corner in very thick crockery
The scene was plainly revealed by the light of a gaslamp in the passage outside which shone into the cell through a pane of thick glass over the door
I shall gag him said Cyril and Robert will hold him down
Anthea and Jane and the Phoenix can whisper soft nothings to him while he gradually awakes
This plan did not have the success it deserved because the burglar curiously enough was much stronger even in his sleep than Robert and Cyril and at the first touch of their hands he leapt up and shouted out something very loud indeed
Instantly steps were heard outside
Anthea threw her arms round the burglar and whispered Its usthe ones that gave you the cats
Weve come to save you only dont let on were here
Cant we hide somewhere
Heavy boots sounded on the flagged passage outside and a firm voice shouted Hereyoustop that row will you
All right governor replied the burglar still with Antheas arms round him I was only atalking in my sleep
No offence
It was an awful moment
Would the boots and the voice come in
Yes
No
The voice said Well stow it will you
And the boots went heavily away along the passage and up some sounding stone stairs
Now then whispered Anthea
How the blue Moses did you get in
asked the burglar in a hoarse whisper of amazement
On the carpet said Jane truly
Stow that said the burglar
One on you I could a swallowed but fourAND a yellow fowl
Look here said Cyril sternly you wouldnt have believed any one if theyd told you beforehand about your finding a cow and all those cats in our nursery
That I wouldnt said the burglar with whispered fervour so help me Bob I wouldnt
Well then Cyril went on ignoring this appeal to his brother just try to believe what we tell you and act accordingly
It cant do you any HARM you know he went on in hoarse whispered earnestness
You cant be very much worse off than you are now you know
But if youll just trust to us well get you out of this right enough
No one saw us come in
The question is where would you like to go
Id like to go to Boolong was the instant reply of the burglar
Ive always wanted to go on that there trip but Ive never ad the ready at the right time of the year
Boolong is a town like London said Cyril well meaning but inaccurate how could you get a living there
The burglar scratched his head in deep doubt
Its ard to get a onest living anywheres nowadays he said and his voice was sad
Yes isnt it
said Jane sympathetically but how about a sunny southern shore where theres nothing to do at all unless you want to
Thats my billet miss replied the burglar
I never did care about worknot like some people always fussing about
Did you never like any sort of work
asked Anthea severely
Lor lumme yes he answered gardening was my obby so it was
But father died afore e could bind me to a nurseryman an  Well take you to the sunny southern shore said Jane youve no idea what the flowers are like
Our old cooks there said Anthea
Shes queen Oh chuck it the burglar whispered clutching at his head with both hands
I knowed the first minute I see them cats and that cow as it was a judgement on me
I dont know now whether Im astanding on my hat or my boots so help me I dont
If you CAN get me out get me and if you cant get along with you for goodness sake and give me a chanst to think about whatll be most likely to go down with the Beak in the morning
Come on to the carpet then said Anthea gently shoving
The others quietly pulled and the moment the feet of the burglar were planted on the carpet Anthea wished I wish we were all on the sunny southern shore where cook is
And instantly they were
There were the rainbow sands the tropic glories of leaf and flower and there of course was the cook crowned with white flowers and with all the wrinkles of crossness and tiredness and hard work wiped out of her face
Why cook youre quite pretty
Anthea said as soon as she had got her breath after the tumblerushwhirl of the carpet
The burglar stood rubbing his eyes in the brilliant tropic sunlight and gazing wildly round him on the vivid hues of the tropic land
Penny plain and tuppence coloured
he exclaimed pensively and well worth any tuppence however hardearned
The cook was seated on a grassy mound with her court of coppercoloured savages around her
The burglar pointed a grimy finger at these
Are they tame
he asked anxiously
Do they bite or scratch or do anything to yer with poisoned arrows or oyster shells or that
Dont you be so timid said the cook
Looke ere this eres only a dream what youve come into an as its only a dream theres no nonsense about what a young lady like me ought to say or not so Ill say youre the bestlooking fellow Ive seen this many a day
And the dream goes on and on seemingly as long as you behaves
The things what you has to eat and drink tastes just as good as real ones and Look ere said the burglar Ive come ere straight outer the pleece station
These ere kidsll tell you it aint no blame er mine
Well you WERE a burglar you know said the truthful Anthea gently
Only because I was druv to it by dishonest blokes as well you knows miss rejoined the criminal
Blowed if this aint the ottest January as Ive known for years
Wouldnt you like a bath
asked the queen and some white clothes like me
I should only look a juggins in em miss thanking you all the same was the reply but a bath I wouldnt resist and my shirt was only clean on week before last
Cyril and Robert led him to a rocky pool where he bathed luxuriously
Then in shirt and trousers he sat on the sand and spoke
That cook or queen or whatever you call herher with the white bokay on her edshes my sort
Wonder if shed keep company
I should ask her
I was always a quick hitter the man went on its a word and a blow with me
I will
In shirt and trousers and crowned with a scented flowery wreath which Cyril hastily wove as they returned to the court of the queen the burglar stood before the cook and spoke
Look ere miss he said
You an me being all forlornlike both on us in this ere dream or whatever you calls it Id like to tell you straight as I likes yer looks
The cook smiled and looked down bashfully
Im a single manwhat you might call a batcheldore
Im mild in my abits which these kidsll tell you the same and Id like to ave the pleasure of walkin out with you next Sunday
Lor
said the queen cook ow sudden you are mister
Walking out means youre going to be married said Anthea
Why not get married and have done with it
I would
I dont mind if I do said the burglar
But the cook said No miss
Not me not even in a dream
I dont say anythink agin the young chaps looks but I always swore Id be married in church if at alland anyway I dont believe these here savages would know how to keep a registering office even if I was to show them
No mister thanking you kindly if you cant bring a clergyman into the dream Ill live and die like what I am
Will you marry her if we get a clergyman
asked the matchmaking Anthea
Im agreeable miss I m sure said he pulling his wreath straight
Ow this ere bokay do tiddle a chaps ears to be sure
So very hurriedly the carpet was spread out and instructed to fetch a clergyman
The instructions were written on the inside of Cyrils cap with a piece of billiard chalk Robert had got from the marker at the hotel at Lyndhurst
The carpet disappeared and more quickly than you would have thought possible it came back bearing on its bosom the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop
The Reverend Septimus was rather a nice young man but very much mazed and muddled because when he saw a strange carpet laid out at his feet in his own study he naturally walked on it to examine it more closely
And he happened to stand on one of the thin places that Jane and Anthea had darned so that he was half on wishing carpet and half on plain Scotch heathermixture fingering which has no magic properties at all
The effect of this was that he was only half thereso that the children could just see through him as though he had been a ghost
And as for him he saw the sunny southern shore the cook and the burglar and the children quite plainly but through them all he saw quite plainly also his study at home with the books and the pictures and the marble clock that had been presented to him when he left his last situation
He seemed to himself to be in a sort of insane fit so that it did not matter what he didand he married the burglar to the cook
The cook said that she would rather have had a solider kind of a clergyman one that you couldnt see through so plain but perhaps this was real enough for a dream
And of course the clergyman though misty was really real and able to marry people and he did
When the ceremony was over the clergyman wandered about the island collecting botanical specimens for he was a great botanist and the ruling passion was strong even in an insane fit
There was a splendid wedding feast
Can you fancy Jane and Anthea and Robert and Cyril dancing merrily in a ring handinhand with coppercoloured savages round the happy couple the queen cook and the burglar consort
There were more flowers gathered and thrown than you have ever even dreamed of and before the children took carpet for home the now marriedandsettled burglar made a speech
Ladies and gentlemen he said and savages of both kinds only I know you cant understand what Im a saying of but well let that pass
If this is a dream Im on
If it aint Im onner than ever
If its betwixt and betweenwell Im honest and I cant say more
I dont want no more igh London societyIve got some one to put my arm around of and Ive got the whole lot of this ere island for my allotment and if I dont grow some broccoli asll open the judges eye at the cottage flower shows well strike me pink
All I ask is as these young gents and ladiesll bring some parsley seed into the dream and a pennorth of radish seed and threepennorth of onion and I wouldnt mind goin to fourpence or fippence for mixed kale only I aint got a brown so I dont deceive you
And theres one thing more you might take away the parson
I dont like things what I can see alf through so heres how
He drained a coconutshell of palm wine
It was now past midnightthough it was teatime on the island
With all good wishes the children took their leave
They also collected the clergyman and took him back to his study and his presentation clock
The Phoenix kindly carried the seeds next day to the burglar and his bride and returned with the most satisfactory news of the happy pair
Hes made a wooden spade and started on his allotment it said and she is weaving him a shirt and trousers of the most radiant whiteness
The police never knew how the burglar got away
In Kentish Town Police Station his escape is still spoken of with bated breath as the Persian mystery
As for the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop he felt that he had had a very insane fit indeed and he was sure it was due to overstudy
So he planned a little dissipation and took his two maiden aunts to Paris where they enjoyed a dazzling round of museums and picture galleries and came back feeling that they had indeed seen life
He never told his aunts or any one else about the marriage on the islandbecause no one likes it to be generally known if he has had insane fits however interesting and unusual
CHAPTER 10 THE HOLE IN THE CARPET Hooray
hooray
hooray
Mother comes home today Mother comes home today Hooray
hooray
hooray
Jane sang this simple song directly after breakfast and the Phoenix shed crystal tears of affectionate sympathy
How beautiful it said is filial devotion
She wont be home till past bedtime though said Robert
We might have one more carpetday
He was glad that mother was coming homequite glad very glad but at the same time that gladness was rudely contradicted by a quite strong feeling of sorrow because now they could not go out all day on the carpet
I do wish we could go and get something nice for mother only shed want to know where we got it said Anthea
And shed never never believe it the truth
People never do somehow if its at all interesting
Ill tell you what said Robert
Suppose we wished the carpet to take us somewhere where we could find a purse with money in itthen we could buy her something
Suppose it took us somewhere foreign and the purse was covered with strange Eastern devices embroidered in rich silks and full of money that wasnt money at all here only foreign curiosities then we couldnt spend it and people would bother about where we got it and we shouldnt know how on earth to get out of it at all
Cyril moved the table off the carpet as he spoke and its leg caught in one of Antheas darns and ripped away most of it as well as a large slit in the carpet
Well now you HAVE done it said Robert
But Anthea was a really firstclass sister
She did not say a word till she had got out the Scotch heathermixture fingering wool and the darningneedle and the thimble and the scissors and by that time she had been able to get the better of her natural wish to be thoroughly disagreeable and was able to say quite kindly Never mind Squirrel Ill soon mend it
Cyril thumped her on the back
He understood exactly how she had felt and he was not an ungrateful brother
Respecting the purse containing coins the Phoenix said scratching its invisible ear thoughtfully with its shining claw it might be as well perhaps to state clearly the amount which you wish to find as well as the country where you wish to find it and the nature of the coins which you prefer
It would be indeed a cold moment when you should find a purse containing but three oboloi
How much is an oboloi
An obol is about twopence halfpenny the Phoenix replied
Yes said Jane and if you find a purse I suppose it is only because some one has lost it and you ought to take it to the policeman
The situation remarked the Phoenix does indeed bristle with difficulties
What about a buried treasure said Cyril and every one was dead that it belonged to
Mother wouldnt believe THAT said more than one voice
Suppose said Robertsuppose we asked to be taken where we could find a purse and give it back to the person it belonged to and they would give us something for finding it
We arent allowed to take money from strangers
You know we arent Bobs said Anthea making a knot at the end of a needleful of Scotch heathermixture fingering wool which is very wrong and you must never do it when you are darning
No THAT wouldnt do said Cyril
Lets chuck it and go to the North Pole or somewhere really interesting
No said the girls together there must be SOME way
Wait a sec Anthea added
Ive got an idea coming
Dont speak
There was a silence as she paused with the darningneedle in the air
Suddenly she spoke I see
Lets tell the carpet to take us somewhere where we can get the money for mothers present andandand get it some way that shell believe in and not think wrong
Well I must say you are learning the way to get the most out of the carpet said Cyril
He spoke more heartily and kindly than usual because he remembered how Anthea had refrained from snarking him about tearing the carpet
Yes said the Phoenix you certainly are
And you have to remember that if you take a thing out it doesnt stay in
No one paid any attention to this remark at the time but afterwards every one thought of it
Do hurry up Panther said Robert and that was why Anthea did hurry up and why the big darn in the middle of the carpet was all open and webby like a fishing net not tight and close like woven cloth which is what a good wellbehaved darn should be
Then every one put on its outdoor things the Phoenix fluttered on to the mantelpiece and arranged its golden feathers in the glass and all was ready
Every one got on to the carpet
Please go slowly dear carpet Anthea began we like to see where were going
And then she added the difficult wish that had been decided on
Next moment the carpet stiff and raftlike was sailing over the roofs of Kentish Town
I wishNo I dont mean that
I mean its a PITY we arent higher up said Anthea as the edge of the carpet grazed a chimneypot
Thats right
Be careful said the Phoenix in warning tones
If you wish when youre on a wishing carpet you DO wish and theres an end of it
So for a short time no one spoke and the carpet sailed on in calm magnificence over St Pancras and Kings Cross stations and over the crowded streets of Clerkenwell
Were going out Greenwich way said Cyril as they crossed the streak of rough tumbled water that was the Thames
We might go and have a look at the Palace
On and on the carpet swept still keeping much nearer to the chimneypots than the children found at all comfortable
And then just over New Cross a terrible thing happened
Jane and Robert were in the middle of the carpet
Part of them was on the carpet and part of themthe heaviest partwas on the great central darn
Its all very misty said Jane it looks partly like out of doors and partly like in the nursery at home
I feel as if I was going to have measles everything looked awfully rum then remember
I feel just exactly the same Robert said
Its the hole said the Phoenix its not measles whatever that possession may be
And at that both Robert and Jane suddenly and at once made a bound to try and get on to the safer part of the carpet and the darn gave way and their boots went up and the heavy heads and bodies of them went down through the hole and they landed in a position something between sitting and sprawling on the flat leads on the top of a high grey gloomy respectable house whose address was 705 Amersham Road New Cross
The carpet seemed to awaken to new energy as soon as it had got rid of their weight and it rose high in the air
The others lay down flat and peeped over the edge of the rising carpet
Are you hurt
cried Cyril and Robert shouted No and next moment the carpet had sped away and Jane and Robert were hidden from the sight of the others by a stack of smoky chimneys
Oh how awful
said Anthea
It might have been worse said the Phoenix
What would have been the sentiments of the survivors if that darn had given way when we were crossing the river
Yes theres that said Cyril recovering himself
Theyll be all right
Theyll howl till some one gets them down or drop tiles into the front garden to attract attention of passersby
Bobs has got my oneandfivepencelucky you forgot to mend that hole in my pocket Panther or he wouldnt have had it
They can tram it home
But Anthea would not be comforted
Its all my fault she said
I KNEW the proper way to darn and I didnt do it
Its all my fault
Lets go home and patch the carpet with your Etonssomething really strongand send it to fetch them
All right said Cyril but your Sunday jacket is stronger than my Etons
We must just chuck mothers present thats all
I wish Stop
cried the Phoenix the carpet is dropping to earth
And indeed it was
It sank swiftly yet steadily and landed on the pavement of the Deptford Road
It tipped a little as it landed so that Cyril and Anthea naturally walked off it and in an instant it had rolled itself up and hidden behind a gatepost
It did this so quickly that not a single person in the Deptford Road noticed it
The Phoenix rustled its way into the breast of Cyrils coat and almost at the same moment a wellknown voice remarked Well I never
What on earth are you doing here
They were face to face with their pet uncletheir Uncle Reginald
We DID think of going to Greenwich Palace and talking about Nelson said Cyril telling as much of the truth as he thought his uncle could believe
And where are the others
asked Uncle Reginald
I dont exactly know Cyril replied this time quite truthfully
Well said Uncle Reginald I must fly
Ive a case in the County Court
Thats the worst of being a beastly solicitor
One cant take the chances of life when one gets them
If only I could come with you to the Painted Hall and give you lunch at the Ship afterwards
But alas
it may not be
The uncle felt in his pocket
I mustnt enjoy myself he said but thats no reason why you shouldnt
Here divide this by four and the product ought to give you some desired result
Take care of yourselves
Adieu
And waving a cheery farewell with his neat umbrella the good and highhatted uncle passed away leaving Cyril and Anthea to exchange eloquent glances over the shining golden sovereign that lay in Cyrils hand
Well
said Anthea
Well
said Cyril
Well
said the Phoenix
Good old carpet
said Cyril joyously
It WAS clever of itso adequate and yet so simple said the Phoenix with calm approval
Oh come on home and lets mend the carpet
I am a beast
Id forgotten the others just for a minute said the consciencestricken Anthea
They unrolled the carpet quickly and slylythey did not want to attract public attentionand the moment their feet were on the carpet Anthea wished to be at home and instantly they were
The kindness of their excellent uncle had made it unnecessary for them to go to such extremes as Cyrils Etons or Antheas Sunday jacket for the patching of the carpet
Anthea set to work at once to draw the edges of the broken darn together and Cyril hastily went out and bought a large piece of the marblepatterned American oilcloth which careful housewives use to cover dressers and kitchen tables
It was the strongest thing he could think of
Then they set to work to line the carpet throughout with the oilcloth
The nursery felt very odd and empty without the others and Cyril did not feel so sure as he had done about their being able to tram it home
So he tried to help Anthea which was very good of him but not much use to her
The Phoenix watched them for a time but it was plainly growing more and more restless
It fluffed up its splendid feathers and stood first on one gilded claw and then on the other and at last it said I can bear it no longer
This suspense
My Robertwho set my egg to hatchin the bosom of whose Norfolk raiment I have nestled so often and so pleasantly
I think if youll excuse me YesDO cried Anthea I wish wed thought of asking you before
Cyril opened the window
The Phoenix flapped its sunbright wings and vanished
So THATS all right said Cyril taking up his needle and instantly pricking his hand in a new place
Of course I know that what you have really wanted to know about all this time is not what Anthea and Cyril did but what happened to Jane and Robert after they fell through the carpet on to the leads of the house which was called number 705 Amersham Road
But I had to tell you the other first
That is one of the most annoying things about stories you cannot tell all the different parts of them at the same time
Roberts first remark when he found himself seated on the damp cold sooty leads was Heres a go
Janes first act was tears
Dry up Pussy dont be a little duffer said her brother kindly itll be all right
And then he looked about just as Cyril had known he would for something to throw down so as to attract the attention of the wayfarers far below in the street
He could not find anything
Curiously enough there were no stones on the leads not even a loose tile
The roof was of slate and every single slate knew its place and kept it
But as so often happens in looking for one thing he found another
There was a trapdoor leading down into the house
And that trapdoor was not fastened
Stop snivelling and come here Jane he cried encouragingly
Lend a hand to heave this up
If we can get into the house we might sneak down without meeting any one with luck
Come on
They heaved up the door till it stood straight up and as they bent to look into the hole below the door fell back with a hollow clang on the leads behind and with its noise was mingled a bloodcurdling scream from underneath
Discovered
hissed Robert
Oh my cats alive
They were indeed discovered
They found themselves looking down into an attic which was also a lumberroom
It had boxes and broken chairs old fenders and pictureframes and ragbags hanging from nails
In the middle of the floor was a box open half full of clothes
Other clothes lay on the floor in neat piles
In the middle of the piles of clothes sat a lady very fat indeed with her feet sticking out straight in front of her
And it was she who had screamed and who in fact was still screaming
Dont
cried Jane please dont
We wont hurt you
Where are the rest of your gang
asked the lady stopping short in the middle of a scream
The others have gone on on the wishing carpet said Jane truthfully
The wishing carpet
said the lady
Yes said Jane before Robert could say You shut up
You must have read about it
The Phoenix is with them
Then the lady got up and picking her way carefully between the piles of clothes she got to the door and through it
She shut it behind her and the two children could hear her calling Septimus
Septimus
in a loud yet frightened way
Now said Robert quickly Ill drop first
He hung by his hands and dropped through the trapdoor
Now you
Hang by your hands
Ill catch you
Oh theres no time for jaw
Drop I say
Jane dropped
Robert tried to catch her and even before they had finished the breathless roll among the piles of clothes which was what his catching ended in he whispered Well hidebehind those fenders and things theyll think weve gone along the roofs
Then when all is calm well creep down the stairs and take our chance
They hastily hid
A corner of an iron bedstead stuck into Roberts side and Jane had only standing room for one footbut they bore itand when the lady came back not with Septimus but with another lady they held their breath and their hearts beat thickly
Gone
said the first lady poor little thingsquite mad my dearand at large
We must lock this room and send for the police
Let me look out said the second lady who was if possible older and thinner and primmer than the first
So the two ladies dragged a box under the trapdoor and put another box on the top of it and then they both climbed up very carefully and put their two trim tidy heads out of the trapdoor to look for the mad children
Now whispered Robert getting the bedstead leg out of his side
They managed to creep out from their hidingplace and out through the door before the two ladies had done looking out of the trapdoor on to the empty leads
Robert and Jane tiptoed down the stairsone flight two flights
Then they looked over the banisters
Horror
a servant was coming up with a loaded scuttle
The children with one consent crept swiftly through the first open door
The room was a study calm and gentlemanly with rows of books a writing table and a pair of embroidered slippers warming themselves in the fender
The children hid behind the windowcurtains
As they passed the table they saw on it a missionarybox with its bottom label torn off open and empty
Oh how awful
whispered Jane
We shall never get away alive
Hush
said Robert not a moment too soon for there were steps on the stairs and next instant the two ladies came into the room
They did not see the children but they saw the empty missionary box
I knew it said one
Selina it WAS a gang
I was certain of it from the first
The children were not mad
They were sent to distract our attention while their confederates robbed the house
I am afraid you are right said Selina and WHERE ARE THEY NOW
Downstairs no doubt collecting the silver milkjug and sugarbasin and the punchladle that was Uncle Joes and Aunt Jerushas teaspoons
I shall go down
Oh dont be so rash and heroic said Selina
Amelia we must call the police from the window
Lock the door
I WILLI will The words ended in a yell as Selina rushing to the window came face to face with the hidden children
Oh dont
said Jane how can you be so unkind
We ARENT burglars and we havent any gang and we didnt open your missionarybox
We opened our own once but we didnt have to use the money so our consciences made us put it back andDONT
Oh I wish you wouldnt Miss Selina had seized Jane and Miss Amelia captured Robert
The children found themselves held fast by strong slim hands pink at the wrists and white at the knuckles
Weve got YOU at any rate said Miss Amelia
Selina your captive is smaller than mine
You open the window at once and call Murder
as loud as you can
Selina obeyed but when she had opened the window instead of calling Murder
she called Septimus
because at that very moment she saw her nephew coming in at the gate
In another minute he had let himself in with his latchkey and had mounted the stairs
As he came into the room Jane and Robert each uttered a shriek of joy so loud and so sudden that the ladies leaped with surprise and nearly let them go
Its our own clergyman cried Jane
Dont you remember us
asked Robert
You married our burglar for usdont you remember
I KNEW it was a gang said Amelia
Septimus these abandoned children are members of a desperate burgling gang who are robbing the house
They have already forced the missionarybox and purloined its contents
The Reverend Septimus passed his hand wearily over his brow
I feel a little faint he said running upstairs so quickly
We never touched the beastly box said Robert
Then your confederates did said Miss Selina
No no said the curate hastily
I opened the box myself
This morning I found I had not enough small change for the Mothers Independent Unity Measles and Croup Insurance payments
I suppose this is NOT a dream is it
Dream
No indeed
Search the house
I insist upon it
The curate still pale and trembling searched the house which of course was blamelessly free of burglars
When he came back he sank wearily into his chair
Arent you going to let us go
asked Robert with furious indignation for there is something in being held by a strong lady that sets the blood of a boy boiling in his veins with anger and despair
Weve never done anything to you
Its all the carpet
It dropped us on the leads
WE couldnt help it
You know how it carried you over to the island and you had to marry the burglar to the cook
Oh my head
said the curate
Never mind your head just now said Robert try to be honest and honourable and do your duty in that state of life
This is a judgement on me for something I suppose said the Reverend Septimus wearily but I really cannot at the moment remember what
Send for the police said Miss Selina
Send for a doctor said the curate
Do you think they ARE mad then said Miss Amelia
I think I am said the curate
Jane had been crying ever since her capture
Now she said You arent now but perhaps you will be ifAnd it would serve you jolly well right too
Aunt Selina said the curate and Aunt Amelia believe me this is only an insane dream
You will realize it soon
It has happened to me before
But do not let us be unjust even in a dream
Do not hold the children they have done no harm
As I said before it was I who opened the box
The strong bony hands unwillingly loosened their grasp
Robert shook himself and stood in sulky resentment
But Jane ran to the curate and embraced him so suddenly that he had not time to defend himself
Youre a dear she said
It IS like a dream just at first but you get used to it
Now DO let us go
Theres a good kind honourable clergyman
I dont know said the Reverend Septimus its a difficult problem
It is such a very unusual dream
Perhaps its only a sort of other lifequite real enough for you to be mad in
And if youre mad there might be a dreamasylum where youd be kindly treated and in time restored cured to your sorrowing relatives
It is very hard to see your duty plainly even in ordinary life and these dreamcircumstances are so complicated If its a dream said Robert you will wake up directly and then youd be sorry if youd sent us into a dreamasylum because you might never get into the same dream again and let us out and so we might stay there for ever and then what about our sorrowing relatives who arent in the dreams at all
But all the curate could now say was Oh my head
And Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness
A really conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage
And then just as the hopelessness and the helplessness were getting to be almost more than they could bear the two children suddenly felt that extraordinary shrinking feeling that you always have when you are just going to vanish
And the next moment they had vanished and the Reverend Septimus was left alone with his aunts
I knew it was a dream he cried wildly
Ive had something like it before
Did you dream it too Aunt Selina and you Aunt Amelia
I dreamed that you did you know
Aunt Selina looked at him and then at Aunt Amelia
Then she said boldly What do you mean
WE havent been dreaming anything
You must have dropped off in your chair
The curate heaved a sigh of relief
Oh if its only I he said if wed all dreamed it I could never have believed it never
Afterwards Aunt Selina said to the other aunt Yes I know it was an untruth and I shall doubtless be punished for it in due course
But I could see the poor dear fellows brain giving way before my very eyes
He couldnt have stood the strain of three dreams
It WAS odd wasnt it
All three of us dreaming the same thing at the same moment
We must never tell dear Seppy
But I shall send an account of it to the Psychical Society with stars instead of names you know
And she did
And you can read all about it in one of the societys fat Bluebooks
Of course you understand what had happened
The intelligent Phoenix had simply gone straight off to the Psammead and had wished Robert and Jane at home
And of course they were at home at once
Cyril and Anthea had not half finished mending the carpet
When the joyful emotions of reunion had calmed down a little they all went out and spent what was left of Uncle Reginalds sovereign in presents for mother
They bought her a pink silk handkerchief a pair of blue and white vases a bottle of scent a packet of Christmas candles and a cake of soap shaped and coloured like a tomato and one that was so like an orange that almost any one you had given it to would have tried to peel itif they liked oranges of course
Also they bought a cake with icing on and the rest of the money they spent on flowers to put in the vases
When they had arranged all the things on a table with the candles stuck up on a plate ready to light the moment mothers cab was heard they washed themselves thoroughly and put on tidier clothes
Then Robert said Good old Psammead and the others said so too
But really its just as much good old Phoenix said Robert
Suppose it hadnt thought of getting the wish
Ah
said the Phoenix it is perhaps fortunate for you that I am such a competent bird
Theres mothers cab cried Anthea and the Phoenix hid and they lighted the candles and next moment mother was home again
She liked her presents very much and found their story of Uncle Reginald and the sovereign easy and even pleasant to believe
Good old carpet were Cyrils last sleepy words
What there is of it said the Phoenix from the cornicepole
CHAPTER 11 THE BEGINNING OF THE END Well I MUST say mother said looking at the wishing carpet as it lay all darned and mended and backed with shiny American cloth on the floor of the nurseryI MUST say Ive never in my life bought such a bad bargain as that carpet
A soft Oh
of contradiction sprang to the lips of Cyril Robert Jane and Anthea
Mother looked at them quickly and said Well of course I see youve mended it very nicely and that was sweet of you dears
The boys helped too said the dears honourably
But stilltwentytwo and ninepence
It ought to have lasted for years
Its simply dreadful now
Well never mind darlings youve done your best
I think well have coconut matting next time
A carpet doesnt have an easy life of it in this room does it
Its not our fault mother is it that our boots are the really reliable kind
Robert asked the question more in sorrow than in anger
No dear we cant help our boots said mother cheerfully but we might change them when we come in perhaps
Its just an idea of mine
I wouldnt dream of scolding on the very first morning after Ive come home
Oh my Lamb how could you
This conversation was at breakfast and the Lamb had been beautifully good until every one was looking at the carpet and then it was for him but the work of a moment to turn a glass dish of syrupy blackberry jam upside down on his young head
It was the work of a good many minutes and several persons to get the jam off him again and this interesting work took peoples minds off the carpet and nothing more was said just then about its badness as a bargain and about what mother hoped for from coconut matting
When the Lamb was clean again he had to be taken care of while mother rumpled her hair and inked her fingers and made her head ache over the difficult and twisted housekeeping accounts which cook gave her on dirty bits of paper and which were supposed to explain how it was that cook had only fivepencehalfpenny and a lot of unpaid bills left out of all the money mother had sent her for housekeeping
Mother was very clever but even she could not quite understand the cooks accounts
The Lamb was very glad to have his brothers and sisters to play with him
He had not forgotten them a bit and he made them play all the old exhausting games Whirling Worlds where you swing the baby round and round by his hands and Leg and Wing where you swing him from side to side by one ankle and one wrist
There was also climbing Vesuvius
In this game the baby walks up you and when he is standing on your shoulders you shout as loud as you can which is the rumbling of the burning mountain and then tumble him gently on to the floor and roll him there which is the destruction of Pompeii
All the same I wish we could decide what wed better say next time mother says anything about the carpet said Cyril breathlessly ceasing to be a burning mountain
Well you talk and decide said Anthea here you lovely ducky Lamb
Come to Panther and play Noahs Ark
The Lamb came with his pretty hair all tumbled and his face all dusty from the destruction of Pompeii and instantly became a baby snake hissing and wriggling and creeping in Antheas arms as she said I love my little baby snake He hisses when he is awake He creeps with such a wriggly creep He wriggles even in his sleep
Crocky said the Lamb and showed all his little teeth
So Anthea went on I love my little crocodile I love his truthful toothful smile It is so wonderful and wide I like to see itFROM OUTSIDE
Well you see Cyril was saying its just the old bother
Mother cant believe the real true truth about the carpet and You speak sooth O Cyril remarked the Phoenix coming out from the cupboard where the blackbeetles lived and the torn books and the broken slates and odd pieces of toys that had lost the rest of themselves
Now hear the wisdom of Phoenix the son of the Phoenix There is a society called that said Cyril
Where is it
And what is a society
asked the bird
Its a sort of joinedtogether lot of peoplea sort of brotherhooda kind ofwell something very like your temple you know only quite different
I take your meaning said the Phoenix
I would fain see these calling themselves Sons of the Phoenix But what about your words of wisdom
Wisdom is always welcome said the Phoenix
Pretty Polly
remarked the Lamb reaching his hands towards the golden speaker
The Phoenix modestly retreated behind Robert and Anthea hastened to distract the attention of the Lamb by murmuring I love my little baby rabbit But oh
he has a dreadful habit Of paddling out among the rocks And soaking both his bunny socks
I dont think youd care about the sons of the Phoenix really said Robert
I have heard that they dont do anything fiery
They only drink a great deal
Much more than other people because they drink lemonade and fizzy things and the more you drink of those the more good you get
In your mind perhaps said Jane but it wouldnt be good in your body
Youd get too balloony
The Phoenix yawned
Look here said Anthea I really have an idea
This isnt like a common carpet
Its very magic indeed
Dont you think if we put Tatcho on it and then gave it a rest the magic part of it might grow like hair is supposed to do
It might said Robert but I should think paraffin would do as wellat any rate as far as the smell goes and that seems to be the great thing about Tatcho
But with all its faults Antheas idea was something to do and they did it
It was Cyril who fetched the Tatcho bottle from fathers washhandstand
But the bottle had not much in it
We mustnt take it all Jane said in case fathers hair began to come off suddenly
If he hadnt anything to put on it it might all drop off before Eliza had time to get round to the chemists for another bottle
It would be dreadful to have a bald father and it would all be our fault
And wigs are very expensive I believe said Anthea
Look here leave enough in the bottle to wet fathers head all over with in case any emergency emergesand lets make up with paraffin
I expect its the smell that does the good reallyand the smells exactly the same
So a small teaspoonful of the Tatcho was put on the edges of the worst darn in the carpet and rubbed carefully into the roots of the hairs of it and all the parts that there was not enough Tatcho for had paraffin rubbed into them with a piece of flannel
Then the flannel was burned
It made a gay flame which delighted the Phoenix and the Lamb
How often said mother opening the doorhow often am I to tell you that you are NOT to play with paraffin
What have you been doing
We have burnt a paraffiny rag Anthea answered
It was no use telling mother what they had done to the carpet
She did not know it was a magic carpet and no one wants to be laughed at for trying to mend an ordinary carpet with lampoil
Well dont do it again said mother
And now away with melancholy
Father has sent a telegram
Look
She held it out and the children holding it by its yielding corners read Box for kiddies at Garrick
Stalls for us Haymarket
Meet Charing Cross 630
That means said mother that youre going to see The Water Babies all by your happy selves and father and I will take you and fetch you
Give me the Lamb dear and you and Jane put clean lace in your red evening frocks and I shouldnt wonder if you found they wanted ironing
This paraffin smell is ghastly
Run and get out your frocks
The frocks did want ironingwanted it rather badly as it happened for being of tomatoColoured Liberty silk they had been found very useful for tableaux vivants when a red dress was required for Cardinal Richelieu
They were very nice tableaux these and I wish I could tell you about them but one cannot tell everything in a story
You would have been specially interested in hearing about the tableau of the Princes in the Tower when one of the pillows burst and the youthful Princes were so covered with feathers that the picture might very well have been called Michaelmas Eve or Plucking the Geese
Ironing the dresses and sewing the lace in occupied some time and no one was dull because there was the theatre to look forward to and also the possible growth of hairs on the carpet for which every one kept looking anxiously
By four oclock Jane was almost sure that several hairs were beginning to grow
The Phoenix perched on the fender and its conversation as usual was entertaining and instructivelike school prizes are said to be
But it seemed a little absentminded and even a little sad
Dont you feel well Phoenix dear
asked Anthea stooping to take an iron off the fire
I am not sick replied the golden bird with a gloomy shake of the head but I am getting old
Why youve hardly been hatched any time at all
Time remarked the Phoenix is measured by heartbeats
Im sure the palpitations Ive had since Ive known you are enough to blanch the feathers of any bird
But I thought you lived 500 years said Robert and youve hardly begun this set of years
Think of all the time thats before you
Time said the Phoenix is as you are probably aware merely a convenient fiction
There is no such thing as time
I have lived in these two months at a pace which generously counterbalances 500 years of life in the desert
I am old I am weary
I feel as if I ought to lay my egg and lay me down to my fiery sleep
But unless Im careful I shall be hatched again instantly and that is a misfortune which I really do not think I COULD endure
But do not let me intrude these desperate personal reflections on your youthful happiness
What is the show at the theatre tonight
Wrestlers
Gladiators
A combat of cameleopards and unicorns
I dont think so said Cyril its called The Water Babies and if its like the book there isnt any gladiating in it
There are chimneysweeps and professors and a lobster and an otter and a salmon and children living in the water
It sounds chilly
The Phoenix shivered and went to sit on the tongs
I dont suppose there will be REAL water said Jane
And theatres are very warm and pretty with a lot of gold and lamps
Wouldnt you like to come with us
I was just going to say that said Robert in injured tones only I know how rude it is to interrupt
Do come Phoenix old chap it will cheer you up
Itll make you laugh like any thing
Mr Bourchier always makes ripping plays
You ought to have seen Shockheaded Peter last year
Your words are strange said the Phoenix but I will come with you
The revels of this Bourchier of whom you speak may help me to forget the weight of my years
So that evening the Phoenix snugged inside the waistcoat of Roberts Etonsa very tight fit it seemed both to Robert and to the Phoenixand was taken to the play
Robert had to pretend to be cold at the glittering manymirrored restaurant where they ate dinner with father in evening dress with a very shiny white shirtfront and mother looking lovely in her grey evening dress that changes into pink and green when she moves
Robert pretended that he was too cold to take off his greatcoat and so sat sweltering through what would otherwise have been a most thrilling meal
He felt that he was a blot on the smart beauty of the family and he hoped the Phoenix knew what he was suffering for its sake
Of course we are all pleased to suffer for the sake of others but we like them to know it unless we are the very best and noblest kind of people and Robert was just ordinary
Father was full of jokes and fun and every one laughed all the time even with their mouths full which is not manners
Robert thought father would not have been quite so funny about his keeping his overcoat on if father had known all the truth
And there Robert was probably right
When dinner was finished to the last grape and the last paddle in the finger glassesfor it was a really truly grownup dinnerthe children were taken to the theatre guided to a box close to the stage and left
Fathers parting words were Now dont you stir out of this box whatever you do
I shall be back before the end of the play
Be good and you will be happy
Is this zone torrid enough for the abandonment of greatcoats Bobs
No
Well then I should say you were sickening for somethingmumps or measles or thrush or teething
Goodbye
He went and Robert was at last able to remove his coat mop his perspiring brow and release the crushed and dishevelled Phoenix
Robert had to arrange his damp hair at the lookingglass at the back of the box and the Phoenix had to preen its disordered feathers for some time before either of them was fit to be seen
They were very very early
When the lights went up fully the Phoenix balancing itself on the gilded back of a chair swayed in ecstasy
How fair a scene is this
it murmured how far fairer than my temple
Or have I guessed aright
Have you brought me hither to lift up my heart with emotions of joyous surprise
Tell me my Robert is it not that this THIS is my true temple and the other was but a humble shrine frequented by outcasts
I dont know about outcasts said Robert but you can call this your temple if you like
Hush
the music is beginning
I am not going to tell you about the play
As I said before one cant tell everything and no doubt you saw The Water Babies yourselves
If you did not it was a shame or rather a pity
What I must tell you is that though Cyril and Jane and Robert and Anthea enjoyed it as much as any children possibly could the pleasure of the Phoenix was far far greater than theirs
This is indeed my temple it said again and again
What radiant rites
And all to do honour to me
The songs in the play it took to be hymns in its honour
The choruses were choric songs in its praise
The electric lights it said were magic torches lighted for its sake and it was so charmed with the footlights that the children could hardly persuade it to sit still
But when the limelight was shown it could contain its approval no longer
It flapped its golden wings and cried in a voice that could be heard all over the theatre Well done my servants
Ye have my favour and my countenance
Little Tom on the stage stopped short in what he was saying
A deep breath was drawn by hundreds of lungs every eye in the house turned to the box where the luckless children cringed and most people hissed or said Shish
or Turn them out
Then the play went on and an attendant presently came to the box and spoke wrathfully
It wasnt us indeed it wasnt said Anthea earnestly it was the bird
The man said well then they must keep their bird very quiet
Disturbing every one like this he said
It wont do it again said Robert glancing imploringly at the golden bird Im sure it wont
You have my leave to depart said the Phoenix gently
Well he is a beauty and no mistake said the attendant only Id cover him up during the acts
It upsets the performance
And he went
Dont speak again theres a dear said Anthea you wouldnt like to interfere with your own temple would you
So now the Phoenix was quiet but it kept whispering to the children
It wanted to know why there was no altar no fire no incense and became so excited and fretful and tiresome that four at least of the party of five wished deeply that it had been left at home
What happened next was entirely the fault of the Phoenix
It was not in the least the fault of the theatre people and no one could ever understand afterwards how it did happen
No one that is except the guilty bird itself and the four children
The Phoenix was balancing itself on the gilt back of the chair swaying backwards and forwards and up and down as you may see your own domestic parrot do
I mean the grey one with the red tail
All eyes were on the stage where the lobster was delighting the audience with that gem of a song If you cant walk straight walk sideways
when the Phoenix murmured warmly No altar no fire no incense
and then before any of the children could even begin to think of stopping it it spread its bright wings and swept round the theatre brushing its gleaming feathers against delicate hangings and gilded woodwork
It seemed to have made but one circular wingsweep such as you may see a gull make over grey water on a stormy day
Next moment it was perched again on the chairbackand all round the theatre where it had passed little sparks shone like tinsel seeds then little smoke wreaths curled up like growing plantslittle flames opened like flowerbuds
People whisperedthen people shrieked
Fire
Fire
The curtain went downthe lights went up
Fire
cried every one and made for the doors
A magnificent idea
said the Phoenix complacently
An enormous altarfire supplied free of charge
Doesnt the incense smell delicious
The only smell was the stifling smell of smoke of burning silk or scorching varnish
The little flames had opened now into great flameflowers
The people in the theatre were shouting and pressing towards the doors
Oh how COULD you
cried Jane
Lets get out
Father said stay here said Anthea very pale and trying to speak in her ordinary voice
He didnt mean stay and be roasted said Robert
No boys on burning decks for me thank you
Not much said Cyril and he opened the door of the box
But a fierce waft of smoke and hot air made him shut it again
It was not possible to get out that way
They looked over the front of the box
Could they climb down
It would be possible certainly but would they be much better off
Look at the people moaned Anthea we couldnt get through
And indeed the crowd round the doors looked as thick as flies in the jammaking season
I wish wed never seen the Phoenix cried Jane
Even at that awful moment Robert looked round to see if the bird had overheard a speech which however natural was hardly polite or grateful
The Phoenix was gone
Look here said Cyril Ive read about fires in papers Im sure its all right
Lets wait here as father said
We cant do anything else said Anthea bitterly
Look here said Robert Im NOT frightenedno Im not
The Phoenix has never been a skunk yet and Im certain itll see us through somehow
I believe in the Phoenix
The Phoenix thanks you O Robert said a golden voice at his feet and there was the Phoenix itself on the Wishing Carpet
Quick
it said
Stand on those portions of the carpet which are truly antique and authenticand A sudden jet of flame stopped its words
Alas
the Phoenix had unconsciously warmed to its subject and in the unintentional heat of the moment had set fire to the paraffin with which that morning the children had anointed the carpet
It burned merrily
The children tried in vain to stamp it out
They had to stand back and let it burn itself out
When the paraffin had burned away it was found that it had taken with it all the darns of Scotch heathermixture fingering
Only the fabric of the old carpet was leftand that was full of holes
Come said the Phoenix Im cool now
The four children got on to what was left of the carpet
Very careful they were not to leave a leg or a hand hanging over one of the holes
It was very hotthe theatre was a pit of fire
Every one else had got out
Jane had to sit on Antheas lap
Home
said Cyril and instantly the cool draught from under the nursery door played upon their legs as they sat
They were all on the carpet still and the carpet was lying in its proper place on the nursery floor as calm and unmoved as though it had never been to the theatre or taken part in a fire in its life
Four long breaths of deep relief were instantly breathed
The draught which they had never liked before was for the moment quite pleasant
And they were safe
And every one else was safe
The theatre had been quite empty when they left
Every one was sure of that
They presently found themselves all talking at once
Somehow none of their adventures had given them so much to talk about
None other had seemed so real
Did you notice
they said and Do you remember
When suddenly Antheas face turned pale under the dirt which it had collected on it during the fire
Oh she cried mother and father
Oh how awful
Theyll think were burned to cinders
Oh lets go this minute and tell them we arent
We should only miss them said the sensible Cyril
WellYOU go then said Anthea or I will
Only do wash your face first
Mother will be sure to think you are burnt to a cinder if she sees you as black as that and shell faint or be ill or something
Oh I wish wed never got to know that Phoenix
Hush
said Robert its no use being rude to the bird
I suppose it cant help its nature
Perhaps wed better wash too
Now I come to think of it my hands are rather No one had noticed the Phoenix since it had bidden them to step on the carpet
And no one noticed that no one had noticed
All were partially clean and Cyril was just plunging into his greatcoat to go and look for his parentshe and not unjustly called it looking for a needle in a bundle of haywhen the sound of fathers latchkey in the front door sent every one bounding up the stairs
Are you all safe
cried mothers voice are you all safe
and the next moment she was kneeling on the linoleum of the hall trying to kiss four damp children at once and laughing and crying by turns while father stood looking on and saying he was blessed or something
But how did you guess wed come home said Cyril later when every one was calm enough for talking
Well it was rather a rum thing
We heard the Garrick was on fire and of course we went straight there said father briskly
We couldnt find you of courseand we couldnt get inbut the firemen told us every one was safely out
And then I heard a voice at my ear say Cyril Anthea Robert and Janeand something touched me on the shoulder
It was a great yellow pigeon and it got in the way of my seeing whod spoken
It fluttered off and then some one said in the other ear Theyre safe at home and when I turned again to see who it was speaking hanged if there wasnt that confounded pigeon on my other shoulder
Dazed by the fire I suppose
Your mother said it was the voice of I said it was the bird that spoke said mother and so it was
Or at least I thought so then
It wasnt a pigeon
It was an orangecoloured cockatoo
I dont care who it was that spoke
It was true and youre safe
Mother began to cry again and father said bed was a good place after the pleasures of the stage
So every one went there
Robert had a talk to the Phoenix that night
Oh very well said the bird when Robert had said what he felt didnt you know that I had power over fire
Do not distress yourself
I like my high priests in Lombard Street can undo the work of flames
Kindly open the casement
It flew out
That was why the papers said next day that the fire at the theatre had done less damage than had been anticipated
As a matter of fact it had done none for the Phoenix spent the night in putting things straight
How the management accounted for this and how many of the theatre officials still believe that they were mad on that night will never be known
Next day mother saw the burnt holes in the carpet
It caught where it was paraffiny said Anthea
I must get rid of that carpet at once said mother
But what the children said in sad whispers to each other as they pondered over last nights events was We must get rid of that Phoenix
CHAPTER 12 THE END OF THE END Egg toast tea milk teacup and saucer eggspoon knife butterthats all I think remarked Anthea as she put the last touches to mothers breakfasttray and went very carefully up the stairs feeling for every step with her toes and holding on to the tray with all her fingers
She crept into mothers room and set the tray on a chair
Then she pulled one of the blinds up very softly
Is your head better mammy dear
she asked in the soft little voice that she kept expressly for mothers headaches
Ive brought your brekkie and Ive put the little cloth with cloverleaves on it the one I made you
Thats very nice said mother sleepily
Anthea knew exactly what to do for mothers with headaches who had breakfast in bed
She fetched warm water and put just enough eau de Cologne in it and bathed mothers face and hands with the sweetscented water
Then mother was able to think about breakfast
But whats the matter with my girl
she asked when her eyes got used to the light
Oh Im so sorry youre ill Anthea said
Its that horrible fire and you being so frightened
Father said so
And we all feel as if it was our faults
I cant explain but It wasnt your fault a bit you darling goosie mother said
How could it be
Thats just what I cant tell you said Anthea
I havent got a futile brain like you and father to think of ways of explaining everything
Mother laughed
My futile brainor did you mean fertileanyway it feels very stiff and sore this morningbut I shall be quite all right by and by
And dont be a silly little pet girl
The fire wasnt your faults
No I dont want the egg dear
Ill go to sleep again I think
Dont you worry
And tell cook not to bother me about meals
You can order what you like for lunch
Anthea closed the door very mousily and instantly went downstairs and ordered what she liked for lunch
She ordered a pair of turkeys a large plumpudding cheesecakes and almonds and raisins
Cook told her to go along do
And she might as well not have ordered anything for when lunch came it was just hashed mutton and semolina pudding and cook had forgotten the sippets for the mutton hash and the semolina pudding was burnt
When Anthea rejoined the others she found them all plunged in the gloom where she was herself
For every one knew that the days of the carpet were now numbered
Indeed so worn was it that you could almost have numbered its threads
So that now after nearly a month of magic happenings the time was at hand when life would have to go on in the dull ordinary way and Jane Robert Anthea and Cyril would be just in the same position as the other children who live in Camden Town the children whom these four had so often pitied and perhaps a little despised
We shall be just like them Cyril said
Except said Robert that we shall have more things to remember and be sorry we havent got
Mothers going to send away the carpet as soon as shes well enough to see about that coconut matting
Fancy us with coconutmattingus
And weve walked under live coconuttrees on the island where you cant have whoopingcough
Pretty island said the Lamb paintbox sands and sea all shiny sparkly
His brothers and sisters had often wondered whether he remembered that island
Now they knew that he did
Yes said Cyril no more cheap return trips by carpet for usthats a dead cert
They were all talking about the carpet but what they were all thinking about was the Phoenix
The golden bird had been so kind so friendly so polite so instructiveand now it had set fire to a theatre and made mother ill Nobody blamed the bird
It had acted in a perfectly natural manner
But every one saw that it must not be asked to prolong its visit
Indeed in plain English it must be asked to go
The four children felt like base spies and treacherous friends and each in its mind was saying who ought not to be the one to tell the Phoenix that there could no longer be a place for it in that happy home in Camden Town
Each child was quite sure that one of them ought to speak out in a fair and manly way but nobody wanted to be the one
They could not talk the whole thing over as they would have liked to do because the Phoenix itself was in the cupboard among the blackbeetles and the odd shoes and the broken chessmen
But Anthea tried
Its very horrid
I do hate thinking things about people and not being able to say the things youre thinking because of the way they would feel when they thought what things you were thinking and wondered what theyd done to make you think things like that and why you were thinking them
Anthea was so anxious that the Phoenix should not understand what she said that she made a speech completely baffling to all
It was not till she pointed to the cupboard in which all believed the Phoenix to be that Cyril understood
Yes he said while Jane and Robert were trying to tell each other how deeply they didnt understand what Anthea were saying but after recent eventfulnesses a new leaf has to be turned over and after all mother is more important than the feelings of any of the lower forms of creation however unnatural
How beautifully you do do it said Anthea absently beginning to build a cardhouse for the Lambmixing up what youre saying I mean
We ought to practise doing it so as to be ready for mysterious occasions
Were talking about THAT she said to Jane and Robert frowning and nodding towards the cupboard where the Phoenix was
Then Robert and Jane understood and each opened its mouth to speak
Wait a minute said Anthea quickly the game is to twist up what you want to say so that no one can understand what youre saying except the people you want to understand it and sometimes not them
The ancient philosophers said a golden voice Well understood the art of which you speak
Of course it was the Phoenix who had not been in the cupboard at all but had been cocking a golden eye at them from the cornice during the whole conversation
Pretty dickie
remarked the Lamb
CANARY dickie
Poor misguided infant said the Phoenix
There was a painful pause the four could not but think it likely that the Phoenix had understood their very veiled allusions accompanied as they had been by gestures indicating the cupboard
For the Phoenix was not wanting in intelligence
We were just saying Cyril began and I hope he was not going to say anything but the truth
Whatever it was he did not say it for the Phoenix interrupted him and all breathed more freely as it spoke
I gather it said that you have some tidings of a fatal nature to communicate to our degraded black brothers who run to and fro for ever yonder
It pointed a claw at the cupboard where the blackbeetles lived
Canary TALK said the Lamb joyously go and show mammy
He wriggled off Antheas lap
Mammys asleep said Jane hastily
Come and be wild beasts in a cage under the table
But the Lamb caught his feet and hands and even his head so often and so deeply in the holes of the carpet that the cage or table had to be moved on to the linoleum and the carpet lay bare to sight with all its horrid holes
Ah said the bird it isnt long for this world
No said Robert everything comes to an end
Its awful
Sometimes the end is peace remarked the Phoenix
I imagine that unless it comes soon the end of your carpet will be pieces
Yes said Cyril respectfully kicking what was left of the carpet
The movement of its bright colours caught the eye of the Lamb who went down on all fours instantly and began to pull at the red and blue threads
Aggedydaggedygaggedy murmured the Lamb daggedy ag ag ag
And before any one could have winked even if they had wanted to and it would not have been of the slightest use the middle of the floor showed bare an island of boards surrounded by a sea of linoleum
The magic carpet was gone AND SO WAS THE LAMB
There was a horrible silence
The Lambthe baby all alonehad been wafted away on that untrustworthy carpet so full of holes and magic
And no one could know where he was
And no one could follow him because there was now no carpet to follow on
Jane burst into tears but Anthea though pale and frantic was dryeyed
It MUST be a dream she said
Thats what the clergyman said remarked Robert forlornly but it wasnt and it isnt
But the Lamb never wished said Cyril he was only talking Bosh
The carpet understands all speech said the Phoenix even Bosh
I know not this Boshland but be assured that its tongue is not unknown to the carpet
Do you mean then said Anthea in white terror that when he was saying Agglety dag or whatever it was that he meant something by it
All speech has meaning said the Phoenix
There I think youre wrong said Cyril even people who talk English sometimes say things that dont mean anything in particular
Oh never mind that now moaned Anthea you think Aggety dag meant something to him and the carpet
Beyond doubt it held the same meaning to the carpet as to the luckless infant the Phoenix said calmly
And WHAT did it mean
Oh WHAT
Unfortunately the bird rejoined I never studied Bosh
Jane sobbed noisily but the others were calm with what is sometimes called the calmness of despair
The Lamb was gonethe Lamb their own precious baby brotherwho had never in his happy little life been for a moment out of the sight of eyes that loved himhe was gone
He had gone alone into the great world with no other companion and protector than a carpet with holes in it
The children had never really understood before what an enormously big place the world is
And the Lamb might be anywhere in it
And its no use going to look for him
Cyril in flat and wretched tones only said what the others were thinking
Do you wish him to return
the Phoenix asked it seemed to speak with some surprise
Of course we do
cried everybody
Isnt he more trouble than hes worth
asked the bird doubtfully
No no
Oh we do want him back
We do
Then said the wearer of gold plumage if youll excuse me Ill just pop out and see what I can do
Cyril flung open the window and the Phoenix popped out
Oh if only mother goes on sleeping
Oh suppose she wakes up and wants the Lamb
Oh suppose the servants come
Stop crying Jane
Its no earthly good
No Im not crying myselfat least I wasnt till you said so and I shouldnt anyway ifif there was any mortal thing we could do
Oh oh oh
Cyril and Robert were boys and boys never cry of course
Still the position was a terrible one and I do not wonder that they made faces in their efforts to behave in a really manly way
And at this awful moment mothers bell rang
A breathless stillness held the children
Then Anthea dried her eyes
She looked round her and caught up the poker
She held it out to Cyril
Hit my hand hard she said I must show mother some reason for my eyes being like they are
Harder she cried as Cyril gently tapped her with the iron handle
And Cyril agitated and trembling nerved himself to hit harder and hit very much harder than he intended
Anthea screamed
Oh Panther I didnt mean to hurt really cried Cyril clattering the poker back into the fender
Itsallright said Anthea breathlessly clasping the hurt hand with the one that wasnt hurt itsgettingred
It wasa round red and blue bump was rising on the back of it
Now Robert she said trying to breathe more evenly you go outoh I dont know whereon to the dustbinanywhereand I shall tell mother you and the Lamb are out
Anthea was now ready to deceive her mother for as long as ever she could
Deceit is very wrong we know but it seemed to Anthea that it was her plain duty to keep her mother from being frightened about the Lamb as long as possible
And the Phoenix might help
It always has helped Robert said it got us out of the tower and even when it made the fire in the theatre it got us out all right
Im certain it will manage somehow
Mothers bell rang again
Oh Elizas never answered it cried Anthea she never does
Oh I must go
And she went
Her heart beat bumpingly as she climbed the stairs
Mother would be certain to notice her eyeswell her hand would account for that
But the Lamb No I must NOT think of the Lamb she said to herself and bit her tongue till her eyes watered again so as to give herself something else to think of
Her arms and legs and back and even her tearreddened face felt stiff with her resolution not to let mother be worried if she could help it
She opened the door softly
Yes mother
she said
Dearest said mother the Lamb Anthea tried to be brave
She tried to say that the Lamb and Robert were out
Perhaps she tried too hard
Anyway when she opened her mouth no words came
So she stood with it open
It seemed easier to keep from crying with ones mouth in that unusual position
The Lamb mother went on he was very good at first but hes pulled the toiletcover off the dressingtable with all the brushes and pots and things and now hes so quiet Im sure hes in some dreadful mischief
And I cant see him from here and if Id got out of bed to see Im sure I should have fainted
Do you mean hes HERE
said Anthea
Of course hes here said mother a little impatiently
Where did you think he was
Anthea went round the foot of the big mahogany bed
There was a pause
Hes not here NOW she said
That he had been there was plain from the toiletcover on the floor the scattered pots and bottles the wandering brushes and combs all involved in the tangle of ribbons and laces which an open drawer had yielded to the babys inquisitive fingers
He must have crept out then said mother do keep him with you theres a darling
If I dont get some sleep I shall be a wreck when father comes home
Anthea closed the door softly
Then she tore downstairs and burst into the nursery crying He must have wished he was with mother
Hes been there all the time
Aggety dag The unusual word was frozen on her lip as people say in books
For there on the floor lay the carpet and on the carpet surrounded by his brothers and by Jane sat the Lamb
He had covered his face and clothes with vaseline and violet powder but he was easily recognizable in spite of this disguise
You are right said the Phoenix who was also present it is evident that as you say Aggety dag is Bosh for I want to be where my mother is and so the faithful carpet understood it
But how said Anthea catching up the Lamb and hugging himhow did he get back here
Oh said the Phoenix I flew to the Psammead and wished that your infant brother were restored to your midst and immediately it was so
Oh I am glad I am glad
cried Anthea still hugging the baby
Oh you darling
Shut up Jane
I dont care HOW much he comes off on me
Cyril
You and Robert roll that carpet up and put it in the beetlecupboard
He might say Aggety dag again and it might mean something quite different next time
Now my Lamb Pantherll clean you a little
Come on
I hope the beetles wont go wishing said Cyril as they rolled up the carpet
Two days later mother was well enough to go out and that evening the coconut matting came home
The children had talked and talked and thought and thought but they had not found any polite way of telling the Phoenix that they did not want it to stay any longer
The days had been days spent by the children in embarrassment and by the Phoenix in sleep
And now the matting was laid down the Phoenix awoke and fluttered down on to it
It shook its crested head
I like not this carpet it said it is harsh and unyielding and it hurts my golden feet
Weve jolly well got to get used to its hurting OUR golden feet said Cyril
This then said the bird supersedes the Wishing Carpet
Yes said Robert if you mean that its instead of it
And the magic web
inquired the Phoenix with sudden eagerness
Its the ragandbottle mans day tomorrow said Anthea in a low voice he will take it away
The Phoenix fluttered up to its favourite perch on the chairback
Hear me
it cried oh youthful children of men and restrain your tears of misery and despair for what must be must be and I would not remember you thousands of years hence as base ingrates and crawling worms compact of low selfishness
I should hope not indeed said Cyril
Weep not the bird went on I really do beg that you wont weep
I will not seek to break the news to you gently
Let the blow fall at once
The time has come when I must leave you
All four children breathed forth a long sigh of relief
We neednt have bothered so about how to break the news to it whispered Cyril
Ah sigh not so said the bird gently
All meetings end in partings
I must leave you
I have sought to prepare you for this
Ah do not give way
Must you really goso soon
murmured Anthea
It was what she had often heard her mother say to calling ladies in the afternoon
I must really thank you so much dear replied the bird just as though it had been one of the ladies
I am weary it went on
I desire to restafter all the happenings of this last moon I do desire really to rest and I ask of you one last boon
Any little thing we can do said Robert
Now that it had really come to parting with the Phoenix whose favourite he had always been Robert did feel almost as miserable as the Phoenix thought they all did
I ask but the relic designed for the ragandbottle man
Give me what is left of the carpet and let me go
Dare we
said Anthea
Would mother mind
I have dared greatly for your sakes remarked the bird
Well then we will said Robert
The Phoenix fluffed out its feathers joyously
Nor shall you regret it children of golden hearts it said
Quickspread the carpet and leave me alone but first pile high the fire
Then while I am immersed in the sacred preliminary rites do ye prepare sweetsmelling woods and spices for the last act of parting
The children spread out what was left of the carpet
And after all though this was just what they would have wished to have happened all hearts were sad
Then they put half a scuttle of coal on the fire and went out closing the door on the Phoenixleft at last alone with the carpet
One of us must keep watch said Robert excitedly as soon as they were all out of the room and the others can go and buy sweet woods and spices
Get the very best that money can buy and plenty of them
Dont lets stand to a threepence or so
I want it to have a jolly good sendoff
Its the only thing thatll make us feel less horrid inside
It was felt that Robert as the pet of the Phoenix ought to have the last melancholy pleasure of choosing the materials for its funeral pyre
Ill keep watch if you like said Cyril
I dont mind
And besides its raining hard and my boots let in the wet
You might call and see if my other ones are really reliable again yet
So they left Cyril standing like a Roman sentinel outside the door inside which the Phoenix was getting ready for the great change and they all went out to buy the precious things for the last sad rites
Robert is right Anthea said this is no time for being careful about our money
Lets go to the stationers first and buy a whole packet of leadpencils
Theyre cheaper if you buy them by the packet
This was a thing that they had always wanted to do but it needed the great excitement of a funeral pyre and a parting from a beloved Phoenix to screw them up to the extravagance
The people at the stationers said that the pencils were real cedarwood so I hope they were for stationers should always speak the truth
At any rate they cost oneandfourpence
Also they spent sevenpence threefarthings on a little sandalwood box inlaid with ivory
Because said Anthea I know sandalwood smells sweet and when its burned it smells very sweet indeed
Ivory doesnt smell at all said Robert but I expect when you burn it it smells most awful vile like bones
At the grocers they bought all the spices they could remember the names ofshelllike mace cloves like blunt nails peppercorns the long and the round kind ginger the dry sort of course and the beautiful bloomcovered shells of fragrant cinnamon
Allspice too and caraway seeds caraway seeds that smelt most deadly when the time came for burning them
Camphor and oil of lavender were bought at the chemists and also a little scent sachet labelled Violettes de Parme
They took the things home and found Cyril still on guard
When they had knocked and the golden voice of the Phoenix had said Come in they went in
There lay the carpetor what was left of itand on it lay an egg exactly like the one out of which the Phoenix had been hatched
The Phoenix was walking round and round the egg clucking with joy and pride
Ive laid it you see it said and as fine an egg as ever I laid in all my born days
Every one said yes it was indeed a beauty
The things which the children had bought were now taken out of their papers and arranged on the table and when the Phoenix had been persuaded to leave its egg for a moment and look at the materials for its last fire it was quite overcome
Never never have I had a finer pyre than this will be
You shall not regret it it said wiping away a golden tear
Write quickly Go and tell the Psammead to fulfil the last wish of the Phoenix and return instantly
But Robert wished to be polite and he wrote Please go and ask the Psammead to be so kind as to fulfil the Phoenixs last wish and come straight back if you please
The paper was pinned to the carpet which vanished and returned in the flash of an eye
Then another paper was written ordering the carpet to take the egg somewhere where it wouldnt be hatched for another two thousand years
The Phoenix tore itself away from its cherished egg which it watched with yearning tenderness till the paper being pinned on the carpet hastily rolled itself up round the egg and both vanished for ever from the nursery of the house in Camden Town
Oh dear
oh dear
oh dear
said everybody
Bear up said the bird do you think I dont suffer being parted from my precious newlaid egg like this
Come conquer your emotions and build my fire
OH
cried Robert suddenly and wholly breaking down I cant BEAR you to go
The Phoenix perched on his shoulder and rubbed its beak softly against his ear
The sorrows of youth soon appear but as dreams it said
Farewell Robert of my heart
I have loved you well
The fire had burnt to a red glow
One by one the spices and sweet woods were laid on it
Some smelt nice and somethe caraway seeds and the Violettes de Parme sachet among themsmelt worse than you would think possible
Farewell farewell farewell farewell
said the Phoenix in a faraway voice
Oh GOODBYE said every one and now all were in tears
The bright bird fluttered seven times round the room and settled in the hot heart of the fire
The sweet gums and spices and woods flared and flickered around it but its golden feathers did not burn
It seemed to grow redhot to the very inside heart of itand then before the eight eyes of its friends it fell together a heap of white ashes and the flames of the cedar pencils and the sandalwood box met and joined above it
Whatever have you done with the carpet
asked mother next day
We gave it to some one who wanted it very much
The name began with a P said Jane
The others instantly hushed her
Oh well it wasnt worth twopence said mother
The person who began with P said we shouldnt lose by it Jane went on before she could be stopped
I daresay
said mother laughing
But that very night a great box came addressed to the children by all their names
Eliza never could remember the name of the carrier who brought it
It wasnt Carter Paterson or the Parcels Delivery
It was instantly opened
It was a big wooden box and it had to be opened with a hammer and the kitchen poker the long nails came squeaking out and boards scrunched as they were wrenched off
Inside the box was soft paper with beautiful Chinese patterns on itblue and green and red and violet
And under the paperwell almost everything lovely that you can think of
Everything of reasonable size I mean for of course there were no motors or flying machines or thoroughbred chargers
But there really was almost everything else
Everything that the children had always wantedtoys and games and books and chocolate and candied cherries and paintboxes and photographic cameras and all the presents they had always wanted to give to father and mother and the Lamb only they had never had the money for them
At the very bottom of the box was a tiny golden feather
No one saw it but Robert and he picked it up and hid it in the breast of his jacket which had been so often the nestingplace of the golden bird
When he went to bed the feather was gone
It was the last he ever saw of the Phoenix
Pinned to the lovely fur cloak that mother had always wanted was a paper and it said In return for the carpet
With gratitudeP
You may guess how father and mother talked it over
They decided at last the person who had had the carpet and whom curiously enough the children were quite unable to describe must be an insane millionaire who amused himself by playing at being a ragandbone man
But the children knew better
They knew that this was the fulfilment by the powerful Psammead of the last wish of the Phoenix and that this glorious and delightful boxful of treasures was really the very very very end of the Phoenix and the Carpet
