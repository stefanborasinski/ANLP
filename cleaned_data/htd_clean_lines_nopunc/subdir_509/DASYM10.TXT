DAISY MILLER A STUDY IN TWO PARTS PART I At the little town of Vevey in Switzerland there is a particularly comfortable hotel
There are indeed many hotels for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place which as many travelers will remember is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lakea lake that it behooves every tourist to visit
The shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order of every category from the grand hotel of the newest fashion with a chalkwhite front a hundred balconies and a dozen flags flying from its roof to the little Swiss pension of an elder day with its name inscribed in Germanlooking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden
One of the hotels at Vevey however is famous even classical being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity
In this region in the month of June American travelers are extremely numerous it may be said indeed that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place
There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision an echo of Newport and Saratoga
There is a flitting hither and thither of stylish young girls a rustling of muslin flounces a rattle of dance music in the morning hours a sound of highpitched voices at all times
You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the Trois Couronnes and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall
But at the Trois Couronnes it must be added there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions neat German waiters who look like secretaries of legation Russian princesses sitting in the garden little Polish boys walking about held by the hand with their governors a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon
I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American who two or three years ago sat in the garden of the Trois Couronnes looking about him rather idly at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned
It was a beautiful summer morning and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things they must have seemed to him charming
He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer to see his aunt who was staying at the hotelGeneva having been for a long time his place of residence
But his aunt had a headache his aunt had almost always a headacheand now she was shut up in her room smelling camphor so that he was at liberty to wander about
He was some sevenandtwenty years of age when his friends spoke of him they usually said that he was at Geneva studying
When his enemies spoke of him they saidbut after all he had no enemies he was an extremely amiable fellow and universally liked
What I should say is simply that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived therea foreign ladya person older than himself
Very few Americansindeed I think nonehad ever seen this lady about whom there were some singular stories
But Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism he had been put to school there as a boy and he had afterward gone to college therecircumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships
Many of these he had kept and they were a source of great satisfaction to him
After knocking at his aunts door and learning that she was indisposed he had taken a walk about the town and then he had come in to his breakfast
He had now finished his breakfast but he was drinking a small cup of coffee which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache
At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette
Presently a small boy came walking along the pathan urchin of nine or ten
The child who was diminutive for his years had an aged expression of countenance a pale complexion and sharp little features
He was dressed in knickerbockers with red stockings which displayed his poor little spindleshanks he also wore a brilliant red cravat
He carried in his hand a long alpenstock the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approachedthe flowerbeds the garden benches the trains of the ladies dresses
In front of Winterbourne he paused looking at him with a pair of bright penetrating little eyes
Will you give me a lump of sugar
he asked in a sharp hard little voice a voice immature and yet somehow not young
Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him on which his coffee service rested and saw that several morsels of sugar remained
Yes you may take one he answered but I dont think sugar is good for little boys
This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers depositing the other as promptly in another place
He poked his alpenstock lancefashion into Winterbournes bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth
Oh blazes its harrd
he exclaimed pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner
Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman
Take care you dont hurt your teeth he said paternally
I havent got any teeth to hurt
They have all come out
I have only got seven teeth
My mother counted them last night and one came out right afterward
She said shed slap me if any more came out
I cant help it
Its this old Europe
Its the climate that makes them come out
In America they didnt come out
Its these hotels
Winterbourne was much amused
If you eat three lumps of sugar your mother will certainly slap you he said
Shes got to give me some candy then rejoined his young interlocutor
I cant get any candy hereany American candy
American candys the best candy
And are American little boys the best little boys
asked Winterbourne
I dont know
Im an American boy said the child
I see you are one of the best
laughed Winterbourne
Are you an American man
pursued this vivacious infant
And then on Winterbournes affirmative replyAmerican men are the best he declared
His companion thanked him for the compliment and the child who had now got astride of his alpenstock stood looking about him while he attacked a second lump of sugar
Winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy for he had been brought to Europe at about this age
Here comes my sister
cried the child in a moment
Shes an American girl
Winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing
American girls are the best girls he said cheerfully to his young companion
My sister aint the best
the child declared
Shes always blowing at me
I imagine that is your fault not hers said Winterbourne
The young lady meanwhile had drawn near
She was dressed in white muslin with a hundred frills and flounces and knots of palecolored ribbon
She was bareheaded but she balanced in her hand a large parasol with a deep border of embroidery and she was strikingly admirably pretty
How pretty they are
thought Winterbourne straightening himself in his seat as if he were prepared to rise
The young lady paused in front of his bench near the parapet of the garden which overlooked the lake
The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little
Randolph said the young lady what ARE you doing
Im going up the Alps replied Randolph
This is the way
And he gave another little jump scattering the pebbles about Winterbournes ears
Thats the way they come down said Winterbourne
Hes an American man
cried Randolph in his little hard voice
The young lady gave no heed to this announcement but looked straight at her brother
Well I guess you had better be quiet she simply observed
It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented
He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl throwing away his cigarette
This little boy and I have made acquaintance he said with great civility
In Geneva as he had been perfectly aware a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions but here at Vevey what conditions could be better than these a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden
This pretty American girl however on hearing Winterbournes observation simply glanced at him she then turned her head and looked over the parapet at the lake and the opposite mountains
He wondered whether he had gone too far but he decided that he must advance farther rather than retreat
While he was thinking of something else to say the young lady turned to the little boy again
I should like to know where you got that pole she said
I bought it responded Randolph
You dont mean to say youre going to take it to Italy
Yes I am going to take it to Italy the child declared
The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon
Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again
Well I guess you had better leave it somewhere she said after a moment
Are you going to Italy
Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect
The young lady glanced at him again
Yes sir she replied
And she said nothing more
Are youa going over the Simplon
Winterbourne pursued a little embarrassed
I dont know she said
I suppose its some mountain
Randolph what mountain are we going over
Going where
the child demanded
To Italy Winterbourne explained
I dont know said Randolph
I dont want to go to Italy
I want to go to America
Oh Italy is a beautiful place
rejoined the young man
Can you get candy there
Randolph loudly inquired
I hope not said his sister
I guess you have had enough candy and mother thinks so too
I havent had any for ever so longfor a hundred weeks
cried the boy still jumping about
The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view
He was ceasing to be embarrassed for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself
There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion she was evidently neither offended nor flattered
If she looked another way when he spoke to her and seemed not particularly to hear him this was simply her habit her manner
Yet as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view with which she appeared quite unacquainted she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking
It was not however what would have been called an immodest glance for the young girls eyes were singularly honest and fresh
They were wonderfully pretty eyes and indeed Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywomans various featuresher complexion her nose her ears her teeth
He had a great relish for feminine beauty he was addicted to observing and analyzing it and as regards this young ladys face he made several observations
It was not at all insipid but it was not exactly expressive and though it was eminently delicate Winterbourne mentally accused itvery forgivinglyof a want of finish
He thought it very possible that Master Randolphs sister was a coquette he was sure she had a spirit of her own but in her bright sweet superficial little visage there was no mockery no irony
Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation
She told him that they were going to Rome for the wintershe and her mother and Randolph
She asked him if he was a real American she shouldnt have taken him for one he seemed more like a Germanthis was said after a little hesitation especially when he spoke
Winterbourne laughing answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans but that he had not so far as he remembered met an American who spoke like a German
Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted
She answered that she liked standing up and walking about but she presently sat down
She told him she was from New York Stateif you know where that is
Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side
Tell me your name my boy he said
Randolph C Miller said the boy sharply
And Ill tell you her name and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister
You had better wait till you are asked
said this young lady calmly
I should like very much to know your name said Winterbourne
Her name is Daisy Miller
cried the child
But that isnt her real name that isnt her name on her cards
Its a pity you havent got one of my cards
said Miss Miller
Her real name is Annie P Miller the boy went on
Ask him HIS name said his sister indicating Winterbourne
But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent he continued to supply information with regard to his own family
My fathers name is Ezra B Miller he announced
My father aint in Europe my fathers in a better place than Europe
Winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that Mr Miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward
But Randolph immediately added My fathers in Schenectady
Hes got a big business
My fathers rich you bet
Well
ejaculated Miss Miller lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border
Winterbourne presently released the child who departed dragging his alpenstock along the path
He doesnt like Europe said the young girl
He wants to go back
To Schenectady you mean
Yes he wants to go right home
He hasnt got any boys here
There is one boy here but he always goes round with a teacher they wont let him play
And your brother hasnt any teacher
Winterbourne inquired
Mother thought of getting him one to travel round with us
There was a lady told her of a very good teacher an American ladyperhaps you know herMrs Sanders
I think she came from Boston
She told her of this teacher and we thought of getting him to travel round with us
But Randolph said he didnt want a teacher traveling round with us
He said he wouldnt have lessons when he was in the cars
And we ARE in the cars about half the time
There was an English lady we met in the carsI think her name was Miss Featherstone perhaps you know her
She wanted to know why I didnt give Randolph lessonsgive him instruction she called it
I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give him
Hes very smart
Yes said Winterbourne he seems very smart
Mothers going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy
Can you get good teachers in Italy
Very good I should think said Winterbourne
Or else shes going to find some school
He ought to learn some more
Hes only nine
Hes going to college
And in this way Miss Miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics
She sat there with her extremely pretty hands ornamented with very brilliant rings folded in her lap and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of Winterbourne now wandering over the garden the people who passed by and the beautiful view
She talked to Winterbourne as if she had known him a long time
He found it very pleasant
It was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much
It might have been said of this unknown young lady who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench that she chattered
She was very quiet she sat in a charming tranquil attitude but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving
She had a soft slender agreeable voice and her tone was decidedly sociable
She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother in Europe and enumerated in particular the various hotels at which they had stopped
That English lady in the cars she saidMiss Featherstone asked me if we didnt all live in hotels in America
I told her I had never been in so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe
I have never seen so manyits nothing but hotels
But Miss Miller did not make this remark with a querulous accent she appeared to be in the best humor with everything
She declared that the hotels were very good when once you got used to their ways and that Europe was perfectly sweet
She was not disappointednot a bit
Perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before
She had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times
And then she had had ever so many dresses and things from Paris
Whenever she put on a Paris dress she felt as if she were in Europe
It was a kind of a wishing cap said Winterbourne
Yes said Miss Miller without examining this analogy it always made me wish I was here
But I neednt have done that for dresses
I am sure they send all the pretty ones to America you see the most frightful things here
The only thing I dont like she proceeded is the society
There isnt any society or if there is I dont know where it keeps itself
Do you
I suppose there is some society somewhere but I havent seen anything of it
Im very fond of society and I have always had a great deal of it
I dont mean only in Schenectady but in New York
I used to go to New York every winter
In New York I had lots of society
Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me and three of them were by gentlemen added Daisy Miller
I have more friends in New York than in Schenectady more gentleman friends and more young lady friends too she resumed in a moment
She paused again for an instant she was looking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light slightly monotonous smile
I have always had she said a great deal of gentlemens society
Poor Winterbourne was amused perplexed and decidedly charmed
He had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion never at least save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment
And yet was he to accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite as they said at Geneva
He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had lost a good deal he had become dishabituated to the American tone
Never indeed since he had grown old enough to appreciate things had he encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this
Certainly she was very charming but how deucedly sociable
Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State
Were they all like that the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemens society
Or was she also a designing an audacious an unscrupulous young person
Winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter and his reason could not help him
Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent
Some people had told him that after all American girls were exceedingly innocent and others had told him that after all they were not
He was inclined to think Miss Daisy Miller was a flirta pretty American flirt
He had never as yet had any relations with young ladies of this category
He had known here in Europe two or three womenpersons older than Miss Daisy Miller and provided for respectabilitys sake with husbandswho were great coquettesdangerous terrible women with whom ones relations were liable to take a serious turn
But this young girl was not a coquette in that sense she was very unsophisticated she was only a pretty American flirt
Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller
He leaned back in his seat he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of ones intercourse with a pretty American flirt
It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn
Have you been to that old castle
asked the young girl pointing with her parasol to the fargleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon
Yes formerly more than once said Winterbourne
You too I suppose have seen it
No we havent been there
I want to go there dreadfully
Of course I mean to go there
I wouldnt go away from here without having seen that old castle
Its a very pretty excursion said Winterbourne and very easy to make
You can drive you know or you can go by the little steamer
You can go in the cars said Miss Miller
Yes you can go in the cars Winterbourne assented
Our courier says they take you right up to the castle the young girl continued
We were going last week but my mother gave out
She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia
She said she couldnt go
Randolph wouldnt go either he says he doesnt think much of old castles
But I guess well go this week if we can get Randolph
Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments
Winterbourne inquired smiling
He says he dont care much about old castles
Hes only nine
He wants to stay at the hotel
Mothers afraid to leave him alone and the courier wont stay with him so we havent been to many places
But it will be too bad if we dont go up there
And Miss Miller pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon
I should think it might be arranged said Winterbourne
Couldnt you get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph
Miss Miller looked at him a moment and then very placidly I wish YOU would stay with him
she said
Winterbourne hesitated a moment
I should much rather go to Chillon with you
With me
asked the young girl with the same placidity
She didnt rise blushing as a young girl at Geneva would have done and yet Winterbourne conscious that he had been very bold thought it possible she was offended
With your mother he answered very respectfully
But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss Daisy Miller
I guess my mother wont go after all she said
She dont like to ride round in the afternoon
But did you really mean what you said just nowthat you would like to go up there
Most earnestly Winterbourne declared
Then we may arrange it
If mother will stay with Randolph I guess Eugenio will
Eugenio
the young man inquired
Eugenios our courier
He doesnt like to stay with Randolph hes the most fastidious man I ever saw
But hes a splendid courier
I guess hell stay at home with Randolph if mother does and then we can go to the castle
Winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible we could only mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself
This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence he felt as if he ought to kiss the young ladys hand
Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project but at this moment another person presumably Eugenio appeared
A tall handsome man with superb whiskers wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain approached Miss Miller looking sharply at her companion
Oh Eugenio
said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent
Eugenio had looked at Winterbourne from head to foot he now bowed gravely to the young lady
I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table
Miss Miller slowly rose
See here Eugenio
she said Im going to that old castle anyway
To the Chateau de Chillon mademoiselle
the courier inquired
Mademoiselle has made arrangements
he added in a tone which struck Winterbourne as very impertinent
Eugenios tone apparently threw even to Miss Millers own apprehension a slightly ironical light upon the young girls situation
She turned to Winterbourne blushing a littlea very little
You wont back out
she said
I shall not be happy till we go
he protested
And you are staying in this hotel
she went on
And you are really an American
The courier stood looking at Winterbourne offensively
The young man at least thought his manner of looking an offense to Miss Miller it conveyed an imputation that she picked up acquaintances
I shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me he said smiling and referring to his aunt
Oh well well go some day said Miss Miller
And she gave him a smile and turned away
She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside Eugenio
Winterbourne stood looking after her and as she moved away drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess
He had however engaged to do more than proved feasible in promising to present his aunt Mrs Costello to Miss Daisy Miller
As soon as the former lady had got better of her headache he waited upon her in her apartment and after the proper inquiries in regard to her health he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an American familya mamma a daughter and a little boy
And a courier
said Mrs Costello
Oh yes I have observed them
Seen themheard themand kept out of their way
Mrs Costello was a widow with a fortune a person of much distinction who frequently intimated that if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time
She had a long pale face a high nose and a great deal of very striking white hair which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head
She had two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe
This young man was amusing himself at Hamburg and though he was on his travels was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there
Her nephew who had come up to Vevey expressly to see her was therefore more attentive than those who as she said were nearer to her
He had imbibed at Geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to ones aunt
Mrs Costello had not seen him for many years and she was greatly pleased with him manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which as she gave him to understand she exerted in the American capital
She admitted that she was very exclusive but if he were acquainted with New York he would see that one had to be
And her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city which she presented to him in many different lights was to Winterbournes imagination almost oppressively striking
He immediately perceived from her tone that Miss Daisy Millers place in the social scale was low
I am afraid you dont approve of them he said
They are very common Mrs Costello declared
They are the sort of Americans that one does ones duty by notnot accepting
Ah you dont accept them
said the young man
I cant my dear Frederick
I would if I could but I cant
The young girl is very pretty said Winterbourne in a moment
Of course shes pretty
But she is very common
I see what you mean of course said Winterbourne after another pause
She has that charming look that they all have his aunt resumed
I cant think where they pick it up and she dresses in perfectionno you dont know how well she dresses
I cant think where they get their taste
But my dear aunt she is not after all a Comanche savage
She is a young lady said Mrs Costello who has an intimacy with her mammas courier
An intimacy with the courier
the young man demanded
Oh the mother is just as bad
They treat the courier like a familiar friendlike a gentleman
I shouldnt wonder if he dines with them
Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners such fine clothes so like a gentleman
He probably corresponds to the young ladys idea of a count
He sits with them in the garden in the evening
I think he smokes
Winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures they helped him to make up his mind about Miss Daisy
Evidently she was rather wild
Well he said I am not a courier and yet she was very charming to me
You had better have said at first said Mrs Costello with dignity that you had made her acquaintance
We simply met in the garden and we talked a bit
Tout bonnement
And pray what did you say
I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt
I am much obliged to you
It was to guarantee my respectability said Winterbourne
And pray who is to guarantee hers
Ah you are cruel
said the young man
Shes a very nice young girl
You dont say that as if you believed it Mrs Costello observed
She is completely uncultivated Winterbourne went on
But she is wonderfully pretty and in short she is very nice
To prove that I believe it I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon
You two are going off there together
I should say it proved just the contrary
How long had you known her may I ask when this interesting project was formed
You havent been twentyfour hours in the house
I have known her half an hour
said Winterbourne smiling
Dear me
cried Mrs Costello
What a dreadful girl
Her nephew was silent for some moments
You really think then he began earnestly and with a desire for trustworthy informationyou really think that But he paused again
Think what sir
said his aunt
That she is the sort of young lady who expects a man sooner or later to carry her off
I havent the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do
But I really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls that are uncultivated as you call them
You have lived too long out of the country
You will be sure to make some great mistake
You are too innocent
My dear aunt I am not so innocent said Winterbourne smiling and curling his mustache
You are guilty too then
Winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively
You wont let the poor girl know you then
he asked at last
Is it literally true that she is going to the Chateau de Chillon with you
I think that she fully intends it
Then my dear Frederick said Mrs Costello I must decline the honor of her acquaintance
I am an old woman but I am not too old thank Heaven to be shocked
But dont they all do these thingsthe young girls in America
Winterbourne inquired
Mrs Costello stared a moment
I should like to see my granddaughters do them
she declared grimly
This seemed to throw some light upon the matter for Winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were tremendous flirts
If therefore Miss Daisy Miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies it was probable that anything might be expected of her
Winterbourne was impatient to see her again and he was vexed with himself that by instinct he should not appreciate her justly
Though he was impatient to see her he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunts refusal to become acquainted with her but he discovered promptly enough that with Miss Daisy Miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe
He found her that evening in the garden wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld
It was ten oclock
He had dined with his aunt had been sitting with her since dinner and had just taken leave of her till the morrow
Miss Daisy Miller seemed very glad to see him she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed
Have you been all alone
he asked
I have been walking round with mother
But mother gets tired walking round she answered
Has she gone to bed
No she doesnt like to go to bed said the young girl
She doesnt sleepnot three hours
She says she doesnt know how she lives
Shes dreadfully nervous
I guess she sleeps more than she thinks
Shes gone somewhere after Randolph she wants to try to get him to go to bed
He doesnt like to go to bed
Let us hope she will persuade him observed Winterbourne
She will talk to him all she can but he doesnt like her to talk to him said Miss Daisy opening her fan
Shes going to try to get Eugenio to talk to him
But he isnt afraid of Eugenio
Eugenios a splendid courier but he cant make much impression on Randolph
I dont believe hell go to bed before eleven
It appeared that Randolphs vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged for Winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother
I have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to his companion resumed
Shes your aunt
Then on Winterbournes admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it she said she had heard all about Mrs Costello from the chambermaid
She was very quiet and very comme il faut she wore white puffs she spoke to no one and she never dined at the table dhote
Every two days she had a headache
I think thats a lovely description headache and all
said Miss Daisy chattering along in her thin gay voice
I want to know her ever so much
I know just what YOUR aunt would be I know I should like her
She would be very exclusive
I like a lady to be exclusive Im dying to be exclusive myself
Well we ARE exclusive mother and I
We dont speak to everyoneor they dont speak to us
I suppose its about the same thing
Anyway I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt
Winterbourne was embarrassed
She would be most happy he said but I am afraid those headaches will interfere
The young girl looked at him through the dusk
But I suppose she doesnt have a headache every day she said sympathetically
Winterbourne was silent a moment
She tells me she does he answered at last not knowing what to say
Miss Daisy Miller stopped and stood looking at him
Her prettiness was still visible in the darkness she was opening and closing her enormous fan
She doesnt want to know me
she said suddenly
Why dont you say so
You neednt be afraid
Im not afraid
And she gave a little laugh
Winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice he was touched shocked mortified by it
My dear young lady he protested she knows no one
Its her wretched health
The young girl walked on a few steps laughing still
You neednt be afraid she repeated
Why should she want to know me
Then she paused again she was close to the parapet of the garden and in front of her was the starlit lake
There was a vague sheen upon its surface and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms
Daisy Miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh
Gracious
she IS exclusive
she said
Winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her
He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes
He felt then for the instant quite ready to sacrifice his aunt conversationally to admit that she was a proud rude woman and to declare that they neednt mind her
But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety the young lady resuming her walk gave an exclamation in quite another tone
Well heres Mother
I guess she hasnt got Randolph to go to bed
The figure of a lady appeared at a distance very indistinct in the darkness and advancing with a slow and wavering movement
Suddenly it seemed to pause
Are you sure it is your mother
Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk
Winterbourne asked
Well
cried Miss Daisy Miller with a laugh I guess I know my own mother
And when she has got on my shawl too
She is always wearing my things
The lady in question ceasing to advance hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps
I am afraid your mother doesnt see you said Winterbourne
Or perhaps he added thinking with Miss Miller the joke permissibleperhaps she feels guilty about your shawl
Oh its a fearful old thing
the young girl replied serenely
I told her she could wear it
She wont come here because she sees you
Ah then said Winterbourne I had better leave you
Oh no come on
urged Miss Daisy Miller
Im afraid your mother doesnt approve of my walking with you
Miss Miller gave him a serious glance
It isnt for me its for youthat is its for HER
Well I dont know who its for
But mother doesnt like any of my gentlemen friends
Shes right down timid
She always makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman
But I DO introduce themalmost always
If I didnt introduce my gentlemen friends to Mother the young girl added in her little soft flat monotone I shouldnt think I was natural
To introduce me said Winterbourne you must know my name
And he proceeded to pronounce it
Oh dear I cant say all that
said his companion with a laugh
But by this time they had come up to Mrs Miller who as they drew near walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them
Mother
said the young girl in a tone of decision
Upon this the elder lady turned round
Mr Winterbourne said Miss Daisy Miller introducing the young man very frankly and prettily
Common she was as Mrs Costello had pronounced her yet it was a wonder to Winterbourne that with her commonness she had a singularly delicate grace
Her mother was a small spare light person with a wandering eye a very exiguous nose and a large forehead decorated with a certain amount of thin much frizzled hair
Like her daughter Mrs Miller was dressed with extreme elegance she had enormous diamonds in her ears
So far as Winterbourne could observe she gave him no greetingshe certainly was not looking at him
Daisy was near her pulling her shawl straight
What are you doing poking round here
this young lady inquired but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply
I dont know said her mother turning toward the lake again
I shouldnt think youd want that shawl
Daisy exclaimed
Well I do
her mother answered with a little laugh
Did you get Randolph to go to bed
asked the young girl
No I couldnt induce him said Mrs Miller very gently
He wants to talk to the waiter
He likes to talk to that waiter
I was telling Mr Winterbourne the young girl went on and to the young mans ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life
Oh yes
said Winterbourne I have the pleasure of knowing your son
Randolphs mamma was silent she turned her attention to the lake
But at last she spoke
Well I dont see how he lives
Anyhow it isnt so bad as it was at Dover said Daisy Miller
And what occurred at Dover
Winterbourne asked
He wouldnt go to bed at all
I guess he sat up all night in the public parlor
He wasnt in bed at twelve oclock I know that
It was halfpast twelve declared Mrs Miller with mild emphasis
Does he sleep much during the day
Winterbourne demanded
I guess he doesnt sleep much Daisy rejoined
I wish he would
said her mother
It seems as if he couldnt
I think hes real tiresome Daisy pursued
Then for some moments there was silence
Well Daisy Miller said the elder lady presently I shouldnt think youd want to talk against your own brother
Well he IS tiresome Mother said Daisy quite without the asperity of a retort
Hes only nine urged Mrs Miller
Well he wouldnt go to that castle said the young girl
Im going there with Mr
Winterbourne
To this announcement very placidly made Daisys mamma offered no response
Winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion but he said to himself that she was a simple easily managed person and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure
Yes he began your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide
Mrs Millers wandering eyes attached themselves with a sort of appealing air to Daisy who however strolled a few steps farther gently humming to herself
I presume you will go in the cars said her mother
Yes or in the boat said Winterbourne
Well of course I dont know Mrs Miller rejoined
I have never been to that castle
It is a pity you shouldnt go said Winterbourne beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition
And yet he was quite prepared to find that as a matter of course she meant to accompany her daughter
Weve been thinking ever so much about going she pursued but it seems as if we couldnt
Of course Daisyshe wants to go round
But theres a lady hereI dont know her name she says she shouldnt think wed want to go to see castles HERE she should think wed want to wait till we got to Italy
It seems as if there would be so many there continued Mrs Miller with an air of increasing confidence
Of course we only want to see the principal ones
We visited several in England she presently added
Ah yes
in England there are beautiful castles said Winterbourne
But Chillon here is very well worth seeing
Well if Daisy feels up to it said Mrs Miller in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise
It seems as if there was nothing she wouldnt undertake
Oh I think shell enjoy it
Winterbourne declared
And he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a teteatete with the young lady who was still strolling along in front of them softly vocalizing
You are not disposed madam he inquired to undertake it yourself
Daisys mother looked at him an instant askance and then walked forward in silence
ThenI guess she had better go alone she said simply
Winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake
But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by Mrs Millers unprotected daughter
Mr
Winterbourne
murmured Daisy
Mademoiselle
said the young man
Dont you want to take me out in a boat
At present
he asked
Of course
said Daisy
Well Annie Miller
exclaimed her mother
I beg you madam to let her go said Winterbourne ardently for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl
I shouldnt think shed want to said her mother
I should think shed rather go indoors
Im sure Mr Winterbourne wants to take me Daisy declared
Hes so awfully devoted
I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight
I dont believe it
said Daisy
Well
ejaculated the elder lady again
You havent spoken to me for half an hour her daughter went on
I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother said Winterbourne
Well I want you to take me out in a boat
Daisy repeated
They had all stopped and she had turned round and was looking at Winterbourne
Her face wore a charming smile her pretty eyes were gleaming she was swinging her great fan about
No its impossible to be prettier than that thought Winterbourne
There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place he said pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake
If you will do me the honor to accept my arm we will go and select one of them
Daisy stood there smiling she threw back her head and gave a little light laugh
I like a gentleman to be formal
she declared
I assure you its a formal offer
I was bound I would make you say something Daisy went on
You see its not very difficult said Winterbourne
But I am afraid you are chaffing me
I think not sir remarked Mrs Miller very gently
Do then let me give you a row he said to the young girl
Its quite lovely the way you say that
cried Daisy
It will be still more lovely to do it
Yes it would be lovely
said Daisy
But she made no movement to accompany him she only stood there laughing
I should think you had better find out what time it is interposed her mother
It is eleven oclock madam said a voice with a foreign accent out of the neighboring darkness and Winterbourne turning perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies
He had apparently just approached
Oh Eugenio said Daisy I am going out in a boat
Eugenio bowed
At eleven oclock mademoiselle
I am going with Mr Winterbournethis very minute
Do tell her she cant said Mrs Miller to the courier
I think you had better not go out in a boat mademoiselle Eugenio declared
Winterbourne wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier but he said nothing
I suppose you dont think its proper
Daisy exclaimed
Eugenio doesnt think anythings proper
I am at your service said Winterbourne
Does mademoiselle propose to go alone
asked Eugenio of Mrs Miller
Oh no with this gentleman
answered Daisys mamma
The courier looked for a moment at Winterbournethe latter thought he was smilingand then solemnly with a bow As mademoiselle pleases
he said
Oh I hoped you would make a fuss
said Daisy
I dont care to go now
I myself shall make a fuss if you dont go said Winterbourne
Thats all I wanta little fuss
And the young girl began to laugh again
Mr Randolph has gone to bed
the courier announced frigidly
Oh Daisy now we can go
said Mrs Miller
Daisy turned away from Winterbourne looking at him smiling and fanning herself
Good night she said I hope you are disappointed or disgusted or something
He looked at her taking the hand she offered him
I am puzzled he answered
Well I hope it wont keep you awake
she said very smartly and under the escort of the privileged Eugenio the two ladies passed toward the house
Winterbourne stood looking after them he was indeed puzzled
He lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour turning over the mystery of the young girls sudden familiarities and caprices
But the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly going off with her somewhere
Two days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon
He waited for her in the large hall of the hotel where the couriers the servants the foreign tourists were lounging about and staring
It was not the place he should have chosen but she had appointed it
She came tripping downstairs buttoning her long gloves squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume
Winterbourne was a man of imagination and as our ancestors used to say sensibility as he looked at her dress and on the great staircase her little rapid confiding step he felt as if there were something romantic going forward
He could have believed he was going to elope with her
He passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there they were all looking at her very hard she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him
Winterbournes preference had been that they should be conveyed to Chillon in a carriage but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer she declared that she had a passion for steamboats
There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water and you saw such lots of people
The sail was not long but Winterbournes companion found time to say a great many things
To the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapadean adventure that even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way
But it must be confessed that in this particular he was disappointed
Daisy Miller was extremely animated she was in charming spirits but she was apparently not at all excited she was not fluttered she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her
People continued to look at her a great deal and Winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companions distinguished air
He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud laugh overmuch and even perhaps desire to move about the boat a good deal
But he quite forgot his fears he sat smiling with his eyes upon her face while without moving from her place she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections
It was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard
he had assented to the idea that she was common but was she so after all or was he simply getting used to her commonness
Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast but every now and then it took a subjective turn
What on EARTH are you so grave about
she suddenly demanded fixing her agreeable eyes upon Winterbournes
Am I grave
he asked
I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear
You look as if you were taking me to a funeral
If thats a grin your ears are very near together
Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck
Pray do and Ill carry round your hat
It will pay the expenses of our journey
I never was better pleased in my life murmured Winterbourne
She looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh
I like to make you say those things
Youre a queer mixture
In the castle after they had landed the subjective element decidedly prevailed
Daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes and turned a singularly wellshaped ear to everything that Winterbourne told her about the place
But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon her
They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian and Winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried that they should linger and pause wherever they chose
The custodian interpreted the bargain generouslyWinterbourne on his side had been generousand ended by leaving them quite to themselves
Miss Millers observations were not remarkable for logical consistency for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext
She found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking Winterbourne sudden questions about himselfhis family his previous history his tastes his habits his intentionsand for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality
Of her own tastes habits and intentions Miss Miller was prepared to give the most definite and indeed the most favorable account
Well I hope you know enough
she said to her companion after he had told her the history of the unhappy Bonivard
I never saw a man that knew so much
The history of Bonivard had evidently as they say gone into one ear and out of the other
But Daisy went on to say that she wished Winterbourne would travel with them and go round with them they might know something in that case
Dont you want to come and teach Randolph
she asked
Winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much but that he unfortunately other occupations
Other occupations
I dont believe it
said Miss Daisy
What do you mean
You are not in business
The young man admitted that he was not in business but he had engagements which even within a day or two would force him to go back to Geneva
Oh bother
she said I dont believe it
and she began to talk about something else
But a few moments later when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace she broke out irrelevantly You dont mean to say you are going back to Geneva
It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva tomorrow
Well Mr Winterbourne said Daisy I think youre horrid
Oh dont say such dreadful things
said Winterbournejust at the last
The last
cried the young girl I call it the first
I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone
And for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid
Poor Winterbourne was fairly bewildered no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements
His companion after this ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the beauties of the lake she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see
How did Miss Daisy Miller know that there was a charmer in Geneva
Winterbourne who denied the existence of such a person was quite unable to discover and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage
She seemed to him in all this an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity
Does she never allow you more than three days at a time
asked Daisy ironically
Doesnt she give you a vacation in summer
Theres no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season
I suppose if you stay another day shell come after you in the boat
Do wait over till Friday and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive
Winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked
If he had missed the personal accent the personal accent was now making its appearance
It sounded very distinctly at last in her telling him she would stop teasing him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in the winter
Thats not a difficult promise to make said Winterbourne
My aunt has taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her
I dont want you to come for your aunt said Daisy I want you to come for me
And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman
He declared that at any rate he would certainly come
After this Daisy stopped teasing
Winterbourne took a carriage and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk the young girl was very quiet
In the evening Winterbourne mentioned to Mrs Costello that he had spent the afternoon at Chillon with Miss Daisy Miller
The Americansof the courier
asked this lady
Ah happily said Winterbourne the courier stayed at home
She went with you all alone
All alone
Mrs Costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle
And that she exclaimed is the young person whom you wanted me to know
PART II Winterbourne who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion to Chillon went to Rome toward the end of January
His aunt had been established there for several weeks and he had received a couple of letters from her
Those people you were so devoted to last summer at Vevey have turned up here courier and all she wrote
They seem to have made several acquaintances but the courier continues to be the most intime
The young lady however is also very intimate with some thirdrate Italians with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk
Bring me that pretty novel of CherbuliezsPaule Mere and dont come later than the 23rd
In the natural course of events Winterbourne on arriving in Rome would presently have ascertained Mrs Millers address at the American bankers and have gone to pay his compliments to Miss Daisy
After what happened at Vevey I think I may certainly call upon them he said to Mrs Costello
If after what happensat Vevey and everywhereyou desire to keep up the acquaintance you are very welcome
Of course a man may know everyone
Men are welcome to the privilege
Pray what is it that happenshere for instance
Winterbourne demanded
The girl goes about alone with her foreigners
As to what happens further you must apply elsewhere for information
She has picked up half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters and she takes them about to peoples houses
When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache
And where is the mother
I havent the least idea
They are very dreadful people
Winterbourne meditated a moment
They are very ignorant very innocent only
Depend upon it they are not bad
They are hopelessly vulgar said Mrs Costello
Whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being bad is a question for the metaphysicians
They are bad enough to dislike at any rate and for this short life that is quite enough
The news that Daisy Miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked Winterbournes impulse to go straightway to see her
He had perhaps not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently when Mr Winterbourne would arrive
If however he determined to wait a little before reminding Miss Miller of his claims to her consideration he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends
One of these friends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva where she had placed her children at school
She was a very accomplished woman and she lived in the Via Gregoriana
Winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor the room was filled with southern sunshine
He had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in announcing Madame Mila
This announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little Randolph Miller who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at Winterbourne
An instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold and then after a considerable interval Mrs Miller slowly advanced
I know you
said Randolph
Im sure you know a great many things exclaimed Winterbourne taking him by the hand
How is your education coming on
Daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess but when she heard Winterbournes voice she quickly turned her head
Well I declare
she said
I told you I should come you know Winterbourne rejoined smiling
Well I didnt believe it said Miss Daisy
I am much obliged to you laughed the young man
You might have come to see me
said Daisy
I arrived only yesterday
I dont believe tte that
the young girl declared
Winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother but this lady evaded his glance and seating herself fixed her eyes upon her son
Weve got a bigger place than this said Randolph
Its all gold on the walls
Mrs Miller turned uneasily in her chair
I told you if I were to bring you you would say something
she murmured
I told YOU
Randolph exclaimed
I tell YOU sir
he added jocosely giving Winterbourne a thump on the knee
It IS bigger too
Daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess Winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother
I hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey he said
Mrs Miller now certainly looked at himat his chin
Not very well sir she answered
Shes got the dyspepsia said Randolph
Ive got it too
Fathers got it
Ive got it most
This announcement instead of embarrassing Mrs Miller seemed to relieve her
I suffer from the liver she said
I think its this climate its less bracing than Schenectady especially in the winter season
I dont know whether you know we reside at Schenectady
I was saying to Daisy that I certainly hadnt found any one like Dr Davis and I didnt believe I should
Oh at Schenectady he stands first they think everything of him
He has so much to do and yet there was nothing he wouldnt do for me
He said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia but he was bound to cure it
Im sure there was nothing he wouldnt try
He was just going to try something new when we came off
Mr Miller wanted Daisy to see Europe for herself
But I wrote to Mr Miller that it seems as if I couldnt get on without Dr Davis
At Schenectady he stands at the very top and theres a great deal of sickness there too
It affects my sleep
Winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with Dr Daviss patient during which Daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion
The young man asked Mrs Miller how she was pleased with Rome
Well I must say I am disappointed she answered
We had heard so much about it I suppose we had heard too much
But we couldnt help that
We had been led to expect something different
Ah wait a little and you will become very fond of it said Winterbourne
I hate it worse and worse every day
cried Randolph
You are like the infant Hannibal said Winterbourne
No I aint
Randolph declared at a venture
You are not much like an infant said his mother
But we have seen places she resumed that I should put a long way before Rome
And in reply to Winterbournes interrogation Theres Zurich she concluded I think Zurich is lovely and we hadnt heard half so much about it
The best place weve seen is the City of Richmond
said Randolph
He means the ship his mother explained
We crossed in that ship
Randolph had a good time on the City of Richmond
Its the best place Ive seen the child repeated
Only it was turned the wrong way
Well weve got to turn the right way some time said Mrs Miller with a little laugh
Winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in Rome and she declared that Daisy was quite carried away
Its on account of the societythe societys splendid
She goes round everywhere she has made a great number of acquaintances
Of course she goes round more than I do
I must say they have been very sociable they have taken her right in
And then she knows a great many gentlemen
Oh she thinks theres nothing like Rome
Of course its a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen
By this time Daisy had turned her attention again to Winterbourne
Ive been telling Mrs Walker how mean you were
the young girl announced
And what is the evidence you have offered
asked Winterbourne rather annoyed at Miss Millers want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at Florence simply because of a certain sentimental impatience
He remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American womenthe pretty ones and this gave a largeness to the axiom were at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness
Why you were awfully mean at Vevey said Daisy
You wouldnt do anything
You wouldnt stay there when I asked you
My dearest young lady cried Winterbourne with eloquence have I come all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches
Just hear him say that
said Daisy to her hostess giving a twist to a bow on this ladys dress
Did you ever hear anything so quaint
So quaint my dear
murmured Mrs Walker in the tone of a partisan of Winterbourne
Well I dont know said Daisy fingering Mrs Walkers ribbons
Mrs Walker I want to tell you something
Motherr interposed Randolph with his rough ends to his words I tell you youve got to go
Eugenioll raisesomething
Im not afraid of Eugenio said Daisy with a toss of her head
Look here Mrs Walker she went on you know Im coming to your party
I am delighted to hear it
Ive got a lovely dress
I am very sure of that
But I want to ask a favorpermission to bring a friend
I shall be happy to see any of your friends said Mrs Walker turning with a smile to Mrs Miller
Oh they are not my friends answered Daisys mamma smiling shyly in her own fashion
I never spoke to them
Its an intimate friend of mineMr Giovanelli said Daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face
Mrs Walker was silent a moment she gave a rapid glance at Winterbourne
I shall be glad to see Mr Giovanelli she then said
Hes an Italian Daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity
Hes a great friend of mine hes the handsomest man in the world except Mr Winterbourne
He knows plenty of Italians but he wants to know some Americans
He thinks ever so much of Americans
Hes tremendously clever
Hes perfectly lovely
It was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to Mrs Walkers party and then Mrs Miller prepared to take her leave
I guess well go back to the hotel she said
You may go back to the hotel Mother but Im going to take a walk said Daisy
Shes going to walk with Mr Giovanelli Randolph proclaimed
I am going to the Pincio said Daisy smiling
Alone my dearat this hour
Mrs Walker asked
The afternoon was drawing to a closeit was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians
I dont think its safe my dear said Mrs Walker
Neither do I subjoined Mrs Miller
Youll get the fever as sure as you live
Remember what Dr Davis told you
Give her some medicine before she goes said Randolph
The company had risen to its feet Daisy still showing her pretty teeth bent over and kissed her hostess
Mrs Walker you are too perfect she said
Im not going alone I am going to meet a friend
Your friend wont keep you from getting the fever Mrs Miller observed
Is it Mr
Giovanelli
asked the hostess
Winterbourne was watching the young girl at this question his attention quickened
She stood there smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons she glanced at Winterbourne
Then while she glanced and smiled she answered without a shade of hesitation Mr Giovanellithe beautiful Giovanelli
My dear young friend said Mrs Walker taking her hand pleadingly dont walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian
Well he speaks English said Mrs Miller
Gracious me
Daisy exclaimed I dont to do anything improper
Theres an easy way to settle it
She continued to glance at Winterbourne
The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant and if Mr Winterbourne were as polite as he pretends he would offer to walk with me
Winterbournes politeness hastened to affirm itself and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her
They passed downstairs before her mother and at the door Winterbourne perceived Mrs Millers carriage drawn up with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at Vevey seated within
Goodbye Eugenio
cried Daisy Im going to take a walk
The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is in fact rapidly traversed
As the day was splendid however and the concourse of vehicles walkers and loungers numerous the young Americans found their progress much delayed
This fact was highly agreeable to Winterbourne in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation
The slowmoving idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm and he wondered what on earth had been in Daisys mind when she proposed to expose herself unattended to its appreciation
His own mission to her sense apparently was to consign her to the hands of Mr Giovanelli but Winterbourne at once annoyed and gratified resolved that he would do no such thing
Why havent you been to see me
asked Daisy
You cant get out of that
I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train
You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped
cried the young girl with her little laugh
I suppose you were asleep
You have had time to go to see Mrs
Walker
I knew Mrs Walker Winterbourne began to explain
I know where you knew her
You knew her at Geneva
She told me so
Well you knew me at Vevey
Thats just as good
So you ought to have come
She asked him no other question than this she began to prattle about her own affairs
Weve got splendid rooms at the hotel Eugenio says theyre the best rooms in Rome
We are going to stay all winter if we dont die of the fever and I guess well stay then
Its a great deal nicer than I thought I thought it would be fearfully quiet I was sure it would be awfully poky
I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things
But we only had about a week of that and now Im enjoying myself
I know ever so many people and they are all so charming
The societys extremely select
There are all kindsEnglish and Germans and Italians
I think I like the English best
I like their style of conversation
But there are some lovely Americans
I never saw anything so hospitable
Theres something or other every day
Theres not much dancing but I must say I never thought dancing was everything
I was always fond of conversation
I guess I shall have plenty at Mrs Walkers her rooms are so small
When they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens Miss Miller began to wonder where Mr Giovanelli might be
We had better go straight to that place in front she said where you look at the view
I certainly shall not help you to find him Winterbourne declared
Then I shall find him without you cried Miss Daisy
You certainly wont leave me
cried Winterbourne
She burst into her little laugh
Are you afraid youll get lost or run over
But theres Giovanelli leaning against that tree
Hes staring at the women in the carriages did you ever see anything so cool
Winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane
He had a handsome face an artfully poised hat a glass in one eye and a nosegay in his buttonhole
Winterbourne looked at him a moment and then said Do you mean to speak to that man
Do I mean to speak to him
Why you dont suppose I mean to communicate by signs
Pray understand then said Winterbourne that I intend to remain with you
Daisy stopped and looked at him without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples
Well shes a cool one
thought the young man
I dont like the way you say that said Daisy
Its too imperious
I beg your pardon if I say it wrong
The main point is to give you an idea of my meaning
The young girl looked at him more gravely but with eyes that were prettier than ever
I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me or to interfere with anything I do
I think you have made a mistake said Winterbourne
You should sometimes listen to a gentlemanthe right one
Daisy began to laugh again
I do nothing but listen to gentlemen
she exclaimed
Tell me if Mr Giovanelli is the right one
The gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity
He bowed to Winterbourne as well as to the latters companion he had a brilliant smile an intelligent eye Winterbourne thought him not a badlooking fellow
But he nevertheless said to Daisy No hes not the right one
Daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other
She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her Mr Giovanelli who spoke English very cleverlyWinterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense he was extremely urbane and the young American who said nothing reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed
Giovanelli of course had counted upon something more intimate he had not bargained for a party of three
But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested farstretching intentions
Winterbourne flattered himself that he had taken his measure
He is not a gentleman said the young American he is only a clever imitation of one
He is a music master or a pennyaliner or a thirdrate artist
Dn his good looks
Mr Giovanelli had certainly a very pretty face but Winterbourne felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywomans not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one
Giovanelli chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable
It was true that if he was an imitation the imitation was brilliant
Nevertheless Winterbourne said to himself a nice girl ought to know
And then he came back to the question whether this was in fact a nice girl
Would a nice girl even allowing for her being a little American flirt make a rendezvous with a presumably lowlived foreigner
The rendezvous in this case indeed had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism
Singular though it may seem Winterbourne was vexed that the young girl in joining her amoroso should not appear more impatient of his own company and he was vexed because of his inclination
It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly wellconducted young lady she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy
It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers lawless passions
That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing
But Daisy on this occasion continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence
She had been walking some quarter of an hour attended by her two cavaliers and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety as it seemed to Winterbourne to the pretty speeches of Mr Giovanelli when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path
At the same moment Winterbourne perceived that his friend Mrs Walkerthe lady whose house he had lately left was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him
Leaving Miss Millers side he hastened to obey her summons
Mrs Walker was flushed she wore an excited air
It is really too dreadful she said
That girl must not do this sort of thing
She must not walk here with you two men
Fifty people have noticed her
Winterbourne raised his eyebrows
I think its a pity to make too much fuss about it
Its a pity to let the girl ruin herself
She is very innocent said Winterbourne
Shes very crazy
cried Mrs Walker
Did you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother
After you had all left me just now I could not sit still for thinking of it
It seemed too pitiful not even to attempt to save her
I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet and came here as quickly as possible
Thank Heaven I have found you
What do you propose to do with us
asked Winterbourne smiling
To ask her to get in to drive her about here for half an hour so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild and then to take her safely home
I dont think its a very happy thought said Winterbourne but you can try
Mrs Walker tried
The young man went in pursuit of Miss Miller who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion
Daisy on learning that Mrs Walker wished to speak to her retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with Mr Giovanelli at her side
She declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to Mrs Walker
She immediately achieved the introduction and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as Mrs Walkers carriage rug
I am glad you admire it said this lady smiling sweetly
Will you get in and let me put it over you
Oh no thank you said Daisy
I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it
Do get in and drive with me
said Mrs Walker
That would be charming but its so enchanting just as I am
and Daisy gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her
It may be enchanting dear child but it is not the custom here urged Mrs Walker leaning forward in her victoria with her hands devoutly clasped
Well it ought to be then
said Daisy
If I didnt walk I should expire
You should walk with your mother dear cried the lady from Geneva losing patience
With my mother dear
exclaimed the young girl
Winterbourne saw that she scented interference
My mother never walked ten steps in her life
And then you know she added with a laugh I am more than five years old
You are old enough to be more reasonable
You are old enough dear Miss Miller to be talked about
Daisy looked at Mrs Walker smiling intensely
Talked about
What do you mean
Come into my carriage and I will tell you
Daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other
Mr Giovanelli was bowing to and fro rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably Winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene
I dont think I want to know what you mean said Daisy presently
I dont think I should like it
Winterbourne wished that Mrs Walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away but this lady did not enjoy being defied as she afterward told him
Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl
she demanded
Gracious
exclaimed Daisy
She looked again at Mr Giovanelli then she turned to Winterbourne
There was a little pink flush in her cheek she was tremendously pretty
Does Mr Winterbourne think she asked slowly smiling throwing back her head and glancing at him from head to foot that to save my reputation I ought to get into the carriage
Winterbourne colored for an instant he hesitated greatly
It seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her reputation
But he himself in fact must speak in accordance with gallantry
The finest gallantry here was simply to tell her the truth and the truth for Winterbourne as the few indications I have been able to give have made him known to the reader was that Daisy Miller should take Mrs Walkers advice
He looked at her exquisite prettiness and then he said very gently I think you should get into the carriage
Daisy gave a violent laugh
I never heard anything so stiff
If this is improper Mrs Walker she pursued then I am all improper and you must give me up
Goodbye I hope youll have a lovely ride
and with Mr Giovanelli who made a triumphantly obsequious salute she turned away
Mrs Walker sat looking after her and there were tears in Mrs Walkers eyes
Get in here sir she said to Winterbourne indicating the place beside her
The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany Miss Miller whereupon Mrs Walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again
She was evidently in earnest
Winterbourne overtook Daisy and her companion and offering the young girl his hand told her that Mrs Walker had made an imperious claim upon his society
He expected that in answer she would say something rather free something to commit herself still further to that recklessness from which Mrs Walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her
But she only shook his hand hardly looking at him while Mr Giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat
Winterbourne was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in Mrs Walkers victoria
That was not clever of you he said candidly while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages
In such a case his companion answered I dont wish to be clever I wish to be EARNEST
Well your earnestness has only offended her and put her off
It has happened very well said Mrs Walker
If she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself the sooner one knows it the better one can act accordingly
I suspect she meant no harm Winterbourne rejoined
So I thought a month ago
But she has been going too far
What has she been doing
Everything that is not done here
Flirting with any man she could pick up sitting in corners with mysterious Italians dancing all the evening with the same partners receiving visits at eleven oclock at night
Her mother goes away when visitors come
But her brother said Winterbourne laughing sits up till midnight
He must be edified by what he sees
Im told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for Miss Miller
The servants be hanged
said Winterbourne angrily
The poor girls only fault he presently added is that she is very uncultivated
She is naturally indelicate Mrs Walker declared
Take that example this morning
How long had you known her at Vevey
A couple of days
Fancy then her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place
Winterbourne was silent for some moments then he said I suspect Mrs Walker that you and I have lived too long at Geneva
And he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage
I wished to beg you to cease your relations with Miss Miller not to flirt with herto give her no further opportunity to expose herselfto let her alone in short
Im afraid I cant do that said Winterbourne
I like her extremely
All the more reason that you shouldnt help her to make a scandal
There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her
There certainly will be in the way she takes them
But I have said what I had on my conscience Mrs Walker pursued
If you wish to rejoin the young lady I will put you down
Here by the way you have a chance
The carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that overhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese
It is bordered by a large parapet near which there are several seats
One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady toward whom Mrs Walker gave a toss of her head
At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet
Winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop he now descended from the carriage
His companion looked at him a moment in silence then while he raised his hat she drove majestically away
Winterbourne stood there he had turned his eyes toward Daisy and her cavalier
They evidently saw no one they were too deeply occupied with each other
When they reached the low garden wall they stood a moment looking off at the great flattopped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese then Giovanelli seated himself familiarly upon the broad ledge of the wall
The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars whereupon Daisys companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it
She came a little nearer and he held the parasol over her then still holding it he let it rest upon her shoulder so that both of their heads were hidden from Winterbourne
This young man lingered a moment then he began to walk
But he walkednot toward the couple with the parasol toward the residence of his aunt Mrs Costello
He flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he at least asked for Mrs Miller at her hotel
This lady and her daughter however were not at home and on the next day after repeating his visit Winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them
Mrs Walkers party took place on the evening of the third day and in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess Winterbourne was among the guests
Mrs Walker was one of those American ladies who while residing abroad make a point in their own phrase of studying European society and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve as it were as textbooks
When Winterbourne arrived Daisy Miller was not there but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone very shyly and ruefully
Mrs Millers hair above her exposedlooking temples was more frizzled than ever
As she approached Mrs Walker Winterbourne also drew near
You see Ive come all alone said poor Mrs Miller
Im so frightened I dont know what to do
Its the first time Ive ever been to a party alone especially in this country
I wanted to bring Randolph or Eugenio or someone but Daisy just pushed me off by myself
I aint used to going round alone
And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society
demanded Mrs Walker impressively
Well Daisys all dressed said Mrs Miller with that accent of the dispassionate if not of the philosophic historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughters career
She got dressed on purpose before dinner
But shes got a friend of hers there that gentlemanthe Italianthat she wanted to bring
Theyve got going at the piano it seems as if they couldnt leave off
Mr Giovanelli sings splendidly
But I guess theyll come before very long concluded Mrs Miller hopefully
Im sorry she should come in that way said Mrs Walker
Well I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours responded Daisys mamma
I didnt see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with Mr
Giovanelli
This is most horrible
said Mrs Walker turning away and addressing herself to Winterbourne
Elle saffiche
Its her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her
When she comes I shall not speak to her
Daisy came after eleven oclock but she was not on such an occasion a young lady to wait to be spoken to
She rustled forward in radiant loveliness smiling and chattering carrying a large bouquet and attended by Mr Giovanelli
Everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her
She came straight to Mrs Walker
Im afraid you thought I never was coming so I sent mother off to tell you
I wanted to make Mr Giovanelli practice some things before he came you know he sings beautifully and I want you to ask him to sing
This is Mr Giovanelli you know I introduced him to you hes got the most lovely voice and he knows the most charming set of songs
I made him go over them this evening on purpose we had the greatest time at the hotel
Of all this Daisy delivered herself with the sweetest brightest audibleness looking now at her hostess and now round the room while she gave a series of little pats round her shoulders to the edges of her dress
Is there anyone I know
she asked
I think every one knows you
said Mrs Walker pregnantly and she gave a very cursory greeting to Mr Giovanelli
This gentleman bore himself gallantly
He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome Italian at an evening party
He sang very prettily half a dozen songs though Mrs Walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him
It was apparently not Daisy who had given him his orders
Daisy sat at a distance from the piano and though she had publicly as it were professed a high admiration for his singing talked not inaudibly while it was going on
Its a pity these rooms are so small we cant dance she said to Winterbourne as if she had seen him five minutes before
I am not sorry we cant dance Winterbourne answered I dont dance
Of course you dont dance youre too stiff said Miss Daisy
I hope you enjoyed your drive with Mrs
Walker
No
I didnt enjoy it I preferred walking with you
We paired off that was much better said Daisy
But did you ever hear anything so cool as Mrs Walkers wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor Mr Giovanelli and under the pretext that it was proper
People have different ideas
It would have been most unkind he had been talking about that walk for ten days
He should not have talked about it at all said Winterbourne he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him
About the streets
cried Daisy with her pretty stare
Where then would he have proposed to her to walk
The Pincio is not the streets either and I thank goodness am not a young lady of this country
The young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it so far as I can learn I dont see why I should change my habits for THEM
I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt said Winterbourne gravely
Of course they are she cried giving him her little smiling stare again
Im a fearful frightful flirt
Did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not
But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice girl
Youre a very nice girl but I wish you would flirt with me and me only said Winterbourne
Ah
thank youthank you very much you are the last man I should think of flirting with
As I have had the pleasure of informing you you are too stiff
You say that too often said Winterbourne
Daisy gave a delighted laugh
If I could have the sweet hope of making you angry I should say it again
Dont do that when I am angry Im stiffer than ever
But if you wont flirt with me do cease at least to flirt with your friend at the piano they dont understand that sort of thing here
I thought they understood nothing else
exclaimed Daisy
Not in young unmarried women
It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones Daisy declared
Well said Winterbourne when you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place
Flirting is a purely American custom it doesnt exist here
So when you show yourself in public with Mr Giovanelli and without your mother Gracious
poor Mother
interposed Daisy
Though you may be flirting Mr Giovanelli is not he means something else
He isnt preaching at any rate said Daisy with vivacity
And if you want very much to know we are neither of us flirting we are too good friends for that we are very intimate friends
Ah
rejoined Winterbourne if you are in love with each other it is another affair
She had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation but she immediately got up blushing visibly and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world
Mr Giovanelli at least she said giving her interlocutor a single glance never says such very disagreeable things to me
Winterbourne was bewildered he stood staring
Mr Giovanelli had finished singing
He left the piano and came over to Daisy
Wont you come into the other room and have some tea
he asked bending before her with his ornamental smile
Daisy turned to Winterbourne beginning to smile again
He was still more perplexed for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear though it seemed to prove indeed that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses
It has never occurred to Mr Winterbourne to offer me any tea she said with her little tormenting manner
I have offered you advice Winterbourne rejoined
I prefer weak tea
cried Daisy and she went off with the brilliant Giovanelli
She sat with him in the adjoining room in the embrasure of the window for the rest of the evening
There was an interesting performance at the piano but neither of these young people gave heed to it
When Daisy came to take leave of Mrs Walker this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girls arrival
She turned her back straight upon Miss Miller and left her to depart with what grace she might
Winterbourne was standing near the door he saw it all
Daisy turned very pale and looked at her mother but Mrs Miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms
She appeared indeed to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them
Good night Mrs Walker she said weve had a beautiful evening
You see if I let Daisy come to parties without me I dont want her to go away without me
Daisy turned away looking with a pale grave face at the circle near the door Winterbourne saw that for the first moment she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation
He on his side was greatly touched
That was very cruel he said to Mrs Walker
She never enters my drawing room again
replied his hostess
Since Winterbourne was not to meet her in Mrs Walkers drawing room he went as often as possible to Mrs Millers hotel
The ladies were rarely at home but when he found them the devoted Giovanelli was always present
Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room with Daisy alone Mrs Miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance
Winterbourne noted at first with surprise that Daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect
She showed no displeasure at her teteatete with Giovanelli being interrupted she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one there was always in her conversation the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility
Winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in Giovanelli it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews and he liked her the more for her innocentlooking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor
He could hardly have said why but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous
At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readers part I may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him it very often seemed to Winterbourne among the possibilities that given certain contingencies he should be afraidliterally afraidof these ladies he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of Daisy Miller
It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to Daisy it was part of his conviction or rather of his apprehension that she would prove a very light young person
But she was evidently very much interested in Giovanelli
She looked at him whenever he spoke she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that she was constantly chaffing and abusing him
She appeared completely to have forgotten that Winterbourne had said anything to displease her at Mrs Walkers little party
One Sunday afternoon having gone to St Peters with his aunt Winterbourne perceived Daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable Giovanelli
Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to Mrs Costello
This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass and then she said Thats what makes you so pensive in these days eh
I had not the least idea I was pensive said the young man
You are very much preoccupied you are thinking of something
And what is it he asked that you accuse me of thinking of
Of that young ladysMiss Bakers Miss Chandlerswhats her name Miss Millers intrigue with that little barbers block
Do you call it an intrigue Winterbourne askedan affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity
Thats their folly said Mrs Costello its not their merit
No rejoined Winterbourne with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded
I dont believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue
I have heard a dozen people speak of it they say she is quite carried away by him
They are certainly very intimate said Winterbourne
Mrs Costello inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument
He is very handsome
One easily sees how it is
She thinks him the most elegant man in the world the finest gentleman
She has never seen anything like him he is better even than the courier
It was the courier probably who introduced him and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady the courier will come in for a magnificent commission
I dont believe she thinks of marrying him said Winterbourne and I dont believe he hopes to marry her
You may be very sure she thinks of nothing
She goes on from day to day from hour to hour as they did in the Golden Age
I can imagine nothing more vulgar
And at the same time added Mrs Costello depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is engaged
I think that is more than Giovanelli expects said Winterbourne
Who is Giovanelli
The little Italian
I have asked questions about him and learned something
He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man
I believe he is in a small way a cavaliere avvocato
But he doesnt move in what are called the first circles
I think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him
He is evidently immensely charmed with Miss Miller
If she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world he on his side has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor such opulence such expensiveness as this young ladys
And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting
I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her
That must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck
He has nothing but his handsome face to offer and there is a substantial Mr Miller in that mysterious land of dollars
Giovanelli knows that he hasnt a title to offer
If he were only a count or a marchese
He must wonder at his luck at the way they have taken him up
He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks Miss Miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies
said Mrs Costello
It is very true Winterbourne pursued that Daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage ofwhat shall I call itof culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins
I believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception
Ah
but the avvocato cant believe it said Mrs Costello
Of the observation excited by Daisys intrigue Winterbourne gathered that day at St Peters sufficient evidence
A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with Mrs Costello who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters
The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir and meanwhile between Mrs Costello and her friends there was a great deal said about poor little Miss Millers going really too far
Winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard but when coming out upon the great steps of the church he saw Daisy who had emerged before him get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed
He felt very sorry for hernot exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty and undefended and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder
He made an attempt after this to give a hint to Mrs Miller
He met one day in the Corso a friend a tourist like himself who had just come out of the Doria Palace where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery
His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace and then said And in the same cabinet by the way I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind that pretty American girl whom you pointed out to me last week
In answer to Winterbournes inquiries his friend narrated that the pretty American girlprettier than everwas seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined
Who was her companion
asked Winterbourne
A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole
The girl is delightfully pretty but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde
So she is
answered Winterbourne and having assured himself that his informant had seen Daisy and her companion but five minutes before he jumped into a cab and went to call on Mrs Miller
She was at home but she apologized to him for receiving him in Daisys absence
Shes gone out somewhere with Mr Giovanelli said Mrs Miller
Shes always going round with Mr
Giovanelli
I have noticed that they are very intimate Winterbourne observed
Oh it seems as if they couldnt live without each other
said Mrs Miller
Well hes a real gentleman anyhow
I keep telling Daisy shes engaged
And what does Daisy say
Oh she says she isnt engaged
But she might as well be
this impartial parent resumed she goes on as if she was
But Ive made Mr Giovanelli promise to tell me if SHE doesnt
I should want to write to Mr Miller about itshouldnt you
Winterbourne replied that he certainly should and the state of mind of Daisys mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard
After this Daisy was never at home and Winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances because as he perceived these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far
They ceased to invite her and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that though Miss Daisy Miller was a young American lady her behavior was not representative was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal
Winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all
He said to himself that she was too light and childish too uncultivated and unreasoning too provincial to have reflected upon her ostracism or even to have perceived it
Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant passionate perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced
He asked himself whether Daisys defiance came from the consciousness of innocence or from her being essentially a young person of the reckless class
It must be admitted that holding ones self to a belief in Daisys innocence came to seem to Winterbourne more and more a matter of finespun gallantry
As I have already had occasion to relate he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic national and how far they were personal
From either view of them he had somehow missed her and now it was too late
She was carried away by Mr Giovanelli
A few days after his brief interview with her mother he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of the Caesars
The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure
Daisy was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions
It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as just then
He stood looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city inhaling the softly humid odors and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion
It seemed to him also that Daisy had never looked so pretty but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her
Giovanelli was at her side and Giovanelli too wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy
Well said Daisy I should think you would be lonesome
Lonesome
asked Winterbourne
You are always going round by yourself
Cant you get anyone to walk with you
I am not so fortunate said Winterbourne as your companion
Giovanelli from the first had treated Winterbourne with distinguished politeness
He listened with a deferential air to his remarks he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that Winterbourne was a superior young man
He carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer he had obviously a great deal of tact he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him
It even seemed to Winterbourne at times that Giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with himto say to him as an intelligent man that bless you HE knew how extraordinary was this young lady and didnt flatter himself with delusive or at least TOO delusivehopes of matrimony and dollars
On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole
I know why you say that said Daisy watching Giovanelli
Because you think I go round too much with HIM
And she nodded at her attendant
Every one thinks soif you care to know said Winterbourne
Of course I care to know
Daisy exclaimed seriously
But I dont believe it
They are only pretending to be shocked
They dont really care a straw what I do
Besides I dont go round so much
I think you will find they do care
They will show it disagreeably
Daisy looked at him a moment
How disagreeably
Havent you noticed anything
Winterbourne asked
I have noticed you
But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time I saw you
You will find I am not so stiff as several others said Winterbourne smiling
How shall I find it
By going to see the others
What will they do to me
They will give you the cold shoulder
Do you know what that means
Daisy was looking at him intently she began to color
Do you mean as Mrs Walker did the other night
Exactly
said Winterbourne
She looked away at Giovanelli who was decorating himself with his almond blossom
Then looking back at Winterbourne I shouldnt think you would let people be so unkind
she said
How can I help it
he asked
I should think you would say something
I do say something and he paused a moment
I say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged
Well she does said Daisy very simply
Winterbourne began to laugh
And does Randolph believe it
he asked
I guess Randolph doesnt believe anything said Daisy
Randolphs skepticism excited Winterbourne to further hilarity and he observed that Giovanelli was coming back to them
Daisy observing it too addressed herself again to her countryman
Since you have mentioned it she said I AM engaged
   Winterbourne looked at her he had stopped laughing
You dont believe
she added
He was silent a moment and then Yes I believe it he said
Oh no you dont
she answered
Well thenI am not
The young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure so that Winterbourne who had but lately entered presently took leave of them
A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the Caelian Hill and on arriving dismissed his hired vehicle
The evening was charming and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum
There was a waning moon in the sky and her radiance was not brilliant but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it
When on his return from the villa it was eleven oclock Winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum it recurred to him as a lover of the picturesque that the interior in the pale moonshine would be well worth a glance
He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches near which as he observed an open carriageone of the little Roman streetcabswas stationed
Then he passed in among the cavernous shadows of the great structure and emerged upon the clear and silent arena
The place had never seemed to him more impressive
Onehalf of the gigantic circus was in deep shade the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk
As he stood there he began to murmur Byrons famous lines out of Manfred but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets they are deprecated by the doctors
The historic atmosphere was there certainly but the historic atmosphere scientifically considered was no better than a villainous miasma
Winterbourne walked to the middle of the arena to take a more general glance intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat
The great cross in the center was covered with shadow it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly
Then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base
One of these was a woman seated her companion was standing in front of her
Presently the sound of the womans voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air
Well he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the Christian martyrs
These were the words he heard in the familiar accent of Miss Daisy Miller
Let us hope he is not very hungry responded the ingenious Giovanelli
He will have to take me first you will serve for dessert
Winterbourne stopped with a sort of horror and it must be added with a sort of relief
It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisys behavior and the riddle had become easy to read
She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect
He stood there looking at her looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely he himself must have been more brightly visible
He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller
Then as he was going to advance again he checked himself not from the fear that he was doing her injustice but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism
He turned away toward the entrance of the place but as he did so he heard Daisy speak again
Why it was Mr Winterbourne
He saw me and he cuts me
What a clever little reprobate she was and how smartly she played at injured innocence
But he wouldnt cut her
Winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross
Daisy had got up Giovanelli lifted his hat
Winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness from a sanitary point of view of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria
What if she WERE a clever little reprobate
that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa
How long have you been here
he asked almost brutally
Daisy lovely in the flattering moonlight looked at him a moment
ThenAll the evening she answered gently
   I never saw anything so pretty
I am afraid said Winterbourne that you will not think Roman fever very pretty
This is the way people catch it
I wonder he added turning to Giovanelli that you a native Roman should countenance such a terrible indiscretion
Ah said the handsome native for myself I am not afraid
Neither am Ifor you
I am speaking for this young lady
Giovanelli lifted his wellshaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth
But he took Winterbournes rebuke with docility
I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion but when was the signorina ever prudent
I never was sick and I dont mean to be
the signorina declared
I dont look like much but Im healthy
I was bound to see the Colosseum by moonlight I shouldnt have wanted to go home without that and we have had the most beautiful time havent we Mr Giovanelli
If there has been any danger Eugenio can give me some pills
He has got some splendid pills
I should advise you said Winterbourne to drive home as fast as possible and take one
What you say is very wise Giovanelli rejoined
I will go and make sure the carriage is at hand
And he went forward rapidly
Daisy followed with Winterbourne
He kept looking at her she seemed not in the least embarrassed
Winterbourne said nothing Daisy chattered about the beauty of the place
Well I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight
she exclaimed
Thats one good thing
Then noticing Winterbournes silence she asked him why he didnt speak
He made no answer he only began to laugh
They passed under one of the dark archways Giovanelli was in front with the carriage
Here Daisy stopped a moment looking at the young American
DID you believe I was engaged the other day
she asked
It doesnt matter what I believed the other day said Winterbourne still laughing
Well what do you believe now
I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not
He felt the young girls pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway she was apparently going to answer
But Giovanelli hurried her forward
Quick
quick
he said if we get in by midnight we are quite safe
Daisy took her seat in the carriage and the fortunate Italian placed himself beside her
Dont forget Eugenios pills
said Winterbourne as he lifted his hat
I dont care said Daisy in a little strange tone whether I have Roman fever or not
Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement
Winterbourne to do him justice as it were mentioned to no one that he had encountered Miss Miller at midnight in the Colosseum with a gentleman but nevertheless a couple of days later the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little American circle and commented accordingly
Winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel and that after Daisys return there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver
But the young man was conscious at the same moment that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little American flirt should be talked about by lowminded menials
These people a day or two later had serious information to give the little American flirt was alarmingly ill Winterbourne when the rumor came to him immediately went to the hotel for more news
He found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him and that they were being entertained in Mrs Millers salon by Randolph
Its going round at night said Randolphthats what made her sick
Shes always going round at night
I shouldnt think shed want to its so plaguy dark
You cant see anything here at night except when theres a moon
In America theres always a moon
Mrs Miller was invisible she was now at least giving her aughter the advantage of her society
It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her and once he saw Mrs Miller who though deeply alarmed was rather to his surprise perfectly composed and as it appeared a most efficient and judicious nurse
She talked a good deal about Dr Davis but Winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not after all such a monstrous goose
Daisy spoke of you the other day she said to him
Half the time she doesnt know what shes saying but that time I think she did
She gave me a message she told me to tell you
She told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian
I am sure I am very glad Mr Giovanelli hasnt been near us since she was taken ill
I thought he was so much of a gentleman but I dont call that very polite
A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking Daisy round at night
Well so I am but I suppose he knows Im a lady
I would scorn to scold him
Anyway she says shes not engaged
I dont know why she wanted you to know but she said to me three times Mind you tell Mr
Winterbourne
And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland
But I said I wouldnt give any such messages as that
Only if she is not engaged Im sure Im glad to know it
But as Winterbourne had said it mattered very little
A week after this the poor girl died it had been a terrible case of the fever
Daisys grave was in the little Protestant cemetery in an angle of the wall of imperial Rome beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers
Winterbourne stood there beside it with a number of other mourners a number larger than the scandal excited by the young ladys career would have led you to expect
Near him stood Giovanelli who came nearer still before Winterbourne turned away
Giovanelli was very pale on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole he seemed to wish to say something
At last he said She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw and the most amiable and then he added in a moment and she was the most innocent
Winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words And the most innocent
The most innocent
Winterbourne felt sore and angry
Why the devil he asked did you take her to that fatal place
Mr Giovanellis urbanity was apparently imperturbable
He looked on the ground a moment and then he said For myself I had no fear and she wanted to go
That was no reason
Winterbourne declared
The subtle Roman again dropped his eyes
If she had lived I should have got nothing
She would never have married me I am sure
She would never have married you
For a moment I hoped so
But no
I am sure
Winterbourne listened to him he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies
When he turned away again Mr Giovanelli with his light slow step had retired
Winterbourne almost immediately left Rome but the following summer he again met his aunt Mrs Costello at Vevey
Mrs Costello was fond of Vevey
In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller and her mystifying manners
One day he spoke of her to his auntsaid it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice
I am sure I dont know said Mrs Costello
How did your injustice affect her
She sent me a message before her death which I didnt understand at the time but I have understood it since
She would have appreciated ones esteem
Is that a modest way asked Mrs Costello of saying that she would have reciprocated ones affection
Winterbourne offered no answer to this question but he presently said You were right in that remark that you made last summer
I was booked to make a mistake
I have lived too long in foreign parts
Nevertheless he went back to live at Geneva whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn a report that he is studying hardan intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady
