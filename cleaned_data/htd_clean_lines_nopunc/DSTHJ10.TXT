THE DUST SETTLES I THE DUST IS STIRRED DUST was piled in thick velvety folds on the weeds and grass of the open Kansas prairie it lay a thin veil on the scrawny black horses and the sharpboned cow picketed near a covered wagon it showered to the ground in little clouds as Mrs Wade a tall spare woman moved about a campfire preparing supper in a sizzling skillet huge iron kettle and blackened coffeepot
Her husband pale and gaunt the shadow of death in his weary face and the droop of his body sat leaning against one of the wagon wheels trying to quiet a wailing emaciated yearold baby while little towheaded Nellie a vigorous child of seven frolicked undaunted by the August heat
Does beat all how she kin do it thought Wade listlessly
Ma she shouted suddenly in her shrill strident treble I see Martin comin
The mother made no answer until the strapping fourteenyearold boy tall and powerful for his age had deposited his bucket of water at her side
As he drew the back of a tanned muscular hand across his dripping forehead she asked shortly What kept you so long
The creeks near dry
I had to follow it half a mile to find anything fit to drink
This aint no time of year to start farmin he added glum and sullen
I spose you know moren your father and mother suggested Wade
I know wholl have to do all the work the boy retorted bitterness and rebellion in his tone
Oh quit your arguin commanded the mother
We got enough to do to move nearer that water tonight without wastin time talkin
Suppers ready
Martin and Nellie sat down beside the redandwhitecheckered cloth spread on the ground and Wade after passing the still fretting baby to his wife took his place with them
Seems like he gets thinner every day he commented anxiously
With a swift gesture of fierce tenderness Mrs Wade gathered little Benny to her
Oh God
she gasped
I know Im goin to lose him
That cows milk dont set right on his stomach
It wont set any better after old Brindle fills up on this dust observed Martin belligerency in his brassy voice
Thatll do came sharply from his father
I dont think this is paradise no moren you do but we wouldnt be the first whove come with nothing but a team and made a living
You mark what I tell you Martin land aint always goin to be had so cheap and I wont be living this time another year
Before I die Im goin to see your mother and you children settled
Some day when youve got a fine farm here youll see the sense of what Im doin now and thank me for it
The boys cold blue eyes became the color of ice as he retorted If I ever make a farm out o this dust Ill sure ave earned it
I guess your motherll be doin her share of that all right
And dont you forget it
As he intoned in even accents Wades eyes so deep in their somber sockets dwelt with a strange wistful compassion on his faded wife
The rays of the setting sun brought out the drabness of her
Already at thirtyfive grey streaked the scanty dull hair wrinkles lined the worn olivebrown face and the tendons of the thin neck stood out
Chaotically he compared her to the happy young girlround of cheek and laughing of eyehe had married back in Ohio fifteen years before
It comforted him a little to remember he hadnt done so badly by her until the war had torn him from his rented farm and she had been forced to do a mans work in field and barn
Exposure and a lung wound from a rebel bullet had sent Wade home an invalid and during the five years which had followed he had realized only too well how little help he had been to her
It is not likely he would have had the iron persistency of purpose to drag her through this new stern trial if he had not known that in her heart as in his there gnawed ever an alldevouring hunger to work land of their own a fervent aspiration to establish a solid basis of selfsustentation upon which their children might build
From the day a letter had come from Peter Mall an excomrade in Wades old regiment saying the quartersection next his own could be bought by paying annually a dollar and twentyfive cents an acre for seven years their hopes had risen into determination that had become unshakable
Before the eyes of Jacob and Sarah Wade there had hovered like a promise the picture of the snug farm that could be evolved from this virgin soil
Strengthened by this vision and stimulated by the fact of Wades increasing weakness they had sold their few possessions except the simplest necessities for camping had made a canvas cover for their wagon stocked up with smoked meat corn meal and coffee tied old Brindle behind fastened a coop of chickens against the wagonbox and without faltering had made the long pilgrimage
Their indomitable courage and faith Martins physical strength and the pulling power of their two ringboned horses this was their capital
It seemed pitifully meager to Wade at that despondent moment exhausted as he was by the long hard journey and the sultry heat
Never had he been so taunted by a sense of failure so torn by the haunting knowledge that he must soon leave his family
To diethat was nothing but the fears of what his death might mean to this group gripped his heart and shook his soul
If only Martin were more tender
There was something so ruthless in the boy so overbearing and heartless
Not that he was ever deliberately cruel but there was an insensibility to the feelings of others a capacity placidly to ignore them that made Wade tremble for the future
Martin would work and work hard he was no shirk but would he ever feel any responsibility toward his younger brother and sister
Would he be loyal to his mother
Wade wondered if his wife ever felt as he didalmost afraid of this son of theirs
He had a way of making his father seem foolishly inexperienced and ineffectual
I reckon Wade analysed laboriously its because Im gettin less able all the time and hes growing so fasthim limber an quick and me all thumbs
There aint nothing like just plain muscle and size to make a fellow feel as if he knowd it all
Martin had never seemed more competent than this evening as supper over he harnessed the horses and helped his mother set the little caravan in motion
It was Martin who guided them to the creek Martin who decided just where to locate their camp Martin who early the next morning unloaded the wagon and made a temporary tent from its cover and Martin who set forth on a saddleless horse in search of Peter Mall
When he returned the big kindly man came with him and in Martins arms there squealed and wriggled a shoat
A smart boy youve got Jacob chuckled Peter jovially after the first heartwarming greetings
See that critter
Blame me if Martin here didnt speak right up and ask me to lend er to you
And he collapsed into gargantuan laughter
I promised when shed growed up and brought pigs wed give him back two for one Martin hastily explained
Thats what he said nodded Peter carefully switching his navy plug to the opposite cheek before settling down to reply and sez I Why Martin what dye want o that there shoat
You aint got nothin to keep her on
If I can borrow the pig sez he I reckon I can borrow the feed somewheres
God knows hell find that aint so plentiful but hes got the right idea
A new countrys a poor mans country and fellows like us have to stand together
Its borrow and lend out here
I know where you can get some seed wheat if you want to try puttin it in this fall
Theres a man by the name of Perrylives just across the Missouri linewho has thrashed fifteen hundred bushel and hell lend you three hundred or so
Hes willing to take a chance but if you get a crop he wants you should give him back an extra three hundred
It was a hard bargain but one that Wade could afford to take up for if the wheat were to freeze out or if the grasshoppers should eat it or the chinch bugs ruin it or a hail storm beat it down into the mud or if any of the many hatreds Stepmother Nature holds out toward those trusting souls who would squeeze a living from her hard handsif any of these misfortunes should transpire he would be out nothing but labor and that was the one thing he and Martin could afford to risk
The seed deal was arranged and Martin made the trip six times back and forth for the wagon could hold only fifty bushels
Perry lived twenty miles from the Wades and a whole day was consumed with each load
It was evening when Martin hungry and tired reached home with the last one and as he stopped beside the tent he noticed with surprise that there was no sign of cooking
Nellie was huddled against her mother who sat idle with little Benny in her arms
The tragic yearning her whole body expressed as she held the baby close arrested the boys attention filled him with clamoring uneasiness
His father came to help him unhitch
Whats the matter with Benny
Wade looked at Martin queerly
Hes dead
Died this mornin and your mas been holding him just like that
I want you should ride over to Peters and see if you can fetch his woman
No
came from Mrs Wade brokenly I dont want no one
Just let me alone
The shattering anguish in his mothers voice startled Martin stirred within him tumultuous veiled sensations
He was unaccustomed to seeing her show suffering and it embarrassed him
Restless and uncomfortable he was glad when his father called him to help decide where to dig the grave and fell the timber from which to make a rough box
From time to time through the long night he could not avoid observing his mother
In the white moonlight she and Benny looked as if they had been carved from stone
Dawn was breaking over them when Wade surrendering to a surge of pity put his arms around her with awkward gentleness
Ma we got to bury im
A low halfsuppressed sob broke from Mrs Wades tight lips as she clasped the tiny figure and pressed her cheek against the little head
I cant give him up she moaned I cant
It wasnt so hard with the others
Their sickness was the hand of God but Benny just aint had enough to eat
Seems like itll kill me
With deepened discomfort Martin hurried to the creek to water the horses
It was good he felt to have chores to do
This knowledge shot through him with the same thrill of discovery that a man enjoys when he first finds what an escape from the solidity of fact lies in liquor
If one worked hard and fast one could forget
That was what work did
It made one forgetthat moan that note of agony in his mothers voice that hurt look in her eyes that bronze group in the moonlight
By the time he had finished his chores his mother was getting breakfast as usual
With unspeakable relief Martin noticed that though pain haunted her face she was not crying
I heard while I was over in Missouri yesterday he ventured of a oneroom house down in the Indian Territory
The fellow who built its give up and gone back East
Maybe we could fix a sledge and haul it up here
I aint got the strength to help said Wade
Martins eyes involuntarily sought his mothers
He knew the power in her lean muscular arms the strength in her narrow shoulders
Wed better fetch it she agreed
The pair made the trip down on horseback and brought back the shack that was to be home for many years
Eighteen miles off a man had some extra handcut shingles which he was willing to trade for a horsecollar
While Mrs Wade took the long drive Martin under his fathers guidance chopped down enough trees to build a little leanto kitchen and makeshift stable
Sixteen miles south another neighbor had some potatoes to exchange for a hatching of chickens
Martin rode over with the hen and her downy brood
The long rides consuming hours were trying for Martin was needed every moment on a farm where everything was still to be done
Day by day Wade was growing weaker and it was Mrs Wade who helped put in the crop borrowing a plow harrow and extra team and repaying the loan with the use of their own horses and wagon
Luck was with their wheat which soon waved green
It seemed one of lifes harsh jests that now when the tired illnourished baby had fretted his last old Brindle waxing fat and sleek on the wheat pasture should give more rich cream than the Wades could use
He could have lived on the skimmed milk we feed to the pigs thought Martin
In the Spring he went with his father into Fallon the nearest trading point to see David Robinson the owner of the local bank
By giving a chattel mortgage on their growing wheat they borrowed enough at twenty per cent to buy seed corn and a plow
It was Wades last effort
Before the corn was in tassel he had been laid beside Benny
Martin who already had been doing a mans work now assumed a mans responsibilities
Mrs Wade consulted more and more with him relied more and more upon his judgment
She was immensely proud of him of his steadiness and dependability but at rare moments remembering her own normal childhood she would think with compunction It aint right
Young uns ought to have some fun
Seems like its makin him too old for his age
She never spoke of these feelings however
There were no expressions of tenderness in the Wade household
She was doing her best by her children and they knew it
Even Nellie child that she was understood the grimness of the battle before them
They were able to thresh enough wheat to repay their debt of six hundred bushels and keep an additional three hundred of seed for the following year
The remaining seven hundred and fifty they sold at twentyfive cents a bushel by hauling them to Fort Scottthirty miles distant
Each trip meant ten dollars but to the Wades to whom this one hundred and eightyseven dollarsthe first actual money they had seen in over a yearwas a fortune these journeys were rides of triumph fugitive flashes of glory in the long gray struggle
That Fall they paid the first installment of two hundred dollars on their land and Martin persuaded his mother to give and Robinson to take a chattel on their two horses old Brindle her calf and the pigs that other muchneeded implements might be bought
Mrs Wade toiled early and late doing part of the chores and double her share of the Spring plowing that Martin as well as Nellie could attend school in Fallon
I dont care about goin he had protested squirmingly
But on this matter his mother was without compromise
Dont say that she had commanded her voice shaken and her eyes bright with the intensity of her emotion youre goin to get an education
And Martin surprised and embarrassed by his mothers unusual exhibition of feeling had answered roughly Aw well all right then
Dont take on
I didnt say I wouldnt did I
He was twentythree and Nellie sixteen when worn out and broken down before her time her resistance completely undermined Mrs Wade died suddenly of pneumonia
Within the year Nellie married Bert Mall Peters eldest son and Martin at once bought out her half interest in the farm stock and implements giving a first mortgage to Robinson in order to pay cash
Im making it thirty dollars an acre he explained
Thats fair conceded the banker though the time will come when it will be cheap at a hundred and a half
Theres coal under all this county millions of dollars worth waiting to be mined
Maybe assented Martin laconically
As he sat in the dingy little backroom of the bank while Robinsons pen scratched busily drawing up the papers he was conscious of an odd thrill
The landit was all his own
But with this thrill welled a wave of resentment over what he considered a preposterous imposition
Who had made the land into a farm
What had Nellie ever put into it that it should be half hers
His mothernow that was different
She and he had toiled side by side like real partners her efforts had been real and unstinted
If he were buying her out for instance but Nellie
Well that was the way he noticed with many womendoing little and demanding much
He didnt care for them not he
From the day Nellie left Martin managed alone in the shack baching it and putting his whole heart and soul into the development of his quartersection
II OUT OF THE DUST AT thirtyfour Martin was still unmarried and though he had not travelled far on that strange road to affluence which for some seems a macadamized boulevard but for so many like himself a rough cowpath he had done better than the average farmer of Fallon County
To be sure this was nothing over which to gloat
A man who received forty cents a bushel for wheat was satisfied corn sold at twentyeight cents and the hogs it fattened in proportion
But his hundred and sixty acres were clear from debt four thousand dollars were on deposit drawing three per cent in The First State Bankthe old Bank of Fallon now incorporated with Robinson as its president
In the pasture fourteen sows with their seventyfive spring pigs rooted beside the sleek herd of steers fattening for market the granary bulged with corn two hundred bushels of seed wheat were ready for sowing his machinery was in excellent condition his four Percheron mares brought him each a fine mule colt once a year and the well never went dry even in August
Martin wasif one discounted the harshness of the life the dirt the endless duties and the everpressing choresa Kansas plutocrat
One fiery July day David Robinson drew up before Martins shack
The little old boxhouse was still unpainted without and unpapered within
Two chairs a homemade table with a Kansas City Star as a cloth a sheetless bed a rough cupboard a stove and floors carpeted with accumulations of untidiness completed the furnishings
Christopher Columbus
exploded Robinson why dont you fix yourself up a bit Martin
The Lord knows youre going to be able to afford it
What you need is a wifesomeone to look after you
And as Martin observing him calmly made no response he added I suppose you know what I want
Youve been watching for this day eh Martin
All Fallon Countys sitting on its hauncheswaiting
Oh I havent been worrying
A fellow situated like me with a hundred and sixty right in the way of a coal company can afford to be independent
You understand our procedure Martin Robinson continued
We are frank and aboveboard
We set the price and if you cant see your way clear to take it there are no hard feelings
We simply call it offfor good
Wade knew how true this was
When the mining first began several rebels toward the East had tried profitlessly to buck this irrefragable game and had found they had battered their unyielding heads against an equally unyielding stone wall
These men had demanded more and Robinsons company true to its threat had urbanely gone around their farms travelled on and left them behind their coal untouched and certain to so remain
Such inelastic lessons given time to soak in were sobering
Now said Robinson in his amiable matteroffact manner as I happen to know the history of this quarter backwards and forwards we can do up this deal in short order
You sign this contract which is exactly like all the others we use and Ill hand over your check
We get the bottom you keep the top I give you the sixteen thousand and the thing is done
Well Martin he added genially as Wade signed his name its a long day since you came in with your father to make that first loan to buy seed corn
Wouldnt he have opened his eyes if any one had prophesied this
Its a pity your mother couldnt have lived to enjoy your good fortune
A fine plucky woman your mother
They dont make many like her
Long after Robinsons buggy was out of sight Martin stood in his doorway and stared at the five handsome figures spelled out the even more convincing words and admired the excellent reproduction of The First State Bank
This is a whole lot of money his thoughts ran
Im rich
All this land still minepractically as much mine as everall this stock and twenty thousand dollars in moneyin cash
Its a fact
I Martin Wade am rich
He remembered how he had exulted how jubilant even intoxicated he had felt when he had received the ten dollars for the first load of wheat he had hauled to Fort Scott
Now with a check for sixteen thousandSIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARSin his hand he stood dumbly curiously unmoved
Slowly the first bitter months on this land little Bennys death from lack of nourishment his fathers desperate efforts to establish his family the years of his mothers slow crucifixion his own long struggle all floated before him in a fog of reverie
Years of deprivation of bending toil and then suddenly this had comethis miracle symbolized by this piece of paper
Martin moistened his lips
Mentally he realized all the dramatic significance of what had happened but it gave him none of the elation he had expected
This bewildered and angered him
Sixteen thousand dollars and with it no thrill
What was lacking
As he pondered puzzled and disappointed it came to him that he needed something by which to measure his wealth someone whose appreciation of it would make it real to him give him a genuine sense of its possession
What if he were to take Robinsons advice fix up a bit andmarry
Nellie had often urged the advantages of this but he had never had much to do with women they did not belong in his world and he had not missed them he had never before felt a need of marriage
Upon the few occasions when driven by his sisters persistence he had vaguely considered it he had shrunk away quickly from the thought of the unavoidable changes which would be ushered in by such a step
This shack itselfno one whom he would want would in this day consent to live in it and if he should marry his wife must be a superior woman good looking and with the push and energy of his mother
He thought of all she had meant to his father and there was Nellie not to be spoken of in the same breath yet making Bert Mall a good wife
What a cook she was
Memories of her hot fluffy biscuits baked chicken apple pies and delicious coffee carried trailing aromas that set his nostrils twitching
It would be pleasant to have satisfying meals once more to be relieved too of the bother of the three hundred chickens to have some one about in the evenings
True there would be expense oh such expensethe courting the presents the wedding the building the furniture and later innumerable new kinds of bills
But werent all the men around him married
Surely if they not nearly as well off as himself could afford it so could he
Besides wasnt it all different now that he held this check in his hand
These sixteen thousand dollars were not the same dollars which he had extorted from closefisted Nature
Each of those had come so lamely was such a symbol of sweat and aching muscles that to spend one was like parting with a portion of himself but this new almost incredible fortune had come without a turn of his hand without an hours labor
To Martin the distinction was sharp and actual
He figured quickly
Five thousand dollars would do wonders
With that amount he would build so substantially that his neighbors could no longer feel the disapprobation in which according to Nellie he was beginning to be held because of his sordid hermitlike life
That five thousand could buy many cows and additional acreagebut just now a home and a wife would be better investments
Yes he would marry and a house should be his bait
That was settled
He would drive into Fallon at once to see the carpenter and deposit the check
He was already out of the house when a thought struck him
Suppose he were to meet just the woman he might want
These soiled onceblue overalls these heavy manurespotted shoes this greasy shapeless straw hat with its dozen matches showing their red heads over the band the good soils and fertilizers of Kansas resting placidly in his ears and the lines of his necksuch a Romeo might not tempt his Juliet he must spruce up
On an aged soapbox behind the house several inches of grey water in a battered tinpan indicated a previous effort
He tossed the greasy liquid to the ground and from the well near the large homebuilt barn refilled the makeshift basin
Martins ablutions were always a strenuous affair
In his cupped hands he brought the water toward his face and at the moment he was about to apply it made pointless attempts to blow it away
This blowing and sputtering indicated the especial importance of an occasionthe more important the more vigorously he blew
Today the cold water gave a healthy glow to his face which after much stropping of his razor he shaved of a weeks growth of beard tawny as his thick crisp hair where the sun had not yet bleached it
This he soaked thoroughly in lieu of brushing before using a crippled piece of comb
The dividing line between washed and unwashed was one inch above his neckband and two above his wrists
Even when fresh from a scrubbing his hands were not entirely clean
They had been so long in contact with the earth that it had become absorbed into the very pores of his skin but they were powerful hands interesting with long palms and spatulate fingers
The black strips at the end of each nail Martin pared off with his jackknife
He entered the house a trifle nervously positive that his only clean shirt at present spread over his precious shotgun had been worn once more than he could have wished but after all how much of ones shirt showed
It would pass
The coatshirt not yet introduced a man had to slip the oldfashioned kind over his head drag it down past his shoulders and poke blindly for the sleeve openings
Martin was thankful when he felt the collar buttons in their holes
His salt and pepper suit was of a stiff unyielding material and the first time he had worn it the creases had vanished never to return
Before putting on his celluloid collar he spat on it and smeared it off with the tail of his shirt
A recalcitrant metal shaper insisted on peeking from under his lapels and his readymade tie with its two grey satincovered cardboard wings pushed out of sight seesawed necessitating frequent adjustments
His brown derby the rim of which made almost three quarters of a circle at each side seemed to want to get as far as possible from his ears and at the same time remain perched on his head
The yellow shoes looked as though each had half a billiard ball in the toe and the entire tops were perforated with many diverging lines in an attempt for the decorative
Those were the days of sore feet and corns
Hart Schaffner and Marx had not yet become rural Americas tailor
Sartorial magicians in Chicago had not yet won over the young men of the great corn belt with their snappy lines and style for the millions
In 1890 when a suit served merely as contrast to a pair of overalls the Martin Wades who would clothe themselves pulled their garments from the piles on long tables
It was for the next generation to patronize clothiers who kept each suit on its separate hanger
A movingpicture of the tall broadshouldered fellow as with creaking steps he walked from the house might bring a laugh from the young farmers of this more fastidious day but Martin was dressed no worse than any of his neighbors and far better than many
Health vigor sturdiness selfreliance shone from him and once his makeup had ceased to obtrude its clumsiness he struck one as handsome
His was a commanding physique hard as the grim plains from which he wrested his living
As Martin drove into Fallon his attention was directed toward the architecture and the women
He observed that the average homes were merely a little larger than his ownfour six or eight rooms instead of one made a little trimmer with neat porches and surrounded by wellcut lawns instead of weeds
He with his new budget could do better
Even Robinsons wellconstructed residence had probably cost only three thousand more than he himself planned to spend
Its suggestion of originality had been all but submerged by carpenters spoiled through constant work on commonplace buildings
But to Martin it was a marvellous mansion
He told himself that with such a place moved out to his quartersection he could have stood on his doorstep and chosen whomever he wished for a wife
It was an elemental materialism difficult to understand but it was a language very clear to Martin
Marriage with the men and women of his world was a practical business arranged and conducted by practical people who lived practical lives and died practical deaths
The women who might pass his way could deny their lust for concrete possessions but their actions however concealed their motives would give the lie to any ineffectual glamour of romance they might attempt to fling over their carefully measured adventures of the heart
Martin smiled cynically as he let his thoughts drift along this channel
What a lot of bosh is talked about lovers his comment ran
As if everyone didnt really know how much like drunken men they aresaying things which in a month theyll have forgotten
Folks pretend to approve of em and all the while theyre laughing at em up their sleeves
But how they respect a man whos got the root theyre all grubbing for
It may be the root of all evil but its a fact that everything people want grows from it
They hate a man for having it but theyd like to be him
Their hearts have all got strings dangling from em especially the womens
A house tied onto the other end ought to be hefty enough to fetch the best of the lot
Who could she be anyway
Was she someone in Fallon
He drove slowly thinking over the families in the different housesfour to each side of the block
The street even yet was little more than a country road
There was no indication of the six miles of pavement which later were to be Fallons pride
It had rained earlier in the week and Martin was obliged to be careful of the chuckholes in the sticky heavy gumbo soon to be the bane of pioneers venturing forth in what were to be known for a few short years as horseless carriages
Bumping along he recalled to his mind the various girls with whom he had gone to school
As if the sight of the building itself would sharpen his memory he turned north and drove past it
Like its south east and west counterparts it was a solid twostory brick affair
In time it would be demolished to make way for what would be known as the Emerson School in which to be worthy of this high title the huge stoves would be supplanted with hotwater pipes oil lamps with soft indirect lighting and unsightly outbuildings with modern plumbing
The South building would become the Whittier School the East the Longfellow and the West not to be neglected by cultures invasion the Oliver Wendell Holmes
But these changes were still to be effected
Many a school board meeting was first to be split into stormy factions of conservatives fighting to hold the old and of anarchists threatening civilization with their clamors for experimentation
Many a bond election was yet to rip the town in two with the retired farmers whose children were grown and through school satisfied with things as they were and parents of the new generation demanding gymnasiums tennis courts victrolas domestic science laboratories a public health nurse and individual lockers
Yes and the faddists were to win despite the other sides incontrovertible evidence that Fallon was headed for bankruptcy and that the proposed bonds and outstanding ones could never be met
Martin drove meditatively around the schoolhouse and was still engrossed in the problem of Who
when he reached the Square
The neat canvas drops of later years had not yet replaced the wooden awnings which gave to the town such a decidedly western appearance and which threw the sidewalks and sheltered windows into deep pools of shadow
The old brick storebuilding which housed The First State Bank was like a cool cavern
He brought out the check quietly but with a full consciousness that with one gesture he was shoving enough over that scratched and worn walnut counter to buy out half the bank
James Osborne the youthful cashier feigned complete paralysis
Why dont you give a poor fellow some warning
he beamed goodnaturedly or maybe you think youve strayed into Wall Street
This is Fallon
Fallon Kansas
So youve had your merry little session with Robinson
Put it here
and he extended a cordial hand
Oh considering the wait it isnt so wonderful
Sixteen thousand is an awful lot when its coming but it just seems about half as big when it gets here
Martin was talking not so much for Osbornes benefit as to impress a woman who had entered behind him and was awaiting her turn
He wondered why in his mental quest he had not thought of her
Here was the very person for whom he was looking
Rose Conroy the editor of the better local weekly a year or so younger than himself pleasant capable
Here was a real woman one above the average in character and brains
With a quick glance he took in her wellbuilt figure
Everything about Roseevery line every tone of her coloring suggested warmth generosity bigness
She was as much above medium height for a woman as Martin for a man
About her temples the line of her bright goldenbrown hair had an oddly pleasing irregularity
The rosy color in her cheeks brought out the rich creamy whiteness of her skin
Warm grayblue eyes were set far apart beneath a kind broad forehead and her wide generous mouth seemed made to smile
The impression of good temper and fun was accented by her nose ever so slightly uptilted
Some might have thought Rose too large her hips too rounded the soft deep bosom too full but Martins eyes were approving
Even her hands plump with broad palms square fingers and wellkept nails suggested decision
He felt the quiet distinction of her simple white dress
She was like a fullblown luxuriant white and gold flowerlike a rose a fullblown white rose Martin realized suddenly
One couldnt call her pretty but there was something about her that gave the impression of sumptuous good looks
He liked too the spirited carriage of her head
Healthy goodsense sound all through was his final appraisement
Pocketing his bankbook he gave her a sharp nod a colorless howdedo Miss Rose and a tip of the hat that might have been a little less stiff had he been more accustomed to greeting the ladies
Right well thank you Martin was her cordial response and her friendly smile told him she had heard and understood the remarks about the big deal
He was curious to know how it had impressed her
Hurrying out he asked himself how he could begin advances
Either he must do something quickly in time to get home for the evening chores or he must wait until another day
He must think out a plan at once
Passing the bakery half way down the block he dropped in ordered a chocolate icecream soda and chose a seat near the window
As he had expected it was not long before he saw Rose go across the courthouse yard toward her office on the north side of the square
He liked the swift easy way in which she walked
She had been walking the first time he had ever seen her thirteen years before when her father had led his family uptown from the station the day of their arrival in Fallon
Patrick Conroy had come from Sharon Illinois to perform the thankless task of starting a weekly newspaper in a town already undernourishing one
By sheer stubbornness he had at last established it
Twelve hundred subscribers their little printing jobs advertisers who bought liberal portions of space at ten cents an inchall had enabled him to give his children a living that was a shade better than an existence
He had died less than a year ago and Martin like the rest of the community had supposed the Fallon Independent would be sold or suspended
Instead as quietly and matteroffactly as she had filled her dead mothers place in the home while her brothers and sisters were growing up Rose stepped into her fathers business took over the editorship and with a boy to do the typesetting and presswork continued the paper without missing an issue
It even paid a little better than before partly because it flattered Fallons sense of Christian helpfulness to throw whatever it could in Roses way but chiefly because she made the Independent a livelier sheet with double the usual number of Personals
Yes decidedly Rose had force and push
Martins mind was made up
He would drop into the Independent ostensibly to extend his subscription but really to get on more intimate terms with the woman whom he had now firmly determined should become his wife
He drew a deep breath of relaxation and finished the glass of sweetness with that sense of selfconscious sheepishness which most men feel when they surrender to the sticky charms of an icecream soda
A few minutes later he stood beside Roses worn desk
Howdoyoudo once more Miss Rose of Sharon
Youre not the Bibles Rose of Sharon are you
he joshed a bit awkwardly
If I were a rose of anywhere Id soon wilt in this stuffy little office of inky smells she answered pleasantly
A rose would need petals of leather to get by here
A rose by rights belongs out of doorsMartin indicated the direction of his farmout there where the sun shines and theres no smells except the rich healthy smells of nature
A merry twinkle appeared in Roses eyes
Arent roses out thereand her gesture was in the same directionrather apt to be crowded down by the weeds
Not if there was a good strong man abouta man who wanted to cultivate the soil and give the rose a pretty place in which to bloom
Why Martin Rose laughed lightly the way youre fixed out there with that shack the only thing that ever blooms is a fine crop of ragweeds
At this gratuitous thrust a flood of crimson surged up Martins magnificent columnlike throat and broke in hot waves over his cheeks
Well its not going to be that way for long he announced evenly
Im going to plant a rosea real rose there soon and everything is going to be rightgarden house and all
Is this your way of telling me youre going to be married
Kinda
The only trouble is I havent got my rose yet
Well if I cant have that item at least I can print something about the selling of your coal rights
People will be interested because it shows the operators are coming in our direction
Here in Fallon we can hardly realize all that this sudden new promotion may mean
From that conversation I heard at the bank I guess you got the regulation hundred an acre
Yes and a good part of it is going into a firstclass modern house with a heating plant and running hot and cold water in a tiledfloor bathroom and a concrete cellar for the womans preserved things and builtin cupboards lots of closets a big garret and hardwood floors and fancy paper on the walls and the prettiest polished golden oak furniture you can buy in Kansas City not to mention a big fireplace and wide sunny porches
A rose ought to be happy in a garden like that dont you think
Folksll say Ive gone crazy when they see my building spree but I know what Im about
Its time I married and the woman who decides to be my wife is going to be glad to stay with me See here Martin Wade what ARE you driving at
What does all this talk mean anyway
Do you want me to give you a boost with someone
Youve hit it
Who is she
Rose asked with genuine curiosity
You he said bluntly
Well of all the proposals
Theres nothing to beat around the bush about
Im only thirtyfour a hard worker with a tidy sum to bootnot that Im boasting about it
But Martin what makes you think I could make you happy
Martin felt embarrassed
He was not looking for happiness but merely for more of the physical comforts and an escape from loneliness
He was practical he fancied he knew about what could be expected from marriage just as he knew exactly how many steers and hogs his farm could support
This was a new ideahappiness
It had never entered into his calculations
Life as he knew it was hard
There was no happiness in those fields when burned by the hot August winds the soil breaking into cakes that left crevices which seemed to groan for water
That sky with its clouds that gave no rain was a hard sky
The people he knew were sometimes contented but he could not remember ever having known any to whom the word happy could be applied
His father and mother they had been a good husband and wife
But happy
They had been far too absorbed in the bitter struggle for a livelihood to have time to think of happiness
This had been equally true of the elder Malls was true today of Nellie and her husband
A man and a woman needed each others help could make a more successful fight go farther together than either could alone
To Martin that was the whole matter in a nutshell and Roses gentle question threw him into momentary confusion
I dont know he answered uneasily
We both like to make a success of things and wed have plenty to do with
Wed make a pretty good pulling team
Rose considered this thoughtfully
Perhaps the people who work together best are the happiest
But somehow Id never pictured myself on a farm
Of course I dont expect you to make up your mind right away Martin conceded
Its something to study over
Ill come around to your place tomorrow evening after I get the chores done up and we can talk some more
So far as Martin was concerned the matter was clinched
He felt not the slightest doubt but that it was merely a question of time before Rose would consent to his proposition
After he had left she reviewed it a little sadly
It wasnt the kind of marriage of which she had always dreamed
She realized that she was capable of profound devotion of responding with her whole being to a deep love
But was it probable that this love would ever come
She thought over the men of Fallon and its neighborhood
There were few as handsome as Martinnot one with such generous plans
She knew her own domestic talents
She was a born housekeeper and homemaker
It had been a curious destiny that had driven her into a newspaper office and at that very moment there lay on her desk like a whisper from Fate the written offer from the rival paper to buy her out for fifteen hundred dollars giving herself a position on the consolidated staff
She had been pondering over this proposal when Martin interrupted her
It wasnt as if she were younger or likely to start somewhere else
She would live out her life in Fallon that she knew
There was little chance of her meeting new men and those established enough to make marriage with them desirable were already married
Candidly she admitted that if she turned Martin Wade down now she might never have another such opportunity
If only she could feel that he cared for herloved her
But wasnt the fact that he was asking her to be his wife proof of that
It was very strange
She had never suspected that Martin had ever felt drawn to her
With a sigh she pressed her large capable hands to her heart
Its deep piercing ache brought tears to her eyes
She felt bitterly that she was being cheated of too much that was sweet and preciousit was all wrongshe would be making a mistake
For a moment she was overwhelmed
Then the practical common sense that had been instilled into her from her earliest consciousness even as it had been instilled into Martin reasserted itself
After all perhaps he was rightthe busy people were the happy people
Many couples who began marriage madly in love ended in the divorce courts
Martin was kind and it would be wonderful to have the home he had described
She imagined herself mistress of it thrilled with the warm hospitality she would radiate entertained already at missionary meetings and at club
At least she would be less lonely
It would be a fuller life than now
What was she getting really getting alone out of this world
She and Martin would be good partners
Poor boy
What a long hard cheerless existence he had led
Tenderness welled in her heart and stilled its pain
Perhaps his emotions were far deeper than he could express in words
His way was to plan for her comfort
Wasnt there something big about his simple cardsonthetable wooing
And he had called her his rose his Rose of Sharon
The new house was to be the garden in which she should blossom
To be sure he had said it all awkwardly but Rose who was devout knew the stately Song of Solomon and as she recalled the magnificent outburst of passion she almost let herself be convinced that Martin was a poetlover in the rough
And all the while giving pattern to her flying thoughts the contents of a letter received the day before echoed through her mind
Her sister Norah the youngest of the family had told of her first baby
We have named her for you darling she wrote
Oh Rose she has brought me such deep happiness
I wonder if this ecstasy can last
Her little hand against my breastit is so warm and softlike a flowers curling petal as delicate and as beautiful as a butterflys wing
I never knew until now what life really meant
As Rose reread the throbbing lines and pictured the eagereyed young mother her own sweet face glowed with reflected joy and with the knowledge that this ecstasy this deeper understanding could come to her tooMartin he was vigorous so worthy of being the father of her children
He would love them of course and provide for them better than any other man she knew
Had not Norah married a plain farmer who was only a tenant
The new little Roses father was not to be compared to Martin and yet he had brought the supreme experience to her sister
So Rose sat dreaming the arid level of monotonous days which one short hour ago had stretched before her flowering into fragrant sunfilled fields
Meanwhile Martin congratulated himself upon having found a woman as sensible industrious and free from foolish notions as even he could wish
III DUST IN HER HEART SIX weeks later Martin and Rose were married
Martin had let the contract for the new house and barn to Silas Fletcher Fallons leading carpenter who had the science of construction reduced to utter simplicity
He had listened to Martins description of what he wished and after some rough figuring had proceeded to draw the plans on the back of a large envelope
Both Rose and Martin knew that those rude lines would serve unfailingly
For three thousand dollars Fletcher would build the very house Martin had pictured to Rose a twostory one with four nice rooms and a bath upstairs four rooms and a pantry downstairs a floored garret concrete cellar an inviting fireplace and wide porches
For two thousand dollars he would give a substantial barn capable of holding a hundred tons of hay and of accommodating twenty cows and four horses
Rose had been deeply touched by the thoroughness of Martins plans by his unfailing consideration for her comfort
True there had been moments when her warm loving nature had been chilled
At such times misgivings had clamored and she had finally all but made up her mind to tell him that she could not go onthat it had all been a mistake
She would say to him she had decided Martin you are one of the kindest and best men and I could be happy with you if only you loved me but you dont really care for me and you never will
I feel it
Oh I do
and I could not bear itto live with you day in and day out and know that
But she had reckoned without her own goodness of heart
On the very evening on which she had quite determined to tell Martin this decision he also had arrived at one
As soon as he had entered Roses little parlor he had exclaimed with an enthusiasm unusual with him We broke the ground for your new garden today Rose of Sharon and Fletcher wants to see you
There are some more little things youll have to talk over with him
He understands that youre the one I want suited
Rose had felt suddenly reassured
Why she had asked herself contritely couldnt she let Martin express his love in his own way
Why was she always trying to measure his feelings for her by set standards
Ive been wondering he had gone on quickly what you would think of putting up with my old shack while the new house is being built
It wouldnt be as if you were going to live there for long and youd be right on hand to direct things
Why I could do that of course she had answered pleasantly
If youve lived there all these years I surely ought to be able to live there a few months but Martin I know what youre going to say he had interrupted hastily
You think we ought to wait a while longer but if were going to pull together for the rest of our lives why mightnt we just as well begin now
Why is one time any better than another
There had been a wistfulness so rarely in Martins voice that Rose had detected it instantly
After all why should she keep him waiting when he needed her so much she had thought tenderly all the sweet womanliness in her astir with yearnings to lift the cloud of loneliness from his life
Rose had always believed love a breath of beauty that would hold its purity even in a hovel but she had not been prepared for the sordidness that seemed to envelop her as she crossed the threshold of the first home of her married life
Martin held in the clutch of the strained embarrassment that invariably laid its icy fingers around his heart whenever he found himself confronted by emotion had suggested that Rose go in while he put up the horse and fed the stock
Dont be scared if you find it pretty rough he had warned to which her light answer had lilted back Oh I shant mind
And as she stood in the doorway a moment later her eyes taking in one by one the murky windows the dirty floor the unwashed dishes the tumbled bed the rusty grease bespattered stove choked with cold ashes she told herself hotly that it was not the dirt nor even the desperate crassness that was smothering her joy
It was the fact that there was nowhere a touch to suggest preparation for her homecoming
Martin had made not even the crudest attempt to welcome her
It would have been as easy for Rose to be cheerful in the midst of mere squalor as for a flower to bloom white in a crowded tenement but at the swift realization of the lack of tenderness for her which this indifference to her first impressions so clearly expressed her faith in the man she had married began to wither
He had failed her in the very quality in which she had put her trust
Already he had carelessly dropped the thoughtfulness by which he had won her
She wondered how she could have made herself believe that Martin loved her
He has tried so hard in every way to show me how much I would mean to him she justified herself
But now he has me he just doesnt care what I think
As Rose forced herself to face this squarely something within her crumpled
Grim truth leered at her hurling dust on her bright wings of illusion poking cruel jests
This is your wedding day it taunted that tall figure out there near the dilapidated barn feeding his hogs is your husband
Oh first sweet most precious hours
How you will always like to remember them
Here in this dirty shanty you will enter into loves fulfillment
How romantic
Why doesnt your heart leap and your arms ache for your new passion
Tears pushed against her eyelids
Her new life was not going to be happy
Of this she was suddenly irrevocably certain
Rose struggled against a complete breakdown
This was no time for a scene
What was the matter with her anyway
Of course Martin had not meant to disappoint her nor deliberately hurt her
He probably thought this first home so temporary it didnt count
She simply would not mope
Of that she was positive and a brave little smile swimming up from her troubled heart she set about with much energy to achieve order valiantly fighting back her insistent tears as she worked
Meanwhile Martin totally oblivious of any cause for storm was making trips to and from the barrel which contained shorts mixed with water skimmed milk and house slops the screaming scrambling shoats gulping the porkmaking mixture as rapidly as he could fetch it
He worked unconsciously thinking typically not of Roses reaction to this new life but of what it held in store for himself
He glanced toward the shack
Already the mere fact of a womans presence beneath its roof seemed to him to give it a different aspect
Through the open door he observed that Rose was sweeping
How he had always hated the thought of any one handling what was his
He dumped another bucket of slops into the homemade trough
Why couldnt she just let things alone and get supper quietly
Heaven only knew what he had gotten himself into
But of one thing he was miserably certain never again would he have that comfortable seclusion to which he had grown so accustomed
He had known this would be true but the sight of Rose and her broom brought the realization of it home to him with an all too irritating vividness
Yes everything was going to be different
There would be many changes and he would never know what to expect next
Why had he brought this upon himself had he not lived alone for years
He had let the habit of obtaining whatever he started after get the better of him
Even today he could have drawn back from this marriage
But he had sensed that Rose was about to do so herself and this knowledge had pushed his determination to the final notch
Martin shook his head ruefully
This is The Song of Songs he smiled and there is my Rose of Sharon
Guess I was never intended for a Solomon
Now that she was so close to him in the very core of his life this woman frightened him instead of desire there was dread
He wished Rose had been a man that he might go into that shack and eat ham and eggs with him while they talked crops and politics and animals
There would be no thrills in this opening chapter and he if not his wife would be shaken
Martin was mental an incurable individualist who found himself sufficient unto himself
He was different from his neighbors in that he was always thinking asking questions and pondering over his conclusions
He had convinced himself that each demand of the body was useless except the food that nourished it the clothes that warmed it and the sleep that repaired it
He hated soft things and the twist in his mind that was Martin proved to him their futility
Love
It was an empty dream a shell that fooled
Its joys were fleeting
There was but one thing worth while and that was work
The body was made for itthe thumb to hold the hammer the hand to pump the water and drive the horses the legs to follow the plow herd the cattle and chase the pigs from the cornfield the ears to listen for strange noises from the stock the eyes to watch for weeds and discover the lice on the hens the mouth to yell the food call to the calves the back to carry the bran
Work meant money and money meantwhat
It was merely a stick that measured the amount of work done
Then why did he toil so hard and save so scrupulously
His answer was always another question
What was there in life that could enable one to forget it faster
That woman in there waiting for himoh she would suffer before she realized the truth of this lesson he had already learned and Martin felt a little pity for her
When he went in for supper Rose was just beginning to prepare it
With a catch of anger in his manner he gave her a sharp look and saw that she had been crying
He couldnt remember ever before having had to deal with a weeping woman even when Benny had died and his mother had been so shaken she had not given way to tears so this was to be another of the new experiences which must trot in with marriage
It annoyed him
Whats the matter Rose
Nothing at all Martin
Nothing
You dont cry about nothing do you
No
Rose felt a sudden fear she sensed a lack of pity in Martin an unwillingness even to try to understand her conflicting emotions
Then youre crying about something
What is it
There was command in his question
Martin was losing patience
He knew tears were used as weapons by women but why in the world should Rose need any sort of weapon on the first day of their marriage
He hadnt done anything to her said anything unkind
Was she going to be unreasonable
Now he was sure it was all wrong
Whats the matter
he demanded his voice rising
Nothings the matter
Im just a little nervous
Rose began to cry afresh
If only Martin had come to her and put his arms around her she would have been able to throw off her newlyborn fear of him and this disheartening shattering of her faith in his kindness
But he was going to the other extreme growing harder as she was becoming more panicky
Nervous
Whats there to be nervous about
Roses answer was stifled sobbing
Youre not sorry you married today I hope
She shook her head
Then whats this mean anyway
I was wondering if we are going to be happy after all Happy
You dont like this place
Thats the trouble
I was afraid of this but I thought you knew what you were about when you said you could stand it for a while
Oh it isnt the house itself Martin she hastened to correct truthfully sure that she had gone too far
IIknow well be happy
Again this talk about happiness
He did not like it
He had never hunted for happiness and he was contented
Why should she persist in this eternal search for this impossible condition
He supposed that occasionally children found themselves in it but surely grownups could not expect it
The nearest they could approach it was in forgetting that there was such a state by finding solace in constant occupation
Lets eat he announced
Im sick of this wrangling
Seems to me youre not starting off just right
Rose hastened to prepare the meal finding it more difficult to be cheerful as she realized how indifferent Martin was to her feelings if only she presented a smooth surface
He had not seemed even to notice how orderly and freshened everything was
She thought of the new experience soon to be hers
Could it make up for all the understanding and friendly appreciation that she saw only too clearly would be missing in her daily life
Resolutely she suppressed her doubts
Martin bothered by an odd feeling of strangeness in the midst of his own familiar surroundings smoked his pipe in silence and studied Rose soberly
Why he asked himself was he unmoved by a woman who was so attractive
He liked the deftness with which her hands worked the pie dough the quick way she moved between stove and table yet mingled with this admiration was a slight but distinct hostility
How can one like and have an aversion to a person at the same time
he pondered
I suppose he concluded grimly its because Im supposed to love and adore herto pretend a lot of extravagant feelings
His mind travelled to the stock in the pasture
How stolid they were and how matter of fact and how sensible
They affected no high nonsensical sentiments
Werent they after all to be envied rooted as they were in their solid simplicity
Why should human beings everlastingly try so hard to be different
He and Rose would have to get down to a genuine basis and the quicker the better
Meanwhile he must remember that whether he was glad or sorry she was there in his shack because he had asked her to come
As he ate his second helping of the excellent meal he said pleasantly You do know how to cook Rose
Her soft grayblue eyes brightened
I love to do it she answered quickly
You must tell me the things you like best Martin
If I had a real stove with a good oven I could do much better
Could you
Well get one tomorrow
Thatll be fine
she smiled eager to have all serene between them and as she passed him to get some coffee her hand touched his in a swift caress
Instantly Martins cordiality vanished his hostility toward her surged
Even as a boy he had hated to be fussed over
Well he had married and he would go through with it
If only Rose would be more matter of fact not look at him with that expression which made him think of a confiding child
What business had a grown woman with such trust in her eyes anyway
It was quite gone in the early dawn as Rose sat on the edge of the bed looking at her husband
Never had she felt so far from him so certain that he did not love her as when she had lain quivering but impassive in his arms
I might be just any woman she had told herself astounded and stricken to find how little she was touched by this experience which she had always believed bound heart to heart and crowned the sweet transfusion of affection from soul into soul
It doesnt make any more difference to him who I am than who cooks for him
Not that Martin had been unkind except negatively
Intuitively Rose understood that their first evening and night foreshadowed their whole lives
Not in what Martin would do but in what he would not do would lie her heartaches
Yet in her sad reflections there was no bitterness toward him he had disappointed her but perhaps it was only because she had taught herself to expect something rare even spiritual from marriage
Her idealism had played her a trick
With the quiet relinquishment of this longcherished dream eagerness for the realization of an even more precious one took possession of her
She comforted herself with the thought that maybe life had brought Martin merely as a door to the citadel which looms sparkling with dancing sunlight in the midst of mysterious shadows
Motherhoodshe would feel as if she were in another world
Out of all this disappointment would come her ultimate happiness
Always struggling toward happiness she was cheered too as the foundation for the house progressed
Everything would be so different she told herself once they were in their pretty new home
It was true she had given up a concrete floor for her cellar but she had seen at once the good sense of having the concrete in the barn instead
Martin was right
While it would have been nice in the house of course it would not have begun to be the constant blessing to herself that it would now be to him
How much easier it would make keeping the barn clean
Why it was almost a duty in a dairy barn to have such a floor and really she herself could manage almost as well with the dirt bottom
But when Martin began to discuss eliminating the whole upper story of the house Rose protested
You wont use it he had returned reasonably
Ill keep my word but when a body gets to figuring and sees all that can be built with that same money it seems mighty foolish to put it into something that you dont really need
As Martin looked at her questioningly Rose felt suddenly unable to muster an argument for the additional sleepingrooms
It was true that they were not actually necessary for their comfort but the house as it had been decided upon was so interwoven with memories of her courtship and all that was lovable in Martin it had become so real to her that it was as if some dear possession were being torn to pieces before her eyes
I dont know why Martin she had answered with a choky little laugh but it seems as if I just cant bear to give it up
Why
IIlike it all so well the way you planned it
Just liking a thing isnt always good reason for having it
Itll make lots more for you to take care of
What would you say if I was to prove to you that it would build a fine chickenhouse one for the herd boar a concrete tank down in the pasture thatd save the cows enough trips to the barn to make em give a heap sight more milk a cooling house for it and a good tool room
Roses eyes opened wide
I can prove it to you
That was all
But the shack filled with his disapproval of her reluctance to free him from his promise
She remembered one time when she had come home from school in a pelting rain that had changed suddenly to hail
There had seemed no escape from the hard little balls and their cruel bruises
Just so it seemed to her from Martin outwardly so calm as he read his paper the harsh determined thoughts beat thick and fast
Turn what way she would they surrounded enveloped and pounded down upon her
Her resolution weakened
Wasnt she paying too big a price for what was after all only material
The one time she and Martin had seemed quite close had been the moment in which she had agreed so quickly to change the location of the concrete floor
Now she had utterly lost him
She could scarcely endure the aloofness with which he had withdrawn into himself
Martin she said a bit huskily two evenings later at supper Ive decided that you are right
It is foolish and extravagant of me to want a second story when there are just the two of us
It will be better to have all those other things you told me about
Martin did not respond simply continued eating without looking up
This was a habit of his that nearly drove Rose desperate
In her fathers household meals had always been friendly sociable affairs
Patrick Conroy had been loquacious and by way of a wit sharpened on his Roses own had developed
They had dealt in delicious nonsense these two and had her husband been of a different temperament she might have found it a refuge in her life with him
But somehow from the first even before they were married when with Martin such chatter had died unuttered on Roses tongue
The few remarks which she did venture nowadays had the effect of a disconcerting splash before they sank into the gloomy depths of the thick silence
Occasionally in sheer self defense she carried on a light monologue but Martins lack of interest gave her such an odd lonely stagestruck sensation that she too became untalkative keeping to herself the ideas which chased through her everactive mind
Innately just she attributed this peculiarity of his to the fact that he had lived so long alone and while it fretted her she usually forgave him
But tonight as no answer came it seemed to her that if Martin did not at least raise his eyes she must scream or throw something
It would be a godsend to be the sort who permits oneself to do such things she told herself a suggestion of a smile touching her lips and mentally she sent dish after dish at him watching them fall shattered to the floor
Dismay at the relief this gave her brought the dimples into her cheeks
Her voice was pleasant as she asked Martin did you hear your spouse just now
Annoyance flitted across his face and crept into his tone as he answered tersely Of course I heard you
Presently he finished his meal pushed back his chair and went out
Nothing further was said between them on the subject but when the scaffolding went up she saw that it was for only one story
It might have comforted her a little had she known what uneasy moments Martin was having
In spite of himself he could not shake off the consciousness that he had broken his word
That was something which heretofore he had never done
But heretofore his promises had been of a strictly business nature
He would deliver so many bushels of wheat at such and such a time he would lend such and such a piece of machinery he would supply so many men and so many teams at a neighbors threshing he would pay so much per pound for hogs he would guarantee so many eggs out of a setting or so many pounds of butter in so many months from a cow he was selling
A few such guarantees made good at a loss to himself a few such loads delivered in adverse weather a few such pledges of help kept when he was obliged actually to hire men had established for him an enviable reputation which Martin was of no mind to lose
Had Rose not released him from his promise he would have kept it
Even now he was disturbed as to what Fletcher and Fallon might think
But already he had lived long enough with his wife to understand something of the quality of her pride
Once having agreed to the change she would carry it off with a dash
Had Rose stood her ground on this matter undoubtedly all her after life might have been different but she was of those women whose charm and whose folly lie in their sensitiveness to the moods and contentment of the people most closely associated with them
They can rise above their own discomfort or depression but they are utterly unable to disregard that of those near them
This gave Martin who by temperament and habit considered only his own feelings an incalculable advantage
His was the old supremacy of the selfish over the self sacrificing the hard over the tender the mental over the emotional
Add to this the fact that with all his faults perhaps largely because of them perhaps chiefly because she cooked washed ironed mended and baked for him kept his home and planned so continually for his pleasure Martin was dear to Rose and it is not difficult to understand how unequal the contest in which she was matched when her wishes clashed with her husbands
It was predestined that he invariably should win out
Rose told her friends she and her husband had decided that the second story would make her too much work and Martin noticed with surprise how easily her convincing statement was accepted
He decided for his own peace of mind that he had nothing with which to reproach himself
He had put it up to her and she had agreed
This principal concession obtained other smaller ones followed logically and rapidly
The running water and bath in the house were given up for piping to the barn and stanchionsthen novelties in southeastern Kansas
The money for the hardwood floors went into lightning rods
Builtin cupboards were dismissed as luxuries and the saving paid for an implement shed which delighted Martin who had figured how much expensive machinery would be saved from rust
When it came to papering the walls he decided that the white plaster was attractive enough and could serve for years
Instead he bought a patented littercarrier that made the job of removing manure from the barn an easy task
The porches purchased everything from a brace and bit to a lathe for the new toolroom and put the finishing touches to the dairy
The result was a fourroom house that was the old one born again and such wellequipped farm buildings that they were the pride of the township
Rose who had surrendered long since let the promises go to naught without much protest
Martin was so quietly domineering so stubbornly persistentand always so plausibleoh so plausible
that there was no resisting him
Only when it came to the fireplace did she make a last stand
She felt that it would be such a friendly spirit in the house
She pictured Martin and herself sitting beside it in the winter evenings
A house without one is like a place without flowers she explained to him
Its a mighty dirty business he answered tersely
You would have to track the coal through the rest of the house and youd have all those extra ashes to clean out
But you would never see any of the dirt she argued with more than her usual courage and if I wouldnt mind the ashes I dont see why you should
We cant afford it
Martin Ive given in to you on everything else she asserted firmly
Im not going to give this up
Ill pay for it out of my own money
What do you mean out of my own money
he asked sternly
I told Osborne wed run one account
If what is mine is going to be yours what is yours is going to be mine
Id think your own sense of fairness would tell you that
As a matter of fact Martin had no intention of ever touching Roses little capital but he had made up his mind to direct the spending of its income
He would keep her from putting it into just such foolishnesses as this fireplace
But Rose listening saw the last of her independence going
She felt tricked outraged
During the years she had been at the head of her fathers household she had regulated the family budget and no matter how small it had happened to be she always had contrived to have a surplus
This notion of Martins that he and he alone should decide upon expenditures was ridiculous
She told him so and in spite of himself he was impressed
All right he said calmly
You can do all the buying for the house
Write a check with my name and sign your own initials
Get what you think we need
But there isnt going to be any fireplace
You can just set that down
Voice eyes the line of his chin all told Rose that he would not yield
Nothing could be gained from a quarrel except deeper ill feeling
With a supreme effort of will she obeyed the dictates of common sense and ended the argument abruptly
But for months after she was settled in the new little house her eye never fell on the space where the fireplace should have been without a bitter feeling of revolt sweeping over her
She never carried a heavy bucket in from the pump without thinking cynically of Martins promises of running water
As she swept the dust out of her front and back doors to narrow steps she remembered the spacious porches that were to have been and as she wiped the floors she had painted herself and polished her pine furniture she was taunted by memories of the smooth boards and the golden oak to which she had once looked forward so happily
This resentment was seldom expressed but its flame scorched her soul
Her work increased steadily
She did not object to this it kept her from thinking and brooding it helped her to forget all that might have been all that was
She milked half the cows separated the cream took charge of the dairy house and washed all the cans
Three times a week she churned and her butter became locally famous
She took over completely both the chickens and the garden
Often because her feet ached from being on them such long hours she worked barefoot in the soft dirt
According to the season she canned vegetables preserved fruit rendered lard and put down pork
When she sat at meals now like Martin she was too tired for conversation
From the time she arose in the morning until she dropped off to sleep at night her thoughts like his were chiefly of immediate duties to be performed
One concept dominated their householdwork
It seemed to offer the only way out of lifes perplexities
IV ROSEBUD IN THE DUST UNDER this rigid regime Martins prosperity increased
Although he would not have admitted it Roses good cooking and the sweet fresh cleanliness with which he was surrounded had their effect giving him a new sense of physical wellbeing making his mind more alert
Always he had been a hard worker but now he began for the first time to take an interest in the scientific aspects of farming
He subscribed for farm journals and put real thought into all he did with results that were gratifying
He grew the finest crop of wheat for miles around in the season which brought others a yield of fifteen or twenty bushels to the acre Martin averaged thirtythree without buying a ton of commercial fertilizer
His corn was higher than anybodys else the ears longer the stalks juicier because of his careful intelligent cultivating
In the driest season it resisted the hot winds this he explained was the result of his knowing how to prepare his seed bed and when to plant moisture could be retained if the soil was handled scientifically
He bought the spoiled acreage of his neighbors which he cut up for the siloas yet the only one in the countyadding water to help fermentation
His imported hogs seemed to justify the prices he paid for them growing faster and rounder and fatter than any in the surrounding county
The chinch bugs might bother everyone else but Martin seemed to be able to guard against them with fair success
He took correspondence courses in soils and fertilizers animal husbandry and every related subject kept a steady stream of letters flowing to and from both Washington and the State Agricultural College
Now and then it crossed his mind that with the farm developing into such an institution it would be more than desirable to pass it on to one of his own blood and secretly he was pleased when Rose told him a baby was coming
A child a son might bring with him a little of what was missing in his marriage with her
She irritated him more and more not by what she did but by what she was
Her whole temperament in so much as he permitted himself to be aware of it her whole nature jarred on his
When is it due
October
Its lucky harvest will be over silo filling too was his only comment
In spite of Roses three long years with Martin his lack of enthusiasm was like a sharp stab
What had she expected she asked herself sternly
To be taken in his arms and rejoiced over as others were at such a moment
What did he care so long as he wouldnt have to hire extra help for her in the busy season
It was incrediblehis hardness
Why couldnt she hate him
He was mean enough to her surely
Im as foolish as old Rover she thought bitterly
The faithful dog lived for his master and yet Rose could not remember ever having seen Martin give him a pat
When I once hold my own little baby in my arms I wont care like this
Ill have someone else to fill my heart she consoled herself thrilling anew with the conviction that then she would be more than recompensed for everything
The love she had missed the house that had been stolen from herwhat were they in comparison to this growing bit of life
Meanwhile she longed as never before to feel near to Martin
She could not help recalling how gallantly her father had watched over her mother when she carried her last child and how eagerly they all had waited upon her
At times the contrast was scarcely to be borne
Rose was troubled with nausea but Martin poohpoohed as childish the notion of dropping some of her responsibilities
Didnt his mares work almost to the day of foaling
It was good for them keeping them in shape
And the cowsdidnt they go about placidly until within a few hours of bringing their calves
Even the sowsdid they droop as they neared farrowing
Why should a woman be so different
Her child would be healthier and she able to bring it into the world with less discomfort to herself if she went about her ordinary duties in her usual way
Thus Martin impersonally logically
That would be true Rose agreed if the work werent so heavy and if I were younger
Its the work youre used to doing all the time isnt it
Because you arent young is all the more reason you need the exercise
Youre not going to hire extra help so you might just as well get any todo out of your mind he retorted the dreaded note in his voice
She considered leaving him
If she had earned her living before she could again
More than once she had thought of doing this but always the hope of a child had shone like a tiny bright star through the midnight of her trials
Since she had endured so much why not endure a little longer and reap a dear reward
Then too she could never quite bring herself to face the pictures her imagination conjured of Martin struggling along uncared for
Now as her heart hardened against him an inner voice whispered that everyone had a right to a father as well as a mother and Martin might be greatly softened by daily contact with a little son or daughter
In fairness she must wait
Yet she knew these were not her real reasons
They lay far deeper in the very warp and woof of her nature
She did not leave Martin because she could not
She was incapable of making drastic changes of tearing herself from anyone to whom she was tied by habit and affectionno matter how bitterly the mood of the moment might demand it
Always she would be bound by circumstances
True however hard and adverse they might prove she could adapt herself to them with rare patience and dignity but never would she be able to compel them to her will rise superbly above them toss them aside
Her life had been and would be shaped largely by others
Her mothers death the particular enterprise in which her fathers little capital had been invested Martins peculiar temperament these had moulded and were moulding Rose Wade
At the time she came to Martins shack she was potentially any one of a half dozen women
It was inevitable that the particular one into which she would evolve should be determined by the type of man she might happen to marry inevitable that she would become to a large degree what he wished and expected that her thoughts would take on the complexion of his
Lacking in strength of character
In power of resistance certainly
Time out of mind such malleability has been the cross of the Magdalenes
Yet in what else lies the secret of the harmony achieved by successful wives
And as her nausea passing Rose began to feel a glorious sensation of vigor she decided that perhaps after all Martin had been right
Childbearing was a natural function
People probably made far too much fuss about it
Nellie came to help her cook for the threshers and for the rest she managed very well even milking her usual eight cows and carrying her share of the foaming buckets
All might have gone smoothly if only she had not overslept one morning in late September
When she reached the barn Martin was irritable
She did not answer him but sat down quietly by her first cow a fineblooded animal which soon showed signs of restlessness under her tense hands
There
There
So Bossy soothed Rose gently
You never will learn how to manage good stock Martin criticized bitingly
Nor you how to treat a wife
Oh shut up
Dont talk to me that way
As she started to rise a kick from the cow caught her square on the stomach with such force that it sent her staggering backward still clutching the handle of the pail from which a snowy stream cascaded
Now what have you done
demanded Martin sternly
Havent I warned you time and again that milk cows are sensitive nervous
Fidgety people drive them crazy
Why cant you behave simply and directly with them
Why is it I always get more milk from mine
Its your own fault this happenedfussing around taking out your ill temper at me on her
Shouting at me
What could you expect
For the first time in their life together Rose was frankly unnerved
It seemed to her that she would go mad
You devil
she burst out wildly
Thats what you are Martin Wade
Youre not human
Your child may be lost and you talk about cows letting down more milk
Oh God
I didnt know there was any one living who could be so cruel so cold so diabolical
Youll be punished for this some dayyou willyou will
You dont love menever did oh dont I know it
But some time you will love some one
Then youll understand what it is to be treated like this when your whole soul is in need of tenderness
Youll see then what Oh shut up growled Martin somewhat abashed by the violence of her broken words and gasping sobs
Youre hysterical
Youre doing yourself as much harm right now as that kick did you
Oh Martin please be kind pleaded Rose more quietly
Please
Its your baby as much as mine
Be just half as kind as you are to these cows
They have more sense he retorted angrily
And when Rose woke him the following night to go for the doctor his quick exclamation was So now youve done it have you
As the sound of his horses hoofs died away it seemed to her that he had taken the very heart out of her courage
She thought with anguished envy of the women whose husbands loved them for whom the heights and depths of this ordeal were as real as for their wives
It seemed to her that even the severest of pain could be wholly bearable if in the midst of it one felt cherished
Well she would go through it alone as she had gone through everything else since their marriage
She would try to forget Martin
She WOULD forget him
She must
She would keep her mind fixed on the deep joy so soon to be hers
Had she not chosen to suffer of her own free will because the little creature that could be won only through it was worth so much more than anything else the world had to offer
She imagined the baby already arrived and visualized him as she hoped her child might be at two years
Suppose he were in a burning house would she have the courage to rescue him
What would be the limit of her endurance in the flames
She laughed to herself at the absurdity of the question
How well she knew its answer
She wished with passionate intensity that she could look into the magic depths of some fairy mirror and see for just the flash of one instant exactly how her boy or girl really would look
How much easier that would make it to hold fast to the consciousness that she was not merely in pain but was laboring to bring forth a warm fleshandblood child
There was the rubin spite of her eagerness the little one so priceless wasnt as yet quite definite real
She recalled the rosychecked curlyhaired youngster her fancy had created a moment ago
She would cling to that picture yes even if her pain mounted to agony it should be of the body only she would not let it get into her mind not into her soul not into the welcoming motherheart of her
Meanwhile as she armored her spirit she built a fire put on water to heat attended capably to innumerable details
Rose was a woman of sound experience
She had been with others at such times
It held no goblin terrors for her
Had it not been for Martins heartlessness she would have felt wholly equal to the occasion
As it was she made little commotion
Dr Bradley gentle and direct had been the Conroys family physician for years
Nellie who arrived in an hour had been through the experience often herself and was friendly and helpful
She liked Rose admired her tremendously and the thoughtan odd one for Nelliecrossed her mind that tonight she was downright beautiful
When at dawn Dr Bradley whispered She has been so brave Mrs
Mall I cant bear to tell her the child is not alive
Wouldnt it be better for you to do so
She shrank from the task
I cant I simply cant she protested honest tears pouring down her thin face
Could you Mr
Wade
Martin strode into Roses room all his own disappointment adding bitterness to his words Well I knew youd done it and you have
Its a fine boy but he came dead
Out of the dreariness and the toil out of the hope the suffering and the high courage had comenothing
As Rose lay the little still form clasped against her she was too broken for tears
Life had played her another trick
Indignation toward Martin gathered volume with her returning strength
You dont deserve a child she told him bitterly
You might treat him when he grew up as you treat me
Ive never laid hand to you said Martin gruffly certain stinging words of Nellies still smarting
When she chose his sisters tongue could be waspish
She had tormented him with it all the way to her home
He had been goaded into flaring back and both had been thoroughly angry when they separated yet he was conscious that he came nearer a feeling of affection for her than for any living person
Well not affection precisely he corrected
It was rather that he relished with a quizzical amusement the completeness of their mutual comprehension
She was growing to be more like their mother too
Decidedly this was the type of woman he should have married not someone soft and eager and full of silly sentiment like Rose
Why didnt she hold her own as Nellie did
Have more snap and stamina
It was exasperatingthe way she frequently made him feel as if he actually were trampling on something defenseless
He now frankly hated her
There was not dislike merely there was acute antipathy
He took a delight in having her work harder and harder
It used to be Rose but now it was always say or you or hey
Once she asked cynically if he had ever heard of a Rose of Sharon to which he maliciously replied She turned out to be a Ragweed
Yet such a leveller of emotions and an adjuster of disparate dispositions is Time that when they rounded their fourth year Martin viewed his life with a few reservations as fairly satisfactory
He turned the matter over judicially in his mind and concluded that even though he cared not a jot for Rose at least he could think of no other woman who could carry a larger share of the drudgery in their dusty lives help save more and on the whole bother him less
He like his ragweed had settled down to an apathetic jog
Rose was convinced that Martin would make too unkind a father he had no wish for another taste of the general confusion and disorganized routine her confinement had entailed
Besides it would be inconvenient if she were to die as Dr Bradley quite solemnly had warned him she might only too probably
Without any exchange of words it was settled there should not be another childsettled he dismissed it
In a way he had come to appreciate Rose but it was absurd to compliment anyone let alone a wife whom he saw constantly
Physically she did not interest him in fact the whole business bored him
It was tiresome and got one nowhere
He decided this state of mind must be rather general among married people and reasoned his way to the conclusion that marriage was a good thing in that it drove out passion and placed human animals on a more practicable foundation
If there had been the likelihood of children he undoubtedly would have sought her from time to time but with that hope out of their lives the attraction died completely
When he was through with his work it was late and he was sleepy
When he woke early in the morning he had to hurry to his stock
So that which always had been less than secondary now became completely quiescent and he was satisfied that it should
It never occurred to him to consider what Rose might be thinking and feeling
She wondered about it and would have liked to ask advice from someonethe older Mrs
Mall or Dr Bradleybut habitual reserve held her back
After all she decided finally what did it matter
Meanwhile financially things were going better than ever
Martin had the most improved farm in the neighborhood he was looked up to by everyone as one of the most intelligent men in the county and his earnings were swelling going into better stock and the surplus into mortgages which he accumulated with surprising rapidity
Occasionally he would wonder why he was working so hard saving so assiduously and investing so consistently
His growing fortune seemed to mean little now that his affluence was thoroughly established
For whom was he working
he would ask himself
For the life of him he could not answer
Surely not for his Ragweed of Sharon
Nellie
She was well enough fixed and he didnt care a shot for her husband
Then why
Sometimes he pursued this chain of thought further Ill die and probably leave five times as much as I have now to her and who knows what shell do with it
Ill never enjoy any of it myself
Im not such a fool as to expect it
What difference can a few thousand dollars more or less make to me from now on
Then why do I scheme and slave
Pshaw
Ive known the answer ever since I first turned the soil of this farm
The man who thinks about things knows theres nothing to life
Its all a grinding chase for the day when someone will pat my cheek with a spade
He might have escaped this materialism through the church but to him it offered no inducements
He could find nothing spiritual in it
In his opinion it was a very carnal institution conducted by very hypocritical men and women
He smiled at their Hell and despised their Heaven
Their religion to him seemed such a crudely selfish affair
They were always expecting something from God always praying for petty favorsbegging and whining for money or good crops or better health
Martin would have none of this nonsense
He was as selfish as they probably more so he conceded but he hoped he would never reach the point of currying favor with anyone even God
With his own good strength he would answer his own prayers
This farm was the nearest he would ever come to a paradise and on it he would be his own God
Rose did not share these feelings
She went to church each Sunday and read her Bible daily with a simple faith that defied derision
Once when she was gone Martin idly hunted out the Song of Solomon
His lips curled with contempt at the passionate rhapsody
He knew a thing or two he allowed about these wonderful Roses of Sharon and this Song of Songs
Lies all lies every word of it
Yet in spite of himself from time to time he liked to reread it
He fancied this was because of the sardonic pleasure its superlative phrases gave him but the truth was it held him
He despised sentiment tenderness and by the strangeness of the human mind he went by way of paradox to the tenderest most sublime spot in a book supreme in tenderness and sublimity
At forty he owned and with the aid of two hired hands worked an entire section of land
The law said it was his and he had the might to back up the law
On these six hundred and forty broad acres he could have lived without the rest of the world
Here he was King
Other farms he regarded as foreign countries their owners with impersonal suspicion
Yet he trusted them after a fashion because he had learned from many and devious dealings with a large assortment of people that the average human being is honest which is to say that he does not steal his neighbors stock nor fail to pay his just debts if given plenty of time and the conditions have the explicitness of black and white
He knew them to be as mercenary as himself with this only difference Where he was frankly so they pretended otherwise
They bothered him with their dinky deals with their scrimping and scratching and their sneaky attempts to hide their ugliness by the observance of one set day of sanctuary
Because they seemed to him so twofaced so trifling so cowardly he liked to stick them every time he had a fair chance and could do it within the law
It was his favorite game
They worked so blindly and went on so stupidly talking so foolishly that it afforded him sport to come along and take the bacon away from them
All held him a little in awe for he was of a forbidding bearing tall grave and thoughtful accurate in his facts and sure of himself slow to express an opinion but positive in his conclusions seeking no favors and giving none careful not to offend indifferent whether he pleased
He would deceive but never insult
The women were afraid of him because he never jollied
He had no jokes or bright remarks for them
They were such useless creatures out of their particular duties
There was nothing to take up with them
Everyone rendered him much the same respectful manner that they kept on tap for the leading citizens of the town David Robinson for instance
Indeed Martin himself was somewhat of a banker for he was a stockholder and director of the First State Bank where he was looked up to as a shrewd man who was too big even for the operation of his magnificent farm
He understood values
When it came to loans his judgment on land and livestock was never disputed
If he wanted to make a purchase he did not go to several stores for prices
He knew in the first place what he should pay and the business men especially the hardware and implement dealers were afraid of his knowledge and still more of his influence
About Rose too there was a poise an atmosphere of background which inspired respect above her station
When Mrs Wade said anything her statement was apt to settle the matter for on those subjects which she discussed at all she was an authority and on those which she was not her training in Martins household had taught her to maintain a wise silence
The stern selfcontrol had stolen something of the tenderness from her lips
There were other changes
The sunlight had faded from her hair the once firm white neck was beginning to lose its resilience
Deep lines furrowed her cheeks from mouth to jaw and fine wrinkles had slipped into her forehead
There were delicate webs of them about her patient eyes under which lack of sleep and overwork had left their brown shadows
Since the birth of her baby she had become much heavier and though she was still neat her dresses were always of dark colors and made up by herself of cheap materials
For while she bought without consulting Martin her privilege of discretion was confined within strict and narrow limits
He kept a meticulous eye on all her cancelled checks and knew to a penny what she spent
If he felt a respect for her thrift it was completely unacknowledged
They worked together with as little liking as little hatred as two oxen pulling a plow
It had been a wise day for both thought Fallon when they had decided to marrythey were so well mated
What a model and enviable couple they were
To Rose it seemed the essence of irony that her life with Martin should be looked upon as a flower of matrimony
Yet womanlike she took an unconfessed comfort in the fact that this was sothat no one unless it were Nellie was sufficiently astute to fathom the truth
To be sure the Wades were never spoken of as happy
They were invariably alluded to as good folks true blue solid people ideal husband and wife or salt of the earth
Each year they gave a round sum to the church and Martin took caustic gratification in the fact that although his attitude toward it and religion was well known he too was counted as one of the fold
To do its leaders justice he admitted that this might have been partly through their hesitancy to hurt Rose who was always to be found in the thick of its saledinners bazaars and sociables
How she was able to accomplish so much without neglecting her own heavy duties which now included cooking washing mending and keeping in order the old shack for the hired men was a topic upon which other women feasted with appreciative gusto especially at missionary meetings when she was not present
It really was extraordinary how much she managed to put into a day
Early as Martin was up to feed his stock she was up still earlier that she might lend a hand to a neighbor harrowed by the fear that gathered fruit might perish
Late as he plowed in the hot summer evenings her sweaty fingers were busy still later with patching brought home to boost along some young wife struggling with a teething baby
She seemed never too rushed to tuck in an extra baking for someone even more rushed than herself or to make delicious broths and tasty dishes for sick folk
In her quiet way she became a real power always in demand the first to be entrusted with sweet secrets the first to be sent for in paralysing emergencies and moments of sorrow
The warmth of heart which Martin ridiculed and resented intensified by its very repression bubbled out to others in cheery helpfulness and blessed her quick tears
Of her deep yearning for love she never spoke
Just when she would begin to feel almost selfsufficient it would quicken to a throbbing ache
Usually at such times she buried it determinedly under work
But one day yielding to an impulse she wrote to Norah asking if her little namesake could come for a months visit
I know she is only seven the letter ran but I am sure if she were put in care of the conductor she would come through safely and I do so want to see her
After long hesitation she enclosed a check to cover expenses
She was half frightened by her own daring and did not tell Martin until she had received the reply giving the date for the childs arrival
I earned that Martin she returned determinedly to his emphatic remonstrance
And when the check comes in its going to be honored
A Wade check is always honored was his cryptic assertion
I merely say he added more calmly that if we are to board her and I dont make any protest over that at all it seems to me only fair that her father should have bought the ticket
Maybe youre rightin theory
But then she simply couldnt have come and Ive never seen her
I first knew of her the very day you asked me to marry you
Ive thought of her often and often
Her mother named her after me and calls her Little Rose of Sharon Illinois
Another ragweed probably said Martin shortly
Yet to his own surprise he was not altogether sorry she was to comethis house of his had never had a child in it for more than a few hours
He was rather curious to find out how it would seem
If only her name were not Rose and if only she were not coming from Sharon
But little Rose with her dark brown curls merry expression roguish nose and soft radiance swept all his misgivings and prejudices before her
One might as well hold grudges against a flower he thought
He liked the confiding way she had of suddenly slipping her little hand into his great one
Her prattle amused him and he was both flattered and worried by the fearlessness with which she followed him everywhere
She seemed to bring a veritable shower of song into this home of long silences
The very chaos made Mrs Wades heart beat tumultuously and once when Martin came upon the little girl seated solemnly in the midst of a circle of corncob dolls his throat contracted with an extraordinary tightness
You really are a rosea lovely sweet brown Rose of Sharon he had exclaimed forgetting his wifes presence and not stopping to think how strange the words must sound on his lips
If youll give me a kiss Ill let you ride on old Jettie
The child scrambled to her feet and seated on his broad shoulder granted the demand for toll
Her aunts eyes filled
This was the first time she had ever heard Martin ask for something as sentimental as a kiss
She was thoroughly ashamed of herself for itit was really too absurdbut she felt jealousy an emotion that had never bothered her since they had been married
And this bit of chattering femininity had caused it
Mrs Wade worked faster
The kiss was like the touch of silk against Martins cheek
He felt inexplicably sad as he put the child down again among her playthings
There was he realized with a shock much that he was missing things he was letting work supplant
He wished that boy of theirs could have lived
All might have been different
He had almost forgotten that disappointment had never understood until this moment what a misfortune it had been and here he was being gripped by a more poignant sense of loss than he had ever before felt even when he had lost his mother
Wonderful as little Rose was she was not his own
But he wondered suddenly wasnt this aching sense of need perhaps something utterly different from unsatisfied paternal instinct
He turned his head toward the kitchen where his Ragweed was working and asked himself if she were gone and some other woman were heresuch as little Rose might be when she grew up one to whom he went out spontaneously would not his life be more complete and far more worth while
What a fool he was to bother his head with such getnowhere questions
He dismissed them roughly but new processes of thought had been opened new emotions awakened
Meanwhile little Roses response to his clumsy tenderness taught him many unsuspected lessons
He never would have believed the pleasure there could be in simply watching a childs eyes light with glee over a fivecent bag of candy
It began to be a regular thing for him to bring one home from Fallon each trip and the gay hunts that followed as she searched for itsometimes to find the treasure in Martins hat sometimes under the buggy seat sometimes in a knobby hump under the tablecloth at her platemore than once brought his rare smile
For years afterward the memory of one evening lingered with him
He was resting in an old chair tipped back against the house thinking deeply when the little girl tired from her play climbed into his lap and making a cozy nest for herself in the crook of his arm fell asleep
He had finished planning out the work upon which he had been concentrating and had been about to take her into the house when he suddenly became aware of the childs loveliness
In the silvery moonlight all the fairy flowerlike quality of her was enhanced
Martin studied her closely reverently
It was his first conscious worship of beauty
Leaning down to the rosy lips he listened to the almost imperceptible breathing he touched the long sweeping lashes resting on the smooth cheeks and lifted one of the curls the wind had been ruffling lightly against his face
With his whole soul he marvelled at her softness and relaxation
A profound pitying rebellion gripped him at the idea that anything so sweet so perfect must pass slowly through the defacing furnaces of time and pain
Little Rose of Sharon
he thought gently conscious of an actual tearing at his heart even a startling stinging in his eyes
With an abruptness that almost awakened her he carried her in to his wife
Mrs Wade felt an inexplicable hurt at the decidedness of little Roses preference for Martin
She could not understand it
She took exquisite care of her cooked the things she liked best let her mess to her hearts content in the kitchen made her dolls pretty frocks cuddled her told her stories and stopped her work to play with her on rainy daysbut she could not win the same affection the little girl bestowed so lavishly on Martin
If left to herself she was always to be found with the big silent man
As the months visit lengthened into three it was astonishing what good times they had together
If he was pitching hay her slender little figure short dress aflutter was to be seen standing on the fragrant wagonload
At threshing time she darted lightly all over the separator Martins watchful eye constantly upon her and his protective hand near her
She went with him to haul the grain to mill and was fascinated by the big scales
On the way there and back he let her hold the great lines in her little fists
In the dewy mornings she hopskipped and jumped by his side into the pasture to bring in the cows
She flitted in and out among them during milking time
I think she makes them too nervous Martin Rose had once remarked
Better run out darling until we finish and then come help auntie in the dairy
They might as well get used to her he had answered tersely
Itll hurt her feelings to be sent away
Rose could scarcely believe her ears
Memories bitter intolerable crowded upon her
Had the little girl really changed Martin so completely
Oh if only her boy could have lived
Perhaps she had made a great mistake in being so determined not to have another
Was it too late now
She looked at her husband
Well as she knew every detail of his fine clean cut features his broad shoulders and rippling muscles they gave her a sudden thrill
It was as if she were seeing him again for the first time in years
If only he could let a shadow of this new thoughtfulness and kindliness fall on her they might even yet bring some joy into each others lives
They had stepped off on the wrong foot
Why they really hadnt been even acquainted
They had been led into thinking so because of the length of time they had both been familiar figures in the same community
Beyond a doubt if they were being married today and she understood him as she did now she could make a success of their marriage
But as it was Martin was so fixed in the groove of his attitude of utter indifference toward her that she felt there was little chance of ever jogging him out of it
To Rose the very fact that the possibility of happiness seemed so nearly within reach was what put the cruel edge to their present status
She did not comprehend that Martin definitely did not want it changed
Conscious at last that he was slowly starving for a womans love beginning to brood because there was no beauty in his life he was looking at her with eyes as newly appraising as her own
He remembered her as she had been that day in the bank when he had thought her like a rose
She had been all white and gold then now hair eyes skin and clothes seemed to him to be of one earthy color
Her clean dull calico dress belted in by her checked apron revealed the ungraceful lines of her figure
She looked middleaged and unshapely when he wanted youth and an exquisite loveliness
Well he told himself harshly he was not likely to get it
There was no sense in harboring such notions
They must be crushed
He would work harder much harder hard enough to forget them
There was but one thing worth whilehis farm
He would develop it to its limits
Accordingly when little Rose returned to Sharon he and his Ragweed soon settled themselves to the old formula of endless toil investing the profits in sound farm mortgages that were beginning to tax the capacity of his huge tin box in the vault of the First State Bank
V DUST BEGETS DUST YET through the Wades busy days the echo of little Roses visit lingered persistently
Each now anxiously wanted another child but both were careful to keep this longing locked in their separate bosoms
Their constraint with each other was of far too long a standing to permit of any sudden exchange of confidences
It was with this hope halfacknowledged however and in her mind the recent memories of a more approachable Martin that Rose began to make a greater effort with her appearance
By dint of the most skillful maneuvering she contrived to purchase herself a silk dressthe first since her marriage
It was of dark blue crepedechine simply but becomingly made the very richness of its folds shedding a new luster over her quiet graciousness and large proportions
Even her kind capable hands seemed subtly ennobled as they emerged from the luscious well fitting sleeves and the high collar with its narrow edge of lace stressed the nobility of her fine head
When she came home from church she did not as she would have heretofore change at once into calico but protected by a spick and span white apron kept on the best frock through dinner and frequently until chore time in the afternoon
In the winter too she was exposed less to sun and wind and her skin lost much of its weathered look
She took better care of it and was more careful with the arrangement of her hair
Gradually a new series of impressions began to register on Martins brain
One Sunday she came in fresh and ruddy from the drive home in the cold crisp air
Martin found it rather pleasant to watch her brisk movements as she prepared the delayed meal
He observed with something of a mental start that today at least she still had more than a little of the old sumptuous fullblown quality
It reminded him together with the deft way in which she hurried without haste without flurry of their first evening in the shack nearly seven years ago
How tense they both had been how afraid of each other how she had irritated him
Well he had grown accustomed to her at last thanks be
Was he perhaps foolish not to get more out of their lifeit was not improbable that a child might come
Why had he been taking it so for granted that this was out of the question
When one got right down to it just what was the imaginary obstacle that was blocking the realization of this deep wish
Her chance of not pulling through
Hed get her a hired girl this time and let her have her own head about things
Shed made it all right once why not again
The settledness of their habitual neutrality
What of it
He would ignore that
It wasnt as if he had to court her make explanations
She was his wife
He didnt love her never had never would but life was too short to be overly fastidious
It was flying flying in a few more years he would be fifty
Fifty
And what had it all been about anyway
He did have this farm to show for his workhe had not made a bad job of that he and his Ragweed
In her own fashion she was a good sort and better looking than most women past forty
Rose felt the closeness of his scrutiny sensed the unusual cordiality of his mood but from the depths of her hardly won wisdom took no apparent notice of it
She knew well enough how not to annoy him
If only she had not learned too late
What was it about Martin she wondered afresh that had held her through all these deadening years
Her love for him was like a stream that disappearing for long periods underground seemed utterly lost only to emerge again unexpectedly cleared of all past murkiness tranquil and deep
This unspoken converging of minds equivocal though it was on Martins part resulted gradually in a more friendly period
Rose always liked to remember that winter with its peace that quenched her thirsty heart and helped to blur the recollection of old unkindnesses long since forgiven but still too vividly recalled
When a year later Billy was born she was swept up to that dizzy crest of rapture which to finely attuned souls is the recompense and justification of all their valleys
Martin watched her deep almost painful delight with a profound envy
He had looked forward with more anticipation than even he himself had realized to the thrill which he had supposed fatherhood would bring taking it entirely for granted that he would feel a bond with this small reincarnation of his own being but after the first week of attempting to get interested in the unresponsive bundle that was his son he decided the idea of a baby had certainly signified in his mind emotions which this tiny troublesome creature with a voice like a smallsized foghorn did not cause to materialize
No doubt when it grew into a child he would feel very differently toward itmore as he did toward little Rose but that was a long time to wait and meanwhile he could not shake off a feeling of acute disappointment of defeated hopes
By the end of the second month he was sure he must have been out of his senses to bring such a nuisance upon himself and into his wellordered house
Not only was his rest disturbed with trying regularity by night and his meals served with an equally trying irregularity by day but he was obliged to deal with an altogether changed wife
For yielding as Rose was in all other matters where Billy was concerned she was simply imperturbable
At times as she held the chubby little fellow to her breast or caught and kissed a waving pink foot she would feel a sense of physical weakness come over herit seemed as if her breath would leave her
Martin could be what he might life at last was worth its price
With the courage of her motherlove she could resist anything and everyone
To her the relative importance of the farm to Billy was as simple as a problem in addition
She had lost none of her old knack for turning off large amounts of work quickly but she firmly stopped just short of the point where her milk might be impaired by her exertions
Martin had insisted that the requirement for hired help was over however in despair over his wifes determined sabotage it was Martin himself who commanded that the girl be reinstated for another two months
Rose was a methodical mother and not overly fussy
As soon as Billy could sit in a highchair or an ordinary packing box on the floor she kept him with her while she went about her different tasks cooing and laughing with him as she worked but when he needed attention she could disregard calling dishes chickens halfchurned butter unfinished ironing unmilked cows or an irate husband with a placidity that was worthy of the old Greek gods
Martin was dumbfounded to the point of stupefaction
He was too thoroughly selfcentred however to let other than his own preferences long dominate his Ragweeds actions
Her first duty was clearly to administer to his comfort and that was precisely what she would do
It was ridiculous the amount of time she gave to that babyout of all rhyme and reason
If she wasnt feeding him she was changing him if she wasnt bathing him she was rocking him to sleep
And there at last Martin found a tangible point of resistance for he discovered from Nellie that not only was it not necessary to rock a baby but that it was contrary to the new ideas currently endorsed
Reinforced he argued the matter adding that he could remember distinctly his own mother had never rocked Benny
Yes and Benny died
It wasnt her fault if he did he retorted a trifle disconcerted
I dont know about that
She took chances I would never take with Billy
She sacrificed him with her eyes open for you and Nelliegave him up so that you could have this farm
Martin did not care for this new version
What has that to do with the question
he demanded coldly
Just thisyour mother had her ideas and I have mine
I am going to raise Billy in my own way
But for weeks thereafter she managed with an almost miraculous adroitness to have him asleep at meal times
At seven months Billy was the most adorable smiling cuddly baby imaginable with dimples four teeth and a tantalizing hint of curl in his soft surprisingly thick fawncolored hair
Already it was quite evident that he had his mothers sensitive affectionate nature
If only his father had picked him up occasionally had talked to him now and then he scarcely could have resisted the little fellows crowing sweettempered responsive charm but resentment at the annoyance of his presence was now excessive
For the present Martins only concern in his son consisted in seeing to it that his effacement was as nearly complete as possible
The longimpending clash came one evening after a sultry dusty day when Rose occupied with a large washing in the morning and heavy work in the dairy in the afternoon realized with compunction that never had she come so near to neglecting her boy
Tired and hot from fretting he had been slow about going to sleep and was just dozing off when Martin came in worn out and hungry
Isnt supper ready yet
All but frying the sausage Rose answered achieving a pleasant tone in spite of her jadedness
Hes almost turning the cornerhear his little sleepy song
Sit down and cool off
Ill have it ready by the time you and the boys are washed
Under its thick coat of tan Martins face went white
Ive had enough of this he announced levelly
Youll put him down and fry that meat
Wait just a minute she coaxed hell be off for the night and if you wake him hell cry and get all worked up
You heard what I said
His tone was vibrant with determination
How am I going to keep hired men if you treat them like this
When they come in to eat they want to find their food on the table
This doesnt often happen any more and they know good and well I make it up to them in other ways returned Rose truthfully
For answer he crossed over to her quickly reached down and took the baby from her
What are you going to do with him
she demanded atremble with rage and a sense of impotent helplessness as avoiding her quick movement Martin went into the bedroom
Let him go to sleep as other children do while you finish getting supper
Do you want to make a sissy of him
A lot you care what he becomes
she flashed conflicting impulses contending for mastery as Billy now thoroughly awake and seeing his mother began to cry pleading to her with big blue eyes and outstretched arms to take him
She started forward but Martin stepped between herself and the crib
Martin Wade let me pass
Hes mine
It isnt going to hurt him to cry
He does it often enough
If you had a really cross baby around youd know how good and reasonable Billy is she flamed torn by the little sobs
You get out to that kitchen he ordered more openly angry than Rose had ever seen him
Ive had enough of this talk do you hear and enough of this way of doing
Dont you set foot in here again till suppers over
Ive had quite enough too of jumping up and down to wait on myself
Confusedly Rose thought of her countless hours of lost sleep her even yet unrecovered strength the enormous readjustment of her own life in her sincere efforts to do her best by the whole household her joyous acceptance of all the perpetual selfdenial her new duties to Billy necessitated
In comparison the inconveniences to which Martin had been put seemed trifling
The occasional delays and the unusual bother of stepping to the stove now and then to pour himself and the men a hot cup of coffeethis was their sum total
And how injured he really felt
The injustice of it left her speechless
Nails biting into her hands in her struggle for selfcontrol she left the room
With a slam of the door behind him Martin followed her
Blindly she strove for reason
Billy would simply cry himself to sleepit was bad for his whole nervous system but it would not actually make him sick
What a chaos must be in that little heart
His mother had failed him for the first time in his life
It was cruel the way Martin had forced her to this and as she listened for the next half hour to the muffled sound of Billys crying and saw how impervious to it Martin was she knew that never again could things be the same between her husband and herself
But when supper over she found the corners of the rosebud mouth still pathetically down and Billys breath still quivering in long gasps she gathered the snuggly body to her and vowed in little broken lovewords that from now on his father should have no further opportunities for discipline
Knowing him as she did she should have trained the baby in the first place to go to sleep alone should have denied herself those added sweet moments
After this she would be on her guard forestall Martin do tenderly what he would do harshly
Never again should her boy be made to suffer through any such mistaken selfishness of hers
And though after a while the importance of this episode shrank to its true proportions she never forgot or broke this promise
It would have been literally impossible for her to touch Billy even when he was naughtiest and most exasperating with other than infinite love but she had an even firmness of her own
As sensitive as herself adoring her to the point of worship he was easily punished by her displeasure or five minutes of enforced quiet on a chair
The note of dread in her voice as she pleaded Hush oh hush Billy be good quick darling papas coming was always effective
By ceaseless vigilance and indefatigable patience she evaded further open rupture until the boy was three years old
His shrieks had brought both his father and herself flying to the hog barn to find him dancing up and down as frightened and aghast he vainly attempted to beat off old Dorcas a mammoth sow from one of her dayold litter on which having crushed it by accident she was now quite deliberately feasting
God Almighty
stormed Martin hastily putting the little pigs back into the next pen
Who let them in to her
Thats her old trick
I opened the door confessed Billy troubled frank eyes looking straight into his fathers
They were hungry that one wanted her most
And at the thought of the tragedy he had witnessed he flung himself heartbroken into his mothers comforting arms
Ill whip you for this said Martin sternly
Oh please
protested Rose gathering the child closer
Cant you see hes had a bitter enough lesson
His little heart is full
Hes got to learn once and for all not to meddle with the stock
Come here
No
I wont have it
Ill see to it that he never does a thing like this again
Hes too young to understand
Hes never been struck in his life
You shant
Martins cold blue eyes looked icily into his wifes blazing gray ones
Dont act like a fool
Suppose he had gotten in there himself and had fallen down do you think shed have waited to kill him
Whered he be nowlike that
and he pointed to the halfeaten carcass
Rose shuddered
There it was againthe same familiar disarming plausibility of Martins the old trick of making her seem to be the one in the wrong
I wish I had an acre for every good thrashing I got when I was a boy he commented drily
But in those days a father who demanded obedience wasnt considered a monster
If you only loved him I wouldnt care sobbed Rose
I could stand it better to have you hit him in anger but youre so hard so cruel
You plan it all out sohow can you
Nevertheless with a last convulsive hug and a broken Mother cant help it darling she put Billy on his feet her tormented heart wrung with bitterness as Martin took the clinging child from her and carried him away hysterical and resisting
What else could I do
she asked herself miserably stabbed by the added fear that Billy might not forgive her
Could he understand how powerless she had been
When once more the child was cuddled against her she realized that in some mystical way there was a new bond between them and as the days passed she discovered it was not so much the whipping but the unnatural perfidy of Dorcas that had scarred his mind
With his own eyes he had seen a mother devour her baby
He woke from dreams of it at night
Even the sight of her in the pasture contentedly suckling the remaining nine did not reassure him
The modern methods of psychology were then to such women as Rose a sealed book but love and intuition taught her to apply them
You see Billy she explained hogs are meant to eat meat like dogs or bears or tigers
But they can live on just grain and grass and that is what most farmers make them do because there is so much more of it and it costs so much less
Some of them feed what is called tankage
If old Dorcas could have had some of that she probably would not have eaten the little pig
You mustnt blame her too much for she was just famishing for flesh the way you are sometimes for a drink of water when youve been playing hard
Thus rationalized the old sows conduct lost some of its grewsomeness and in time of course the shock of the whole experience was submerged under other and newer impressions but always the remembrance of it floated near the surface of his consciousness his first outstanding memory of his father and the farm
Inheriting a splendid physique from both parents at six little Bill was as tall as the average child of eight well set up and sturdy afraid of nothing on the place except Martin who resenting his attitude not unreasonably put the blame for it on his wife
Its not what I do to him he told her its what you teach him to think I might do that makes him dislike me
To which Rose looked volumes but made no reply
Whatever the reason for the childs distrust and honestly as he tried not to let it affect his feeling for his son Martin found himself as much repelled by it as he had once been drawn to little Rose by her sweet faith and affection
Yet in spite of the only too slightly veiled enmity between them he was rather proud of the handsome lad and determined to give him a thorough stockmans and agriculturists training
Some day he would run this farm and Martin had put too much of his very blood into it not to make sure that the hands into which it would fall became competent
With almost impersonal approval he noticed the perfect coordination of the boys muscles his insatiable curiosity about machinery and his fondness for animals all of which only made his pronounced distaste for work just that much more aggravating
He was his father decided contemptuously a dreamer
Martin reached this conclusion early in his sons lifeBill was nineand he determined to grind the objectionable tendency out of him
The youngster had a way of stopping for no reason whatever and just standing there
For all his iron selfcontrol it nearly drove the energetic man to violence
He would leave Bill in the barn to shovel the manure into the littercarriera good fifteenminute job he would return in half an hour to find him sitting in the alleyway staring down into his idle scoop
God Almighty
Martin would explode
How many times must I tell you to do a thing
The boy would look up slowly like a frightened colt expecting a blow his nonresistance as angering as his indolence
Gazing at the enormous imposing person who was his father he would simply wait with wide open eyeseyes that reminded Martin of a calf begging for a bucket of milk
Im asking you
Answer when I speak
Have you lost the use of your tongue
What are you anyway a lump of jelly
Didnt I tell you to clean this barn
Its fly time and no wonder the cows suffer and slack up on their milk when there is a lazy bones like you around who wont even help haul away the manure
I was just agoin to
You should have been through long ago
What are you good for is what Id like to find out
You eat a big bellyful and what do you give in return
Do you expect to go through the world like thishaving other people do your work for you
If this job isnt finished in fifteen minutes Ill whip you
Bill would work swiftly and painfully for the carrier was high and hard for him to manipulate
But he would do his best desperate over the threat his whole nature rebelling not so much at the task as at the interruption of the pleasant stream of pictures which had been flowing so excitingly through his mind
Always it was like thisjust when he was most blissfully happy he was jerked back to some mean dirty job by the stern driving demands of his tireless father
Without regard to the fact that harness is heavy and a horses back high Martin would order him to hitch up
He was perfectly aware that it was too much for the child but lack of affection and a vague extenuating belief that especially trying jobs developed one made him merciless
The boy frequently boiled with rage but he was so weaponless so completely in his fathers powerthere was no escape from this tyranny
He knew he could not live without him even his mother could not do that
His mother
What a sense of rest would come over him when he sat in her capacious lap his head on her soft shoulder
With her cheek against his and her kind hand gently patting the back of his still chubby one something hard in him always melted away
Why do I love you so mama he asked once and hate papa so
Mrs Wade realized what was in his sore heart and hers ached for him but she answered quietly You mustnt hate anybody dear
You shouldnt
I dont hate anybody but him
I hate him and Im afraid of himjust like you are
Oh Billy cried Rose shocked to the quick
You must never never say I hate your fatherwhen youre older youll understand
He is a wonderful man
Hes mean said Billy succinctly
When I get big Im going to run away
From me
Oh darling dont think such thoughts
Papa doesnt intend to be mean
He just doesnt know what fun it is to play
You see dear when he was a boy like you he had to work oh ever and ever so much more than you doyes he did she nodded solemnly at Bills incredulous stare
And his mother never talked with him or held him close as I do you
She didnt have time
Aunt Nellie has told me all about it
He just worked and worked and workedthey all did
Thats all there was in their lifejust work
Why when he was your age his father was at war and papa and Grandmother Wade had to do everything
He did a mans share at fourteen and by the time he was fifteen he ran this whole farm
Work has gotten to be a habit with him and its made him different from a great many people
But he thinks that is why hes gone ahead and so hes trying to raise you the same way
If he really didnt care about you Billy it wouldnt bother him what you did
In the silence that fell they could hear old Molly bellowing with pathetic monotony for her calf that had been taken from her
Yesterday she had been so proud so happy
She had had such a hard time bringing it into the world too
Martin had been obliged to tie a rope to its protruding legs and pull with all his strength
It didnt seem fair to think that the trustingeyed little fellow had been snatched from her so soon as if her pain had been an entirely negligible incident
Already after six short weeks he was hanging drawn and quartered in one of Fallons meatmarkets
I hate this place
burst out the boy passionately
I hate it
All farms are cruel agreed his mother quickly
But I suppose they have to be
People must have milk and they must have veal
At nine though his fingers would become cramped and his wrists would pain him Bill had three cows to account for twice a day
At five in the morning he would be shaken by Martin and told to hurry up
It would be dark when he stepped out into the chill air and he would draw back with a shiver
Somewhere on these six hundred acres was the herd and it was his chore to find it and bring it in
He would go struggling through the pasture unable to see twentyfive feet ahead of him the cold dew or snow soaking through his overalls his shoes becoming wet
Often he would go a mile north only to have to wander to another end of the farm before he located them
Other times when he was lucky they would be waiting within a hundred yards of the barn
Oh how precious the warm bed was and how his growing body craved a few more hours of sleep
He had a trick of pulling the sheet up over his head as if thus he could shut out the world but always his father was there to rout him out from this nest and set him none too gently on his feet always there was a herd to be brought in and udders to be emptied
It made no difference to Martin that the daily walk to and from the district school was long and left no spare time it made no difference that the long hours at his lessons left the boy longing for playalways there was the herd twice a day cows and cows without end
At twelve Bill was plowing behind four heavy horses
He could run a mower and clean a pasture of weeds in a day
He could cultivate and handle the manure spreader
In the hot blazing sun he could shock wheat behind Martin who sat on the binder and cut the beautiful swaying gold
There wasnt a thing he could not do but there was not one that he did with a willing heart
His dreams were all of escape from this grinding harsh farm
It seemed to him that it was as ruthless as his father that everything it demanded of him was at best just a little beyond his strength
If there was a lever to be pulled on the disk very likely it was rusted and refused to give unless he yanked until he was short of breath and his heart beat fast four horses were so unruly and hard to keep in place the gates were all so heavythey were not easy to lift and then drag open
It was such a bitter struggle every step of the way
It was so hard to plow as deeply as he was commanded
It was so wearing to make the seed bed smooth enough to measure up to his fathers standard
Never was there a person who saw less to love about a farm than this son of Martins
He even ceased to take any interest in the little colts
You used to be foolish about them Martin taunted cried whenever I broke one
If I dont get to liking em I dont care what happens to em Bill answered with his fathers own laconicism
This chickenheartedness as he dubbed it disgusted Martin who consequently took a satisfaction in compelling the boy to assist him actively whenever there were cattle to be dehorned wire rings to be pushed through bunches of pigs snouts calves to be delivered by force young stuff to be castrated or butchering to be done
Often the sensitive lads nerves were strained to the breaking point by the inhuman torture he was constantly forced to inflict upon creatures that had learned to trust him
There was a period when it seemed to him every hour brought new horrors with each one his determination strengthened to free himself as soon as possible from this life that was one round of toil and brutality
Rose gave him all the sympathy and help her great heart knew
His rebellion had been her own but she had allowed it to be ground out of her with her soul now in complete surrender
And here was her boy going through it all over again for himself learning the dull religion of toil from one of its most fanatical priests
What if Bill too should finally have acquiescence to Martin rubbed into his very marrow should absorb his fathers point of view grow up and run with mechanical obedience the farm he abhorred
The very possibility made her shudder
If only she could rescue him in some manner help him to break free from this bondage
Collegethat would be the open avenue
Martin would insist upon an agricultural course but she would use all her tact and rally all her powers that Billy might be given the opportunity to fit himself for some congenial occupation
Martin might even die and if she were to have the farm to sell and the interest from the investments to live on how happy she could be with this son of hers so like her in temperament
She caught herself up sharply
Well it was Martin himself who was driving her to such thoughts
You are like old Dorcas she once told her husband driven desperate by the exhausted harrowed look that was becoming habitual in Bills face
Youre trampling down your own flesh and blood thats what youre doingeating the heart out of your own boy
Go right on retorted Martin all his loneliness finding vent in his bitter sneer tell that to Bill
Youve turned him against me from the day he was born
A fine chance Ive ever had with my son
VI DUST IN HIS EYES SUCH was the relationship of the Wades when one morning the mail brought them a letter from Sharon Illinois
Rose wrote that she was miserably unhappy with her stepmother
Could she live with them until she found a job
She had been to business college and was a dandy stenographer
Maybe Uncle Martin could help her get located in Fallon
Of course I will if shes got her head set on working was his comment
Ill telegraph her to come right along
Might as well wire the fare too while Im about it and tell her to let us know exactly when she can get here
Mrs Wade looked up quickly at this unusual generosity yet she was she realized more startled than surprised
For had not little Rose been the one creature Martin had loved and to whom he had enjoyed giving pleasure
It had been charmingthe response of the big aloof man to the merry child of seven but that child was now a woman and in all probability a beautiful one
Wasnt there danger of far more complicated emotions which might prove even uprooting in their consequences
Mrs Wade blushed
Really she chided herself sternly she wouldnt have believed she could be such an old goosegoing out of her way to borrow trouble
If her husband was moved to be hospitable she ought to be wholly glad not petty enough to resent it
She would put such thoughts out of her mind indeed she would and welcome Rose as she would have wanted Norah to have welcomed Bill had the circumstances been reversed
It would be lovely to have the girl aboutshe would be so much company and the atmosphere of lighthearted youth which she would bring with her would be just what Billy needed
By the time Roses answer came saying she would arrive in two weeks her aunt was genuinely enthusiastic
I wonder said Martin if we could build on an extra room by then
If shes going to make this her home she cant be crowded as if she was just here for a short visit
Ill hunt up Fletcher this afternoon
Mrs Wades lips shut tight as she grappled with an altogether new kind of jealousy
To think that Martin should delight in giving to an outsider a pleasure he had persistently denied his own son
How often had she pleaded Its a shame to make Billy sleep in the parlor
A boy ought to have one spot to himself where he can keep his own little treasures
But always she had been met with a plausible excuse or a direct refusal
I suppose I ought to be thankful someone can strike an unselfish chord in him she thought wearily
Youll have to get some furniture Martin continued placidly
Mahoganys the thing nowadays
Its fearfully expensive she murmured
Oh I dont know
Might as well get something good while were buying
And while youre at it pick out some of those curtains that have flowers and birds on em and a pretty rug or two
Ill have Fletcher put down hard oak flooring and I guess it wont make much more of a mess if we go ahead and connect up the house with the rest of the Delco system
Its about time put in Bill who had been listening roundeyed until now actually more than half believing his father to be in cynical jest
Were known all over the county as the place that has electric lights in the barns and lamps in the house
It hasnt been convenient to do it before was the crisp answer
Bill and his mother exchanged expressive glances
When was anything ever convenient for Martin Wade unless he were to derive a direct personal satisfaction from it
Then it became a horse of quite another color
He could even become lavish everything must be of the best nothing else would do no expense as long as full value was received was too great
Mrs Wade found herself searching her memory
She was positive that not since those occasions upon which he had brought home the sacks of candy for the sheer sunshine of watching little Roses glee had anyones pleasure been of enough importance to him to become his own
All this present concern for her comfort talked far more plainly than words
This time Mrs Wade admitted bravely to herself that her jealousy was not for Billy
It would have been far easier for her if she had known that Martin was thinking of their coming guest as he had last seen her thirteen years before
He realized thoroughly that she must have grown up but before his mental eyes there still danced the roguish little girl he had held so tenderly in his arms and had so longed to protect and cherish
He experienced a distinct sense of shock therefore when tall slender and smartly dressed Rose stepped off the train and throwing her arms impulsively around his neck gave him an affectionate kiss
The feel of those soft warm lips lingered strangely setting his heart to pounding as he guided her down the platform
Uncle Martin you havent changed a bit
she exclaimed joyously
I was wondering if Id recognise youimagine
Somehow I thought thirteen years would make a lot of difference but you dont look a day older
You little blarney he smiled pleased nevertheless
Well here we are and he stopped before his fine Cadillac
Oh Uncle Martin gasped Rose ecstatically
What a perfectly gorgeous car
I thought all farmers were supposed to have Fords
They laughed happily together
Its the best in these parts he admitted complacently
Its too wonderful to think that it is really yours
Oh Uncle Martin do you suppose you could ever teach me to drive it
It takes a good deal of strength to shift the gears but you can have a try at it anyway tomorrow
Ohhh
she exulted slipping naturally into their old comradeship
Martin took her elbow as he helped her into the car
The firm young flesh felt goodit was hard to let go
His thumb and under finger had pressed the muscles slightly and they had moved under his touch
His hand trembled a bit
The grace with which she stepped up gave him another thrill
He was struck with her trim pump and the several inches of silk stocking that flashed before his eyes so unaccustomed to noticing dainty details gave him a mingled sensation of delight and embarrassment
It had been many a day many a year since he had consciously observed his wife
She was too useful for him to permit himself to be influenced by questions of beauty into underrating her value and he was a respectable husband if not a kind one
They had jogged on so long together that he would have said he had ceased to be conscious of her appearance
But suddenly he felt that he could not continue to endure for another day the sight of the spreading flat houseslippers which because of her two hundred and forty pounds and frequently rheumatic feet she wore about her work
Moreover it was forcibly borne in upon him just what a source of irritation they had been
And they were only as a drop in the bucket
Well such thoughts did no one any good
Thank heaven from now on he would have Rose to look at
They settled down beside each other in the front seat and he was aware that her lovely eyes so violetblue and ivorywhite were studying him admiringly
Here was a man she was deciding who for his age was the physical superior of any she had ever met
He was clearly one of those whom toil did not bend and while she concluded further he might be taken for all of his fiftyfour years it would be simply because of his austere manner
Martin sustained her scrutiny until they were well out of Fallon and speeding along on a good level road
Then with a teasing turn abouts fair play he too took a frank look oddly stirred by the sophisticated touches which added so subtly to her natural beauty
From her soft thick brown hair done up cleverly in the latest mode and her narrow eyebrows arched oh so carefully and penciled with such skill to that same trim provocative pump and disconcerting flash of silkclad ankle Rose had dash
Hers was that gift of style which is as unmistakable as the gift of song and which like it is sometimes to be found unexpectedly in any village or small town
Martin drank in every detail wonderingly with a kind of awe
All his life it seemed to him for the last thirteen years positively he had known that somewhere there must be just such a woman whose radiance would set his heart beating with the rapture of this moment and whose moods would blend so easily with his own that she would seem like a very part of himself
And here she was come true sitting right beside him in his own car
For the first time in his whole life Martin understood the meaning of the word happiness
It gripped and shook him and made his heart ache with a delicious pain
Its hard to believe he murmured such a very small girl went away and such a very grown up little woman has come back
Lets seetwenty is it
My you make me feel oldbut you say I havent changed much
You havent
A little bit of gray a number of tiny wrinkles about your eyesthe tips of two dainty fingers touched them lightlyand youre a bit thinnerthats all
Why you look so good to me Uncle Martin I could fall in love with you myself if you werent aunties husband
It was an innocent remark and he understood it as such but its effect on him was dynamic
You always were as pretty as a picture he said slowly his nerves tingling if a farmers opinion is worth anything in that line
This was twaddle of course and Martin knew it
Rather it was the city persons point of view he was inclined to belittle
He had the confidence in his superiority that comes from complete economic security and his pride of place was even more deeply rooted
Men of Martins class who are able to gaze in at least one direction as far as eye can see over their own land are shrewd sharp intelligent and far better informed on current events and phases of thought than the people of commercial centers even imagine
There is nothing of the peasant about them
Martin knew quite well that dressed in his best clothes and put among a crowd of strange business men he would be taken for one of their ownso easy was his bearing so naturally correct his speech
Something of all this had already registered in Roses mind
Come on Uncle Martin she laughed flatter me
I just love it
Very well then Ill say that youve come back as pretty a little woman as ever Ive laid eyes on
Is that all
Oh Uncle Martin just pretty
The boys usually say Im beautiful
You are beautifulas beautiful as a rose
Thats what you are a red red rose of Sharonwith your doves eyes your little white teeth like a flock of even sheep and your sweet pretty lips like a thread of scarlet
Why Uncle Martin
exclaimed the girl a trifle puzzled by the intensity of his quiet tone and stressing their relationship ever so lightly
Youre almost a poet
You mean old King Solomon was he retrieved himself quickly
Dont you ever read the Bible
I didnt know you did
Oh your old Uncle reads a little of everything he returned with a reassuring commonplaceness of manner
He was thunderstruck at his outburst
Never had he had occasion to talk in that vein
He remembered how blunt he had been with the older Rose twenty years beforehow he had jumped to the point at the start and landed safely clinched his wooing as he had since realized by calling her his Rose of Sharon and now he was saying the same thing over again but oh how differently
If only he were thirtyfour today and unmarried
You always were the most wonderful person beamed Rose completely at her ease once more I used to simply adore you and Im beginning to adore you again
Thats because you dont know what a glum old grouch I really am
Youa grouch
Oh Uncle Martin
Her merry infectious laugh left no doubt of how ridiculous such a notion seemed
Oh yes I am
Nonsense
Youll have to prove it to me
Ask your aunt or Bill theyll tell you
The acrimony in his tone did not escape her
Then theyll have to prove it to me she corrected her gaiety now a trifle forced
Aunt Rose never had appreciated him was her quick thought
Even as a child she had sensed that
How are they
she added quickly
Bill must be a great boy by this time
Only a few inches shorter than I am Martin answered indifferently
Hes one of the kind who get their growth earlyby the time hes fifteen hell be six feet
Im crazy to see them
Well theres your aunt now he resumed drily as they drew up before the little house that contrasted so conspicuously with the fine brick silos and imposing barns
Gleaming with windows they loomed out of the twilight reminding one in their slatecolored paint of magnificent battleships
The bright glare of the auto picked Mrs Wade out for them as mercilessly as a searchlight
Where she had been stout thirteen years before she was now frankly fat
Four keen eyes noted the soft cushiony double chin the heavy breasts ample stomach spreading hips and thick shoulders rounded from many years of bending over her kitchen table
Kansas wind Kansas wellwater and Kansas sun had played their usual havoc giving her skin the dull sand color so common in the Sunflower State
She had come from her cooking and she was hot beads of sweat trickling from the deep folds of her neck
Withal there was something so comfortable and motherly about her the kind wise eyes behind the goldrimmed glasses were so misty with welcome and unspoken thoughts of the dear mother Rose had lost that the girl went out to her sincerely even as she marvelled that the same years on the same farm which had given one person added polish and had made him even more good looking than ever could have changed another so completely and turned her into such a toilscarred frumpy oldish woman
Why when she had been talking with Uncle Martin he had seemed no older than herselfwell not quite that of course but she had just forgotten about his age altogetheruntil she saw Aunt Rose
No wonder whenever he spoke of his wife every intonation told how little he loved her
How could he care any morethat way
Roses first look of astonishment and her darting glance in his own direction were not lost on Martin
With an imperceptible smile he accepted the unintended compliment but he felt a pang when he noticed that to her Aunt went the same affectionate impetuous embrace that she had given to him at the station
Youre losing your head he told himself sternly driving into the garage where stopping his engine he continued to sit motionless at the wheel
That ought to be a lesson to you shes just naturally warmhearted and loving
Always was
Youre no more to her than anybody else
Well theres no fool like an old fool
Yet deeper than his admitted thought was the positive conviction that already something was up between them
If not why this excitement and wild happiness
To be sure nothing had been saidreally
It had all been so light
Rose was just a bit of a born flirt
But he having laughed at love all his life loved her deeply desperately
Well so much the worse for himselfit couldnt lead anywhere
Yet in spite of all his logic he knew that something was going to happen
Hang it alljust what
He was afraid to answer his own question not because of any dread of what his wife might dohe was conscious only of a new cold impersonal hatred toward her because she stood between him and his Rose nor was it qualms about his ability to win the girls heart
Already despite his inexperience with love technique he was in some mysterious manner making progress
The community his position in it
This was food for thought certainly but it was not what worried him
Then why this feeling of dismay when he wanted to be only glad
The question was still unanswered when he finally left the garage
With all his powers of introspection he had not yet fathomed the fact that it was a fear of his own until now utterly unsuspected capacity for recklessness
Heretofore he had been able to count on the certainty that his best judgment would govern all his actions
Now he felt himself clutching almost frantically at the hard sense of proportion that never before had so much as threatened to desert him
He went about his chores in a grave automatic way absorbed in anything but agriculture
Hardly ever did he pass through his barn without paying homage to his own progressiveness and oozing approval of the mechanical milker driven by his own electrical dynamo the James Way stanchions with electric lights above the individual drinking fountains at the head of each cow the corkbrick floors the scrupulously whitewashed walls and the absence of odor with the one exception of sweet fermented silage
But tonight he was not seeing these symbols of material superiority
Instead he was thinking of a girl with eyes as soft as a doves lips like a thread of scarlet and small white teeth as even as a flock of his own Shropshire sheep
What else did that old King Solomon say
God Almighty he thought there was a man who understood
Hed try to get a chance to reread that Song of Songs that was breaking his own heart with its joy and its sadness
His reverie was broken abruptly by the jangling supperbell
When he reached the back door Bill was already at the table and Rose in a simple gown that brought out the appealing lines of her slim young body was deftly helping his wife in the final dishing up
As Martin stood a moment looking in at the bright scene and listening to the happy chatter he heard her ask if he had got her a job
At sight of him she cried excitedly Oh Uncle Martin
You cant think how I adore my beautiful room
And Bill says it was you who first thought of building it for me
You old darling
You and Aunt Rose are the best people in the whole wide world
How can I ever thank you
Ill tell you he smiled forget all about that job and just stay around here and make us all young
Time enough to work when you have to
Mrs Wade noticed how Bills eyes widened at these words so unlike his father and soon she was acutely aware of her husbands marked agreeableness whenever he directed his conversation toward Rose
He even tried to include his son and herself in this new atmosphere but with each remark in their direction his manner changed subtly
Toward herself in particular his feelings were too deep for him to succeed in belying them
As the meal progressed she realized that her dim forebodings were fast materializing into a certain danger
Unless she acted promptly this slip of a girl was going to affect fundamentally all their lives
Already it seemed as though she had been amongst them a long time and had colored the future of them all
Mrs Wade understood far better than her husband would have supposed that in his own way his married life had been as starved as her own oh far more so for she had her boy
And while it was not at all likely it was not wholly impossible that he might seek a readjustment
It seemed farfetched for her to sit thus and feel that drama was entering their hard lives when nothing had really happened but neverthelessshe knew
As outwardly so calm she speculated with tumbled thoughts on how it might end she tried to analyze why it was that the prospect of a shakeup filled her with such a sense of disaster
Surely it was not because of any reluctance to separate from Martin
Her life would be far easier if they went their own ways
With Bill she could make a home anywhere one that was far more real in a house from which broken promises did not sound as from a trumpet
Ashes of resentment still smouldered against Martin because of that failure of his to play fair
She recalled the years during which she had helped him to earn with never an unexpected pleasure reflected with bitterness that never since they had cast their lives together had he urged her to indulge in any sweet little extravagance though he had denied himself nothing that he really wished
It was no riddle to her as it had been to her niece earlier in the evening why the same hard work had dealt so benignly with Martin and so uncharitably with herself
She comprehended only too well that it was not that alone which had crushed her
It was his ceaseless domination over her the utter subjugation of her will her complete lack of freedom
She glanced across the table at him astounded by his hearty laugh in response to one of Roses sallies
It seemed incredible that it could be really Martins
It had such a ring and came out so easily as if he were more inclined to merriment than to silence
Usually he seemed made of long strips of thin steel but under the inspiration of Roses presence he had become animated brisk interesting
No wonder she was being drawn to him
It was as if he had withheld from his wife a secret alchemy that had kept him handsome and attractive as compelling as when he had come in search of herself so long ago
And now that the last vestige of her own bloom was gone he was laughing at her inwardly as a cunning person does who plays a malicious trick on a simpler more trusting soul
Only it had taken twenty years to spring the point of this one
Hatred welled in her heart a sad weary hatred that knew no tears
She wished that she might hurt him as he had hurt her
Yet with her usual honesty she presently admitted how easy it would be for this malevolence to melt awaya word a look a gesture from Martin and the heart in her would flood with forgiveness but the look did not come the word was unuttered
He was squandering she continued to observe sufficient evidence of his interest at the feet of this child who never would have missed it while she herself who could have lifted mountains from her breast with one tenth of this appreciation was left as she always had been left without the love her being craved the love of a mate rising full and strong to meet her own
It was a yearning that the most cherished of children could never satisfy and as she watched Martin and Rose her position seemed to her to be that of a hungry pauper brought to the table of a rich gourmand there to look on helplessly while the other toyed carelessly with the precious morsels of which she was in such extreme need
And what rankled was that these thoughts were futile that too much water had run under the bridge that it was her lot in Martins life merely to accept what was offered her
She knew that the marks of her many hours of suppressed anguish thousands of days of toil and long series of disappointments were thick upon her
She realized too how ironical it was that with all her work she should have grown to be so ungainly although Martin retained the old magnetism of his gorgeous physique
There was no doubt that if he chose he could still hold a womans devotion
Yes for him there was an open road from this gray monotony if he had the will and the courage to escape
Suddenly she found herself wondering what effect all this would have on Bill
She stole a surreptitious glance at him but he too seemed to have been caught up by Roses gay good humor
Mrs Wade sighed as she remembered how everyone had flocked around Norah
Rose had inherited her mothers charm
Such women were a race apart
They could no more be held responsible for trying to please than a flower for exhaling its fragrance
At what a lovely moment of life she was
Small wonder that Martin was captivated but not even the shadow of harm must fall on that fresh young spirit while she was under their roof
If things went much further she would have it out with him
And this decision reached Mrs Wade felt her usual composure gradually return nor did it again desert her during the long evening through which it seemed to her as if her husband must be some stranger
VII MARTIN BATTLES WITH DUST THE human animal is a strange spectacle to behold let alone comprehend
Not infrequently he goes along for years developing a state of mind a consistent attitude and then having got it thoroughly established does something in distinct contradiction to it
Martin had never cared for music but when one evening a little more than a week after Roses arrival she suggested with a laughing lilt her fondness for it he agreed that he had missed it in his home and to Bills and Mrs Wades unbelieving surprise dwelt at length upon his enjoyment of Fallons band and his longing to blow a cornet
A little later finding an excuse to leave he drove into town on a mission so foreign to his ironclad character that it seemed to cry against his every instinct but which for all that he did with such simplicity as to indicate that it was the most natural step imaginable
He actually bought a twohundreddollar mahogany Victrola and an assortment of records bringing both home with him in his car and assisted eagerly by Bill carrying them into the front room with an air that said it was a purchase he had been intending to make for a long time
Rose rewarded him with her bubbling delight and her aunt noticed with an odd constriction about her heart how Bill revelled at last in the new treasure until now so hopelessly coveted
Martin had never shone to better advantage than this evening as he helped select and put on different pieces lending himself to the mood of each
It was while a footstirring dance was on that Rose asked suddenly Oh Uncle Martin do you know how
He shook his head
Youll have to teach me to square up for learning to drive the car
Thats a bargain and Ill teach Bill too she added with native tact
But Mrs Wade ill at ease in her own parlor caught the afterthought quality of Roses tone
There was no question but that it was for Martin she sparkled sweet and spontaneous as she was
Decidedly the time had come when definite action should not be delayed
It was nearly twelve oclock when they finally broke up and husband and wife found themselves alone in their own room
As they undressed Mrs Wade acted nervously confused as to how to begin while Martin whistled lightly and kept time by a slight bobbing of his head
She shot a meaning look in his direction
You seem happy dont you
He stopped whistling instantly and assumed his more normal look of set sternness
This was the man she knew and she preferred him that way rather than buoyant because of some other woman even though that other was as lovable and innocent of any deliberate mischief as her niece
Not that she was jealous so much as she was hurt
When a woman has fortified herself after years of the existence to which Mrs Wade had submitted with the final conviction that undoubtedly her husbands is a nature that cannot be other than it is and then learns there are emotional potentialities not yet plumbed not to mention a capacity for pleasant comradeship of which he has never vouchsafed her an inkling she finds herself being ground between the millstones of an aching admission of her own deficiencies and a tattered but rebellious pride
Martin when her remark concerning his apparent happiness had registered let his answer be a sober inspection of the garment he had just removed
I dont suppose you can talk to me now after such a strenuous evening she went on more emphatically
And as he maintained his silence she continued with Oh dont think Im blind Martin Wade
I know exactly how far this has gone and I know how far it can go
What are you driving at
You know perfectly well what I meanthe way you are behaving toward Rose
Are you trying to imply that Im carrying on with her
I certainly am
Im not angry Martin
I never was calmer than I am right now and I dont intend to say things just for the sake of saying them
I only want you to know that I have eyes and that I dont want to be made a fool of
To her surprise Martin came over to her and looking at her steadily returned with amazing candidness Im not going to lie to you
Youre perfectly welcome to know whats in my mind
I love her with every beat of my heartshe has brought something new into my life something sacredyouve always thought I cared for nothing but work that all I lived for was to plan and scheme how to make money
Havent you
I dont blame you
Its what Ive always believed but tonight Ive learned something
Mrs Wade could see his blood quicken
She has been in this house only a few days and already I am alive with a new fire
It seems as if these hours are the only ones in which I have ever really livednothing else matters
Nothing
If there could be the slightest chance of my winning her love of making her feel as I am feeling now Id build my world over again even if I had to tear all of the old one down
Martin was now talking to himself oblivious to his wifes presence indifferent to her
Happiness is waiting for me with her with my little flower
Your Rose of Sharon
Her tone was biting
If only I could say that
My Rose of Sharon
It seemed to Mrs Wade that the very room quivered with his low cry that was almost a groan
I know what youre thinking he went on but you know I have never loved you
You knew it when I married you you must have
The twisting agony of itthat he could make capital out of the very crux of all her suffering
I have never deceived you and I never intend to
My life with you hasnt been a Song of Solomon but Im not complaining
Youre not complaining
I hope I wont start complaining Martin
Well now you know how I feel
Ill go on with the present arrangement between us but Im playing square with youits because theres no hope for me
If I thought she cared for me I would go to her right now tonight and pour out my heart to her wife or no wife
Oh Rose have pity
It cant do you any harm if I drink a little joydont spoil her faith in me
Dont frighten her away
I cant bear the thought of her going out into the world to work
Shes like a gentle little doe feeding on liliesshe doesnt dream of the pitfalls ahead of her
And she will never knowshe doesnt even suspect how I feel towards her
She will meet some young fellow in town and marry
Im too old for herbut Rose you dont understand what it means to me to have her in the same house to know that she is sleeping so near so beautiful so ready for love that when I wake up tomorrow she will still be here
Disarmed and partly appeased by the frankness of his confession Mrs Wade sat silently taking in each word studying him with wet eyes her lips almost blue her breath a little short
The fire in his voice the reality of his strange terrible love the eyes that gazed so sadly and so unexpectantly into space the hands that seemed to have shed their weight of toil and clutched too late for the bright flowers of happinessall filled her with compassion
Never had he looked so splendid
He seemed in casting off his thongs to have taken on some of the Herculean quality of his own magnificent gesture
It was as if their barnyard well had burst into a mighty highshooting geyser
To her dying day would she remember that surge of passion
To have met it with anger would have been of as little avail as the stamp of a protesting foot before the tremors of an earthquake
She offered him the comforting directness which she might have given Bill
I didnt know you felt so deeply Martin
Life plays us all tricks its played many with me and its playing one of its meanest with you for whatever happens you are going to sufferfar more than I am
You can believe it or not but Im sorry
Martin felt oddly grateful to her he had not expected this sense of understanding
She might have burst into wild tears
Instead she was pitying him
More possessed of his usual immobility he remarked I must be a fool a great pathetic fool
I look into a girls eyes and immediately see visions
I say a few words to her and she is kind enough to say a few to me and I see pictures of new happiness
I should have more sense
I dont know what is the matter with me
Although countless answers leaped to his wifes tongue she made none but the cryptic Well its no use to discuss it any more tonight
We both need rest
But all the while that she was undressing with her usual sure swift movements and after she had finally slipped between the sheets her mind was racing
She was soon borne so completely out on the current of her own thoughts that she forgot Martins actual presence
She remembered as if it were yesterday the afternoon he came to the office and asked her to marry him
She wondered anew as she had wondered a thousand times if anything other than a wish for a housekeeper had prompted him
She remembered her misgivingshow she had read into him qualities which she had believed all these years were not there
But hadnt her intuition been justified after all by the very man she had seen tonight
Yes her first feeling that he was something finer still in the rough had been correct
She had thought it was his shyness his unaccustomedness to women that had made him such a failure as a loverand all the while it had been simply that she was not the right woman
When love touched him he became a veritable white light
All these years when he had been so cold so hard toward her it simply was because he disliked her
She remembered the day she was hurt and the night her first baby came
Martins brutality even now kindled in her a dull blazing anger and as she realized what depths of feeling were in him his callousness seemed intensified an hundredfold
Well she was having her revenge
All his life he had thwarted her stolen from her used her as one could not use even a hired hand worked her more as a slavedriver hurries his underlings that profits may mount now by her mere existence she was thwarting him
She saw him again as he had flashed before her when he had talked of Rose and she admitted bitterly to herself what in her heart she had known all alongthat if Martin could have loved her she could have worshipped him
Instead he had slowly smothered her but she had at least a dignity in the community
He should not harm that
If they were unhappy at least no one knew it
Her pride was her refuge
If that were violated she felt life would hold no sanctuary that her soul would be stripped naked before the world
But why was she afraid
Didnt Martin have his own position to think of
What if he had said nothing was to be compared to his newfound love for Rose
What stupidity on his part not to realize that it was his very position power and money that commanded her respect
Did he command anything else from her
Mrs Wade reviewed the evening
Yes response had been in Roses laugh in every movement
Hadnt she always adored Martin even as a tiny girl
Hadnt there always been some mystic bond between them
How she had envied them then
But if Martin were to go to her with only his love
From the depths of her observations of people she took comfort
He might stir his lovely Rose of Sharon to the uttermost had he been free he might have won her for his wifebut would it be possible for fiftyfour to hold the attention of twenty for long if he had nothing but his love to offer
Such thoughts were hurrying through her heated mind as Martin slowly laid himself beside her
He said nothing but lost himself in a flood of ceaseless ponderings
After stretching some of the tiredness out of his throbbing muscles he relaxed and lay quietly trying to recall exactly what he had said
Did his wife suspect that there might be no truth in the remark that Rose would never know how he felt toward her
At moments he felt that the girl already divined it again he was not so sure
It was hard to be certain but the more he thought about it the more hope he began to feel that she would yet be wholly his
Her admiration and trust belonged to him now but there might be moral scruples which he would have to overcome
There would be the difficulty of convincing her that she would be doing her aunt no wrong
She would gain courage however from his own heedlessness
That same daring which he had just shown with the older Rose and which had impressed her into silence would eventually move his flower to him
He had thrown down the bars
Secrecy was now out of the question and it was well that he was moving thus in the open
Rose might shrink at first from the plainspokenness of the situation but this phase would soon pass and then the fact that she knew he was not hiding his love for her even from his wife would make it far easier to press his suit and possibly to bring it to a swift consummation
He must win her
He must
He had been mad to admit to himself much less to his Ragweed that there was any doubt of this outcome
It might take a few more days a week not longer than that
But what should he do when Rose gave the message to him
Could he go away with her
This bothered him for a while
Of course he would have to
He could not send his wife away
The community would not tolerate this
Martin knew his neighbors
He did not care a snap for their good opinion but he realized exactly how much they could hurt him if he violated their prejudices beyond a certain point
Fortunately there are millions of communities in the world
This one would rise against him and denounce another would accept them as pleasant strangers
He might be taken for Roses father
He would fight this with tireless care
Yes he would have to go away
But his business interests what about his farm his cattle his machinery his bank stock his mortgages his municipal bonds
How wonderful it would be if he could go with her to the stationhis securities in a grip his other possessions turned into a bank draft
But this woman lying at his sidethe law gave her such a large share
Cataclysmic changes were taking place in the soul of Martin Wade
The very thing which without being able to name he had dreaded a short week ago in the garage was hovering over him casting its foreboding shadow of material destruction
His whole system of values was being upset
He felt an actual revulsion against property
What was it all compared to his Rose
He would throw it at his wifes feethis wifes feet and Bills
Let them take every penny of itno not every penny
He would need a littlejust a thousand or two to start with and then the rest would come easily for he knew how to make money
And how liberal that would be
He could see himself as he would go forth with Rose leaving behind the woman he had never loved and all that he had toiled so many years to amass
It seemed fairthe property for which he had lusted so mercilessly left for the woman with whom he had lived so dully left as the ransom to be paid for his liberty
So he and his Rose of Sharon would walk awaywalk because even the car would be surrenderedand he would be free with the only woman for whom he had ever yearned
Would she be happy for long
His pride answered yes but against his will he pictured himself being dumped ruthlessly into the pitiless sixties while Rose still lingered in the glorious twenties
This was a most unpleasant reflection and Martin preferred to dismiss it
That belonged to tomorrow
He would wait until then to fight tomorrows battles
His mind came back to the property again
Wasnt it rather impetuous to surrender all
Wouldnt it be unfair to Rose to be so generous to his wife
She had Bill
In a few years he would be old enough to run the farm
Until then with his help and good hired hands she could do it herself
Why not leave it and the goods on it to her and take the mortgages and bonds with him
Rose was joy
He could hold her more securely with comforts added to his great love
Her happiness had to be thought of had to be protected
He could tell that his wife was still awake
He might begin to talk and maybe they could arrange a settlement
But he was getting too tired for a discussion that might invite tears and even a fit of hysterics like the one she had gone through before their first child came dead
He could see her still as she looked that morning in the barn crying Youll be punished for this some dayyou willyou will
You dont love me but some time you will love some one
Then youll understand what it is to be treated like this It gave him the creeps now to remember it
It was like one of those old incantations almost like a curse
What if some day his Rose should grow to be as indifferent feel as little tenderness toward him as he had felt toward his wife at that moment
The pain of it made him break out into a fine sweat
But he hadnt understood
What had he understood until this love had come into his life
He would never do a thing as cruel as that now
Come to think of it the older Rose wasnt acting like a bad sort
But then when it came to a showdown she might not be so magnanimous as she had appeared tonight
Mrs Wade was still thinking
She also was measuring possibilities and clairvoyantly sensing what was going on in her husbands mind
She too was sure that Rose would capitulate to him
She felt a deep sympathy for the girl
Martin had said it himselfhe was too old for her
Her happiness lay with youth
And yet how could one be so certain
Love was so illusive so capricious
Did it really bow to the accident of years
Had she Rose Wade the right to snatch from anyones hands the most precious gift of life
Wouldnt she have sold her very soul at one time to have had Martin care for her like this
Oh if the child were wise she would not hesitate
She would drink her cup of joy while it was held out to her brimming full
A strange conclusion for a staid churchwoman like Mrs Wade but her rich humanity transcended all her training
She wondered if there could be anything in the belief that there was waiting somewhere for each soul just one other
There were people she knew who thought that
Rose had drawn out all that was finest in Martinshe had transformed him into a lover and if she wanted the man himself she could have him
But decided his wife he could not take with him the things which her sweat and blood had helped to create
She would give him a divorce but her terms would be as brutal as the Martin with whom she had lived these twenty years and who now took it for granted that she would let him do whatever he chose
She was to be made to step aside was she with no weapon with which to strike back and no armor with which to protect herself
Well there was one way she might hit him one
She would strike him in his weakest point his belongings
Yes Martin Wade might leave her but all his property must be left behindevery cent of it
There should be a contract to that effect otherwise she would fight as only a frenzied woman can fight
The two of them lying there side by side as quietly as if in death each considered the issue settled
She would let him go without his property Martin would leave with half of it
And through all the long wordless controversy their little Rose of Sharon a few yards away slept as only a tired child can sleep
VIII THE DUST SMOTHERS WHEN Martin opened his eyes next morning he realized with a start that he had overslept which was a new experience for one whose life had been devoted so consistently to hard toil and he saw with a sharper start that his wife who always got up about a half hour earlier than himself was not even yet awake
He wondered what had come over him that he should have committed such a sin and as his tired mind opened one of its doors and let the confused impressions flutter out he countenanced a luxury as unusual as the impulse that had sent him townward the evening before to bring home the Victrola
Instead of jumping out hastily so that he might attend to his hungry bellowing stock he lay quietly marshalling the new incidents of his life into a parade which he ordered to march across the low ceiling
He could not comprehend what the tornado had been about
There had been so little on which to base the excitementso little that he was puzzled as to what had caused the scene with his wife
And as he reflected it seemed highly unlikely to him that he would ever permit himself to do anything that might jeopardize his whole life topple over the structure that decades of work had built
Why it was scarcely less than suicidal to let a stranger come into his heart and maybe weaken his position
He remembered his last thought before falling asleep
It appeared unutterably rash though when hit upon it had been a decision that moderated a more extreme action
Now he realized that it was the very acme of foolishness deliberately to sacrifice half his fortune especially the farm itself to which he had given so many years of complete concentration
Certainly if Rose were ready to be his he might not hesitate even a second but this flower was still to be won by him and this morning aware of what scant grounds he had upon which to venture any forecasts he felt as full of doubt as he had been of confidence last night
It had been a saddening experience but fortunate for all that inasmuch as nothing serious had come of it except that he was greatly sobered
Martin could not understand that mysterious something which had risen up in his nature and threatened to wreck a carefullybuilt life
It was his first meeting with the little demon that rebels in a man after he thinks his character and his reactions thoroughly established and he shuddered as he realized how close the strange imp had pulled him to the precipice
Yesterday that precipice had seemed a new paradise now it was a yawning chasm and he drew back frightened
Cows horses sheep pigs chickens turkeys dogs barn catsall do not remain patient while the man who owns them lies in bed dreaming dreams
They wait a while and then get nervous
The many messages for food which they sent to Martin forced him to spring out of bed and hurry to them for nothing is as unbearably insistent as a barn and yard full of living things clamoring their determination to have something to eat
As Martin ran to stop the bedlam he saw the world as an enormous empty stomach at the opening of which he stood hurling in the feed as fast as his muscles would permit
It was all there was to farmingraising crops and then shovelling the hay and the grain into these stomachs
Martin stood back a few feet and with loving eyes watched his animals enjoy their food
Here were the creatures he loved
The fine herd of Holstein cowstheir big eyes looked at him with such trust
And their black and white markingsso spick and span with shininess because he threw salt on them that each cow might lick the other cleantheir heavy milk veins great udders and backs as straight as a dieall appealed to his sense of the beautiful
God Almighty
he thought but theyre wonders
Theres none like them west of Chicago
The mule colts so huge and handsome and oh so knowing
made him chuckle his pride and satisfaction in a muttered Mans creation are you you fine young devils
Well youre a credit the lot of you to whoever deserves it
His eyes wandered over the rest of his stock swept his wide realm
It was all a very part of himself
Yes here was his lifehere was his world
It would be the height of folly to leave it
At breakfast his wife ate sullenly refusing to be drawn into the conversation but by a wise compression of her lips and a flicker of amusement in her eyes which seemed to say Oh if only you could see how absurd you appear she contrived very cleverly to render Martin miserably selfconscious
Hampered by this new and unexpected feeling his attempts to be pleasant fell flat and he lapsed into his old grimness while Rose eating quickly confined her remarks to her determination to go to town in search of a job
Had Martin not talked as he had to his wife he would have been able undoubtedly to disregard her and to continue the line of chatter which he had hit upon so happily and which he had never suspected was in him
But the fact not so much that she knew but that from this vantage point of knowledge she was ridiculing him was too much for even his selfpossession
It made the light banter impossible
Especially as there was no doubt that Rose did not seem anxious for it
For Martin had not been the only member of that household who had held early communion with himself
The girl had sat long and dreamily at her dressing tablethe dainty one of rich dark mahogany that Uncle Martins thoughtfulness had provided
It seemed unbelievable but there was no use pretending she was mistakenUncle Martin Aunt Roses husband was falling in love with her
She felt a little heady with the excitement of it
He was so different from the callow youths and dapper fellows who had heretofore worshipped at her shrine
There was something so imposing so important about him
She was conscious that a man so much older might not appeal to many girls of her age but it so happened that he did appeal to her
She would be able to have everything she wished toodidnt she know how good how kind how tender he could be
And her heart yearned toward himhe was so clearly misunderstood unhappy
But what about Aunt Rose
Well then why had she let herself get to be so ugly
She looked as if the greases of her own kitchen stove had cooked into her skin thought the girl mercilessly
Didnt she know there was such a thing as a powder puff
Women like that brought their own troubles upon themselves thats what they did
And she was an old prude too
Anyone could see with half an eye that she didnt like the idea of Uncle Martin learning to dancewhy she didnt even like his getting the Victrolawhen it was just what both he and Bill had been wanting
But for all that she was her aunt her own mothers sister and poor dear she was a good soul
It would probably upset her awfully and besides oh well it just wasnt right
Before her mirror Rose blushed furiously quite ashamed of the light way in which she had been leading Uncle Martin on
But I havent said one solitary thing auntie couldnt have heard she justified herself
Oh well no harm had been done
But she mustnt stay here that was certain
She wouldnt say so or hurt their feelings for she wanted to be on the best of terms with them always but she would stop flirting with Uncle Martin and just turn him back into a dear good friend
She hoped she was clever enough to do that much
And the darkbrown curls received a brushing that left no doubt of the vigor of her decisions
She insisted that she go to Fallon that morning
Ive been here eight whole days Uncle Martin she announced firmly eight whole days and havent tried to get a thing
Its terrible isnt it Aunt Rose how lazy I am
Im going to have Bill take me in right straight after breakfast
If youre so set on it Ill see about your position this afternoon conceded Martin reluctantly
Well drive in in the car
Oh Uncle Martin she coaxed innocently let me try my luck alone first
Bill can tell me who the different men are and if I know hes waiting for me outside in the buggy it will keep me from being scared
And her young cousin only too pleased with the proposed arrangement chimed in with Thats the stuff Rose
Folks have got to go it on their own to get anywhere
By evening she had a position in an insurance agents office with wages upon which she could live with fair decency
As it had rained all day and her employer wanted her to begin the next morning she had the best possible excuse for renting a room in Fallon and asking Bill to ride in horseback with some things which she would ask Aunt Rose over the telephone to pack
It rained all the next day too and Sunday when she met Mrs Wade and Bill at church she told them she had some extra typing she had promised to do by Monday
No auntie this week it is really and truly just impossible but next weekhonest and true
she insisted as the older woman seconded rather impersonally her sons urgent invitation to chicken and noodles
Soon winter was upon them in good earnest and Roses visits home as she always called it were naturally infrequent
By Christmas time she was receiving attentions from Frank Mall Nellies second son a young farmer of twentyfive
To Mrs Wades everlasting credit she never twitted Martin with this although she knew it from Roses own lips a month before he heard of it through Bill
She was too grateful for their narrow escape to feel vindictive and might have convinced herself they had merely endured a bad nightmare if it had not been for the shiny Victrola the sight of it underscored the whole experience and she wished there were some way to get rid of the thing a wish that was echoed even more fervently by Martin
In the evenings they would sit around the cleared supper table she doing odd jobs of mending Martin reading checking up the interest dates on his mortgages or making entries in his account book while Bill at his books would study to the accompaniment of record after record blissfully unconscious of what a thorn in the flesh he and his music were to both his parents
It was all so unpleasant
To Mrs Wade it brought up pictures
And it made Martin feel sheepishthe way he had felt that afternoon decades ago as he sat in the bakery eating a chocolate icecream soda and watching her walk across the Square
He would have told Bill to quit playing itmore than once the sharp words were on his tonguebut memories of the enthusiasm he had evinced the night he brought it home kept him silent
He was afraid of what the boy might say afraid he might put two and two together so he let it stay although with his usual caution he had arranged for a trial and would have felt justified in packing it back as soon as the roads had permitted
Illogically he felt it was all Bills fault that he must endure this annoyance
That fall the boy started to high school in Fallon making the long daily ride to and from town on horseback
He was a good pupil and the hours he spent with his lessons were precious they made the farm drift away
To his mind which was opening like a bud it seemed that history was the recorded romance of men who were everything but farmers
School books told fascinating stories of conquerors soldiers inventors writers engineers kings statesmen and orators
He would sit and dream of the doers of great deeds
When he read of Alexander the Great Bill was he
He was Caesar and Napoleon Washington and Lincoln Grant and Edison and Shakespeare
When railroads were built in the pages of his American History it was Bill himself no less who was the presiding genius
His imagination constructed and levelled and rebuilt and remade
One beautiful November afternoon in his Junior year at the sound of the last bell which usually found him cantering out of town he went instead to the school readingroom and sitting down calmly opened his book and slowly read
The clock ticked off the seconds he was stealing from his father counted the minutes that had never belonged to Bill before but which now tasted like old wine on the palate
He cuddled down lost to the world until five oclock when the building was closed
He left it only to march down a few blocks to the towns meager library where another hour flew past
Gradually an empty feeling in his middle region became increasingly insistent and briefly exploring his pockets Bill decided upon a restaurant where he bought a stew and rolls for fifteen cents
Never had a supper tasted so satisfying
After it he strolled around the town feeling a pleasant warmth in his veins a springiness to his legs a new song in his heart
It was so good to be free to go where he pleased to be his own master if only for a stolen hour to keep out of sight of a cow or a plow
He wondered why he had never done this before
It was youth daring Fate without show or bravado or fear rolling the honey under his tongue and drawing in its sweetness youth that lives for the moment that can be blind to the threatening future that can forget the mean past youth slipping along with some chewinggum between his teeth and a warm sensation in his stewcrammed stomach whistling dreaming happy youth that can without premeditation remain away from home and leave udders untapped and pigs unfed sublime enigma angering bit of irresponsibility to the Martins of a fiercely practical world
Bill was that rare kind of boy who could pull away from the traces just when he seemed most thoroughly broken to the harness
It was ten oclock before he got his pony out of the livery barn and started for home
Even on the way he refused to imagine what would happen
He entered the house quietly as though to tell his father that it was his next move and setting his bundle of books on a chair he glanced at his mother
She was at the stove where an armful of kindling had been set off to take the chill out of the house
She looked at him mysteriously as though he were a ghost of some lost one who had strayed in from a graveyard but she said nothing
Bill did not even nod to her
He fumbled with his books as though to keep them from slipping to the floor when quite obviously they were not even inclined to leave the chair
Rose let her eyes fall and then slide under halfclosed lids until they had Martin in her view
She looked at him appealingly but he was staring at a paper which he was not reading
He had been in this chair for two hours without a word pretending to be studying printed words which his mind refused to register
Martin had done Bills share of the chores with unbelief in his heart
He had never imagined such a thing
Who would have thought it could happena son of his
His wife broke the silence with What happened Billy
Were you sick
No mother I wasnt sick
Martin was still looking at his paper which his fists gripped tightly
Then you just couldnt get home sooner could you
Something you couldnt help kept you away didnt it
Bill shook his head slowly
No he answered easily
I could have come home much sooner
Billy dear what DID happen
She was beginning to feel panicky he was courting distress
Nothing mother
I just felt like staying in the readingroom and reading Oh you HAD to do some lessons didnt you
Miss Roberts should have known better I didnt have to stay inI wanted to
Martin still kept silent his eyes looking over the newspaper wide open staring the muscles of his jaw relaxed
The boy was quick to sense that he was winningthe simple nonresistance of the lamb was confounding his father
I wanted to stay
I read a book and then I took a walk and then I dropped in at the restaurant for a bite and then I walked around some more and then I went to a movie
Billy what are you saying
Martin slowly putting down his paper remarked without stressing a syllable You had better go to bed Bill at once without arguing
Bill moved towards the parlor as though to obey
At the door he stopped a moment and said I wasnt arguing I was just answering mother
She wanted to know
She does not want to know
Then I wanted her to know that I dont intend to work after school any more
Ill do my chores in the morning but thats all
From now on nobody can MAKE me do anything
I am not asking you to do anything but go to bed
I dont intend to come home tomorrow afternoon until Im ready
Or any afternoon
And if you dont like it Billy
his mother cried Billy
go to bed
The boy obeyed
Bill was fifteen when this took place
The impossible had happened
He had challenged the master and had won
Even after he had turned in his father remained silent feeling a secret respect for him mysteriously he had grown suddenly to manhood
Martin was too mental to let anger express itself in violence and besides strangely enough he felt no desire to punish there was still the dislike he had always felt for himhis son who was the son of this woman but though he would never have confessed aloud the satisfaction it gave him he began to see there was in the boy more than a little of himself
Poor Billy his mother apologized hes tired
He didnt say he was tired Then he did say he was tired of working evenings
Thats different
Yes its different Martin but can you make him work
No I dont intend to try
He isnt my slave
With overwhelming pride in her eyes pride that shook her voice she exclaimed Not anybodys slave and not afraid to declare it
Billy is a different kind of a boy
He doesnt like the farmhe hates it I know
He loathes everything about it
Only the other day he told me he wished he could take it and tear it board from board and leave it just a piece of bleak prairie as it was when your father brought you here Martin
You actually mean he said he would tear down what took so many years of work to build
This farm that gives him a home and clothes and feeds him
He did Martin
And he meant itthere was hatred burning in his eyes
Theres that in his heart which can tear and rend and theres that which can build
Oh my unhappy Billy my boy
Dont get hysterical
What do you want me to do
Have I said he must work
No but you have tried to rub it into his soul and it just cant be done
Youre not to be blamed for being what you are nor is BillyIll milk his cows
Im not asking that
But I will Martin
And let him stand by and watch you
Put it that way if you will
Billy must get away from here
I see that now
I havent suggested it
But I do
I want him to be happy
Well let him board in Fallon the rest of the year
The butter and egg money will be enough to carry him through
It wont cost much
If we dont send him hell run away
I know him
Hes my boy and your son Martin
I wont see him suffer in a strange world learning his lessons from bitter experiences
I want him to be taken care of
Very well have it as you say
Im not putting anything in the way
I thought this was his home but I see it isnt
It isnt a prison
He can go and good luck go with him
And after a long silence He would tear down this farmthe best in the county
Tear it downboard from board
IX MARTINS SON SHAKES OFF THE DUST THE very next day Mrs Wade rented a room for Bill in the same home in which Rose boarded and for the rest of the winter she and Martin went on as beforeworking as hard as ever and making money even faster while peace settled over their household a peace so profound that in her more intuitive moments Bills mother felt in it an ominous quality
The storm broke with the summer vacation and the boys pointblank refusal to return to farm work
His father laid down an ultimatum until he came home he should not have a cent even from his mother and home he should not come at all until he was willing to carry his share of the farm work willingly and without further argument
You see he pointed out to his wife thats the thanks I get for managing along without him this winter
The ungrateful young rascal
If he doesnt come to his senses shortly Oh Martin dont do anything rash implored Mrs Wade
Nearly all boys go through this period
Just be patient with him
But even she was shaken when his Aunt Nellie over ostensibly for an afternoon of sociable carpetrag sewing began abruptly Do you know what Bill is doing Rose
Working in the mines returned his mother easily
Isnt it strange Nellie that he should be digging coal right under this farm the very coal that gave Martin his start
Well Im not going to beat about the bush continued her sisterinlaw abruptly
Hes working in the mines all right but he isnt digging coal at all though that would be bad enough
I wouldnt say a word about it but I think you ought to know the truth and put a stop to such a risky businesshes firing shots
Roses heart jumped but she continued to wind up her large ball with the same uninterrupted motion
Are you sure
I made Frank find out for certain
Its an extra dangerous mine because gas forms in it unusually often and he gets fifteen dollars a day for the one hour he works
Theres a contract but hes told them hes twentyone and when you prove hes under age theyll make him stop
Rose still wound and wound her clear eyes looking over her glasses fixed on Nellie
Its bad enough Ill say rapped out the spare angular woman to have everybody talking about the way Martin has ditched his son without having the boy scattered to bits or burned to a cinder
Already hes been blown twenty feet by one windy shot and more than once hes had to lie flat while those horrible gases burned themselves out right over his head
His buddie the Italian who fires in the other part of the mine at the same time told Harry Brown the nightman and he told Frank himself
Why they say if hed have moved the least bit it would have fanned the fire downward and hed have been in a fine mess
Sooner or later all shotfirers meet a tragic end
You want to put your foot down Rose and put it down hardfor once in your life if you can she added half under her breath
It isnt altogether Martins fault began Rose but Nellie cut her off with a short Now dont you tell me a word about that precious brother of mine
Its as plain to me as the nose on your face that between his bullheaded hardness and your wishywashy softness youre fixing to ruin one of the best boys God ever put on this earth
Ill talk to Billy Rose promised
It was the first time she ever had found herself definitely in opposition to her boy but she felt serene in the confidence of her own power to dissuade him from anything so perilous
She understood the general routine of mining and had been daily picturing him going down in the cage to the bottom travelling through a long entry until he was under his home farm and located in one of the low threefoot rooms where a Kansas miner must stoop all day
Oh how it had hurtthat thought of those fine young shoulders bending bending
She had visualized him filling his car and mentally had followed his coal as it was carried up to the surface to be dumped into the hopper weighed and dropped down the chute into the flat cars
Of course there was always the danger of a loosened rock falling on him but wasnt there always the possibility of accidents on a farm too
Didnt the companys man always go down first into the mine to test the air and make certain it was all right
Rose had convinced herself that the risk was not so great after all though she could not help sharing a little of her husbands wonder that the boy could prefer to work underground instead of in the sweet fresh sunshine
But she had thought it was because in the desperation of his complete revolt from Martins domination anything else seemed to him preferable
Now in a lightning flash she understood
This reaction from a life whose duties had begun before sunup and ended long after sundown made danger seem as nothing in comparison with the marvellous chance to earn a comfortable living with only one hours work a day
Her conversation with Bill proved that she had been only too right
The boy was intoxicated with his own liberty
I know I ought to have told you mother he confessed
I wanted to
Honest I did but I was afraid youd worry though you neednt
The man who taught me how to fire has been doing it over twenty years
A lot of its up to a fellow himself
You can pretty near tell if the air is all right by the way it blowsthe less the better it is
And if youre right careful to see that the toolboxes the boys leave are all lockedsos no powder can catch you knowand always start lighting against the air so that if theres gas and it catches the firell blow away from you instead of following you upand if you examine the fuses to see theyre long enough and the powder is tamped in just righteach miner does that before he leaves and lots of firers just give em a hasty onceover instead of a real lookand then shake your heels good and fast after you do fire Billy
Rose was white
I cant bear itto hear you go on so lightly when its your life your LIFE youre playing with
For my sake son give it up
With an odd sinking of the heart she observed the expression in his face which she had seen so often in his fathersthe one that said as plainly as words that nothing could shake his determination
A fellows got a right to some good times in this world he said very low and Im getting mine now
Im not going to grind away and grind away all my life like father and youve done
If anything did happen Id have had a chance to dream and think and read instead of getting to be old without ever having any fun out of it all
Maybe you wont believe it but some days for hours I just lie in the sun like a darky boy not even thinking
Gee
it feels great
And sometimes I read all day until I have to go to the mine
Theres one thing Im going to tell you square he went on a firm ring in his voice boyish for all its deep bass note Im never going back to the farm never
Mother he cried suddenly coming over to take her hand in both his
Will you leave father
We could rent a little house and youd have hardly anything to do
Im making more than lots of men with families
And Id give you my envelope without opening it every payday
Oh Billy you dont know what youre saying
I couldnt leave your father
I couldnt think of it
What I dont see is how you can stand it to stay with him
Hes always been a brute to you
Hes never cared a red cent for either of us
Rose was abashed before the harsh logic of youth
Oh son she murmured brokenly there are things one cant explain
I suppose it may seem strange to youbut his life has been so empty
He has missed so much
Everything Billy
Then its his own fault judged the boy
If ever anybodys always had his own way and done just as he darn pleased its father
I wish hed die thats what I wish
Bill
His mothers tone was stern
There you are
he marvelled
You must have wished it lots of times yourself
I know you have
Yet you always talk as if you loved him
In Roses eyes the habitual look of patience and understanding deepened
How could Bill as yet scarcely tried by life comprehend the purging flames through which she had passed or realize times power to reveal unsuspected truths
When youve been married to a man nearly twentytwo years and have built up a place together theres bound to be a bond between you she eluded
He just lives for this farm
Its almost as dear to him as you are to me son and its a wonderful heritage Bill a magnificent heritage
Just think
Two generations have labored to build it out of the dust
Your fathers whole life is in it
Your fathers and mine
And your grandmothers
If only you could ever come to care for it
Bill fidgeted uneasily
You mean you want me to go on with it
he demanded
You want me to come back to it settle down to be a farmerlike father
The tone in which he asked this question made Rose choose her words carefully
What are your plans son
What do you want to benot just now but finally
I cant see what difference it makes what a fellow isexcept that in one business a man makes more than in another
And I cant see either that it does a person a bit of good to have money
Im having more fun right now than father or you ever hadmore fun than anybody I know
Mother and his face was solemn as if with a great discovery Ive figured it out that its silly to do as most peoplejust live to work
Im going to work just enough to live comfortably
Not one scrap more either
You cant think how I hate the very thought of it
Rose sighed
Couldnt she indeed
She understood only too well how deeply this rebellion was rooted
The hours when he had been dragged up from the far shores of a dreamful slumber to shiver forth in the chill darkness to milk and chore still rankled
Those tangy frosty afternoons when he had been forced to clean barns and plow while the other boys went rabbit and possum hunting or nutting were afternoons whose loss he still mourned
Nothing had yet atoned for the evenings when he had been torn from his reading and sent sternly to bed because he must get up so early
Always work had stolen from him these treasuresdreams recreation and knowledge
He had been obliged to fight the farm and his father for even a modicum of themthe things that made life worth living
And the irony of itthat eventually it would be this farm and Martins driving methods which if he became reconciled to his father would make it possible for him to drink all the fullness of leisure
It was too tragic that the very thing which should have stood for opportunity to the boy had been used to embitter him and drive him into danger
But he must not lose his birthright
An almost passionate desire welled in Roses heart to hold on to it for him
True she too had been a slave to the farm
Yet not so much a slave to it she distinguished as to Martins absorption in its development
And of late years there had been for her running through all the humdrum days a satisfaction in perfecting it
In her mind now floated clearly the ideal toward which her husband was striving
She had not guessed how much it had become her own until she felt herself being drawn relentlessly by Bills quiet but implacable determination to have her leave it all behind
If only he would try again she felt sure all would be so different
His father had learned a lesson of that she was positive and though he would not promise it would not be so hard on the boy
And with this new independence of Bills to strengthen her they could resist Martin more successfully as different issues came up
She could manage to help her boy get what he wanted out of life without his having to pay such a terrible price as the mine on one hand and his fathers displeasure on the other might exact for she knew that if he persisted too long the break with Martin could never be bridged and that in the end his father would evoke the full powers of the law to disinherit him and tie her own hands as completely as possible in that direction
But she was far too wise to press such arguments in her sons present mood
They would have to drift for a while she saw that clearly until she could gradually impress upon him how different farming would be if he were his own master
In time he might even come to understand how much Martin needed her
Say you will Bill pleading insistent broke in on her train of reflections Ive always dreamed of this day when wed go away and now its come
I can take care of you
As he stood there a glorious figure in his youthful selfconfidence a turn of his head reminded her a second time of Martin recalling sharply the way her husband had looked the night he told her of his love for the other Rose
He had been bothered by no fine qualms about abandoning herself
She thought of his final surrender of love to wisdom
It was only youth that dared pursue happinessto purchase delicious idleness by gambling with death
Billy was her boy
His dreams and hopes should be hers her way of life the one that gave him the most joy
She would follow him if need be to the end of the earth
Very well son she said simply her voice breaking over the few words
If a year from now you still feel like this Ill do as you wish
You dont know how I hate him muttered the boy
Its only when Im tramping in the woods or in the middle of some book I like that I can forgive him for living
No mother I dont mean all that he laughed giving her a bearlike hug
It was in this more reasonable side this ability to change his point of view quickly when he became convinced he was wrong that Mrs Wade now put her faith
She would give him plenty of rope she decided not try to drive him
It would all come right if she only waited and she prayed nightly with an increasing tranquillity that he might be kept safe from harm taking deep comfort in the new light of contentment that was gradually stealing into his face
After all each one had to work out his destiny in his own way she supposed
It was less than a month later that her telephone rang and Rose calmly laying aside her sewing and getting up rather stiffly because of her rheumatism answered thinking it probably a call from Martin who had left earlier in the evening to wind up a little matter of a chattel on some growing wheat
It had just begun to rain and she feared he might be stuck in the road somewhere calling to tell her to come for him
But it was not Martins voice that answered
Mrs
Wade
Yes
Whythere was a forbidding break that made her shudder
A second later she convinced herself that it seemed a natural haltpeople do such things without any apparent cause but she could not help shaking a little
Is it about Mr
Wade
and as she asked this question she wondered why she had spoken her husbands name when it was Bills that really had rushed through her mind
No maam it aint about Martin Wade Im callin you up it aint him at all I see
She said this calmly and quietly as though to impress her informant and reassure him
What is it
It was almost unnecessary to ask for she knew already what had happened knew that the boy had flung his dice and lost
Its your son Mrs Wade its him Im acallin about
Were about to bring him home to youanand I thought itd be better to call you up first sos you might expect us an not take on with the suddenness of it all
This is BrownHarry Brownthe nightman at the mine down here
Weve got the ambulance here and were about ready to start
There was an evenness about the strange voice that she understood better than its words
If Bill had been hurt the man would have been quick and jerky in his speaking as though he were feeling the boys pain with him but he was so even about it allas even as Death
Then Ill phone for Dr Bradley so hell be here by the time you come said Rose wondering how she could think of so practical a thing
Her mind had wrapped itself in a protecting armor forbidding the shock of it all to strike with a single blow
She couldnt understand why she was not screaming
You canif you want to but Bill dont need him Mrs Wadehes dead
Slowly she hung up the receiver the wall still around her brain holding it tight and keeping her nerves taut afraid to release them for fear they might snap
She stood there looking at the receiver as her hands came together
As though she were talking to a person instead of the telephone before her she gasped Soso THIS is what it has all been forthis
Into the world into Martins worldand this way out of it
Burned to deathBilly
The rain had lessened a little and now the wind began to shake the house rattle the windows and scream as it tore its way over the plains
The sky flared white and the world lighted up suddenly as though the sun had been turned on from an electric switch
At the same instant she saw a bolt of lightning strike a young tree by the roadside heard the sharp click as it hit and then watched the flash dance about now on the road now along the barbed wire fencing
Then the world went black again
And a rumble quickly grew to an earthshaking blast of thunder
It was as though that tree were Billy struck by a gush of flying fire
The next bolt broke above the house and the light it threw showed her the stripling split and lying on the ground
In the impenetrable darkness she realized that the house fuse of their Delco system must have been blown out and she groped blindly for a match
She could hear the rain coming down again now in rivers
There was unchained wrath in the downpour viciousness
It was a madman rushing in to rend and tear
It frothed and writhed and spat hatred
Rose shook as though gripped by a strong hand
She was afraidof the rain the lightning the thunder the darkness alone there waiting for them to bring her Billy
She was too terrified to add her weeping to the wail of the windit would have been too ghastly
Would she never find a match
As she lit the lamp like the stab of a needle in the midst of agony came the thought of how long it had been after Martin had put in his electrical system and connected up his barns before she had been permitted to have this convenience in the house
What would he think now
She wished he were home
Anyone would be better than this awful waiting alone
She could only stand there away from the window looking out at the sheets of water running down the panes and shivering with the frightfulness and savageness of it all
Her ears caught a rumble fainter than thunder and the splash of horses hoofsits too muddy for the motor ambulance she thought mechanically
Theyre using the old one and her heart contracting twisting a queer dryness in her throat she opened the door as they stopped her hand shading the lamp against the sudden inrush of wind and rain
In there through the parlor she said dully indicating the new room and thinking bitterly as she followed them that now when it could mean nothing to Billy Martin would offer no objections to its being given over to him
The scuffling of feet the low matteroffact orders of a directing voice Easy now boysall together lift
Watch out pull that sheet back up over him and a brawny workstooped man saying to her awkwardly I wouldnt look at him if I was you Mrs Wade till the undertaker fixes him up and she was once more alone
As if transfixed she continued to stand looking beyond the lamp beyond the bed on which her sons large figure was outlined by the sheet beyond the front door which faced her beyondinto the night looking for Martin waiting for him to come home to his boy
She asked herself again and again how she had been so restrained when her Billy had been carried in
After what seemed interminable ages she heard heavy steps on the back porch and knew that her husband had returned at last
He brought in with him a gust of wind that caused the lamp to smoke
She held it with both hands afraid that she might drop it and carrying it to the diningroom table set it down slowly looking at him
He seemed huger than ever with his hulk sinking into the gray darkness behind him
There was something elephantine about him as he stood there soaked to the skin bending forward a little breathing slowly and deeply his fine nostrils distending with perfect regularity his face in the dim light yellow with the large lines almost black
He was hatless and his tawnygray hair was flat with wetness coming down almost to his eyes so clear and farseeing
Whats the matter with the lights
Fuse blown out
he asked spitting imaginary rain out of his mouth
Rose did not answer
Awful night for visiting Martin announced roughly as he took off his coat
But it was lucky I went or all would have been pretty bad for me
Do you know that rascal was delivering the wheat to the elevatorwheat on which I held a chatteland I got to Tom Mayer just as he was figuring up the weights
You should have seen Johnsons face when I came in
He knew I had him cornered
Here I said whats up
And that lying rascal turned as white as death and said something about getting ready to bring me a check
I told him I was much obliged but I would take it along with me and I did
Here it isfourteen hundred dollars plus interest
And I got it by the skin of my teeth
I didnt stop to argue with him for I saw the storm coming on
I went racing but a half mile north I skidded into the ditch
I really feel like leaving the car there all night but it would do a lot of damage
Ill have to get a team and drag it in
I call it a good days work
What do you say
He looked at her closely for the first time noticing her drawn face and faraway look
Whats the matter
You look goopy Rose settled herself heavily in the rocker close to the table
Youre not sick are you
She shook her head a few times and answered Hes in there Who
Martin straightened up ready for anything
Billy Oh
A light flashed into Martins face
So he has come back has he
Back home
What made him change toward this place
Is he here to stay
No Martin Then if he hasnt come to his senses what is he doing herehere in my house the home he hates He doesnt hate it now Rose replied struggling for words that she might express herself and end this cruel conversation but all she could do was to point nervously toward the spare room
What is he doing in there
Its the one spot that Rose can call her own poor child
Hes on the bed Martin Whats the matter with the davenport hes always slept on
Is he sick
What in heavens name is going on in this house
As Martin started toward the bedroom his wife opened her lips to tell him the truth but the words refused to come at the same instant it struck her that not to speak was brutal yet just
She would let Martin go to this bed with words of anger on his lips with feelings of unkindness in his heart
She would do this
Savage
Yes but why not
There seemed to be something fair about it
Then her heartstrings pulled more strongly than ever
No it was too hard
She must stop him tell him prepare him
But before the words came he was out of the room and when she spoke he did not hear her because of the rain
He saw the vague lines of the boys body hidden by the sheet and thought quickly Bills old ostrichlike trick and while at the same instant something told him that a terrible thing had happened the idea did not register completely until he had his hand on the linen
Then with a short yank he pulled away the cover and saw the boys head
Dark as it was it was enough to show him the truth
With a quick move he covered him again
There was a smeary wetness on his fingers which he wiped away on the side of his trousers
They were drenched with rain but he distinguished the sticky feel of blood leaving his hand as he rubbed it nervously
His first emotion was one of anger with Rose
He was sure she had played this sinister jest deliberately to torture him and he had fallen into the trap
He wanted to rush back into the other room and strike her down
He would show her
But he dismissed this impulse for he did not want her to see him like this no hold on himself and his mind without direction
Sitting there she would have the advantage
Without so much as a sound except for the slight noise he made in walking Martin went through the parlor towards the front door and out to the steps where he leaned for a moment against the weatherboarding letting the rain fall on him as he stared dully down at the ground
It felt good to stand there
No eyes were on him and the rain was refreshing
This had been too much for him
Never had he known himself to be so near to bewilderment
How fortunate that he had escaped by this simple trick of leaving the house
Then he thought of the cara halfmile northand the horses in the stable
He must do something
He would bring the car into the garage
It was relieving to hurry across the dripping grass toward the barn
How wonderful it was to keep the body doing something when the breath in him was short his heart battering like an engine with burnedout bearings his brain in insane chaos
As he applied a match to the lantern he thought of his wife again and his face regained its scowl
Only when he had his great heavy team in the yard his lantern hanging from his arm the reins in his hands and was pulling back with all his strength as he followed the horsesonly then did he permit himself to think about the tragedy that had befallen
Hes deadkilled he groaned
It had to come
Shotfirers dont last long
Whoa there Lottie not so fast Jet whoa
His protesting team in control again he trudged heavily behind
Its terrible to die that waynot a chance in a thousand
And a kid of sixteen didnt have the judgment couldnt have
But Bill knew what he was facing every evening
He didnt go in blindly
Theyll blame me as though it was my fault
I didnt want him to go there
I wanted him to take a hand here to run the place by himself in good time
It was his mother who sent him away first
He went on like that justifying himself more positively as excuse after excuse suggested itself
Not until he had convinced himself that he was in no way responsible did he allow his heart to beat a little for this boy of his
Poor Bill he thought on it has been a tough game for him
Lost in the shuffle
Born into something he didnt like and trying to escape only to get caught
What did he expect out of life anyway
Why didnt he learn that its only a lot of senseless pain
Every moment of it painfrom coming into the world to going out
Oh Bill why didnt you learn what I know
You had brains boy but it would have been better if you had never used them
Ive brains too but Ive always managed to keep them tied downbuckled to the farm to investments and workthinking about things that make us forget life
Its all dust and dust with rain once in a while only the rain steams off and its dust again
Martin began to review the course of his own past and smiled bitterly
Others were able to live the same kind of an existence but unlike himself took it as a preparation for another day another existence which it seemed to him was measured and cut to order by professionals who understood how to fix up the meaning of life so that it would soothe and satisfy
He thought how much better it was to be a dumb unquestioning beast or a human being conscious of his soul than to be as he wasalone a materialist who saw the meaninglessness of matter and whose mind in some manner which he did not understand had developed a slant that made him doubt what others accepted so easily as facts
Martin knew he was bound to things of substance but he followed the lure of property and accumulation as he might have followed some other game had he learned it knowing all along that it was a delusion and at the same time acknowledging that for him there was nothing else as sufficing
How simple if Bills future could be a settled thing in his mind as it was to the boys mother
Or his own future
If only he could believethen how different it would be for him
He could go on placidly and die with a smile
But he could not believe
His atheism was both mental and instinctive
It was something he could not understand and which he knew he could never change try as he might
Take this very evening
Here was death in his home
And he was escaping a lot of anguish not by praying for Bills soul or his own forgiveness but by the simple process of harnessing a team and dragging a car through the mud
It was a great game work wasthe one weapon with which to meet life
This was not a cut and dried philosophy with him but a glimmer that though always suggesting itself but dimly never failed when put to the test
Martin felt better
He began to probe a little farther albeit with an aimlessness about his questions that almost frightened him
He asked himself whether he loved Bill now that he was dead and he had to admit that he did not
The boy had always been something other than he had expected a disappointment
Did he love anyone
No
Not a person not even any longer that lovely Rose of Sharon who had flowered in his dust for a brief hour
His wife
God Almighty no
Then who
Himself
No his very selfishness had other springs than that
He was one of those men not so uncommon either he surmised who loved no one on the whole wide earth
When he reentered the house he found his wife still seated in the rocker softly weeping the tears flowing down her cheeks and dropping unheeded into her lap
He pitied her
I feel as though he didnt die tonight she mourned looking at Martin through full eyes
He died when he was born like the first one
I know how you feel said Martin sympathy in his voice
I made him so many promises before he came but I wasnt able to keep a single one of them
Im sorry I wish I could help you in some way
Oh Martin I know youre not a praying manbut if you could only learn
Martin looked at her respectfully but with profound curiosity
There must be an answer to all this Rose went on brokenly
There must
Billy is lying in the arms of Jesus nowno pain only sweet rest
I believe that
Im glad you have the faith that can put such meaning into it all
Martin I want to pray for strength to bear it
Yes Rose
Youll pray with me wont you
You just said I wasnt a praying man
Yes but I cant pray alone with him in there alone too and you here with me scoffing
I cant be other than I am Rose but you pray and as you pray Ill bow my head
X INTO THE DUSTBIN WITH the loss of her boy time ceased to exist for Rose
The days came and went lengthening into years full of duties leaving her as they found her outwardly little changed and habitually calm and kind but inwardly sunk in apathy
She moved as if in a dream seeming to live in a strange world that would never again seem realthis world without Billy
Occasionally she would forget and think he was out in the field or down in the mine more rarely still she would slip even further backward and wonder what he was about in his play
During these moments she would feel normal but some object catching her eye would jerk her back to the present and the cruel truth
She and Martin had less than ever to say to each other though in his own grim way he was more thoughtful giving her to understand that there were no longer any restrictions laid upon her purchasing and even suggesting that they remodel the house as if she thought impassively at this late day it could matter what she bought or in what she lived
His one interest in making money just as if they had some one to leave it to puzzled her
Always investing then reinvesting the interest and spending comparatively little of his income his fortune had now reached the point where it was growing rapidly of its own momentum and as there was nothing to which he looked forward nothing he particularly wanted to do he set himself the task of making it cross the half million mark much as a man plays solitaire to occupy his mind betting against himself to give point to his efforts
Yet it gave him a most disconcerting uncanny start when one bright winter day he faced the fact that he too was about to be shovelled into the great dustbin
Death was actually at his side his long bony finger on his shoulder and whispering impersonally Youre next
Very much thought Martin like a barber on a busy Saturday
How odd that here was something that had never entered into his schemes his carefully worked out plans
It seemed so unfairwhy he had been feeling so well his business had been going on so profitably there was something so substantial to the jog of his life there seemed to be something of the eternal about it
He had taken tenyear mortgages but a few days ago and had bought two thousand dollars worth of twentyyear Oklahoma municipals when he could have taken an earlier issue which he had rejected as maturing too soon
He had forgotten that there was a stranger who comes but once and now that he was here Martin felt that a mean trick had been played on him
He cogitated on the journey he was to take and it made him not afraid but angry
It was a shabby dealthats what it waswhen he was so healthy and contented only sixtyone and ready to go on for decadestwo or three at leastforced instead to prepare to lay himself in a padded box and be hurriedly packed away
It had always seemed so vague this business of dying and now it was so personalhe Martin Wade himself not somebody else would suffer a little while longer and then grow still forever
He would never know how sure a breeder was his new bullthe son of that fine creature he had imported two cows he had spotted as not paying their board could go on for months eating good alfalfa and bran before a new herdsman might become convinced of their unreadiness to turn the expensive feed into white gold he had not written down the dates when the sows were to farrow and they might have litters somewhere around the strawstack and crush half the little pigs
His one hundred and seventyfive acres of wheat had had north and south dead furrows but he had learned that this was a mistake in probably half the acreage where they should be east and west
It would make a great difference in the drainage but a new plowman might think this finickiness and just go ahead and plow all of it north and south or all of it east and west and this would result in a lower yieldsome parts of the field would get soggy and the wheat might get a rust and other parts drain too readily letting the ground become parched and break into cakes all of which might be prevented
And there was all that manure maker of big crops
He knew only too well how other farmers let it pile up in the barnyard to be robbed by the sun of probably twenty per cent of its strength
He figured quickly how it would hurt the crops that he had made traditional on Wade land
He considered these things and they worried him made him realize what a serious thing was death far more serious than the average person let himself believe
Martin had gone to the barn a week before to help a cow which was aborting
It had enraged him when he thought what an alarming thing this wasabortion among HIS cowsin Martin Wades beautiful herd
God Almighty
he had exclaimed deciding as he took the calf from the mother to begin doctoring her at once
He would fight this disease before it could establish a hold
Locking the cows head in an iron stanchion he had shed his coat rolled up his right sleeve almost to the shoulder washed his hand and arm in a solution of carbolic and hot water carefully examining them to make sure there was no abrasion of any kind
But despite his caution a tiny cut so small that it had escaped his searching had come in contact with the infected mucous membrane and blood poisoning had set in
And here he was lying in bed given up by Doctor Bradley and the younger men the older physician had called into consultation and who had tried in vain to stem the spread of poison through his system
Martin was going to die and no power could save him
The irony of it
This farm to which he had devoted his life was taking it from him by a member of its herd
Martin made a wry little grimace of amusement as he realized suddenly that even at the very gate of death it was still on life his life that his thoughts dwelt
In these last moments it was the tedious but stimulating battle of existence that really occupied his full attention
He would cling to it until the last snap of the thin string
This cavern of oblivion that was awaiting him that he must enterit was black and now more than ever his deep simple irreligion refused to let fairy tales pacify him with the belief that beyond it was everlasting daylight
Scepticism was not only in his conscious thought but in the very tissues of his mind
He remembered how his own father had died on this farmhe had had no possessions to think about only his loved ones his wife and his children but he had brought them here that they might amass property out of Martins sweat and the dust of the prairie
Now he the son dying had in his mind no thought of people but of this land and of stock and of things
And how strangely his mind was reacting to it
His concern was not who should own them all but what would actually be the fate of each individual property child of his
Why he had not even written a will
It would all go to his wife of course and how little he cared to whom she left it
He would have liked perhaps to have given Rose Mall twentyfive thousand or soso she could always be independent of that young husband of herssnap her fingers at him if he got to driving her too hard and crushing out the flowerlike quality of herbut his wife wouldnt have understood and he had hurt her enough in all conscience
The one thing he might have enjoyed doing he couldnt
Outside of that he didnt care who got it
She could leave it to whomever she liked when her turn came
Not to whom it went but what would happen to itthat was what concerned him
By his side Rose sitting so motionless that he was scarcely conscious of her presence was dying with him
With that peculiar gift of profoundly sympathetic natures she was thinking and feeling much of what he was experiencing
It seemed to her heartbreaking that Martin must be forced to abandon the only things for which he cared
He had even sacrificed his lovely Rose of Sharon for themshe had never been in any doubt as to the reason for that sudden emotional retreat of his seven years before
And she knew his one thought now must be for their successful administration
He had worked so hard always and yet had had so little happiness so little real brightness out of life
She felt generously with a clutching ache that with all the disappointments she had suffered through himfrom his first broken promises about the house to his lack of understanding of their boy which had resulted in Billys deathwith even that she had salvaged so much more out of living than he
A great compassion swelled within her all the black moments all the long gray hours of their years together seemed suddenly insignificant
She saw him again as he had been the day he had proposed marriage to her and for the first time she was sure that she could interpret the puzzling look that had come into his eyes when she had asked him why he thought she could make him happy
What had he understood about happiness
With a noiseless sob she remembered that he had answered her in terms of the only thing he had understoodwork
And she saw him again too as he had been the night he had so bluntly told her of his passion for Rose
It seemed to her now free of all rancor unutterably tragic that the only person Martin had loved should have come into his life too late
He was not to be blamed because he had never been able to care for herself
He should never have asked her to marry himand yet they had not been such bad partners
It would have been so easy for her to love him
She had loved him until he had killed her boy since then all her old affection had withered
But if it really had done so why was she so racked now
She felt desperately that she could not let him go until he had had some real joy
To think that she used to plan coldbloodedly when Billy was little all she would do if only Martin should happen to die
The memory of it smote her as with a blow
She looked down at the powerful hand lying so passively almost she would have said contentedly in her own
How she had yearned for the comfort of it when her children were born
She wondered if Martin realized her touch if it helped a little
If it had annoyed him he would have said so
It came to her oddly that in all the twentyseven years she and her husband had been married this was the very first time he had let her be tender to him
Oh his life had been bleak
Bleak
And she with such tenderness in her heart
It hadnt been right
From the depths of her rebellion and forgiveness slow tears rose
Feeling too intensely too mentally to be conscious of them she sat unmoving as they rolled one by one down her cheeks and dropped unheeded
Rose he called with a soft hoarseness I want to talk to you
Yes Martin and she gave his fingers a slight squeeze as though to convince him that she was there at his side
He felt relieved
It was good to feel her hand and be sure that if his body were to give its final sign that life had slipped away someone would be there to know the very second it had happened
It was a satisfactory way to die it took a little of the loneliness away from the experience
Rose he repeated
It sounded so new the yearning tone in which he said itRose
It hurt
Isnt it funny Rose to go like thisnot sick no accidentjust dying without any real reason except that I absorbed the poison through a cut so small my eyes couldnt see it
Its a mystery dear the little word limped out awkwardly but Gods ways are not ours
Not a mystery he corrected just a heap of tricks funny ones sad ones sensible ones and crazy onesand of all the crazy ones this is the worst
But whats the use
If theres a God as you believe it doesnt do any good to argue with Him and if its as I think and theres no God theres no one to argue with
But never mind about that nowits no matter
Youll listen carefully wont you Rose
Yes Martin
This abortion in the herd
You know what a terrible thing it is
I certainly do its the cause of your leaving me
Rose I know youll be busy during the next few daysme dying the things that have to be arranged the funeral and all that
But when its all over youll let that be the first thing wont you
Yes the very first thing if you wish it
I do
Get Dr Hurton on the job at once and have him fight it
He knows his business
Let him come twice a day until hes sure its out of the herd
Keep that new bull out of the pasture
And if Hurton cant clean it up youd better get rid of the herd before it gets known around the country
You know how news of that kind travels
Dont try to handle the sale yourself
If you do itll be a mistake
The prices will be low if you get only a county crowd
Neighbors usually bid low she agreed
Run up to Topeka and see Bakerhes the sales manager of the Holstein Breeders Association
Let him take charge of it allhes a straight fellow
Hell charge you enoughfifteen per cent of the gross receipts but then hell see to it that the people who want good stuff will be there
He knows how and where to advertise
Hes got a big list of names and can send out letters to the people that count
Hell bring buyers from Iowa down to Texas
Remember his nameBaker
Yes MartinBaker
I think you ought to sell the herd anyway he went on
I know you Rose youll be careless about the papersno woman ever realizes how important it is to have the facts for the certificates of registry and transfer just right
Im afraid youll fall down there and get the records mixed
You wont get the dates exact and the name and number of each dam and sire
Women are all alike therethey never seem to realize that a purebred without papers is just a good grade
Rose made no comment while Martin changed his position slowly and lost himself in thought
Yes I guess its the only thing to doto get rid of the purebred stuff
God Almighty
Its taken me long enough to build up that herd but a few weeks from now theyll be scattered to the four winds
Well it cant be helped
Try to sell them to men who understand something of their value
And that reminds me Rose
You always speak of them as thoroughbreds
It always did get on my nerves
Thats right for horses but try to remember that cows are purebreds
Youll make that mistake before men who know
Those little things are important
Remember it wont you
Thoroughbred for a horse and purebred for a cow Rose repeated willingly
When you get your money for the stock put it into mortgagesfirst mortgages not seconds
Let that be a principle with you
Many a holder of a second mortgage has been left to hold the sack
You must remember that the first mortgage comes in for the first claim after taxes and if the foreclosure doesnt bring enough to satisfy more than that the second mortgage is sleeping on its rights
First mortgages not seconds said Rose
And while Im on that let me warn you about Alex Tracy four miles north and a half mile east on the west side of the road
Hes a slippery cuss and youll have to watch him
Alex Tracy four miles north Youll find my mortgage for thirtyseven hundred in my box at the bank
Hes two coupons behind in his interest
I made him give me a chattel on his growing corn
Watch himhes treacherous
He may think he can sneak around because youre a woman and stall you
Hes just likely to turn his hogs into that corn
Your chattel is for growing corn not for corn in a hogs belly
If he tries any dirty business get the sheriff after him
Its on the GROWING corn said Rose
And heres another important pointtaxes
Dont pay any taxes on mortgages
Whats the use of giving the politicians more money to waste
Hold on to your bank stock and arrange to have all mortgages in the name of the bank not in your own
They pay taxes on their capital and surplus not on their loans
But be sure to get a written acknowledgment on each mortgage from Osborne
Hes square but you cant ever tell what changes might take place and then there might be some question about mortgages in the banks name
Keep them in the banks name said Rose
And a written acknowledgment Martin stressed
A written acknowledgment she echoed
For probably fifteen minutes he lay without further talk then a little more weariness in his voice than she had ever known before he began to speak again
Ive been thinking a great deal Rose
There was still that new tenderness in the manner in which he pronounced her name that new tone she had never heard before and which caused her to feel a little nervous
Ive been thinking Rose about the years weve lived together here on a Kansas prairie farm It lacks just a few months of being twentyeight years she added
Yes it sounds like a long time when you put it that way but it doesnt seem any longer than a short sigh to me lying here
Ive been thinking Rose how youve always got it over to me that you loved me or could love me Ive always loved you Martindeeply
Yes thats whats always made me so hard with you
It would have been far better for you if you hadnt cared for me at all
Ive never loved anybody not even my own mother nor Bill nor myself for that matter
Their eyes shifted away from each other quickly as both thought of one other whom he did not mention
I wasnt made that way Rose
Now you could love anythinglots of women are like that and men too
But I wasnt
Life to me has always been a strange world that I never got over thinking about and trying to understand and at the same time hustling to get through with every day of it as fast as I could by keeping at the only thing I knew which would make it all more bearable
Theres a lot of pain in work but its only of the muscles and my pain has always been in the things Ive thought about
The awful waste and futility of it all
Take this farmI came here when this was hardly more than a desert
You ought to have seen how thick the dust was the first day we got down here
And Ive built up this place
Youve helped me
Bill didnt care for iteven if he had lived hed never have stayed here
But you do in spite of all thats happened
Yes Martin I do she returned fervently
Its a wonderful monument to leave behind youthis farm is
His eyes grew somber
Thats what Ive always thought it would be he answered very low
Ive felt as if I was building something that would last
Even the barnstheyre ready to stand for generations
But this minute when the end is sitting at the foot of this bed I seem to see it all crumbling before me
You wont stay here
Why should you even if you do for a few years youll have to leave it sometime and theres nothing that goes to rack and ruin as quickly as a farmeven one like this
Oh Martin dont think such thoughts she begged
Your fever is coming up I can see it
What has it all been about thats what I want to know he went on with quiet cynicism
What have I been sweating aboutnothing
What is anyones life
No more than mine
Were all like a lot of hens in a backyard scratching so many hours a day
Some scratch a little deeper than those who arent so skilled or so strong
And when I stand off a little its all alike
The end is as blind and senseless as the beginning on this farmdrought and dust
Martin closed his eyes wearily and gave a deep sigh
To his wifes quickened ears it was charged with lingering regret for frustrated plans and palpitant with his consciousness of lifes evanescence and of the futility of his own success
She waited patiently for him to continue his instructions but the opiates had begun to take effect and Martin lapsed into sleep
Although he lived until the next morning he never again regained full consciousness
XI THE DUST SETTLES ROSES grief was a surprise to herself there was no blinking the fact that her life was going to be far more disrupted by Martins death than it had been by Bills
There were other differences
Where that loss had struck her numb this quickened every sensibility drove her into action more than that as she realized how much less there was to regret in the boys life than in his fathers how much more he had got out of his few short years the edge of the older more precious sorrow dulled
During quite long periods she would be so absorbed in her thoughts of Martin that Bill would not enter her mind
Was it possible that this husband who with his own lips had confessed he had never loved her had been a more integral part of herself than the son who had adored her
What was this bond that had roots deeper than love
Was it merely because they had grown so used to each other that she felt as if half of her had been torn away and buried leaving her crippled and helpless
Probably it would have been different if Bill had been living
Was it because when he had died she still had had Martin demanding vital to goad her on and give the semblance of a point to her life and now she was left alone adrift
She pondered over these questions broodingly
I suppose youll want to sell out Rose Nellies husband Bert Mall big and cordial as Peter had been before him suggested a day or two after the funeral
Ill try to get you a buyer or would you rather rent
I havent any plans yet Bert Mrs Wade had evaded adroitly its all happened so quickly
I have plenty of time and there are lots of things to be seen to
There had been that in her voice which had forbidden discussion and it was a tone to which she was forced to have recourse more than once during the following days when it seemed to her that all her friends were in a conspiracy to persuade her to a hasty illadvised upheaval
Nothing she resolved should push her from this farm or into final decisions until a year had passed
She must have something to which she could cling if it were nothing more than a familiar routine
Without that to sustain and support her she felt she could never meet the responsibilities which had suddenly descended with such a terrific impact upon her shoulders
In an inexplicable way these new burdens her black dressthe first silk one since the winter before Billy cameand the softening folds of her veil all invested her with a new and touching majesty that seemed to set her a little apart from her neighbors
Nellie had been frankly scandalized at the idea of mourning
Nobody does that out hereexceptin during the services she had said sharply to her daughterinlaw when Rose had told her of the hasty trip she and her aunt had made to the largest town in the county
Folksll think its funny and kind o silly
You oughtnt to have encouraged it
Oh Mother Mall I didnt especially the younger woman had protested
She just said in that quiet settled way she has that she was going toshe thought it would be easier for her
And I believe it will too she added feeling how pathetic it was that Aunt Rose had never looked half so well during Uncle Martins life as she had since his death
Oh well Mall commented Rose always was sort of sentimental but theres not many like her
Shes right to take her time too
Itll be six or eight months anyway before she can get things lined up
Shes got a longer head than a bodyd think for
Look at the way she run that newspaper office when old Conroy died
That was nearly thirty years ago commented his wife crisply and Roses got so used to being bossed around by Martin that shell find it aint so easy to go ahead on her own
With her usual shrewdness Nellie had surmised the chief difficulty but it dwindled in real importance because of the fact that Rose so frequently had the feeling that Martin merely had gone on a journey and would come home some day expecting an exact accounting of her stewardship
His instructions were to her living instructions which must be carried out to the letter
She had attended with conscientious promptness to checking the trouble that had brought about his death
I promised Mr Wade it should be the first thing she had explained to Dr Hurton
Youll let it be the first thing wont you
Those were his very words
He depended on us Doctor
When the time came to plan definitely for the disposal of the purebred herd she went herself to Topeka to arrange details with Baker
She was constantly thinking Now what would Martin say to this
or Would he approve of that
And her conclusions were reached accordingly
The sale itself was an event that was discussed in Fallon County for years afterwards
The hotel was crowded with outoftown buyers
Enthused by the music from two bands even the local people bid high and through it all Rose vigilant remembered everything Martin would have wanted remembered
She felt that even he would have been satisfied with the manner in which the whole transaction was handled and with the financial results
She began to take a new pleasure in everything the nervous pleasure one takes when going through an experience for what may be the last time
The threshinghow often she had toiled and sweated over those three days of dinners and suppers for twentytwo men
Now she recalled with an aching tightness about her heart how delicious had been her relaxation when the dinner dishes washed the table reset and the kitchen in scrupulous order with the last fly vanquished she and Nellie had luxuriated in that exquisite sense of leisure that only women know who have passed triumphantly through a heavy mornings work and have everything ready for the evening
Later there had been the stroll down to the field in the shade of the waning afternoon to find out what time the men would be in for supper and the sheer delight of breathing in the pungent smell of the straw as it came flying from the funnel looking with the sinking sun shining through it like a million bees swarming from a hive while the redbrown grain gushed a lush stream into the waiting wagon
It always makes me think of a ship sailing into port Nellie Rose had once exclaimed the crop coming in
It gives me a queer kind of giddiness makes me feel like laughing and crying all at once to which her sisterinlaw had returned with more than her usual responsiveness Yes its the most excitin time of the year unless its Christmas
More nebulous were the memories of those early mornings when she had paused in the midst of getting breakfast to sniff in the cloverladen air and think how wonderful it would be if only she neednt stay in the hot stuffy kitchen but could be free to call Bill and go picnicking or loaf deliciously under one of the big elms
Most precious of allthe evenings she and her boy had sat in the yard with the cool south breeze blowing up from the pasture the cows looking on placidly the frogs fluting rhythmically in the pond the birds chirping their goodnight calls and the dip and swell of the farm land pulling at them like a haunting tune almost too lovely to be endured
Oh there had been moments all the sweeter and more poignant because they had been so fleeting
As she passed successfully through one whole round of planting harvesting and garnering of grain she began to realize her own ability and to be tempted more and more seriously to remain on the farm
She understood it and Martin would have liked her to run it
If it had not been for the problem of keeping dependable hired hands and the sight of the minetipple which towering on the adjoining farm reminded her more and more constantly of Bill she would not even have considered the offer of Gordon Hamilton one of Fallons leading business men to buy her whole section
Theres a bunch going into this deal together Rose Bert Mall explained
They want to run a new branch of their street car line straight through here and theyre going to plat this quarter into streets and lots
The rest theyll split up into several farms and rent for the present
Its a speculation of course but the way the mines are moving north and west its likely thisll be a thickly settled camp in another two or three years
But they only offer seventyfive an acre Rose expostulated and its worth more than that as farm land
Theres none around here as fertile as Martin made thisand then all the improvements
Theyll have to dispose of them secondhand
Its a pity theyre in exactly the wrong spot
Well of course Im not advising you Rose he added but fortyfive thousand aint to be sneezed at is it when it comes in a lump and you own only the surface
You may wait a long while before you get another such bid
Seems to me youve worked hard enough
Id think youd want a rest
In the end Mrs Wade capitulated to what as Martin had foreseen so clearly was sooner or later inevitable
She was a little stunned by the vast amount of available money now in her possession and at her disposal
But its all dust in my hands she thought sadly
What do I want of so much
Its going to be a terrible worry
I dont even know who to leave it to and she sighed deeply pressing her hands with her old characteristic gesture to her heart
Everybody would approve she supposed if she left it to Rose and Frankher niece and Martins nephewbut she couldnt quite bring herself to welcome that ideanot yet
And anyway it might be better to divide it among more people so that it would bring more happiness
Her own needs were simple
The modest fiveroom house which she purchased was set on a pleasant paved street in Fallon and was obviously ample for her
She hoped that during part of each year she could rent the extra bedroom to some one preferably a boy like Bill who was attending high school
There was a barn for her horse and the one cow she would keep a neat little chickenhouse for the twentyfive hens that would more than supply her with eggs and summer fries and a small garage for Martins car
It would seem very strange she thought to have so few things to care for and she wondered how she would fill her time she whose one problem always had been how to achieve snatches of leisure
She saw herself jogging on and on gradually getting to be less able on her feet a little more helpless until she was one of those feeble old ladies who seem at the very antipodes of the busy mothers they have been in their prime
How could it be that she who had always been in such demand so needed so driven by real duties should have become suddenly such a supernumerary so footloose and unattached
But when it came to that wasnt Fallon full of others in the same circumstances
It was not an uncommon lot
There was Mrs McMurray
Rose remembered over what a jolly household she had reigned before she too had lost her husband and three children instead of just one like Billy
Two of them had been grown and married
Now she was living in a little cottage all alone doing sewing and nursing yet always so brave and cheerful not only that but interested really interested in living
And Mrs Nelson
Her children were living and married and happy but she had given up her home sold itthe pretty place with the hospitable yard that used to seem to be fairly spilling over with wholesome boisterous boys and chatty beribboned little girls
She was rooming with a family taking her meals at a restaurant keeping up her zest in tomorrow by running a shop
She thought of how her friend Mrs Robinson gracious democratic woman of wide sympathies that she was had lived alone after David Robinsons death taking his place as president of the bank during the years her only daughter Janet had been off at college and later travelling around the country on the stageof all things for a daughter of Fallon
When hadnt the town been full of these widowed elderly women made childless alike by life and by death
What others had met successfully she could also she told herself sternly and still the old Rose still struggling toward happiness she tried to think with a little enthusiasm of her new life of the things she would do for others
One recreation she would be able to enjoy to her hearts content when she moved into townthe movies
They would tide her over she felt gratefully
When she was too lonely she would go to them and shed her own troubles and problems by absorption in those of others
She who had been married for years and had borne two children without ever having had the joy of one overwhelming kiss would find romance at last for an hour as she identified herself with the charming heroines of the films
She was to surrender the farm and the crops as they stood in June but as there was to be no new immediate tenant in her old house it was easily arranged that she could continue in it until the cottage in Fallon would be empty in September
Meanwhile preparations were begun for the new car line which would pass where the big dairy barn was standing
As the latter went down board by board it seemed to Mrs Wade that this structure which in the building had been the sign and symbol of her surrender and heartbreak now in its destruction typified Martins life
It was as if Martin himself were being torn limb from limb
All that he had built would soon be dust
The sound of the cement breaking under the heavy sledges was almost more than she could bear
It was a relief to have the smaller buildings dragged bodily to other parts of the farm
Only once before in her memory had there been such a summer and such a drought
The corn leaves burned to a crisp brown the ground cracked and broke into cakes and dust piled high in thick velvety folds on weeds and grass
It seemed too strange for words to see others harvest the wheat and to know that the usual crop could not be put in
Rose was thankful when her last evening came
Most of her furniture had been moved in the morning her boxes had left in the afternoon and the last little accessories were now piled in the car
As hand on the wheel she paused a moment before starting she was conscious of a choking sensation
It was over finishedshe the last of Martin was leaving it for good
Before her rolled the quarter section except for the little boxhouse as bare of fences and buildings as when the Wades had first camped on it in their prairie schooner
With what strange prophetic vision had Martin foreseen so clearly that all the construction of his life would crumble
Would Jacob and Sarah Wade have had the courage to make all their sacrifices she wondered if they had known that she and she alone daughter of a Patrick and Norah Conroy whom they had never seen would some day stand there profiting by it all
She thought of the mortgages in the bank and the bonds of the easier life she seemed to be entering
How strange that she whom Grandfather and Grandmother Wade had not even known she whom Martin had never loved should be the one to reap the real benefits from their planning and that the farm itself for which her husband had been willing to sacrifice Billy and herself should be utterly destroyed
A sudden breeze caught up some of the dust and whirling it around let it fall
Martins life thought Rose it was like a handful of dust thrown into Gods face and blown back again by the wind to the ground
