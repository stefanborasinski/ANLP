DANNYS OWN STORY BY DON MARQUIS TO MY WIFE CHAPTER I HOW I come not to have a last name is a question that has always had more or less aggervation mixed up with it
I might of had one jest as well as not if Old Hank Walters hadnt been so allfired infernal bullheaded about things in gineral and his wife Elmira a blame sight worse and both of em ready to row at a minutes notice and stick to it forevermore
Hank he was considerable of a lusher
One Saturday night when he come home from the vil lage in his usual fix he stumbled over a basket that was setting on his front steps
Then he got up and drawed back his foot unsteady to kick it plumb into kingdom come
Jest then he hearn Elmira opening the door behind him and he turned his head sudden
But the kick was already started into the air and when he turns he cant stop it
And so Hank gets twisted and falls down and steps on himself
That basket lets out a yowl
Its kittens says Hank still setting down and staring at that there basket
All of which you understand I am atelling you from hearsay as the lawyers always asts you in court
Elmira she sings out Kittens nothing
Its a baby
And she opens the basket and looks in and it was me
Hennerey Walters she says  picking me up and shaking me at him like I was a crime Hen nerey Walters where did you get this here baby
She always calls him Hennerey when she is getting ready to give him fits
Hank he scratches his head for hes kind o confuddled and thinks mebby he really has brought this basket with him
He tries to think of all the places he has been that night
But he cant think of any place but Bill Nolans saloon
So he says Elmira honest I aint had but one drink all day
And then he kind o rouses up a little bit and gets surprised and says That a BABY you got there Elmira
And then he says dignified So fur as thats consarned Elmira where did YOU get that there baby
She looks at him and she sees he dont really know where I come from
Old Hank mostly was truth ful when lickered up fur that matter and she knowed it fur he couldnt think up no lies excepting a gineral denial when intoxicated up to the gills
Elmira looks into the basket
They was one of them long rubber tubes stringing out of a bottle that was in it and I had been sucking that bottle when interrupted
And they wasnt nothing else in that basket but a big thick shawl which had been wrapped all around me and Elmira often wore it to meeting afterward
She goes inside and she looks at the bottle and me by the light and Old Hank he comes stumbling in afterward and sets down in a chair and waits to get Hail Columbia for coming home in that shape sos he can row back agin like they done every Saturday night
Blowed in the glass of the bottle was the name Daniel Dunne and Company
Anybody but them two old ignoramuses could of told right off that that didnt have nothing to do with me but was jest the company that made them kind of bottles
But she reads it out loud three or four times and then she says His name is Daniel Dunne she says
And Company says Hank feeling right quarrelsome
COMPANY haint no name says she
WHY haint it Id like to know
says Hank
I knowed a man oncet whose name was Farmer and if a farmers a name why aint a company a name too
His name is Daniel Dunne says Elmira quiet like but not dodging a row neither
AND COMPANY says Hank getting onto his feet like he always done when he seen trouble coming
When Old Hank was full of licker he knowed jest the ways to aggervate her the worst
She might of banged him one the same as usual and got her own eye blacked also the same as usual but jest then I lets out another big yowl and she give me some milk
I guess the only reason they ever kep me at first was so they could quarrel about my name
Theyd lived together a good many years and quarrelled about everything else under the sun and was running out of subjects
A new subject kind o briskened things up fur a while
But finally they went too far with it one time
I was about two years old then and he was still calling me Company and her calling me Dunne
This time he hits her a lick that lays her out and likes to kill her and it gets him scared
But she gets around agin after a while and they both see it has went too fur that time and so they makes up
Elmira I give in says Hank
His name is Dunne
No says she tenderlike you was right Hank
His name is Company
So they pretty near got into another row over that
But they finally made it up between em I didnt have no last name and theyd jest call me Danny
Which they both done faithful ever after as agreed
Old Hank he was a blacksmith and he used to lamm me considerable him and his wife not having any kids of their own to lick
He lammed me when he was drunk and he whaled me when he was sober
I never helt it up agin him much neither not fur a good many years because he got me used to it young and I hadnt never knowed nothing else
Hanks wife Elmira she used to lick him jest about as often as he licked her and boss him jest as much
So he fell back on me
A man has jest naturally got to have something to cuss around and boss sos to keep himself from finding out he dont amount to nothing
Leastways most men is like that
And Hank he didnt amount to much and he kind o knowed it way down deep in his inmost gizzards and it were a comfort to him to have me around
But they was one thing he never sot no store by and I got along now to where I hold that up agin him moren all the lickings he ever done
That was book learning
He never had none himself and he was sot agin it and he never made me get none and if Id ever asted him for any hed of whaled me fur that
Hanks wife Elmira had married beneath her and everybody in our town had come to see it and used to sympathize with her about it when Hank wasnt around
Shed tell em yes it was so
Back in Elmira New York from which her father and mother come to our part of Illinoise in the early days her father had kep a hotel and they was stylish kind o folks
When she was born her mother was homesick fur all that style and fur York State ways and so she named her Elmira
But when she married Hank he had considerable land
His father had left it to him but it was all swamp land and so Hanks father he hunted moren he farmed and Hank and his brothers done the same when he was a boy
But Hank he learnt a little blacksmithing when he was growing up cause he liked to tinker around and to show how stout he was
Then when he married Elmira Appleton he had to go to work practising that perfession reglar because he never learnt nothing about farming
Hed sell fifteen or twenty acres every now and then and theyd be high times till hed spent it up and mebby Elmira would get some new clothes
But when I was found on the door step the land was all gone and Hank was practising reglar when not busy cussing out the fellers that had bought the land
Fur some smart fellers had come along and bought up all that swamp land and dreened it and now it was worth seventy or eighty dollars an acre
Hank he figgered some one had cheated him
Which the Walterses could of dreened theirn too only theyd ruther hunt ducks and have fish frys than to dig ditches
All of which I hearn Elmira talking over with the neighbours moren once when I was growing up and they all says How sad it is you have came to this Elmira
And then shed kind o spunk up and say thanks to glory shed kep her pride
Well they was worse places to live in than that there little town even if they wasnt no railroad within eight miles and only three hundred soles in the hull copperation
Which Hanks shop and our house set in the edge of the woods jest outside the copperation line sos the city marshal didnt have no authority to arrest him after he crossed it
They was one thing in that house I always admired when I was a kid
And that was a big cistern
Most people has their cisterns outside their house and they is a tin pipe takes all the rain water off the roof and scoots it into them
Ourn worked the same but our cistern was right in under our kitchen floor and they was a trap door with leather hinges opened into it right by the kitchen stove
But that wasnt why I was so proud of it
It was because that cistern was jest plumb full of fish  bullheads and red horse and sunfish and other kinds
Hanks father had built that cistern
And one time he brung home some live fish in a bucket and dumped em in there
And they growed
And they multiplied in there and refurnished the earth
So that cistern had got to be a fambly custom which was kep up in that fambly for a habit
It was a great comfort to Hank fur all them Walterses was great fish eaters though it never went to brains
We fed em now and then and throwed back in the little ones till they was growed and kep the dead ones picked out soons we smelled anything wrong and it never hurt the water none and when I was a kid I wouldnt of took anything fur living in a house like that
Oncet when I was a kid about six years old Hank come home from the barroom
He got to chasing Elmiras cat cause he says it was making faces at him
The cistern door was open and Hank fell in
Elmira was over to town and I was scared
She had always told me not to fool around there none when I was a little kid fur if I fell in there Id be a corpse quickern scatt
So when Hank fell in and I hearn him splash being only a little feller and awful scared because Elmira had always made it so strong I hadnt no sort of unbelief but what Hank was a corpse already
So I slams the trap door shut over that there cistern without looking in fur I hearn Hank flopping around down in there
I hadnt never hearn a corpse flop before and didnt know but what it might be some how injurious to me and I wasnt going to take no chances
So I went out and played in the front yard and waited fur Elmira
But I couldnt seem to get my mind settled on playing I was a horse nor nothing
I kep thinking mebby Hanks corpse is going to come flopping out of that cistern and whale me some unusual way
I hadnt never been licked by a corpse and didnt rightly know jest what one is anyhow being young and comparitive innocent
So I sneaks back in and sets all the flatirons in the house on top of the cistern lid
I hearn some flop ping and splashing and spluttering like Hanks corpse is trying to jump up and is falling back into the water and I hearn Hanks voice and got scareder yet
And when Elmira come along down the road she seen me by the gate acrying and she asts me why
Hank is a corpse says I blubbering
A corpse
says Elmira dropping her coffee which she was carrying home from the gineral store and postoffice
Danny what do you mean
I seen I was to blame somehow and I wisht then I hadnt said nothing about Hank being a corpse
And I made up my mind I wouldnt say nothing more
So when she grabs holt of me and asts me agin what did I mean I blubbered harder jest the way a kid will and says nothing else
I wisht I hadnt set them flatirons on that door fur it come to me all at oncet that even if Hank HAS turned into a corpse I aint got any right to keep him in that cistern
Jest then Old Mis Rogers which is one of our neighbours comes by while Elmira is shaking me and yelling out what did I mean and how did it happen and had I saw it and where was Hanks corpse
And Mis Rogers she says Whats Danny been doing now Elmira
me being always up to some thing
Elmira she turned around and seen her and she gives a whoop and then hollers out Hank is dead
and throws her apern over her head and sets right down in the path and boohoos like a baby
And I bellers louder
Mis Rogers she never waited to ast nothing more
She seen she had a piece of news and shes bound to be the first to spread it like they is always a lot of women wants to be in them country towns
She run right acrost the road to where the Alexan derses lived
Mis Alexander she seen her coming and unhooked the screen door and Mis Rogers she hollers out before she reached the porch Hank Walters is dead
And then she went footing it up the street
They was a black plume on her bunnet which nodded the same as on a hearse and she was into and out of seven front yards in five minutes
Mis Alexander she runs acrost the street to where we was and she kneels down and puts her arm around Elmira which was still rocking back and forth in the path and she says How do you know hes dead Elmira
I seen him not moren an hour ago
Danny seen it all says Elmira
Mis Alexander turned to me and wants to know what happened and how it happened and where it happened
But I dont want to say nothing about that cistern
So I busts out bellering freshern ever and I says He was drunk and he come home drunk and he done it then and thats how he cone it I says
And you seen him
she says
I nodded
Where is he
says she and Elmira both to oncet
But I was scared to say nothing about that there cistern so I jest bawled some more
Was it in the blacksmith shop
says Mis Alexander
I nodded my head agin and let it go at that
Is he in there now
asts Mis Alexander
I nodded agin
I hadnt meant to give out no untrue stories
But a kid will always tell a lie not meaning to tell one if you sort of invite him with questions like that and get him scared the way youre acting
Besides I says to myself so long as Hank has turned into a corpse and that makes him dead whats the difference whether hes in the black smith shop or not
Fur I hadnt had any plain idea being such a little kid that a corpse meant to be dead and wasnt sure what being dead was like neither except they had funerals over you then
I knowed being a corpse must be some sort of a big disad vantage from the way Elmira always says keep away from that cistern door or Ill be one
But if they was going to be a funeral in our house Id feel kind o important too
They didnt have em every day in our town and we hadnt never had one of our own
So Mis Alexander she led Elmira into the house both acrying and Mis Alexander trying to comfort her and me a tagging along behind holding onto Elmiras skirts and sniffling into them
And in a few minutes all them women Mis Rogers has told come filing into that room one at a time looking sad
Only Old Mis Primrose she was awful late getting there because she stopped to put on her bunnet she always wore to funerals with the black Paris lace on it her cousin Arminty White had sent her from Chicago
When they found out Hank had come home with licker in him and done it himself they was all excited and they all crowds around and asts me how except two as is holding onto Elmiras hands which sets moaning in a chair
And they all asts me questions as to what I seen him do which if they hadnt I wouldnt have told em the lies I did
But they egged me on to it
Says one woman Danny you seen him do it in the blacksmith shop
I nodded
But how did he get in
sings out another woman
The door was locked on the outside with a padlock jest now when I come by
He couldnt of killed himself in there and locked the door on the outside
I didnt see how he could of done that myself so I begun to bawl agin and said nothing at all
He must of crawled through that little side window says another one
It was open when I come by if the door WAS locked
Did you see him crawl through the little side window Danny
I nodded
They wasnt nothing else fur me to do
But YOU haint tall enough to look through that there window says another one to me
How could you see into that shop Danny
I didnt know so I didnt say nothing at all I jest sniffled
They is a store box right in under that window says another one
Danny must have clumb onto that store box and looked in after he seen Hank come down the road and crawl through the window
Did you scramble onto the store box and look in Danny
I jest nodded agin
And what was it you seen him do
How did he kill himself
they all asts to oncet
I didnt know
So I jest bellers and boohoos some more
Things was getting past anything I could see the way out of
He might of hung himself to one of the iron rings in the jists above the forge says another woman
He clumb onto the forge to tie the rope to one of them rings and he tied the other end around his neck and then he stepped offn the forge
Was that how he done it Danny
I nodded
And then I bellered louder than ever
I knowed Hank was down in that there cistern a corpse and a mighty wet corpse all this time but they kind o got me to thinking mebby he was hang ing out in the shop by the forge too
And I guessed Id better stick to the shop story not wanting to say nothing about that cistern no soonern I could help it
Pretty soon one woman says kind o shivery I dont want to have the job of opening the door of that blacksmith shop the first one
And they all kind o shivered then and looked at Elmira
They says to let some of the men open it
And Mis Alexander she says shell run home and tell her husband right off
And all the time Elmira is moaning in that chair
One woman says Elmira orter have a cup o tea which shell lay off her bunnet and go to the kitchen and make it fur her
But Elmira says no she cant abear to think of tea with poor Hennerey ahang ing out there in the shop
But she was kind o enjoying all that fuss being made over her too
And all the other women says Poor thing
But all the same they was mad she said she didnt want any tea for they all wanted some and didnt feel free without she took it too
Which she said she would after theyd coaxed a while and made her see her duty
So they all goes out to the kitchen bringing along some of the best room chairs Elmira coming too and me tagging along behind
And the first thing they noticed was them flatirons on top of the cistern door
Mis Primrose she says that looks funny
But another woman speaks up and says Danny must of been playing with them while Elmira was over town
She says Was you playing they was horses Danny
I was feeling considerable like a liar by this time but I says I was playing horses with them fur I couldnt see no use in hurrying things up
I was bound to get a lamming purty soon anyhow
When I was a kid I could always bet on that
So they picks up the flatirons and as they picks em up they come a splashing noise in the cistern
I thinks to myself Hanks corpsell be out of there in a minute
One woman she says Goodness gracious sakes alive
Whats that Elmira
Elmira says that cistern is mighty full of fish and they is some great big ones in there and it must be some of them aflopping around
Which if they hadnt of been all worked up and talking all to oncet and all thinking of Hanks body hanging out there in the blacksmith shop they might of suspicioned something
For that flopping kep up steady and a lot of splashing too
I mebby orter mentioned sooner it had been a dry summer and they was only three or four feet of water in our cistern and Hank wasnt in scarcely up to his big hairy chest
So when Elmira says the cistern is full of fish that woman opens the trap door and looks in
Hank thinks its Elmira come to get him out
He allows hell keep quiet in there and make believe he is drowned and give her a good scare and make her sorry fur him
But when the cistern door is opened he hears a lot of clacking tongues all of a sudden like they was a hen convention on
He allows she has told some of the neighbours and hell scare them too
So Hank he laid low
And the woman as looks in sees nothing for its as dark down there as the insides of the whale what swallered Noah
But she leaves the door open and goes on amaking tea and they aint skeercly a sound from that cistern only little ripply noises like it might have been fish
Pretty soon a woman says It has drawed Elmira wont you have a cup
Elmira she kicked some more but she took hern
And each woman took hern
And one woman asipping of hern she says The departed had his good pints Elmira
Which was the best thing had been said of Hank in that town fur years and years
Old Mis Primrose she always prided herself on being honest no matter what come and she ups and says I dont believe in no hippercritics at a time like this no moren no other time
The departed wasnt no good and the hull town knowed it and Elmira orter feel like its good riddance of bad rubbish and them is my sentiments and the senti ments of rightfulness
All the other women sings out Wy MIS PRIMROSE
I never
And they seemed awful shocked
But down in underneath more of em agreed than let on
Elmira she wiped her eyes and she said Hennerey and me has had our troubles
They aint any use in denying that Mis Primrose
It has often been give and take between us and betwixt us
And the hull town knows he has lifted his hand agin me moren oncet
But I always stood up to Hennerey and I fit him back free and fair and open
I give him as good as he sent on this here earth and I aint the one to carry no annermosities be yond the grave
I forgive Hank all the orneriness he done me and they was a lot of it as is becoming unto a church member which he never was
And all the women but Mis Primrose they says Elmira Appleton you HAVE got a Christian sperrit
Which done her a heap of good and she cried considerable harder leaking out tears as fast as she poured tea in
Each one on em tries to find out something good to say about Hank only they wasnt much they could say
And Hank in that there cistern alistening to every word of it
Mis Rogers she says Afore he took to drinking like a fish Hank Walters was as likely looking a young feller as I ever see
Mis White she says Well Hank he never was a stingy man nohow
Often and often White has told me about seeing Hank after hed sold a piece of land treating the hull town down in Nolans barroom jest as come easy goeasy as if it wasnt money he orter paid his honest debts with
They set there thataway telling of what good pints they could think of fur ten minutes and Hank ahearing it and getting madder and madder all the time
The gineral opinion was that Hank wasnt no good and was better done fur and no matter what they said them feelings kep sticking out through the words
By and by Tom Alexander come busting into the house and his wife Mis Alexander was with him
Whats the matter with all you folks he says
They aint nobody hanging in that there black smith shop
I broke the door down and went in and it was empty
Then they was a pretty howdydo and they all sings out Wheres the corpse
And some thinks mebby some one has cut it down and took it away and all gabbles to oncet
But for a minute no one thinks mebby little Danny has been egged on to tell lies
Little Danny aint saying a word
But Elmira she grabs me and shakes me and she says You little liar you what do you mean by that tale you told
I thinks that lamming is about due now
But whilst all eyes is turned on me and Elmira they comes a voice from that cistern
It is Hanks voice and he sings out Tom Alexander is that you
Some of the women scream for some thinks it is Hanks ghost
But one woman says what would a ghost be doing in a cistern
Tom Alexander he laughs and he says What in blazes you want to jump in there fur Hank
You dern ijut
says Hank you quit mocking me and get a ladder and when I get outn here Ill learn you to ast what did I want to jump in here fur
You never seen the day you could do it says Tom Alexander meaning the day he could lick him
And if you feel that way about it you can stay there fur all of me
I guess a little water wont hurt you none
And he left the house
Elmira sings out Hank mad and bossy you go get me a ladder
But Elmira her temper riz up too all of a sudden
Dont you dare order me around like I was the dirt under your feet Hennerey Walters she says
At that Hank fairly roared he was so mad
He says Elmira when I get outn here Ill give you what you wont fergit in a hurry
I hearn you aforgiving me and aweeping over me and I wont be forgive nor weeped over by no one
You go and get that ladder
But Elmira only answers You wasnt sober when you fell into there Hennerey Walters
And now you can jest stay in there till you get a better temper on you
And all the women says Thats right Elmira spunk up to him
They was considerable splashing around in the water fur a couple of minutes
And then all of a sudden a live fish come awhirling out of that hole which he had ketched it with his hands
It was a big bullhead and its whiskers around its mouth was stiffened into spikes and it lands kerplump into Mis Rogerss lap awiggling and it kind o horns her on the hands and she is that surprised she faints
Mis Primrose she gets up and pushes that fish back into the cistern with her foot from the floor where it had fell and she says right decided Elmira Walters that was Elmira Appleton if you let Hank outn that cistern before he has signed the pledge and promised to jine the church youre a bigger fool n I take you to be
A woman has got to make a stand
With that she marches outn our house
Then all the women sings out Send fur Brother Cartwright
Send fur Brother Cartwright
And they sent me scooting acrost town to get him quick
Which he was the preacher of the Baptist church and lived next to it
And I hadnt got no lamming yet
CHAPTER II I never stopped to tell but two three folks on the way to Brother Cartwrights but they must of spread it quick
Cause when I got back home with him it seemed like the hull town was there
It was along about dusk by this time and it was a prayermeeting night at the church
Mr Cartwright told his wife to tell the folks what come to the prayermeeting hed be back before long and to wait fur him
Which she really told them where he had went and what fur
Mr Cartwright marches right into the kitchen
All the chairs in our house was into the kitchen and the women was atalking and alaughing and they had sent over to Alexanderses for their chairs and to Rogerses for theirn
Every oncet in a while they would be a awful bust of language come up from that hole where that unreginerate old sinner was cooped up in
I have travelled around considerable since them days and I have mixed up along of many kinds of people in many different places and some of em was cussers to admire
But I never hearn such cussing before or since as old Hank done that night
He busted his own records and riz highern his own water marks for previous times
I wasnt nothing but a little kid then and skeercly fitten fur to ad mire the full beauty of it
They was deep down cusses that come from the heart
Looking back at it after all these years I can believe what Brother Cartwright said himself that night that it wasnt natcheral cussing and some higher power like a demon or a evil sperrit must of entered into Hanks human carkis and give that turrible eloquence to his remarks
It busted out every few minutes and the women would put their fingers into their ears till a spell was over
And it was personal too
Hank he would listen until he hearn a womans voice that he knowed and then he would let loose on her fambly going backwards to her grandfathers and downwards to her childrens children
If her father had once stolen a hog or her husband done any disgrace that got found out on him Hank would put it all into his gineral remarks with trimmings onto it
Brother Cartwright he steps up to the hole in the floor when he first comes in and he says gentle like and soothing like a undertaker when he tells you where to set at a home funeral Brother Walters
Brother
Hank yells out dont ye brother me you sniffling psalmsinging yallerfaced pigeontoed hippercrit you
Get me a ladder gol dern you and Ill come outn here and learn you to brother me I will
Only that wasnt nothing to what Hank really said to that preacher no more like it than a little yaller fluffy canary is like a buzzard
Brother Walters says the preacher caam but firm we have all decided that you aint going to come out of that cistern till you sign the pledge
And Hank tells him what he thinks of pledges and him and church doings and it wasnt purty
And he says if he was as deep in eternal fire as what he now is in rainwater and every fish that nibbles at his toes was a preacher with a redhot pitchfork ajabbing at him they could jab till the hull here after turned into snow afore hed ever sign nothing a man like Mr Cartwright give him to sign
Hank was stubborner than any mule he ever nailed shoes onto and proud of being that stubborn
That town was a awful religious town and Hank he knowed he was called the most onreligious man in it and he was proud of that too and if any one called him a heathen it jest plumb tickled him all over
Brother Walters says that preacher we are going to pray for you
And they done it
They brought all them chairs close up around that cistern in a ring and they all kneeled down there with their heads on em and they prayed fur Hanks salvation
They done it up in style too one at a time and the others singing out Amen
every now and then and they shed tears down onto Hank
The front yard was crowded with men all alaughing and atalking and chawing and spitting tobacco and betting how long Hank would hold out
Old Si Emery that was the city marshal and always wore a big nickel plated star was out there with em
Si was in a sweat cause Bill Nolan that run the barroom and some more of Hanks friends or as near friends as he had was out in the road
They says to Si he must arrest that preacher fur Hank is being gradual murdered in that there water and hell die if hes helt there too long and it will be a crime
Only they didnt come into the yard to say it amongst us religious folks
But Si he says he dassent arrest no one because it is outside the town copperation but hes considerable worried too about what his duty orter be
Pretty soon the gang that Mrs Cartwright has rounded up at the prayermeeting comes stringing along in
They had all brung their hymn books with them and they sung
The hull town was there then and they all sung and they sung re vival hymns over Hank
And Hank he would jest cuss and cuss
Every time he busted out into another cussing spell they would start another hymn
Finally the men out in the front yard got warmed up too and begun to sing all but Bill Nolans crowd and they give Hank up for lost and went away disgusted
The first thing you knowed they was a reglar revival meeting there and that preacher was preaching a reglar revival sermon
I been to moren one camp meeting but fur jest natcherally taking holt of the hull human race by the slack of its pants and dangling of it over hellfire I never hearn nothing could come up to that there sermon
Two or three old backsliders in the crowd come right up and repented all over agin on the spot
The hull kit and biling of em got the power good and hard like they does at camp meetings and revivals
But Hank he only cussed
He was obstinate Hank was and his pride and dander had riz up
Finally he says Youre taking a ornery lowdown advantage o me you are
Let me outn this here cistern and Ill show you wholl stick it out longest on dry land dern your religious hides
Some of the folks there hadnt had no suppers so after all the other sinners but Hank had either got converted or else sneaked away some of the women says why not make a kind of love feast out of it and bring some vittles like they does to church sociables
Because it seems likely Satan is going to wrastle all night long like he done with the angel Jacob and they ought to be prepared
So they done it
They went and they come back with vittles and they made up hot coffee and they feasted that preacher and theirselves and Elmira and me all right in Hanks hearing
And Hank was getting hungry himself
And he was cold in that water
And the fish was nibbling at him
And he was getting cussed out and weak and soaked full of despair
And they wasnt no way fur him to set down and rest
And he was scared of getting a cramp in his legs and sinking down with his head under water and being drownded
He said afterward hed of done the last with pleasure if they was any way of suing that crowd fur murder
So along about ten oclock he sings out I give in gosh dern ye
I give in
Let me out and Ill sign your pesky pledge
Brother Cartwright was fur getting a ladder and letting him climb out right away
But Elmira she says Dont you do it Brother Cartwright dont you do it
You dont know Hank Walters like I does
If he oncet gets out o there before hes signed that pledge he wont never sign it
So they fixed it up that Brother Cartwright was to write out a pledge on the inside leaf of the Bible and tie the Bible onto a string and a lead pencil onto another string and let the strings down to Hank and he was to make his mark fur he couldnt write and they was to be pulled up agin
Hank he says all right and they done it
But jest as Hank was making his mark on the leaf of the book that preacher done what I has always thought was a mean trick
He was lying on the floor with his head and shoulders into that hole as fur as he could holding a lantern way down into it so as Hank could see
And jest as Hank made that mark he spoke some words over him and then he says Now Henry Walters I have baptized you and you are a member of the church
Youd a thought Hank would of broke out cussing agin at being took unexpected thataway fur he hadnt really agreed to nothing but signing the pledge
But nary a cuss
He jest says Now you get that ladder
They got it and he clumb up into the kitchen dripping and shivering
You went and baptized me in that water
he asts the preacher
The preacher says he has
Then says Hank you done a lowdown trick on me
You knowed I has made my brags I never jined no church nor never would jine
You knowed I was proud of that
You knowed that it was my glory to tell of it and that I set a heap of store by it in every way
And now youve went and took it away from me
You never fought it out fair and square neither man playing to outlast man like you done with this here pledge but you sneaked it in on me when I wasnt looking
They was a lot of men in that crowd that thought the preacher had went too far and sympathized with Hank
The way he done about that hurt Brother Cartwright in our town and they was a split in the church because some said it wasnt reglar and wasnt binding
He lost his job after a while and become an evangelist
Which it dont make no difference what one of them does nohow
But Hank he always thought he had been bap tized reglar
And he never was the same after ward
He had made his lifelong brags and his pride was broke in that there one perticler spot
And he sorrered and grieved over it a good eal and got grouchier and grouchier and meaner and meaner and lickered oftener if anything
Signing the pledge couldnt hold Hank
He was worse in every way after that night in the cistern and took to lamming me harder and harder
CHAPTER III Well all the lammings Hank laid on never done me any good
It seemed like I was jest natcherally cut out to have no success in life and no amount of whaling could change it though Hank he was faithful
Before I was twelve years old the hull town had seen it and they wasnt nothing else expected of me except not to be any good
That had its handy sides to it too
They was lots of kids there that had to go to school but Hank he never would of let me done that if I had ast him and I never asted
And they was lots of kids considerably bothered all the time with their parents and relations
They made em go to Sunday School and wash up reglar all over on Saturday nights and put on shoes and stockings part of the time even in the summer and some of em had to ast to go in swimming and the hull thing was a continuous trouble and privation to em
But they wasnt nothing perdicted of me and I done like it was perdicted
Everybody lowed from the start that Hank would of made trash outn me even if I hadnt showed all the signs of being trash anyhow
And if they was devilment anywhere about that town they all says Danny he done it
And like as not I has
So I gets to be what you might call an outcast
All the kids whose folks aint trash their mothers tells em not to run with me no more
Which they done it all the more fur that reason on the sly and it makes me more important with them
But when I gets a little bigger all that makes me feel kind o bad sometimes
It aint so handy then
Fur folks gets to saying when I would come around Danny what do YOU want
And if I says Nothing they would say Well then you get out o here
Which they neednt of been suspicioning nothing like they pertended they did fur I never stole nothing moren worter millions and mush millions and such truck and mebby now and then a chicken us kids use to roast in the woods on Sundays and jest as like as not it was one of Hanks hens then which I figgered Id earnt it
Fur Hank he had streaks when hed work me considerable hard
He never give me any money fur it
He loafed a lot too and when hed loaf Id loaf
But I did pick up right smart of handiness with tools around that there shop of hisn and if hed ever of used me right I might of turned into a purty fair blacksmith
But it wasnt no use trying to work fur Hank
When I was about fifteen times is right bad around the house fur a spell and Elmira is working purty hard and I thinks to myself Well these folks has kind o brung you up and you aint never done moren Hank made you do
Mebby you orter stick to work a little more when theys a job in the shop even if Hank dont
Which I tried it fur about two or three years doing as much work around the shop as Hank done and mebby more
But it wasnt no use
One day when Im about eighteen I seen awful plain Ill have to light out from there
They was a circus come to town that day
I says to Hank Hank they is a circus this afternoon and agin tonight
So I has hearn says Hank
Are you going to it
says I
I mout says Hank and then agin I moutnt
I dont see as its no consarns of yourn nohow
I knowed he was going though
Hank he never missed a circus
Well I says they wasnt no harm to ast was they
Well youve asted aint you
says Hank
Well then says I Id like to go to that there circus myself
They aint no use in me saying fur you not to go says Hank fur you would go anyhow
You always does go off when you is needed
But I aint got no money I says and I was going to ast you could you spare me half a dollar
Great Jehosephat
says Hank but aint you getting stuck up
Whats the matter of you crawling in under the tent like you always done
First thing I know youll be wanting a pair of these here yaller shoes and a stovepipe hat
No says I I aint no dude Hank and you know it
But they is always things about a circus to spend money on besides jest the circus herself
They is the side show fur instance and they is the grand concert afterward
I calkelated Id take em all in this yearthe hull dern thing jest fur oncet
Hank he looks at me like Id asted fur a house n lot or a million dollars or something like that
But he dont say nothing
He jest snorts
Hank I says I been doing right smart work around the shop fur two three years now
If you wasnt loafing so much youd a noticed it more
And I aint never ast fur a cent of pay fur it nor You aint wuth no pay says Hank
You aint wuth nothing but to eat vittles and wear out clothes
Well I says I figger I earn my vittles and a good eal more
And as fur as clothes goes I never had none but what Elmira made outn yourn
Who brung you up
asts Hank
You done it says I and by your own sayso you done a dern poor job at it
You go to that there circus says Hank aflaring up and Ill lambaste you up to a inch of your life
So fur as handing out money fur you to sling it to the dogs I aint no bank and if I was I aint no ijut
But you jest let me hear of you even going nigh that circus lot and all the lammings you has ever got rolled into one wont be a measly little sarcumstance to what you WILL get
They aint no leatherfaced young upstart with weepinwillow hail going to throw up to me how I brung him up
Thats gratitood fur you that is
says Hank
If it hadnt of been fur me giving you a home when I found you first where would you of been now
Well I says I might of been a good eal better off
If you hadnt of took me in the Alexan derses would of and then I wouldnt of been kep out of school and growed up a ignoramus like you is
I never had no trouble keeping you away from school I notice says Hank with a snort
This is the first I ever hearn of you wanting to go there
Which was true in one way and a lie in another
I hadnt never wanted to go till lately but hed of lammed me if I had of wanted to
He always said he would
And now I was too big and knowed it
Well Hank he never give me no money so I watches my chancet that afternoon and slips in under the tent the same as always
And I lays low under them green benches and wiggled through when I seen a good chancet
The first person I seen was Hank
Of course he seen me and he shook his fist at me in a promising kind of way and they wasnt no trouble figgering out what he meant
Fur a while I didnt enjoy that circus to no extent
Fur I was thinking that if Hank tries to lick me fur it Ill fight him back this time which I hadnt never fit him back much yet fur fear hed pick up something iron around the shop and jest natcherally lay me cold with it
I got home before Hank did
It was nigh sun down and I was waiting in the door of the shop fur Elmira to holler vittles is ready and Hank come along
He didnt waste no time
He steps inside the shop and he takes down a strap and he says You come here and take off your shirt
But I jest moves away
Hank he runs in on me and he swings his strap
I throwed up my arm and it cut me acrost the knuckles
I run in on him and he dropped the strap and fetched me an open handed smack plumb on the mouth that jarred my head back and like to of busted it loose
Then I got right mad and I run in on him agin and this time I got to him and wrastled with him
Well sir I never was so surprised in all my life before
Fur I hadnt had holt on him moren a minute before I seen Im stronger than Hank is
I throwed him and he hit the ground with con siderable of a jar and then I put my knee in the pit of his stomach and churned it a couple
And I thinks to myself what a fool I must of been fur bettern a year because I might of done this any time
I got him by the ears and I slammed his head into the gravel a few times him areaching fur my throat and apounding me with his fists but me ataking the licks and keeping holt
And I had a mighty contented time fur a few minutes there on top of Hank chuckling to myself and batting him one every now and then fur luck and trying to make him holler its enough
But Hank is stubborn and he wont holler
And purty soon I thinks what am I going to do
Fur Hank will be so mad when I let him up hell jest natcherally kill me without I kill him
And I was scared because I dont want neither one of them things to happen
Whilst I was thinking it over and getting scareder and scareder and banging Hanks head harder and harder some one grabs me from behind
They was two of them and one gets my collar and one gets the seat of my pants and they drug me offn him
Hank he gets up and then he sets down sudden on a horse block and wipes his face on his sleeve which they was considerable blood come onto the sleeve
I looks around to see who has had holt of me and it is two men
One of them looks about seven feet tall on account of a big plug hat and a long white linen duster and has a beautiful red beard
In the road they is a big stout road wagon with a canopy top over it pulled by two hosses and on the wagon box they is a strip of canvas
Which I couldnt read then what was wrote on the canvas but I learnt later it said in big print SIWASH INDIAN SAGRAW
NATURES UNIVERSAL MEDICINAL SPECIFIC
DISCOVERED BY DR HARTLEY L KIRBY AMONG THE ABORIGINES OF OREGON
On account of being so busy neither Hank nor me had hearn the wagon come along the road and stop
The big man in the plug hat he says or they was words to that effect jest as serious Why are you mauling the aged gent
Well says I he needed it considerable
But says he still more solemn the good book says to honour thy father and thy mother
Well I says mebby it does and mebby it dont
But HE aint my father nohow
And he aint been getting no moren his comeuppings
Vengeance is mine saith the Lord the big man remarks very serious
Hank he riz up then and he says Mister be you a preacher
Cause if you be the sooner you have druv on the better fur ye
I got a grudge agin all preachers
That feller he jest looks Hank over caam and easy and slow before he answers and he wrinkles up his face like he never seen anything like Hank before
Then he fetches a kind o aggervating smile and he says Beneath a shady chestnut tree The village blacksmith stands
The smith a pleasant soul is he With warts upon his hands He stares at Hank hard and solemn and serious while he is saying that poetry at him
Hank fidgets and turns his eyes away
But the feller touches him on the breast with his finger and makes him look at him
My honest friend says the feller I am NOT a preacher
Not right now anyhow
No
My mission is spreading the glad tidings of good health
Look at me and he swells his chest up and keeps aholt of Hanks eyes with hisn
You behold before you the discoverer manufacturer and proprietor of Siwash Indian Sagraw natures own remedy for Brights Disease rheumatism liver and kidney trouble catarrh consumption bronchitis ringworm erysipelas lung fever typhoid croup dandruff stomach trouble dyspepsia And they was a lot more of em
Well says Hank sort o backing up as the big man come nearer and nearer to him jest natcherally bullyragging him with them eyes I got none of them there complaints
The doctor he kind o snarls and he brings his hand down hard on Hanks shoulder and he says There are more things betwixt Dan and Beer sheba than was ever dreamt of in thy sagacity Romeo
Or they was words to that effect fur that doctor was jest plumb full of Scripter quota tions
And he sings out sudden giving Hank a shove that nearly pushes him over Man alive
he yells you DONT KNOW what disease you may have
Manys the strong man Ive seen rejoicing in his strength at the dawn of day cut down like the grass in the field before sunset he says
Hank hes trying to look the other way but that doctor wont let his eyes wiggle away from hisn
He says very sharp Stick out your tongue
Hank he sticks her out
The doctor he takes some glasses outn his pocket and puts em on and he fetches a long look at her
Then he opens his mouth like he was going to say something and shuts it agin like his feelings wont let him
He puts his arm across Hanks shoulder affectionate and sad and then he turns his head away like they was some one dead in the fambly
Finally he says I thought so
I saw it
I saw it in your eyes when I first drove up
I hope he says very mournful I havent come too late
Hank he turns pale
I was getting sorry fur Hank myself
I seen now why I licked him so easy
Any one could of told from that doctors actions Hank was as good as a dead man already
But Hank he makes a big effort and he says Shucks
Im sixtyeight years old doctor and I haint never had a sick day in my life
But he was awful uneasy too
The doctor he says to the feller with him Looey bring me one of the sample size
Looey brung it the doctor never taking his eyes offn Hank
He handed it to Hank and he says A whiskey glass full three times a day my friend and there is a good chance for even you
I give it to you without money and without price
But what have I got
asts Hank
You have spinal meningitis says the doctor never batting an eye
Will this here cure me
says Hank
Itll cure ANYTHING says the doctor
Hank he says Shucks agin but he took the bottle and pulled the cork out and smelt it right thoughtful
And what them fellers had stopped at our place fur was to have the shoe of the nigh hosss off hind foot nailed on which it was most ready to drop off
Hank he done it fur a regula tion dollarsize bottle and they druv on into the village
Right after supper I goes down town
They was in front of Smiths Palace Hotel
They was jest starting up when I got there
Well sir that doctor was a sight
He didnt have his duster onto him but his stovepipe hat was and one of them long Prince Alferd coats nearly to his knees and shiny shoes but his vest was cut out holler fur to show his biled shirt and it was the pinkest shirt I ever see and in the middle of that they was a dia mond as big as Uncle Pat Hickeys wen what was one of the town sights
No sir they never was a man with more genuine fashionableness sticking out all over him than Doctor Kirby
He jest fairly wallered in it
I hadnt paid no perticler attention to the other feller with him when they stopped at our place excepting to notice he was kind of slim and black haired and funny complected
But I seen now I orter of looked closeter
Fur Ill be dadbinged if he werent an Injun
There he set under that there gasoline lamp the wagon was all lit up with with moccasins on and beads and shells all over him and the gaudiest turkey tail of feathers rain bowing down from his head you ever see and a blanket around him that was gaudier than the feathers
And he shined and rattled every time he moved
That wagon was a hull opry house to itself
It was rolled out in front of Smiths Palace Hotel without the hosses
The front part was filled with bottles of medicine
The doctor he begun business by taking out a long brass horn and tooting on it
They was about a dozen come but they was mostly boys
Then him and the Injun picked up some banjoes and sung a comic song out loud and clear
And they was another dozen or so come
And they sung another song and Pop Wilkins he closed up the postoffice and come over and the other two veterans of the Grand Army of the Republicans that always plays checkers in there nights come along with him
But it wasnt much of a crowd and the doctor he looked sort o worried
I had a good place right near the hind wheel of the wagon where he rested his foot occasional and I seen what he was thinking
So I says to him Doctor Kirby I guess the crowd is all gone to the circus agin tonight
And all them fellers there seen I knowed him
I guess so Rube he says to me
And they all laughed cause he called me Rube and I felt kind of took down
Then he lit in to tell about that Injun medicine
First off he told how he come to find out about it
It was the father of the Injun what was with him had showed him he said
And it was in the days of his youthfulness when he was wild and a cowboy on the plains of Oregon
Well one night he says they was an awful fight on the plains of Oregon wherever them is and he got plugged full of bullet holes
And his hoss run away with him and he was carried off and the hoss was going at a dead run and the blood was running down onto the ground
And the wolves smelt the blood and took out after him yipping and yowling something frightful to hear and the hoss he kicked out be hind and killed the head wolf and the others stopped to eat him up and while they was eating him the hoss gained a quarter of a mile
But they et him up and they was gaining agin fur the smell of human blood was on the plains of Oregon he says and the sight of his mothers face when she ast him never to be a cowboy come to him in the moonlight and he knowed that somehow all would yet be well and then he must of fainted and he knowed no more till he woke up in a tent on the plains of Oregon
And they was an old Injun bending over him and a beautiful Injun maiden was feeling of his pulse and they says to him Pale face take hope fur we will doctor you with Siwash Injun Sagraw which is natures own cure fur all diseases
They done it
And he got well
It had been a secret among them there Injuns fur thousands and thousands of years
Any Injun that give away the secret was killed and rubbed off the rolls of the tribe and buried in disgrace upon the plains of Oregon
And the doctor was made a blood brother of the chief and learnt the secret of that medicine
Finally he got the chief to see as it wasnt Christian to hold back that there medicine from the world no longer and the chief his heart was softened and he says to go
Go my brother he says and give to the pale faces the medicine that has been kept secret fur thousands and thousands of years among the Siwash Injuns on the plains of Oregon
And he went
It wasnt that he wanted to make no money out of that there medicine
He could of made all the money he wanted being a doctor in the reglar way
But what he wanted was to spread the glad tidings of good health all over this fair land of ourn he says
Well sir he was a talker that there doctor was and he knowed more religious sayings and poetry along with it than any feller I ever hearn
He goes on and he tells how awful sick people can manage to get and never know it and no one else never suspicion it and live along fur years and years thataway and all the time in danger of death
He says it makes him weep when he sees them poor diluted fools going around and thinking they is well men talking and laughing and marrying and giving in to marriage right on the edge of the grave
He sees dozens of em in every town he comes to
But they cant fool him he says
He can tell at a glance whos got Brights Disease in their kidneys and who aint
His own father he says was deathly sick fur years and years and never knowed it and the knowledge come on him sudden like and he died
That was before Siwash Injun Sagraw was ever found out about
Doctor Kirby broke down and cried right there in the wagon when he thought of how his father might of been saved if he was only alive now that that medicine was put up into bottle form six fur a fivedollar bill so long as he was in town and after that two dollars fur each bottle at the drug store
He unrolled a big chart and the Injun helt it by that there gasoline lamp so all could see turning the pages now and then
It was a map of a mans inside organs and digestive ornaments and things
They was red and blue like each organs own disease had turned it and some of em was yaller
And they was a long string of diseases printed in black hanging down from each organs picture
I never knowed before they was so many diseases nor yet so many things to have em in
Well I was feeling purty good when that show started
But the doc he kep looking right at me every now and then when he talked and I couldnt keep my eyes offn him
Does your heart beat fast when you exercise
he asts the crowd
Is your tongue coated after meals
Do your eyes leak when your nose is stopped up
Do you perspire under your arm pits
Do you ever have a ringing in your ears
Does your stomach hurt you after meals
Does your back ever ache
Do you ever have pains in your legs
Do your eyes blur when you look at the sun
Are your teeth coated
Does your hair come out when you comb it
Is your breath short when you walk up stairs
Do your feet swell in warm weather
Are there white spots on your finger nails
Do you draw your breath part of the time through one nostril and part of the time through the other
Do you ever have nightmare
Did your nose bleed easily when you were growing up
Does your skin fester when scratched
Are your eyes gummy in the mornings
Then he says if you have any or all of these symptoms your blood is bad and your liver is wasting away
Well sir I seen I was in a bad way fur at one time or another I had had most of them there signs and warnings and hadnt heeded em and I had some of em yet
I begun to feel kind o sick and looking at them organs and diseases didnt help me none either
The doctor he lit out on another string of symptoms and I had them too
Seems to me I had purty nigh everything but fits
Kidney complaint and consumption both had a holt on me
It was about a even bet which would get me first
I kind o got to wondering which
I figgered from what he said that Id had consumption the LONGEST while but my kind of kidney trouble was an awful SLY kind and it was lible to jump in without no warning atall and jest natcherally wipe me out QUICK
So I sort o bet on the kidney trouble
But I seen I was a goner and I forgive Hank all his orneriness fur a feller dont want to die holding grudges
Taking it the hull way through that was about the best medicine show I ever seen
But they didnt sell much
All the people what had any money was to the circus agin that night
So they sung some more songs and closed early and went into the hotel
CHAPTER IV Well the next morning Im feeling con siderable better and think mebby Im go ing to live after all
I got up earliern Hank did and slipped out without him seeing me and didnt go nigh the shop atall
Fur now Ive licked Hank oncet I figger he wont rest till he has wiped that disgrace out and he wont care a dern what he picks up to do it with nuther
They was a crick about a hundred yards from our house in the woods and I went over there and laid down and watched it run by
I laid awful still thinking I wisht I was away from that town
Purty soon a squirrel comes down and sets on a log and watches me
I throwed an acorn at him and he scooted up a tree quickern scatt
And then I wisht I hadnt scared him away fur it looked like he knowed I was in trouble
Purty soon I takes a swim and comes out and lays there some more spitting into the water and thinking what shall I do now and watching birds and things mov ing around and ants working hardern ever I would agin unless I got better pray fur it and these here tumble bugs kicking their loads along hind end to
After a while it is getting along toward noon and Im feeling hungry
But I dont want to have no more trouble with Hank and I jest lays there
I hearn two men coming through the underbrush
I riz up on my elbow to look and one of them was Doctor Kirby and the other was Looey only Looey wasnt an Injun this morning
They sets down on the roots of a big tree a little ways off with their backs toward me and they aint seen me
So nacherally I listened to what they was jawing about
They was both kind o mad at the hull world and at our town in perticler and some at each other too
The doctor he says I havent had such rotten luck since I played the bloodhound in a Tom ShowWere you ever an Uncle Toms Cabin artist Looeyand a justice of the peace over in Iowa fined me five dollars for being on the street without a muzzle
Said it was a city ordinance
Talk about the gentle Rube being an easy mark
If these country towns dont get the wandering minstrels money one way they will another
Its your own fault says Looey kind o sour
I cant see it says Doctor Kirby
How did I know that all these appleknockers had been filled up with Sykess Magic Remedy only two weeks ago
I may have been a spiritualistic medium in my time now and then he says and a mind reader too but Im no prophet
I aint talking about the business Doc and you know it says Looey
Wed be all right and have our horses and wagon now if youd only stuck to business and not got us into that poker game
Talk about suckers
Doc for a man that has skinned as many of em as you have youre the worst sucker yourself I ever saw
The doctor he cusses the poker game and country towns and medicine shows and the hull creation and says he is so disgusted with life he guesses hell go and be a preacher or a bearded lady in a side show
But Looey he dont cheer up none
He says All right Doc but its no use talking
You can TALK all right
We all know that
The ques tion is how are we going to get our horses and wagon away from these Rubes
I listens some more and I seen them fellers was really into bad trouble
Doctor Kirby he had got into a poker game at Smiths Palace Hotel the night before right after the show
He had won from Jake Smith which run it and from the others
But shucks
it never made no difference what you won in that crowd
They had done Doctor Kirby and Looey like they always done a drummer or a stranger that come along to that town and was fool enough to play poker with them
They wasnt a chancet fur an outsider
If the drummer lost they would take his money and that would be all they was to it
But if the drummer got to winning good some one would slip outn the hotel and tell Si Emery which was the city marshal
And Si would get Ralph Scott that worked fur Jake Smith in his livery stable and pin a star onto Ralph too
And they would be arrested fur gambling only them that lived in our town would get away
Which Si and Ralph was always scared every time they done it
Then the drummer or whoever it was would be took to the calaboose and spend all night there
In the morning they would be took before Squire Matthews that was justice of the peace
They would be fined a big fine and he would get all the drummer had won and all he had brung to town with him besides
Squire Matthews and Jake Smith and Windy Goodell and Mart Watson which the two last was lawyers was always playing that there game on drummers that was fool enough to play poker
Hank he says he bet they divided it up afterward though it was supposed them fines went to the town
Well they played a purty closte game of poker in our little town
It was jest like the doctor says to Looey By George he says it is a wellnigh perfect thing
If you lose you lose and if you win you lose
Well the doctor he had started out winning the night before
And Si Emery and Ralph Scott had arrested them
And that morning while I had been laying by the crick and the rest of the town was seeing the fun they had been took afore Squire Matthews and fined one hundred and twentyfive dollars apiece
The doctor he tells Squire Mat thews it is an outrage and it aint legal if tried in a bigger court and they aint that much money in the world so fur as he knows and he wont pay it
But the squire he says the time has come to teach them travelling fakirs as is always running around the country with shows and electric belts and things that they got to stop dreening that town of hardearned money and he has decided to make an example of em
The only two lawyers in town is Windy and Mart which has been in the poker game theirselves the same as always
The doctor says the hull thing is a putup job and he cant get the money and he wouldnt if he could and hell lay in that town calaboose and rot the rest of his life and eat the town poor before hell stand it
And the squire says hell jest take their hosses and wagon fur clatteral till they make up the rest of the two hundred and fifty dollars
And the hosses and wagon was now in the livery stable next to Smiths Palace Hotel which Jake run that too
Well I thinks to myself it IS a dern shame and I felt sorry fur them two fellers
Fur our town was jest as good as stealing that property
And I felt kind o shamed of belonging to such a town too
And I thinks to myself Id like to help em out of that scrape
And then I seen how I could do it and not get took up fur it neither
So without thinking all of a sudden I jumps up and says Say Doctor Kirby I got a scheme
They jumps up too and they looks at me startled
Then the doctor kind o laughs and says Why its the young blacksmith
Looey he says looking at me hard and suspicious What kind of a scheme are you talking about
Why says I to get that outfit of yourn
Youve been listening to us says Looey
Looey was one of them quietlooking fellers that never laughed much nor talked much
Looey he never made fun of nobody which the doctor was always doing and I wouldnt of cared to make fun of Looey much either
Yes I says I been laying here fur quite a spell and quite natcheral I listened to you as any one else would of done
And mebby I can get that team and wagon of yourn without it costing you a cent
Well they didnt know what to say
They asts me how but I says to leave it all to me
Walk right along down this here crick I says till you get to where it comes outn the woods and runs acrost the road in under an iron bridge
Thats about a half a mile east
Jest after the road crosses the bridge it forks
Take the right fork and walk another half a mile and youll see a little yaller painted schoolhouse setting lonesome on a sand hill
They aint no school in it now
You wait there fur me I says fur a couple of hours
After that if I aint there youll know I cant make it
But I think Ill make it
They looks at each other and they looks at me and then they go off a little piece and talk low and then the doctor says to me Rube he says I dont know how you can work anything on us that hasnt been worked already
Weve got nothing more we can lose
You go to it Rube
And they started off
So I went over town
Jake Smith was setting on the piazza in front of his hotel chawing and spitting tobacco with his feet agin the railing like he always done and one of his eyes squinched up and his hat over the other one
Jake I says wheres that there doctor
Jake he spit careful afore he answered and he pulled his long scraggly moustache careful and he squinched his eyes at me
Jake was a careful man in everything he done
I dunno Danny he says
Why
Well I says Hank sent me over to get that wagon and them hosses of theirn and finish that job
That there wagon says Jake is in my barn with Si Emery watching her and she has got to stay there till the law lets her loose
I figgered to myself Jake could use that team and wagon in his business and was going to buy her cheap offn the town what share of her he didnt figger he owned already
Why Jake I says I hope they aint been no trouble of no kind that has drug the law into your barn
Well Danny he says they HAS been a little trouble
But its about over now I guess
And that there outfit belongs to the town now
You dont say so
says I surprisedlike
When I seen them men last night it looked to me like they was too fine dressed to be honest
I dont think they be Danny says Jake confidential
In my opinion they is mighty bad customers
But they has got on the wrong side of the law now and I guess they wont stay around here much longer
Well says I Hank will be glad
Fur what
asts Jake
Well says I because he got his pay in advance fur that job and now he dont have to finish it
They come along to our place about sundown yesterday and we nailed a shoe on one hoss
They was a couple of other hoofs needed fixing and the tire on one of the hind wheels was beginning to rattle loose
I had noticed that loose tire when I was standing by the hind wheel the night before and it come in handy now
So I goes on Hank he allowed hed fix the hull thing fur six bottles of that Injun medicine
Elmira has been ailing lately and he wanted it fur her
So they handed Hank out six bottles then and there
Huh
says Jake
So the job is all paid fur is it
Yes says I and I was expecting to do it myself
But now I guess Ill go fishing instead
They aint no other job in the shop
Ill be dinged if youve got time to fish says Jake
Im expecting mebby to buy that rig off the town myself when the law lets loose of it
So if the fixing is paid fur I want everything fixed
Jake says I kind of worried like I dont want to do it without that doctor says to go ahead
They aint hisn no longer says Jake
I dunno says I as you got any right to make me do it Jake
It dont look to me like its no harm to beat a couple of fellers like them out of their medicine
And I DID want to go fishing this afternoon
But Jake was that careful and stingy hed try to skin a hoss twicet if it died
Hes bound to get that job done now
Danny he says you gotto do that work
It aint HONEST not to
What a young feller like you jest starting out into life wants to remember is to always be honest
Then says Jake squinch ing up his eyes people trusts you and you get a good chancet to make money
Look at this here hotel and livery stable Danny
Twenty years ago I didnt have no moren youve got Danny
But I always went by them mottoeshard work and being honest
You GOTTO nail them shoes on Danny and fix that wheel
Well all right Jake says I if you feel that way about it
Jest give me a chaw of tobacco and come around and help me hitch em up
Si Emery was there asleep on a pile of straw guarding that property
But Ralph Scott wasnt around
Si didnt wake up till we had hitched em up
He says he will ride around to the shop with me
But Jake says Its all right Si
Ill go over myself and fetch em back purty soon
Which Si was wore out with being up so late the night before and goes back to sleep agin right off
Well sir they wasnt nothing went wrong
I drove slow through the village and past our shop
Hank come to the door of it as I went past
But I hit them hosses a lick and they broke into a right smart trot
Elmira she come onto the porch and I waved my hand at her
She put her hand up to her forehead to shut out the sun and jest stared
She didnt know I was waving her farewell
Hank he yelled something at me but I never hearn what
I licked them hosses into a gallop and went around the turn of the road
And thats the last I ever seen or hearn of Hank or Elmira or that there little town
CHAPTER V I slowed down when I got to the school house and both them fellers piled in
I guess I better turn north fur about a mile and then turn west Doctor Kirby I says so as to make a kind of a circle around that town
Why so Rube
he asts me
Well I says we left it going east and theyll foller us east so dont we want to be going west while theyre follering east
Looey he agreed with me
But he said it wouldnt be much use fur we would likely be ketched up with and took back and hung or some thing anyhow
Looey could get the lowest in his sperrits sometimes of any man I ever seen
Dont be afraid of that says the doctor
They are not going to follow us
THEY know they didnt get this property by due process of law
THEY arent going to take the case into a county court where it will all come out about the way they robbed a couple of travelling men with a fake trial
I guess you know more about the lawn I do I says
I kind o thought mebby we stole them hosses
Well he says we got em anyhow
And if they try to arrest us without a warrant therell be the deuce to pay
But they arent going to make any more trouble
I know these country crooks
Theyve got no stomach for trouble out side their own township
Which made me feel considerable better fur I never been of the opinion that going agin the law done any one no good
They looks around in that wagon and all their stuff was thereJake Smith and the squire hav ing kep it all together careful to make things seem more legal I supposeand the doctor was plumb tickled and Looey felt as cheerful as he ever felt about anything
So the doctor says they has every thing they needs but some ready money and hell get that sure fur he never seen the time he couldnt
But Looey he says Im done with country hotels from now on
Theyve got the last cent they ever will from meat least in the summer time
How you going to work it
Looey asts him like he hasnt no hopes it will work right
Camp out says the doctor
Ive been think ing it all over
Then he turns to me
Rube he says where are you going
Well I says I aint pinted nowhere in per ticler except away from that town we just left
Which my name aint Rube Doctor Kirby but Danny
Danny what
asts he
Nothing says I jest Danny
Well then Danny says he how would you like to be an Indian
Medical
asts I or real
Like Looey says he
I tells him being a medical Injun and mixed up with a show like hisn would suit me down to the ground and asts him what is the main duties of one besides the blankets and the feathers
Well he says this campingout scheme of mine will take a couple of Indians
Instead of pay ing hotel and feed bills well pitch our tent he says at the edge of town in each sweet Auburn of the plains
Well save money and well be near the throbbing heart of nature
And an Indian camp in each place will be a good advertisement for the Sagraw
You can look after the horses and learn to do the cooking and that kind o thing
And maybe after while he says kind o working him self up to where he thought it was going to be real nice maybe after while I will give you some in sight into the hidden mysteries of selling Siwash Indian Sagraw
Well says I Id like to learn that
Would you
says he kind o laughing at him self and me too and yet kind o enthusiastic well then the first thing you have to do is learn how to sell corn salve
Any one that can sell corn salve can sell anything
Theres a farmhouse right over there and Ill give you your first lesson right now
Rummage around in that satchel there under the seat and get me a tin box and some corn salve labels
I found a lot of labels and some boxes too
The labels was all different sizes but barring that they all looked about the same to me
Whilst I was sizing them up he asts me agin was they any corn salve ones in there
What colour label is it Doctor Kirby
I asts him
Fur they was blue labels and white labels and pink labels
He looks at me right queer
Cant you read the labels
he says right sharp
Well I says I never been much of a reader when it comes to different kind of medicines
Corn salve is spelled only one way says he
Thats right I says and youd think I orter be able to pick out a common ordinary thing like corn salve right off wouldnt you
Danny he says you dont mean to tell me you cant read anything at all
I never told you nothing of the kind
He picks out a label
If you can read so fast whats that
he asts
She is a pink one
I thinks to myself she either is corn salve or else she aint corn salve
And it aint natcheral he will pick corn salve fur he would think I would say that first off
So Im betting it aint
I takes a chancet on it
That says I is mighty easy reading
That is Siwash Injun Sagraw
I lost
Its corn salve he says
And Great Scott
They call this the twentieth century
I never called it that says I sort o madlike
Fur I was feeling bad Doctor Kirby had found out I was such a ignoramus
Where ignorance is bliss says he it is folly to be wise
But all the same Im going to take your education in hand and make you drink of lifes Peruvian springs
Or some spring like that it was
And the doctor he done it
Looey said it wouldnt be no use learning to read
Hed done a lot of reading he said and it never helped him none
All he ever read showed him this feller Hamlet was right he said when he wrote Shakespeares works and they wasnt much use in anything without you had a lot o money
And they wasnt no chancet to get that with all these here trusts around gobbling up everything and stomping the poor man into the dirt and they was lots of times he wisht he was a Injun sure enough and not jest a medical one fur then hed be a free man and the bosses and the trusts and the railroads and the robber tariff couldnt touch him
And then he shut up and didnt say nothing fur a hull hour except oncet he laughed
Fur Doctor Kirby he says winking at me Looey here is a nihilist
Is he says I whats that
And the doctor tells me about how they blow up dukes and czars and them foreign highmuckymucks with dynamite
Which is when Looey laughed
Well we jogged along at a pretty good gait fur several hours and we stayed that night at a Swedes place which the doctor paid him fur everything in medicine only it took a long time to make the bar gain fur them Swedes is always careful not to get cheated and hasnt many diseases
And the next night we showed in a little town and done right well and took in considerable money
We stayed there three days and bought a tent and a sheetiron stove and some skillets and things and some provisions and a suit of duds for me
Well we went on and we kept going on and they was bully times
Wed ease up careful toward a town and pick us out a place on the edge where the hosses could graze along the side of the road and most ginerally by a piece of woods not fur from that town and nigh a crick if we could
Then wed set up our tent
After we had everything fixed Id put on my Injun clothes and Looey hisn and wed drive through the main store street of the town at a purty good lick me aholt of the reins and the doctor all togged out in his best clothes and Looey doing a Injun dance in the midst of the wagon
Id pull up the hosses sudden in front of the postoffice or the depot platform or the hotel and the people would come crowding around and the doctor hed make a little talk from the wagon and tell everybody they would be a free show that night on that corner and fur everybody to come to it
And then wed drive back to camp lickity split
Purty soon every boy in town would be out there kind o hanging around to see what a Injun camp was like
And the farmers that went into and out of town always stopped and passed the time of day and the Injun camp got the hull town all worked up as a usual thing and the doctor he done well fur when night come every one would be on hand
Looey and me every time we went into town had on our Injun suits and the doctor he wondered why he hadnt never thought up that scheme before
Sometimes when they was lots of people ailing in a town and they hadnt been no show fur quite a while wed stay five or six days and make a good cleanup
The doctor he sent to Chicago several times fur alcohol in barrels cause he was selling it so fast he had to make new Sagraw
And he had to get more and more bottles and a hull satchel full of new Sagraw labels printed
And all the time the doctor was learning me edu cation
And shucks
they wasnt nothing so hard about it oncet youd got started in to reading things
I jest natcherally took to print like a duck to water and inside of a month I was reading nigh every thing that has ever been wrote
He had lots of books with him and every time a new sockdologer of a word come along and I learnt how to spell her and where she orter fit in to make sense it kind o tickled me all over
And manys the time afterward when me and the doctor had lost track of each other and they was quite a spell people got to thinking I was a tramp Ive went into these here Andrew Carnegie libraries in different towns jest as much to see if they had anything fitten to read as fur to keep warm
Well we went easing over toward the Indiany line and we was having a purty good time
They wasnt no work to do you could call really hard and they was plenty of vittles
Afternoons wed lazy around the camp and swap stories and make medicine if we needed a batch and josh back and forth with the people that hung around and loaf and doze and smoke or mebby do a little fishing if we was nigh a crick
And nights after the show was over it was fun too
We always had a fire even if it was a hot night fur to cook by in the first place and fur to keep mosquitoes off and to make things seem more cheerful
They aint nothing so good as hanging round a campfire
And they aint nothing any better than sleeping outdoors neither
You roll up in your blanket with your feet to the fire and you get to wondering things about things afore you go to sleep
The silentness jest natcherally swamps everything after a while and then all them queer little noises you never hear in the daytime comes popping and poking through the silentness or kind o scratching their way through it sometimes and makes it kind o feel more silent than ever
And if you are nigh a crick purty soon it will sort of get to talking to you only you cant make out what its trying to say and you get to wondering about that too
And if you are in a tent and it rains and the tent dont leak that rain is a kind of a nice thing to listen to itself
But if you can see the stars you get to wondering moren ever
They come out and they is so many of them and they are so fur away and yet they are so kind o friendly like too if you happen to be feeling purty good
But if you aint feeling purty good jest lay there and look at them stars long enough and then mebby youll see it dont make no difference whether youre feeling good or not fur they got a way o making your private troubles look mighty small
And you get to wondering why that is too fur they aint human and it dont stand to reason you orter pay no attention to them one way nor the other
They is jest there like trees and cricks and hills
But I have often noticed that the things that is jest there has got a way of seeming more friendly than the things that has been built and put there
You can look at a big iron bridge or a grain elevator or a canal all day long and if youre feeling blue it dont help you none
It was jest put there
Or a hay stack is the same way
But you go and lazy around in the grass when youre down on your luck and kind o make remarks to a crick or a big old walnut tree and before long it gets you to feeling like it didnt make no difference how you felt anyhow fur you dont amount to nothing by the side of something that was always there
You get to thinking how the hull world itself was always here and you sort o see they aint nothing im portant enough about yourself to worry about and presently you will go to sleep and forget it
The doctor says to me one time them stars aint any different from this world and this is one of them
Which is a fool idea as any one can see
He had a lot of queer ideas like that Doctor Kirby had
But they aint nothing like sleeping out of doors nights to make you wonder the kind of wonderings you never will get any answer to
Well I never cared so much fur houses after them days
They was bully times them was
And I was kind of proud of being with a show too
Manys the time I have went down the street in that there Injun suit and seen how the young fellers would of give all they owned to be me
And every now and then you would hear one say when you went past Huh I know him
Thats one of them show fellers
One afternoon we pitches our tent right on the edge of a little town called Athens
We was nigh the bank of a crick and they was a grove there
We was camped jest outside of a woodlot fence and back in through the trees from us they was a house with a hedge fence all around it
They was apple trees and all kind of flower bushes and things inside of the hedge
The second day we was there I takes a walk back through the woodlot and along past the house and they was one of these here early harvest apple trees spilling apples through a gap in the fence
Them is a mighty sweet and juicy kind of apple and I picks one up and bites into it
I think you might have asked for it says some one
CHAPTER VI I looks up and that was how I got ac quainted with Martha
She was eating one herself setting up in the tree like a boy
In her lap was a book she had been reading
She was leaning back into the fork two limbs made so as not to tumble
Well I says can I have one
Youve eaten it already she says so there isnt any use begging for it now
I seen she was a tease that girl and I would of give anything to of been able to tease her right back agin
But I couldnt think of nothing to say so I jest stands there kind o dumb like thinking what a dern purty girl she was and thinking how dumb I must look and I felt my face getting red
Doctor Kirby would of thought of something to say right off
And after I got back to camp I would think of something myself
But I couldnt think of nothing bright so I says Well then you give me another one
She gives the core of the one she has been eating a toss at me
But I ketched it and made like I was going to throw it back at her real hard
She slung up her arm and dodged back and she dropped her book
I thinks to myself Ill learn that girl to get sassy and make me feel like a dumbhead even if she is purty
So I dont say a word
I jest picks up that book and sticks it under my arm and walks away slow with it to where they was a stump a little ways off not fur from the crick and sets down with my back to her and opens it
And I was trying all the time to think of something smart to say to her
But I couldnt of done it if I was to be shot
Still I thinks to myself no girl can sass me and not get sassed back neither
I hearn a scramble behind me which I knowed was her getting out of that tree
And in a minute she was in front of me mad
Give me my book she says
But I only reads the name of the book out loud fur to aggervate her
I had on purty good duds but I kind of wisht I had on my Injun rig then
You take the girls that always comes down to see the passenger train come into the depot in them country towns and that Injun rig of mine and Looeys always made em turn around and look at us agin
I never wisht I had on them Injun duds so hard before in my life
But I couldnt think of nothing bright to say so I jest reads the name of that book over to myself agin kind o grinning like I got a good joke I aint going to tell any one
You give me my book she says agin red as one of them harvest apples or Ill tell Miss Hamp ton you stole it and shell have you and your show arrested
I reads the name agin
It was The Lost Heir
I seen I had her good and teased now so I says It must be one of these here love stories by the way you take on over it
Its not she says getting ready to cry
And what right have you got in our woodlot anyhow
Well I says I was jest about to move on and climb out of it when you hollered to me from that tree
I didnt
she says
But she was mad because she knowed she HAD spoke to me first and she was awful sorry she had
I thought I hearn you holler I says but I guess it must of been a squirrel
I said it kind o sarcastic like fur I was still mad with myself fur being so dumb when we first seen each other
I hadnt no idea it would hurt her feelings as hard as it did
But all of a sudden she begins to wink and her chin trembled and she turned around short and started to walk off slow
She was mad with herself fur being ketched in a lie and she was wondering what I would think of her fur being so bold as to of spoke first to a feller she didnt know
I got up and follered her a little piece
And it come to me all to oncet I had teased her too hard and I was down on myself fur it
Say I says kind of tagging along beside of her heres your old book
But she didnt make no move to take it and her hands was over her face and she wouldnt pull em down to even look at it
So I tried agin
Well I says feeling real mean I wisht you wouldnt cry
I didnt go to make you do that
She drops her hands and whirls around on me mad as a wet hen right off
Im not
Im not
she sings out and stamps her feet
Im not crying
But jest then she loses her holt on herself and busts out and jest natcherally bellers
I hate you
she says like she could of killed me
That made me kind of dumb agin
Fur it come to me all to oncet I liked that girl awful well
And here Id up and made her hate me
I held the book out to her agin and says Well Im mighty sorry fur that fur I dont feel thataway about you atall
Heres your book
Well sir she snatches that book and she gives it a sling
I thought it was going kersplash into the crick
But it didnt
It hit right into the fork of a limb that hung down over the crick and it all spread out when it lit and stuck in that crotch somehow
She couldnt of slung it that way on purpose in a million years
We both stands and looks at it a minute
Oh oh
she says what have I done
Its out of the town library and Ill have to pay for it
Ill get it fur you I says
But it wasnt no easy job
If I shook that limb it would tumble into the crick
But I clumb the tree and eased out on that limb as fur as I dast to
And of course jest as I got holt of the book that limb broke and I fell into the crick
But I had the book
It was some soaked but I reckoned it could still be read
I clumb out and she was jest splitting herself laughing at me
The wet on her face where she had cried wasnt dried up yet and she was laughing right through it kind o like the sun does to one of these here May rainstorms sometimes and she was the purtiest girl I ever seen
Goshhow I was getting to like that girl
And she told me I looked like a drowned rat
Well that was how Martha and me was inter duced
She wasnt moren sixteen and when she found out I was a orphan she was glad fur she was one herself
Which Miss Hampton that lived in that house had took her to raise
And when I tells her how I been travelling around the country all summer she claps her hands and she says Oh you are on a quest
How romantic
I asts her what is a quest
And she tells me
She knowed all about them fur Martha was con siderable of a reader
Some of them was longer and some of them was shorter them quests but mostly Martha says they was fur a twelvemonth and a day
And then you are released from your vow and one of these here queens gives you a whack over the shoulder with a sword and says Arise Sir Marmeluke I dub you a night
And then it is legal fur you to go out and rescue people and reform them and spear them if they dont see things your way and come between husband and wife when they row and do a heap of good in the world
Well they was other kind of quests too but mostly you married somebody or was dubbed a night or found the party you was looking fur in the end
And Martha had it all fixed up in her own mind I was in a quest to find my father
Fur says she he is purty certain to be a powerful rich man and moren likely a earl
The way I was found Martha says kind o pints to the idea they was a earl mixed up in it somewhere
She had read a lot about earls and knew their ways
Mebby my mother was a earls daughter
Earls daughters is the worst fur leaving you out in baskets going by what Martha said
It is a kind of a habit with them fur they is awful proud people
But it was a lucky way to start life from all she said that basket way
There was Moses was left out that way and when he growed up he was made a kind of a president of the hull human race the same as Ruzevelt and figgered out the twelve commandments
Martha would of give anything if she could of only been found in a basket like me I could see that
But she wasnt
She had jest been left a orphan when her folks died
They wasnt even no hopes she had been changed at birth fur another one
But I seen down in under everything Martha kind o thought mebby one of them nights might come aprancing along and wed her in spite of herself or she would be carried off or something
She was a very romanceful kind of girl
When I seen she had it figgered out I was in a quest fur some highmuckymuck fur a dad I didnt tell her no different
I didnt take much stock in them earls and nights myself
So fur as I could see they was all furriners of one kind or another
But that thing of being into a quest kind of interested me too
How would I know him if I was to run acrost him
I asts her
You would feel an Intangible Something she says drawing you toward him
I asts her what kind of a something
I make out from what she says it is some like these fellers that can find water with a piece of witch hazel switch
You take a switch of it between your thumbs and point it up
Then you shut your eyes and walk backwards
When you get over where the water is the witch hazel stick twists around and points to the ground
You dig there and you get a good well
Nobody knows jest why that stick is drawed to the ground
It is like one of these little whirly gig compasses is drawed to the north
It is the same Martha says if you is on a quest fur a father or a mother only you have got to be worthy of that there quest she says
The first time you meet the right one you are drawed jest like the witch hazel
That is the Intangible Something working on you she says
Martha had learnt a lot about that
The book that had fell in the crick was like that
She lent it to me
Well that all sounded kind of reasonable to me
I seen that witch hazel work myself
Old Blindy Wolfe whose eyes had been dead fur so many years they had turned plumb white had that gift and picked out all the places fur wells that was dug in our neighbourhood at home
And I makes up my mind I will watch out fur that feeling of being drawed wherever I goes after this
You cant tell what will come of them kind of things
So purty soon Martha has to milk the cow and I goes along back to camp thinking about that quest and about what a purty girl she is which we had set there talking so long it was nigh sundown and my clothes had dried onto me
When I got over to camp I seen they must be something wrong
Looey was setting in the grass under the wagon looking kind of sour and kind of worried and watching the doctor
The doctor was jest inside the tent and he was looking queer too and not cheerful which he was usually
The doctor looks at me like he dont skeercly know me
Which he dont
He has one of them quiet kind of drunks on
Which Looey explains is bound to come every so often
He dont do nothing mean but jest gets lowsperrited and wont talk to no one
Then all of a sudden he will go down town and walk up and down the main streets orderly but looking hard into peoples faces mostly womens faces
Oncet Looey says they was big trouble over it
They was in a store in a goodsized town and he took hold of a womans chin and tilted her face back and looked at her hard and most scared her to death and they was nearly being a riot there
And he was jailed and had to pay a big fine
Since then Looey always follers him around when he is thataway
Well that night Doctor Kirby is too fur gone fur us to have our show
He jest sets and stares and stares at the fire and his eyes looks like they is another fire inside of his head and he is hurting outside and in
Looey and me watches him from the shadders fur a long time before we turns in and the last thing I seen before I went to sleep was him setting there with his face in his hands staring and his lips moving now and then like he was talking to himself
The next day he is asleep all morning
But that day he dont drink any more and Looey says mebby it aint going to be one of the reglar pifflicated kind
I seen Martha agin that day tootwicet I has talks with her
I told her about the doctor
Is he into a quest do you think
I asts her
She says she thinks it is remorse fur some crime he has done
But I couldnt figger Doctor Kirby would of done none
So that night after the show I says to him innocentlike Doctor Kirby what is a quest
He looks at me kind of queer
Wherefore says he this sudden thirst for enlightenment
I jest run acrost the word accidentallike I told him
He looks at me awful hard his eyes jest natcherally digging into me
I felt like he knowed I had set out to pump him
I wisht I hadnt tried it
Then he tells me a quest is a hunt
And Im glad thats over with
But it aint
Fur purty soon he says Danny did you ever hear of Lady Clara Vere de Vere
No I says who is she
A lady friend of Lord Tennysons he says whose manners were above reproach
Well I says she sounds kind of like a medi cine to me
Lady Clara he says and all the other Vere de Veres were people with manners we should try to imitate
If Lady Clara had been here last night when I was talking to myself Danny her manners wouldnt have let her listen to what I was talking about
I didnt listen
I says
Fur I seen what he was driving at now with them Vere de Veres
He thought I had ast him what a quest was because he was on one
I was certain of that now
He wasnt quite sure what he had been talking about and he wanted to see how much I had hearn
I thinks to myself it must be a awful funny kind of hunt he is on if he only hunts when he is in that fix
But I acted real innocent and like my feelings was hurt and he believed me
Purty soon he says cheerful like There was a girl talking to you today Danny
Mebby they was I says and mebby they wasnt
But I felt my face getting red all the same and was mad because it did
He grinned kind of aggervating at me and says some poetry at me about in the spring a young mans frenzy likely turns to thoughts of love
Well I says kind of sheepishlike this is summertime and purty nigh autumn
Then I seen Id jest as good as owned up I liked Martha and was kind of mad at myself fur that
But I told him some more about her too
Somehow I jest couldnt help it
He laughs at me and goes on into the tent
I laid there and looked at the fire fur quite a spell outside the tent
I was thinking if all them tales wasnt jest dern foolishness how I wisht I would really find a dad that was a highmucky muck and could come back in an automobile and take her away
I laid there fur a long long time it must of been fur a couple of hours
I supposed the doctor had went to sleep
But all of a sudden I looks up and he is in the door of the tent staring at me
I seen he had been in there at it hard agin and thinking quietlike all this time
He stood there in the doorway of the tent with the firelight onto his face and his red beard and his arms stretched out holding to the canvas and looking at me strange and wild
Then he moved his hand up and down at me and he says If shes fool enough to love you treat her well treat her well
For if you dont you can never run away from the hell youll carry in your own heart
And he kind of doubled up and pitched forward when he said that and if I hadnt ketched him he would of fell right acrost the fire
He was plumb pifflicated
CHAPTER VII Martha wouldnt of took anything fur being around Miss Hampton she said
Miss Hampton was kind of quiet and sweet and pale looking and nobody ever thought of talking loud or raising any fuss when she was around
She had enough money of her own to run herself on and she kep to herself a good deal
She had come to that town from no one knowed where years ago and bought that place
Fur all of her being so gentle and easy and talking with one of them soft drawly kind of voices Martha says no one had ever dared to ast her about herself though they was a lot of women in that town that was wishful to
But Martha said she knowed what Miss Hamp tons secret was and she hadnt told no one neither
Which she told me and all the promising I done about not telling would of made the cold chills run up your back it was so solemn
Miss Hampton had been jilted years ago Martha said and the name of the jilter was David Armstrong
Well he must of been a low down sort of man
Martha said if things was only fixed in this country like they ought to be she would of sent a night to find that David Armstrong
And that would of ended up in a mortal combat and the night would have cleaved him
Yes says I and then you would of married that there night I suppose
She says she would of
Well says I mebby you would of and mebby you wouldnt of
If he cleaved David Armstrong that night would likely be arrested fur it
Martha says if he was she would wait outside his dungeon keep fur years and years till she was a old woman with gray in her hair and every day they would give lingering looks at each other through the window bars
And they would be happy that away
And she would get her a white dove and train it so it would fly up to that window and take in notes to him and he would send notes back thata way and they would both be awful sad and ro manceful and contented doing thataway fur ever and ever
Well I never took no stock in them mournful ways of being happy
I couldnt of riz up to being a night fur Martha
She expected too much of one
I thought it over fur a little spell without saying anything and I tried to make myself believe I would of liked all that dove business
But it wasnt no use pertending
I knowed I would get tired of it
Martha I says mebby these here nights is all right and mebby they aint
I never seen one and I dont know
And mind you I aint saying a word agin their way of acting
I cant say how I would of been myself if I had been brung up like them
But it looks to me from some of the things youve said about em they must have a dern fool streak in em somewheres
I was kind of jealous of them nights I guess or I wouldnt of run em down thataway behind their backs
But the way she was always taking on over them was calkelated to make me see I wasnt kneehigh to a duck in Marthas mind when one of them nights popped into her head
When I run em down thataway she says to the blind all things is blind and if I had any chivalry into me myself Id of seen they wasnt jest dern fools but noble and seen it easy
And she sighed like shed looked fur better things from me
When I hearn her do that I felt sorry I hadnt come up to her expectances
So I says Martha its no use pertending I could stay in one of them jails and keep happy at it
I got to be outdoors
But I tell you what I can do if it will make you feel any better
If I ever happen to run acrost this here David Armstrong and he is anywheres near my size Ill lick him fur you
And if hes too hefty fur me to lick him fair I says and I get a good chancet I will hit him with a piece of railroad iron fur you
Of course I knowed I would never find him
But what I said seemed to brighten her up a little
But says I if I went too fur with it and was hung fur it how would you feel then Martha
Well sir that didnt jar Martha none
She looked kind of dreamy and said mebby she would go and jine a convent and be a nun
And when she got to be the head nun she would build a chapel over the tomb where I was buried in
And every year on the day of the month I was hung on she would lead all the other nuns into that chapel and the organ would play mournful and each nun as passed would lay down a bunch of white roses onto my tomb
I reckon that orter made me feel good but somehow it didnt
So I changed the subject and asts her why I aint seen Miss Hampton around the place none
Martha says she has a bad sick headache and aint been outside the house fur four or five days
I asts her why she dont wait on her
But she dont want her to Martha says
Shes been staying in the house ever since we been in town and jest wants to be let alone
I thinks all that is kind of funny
And then I seen from the way Martha is answering my questions that she is holding back something she would like to tell but dont think she orter tell
I leaves her alone and purty soon she says Do you believe in ghosts
I tell her sometimes I think I dont believe in em and sometimes I think I do but anyhow I would hate to see one
I asts her why does she ast
Because she says becausebut I hadnt ought to tell you
Its daylight I says its no use being scared to tell now
It aint that she says but its a secret
When she said it was a secret I knowed she would tell
Martha liked having her friends help her to keep a secret
I think Miss Hampton has seen one she says finally and that her staying indoors has something to do with that
Then she tells me
The night of the day after we camped there her and Miss Hampton was out fur a walk
We didnt have any show that night
They passed right by our camp and they seen us there by the fire all three of us
But they was in the road in the dark and we was all in the light so none of the three of us seen them
Miss Hampton was kind of scared of us first glance fur she gasped and grabbed holt of Marthas arm all of a sudden so tight she pinched it
Which it was very natcheral that she would be startled coming across three strange men all of a sudden at night around a turn in the road
They went along home and Martha went inside and lighted a lamp but Miss Hampton lingered on the porch fur a minute
Jest as she lit the lamp Martha hearn another little gasp or kind of sigh from Miss Hampton out there on the porch
Then they was the sound of her falling down
Martha ran out with the lamp and she was laying there
She had fainted and keeled over
Martha said jest in the minute she had left her alone on the porch was when Miss Hampton must of seen the ghost
Martha brung her to and she was looking puzzled and wildlike both to oncet
Martha asts her what is the matter
Nothing she says rubbing her fingers over her forehead in a helpless kind of way nothing
You look like you had seen a ghost Martha tells her
Miss Hampton looks at Martha awful funny and then she says mebby she HAS seen a ghost and goes along upstairs to bed
And since then she aint been out of the house
She tells Martha it is a sick headache but Martha says she knows it aint
She thinks she is scared of something
Scared
I says
She wouldnt see no more ghosts in the daytime
Martha says how do I know she wouldnt
She knows a lot about ghosts of all kinds Martha does
Horses and dogs can see them easier than humans even in the daytime and it makes their hair stand up when they do
But some humans that have the gift can see them in the daytime like an animal
And Martha asts me how can I tell but Miss Hamp ton is like that
Well then I says she must be a witch
And if she is a witch why is she scared of them atall
But Martha says if you have second sight you dont need to be a witch to see them in the day time
Well you can never tell about them ghosts
Some says one thing and some says another
Old Mis Primrose in our town she always believed in em firm till her husband died
When he was dying they fixed it up he was to come back and visit her
She told him he had to and he promised
And she left the front door open fur him night after night fur nigh a year in all kinds of weather but Prim rose never come
Mis Primrose says he never lied to her and he always done jest as she told him and if he could of come she knowed he would and when he didnt she quit believing in ghosts
But they was others in our town said it didnt prove nothing at all
They said Primrose had really been lying to her all his life because she was so bossy he had to lie to keep peace in the fambly and she never ketched on
Well if I was a ghost and had of been Mis Primroses husband when I was a human I wouldnt of come back neither even if she had of bullyragged me into one of them deathbed promises
I guess Primrose figgered he had earnt a rest
If they is ghosts what comfort they can get out of coming back where they aint wanted and scaring folks is moren I can see
Its kind of low down I think and foolish too
Them kind of ghosts is like these here overgrown smart alecs that scares kids
They think they are mighty cute but they aint
They are jest foolish
A human or a ghost either that does things like that is jest simply got no principle to him
I hearn a lot of talk about em first and last and I aint ready to say they aint no ghosts nor yet ready to say they is any
To say they is any is to say something that is too plumb unlikely
And too many people has saw them fur me to say they aint any
But if they is or they aint so fur as I can see it dont make much difference
Fur they never do nothing besides scaring you except to rap on tables and tell fortunes and such fool things
Which a human can do it all better and save the expense of paying money to one of these here sperrit mediums that travels around and makes em perform
But all the same they has been nights I has felt different about em myself and less hasty to run em down
Well it dont do no good to speak harsh of no one not even a ghost or a ordinary dead man and if I was to see a ghost mebby I would be all the scareder fur what I have jest wrote
Well with all the talking back and forth we done about them ghosts we couldnt agree
That after noon it seemed like we couldnt agree about any thing
I knowed we would be going away from there before long and I says to myself before I go Im going to have that girl fur my girl or else know the reason why
No matter what I was talking about that idea was in the back of my head and somehow it kind of made me want to pick fusses with her too
We was setting on a log purty deep into the woods and there come a time when neither of us had said nothing fur quite a spell
But after a while I says Martha well be going away from here in two three days now
She never said nothing
Will you be sorry
I asts her
She says she will be sorry
Well I says WHY will you be sorry
I thought she would say because I was going
And then I would be finding out whether she liked me a lot
But she says the reason she will be sorry is because there will be no one new to talk to about things both has read
I was considerable took down when she said that
Martha I says its moren likely I wont never see you agin after I go away
She says that kind of parting comes between the best of friends
I seen I wasnt getting along very fast nor saying what I wanted to say
I reckon one of them Sir Marmeluke fellers would of knowed what to say
Or Doctor Kirby would
Or mebby even Looey would of said it better than I could
So I was kind of mad with myself and I says meanlike If you dont care of course I dont care neither
She never answered that so I gets up and makes like I am starting off
I was going to give you some of them there Injun feathers of mine to remember me by I tells her but if you dont want em theres plenty of others would be glad to take em
But she says she would like to have them
Well I says I will bring them to you to morrow afternoon
She says Thank you
Finally I couldnt stand it no longer
I got brave all of a sudden and busted out Martha III But I got to stuttering and my braveness stut tered itself away
And I finishes up by saying I like you a hull lot Martha
Which wasnt jest exactly what I had planned fur to say
Martha she says she kind of likes me too
Martha I says I like you moren any girl I ever run acrost before
She says Thank you agin
The way she said it riled me up
She said it like she didnt know what I meant nor what I was trying to get out of me
But she did know all the time
I knowed she did
She knowed I knowed it too
Goshdern it I says to myself here I am wasting all this time jest TALKING to her
The right thing to do come to me all of a sudden and like to took my breath away
But I done it
I grabbed her and I kissed her
Twice
And then agin
Because the first was on the chin on account of her jerking her head back
And the second one she didnt help me none
But the third time she helped me a little
And the ones after that she helped me considerable
Well they aint no use trying to talk about the rest of that afternoon
I couldnt rightly describe it if I wanted to
And I reckon its none of any bodys business
Well it makes you feel kind of funny
You want to go out and pick on somebody about four sizes biggern you are and knock the socks offn him
It stands to reason others has felt thataway but you dont believe it
You want to tell people about it one minute
The next minute you have got chills and ague fur fear some one will guess it
And you think the way you are about her is going to last fur always
That evening when I was cooking supper I laughed every time I was spoke to
When Looey and I was hitching up to drive down town to give the show one of the hosses stepped on his foot and I laughed at that and there was purty nigh a fight
And I was handling some bottles and broke one and cut my hand on a piece of glass
I held it out fur a minute dumblike with the blood and medicine dripping off of it and all of a sudden I busted out laughing agin
The doctor asts if I am crazy
And Looey says he has thought I was from the very first and some night him and the doctor will be killed whilst asleep
One of the things we have every night in the show is an Injun dance and Looey and I sings what the doctor calls the Siwash war chant whirling round and round each other and making licks at each other with our tommyhawks and letting out sudden wild yips in the midst of that chant
That night I like to of killed Looey with that tommyhawk I was feeling so good
If it had been a real one instead of paintedup wood I would of killed Looey the lick I give him
The worst part of that was that after the show when we got back to camp and the hosses was picketed out fur the night I had to tell Looey all about how I felt fur an explanation of why I hit him
Which it made Looey right low in his sperrits and he shakes his head and says no good will come of it
Did you ever hear of Romeo and Joliet
he says Mebby I says but what it was I hearn I cant remember
What about them
Well he says they carried on the same as you
And now where are they
Well I says where are they
In the tomb says Looey very sad like they was closte personal friends of hisn
And he told me all about them and how Young Cobalt had done fur them
But from what I could make out it all happened away back in the early days
And shucksI didnt care a dern anyhow
I told him so
Well he says Its been the history of the world that it brings trouble
And he says to look at Damon and Pythias and Othello and the Merchant of Venus
And he named about a hundred prominent couples like that out of Shake speares works
But it ends happy sometimes I says
Not when it is true love it dont says Looey
Look at Anthony and Cleopatra
Yes I says sarcastic like I suppose they are in the tomb too
They are says Looey awful solemn
Yes I says and so is Adam and Eve and Dan and Burrsheba and all the rest of them oldtimers
But I bet they had a good time while they lasted
Looey shakes his head solemn and sighs and goes to sleep very mournful like he has to give me up fur lost
But I cant sleep none myself
So purty soon I gets up and puts on my shoes and sneaks through the woodlot and through the gap in the fence by the apple tree and into Miss Hamp tons yard
It was a beauty of a moonlight night that white and clear and clean you could almost see to read by it like all of everything had been scoured as bright as the bottom of a tin pan
And the shadders was soft and thick and velvety and laid kind of brownishgreeney on the grass
I flopped down in the shadder of some lilac bushes and won dered which was Marthas window
I knowed she would be in bed long ago but Well I was jest plumb foolish that night and I couldnt of kept away fur any money
That moonlight had got into my head it seemed like and made me drunk
But I would rather be looney thataway than to have as much sense as King Solomon and all his adverbs
I was that looney that if I had knowed any poetry I would of said it out loud right up toward that window
I never knowed why poetry was made up before that night
But the only poetry I could think of was about there was a man named Furgeson that lived on Market Street and he had a oneeyed Thomas cat that couldnt well be beat
Which it didnt seem to fit the case so I didnt say her
The porch of that house was part covered with vines but they was kind of gaped apart at one corner
As I laid there in the shadder of the bushes I hearn a fluttering movement light and gentle on that porch
Then all of a sudden I seen some one standing on the edge of the porch where the vines was gaped apart and the moonlight was falling onto them
They must of come there awful soft and still
Whoever it was couldnt see into the shadder where I laid that is if it was a human and not a ghost
Fur my first thought was it might be one of them ghosts I had been running down so that very day and mebby the same one Miss Hamp ton seen on that very same porch
I thought I was in fur it then mebby and I felt like some one had whispered to the back of my neck it ought to be scared
And I WAS scared clean up into my hair
I stared hard fur I couldnt take my eyes away
Then purty soon I seen if it was a ghost it must be a woman ghost
Fur it was dressed in lightcoloured clothes that moved jest a little in the breeze and the clothes was so near the colour of the moonlight they seemed to kind of silver into it
You would of said it had jest floated there and was waiting fur to float away agin when the breeze blowed a little stronger or the moon drawed it
It didnt move fur ever so long
Then it leaned forward through the gap in the vines and I seen the face real plain
It wasnt no ghost it was a lady
Then I knowed it must be Miss Hampton standing there
Away off through the trees our camp fire sent up jest a dull kind of a glow
She was standing there looking at that
I wondered why
CHAPTER VIII The next day we broke camp and was gone from that place and I took away with me the half of a ring me and Martha had chopped in two
We kept on going and by the time punkins and county fairs was getting ripe we was into the upper lefthand corner of Ohio
And there Looey left us
One day Doctor Kirby and me was walking along the main street of a little town and we seen a bangup funeral percession coming
It must of been one of the Grand Army of the Republicans fur they was some of the old soldiers in buggies riding along behind and a big string of people follering in more buggies and some on foot
Every body was looking mighty sollum
But they was one man setting beside the undertaker on the seat of the hearse that was looking sollumer than them all
It was Looey and Ill bet the corpse himself would of felt proud and happy and contented if he could of knowed the style Looey was giving that funeral
It wasnt nothing Looey done fur he didnt do nothing but jest set there with his arms folded onto his bosom and look sad
But he done THAT better than any one else
He done it so well that you forgot the corpse was the chief party to that funeral
Looey took all the glory from him
He had jest natcherally stole that funeral away from its rightful owner with his enjoyment of it
He seen the doctor and me as the hearse went by our corner but he never let on
A couple of hours later Looey comes into camp and says he is going to quit
The doctor asts him if he has inherited money
No says Looey but my aunt has given me a chancet to go into business
Looey says he was born nigh there and was prowling around town the day before and run acrost an old aunt of hisn he had forgot all about
She is awful respectable and religious and ashamed of him being into a travelling show
And she has offered to lend him enough to buy a halfshare in a business
Well says the doctor I hope it will be some thing you are fitted for and will enjoy
But Ive noticed that after a man gets the habit of roaming around this terrestial ball its mighty hard to settle down and watch his vine and fig tree grow
Looey smiles in a sad sort of a way which he seldom smiled fur anything and says he guesses hell like the business
He says they aint many businesses he could take to
Most of them makes you forget this world is but a fleeting show
But he has found a business which keeps you reminded all the time that dust is dust and ash to ashes shalt return
When he first went into the medicine business he said he was drawed to it by the diseases and the sudden dyingsoff it always kept him in mind of
He thought they wasnt no other business could lay over it fur that kind of comfort
But he has found out his mistake
What kind of business are you going into
asts the doctor
I am going to be an undertaker says Looey
My aunt says this town needs the right kind of an undertaker bad
Mr Wilcox the undertaker that town has is getting purty old and shaky Looey says and young Mr Wilcox his son is too lightminded and goes at things too brisk and airy to give it the right kind of a sendoff
People dont want him joking around their corpses and he is a fat young man and cant help making puns even in the presence of the departed
Old Mr Wilcoxs eyesight is getting so poor he made a scandal in that town only the week before
He was composing a departeds face into a last smile but he went too fur with it and give the departed one of them awful mean devilish kind of grins like he had died with a bad temper on
By the time the departeds fambly had found it out things had went too fur and the face had set thataway so it wasnt safe to try to change it any
Old Mr Wilcox had several brands of last looks
One was called Bear Up for We Will Meet Again
The one that had went wrong was his favourite look named O Death Where is Thy Victory
Looeys aunt says she will buy him a partnership if she is satisfied he can fill the towns needs
They have a talk with the Wilcoxes and he rides on the hearse that day fur a tryout
His aunt peeks out behind her bedroom curtains as the percession goes by her house and when she sees the style Looey is giving to that funeral and how easy it comes to him that settles it with her on the spot
And it seems the hull dern town liked it too including the departeds fambly
Looey says they is a lot of chancet fur improve ments in the undertaking game by one whose heart is in his work and he is going into that business to make a success of it and try and get all the funeral trade fur miles around
He reads us an advertise ment of the new firm he has been figgering out fur that towns weekly paper

WILCOX AND SIMMS Main Street Near Depot The doctor he reads it over careful and says she orter drum up trade all right
Looey tells us that mebby if he can get that town educated up to it he will put in a creamatory where he will burn them too but will go slow fur that there sollum and beautiful way of returning ash to ashes might make some prejudice in such a religious town
The last we seen of Looey was a couple of days later when we told him goodbye in his shop
Old Mr Wilcox was explaining to him the science of them last looks he was so famous at when he was a younger man
Young Mr Wilcox was laying on a table fur Looey to practise on and Looey was learning fast
But he nearly broke down when he said goodbye fur he liked the doctor
Doc he says youve been a good friend and I wont never forget you
They aint much I can do and in this deceitful world words is less than actions
But if you ever was to die within a hun dred miles of me Id go he says and no other hands but mine should lay you out
And it wouldnt cost you a cent either
Nor you neither Danny
We thanked him kindly fur the offer and went
The next town we come to there was a county fair and the doctor run acrost an old pal of hisn who had a show on the grounds and wanted to hire him fur what he called a ballyhoo man
Which was the first I ever hearn them called that but I got better acquainted with them since
They are the fellers that stands out in front and gets you all excited about the Siamese twins or the bearded lady or the snakecharmer or the Circassian beauties or whatever it is inside the tent as represented upon the canvas
The doctor says he will do it fur a week jest fur fun and mebby pick up another feller to take Looeys place out there
This fellers name is Watty Sanders and his wife is a fat lady in his own show and very good natured when not intoxicated nor mad at Watty
She was billed on the curtains outside fur five hun dred and fifty pounds and Watty says she really does weigh nigh on to four hundred
But being a fat ladys husband aint no bed of rosy ease at that Watty tells the doctor
Its like every other tradeit has its own perticler responsibilities and troubles
She is a turrible expense to Watty on account of eating so much
The tales that feller told of how hard he has to hustle showing her off in order to support her appetite would of drawed tears from a pawn brokers sign as Doctor Kirby says
Which he found it cheaper fur his hull show to board and sleep in the tent and we done likewise
Well I got a job with that show myself
Watty had a wild man canvas but no wild man so he made me an offer and I took him up
I was from Borneo where theyre all supposed to be captured
Jest as Doctor Kirby would get to his talk about how the wild man had been ketched after great struggle and expense with four men killed and another crippled there would be an awful rumpus on the inside of the tent with wild howlings and the sound of revolvers shot off and a woman screaming
Then I would come busting out all blacked up from head to heel with no more clothes on than the law pervided fur yipping loud and shaking a big spear and rolling my eyes and Watty would come rushing after me firing his revolver
I would make fur the doctor and draw my spear back to jab it clean through him and Watty would grab my arm
And the doctor would whirl round and they would wrastle me to the ground and I would be hand cuffed and dragged back into the tent still howling and struggling to break loose
On the inside my part of the show was to be wild in a cage
I would be chained to the floor and every now and then I would get wilder and rattle my chains and shake the bars and make jumps at the crowd and carry on and make believe I was too mad to eat the pieces of raw meat Watty throwed into the cage
Watty had a snakecharmer woman with an awful long bony kind of neck working fur him and another feller that was her husband and eat glass
The show opened up with them two doing what they said was a comic turn
Then the fat lady come on
Whilst everybody was admiring her size and looking at the number of pounds on them big cheat scales Watty weighed her on the longnecked one would be changing to her snake clothes
Which she only had one snake and he had been in the business so long and was so kind of worn out and tired with being charmed so much it always seemed like a pity to me the way she would take and twist him around
I guess they never was a snake was worked harder fur the little bit he got to eat nor got no sicker of a womans society than poor old Reginald did
After Regi nald had been charmed a while it would be the glass eaters turn
Which he really eat it and the doctor says that kind always dies before they is fifty
I never knowed his right name but what he went by was The Human Ostrich
Wattys wife was awful jealous of Mrs Ostrich fur she got the idea she was carrying on with Watty
One night I hearn an argument from the fenced off part of the tent Watty and his wife slept in
She was setting on Wattys chest and he was gasp ing fur mercy
You know it aint true says Watty kind of smotheredlike
It is says she you own up it is
And she give him a jounce
No darling he gets out of him you know I never could bear them thin scrawny kind of women
And he begins to call her pet names of all kinds and beg her please if she wont get off complete to set somewheres else a minute fur his chest he can feel giving way and his ribs caving in
He called her his plump little woman three or four times and she must of softened up some fur she moved and his voice come stronger but not less meek and lowly
And he follers it up Dolly darling he says I bet I know something my little woman dont know
What is it
the fat lady asts him
You dont know what a cruel weak stomach your hubby has got Watty says awful coaxing like or you wouldnt bear down quite so hard onto itplease Dolly
She begins to blubber and say he is making fun of her big size and if he is mean to her any more or ever looks at another woman agin she will take antifat and fade away to nothing and ruin his show and it is awful hard to be made a joke of all her life and not have no steady home nor nothing like other women does
You know I worship every pound of you little woman says Watty still coaxing
Why cant you trust me
You know Dolly darling I wouldnt take your weight in gold for you
And he tells her they never was but once in all his life he has so much as turned his head to look at another woman and that was by way of a plutonic admiration and no flirting intended he says
And even then it was before he had met his own little woman
And that other woman he says was plump too fur he wouldnt never look at none but a plump woman
What did she weigh
asts Wattys wife
He tells her a measly little three hundred pound
But she wasnt refined like my little woman says Watty and when I seen that I passed her up
And inch by inch Watty coaxed her clean off of him
But the next day she hearn him and Mrs Ostrich giggling about something and she has a reglar tantrum and jest fur meanness goes out and falls down on the race track pertending she has fainted and they cant move her no ways not even roll her
But finally they rousted her out of that by one of these here sprinkling carts backing up agin her and turning loose
But aside from them occasional mean streaks Dolly was real nice and I kind of got to liking her
She tells me that because she is so fat no one wont take her serious like a human being and she wisht she was like other women and had a fambly
That woman wanted a baby too and I bet she would of been good to it fur she was awful good to animals
She had been big from a little girl and never got no sympathy when sick nor nothing and even whilst she played with dolls as a kid she knowed she looked ridiculous and was laughed at
And by jingsthey was the funniest thing come to light before we left that crowd
That poor derned old fat fool HAD a doll yet all hid away and when she was alone she used to take it out and cuddle it
Well Dolly never had many friends and you couldnt blame her much if she did drink a little too much now and then or get mad at Watty fur his goingson and kneel down on him whilst he was asleep
Them was her only faults and I liked the old girl
Yet I could see Watty had his troubles too
That show busted up before the fair closed
Fur one day Wattys wife gets mad at Mrs Ostrich and tries to set on her
And then Mrs Ostrich gets mad too and sicks Reginald onto her
Wattys wife is awful scared of Reginald who dont really have ambition enough to bite no one let alone a lady built so round everywhere he couldnt of got a grip on her
And as fur as wrapping himself around her and squashing her to death Reginald never seen the day he could reach that fur
Regi nalds feelings is plumb friendly toward Dolly when he is turned loose but she dont know that and she has some hysterics and faints in earnest this time
Well they was an awful hullaballo when she come to and fur the sake of peace in the fambly Watty has to fire Mr and Mrs Ostrich and poor old Reginald out of their jobs and the show is busted
So Doctor Kirby and me lit out fur other parts agin
CHAPTER IX We was jogging along one afternoon not fur from a goodsized town at the top of Ohio right on the lake when we run acrost some remainders of a busted circus riding in a stake and chain wagon
They was two fellersboth jugglers acrobats and tumblersand a balloon
The circus had busted without paying them nothing but promises fur months and months and they had took the team and wagon and balloon by attach ment they said
They was carting her from the little burg the show busted in to that goodsized town on the lake
They would sell the team and wagon there and get money enough to put an advertisement in the Billboard which is like a Bible to them showmen that they had a balloon to sell and was at liberty
One of them was the slimmest lightestfooted quickest feller you ever seen with a big nose and dark complected and his name was Tobias
The other was heavier and blonde complected
His name was Dobbs he said and they was the Blanchet Brothers
Doctor Kirby and them got real well acquainted in about three minutes
We drove on ahead and got into the town first
The doctor says that balloon is jest wasted on them fellers
They cant go up in her not knowing that trade but still they ought to be some way fur them to make a little stake out of it before it was sold
The next evening we run acrost them fellers on the street and they was feeling purty blue
They hadnt been able to sell that team and wagon which it was eating its meals reglar in a livery stable and they had been doing stunts in the street that day and passing around the hat but not getting enough fur to pay expenses
Wheres the balloon
asts the doctor
And I seen he was sicking his intellects onto the job of making her pay
In the livery stable with the wagon they tells him
He says he is going to figger out a way to help them boys
They is like all circus performers he saysthey jest knows their own acts and talks about em all the time and studies up ways to make em better and has got no more idea of business outside of that than a rabbit
We all went to the livery stable and overhauled that balloon
It was an awful job too
But they wasnt a rip in her and the parachute was jest as good as new
Theres no reason why we cant give a show of our own says Doctor Kirby with you boys and Danny and me and that balloon
What we want is a lot with a high board fence around it like a baseball grounds and the chance to tap a gas main
He says hell be willing to take a chancet on it even paying the gas company real money to fill her up
What the Doctor didnt know about starting shows wasnt worth knowing
He had even went in for the real drama in his younger days now and then
One of my theatrical productions came very near succeeding too he says
It was a play he says in which the hero falls in love with a pair of Siamese twins and commits suicide because he cant make a choice between them
We played it as comedy in the big towns and tragedy in the little ones he says
But like a fool I booked it for two weeks of middlesized towns and it broke us
The next day he finds a lot that will do jest fine
It has been used fur a school playgrounds but the school has been moved and the old building is to be tore down
He hired the place cheap
And he goes and talks the gas company into giving him credit to fill that balloon
Which I kept wondering what was the use of filling her fur none of the four of us had ever went up in one
And when I seen the handbills he had had printed I wondered all the more
They read as follers Kirbys Komedy Kompany and Open Air Circus Presenting a Peerless Personnel of Artistic Attractions Greatest in the Galaxy of Gaiety is Hartley L Kirby Monologuist and minstrel dancer and vaudevillian in his terpsichorean travesties buoyant burlesques inimitable imitations screaming impersonations refined comedy sketches and popular song hits of the day

Saturday 3 P M Old Vandegrift School Lot Admission 50 Cents Well fur a writer he certainly laid over Looey Doctor Kirby didmore cheerfullike you might say
I seen right off I was to be the Patagonian Chieftain
I was getting more and more of an actor right alongfirst an Injun then a wild Borneo and now a Patagonian
But who is this Alonzo Ackerman
I asts him
Celebrated balloonist says he and the man that invented parachutes
They eat out of his hand
Where is he
asts I
How should I know
he says
How is he going up then
I asts
The doctor chuckles and says it is a good bill a better bill than he thought that it is getting in its work already
He says to me to read it careful and see if it says Alonzo Ackerman is going up
Well it dont
But any one would of thought so the first look
I reckon that bill was some of a liar herself not lying outright but jest hinting a lie
They is a lot of mean stingysouled kind of people wouldnt never lie to help a friend but Doctor Kirby wasnt one of em
But I says when that crowd finds out Alonzo aint going up they will be purty mad
Oh says he I dont think so
The American public are a goodnatured set of chuckleheads mostly
If they get sore Ill talk em out of it
If he had any faults at alland mind you I aint saying Doctor Kirby had anythe one he had hardest was the belief he could talk any crowd into any notion or out of it either
And he loved to do it jest fur the fun of it
Hed rather have the feeling he was doing that than the money any day
He was powerful vain about that gab of hisn Doctor Kirby was
The four of us took around about five thousand bills
The doctor says they is nothing like giving yourself a chancet
And Saturday morning we got the balloon filled up so she showed handsome tugging away there at her ropes
But we had a dern mean time with that balloon too
The doctor says if we have good luck there may be as many as three four hundred people
But Jerusalem
They was two three times that many
By the time the show started I reckon they was nigh a thousand there
The doctor and the Blanchet Brothers was tickled
When they quit coming fast the doctor left the gate and made a little speech telling all about the wonderful show and the great expense it was to get it together and all that
They was a rope stretched between the crowd and us
Back of that was the Blanchet Brothers wagon and our wagon and our little tent
I was jest inside the tent with chains on
Back of every thing else was the balloon
Well the doctor he done a lot of songs and things as advertised
Then the Blanchet Brothers done some of their acts
They was really fine acts too
Then come some more of Doctor Kirbys refined comedy as advertised
Next more Blanchet
Then a lecture about me by the doctor
All in all it takes up about an hour and a half
Then the doctor makes a mighty nice little talk and wishes them all good afternoon thanking them fur their kind intentions and liberal patronage one and all
But when will the balloon go up
asts half a dozen at oncet
The balloon
asts Doctor Kirby surprised
Balloon
Balloon
yells a kid
And the hull crowd took it up and yelled Balloon
Balloon
Balloon
And they crowded up closte to that rope
Doctor Kirby has been getting off the wagon but he gets back on her and stretches his arms wide and motions of em all to come close
Ladies and gentlemen he says please to gather nearup here good peopleand listen
Listen to what I have to sayharken to the utter ings of my voice
There has been a misunder standing here
There has been a misconstruction
There has been ladies and gentlemen a woeful lack of comprehension here
It looked to me like they was beginning to under stand more than he meant them to
I was wonder ing how it would all come out but he never lost his nerve
Listen he says very earnest listen to me
Somehow the idea seems to have gone forth that there would be a balloon ascension here this after noon
How I do not know for what we advertised ladies and gentlemen was that the balloon used by Prof Alonzo Ackerman the illustrious aeronaut would be UPON EXHIBITION
And there she is ladies and gentlemen there she is for every eye to see and gladden with the sight ofright before you ladies and gentlementhe balloon of Alonzo Ackerman the wonderful voyager of the air exactly as represented
During their long career Kirby and Company have never deceived the pub lic
Others may but Kirby and Company are like Caesars wifeKirby and Company are above suspicion
It is the province of Kirbys Komedy Kompany ladies and gentlemen to spread the glad tidings of innocent amusement throughout the length and breadth of this fair land of ours
And there she is before you the balloon as adver tised the gallant ship of the air in which the illus trious Ackerman made so many voyages before he sailed at last into the Great Beyond
You can see her ladies and gentlemen straining at her cords anxious to mount into the heavens and be gone
It is an education in itself ladies and gentlemen a moral education and well worth coming miles to see
Think of itthink of itthe Acker man balloonand then think that the illustrious Ackerman himselfhe was my personal friend ladies and gentlemen and a true friend sticketh closer than a brotherthe illustrious Ackerman is dead
The balloon ladies and gentlemen is there but Ackerman is gone to his reward
Look at that balloon ladies and gentlemen and tell me if you can why should the spirit of mortals be proud
For the man that rode her like a master and tamed her like she was a dove lies cold and dead in a western graveyard ladies and gentlemen and she is here a useless and an idle vanity without the mind that made her go
Well he went on and he told a funny story about Alonzo which I dont believe they ever was no Alonzo Ackerman and a lot of em laughed and he told a pitiful story and they got sollum agin and then another funny story
Well he had em listening and purty soon most of the crowd is feeling in a good humour toward him and one feller yells out Go ityoure a hull show yourself
And some joshes him but they dont seem to be no trouble in the air
When they all look to be in a good humour he holds up a bill and asts how many has them
Many has
He says that is well and then he starts to telling another story
But in the middle of the story that hull dern crowd is took with a fit of laughing
They has looked at the bill closet and seen they is sold and is taking it goodnatured
And still shouting and laughing most of them begins to start along off
And I thought all chancet of trouble was over with
But it wasnt
Fur they is always a natcheral born kicker everywhere and they was one here too
He was a lean feller with a sticking out jaw and one of his eyes was in a kind of a black pocket and he was jest natcherally laying it off to about a dozen fellers that was in a little knot around him
The doctor sees the main part of the crowd going and climbs down offn the wagon
As he does so that hull bunch of about a dozen moves in under the rope and some more that was going out seen it and stopped and come back
Perfessor says the man with the patch over his eye to Doctor Kirby you say this man Acker man is dead
Yes says the doctor eying him over hes dead
How did he die
asts the feller
He died hard I understand says the doctor carelesslike
Fell out of his balloon
Yes
This aeronaut trade is a dangerous trade I hear says the feller with the patch on his eye
They say so says Doctor Kirby easylike
Was you ever an aeronaut yourself
asts the feller
No says the doctor
Never been up in a balloon
No
Well youre going up in one this afternoon
What do you mean
asts Doctor Kirby
Weve come out to see a balloon ascension and were going to see it too
And with that the hull crowd made a rush at the doctor
Well I been in fights before that and I been in fights since then
But I never been in no harder one
The doctor and the two Blanchet brothers and me managed to get backed up agin the fence in a row when the rush come
I guess I done my share and I guess the Blanchet brothers done theirn too
But they was too many of em for ustoo dern many
It wouldnt of ended as quick as it did if Doctor Kirby hadnt gone clean crazy
His back was to the fence and he cleaned out everything in front of him and then he give a wild roar jest like a bull and rushed that hull gang twenty men they waswith his head down
He caught two fellers one in each hand and he cracked their heads together and he caught two more and done the same
But he orter never took his back away from that fence
The hull gang closed in on him and down he went at the bottom of a pile
I was awful busy myself but I seen that pile moving and churning
Then I made a big mistake myself
I kicked a feller in the stomach and another feller caught my leg and down I went
Fur a half a minute I never knowed nothing
And when I come to I was all mashed about the face and two fellers was sitting on me
The crowd was tying Doctor Kirby to that parachute
They straddled legs over the parachute bar and tied his feet below it
He was still fight ing but they was too many fur him
They left his arms untied but they held em and then Then they cut her loose
She went up like she was shot from a gun and as she did Doctor Kirby took a grip on a fellers arm that hadnt let loose quick enough and lifted him plumb offn the ground
He slewed around on the trapeze bar with the fellers weight and slipped head downward
And as he slipped he give that feller a swing and let loose of him and then ketched himself by the crook of one knee
The feller turned over twicet in the air and landed in a little crumpledup pile on the ground and never made a sound
The fellers that had holt of me forgot me and stood up and I stood up too and looked
The balloon was rising fast
Doctor Kirby was trying to pull himself up to the trapeze bar twisting and squirming and having a hard time of it and shoot ing higher every second
I reckoned he couldnt fall complete fur where his feet was tied would likely hold even if his knee come straightbut he would die mebby with his head filling up with blood
But finally he made a squirm and raised himself a lot and grabbed the rope at one side of the bar
And then he reached and got the rope on the other side and set straddle of her
And jest as he done that the wind ketched the balloon good and hard and she turned out toward Lake Erie
It was too late fur him to pull the rope that sets the parachute loose then and drop onto the land
I rushed out of that schoolhouse yard and down the street toward the lake front and run stumbling along and looking up
She was getting smaller every minute
And with my head in the air look ing up I was running plumb to the edge of the water before I knowed it
She was away out over the lake now and awful high and going fast before the wind and the doctor was only a speck
And as I stared at that speck away up in the sky I thought this was a mean world to live in
Fur there was the only real friend I ever had and no way fur me to help him
He had learnt me to read and bought me good clothes and made me know they was things in the world worth travelling around to see and made me feel like I was something more than jest Old Hank Walterss dog
And I guessed he would be drownded and I would never see him agin now
And all of a sudden something busted loose inside of me and I sunk down there at the edge of the water sick at my stomach and weak and shivering
CHAPTER X I didnt exactly faint there but things got all mixed fur me and when they was straightened out agin I was in a hospital
It seems I had been considerable stepped on in that fight and three ribs was broke
I knowed I was hurting but I was so interested in what was happening to the doctor the hull hurt never come to me till the balloon was way out over the lake
But now I was in a plaster cast and before I got out of that I was in a fever
I was some weeks getting out of there
I tried to get some word of Doctor Kirby but couldnt
Nothing had been heard of him or the balloon
The newspapers had had stuff about it fur a day or two and they guessed the body might come to light sometime
But that was all
And I didnt know where to hunt nor how
The hosses and wagon and tent and things worried me some too
They wasnt mine and so I couldnt sell em
And they wasnt no good to me without Doctor Kirby
So I tells the man that owns the livery stable to use the team fur its board and keep it till Doctor Kirby calls fur it and if he never does mebby I will sometime
I didnt want to stay in that town or I could of got a job in the livery stable
They offered me one but I hated that town
I wanted to light out
I didnt much care where to
Them Blanchet Brothers had left a good share of the money we took in at the balloon ascension with the hospital people fur me before they cleared out
But before I left that there town I seen they was one thing I had to do to make myself easy in my mind
So I done her
That was to hunt up that feller with his eye in the patch
It took me a week to find him
He lived down near some railroad yards
I might of soaked him with a coupling link and felt a hull lot better
But I didnt guess it would do to pet and pamper my feelings too much
So I does it with my fists in a quiet place and does it very complete and leaves that town in a cattle car feeling a hull lot more contented in my mind
Then they was a hull dern year I didnt stay nowhere very long nor work at any one job too long neither
I jest worked from place to place seeing thingsbig towns and rivers and moun tains
Working here and there and loafing and riding blind baggages and freight trains between jobs I covered a lot of ground that year and made some purty big jumps and got acquainted with some awful queer folks first and last
But the worst of that is lots of people gets to thinking I am a hobo
Even one or two judges in police courts I got acquainted with had that there idea of me
I always explains that I am not one and am jest travelling around to see things and working when I feels like it and aint no bum
But frequent I am not believed
And two three different times I gets to the place where I couldnt hardly of told myself from a hobo if I hadnt of knowed I wasnt one
I got right well acquainted with some of them hobos too
As fur as I can see they is as much difference in them as in other humans
Some travels because they likes to see things and some because they hates to work and some because they is in the habit and cant stop it
Well I know myself its purty hard after while to stop it fur where would you stop at
What excuse is they to stop one place moren another
I met all kinds of em and oncet I got in fur a week with a couple of real Johnny Yeggs that is both in the pen now
I hearn a feller say one time there is some good in every man
I went the same way as them two yeggmen a hull dern week to try and find out where the good in em was
I guess they must be some mistake somewheres fur I looked hard and I watched closet and I never found it
They is many kinds of hobos and tramps per fessional and amachure and lots of kinds of bums and lots of young fellers working their way around to see things like I was and lots of working men in hard luck going from place to place and all them kinds is humans
But the real yeggman aint even a dog
And oncet I went all the way from Chicago to Baltimore with a serious dern fool that said he was a soshyologest whatever them is and was going to put her all into a book about the criminal classes
He worked hard trying to get at the reason I was a hobo
Which they wasnt no reason fur I wasnt no hobo
But I didnt want to disappoint that feller and spoil his book fur him
So I tells him things
Things not overly truthful but very full of crime
About a year afterward I was into one of these here Andrew Carnegie libaries with the names of the oldtime presidents all chiselled along the top and I seen the hull dern thing in print
He said of me the same thing I have said about them yeggmen
If all he met joshed that feller the same as me that book must of been what you might call misleading in spots
One morning I woke up in a goodsized town in Illinoise not a hundred miles from where I was raised without no money and my clothes not much to look at and no job
I had been with a railroad show fur about two weeks driving stakes and other rough work and it had went off and left me sleeping on the ground
circuses never waits fur nothing nor cares a dern fur no one
I tried all day around town fur to get some kind of a job
But I was looking purty rough and I couldnt land nothing
Along in the afternoon I was awful hungry
I was feeling purty low down to have to ast fur a meal but finally I done it
I dunno how I ever come to pick out such a swell looking house but I makes a little talk at the back door and the Irish girl she says Come in and into the kitchen I goes
Its Minnesota youre working toward
asts she pouring me out a cup of coffee
She is thinking of the wheat harvest where they is thousands makes fur every fall
But none of em fur me
That there country is full of them Scandiluvian Swedes and Norwegians and they gets into the field before daylight and stays there so long the hired mans got to milk the cows by moonlight
I been acrost the river into Iway I says aworking at my trade and now Im going back to Chicago to work at it some more
What might your trade be
she asts sizing me up careful and I thinks Ill hand her one to chew on she aint never hearn tell of before
Im a agnostic by trade I says
I spotted that there word in a religious book one time and thats the first chancet I ever has to try it on any one
You cant never tell what them reglar sockdologers is going to do till you tries them
I see says she
But I seen she didnt see
And I didnt help her none
She would of ruther died than to let on she didnt see
The Irish is like that
Purty soon she says Aint that the dangerous kind o work though
It is I says
And says nothing further
She sets down and folds her arms like she was thinking of it watching my hands closet all the time I was eating like shes looking fur scars where something slipped when I done that agnostic work
Purty soon she says Me brother Michael was kilt at it in the old country
He was the most vinturesome lad of thim all
Did it fly up and hit him
I asts her
I was wondering wether she is making fun of me or am I making fun of her
Them Irish is like that you can never tell which
No says she he fell off of it
And Im think ing you dont know what it is yourself
And the next thing I know Im eased out o the back door and shes grinning at me scornful through the crack of it
So I was walking slow around toward the front of the house thinking how the Irish was a great nation and what shall I do now anyhow
And I says to myself Danny you was a fool to let that circus walk off and leave you asleep in this here town with nothing over you but a barbed wire fence this morning
Fur what ARE you going to do next
First thing you know you WILL be a reglar tramp which some folks cant be made to see you aint now
And jest when I was thinking that a feller comes down the front steps of that house on the jump and nabs me by the coat collar
Did you come out of this house
he asts
I did I says wondering what next
Back in you go then he says marching me forward toward them front steps theyve got smallpox in there
I like to of jumped loose when he says that
Smallpox aint no inducement to me mister I tells him
But he twisted my coat collar tight and dug his thumbs into my neck all the time helping me onward with his knee from behind and I seen they wasnt no use pulling back
I could probable of licked that man but theys no system in mixing up with them welldressed men in towns where they think you are a tramp
The judge will give you the worst of it
He rung the door bell and the girl that opened the door she looked kind o surprised when she seen me and in we went
Tell Professor Booth that Doctor Wilkins wants to see him again says the man aholt o me not letting loose none
And we says nothing further till the perfessor comes which he does slow and absentminded
When he seen me he took off his glasses sos he could see me better and he says What is that you have there Doctor Wilkins
A guest for you says Doctor Wilkins grinning all over hisself
I found him leaving your house
And you being under quarantine and me being secretary to the board of health and the city pesthouse being crowded too full already Ill have to ask you to keep him here till we get Miss Margery onto her feet again he says
Or they was words to that effect as the lawyers asts you
Dear me says Perfesser Booth kind o help less like
And he comes over closet to me and looks me all over like I was one of them amphimissourian lizards in a free museum
And then he goes to the foot of the stairs and sings out in a voice that was so bleachedout and flatchested it would of looked jest like him himself if you could of saw it Estelle he sings out oh Estelle
Estelle she come down stairs looking like she was the perfessors big brother
I found out later she was his old maid sister
She wasnt no spring chicken Estelle wasnt and they was a continuous grin on her face
I figgered it must of froze there years and years ago
They was a kid about ten or eleven years old come along down with her that had hair down to its shoulders and didnt look like it knowed whether it was a girl or a boy
Miss Estelle she looks me over in a way that makes me shiver while the doctor and the perfessor jaws about whose fault it is the smallpox sign aint been hung out
And when she was done listening she says to the perfessor You had better go back to your laboratory
And the perfessor he went along out and the doctor with him
What are you going to do with him Aunt Estelle
the kid asts her
What would YOU suggest William Dear
asts his aunt
I aint feeling very comfortable and I was getting all ready jest to natcherally bolt out the front door now the doctor was gone
Then I thinks it mightnt be no bad place to stay in fur a couple o days even risking the smallpox
Fur I had riccolected I couldnt ketch it nohow having been vaccinated a few months before in Terry Hutt by compulsive medical advice me being fur a while doing some work on the city pavements through a mistake about me in the police court
William Dear looks at me like it was the day of judgment and his job was to keep the fatted calves separate from the goats and prodigals and he says If I were you Aunt Estelle the first thing would be to get his hair cut and his face washed and then get him some clothes
William Dear is my friend thinks I
She calls James which was a butler
James he buttles me into a bathroom the like o which I never seen afore and then he buttles me into a suit o somebodys clothes and into a room at the top o the house next to hisn and then he comes back and buttles a comb and brush at me
James was the most mournfullooking fat man I ever seen and he says that account of me not being respectable I will have my meals alone in the kitchen after the servants has eat
The first thing I knowed I been in that house moren a week
I eat and I slept and I smoked and I kind of enjoyed not worrying about things fur a while
The only oncomfortable thing about being the perfessors guest was Miss Estelle
Soons she found out I was a agnostic she took charge o my intellectuals and what went into em and she makes me read things and asts me about em and she says she is going fur to reform me
And what ever brand o disgrace them there agnostics really is I aint found out to this day having come acrost the word accidental
Biddy Malone which was the kitchen mechanic she says the perfessors wifes been over to her mothers while this smallpox has been going on and they is a nurse in the house looking after Miss Margery the little kid thats sick
And Biddy she says if she was Mrs Booth shed stay there too
Theys been some talk anyhow about Mrs Booth and a musician feller around that there town
But Biddy she likes Mrs Booth and even if it was true which it aint Biddy says who could of blamed her
Fur things aint joyous around that house the last year since Miss Estelles come there to live
The perfessor hes so full of scien tifics he dont know nothing with no sense to it Biddy says
Hes got more moneyn you can shake a stick at and he dont have to do no work nor never has and his scientifics gets worse and worse every year
But while scientifics is worrying to the nerves of a fambly and while his labertory often makes the house smell like a sick drug store has crawled into it and died there they wouldnt of been no serious row on between the perfessor and his wife not ALL the time if it hadnt of been fur Miss Estelle
She has jest natcherally made herself boss of that there house Biddy says and shes a shedevil
Between all them scientifics and Miss Estelle things has got where Mrs Booth cant stand em much longer
I didnt blame her none fur getting sore on her job neither
You cant expect a woman thats purty and knows it and aint no moren thirtytwo or three and dont look it to be serious intrusted in mummies and pickled snakes and chemical perfusions not ALL the time
Mebby when Mrs Booth would ast him if he was going to take her to the opery that night the perfessor would look up in an absentminded sort of way and ast her did she know them Germans had invented a new germ
It wouldnt of been so bad if the perfessor had picked out jest one brand of scientifics and stuck to that reglar
Mrs Booth could of got use to any ONE kind
But mebby this week the perfessor would be took hard with ornithography and hed go chasing hummingbirds all over the front yard and the next hed be putting gastronomy into Williams breakfast feed
They was always a row on over them kids which they hadnt been till Miss Estelle come
Mrs Booth she said they could kill their own selves if they wanted to him and Miss Estelle but she had more right than any one else to say what went into Williams and Margerys digestive ornaments and she didnt want em brung up scientific nohow but jest human
But Miss Estelles got so she runs that hull house now and the perfessor too but he dont know it Biddy says and her asaying every now and then it was too bad Frederick couldnt of married a noble woman who would of took a serious intrust in his work
The kids dont hardly dare to kiss their ma in front of Miss Estelle no more on account of germs and things
And with Miss Estelle taking care of their religious organs and their intellectuals and the things like that and the perfessor filling them up on new invented feeds I guess they never was two kids got more education to the square inch outside and in
It hadnt worked none on Miss Margery yet her being younger but William Dear he took it hard and serious and it made bumps all over his head and he was kind o pale and spindly
Every time that kid cut his finger he jest natcherally bled scientifics
One day I says to Miss Estelle says I It looks to me like William Dear is kind of peaked
She looks worried and she looks mad fur me lipping in and then she says mebby it is true but she dont see why because he is being brung up like he orter be in every way and no ex pense nor trouble spared
Well says I what a kid about that size wants to do is to get out and roll around in the dirt some and yell and holler
She sniffs like I wasnt worth taking no notice of
But it kind o soaked in too
She and the perfessor must of talked it over
Fur the next day I seen her spreading a oilcloth on the hall floor
And then James comes a buttling in with a lot of sand what the perfessor has baked and made all scientific down in his labertory
James he pours all that nice clean dirt onto the oilcloth and then Miss Estelle sends fur William Dear
William Dear she says we have decided your papa and I that what you need is more romp ing around and playing along with your studies
You ought to get closer to the soil and to nature as is more healthy for a youth of your age
So for an hour each day between your studies you will romp and play in this sand
You may begin to frolic now William Dear and then James will sweep up the dirt again for tomorrows frolic
But William didnt frolic none
He jest looked at that dirt in a sad kind o way and he says very serious but very decided Aunt Estelle I shall NOT frolic
And they had to let it go at that fur he never would frolic none neither
And all that nice clean dirt was throwed out in the back yard along with the unscientific dirt
CHAPTER XI One night when Ive been there moren a week and am getting kind o tired staying in one place so long I dont want to go to bed after I eats and I gets aholt of some of the perfessors cigars and goes into the libary to see if hes got anything fit to read
Setting there thinking of the awful remarkable people they is in this world I must of went to sleep
Purty soon in my sleep I hearn two voices
Then I waked up sudden and still hearn em low and quick like in the room that opens right off of the libary with a couple of them sliding doors like is onto a box car
One voice was a womans voice and it wasnt Miss Estelles
But I MUST see them before we go Henry she says
And the other was a mans voice and it wasnt no one around our house
But my God he says suppose you get it yourself Jane
I set up straight then fur Jane was the perfessors wifes first name
You mean suppose YOU get it she says
I like to of seen the look she must of give him to fit in with the way she says that YOU
He didnt say nothing the man didnt and then her voice softens down some and she says low and slow Henry wouldnt you love me if I DID get it
Suppose it marked and pitted me all up
Oh of course he says of course I would
Nothing can change the way I feel
YOU know that
He said it quick enough all right jest the way they does in a show but it sounded TOO MUCH like it does on the stage to of suited me if ID been her
I seen folks overdo them little talks before this
I listens some more and then I sees how it is
This is that musician feller Biddy Malones been talking about
Janes going to run off with him all right but shes got to kiss the kids first
Women is like that
They may hate the kids pa all right but theys dadburned few of em dont like the kids
I thinks to myself It must be late
I bet they was already started or ready to start and she made him bring her here first sos she could sneak in and see the kids
She jest simply couldnt get by
But shes taking a fool risk too
Fur hows she going to see Margery with that nurse coming and going and hanging around all night
And even if she tries jest to see William Dear its a ten to one shot hell wake up and shell be ketched at it
And then I thinks suppose she IS ketched at it
What of it
Aint a woman got a right to come into her own house with her own door key even if they is a quarantine onto it and see her kids
And if she is ketched seeing them how would any one know she was going to run off
And aint she got a right to have a friend of hern and her husbands bring her over from her mothers house even if it is a little late
Then I seen she wasnt taking no great risks neither and I thinks mebby I better go and tell that perfessor what is going on fur he has treated me purty white
And then I thinks Ill be goshderned if I meddle
So fur as I can see that there perfessor aint getting fur from whats coming to him nohow
And as fur HER you got to let some people find out what they want fur their selves
Anyhow where do I come in at
But I want to get a look at her and Henry anyhow
So I eases off my shoes carefullike and I eases acrost the floor to them sliding doors and I puts my eye down to the little crack
The talk is going backward and forward between them two him wanting her to come away quick and her undecided whether to risk seeing the kids
And all the time shes kind o hoping mebby she will be ketched if she tries to see the kids and shes begging off fur more time ginerally
Well sir I didnt blame that musician feller none when I seen her
She was a peach
And I couldnt blame her so much neither when I thought of Miss Estelle and all them scientifics of the perfessors strung out fur years and years world without end
Yet when I seen the man I sort o wished she wouldnt
I seen right off that Henry wouldnt do
It takes a man with a lot of gumption to keep a woman feeling good and not sorry fur doing it when hes married to her
But it takes a man with twicet as much to make her feel right when they aint married
This feller wears one of them little brown pointed beards fur to hide where his chin aint
And his eyes is too much like a womans
Which is the kind that gets the biggest piece of pie at the lunch counter and fergits to thank the girl as cuts it big
She was setting in front of a table twisting her fingers together and he was walking up and down
I seen he was mad and trying not to show it and I seen he was scared of the smallpox and trying not to show that too
And jest about that time something happened that kind o jolted me
They was one of them big chairs in the room where they was that has got a high back and spins around on itself
It was right acrost from me on the other side of the room and it was facing the front window which was a bow window
And that there chair begins to turn slow and easy
First I thought she wasnt turning
Then I seen she was
But Jane and Henry didnt
They was all took up with each other in the middle of the room with their backs to it
Henry is abegging of Jane and she turns a little more that chair does
Will she squeak I wonders
Dont you be a fool Jane says the Henry feller
Around she comes three hull inches that there chair and nary a squeak
A fool
asts Jane and laughs
And Im not a fool to think of going with you at all then
That chair she moved six inches more and I seen the calf of a leg and part of a crumpledup coat tail
But I AM going with you Henry says Jane
And she gets up jest like she is going to put her arms around him
But Jane dont
Fur that chair swings clear around and there sets the perfessor
Hes all hunched up and caved in and hes rubbing his eyes like hes jest woke up recent and hes got a grin onto his face that makes him look like his sister Estelle looks all the time
Excuse me says the perfessor
They both swings around and faces him
I can hear my heart bumping
Jane never says a word
The man with the brown beard never says a word
But if they felt like me they both felt like laying right down there and having a fit
They looks at him and he jest sets there and grins at them
But after a while Jane she says Well now you KNOW
What are you going to do about it
Henry he starts to say something too
But Dont start anything says the perfessor to him
YOU arent going to do anything
Or they was words to that effect
Professor Booth he says seeing he has got to say something or else Jane will think the worse of him I am Keep still says the perfessor real quiet
Ill tend to you in a minute or two
YOU dont count for much
This thing is mostly between me and my wife
When he talks so decided I thinks mebby that perfessor has got something into him besides science after all
Jane she looks kind o surprised herself
But she says nothing except What are you going to do Frederick
And she laughs one of them mean kind of laughs and looks at Henry like she wanted him to spunk up a little more and says What CAN you do Fred erick
Frederick he says not excited a bit Theres quite a number of things I COULD do that would look bad when they got into the news papers
But its none of them unless one of you forces me to it
Then he says You DID want to see the children Jane
She nodded
Jane he says cant you see Im the better man
The perfessor he was woke up after all them years of scientifics and he didnt want to see her go
Look at him he says pointing to the feller with the brown beard hes scared stiff right now
Which I would of been scared myself if Id abeen ketched thataway like Henry was and the per fessors voice sounding like you was chopping ice every time he spoke
I seen the perfessor didnt want to have no blood on the carpet without he had to have it but I seen he was making up his mind about something too
Jane she says YOU a better man
YOU
You think youve been a model husband just because youve never beaten me dont you
No says the perfessor Ive been a blamed fool all right
Ive been a worse fool maybe than if I HAD beaten you
Then he turns to Henry and he says Duels are out of fashion arent they
And a plain killing looks bad in the papers doesnt it
Well you just wait for me
With which he gets up and trots out and I hearn him running down stairs to his labertory
Henry hed ruther go now
He dont want to wait
But with Jane alooking at him hes shamed not to wait
Its his place to make some kind of a strong action now to show Jane he is a great man
But he dont do it
And Jane is too much of a thoroughbred to show him she expects it
And me Im getting the fidgets and wondering to myself What is that there perfessor up to now
What ever it is it aint like no one else
He is looney that perfessor is
And she is kind o looney too
I wonder if they is any one that aint looney some times
I been around the country a good eal too and seen and hearn of some awful remarkable things and I never seen no one that wasnt more or less looney when the SEARCH US THE FEMM comes into the case
Which is a Dago word I got outn a newspaper and it means Who was the dead gents lady friend
And we all set and sweat and got the fidgets waiting fur that perfessor to come back
Which he done with that Sister Estelle grin onto his face and a pill box in his hand
They was two pills in the box
He says placid and chilly Yes sir duels are out of fashion
This is the age of science
All the same the one that gets her has got to fight for her
If she isnt worth fighting for she isnt worth having
Here are two pills
I made em myself
One has enough poison in it to kill a regiment when it gets to working wellwhich it does fifteen minutes after it is taken
The other one has got nothing harmful in it
If you get the poison one I keep her
If I get it you can have her
Only I hope you will wait long enough after Im dead so there wont be any scandal around town
Henry he never said a word
He opened his mouth but nothing come of it
When he done that I thought I hearn his tongue scrape agin his cheek on the inside like a piece of sandpaper
He was scared Henry was
But YOU know which is which Jane sings out
The things not fair
That is the reason my dear Jane is going to shuffle these pills around each other herself says the perfessor and then pick out one for him and one for me
YOU dont know which is which Jane
And as he is the favourite he is going to get the first chance
If he gets the one I want him to get he will have just fifteen minutes to live after taking it
In that fifteen minutes he will please to walk so far from my house that he wont die near it and make a scandal
I wont have a scandal without I have to
Everything is going to be nice and quiet and respectable
The effect of the poison is similar to heart failure
No one can tell the difference on the corpse
Theres going to be no blood anywhere
I will be found dead in my house in the morning with heart failure or else he will be picked up dead in the street far enough away so as to make no talk
Or they was words to that effect
He is rubbing it in considerable I thinks that perfessor is
I wonder if I better jump in and stop the hull thing
Then I thinks No its between them three
Besides I want to see which one is going to get that there loaded pill
I always been intrusted in games of chancet of all kinds and when I seen the perfessor was such a sport Im sorry I been misjudging him all this time
Jane she looks at the box and she breathes hard and quick
I wont touch em she says
I refuse to be a party to any murder of that kind
Huh
You do
says the perfessor
But the time when you might have refused has gone by
You have made yourself a party to it already
Youre really the MAIN party to it
But do as you like he goes on
Im giving him more chance than I ought to with those pills
I might shoot him and I would and then face the music if it wasnt for mixing the children up in the scandal Jane
If you want to see him get a fair chance Jane youve got to hand out these pills one to him and then one to me
YOU must kill one or the other of us or else ILL kill HIM the other way
And YOU had better pick one out for him because I know which is which
Or else let him pick one out for himself he says
Henry he wasnt saying nothing
I thought he had fainted
But he hadnt
I seen him licking his lips
I bet Henrys mouth was all dry inside
Jane she took the box and she went round in front of Henry and she looked at him hard
She looked at him like she was thinking Fur Gods sake spunk up some and take one if it DOES kill you
Then she says out loud Henry if you die I will die too
And Henry he took one
His hand shook but he took it outn the box
If she had of looked like that at me mebby I would of took one myself
Fur Jane she was a peach she was
But I dont know whether I would of or not
When she makes that brag about dying I looked at the perfessor
What she said never fazed him
And I thinks agin Mebby I better jump in now and stop this thing
And then I thinks agin No it is between them three and Providence
Besides Im anxious to see who is going to get that pill with the science in it
I gets to feeling jest like Providence hisself was in that there room picking out them pills with his own hands
And I was anxious to see what Providences ideas of right and wrong was like
So fur as I could see they was all three in the wrong but if I had of been in there running them pills in Providences place I would of let them all off kind o easy
Henry he aint eat his pill yet
He is jest looking at it and shaking
The perfessor pulls out his watch and lays it on the table
It is a quarter past eleven he says
Mr Murray are you going to make me shoot you after all
I didnt want a scandal he says
Its for you to say whether you want to eat that pill and get your even chance or whether you want to get shot
The shooting method is sure but it causes talk
These pills wont
WHICH
And he pulls a revolver
Which I suppose he had got that too when he went down after them pills
Henry he looks at the gun
Then he looks at the pill
Then he swallers the pill
The perfessor puts his gun back into his pocket and then he puts his pill into his mouth
He dont swaller it
He looks at the watch and he looks at Henry
Sixteen minutes past eleven he says
AT EXACTLY TWENTYNINE MINUTES TO TWELVE MR MURRAY WILL BE DEAD
I got the harmless one
I can tell by the taste
And he put the pieces out into his hand to show that he has chewed hisn up not being willing to wait fifteen minutes fur a verdict from his digestive ornaments
Then he put them pieces back into his mouth and chewed em up and swallered em down like he was eating cough drops
Henry has got sweat breaking out all over his face and he tries to make fur the door but he falls down onto a sofa
This is murder he says weaklike
And he tries to get up again but this time he falls to the floor in a dead faint
Its a dern short fifteen minutes I thinks to myself
That perfessor must of put more science into Henrys pill than he thought he did fur it to of knocked him out this quick
It aint skeercly three minutes
When Henry falls the woman staggers and tries to throw herself on top of him
The corners of her mouth was all drawed down and her eyes was turned up
But she dont yell none
She cant
She tries but she jest gurgles in her throat
The perfessor wont let her fall acrost Henry
He ketches her
Sit up Jane he says with that Estelle look onto his face and let us have a talk
She looks at him with no more sense in her face than a piece of putty has got
But she cant look away from him
And Im kind o paralyzed too
If that feller laying on the floor had only jest kicked oncet or grunted or done something I could of loosened up and yelled and I would of
I jest NEEDED to fetch a yell
But Henry aint moren dropped down there till Im feeling jest like hed ALWAYS been there and Id ALWAYS been staring into that room and the last word any one spoke was said hundreds and hundreds of years ago
Youre a murderer says Jane in a whisper looking at the perfessor in that stareeyed way
Youre a MURDERER she says saying it like she was trying to make herself feel sure he really was one
Murder
says the perfessor
Did you think I was going to run any chances for a pup like him
Hes scared thats all
Hes just fainted through fright
Hes a coward
Those pills were both just bread and sugar
Hell be all right in a minute or two
Ive just been showing you that the fellow hasnt got nerve enough nor brains enough for a fine woman like you Jane he says
Then Jane begins to sob and laugh both to oncet kind o wild like her voice clucking like a hen does and she says Its worse then its worse
Its worse for me than if it were a murder
Some farces can be more tragic than any tragedy ever was she says
Or they was words to that effect
And if Henry had of been really dead she couldnt of took it no harder than she begun to take it now when she saw he was alive but jest wasnt no good
But I seen she was taking on fur herself now moren fur Henry
Doctor Kirby always use to say women is made unlike most other animals in many ways
When they is foolish about a man they can stand to have that man killed a good eal better than to have him showed up ridiculous right in front of them
They will still be crazy about the man that is dead even if he was crooked
But they dont never forgive the fellow that lets himself be made a fool and lets them look foolish too
And when the perfessor kicks Henry in the ribs and Henry comes to and sneaks out Jane she never even turns her head and looks at him
Jane says the perfessor when she quiets down some you have a lot o things to forgive me
But do you suppose I have learned enough so that we can make a go of it if we start all over again
But Jane she never said nothing
Jane he says Estelle is going back to New England as soon as Margery gets well and she will stay there for good
Jane she begins to take a little intrust then
Did Estelle tell you so
she asts
No says the perfessor
Estelle doesnt know it yet
Im going to break the news to her in the morning
But Jane still hates him
Shes making herself hate him hard
She wouldnt of been a human woman if she had let herself be coaxed up all to oncet
Purty soon she says Im tired
And she went out looking like the perfessor was a perfect stranger
She was a peace Jane was
After she left the perfessor set there quite a spell and smoked
And he was looking tired out too
They wasnt no mistake about me
I was jest dead all through my legs
CHAPTER XII I was down in the perfessors labertory one day and that was a queer place
They was every kind of scientifics that has ever been dis covered in it
Some was pickled in bottles and some was stuffed and some was pinned to the walls with their wings spread out
If you took hold of anything it was likely to be a skull and give you the shivers or some electric contraption and shock you and if you tipped over a jar and it broke enough germs might get loose to slaughter a hull town
I was helping the perfessor to unpack a lot of stuff some friends had sent him and I noticed a bottle that had onto it blowed in the glass DANIEL DUNNE AND COMPANY Thats funny says I out loud
What is
asts the perfessor
I showed him the bottle and told him how I was named after the company that made em
He says to look around me
They is all kinds of glass ware in that roombottles and jars and queer shaped things with crooked tails and nosesand nigh every piece of glass the perfessor owns is made by that company
Why says the perfessor their factory is in this very town
And nothing would do fur me but I must go and see that factory
I couldnt till the quarantine was pried loose from our house
But when it was I went down town and hunted up the place and looked her over
It was a big factory and I was kind of proud of that
I was glad she wasnt no measly little old fashioned rundown concern
Of course I wasnt really no relation to it and it wasnt none to me
But I was named fur it too and it come about as near to being a fambly as anything I had ever had or was likely to find
So I was proud it seemed to be doing so well
I thinks as I looks at her of the thousands and thousands of bottles that has been coming out of there fur years and years and will be fur years and years to come
And one bottle not so much different from another one
And all that was really knowed about me was jest the name on one out of all them millions and millions of bottles
It made me feel kind of queer when I thought of that as if I didnt have no separate place in the world any more than one of them millions of bottles
If any one will shut his eyes and say his own name over and over agin fur quite a spell he will get kind of wonderized and mesmerized adoing ithe will begin to wonder who the dickens he is anyhow and what he is and what the difference between him and the next feller is
He will wonder why he happens to be himself and the next feller HIMSELF
He wonders where himself leaves off and the rest of the world begins
I been that way myselfall wonderized so that I felt jest like I was a melting piece of the hull creation and it was all shifting and drifting and changing and flowing and not solid anywhere and I could hardly keep myself from flowing into it
It makes a person feel awful queer like seeing a ghost would
It makes him feel like HE wasnt no solider than a ghost himself
Well if you ever done that and got that feeling you KNOW what I mean
All of a sudden when I am trying to take in all them millions and millions of bottles it rushed onto me that feeling strong
Thinking of them bottles had somehow brung it on
The bigness of the hull creation and the smallness of me and the gait at which everything was racing and rushing ahead made me want to grab hold of something solid and hang on
I reached out my hand and it hit something solid all right
It was a feller who was wheeling out a hand truck loaded with boxes from the shipping department
I had been standing by the shipping department door and I reached right agin him
He wants to know if I am drunk or a blanked fool
So after some talk of that kind I borrows a chew of tobacco of him and we gets right well acquainted
I helped him finish loading his wagon and rode over to the freight depot with him and helped him unload her
Lifting one of them boxes down from the wagon I got such a shock I like to of dropped her
Fur she was marked so many dozen glass handle with care and she was addressed to Dr Hartley L Kirby Atlanta Ga
I managed to get that box onto the platform with out busting her and then I sets down on top of her awful weak
Whats the matter
asts the feller I was with
Nothing says I
You look sick he says
And I WAS feeling thataway
Mebby I do says I and its enough to shake a feller up to find a dead man come to life sudden like this
Great snakes no
says he looking all around where
But I didnt stop to chew the rag none
I left him right there with his mouth wide open staring after me like I was crazy
Half a block away I looked back and I seen him double over and slap his knee and laugh loud like he had hearn a big joke but what he was laughing at I never knew
I was tickled
Tickled
Jest so tickled I was plumb foolish with it
The doctor was alive after allI kept saying it over and over to myselfhe hadnt drownded nor blowed away
And I was go ing to hunt him up
I had a little money
The perfessor had paid it to me
He had give me a job helping take care of his hosses and things like that and wanted me to stay and I had been thinking mebby I would fur a while
But not now
I calkelated I could grab a ride that very night that would put me into Evansville the next morning
I figgered if I ketched a through freight from there on the next night I might get where he was almost as quick as them bottles did
I didnt think it was no use writing out my resignation fur the perfessor
But I got quite a bit of grub from Biddy Malone to make a start on fur I didnt figger on spending no more money than I had to on grub
She asts me a lot of questions and I had to lie to her a good deal but I got the grub
And at ten that night I was in an empty bumping along south along with a crosseyed feller named Looney Hogan who happened to be travelling the same way
Riding on trains without paying fare aint always the easy thing it sounds
It is like a trade that has got to be learned
They is different ways of doing it
I have done every way frequent except one
That I give up after trying her two three times
That is riding the rods down underneath the cars with a piece of board put acrost em to lay yourself on
I never want to go ANYWHERES agin bad enough to ride the rods
Because sometimes you arrive where you are going to partly smeared over the trucks and in no condi tion fur to be made welcome to our city as Doctor Kirby would say
Sometimes you dont arrive
Every oncet in a while you read a little piece in a newspaper about a man being found alongside the tracks considerable cut up or laying right acrost them mebby
He is held in the morgue a while and no one knows who he is and none of the train crew knows they has run over a man and the engineer says they wasnt none on the track
Moren likely that feller has been riding the rods along about the middle of the train
Mebby he let himself go to sleep and jest rolled off
Mebby his piece of board slipped and he fell when the train jolted
Or mebby he jest natcherally made up his mind he rather let loose and get squashed then get any more cinders into his eyes
Riding the blind baggage or the bumpers gives me all the excitement I wants or all the gambling chancet either others can have the rods fur all of me
And they IS some people ack shally says they likes em best
A good place if it is winter time is the feed rack over a cattle car fur the heat and steam from all them steers in there will keep you warm
But dont crawl in no lumber car that is only loaded about half full and short lengths and bundles of laths and shingles in her fur they is likely to get to shifting and bumping
Baled hay is purty good sometimes
Myself not being like these bums that is too proud to work I have often helped the fireman shovel coal and paid fur my ride thataway
But an empty fur gineral purposes will do about as well as anything
This feller Looney Hogan that was with me was a kind of a harmless critter and he didnt know jest where he was going nor why
He was mostly scared of things and if you spoke to him quick he shivered first and then grinned idiotic so you wouldnt kick him and when he talked he had a silly little giggle
He had been made thataway in a reform school where they took him young and tried to work the cussedness outn him by batting him around
They worked it out and purty nigh every thing else along with it I guess
Looney had had a pardner whose name was Slim he said but a couple of years before Slim had fell overboard offn a barge up to Duluth and never come up agin
Looney knowed Slim was drownded all right but he was always travelling around looking at tanks and freight depots and switch shanties fur Slims mark to be fresh cut with a knife somewheres so he would know where to foller and ketch up with him agin
He knowed he would never find Slims mark he said but he kept alooking and he guessed that was the way he got the name of Looney
Looney left me at Evansville
He said he was going east from there he guessed
And I went along south
But I was hindered considerable being put off of trains three or four times and hav ing to grab these here slow local freights between towns all the way down through Kentuckey
Any wheres south of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River trainmen is grouchier to them they thinks is bums than north of it anyhow
And in some parts of it if a real bum gets pinched heaven help im fur nothing else wont
One night between twelve and one oclock I was put off of a freight train fur the second time in a place in the northern part of Tennessee right near the Kentuckey line
I set down in a lumber yard near the railroad track and when she started up agin I grabbed onto the iron ladder and swung my self aboard
But the brakeman was watching fur me and clumb down the ladder and stamped on my fingers
So I dropped off with one finger con siderable mashed and set down in that lumber yard wondering what next
It was a dark night and so fur as I could see they wasnt much moving in that town
Only a few places was lit up
One was way acrost the town square from me and it was the telephone exchange with a man operator reading a book in there
The other was the telegraph room in the depot about a hundred yards from me and they was only two fellers in it both smoking
The main business part of the town was built up around the square like lots of oldfashioned towns is and they was jest enough brightness from four five electric lights to show the shape of the square and be reflected from the windows of the closedup stores
I knowed they was likely a watchman somewheres about too
I guessed I wouldnt wander around none and run no chances of getting took up by him
So I was getting ready to lay down on top of a level pile of boards and go to sleep when I hearn a curious kind of noise a way off like it must be at the edge of town
It sounded like quite a bunch of cattle might shuffling along a dusty road
The night was so quiet you could hear things plain from a long ways off
It growed a little louder and a little nearer
And then it struck a plank bridge somewheres and come acrost it with a clatter
Then I knowed it wasnt cattle
Cows and steers dont make that cantering kind of noise as a rule they trot
It was hosses crossing that bridge
And they was quite a lot of em
As they struck the dirt road agin I hearn a shot
And then another and another
Then a dozen all to oncet and away off through the night a woman screamed
I seen the man in the telephone place fling down his book and grab a pistol from I dont know where
He stepped out into the street and fired three shots into the air as fast as he could pull the trigger
And as he done so they was a light flashed out in a build ing way down the railroad track and shots come answering from there
Mens voices began to yell out they was the noise of people running along plank sidewalks and windows opening in the dark
Then with a rush the galloping noise come nearer come closet raced by the place where I was hiding and nigh a hundred men with guns swept right into the middle of that square and pulled their hosses up
CHAPTER XIII I seen the feller from the telephone exchange run down the street a little ways as the first rush hit the square and fire his pistol twice
Then he turned and made fur an alleyway but as he turned they let him have it
He throwed up his arms and made one long stagger right acrost the bar of light that streamed out of the windows and he fell into the shadder out of sight jest like a scorched moth drops dead into the dark ness from a torch
Out of the middle of that bunch of riders come a big voice yelling numbers instead of mens names
Then different crowds lit out in all directions some on foot while others held their hossesfur they seemed to have a plan laid ahead
And then things began to happen
They hap pened so quick and with such a whirl it was all unreal to meshots and shouts and windows breaking as they blazed away at the store fronts all around the squareand orders and cusswords ringing out between the noise of shootingand those electric lights shining on them as they tossed and trampled and showing up masked faces here and thereand pounding hoofs and hosses scream like humans with excitementand spurts of flame squirted sudden out of the ring of darkness round about the open placeand a bulldog shut up in a store somewheres howling himself hoarse and white puffs of powder smoke like ghosts that went adrifting by the lightsit was all unreal to me as if I had a fever and was dreaming it
That square was like a great big stage in front of me and I laid in the darkness on my lumber pile and watched things like a shownot much scared because it WAS so derned unreal
From way down along the railroad track they come a sort of blunted roar like blasting big stumps outand then another and another
Purty soon down that way a slim flame licked up the side of a big building there and crooked its tongue over the top
Then a second big building right beside it ketched afire and they both showed up in their own light big and angry and handsome and the light showed up the men in front of em too guarding em I guess fur fear the town would get its nerve and make a fight to put em out
They begun to light the whole town up as light as day and paint a red patch onto the sky that must of been noticed fur miles around
It was a mighty purty sight to see em burn
The smoke was rolling high too and the sparks flying and other things in danger of ketching and after while a lick of smoke come drifting up my way
I smelt her
It was tobacco burning in them warehouses
But that town had some fight in her in spite of being took unexpected thataway
It wasnt no coward town
The light from the burning buildings made all the shadders around about seem all the darker
And every once in a while after the surprise of the first rush they would come thin little streaks of fire out of the darkness somewheres and the sound of shots
And then a gang of riders would gallop in that direction shooting up all crea tion
But by the time the warehouses was all lit up so that you could see they was no hope of putting them out the shooting from the darkness had jest about stopped
It looked like them big tobacco warehouses was the main object of the raid
Fur when they was burning past all chancet of saving with walls and floors atumbling and crashing down and sending up great gouts of fresh flame as they fell the leader sings out an order and all that is not on their hosses jumps on and they rides away from the blaze
They come across the squarenot galloping now but taking it easy laughing and talking and cussing and joking each otherand passed right by my lumber pile agin and down the street they had come
You bet I laid low on them boards while they was going by and flattened myself out till I felt like a shingle
As I hearn their hoofsounds getting farther off I lifts up my head agin
But they wasnt all gone either
Three that must of been up to some perticler deviltry of their own come galloping acrost the square to ketch up with the main bunch
Two was quite a bit ahead of the third one and he yelled to them to wait
But they only laughed and rode harder
And then fur some fool reason that last feller pulled up his hoss and stopped
He stopped in the road right in front of me and wheeled his hoss acrost the road and stood up in his stirrups and took a long look at that blaze
Youd a said he had done it all himself and was mighty proud of it the way he raised his head and looked back at that town
He was so near that I hearn him draw in a slow deep breath
He stood still fur most a minute like that black agin the red sky and then he turned his hosss head and jabbed him with his stirrup edge
Jest as the hoss started they come a shot from somewheres behind me
I spose they was some one hid in the lumber piles where the street crossed the railway besides myself
The hoss jumped forward at the shot and the feller swayed sideways and dropped his gun and lost his stirrups and come down heavy on the ground
His hoss galloped off
I heard the noise of some one running off through the dark and stumbling agin the lumber
It was the feller who had fired the shot running away
I suppose he thought the rest of them riders would come back when they heard that shot and hunt him down
I thought they might myself
But I laid there and jest waited
If they come I didnt want to be found running
But they didnt come
The two last ones had caught up with the main gang I guess fur purty soon I hearn them all crossing that plank bridge agin and knowed they was gone
At first I guessed the feller on the ground must be dead
But he wasnt fur purty soon I hearn him groan
He had mebby been stunned by his fall and was coming to enough to feel his pain
I didnt feel like he orter be left there
So I clumb down and went over to him
He was lying on one side all kind of huddled up
There had been a mask on his face like the rest of them with some hair onto the bottom of it to look like a beard
But now it had slipped down till it hung loose around his neck by the string
They was enough light to see he wasnt nothing but a young feller
He raised himself slow as I come near him leaning on one arm and trying to set up
The other arm hung loose and helpless
Half setting up thata way he made a feel at his belt with his good hand as I come near
But that good arm was his prop and when he took it off the ground he fell back
His hand come away empty from his belt
The big sixshooter he had been feeling fur wasnt in its holster anyhow
It had fell out when he tumbled
I picked it up in the road jest a few feet from his shotgun and stood there with it in my hand looking down at him
Well he says in a drawly kind of voice slow and feeble but looking at me steady and trying to raise himself agin yo can finish yo little job nowyo shot me from the darkness and now yo done got my pistol
I reckon yo better shoot AGIN
I dont want to rub it in none I says with you down and out but from what I seen around this town tonight I guess you and your own gang got no GREAT objections to shooting from the dark yourselves
Why dont yo shoot then
he says
It most suttinly is YO turn now
And he never batted an eye
Bo I says you got nerve
I LIKE you Bo
I didnt shoot you and I aint going to
The feller that did has went
Im going to get you out of this
Where you hurt
Hip he says but that aint much
The thing that bothers me is this arm
Its done busted
I fell on it
I drug him out of the road and back of the lumber pile I had been laying on and hurt him considerable adoing it
Now I says what can I do fur you
I reckon yo better leave me he says without yo want to get yoself mixed up in all this
If I do I says you may bleed to death here or anyway you would get found in the morning and be run in
Yo mighty good to me says he considering yo are no kin to this here part of the country at all
I reckon by yo talk yo are one of them damn Yankees aint yo
In Illinoise a Yankee is some one from the East but down South he is anybody from north of the Ohio and though that there war was fought forty years ago some of them fellers down there dont know damn and Yankee is two words yet
But shucksthey dont mean no harm by it
So I tells him I am a damn Yankee and asts him agin if I can do anything fur him
Yes he says yo can tell a friend of mine Bud Davis has happened to an accident and get him over here quick with his wagon to tote me home
I was to go down the railroad track past them burning warehouses till I come to the third street and then turn to my left
The third house from the track has got an iron picket fence in front of it says Bud and its the only house in that part of town which has
Beauregard Peoples lives there
He is kin to me
Yes I says and Beauregard is jest as likely as not going to take a shot out of the front window at me fur luck afore I can tell him what I want
It seems to be a kind of habit in these here parts tonightIm getting homesick fur Illinoise
But Ill take a chancet
He wont shoot says Bud if yo go about it right
Beauregard aint going to be asleep with all this going on in town tonight
Yo rattle on the iron gate and hell holler to know what yo all want
If he dont shoot first I says
When he hollers yo cry back at him yo have found his OLD DEAD HOSS in the road
It wont hurt to holler that loud and that will make him let you within talking distance
His old DEAD HOSS
Yo dont need to know what that is
HE will
And then Bud told me enough of the signs and words to say and things to do to keep Beaure gard from shootinghe said he reckoned he had trusted me so much he might as well go the hull hog
Beauregard he says belongs to them riders too they have friends in all the towns that watches the lay of the land fur them he says
I made a long halfcircle around them burning buildings keeping in the dark fur people was coming out in bunches now that it was all over with watching them fires burning and talking excited and saying the riders should be follered only not follering
I found the house Bud meant and they was a light in the secondstory window
I rattled on the gate
A dog barked somewheres near but I hearn his chain jangle and knowed he was fast and I rattled on the gate agin
The light moved away from the window
Then another front window opened quiet and a voice says Doctor is that yo back agin
No I says I aint a doctor
Stay where you are then
I GOT YOU COVERED
I am staying I says dont shoot
Who are yo
A feller I says kind of sensing his gun through the darkness as I spoke who has found your OLD DEAD HOSS in the road
He didnt answer fur several minutes
Then he says using the words DEAD HOSS as Bud had said he would
A DEAD HOSS is fitten fo nothing but to skin
Well I says using the words fur the third time as instructed it is a DEAD HOSS all right
I hearn the window shut and purty soon the front door opened
Come up here he says
I come
Who rode that hoss yo been talking about
he asts
One of the SILENT BRIGADE I tells him as Bud had told me to say
I give him the grip Bud had showed me with his good hand
Come on in he says
He shut the door behind us and lighted a lamp agin
And we looked each other over
He was a scrawny little feller with little gray eyes set near together and some sandycomplected whiskers on his chin
I told him about Bud and what his fix was
Damn itoh damn it all he says rubbing the bridge of his nose I dont see how on AIRTH I kin do it
My wifes jest had a baby
Do yo hear that
And I did hear a sound like kittens mewing somewheres up stairs
Beauregard he grinned and rubbed his nose some more and looked at me like he thought that mewing noise was the smartest sound that ever was made
Boy he says grinning bon five hours ago
Ive done named him Burleyafter the tobaccer association yo know
Yes SIR Burley Peoples is his nameand he shore kin squall the derned little cuss
Yes I says you better stay with Burley
Lend me a rig of some sort and Ill take Bud home
So we went out to Beauregards stable with a lantern and hitched up one of his hosses to a light road wagon
He went into the house and come back agin with a mattress fur Bud to lie on and a part of a bottle of whiskey
And I drove back to that lumber pile
I guess I nearly killed Bud getting him into there
But he wasnt bleeding much from his hipit was his arm was giving him fits
We went slow and the dawn broke with us four miles out of town
It was broad daylight and early morning noises stirring everywheres when we drove up in front of an old farmhouse with big brick chimbleys built on the outside of it a couple of miles farther on
CHAPTER XIV As I drove into the yard a bareheaded old nigger with a game leg throwed down an armful of wood he was gathering and went limping up to the veranda as fast as he could
He opened the door and bawled out pointing to us before he had it fairly open O Marse WILLyum
O Miss LUCY
Deyve brung him home
DAR he
A little bright blackeyed old lady like a wren comes running out of the house and chirps O BudO my honey boy
Is he dead
I reckon not Miss Lucy says Bud raising himself up on the mattress as she runs up to the wagon and trying to act like everything was all a joke
She was jest high enough to kiss him over the edge of the wagon box
A worriedlooking old gentleman come out the door seen Bud and his mother kissing each other and then says to the old nigger man George yo old fool what do yo mean by shouting out like that
Marse Willyum begins George explaining
Shut up says the old gentleman very quiet
Take the bay mare and go for Doctor Poter
Then he comes to the wagon and says So they got yo Bud
Yo WOULD go night riding like a rowdy and a thug
Are yo much hurt
He said it easy and gentle more than mad
But Bud he flushed up pale as he was and didnt answer his dad direct
He turned to his mother and said Miss Lucy dear it would a done yo heart good to see the way them trust warehouses blazed up
And the old lady smiling and crying both to oncet says God bless her brave boy
But the old gentleman looked mighty serious and his worry settled into a frown between his eyes and he turns to me and says Yo must pardon us sir fo neglecting to thank yo sooner
I told him that would be all right fur him not to worry none
And him and me and Mandy which was the nigger cook got Bud into the house and into his bed
And his mother gets that busy ordering Mandy and the old gentleman around to get things and fix things and make Bud as easy as she could that you could see she was one of them kind of woman that gets a lot of satisfaction out of having some one sick to fuss over
And after quite a while George gets back with Doctor Porter
He sets Buds arm and he locates the bullet in him and he says he guesses hell do in a few weeks if nothing like blood poisoning nor gangrene nor inflammation sets in
Only the doctor says he reckons instead of he guesses which they all do down there
And they all had them easygoing waitabit kind of voices and didnt see no perticler importance in their rs
It wasnt that you could spell it no different when they talked but it sounded different
I eat my breakfast with the old gentleman and then I took a sleep until time fur dinner
They wouldnt hear of me leaving that night
I fully intended to go on the next day but before I knowed it I been there a couple of days and have got very well acquainted with that fambly
Well that was a house divided agin itself
Miss Lucy she is awful favourable to all this night rider business
She spunks up and her eyes sparkles whenever she thinks about that there tobaccer trust
She would of like to been a nightrider herself
But the old man he says law and order is the main pint
What the country needs he says aint burning down tobaccer warehouses and shooting your neighbours and licking them with switches fur no wrong done never righted another wrong
But you were in the Ku Klux Klan yoself says Miss Lucy
The old man says the Ku Kluxes was working fur a principlethe principle of keeping the white supremacy on top of the nigger race
Fur if you let em quit work and go around balloting and voting it wont do
It makes em biggity
And a biggity nigger is laying up trouble fur himself
Because sooner or later he will get to thinking he is as good as one of these here AngleSaxtons you are always hearing so much talk about down South
And if the AngleSaxtons was to stand fur that purty soon they would be sociable equality
And next the hull dern country would be niggerized
Them there AngleSaxtons that come over from Ireland and Scotland and France and the Great British Islands and settled up the South jest simply couldnt afford to let that happen he says and so they Ku Kluxed the niggers to make em quit voting
It was THEIR job to MAKE law and order he says which they couldnt be with niggers getting the idea they had a right to govern
So they Ku Kluxed em like gentlemen
But these here nightriders he says is AGIN law and orderthey can shoot up more law and order in one night than can be manu factured agin in ten years
He was a very quiet peaceable old man Mr Davis was and Bud says he was so dern foolish about law and order he had to up and shoot a man about fifteen years ago who hearn him talking thataway and said he reminded him of a Boston school teacher
But Miss Lucy and Bud they tells me what all them nightridings is fur
It seems this here to baccer trust is jest as mean and lowdown and un principled as all the rest of them trusts
The farm ers around there raised considerable tobaccer moren they did of anything else
The trust had shoved the price so low they couldnt hardly make a living
So they organized and said they would all hold their tobaccer fur a fair price
But some of the farmers wouldnt organizesaid they had a right to do what they pleased with their own to baccer
So the nightriders was formed to burn their barns and ruin their crops and whip em and shoot em and make em jine
And also to burn a few trust warehouses now and then and show em this free American people composed mainly out of the AngleSaxton races wasnt going to take no sass from anybody
An old feller by the name of Rufe Daniels who wouldnt jine the nightriders had been shot to death on his own door step jest about a mile away only a week or so before
The nightriders mostly used these here automatic shotguns but they didnt bother with birdshot
They mostly loaded their shells with buckshot
A few bicycle ball bearings dropped out of old Rufe when they gathered him up and got him into shape to plant
They is always some lowdown cuss in every crowd that carries things to the point where they get brutal Bud says and he feels like them bicycle bearings was going a little too fur though he wouldnt let on to his dad that he felt thataway
So fur as I could see they hadnt hurt the trust none to speak of them nightriders
But they had done considerable damage to their own county fur folks was moving away and the price of land had fell
Still I guess they must of got considerable satisfaction out of raising the deuce nights thata way and sometimes that is worth a hull lot to a feller
As fur as I could make out both the trust and the nightriders was in the wrong
But you take em one at a time personallike and not into a gang and most of them nightriders is gooddis positioned folks
I never knowed any trusts per sonal but mebby if you could ketch em the same way they would be similar
I asts George one day what he thought about it
George he got mighty serious right off like he felt his answer was going to be used to decide the hull thing by
He was carrying a lot of scraps on a plate to a hound dog that had a kennel out near Georges cabin and he walled his eyes right thought ful and scratched his head with the fork he had been scraping the plate with but fur a while nothing come of it
Finally George says Ise spec mah jedgment des about de same as Marse WILLyums an Miss LUCYs
Ise notice hit mos inginlly am de same
That cant be George says I fur they think different ways
Den if DAT am de case says George dey aint NO ONE kin settle hit twell hit settles hitsef

And dey was mo gwinesON

George he begins to chuckle and I ast him how
Yass SAH dat settle HITsef
But I spec Miss Lucy Buckner done hep some in de settleMENT
Foh de day befoh de weddin was gwine ter be she ups an she runs off wid a Yankee frien of her brother Kunnel Tom Buckner
An Ise spec Kunnel Tom an Marse Prent McMakin would o settle HIM ef dey evah had o cotched him dat dar David Ahmstrong
Who
says I
David Ahmstrong was his entitlement says George an he been gwine to de same college as Marse Tom Buckner up noth somewhah
Dats howcome he been visitin Marse Tom des befoh de weddin trouble done settle HIT sef data way
Well it give me quite a turn to run onto the mention of that there David Armstrong agin in this part of the country
Here he had been jilting Miss Hampton way up in Indiany and running away with another girl down here in Tennessee
Then it struck me mebby it is jest different parts of the same story I been hearing of and Martha had got her part a little wrong
George I says what did you say Miss Lucy Buckners grandads name was
Kunnel Hamptondes de same as MY Miss Lucy befo SHE done mahied Marse Willyum
That made me sure of it
It was the same woman
She had run away with David Armstrong from this here same neighbourhood
Then after he got her up North he had left heror her left him
And then she wasnt Miss Buckner no longer
And she was mad and wouldnt call herself Mrs Armstrong
So she moved away from where any one was lible to trace her to and took her mothers maiden name which was Hampton
Well I says what ever become of em after they run off George
But George has told about all he knows
They went North according to what everybody thinks he says
Prent McMakin he follered and hunted
And Col Tom Buckner he done the same
Fur about a year Colonel Tom he was always making trips away from there to the North
But whether he ever got any track of his sister and that David Armstrong nobody knowed
Nobody never asked him
Old Colonel Hampton he grieved and he grieved and not long after the runaway he up and died
And Tom Buckner he finally sold all he owned in that part of the country and moved further south
George said he didnt rightly know whether it was Alabama or Florida
Or it might of been Georgia
I thinks to myself that mebby Mrs Davis would like to know where her niece is and that I better tell her about Miss Hampton being in that there little Indiany town and where it is
And then I thinks to myself I better not butt in
Fur Miss Hampton has likely got her own reasons fur keeping away from her folks or else she wouldnt do it
Anyhow its none of MY affair to bring the subject up to em
It looks to me like one of them things George has been gassing aboutone of them things that has settled itself and it aint fur me to meddle and unsettle it
It set me to thinking about Martha too
Not that I hadnt thought of her lots of times
I had often thought I would write her
But I kept putting it off and purty soon I kind of forgot Martha
I had seen a lot of different girls of all kinds since I had seen Martha
Yet whenever I happened to think of Martha I had always liked her best
Only moving around the country so much makes it kind of hard to keep thinking steady of the same girl
Besides I had lost that there half of a ring too
But knowing what I did now about Miss Hampton being Miss Buckneror Mrs Armstrongand related to these Davises made me want to get away from there
Fur that secret made me feel kind of sneaking like I wasnt being frank and open with them
Yet if I had of told em I would of felt sneakinger yet fur giving Miss Hampton away
I never got into a mix up thataway betwixt my conscience and my duty but what it made me feel awful uncomfortable
So I guessed I would light out from there
They wasnt never no kinder better people than them Davises either
They was so pleased with my bringing Bud home the night he was shot they would of jest natcherally give me half their farm if I had of ast them fur it
They wanted me to stay therethey didnt say fur how long and I guess they didnt give a dern
But I was in a sweat to ketch up with Doctor Kirby agin
CHAPTER XV I made purty good time and in a couple of days I was in Atlanta
I knowed the doctor must of gone back into some branch of the medicine gamethe bottles told me that
I knowed it must be something that he needed some special kind of bottles fur too or he wouldnt of had them shipped all that distance but would of bought them nearer
I seen I was a dern fool fur rushing off and not inquiring what kind of bottles so I could trace what he was into easier
Its hard work looking fur a man in a goodsized town
I hung around hotel lobbies and places till I was tired of it thinking he might come in
And I looked through all the office buildings and read all the advertisements in the papers
Then the second day I was there the state fair started up and I went out to it
I run acrost a couple I knowed out there the first thingit was Watty and the snakecharmer woman
Only she wasnt charming them now
Her and Watty had a Parisian Models show
I ast Watty where Dolly was
He says he dont know that Dolly has quit him
By which I guess he means he has quit her
I ast where Reginald is and the Human Ostrich
But from the way they answered my questions I seen I wasnt welcome none around there
I suppose that Mrs Ostrich and Watty had met up agin somewheres and had jest natcherally run off with each other and left their famblies
Like as not she had left poor old Reginald with that idiotic ostrich feller to sell to strangers that didnt know his disposition
Or mebby by now Reginald was turned loose in the open country to shift fur himself among wild snakes that never had no human education nor experience and what chancet would a friendly snake like Reginald have in a gang like that
Some women has jest simply got no conscience at all about their husbands and famblies and that there Mrs Ostrich was one of em
Well a feller can be a derned fool sometimes
Fur all my looking around I wasted a lot of time before I thought of going to the one natcheral placethe freight depot of the road them bottles had been shipped by
I had lost a week coming down
But freight often loses more time than that
And it was at the freight depot that I found him
Tickled
Well yes
Both of us
Well by George says he youre good for sore eyes
Before he told me how he happened not to of drownded or blowed away or anything he says we better fix up a bit
Which he meant I better
So he buys me duds from head to heel and we goes to a Turkish bath place and I puts em on
And then we goes and eats
Hearty
Now he says Fido Cutup how did you find me
 I told him about the bottles
A dead loss those bottles he says
I wanted some nonrefillable ones for a little scheme I had in mind and I had to get them at a certain place and now the schemes up in the air and I cant use em
The doctor had changed some in looks in the year or more that had passed since I saw him floating away in that balloon
And not fur the better
He told me how he had blowed clean acrost Lake Erie in that there balloon
And then when he got over land agin and went to pull the cord that lets the parachute loose it wouldnt work at first
He jest natcherally drifted on into the midst of nowhere he saidmiles and miles into Canada
When he lit the balloon had lost so much gas and was flying so low that the parachute didnt open out quick enough to do much floating
So he lit hard and come near being knocked out fur good
But  AUTHORS NOTECan it be that Danny struggles vaguely to report some reference to FIDUS ACHATES
that wasnt the worst of it fur the exposure had crawled into his lungs by the time he found a house and he got newmonia into them also and like to of died
Whilst I was laying sick he had been sick also only hisn lasted much longer
But he tells me he has jest struck an idea fur a big scheme
No little schemes go fur him any more he says
He wants money
Real money
How you going to get it
I asts him
Come along and Ill tell you he says
Well take a walk and Ill show you how I got my idea
We left the restaurant and went along the brag street of that town which it is awful proud of past where the stores stops and the houses begins
We come to a finelooking house on a cornera swell place it was with lots of palms and ferns and plants setting on the verandah and showing through the windows
And stables back of it and back of the stables a big yard with noises coming from it like they was circus animals there
Which I found out later they really was kept fur pets
You could tell the people that lived there had money
This says Doctor Kirby as we walked by is the house that Jackson built
Dr Julius Jack sonOLD Doctor Jackson the man with an idea
The idea made all the money you smell around here
What idea
The ideathe glorious humanitarian and philanthropic ideaof taking the kinks and curls out of the hair of the AfroAmerican brother says Doctor Kirby at so much per kink
This Doctor Jackson he says sells what he calls AntiCurl to the niggers
It is to straighten out their hair so it will look like white peoples hair
They is millions and millions of niggers and every nigger has millions and millions of kinks and so Doctor Jackson has got rich at it
So rich he can afford to keep that there personal circus menagerie in his back yard for his little boy to play with and many other interesting things
He must be worth two three million dollars Doctor Kirby says and still amaking it with more niggers growing up all the time fur to have their hair un kinked
Especially mulattoes and yaller niggers
Doctor Kirby says thinking what a great idea that AntiCurl was give him his own great idea
They is a gold mine there he says and Dr Julius Jackson has only scratched a little off the top of it but HE is going to dig deeper
Why is it that the AfroAmerican brother buys AntiCurl
he asts
Why
I asts
Because he says he wants to be as much like a white man as he possibly can
He strives to burst his births invidious bar Danny
They talk about progress and education for the Afro American brother and uplift and advancement and industrial education and manual training and all that sort of thing
Especially we Northerners
But what the AfroAmerican brother thinks about and dreams about and longs for and prays to bewhen he thinks at allis to be white
Education to his mind is learning to talk like a white man
Progress means aping the white man
Religion is dying and going to heaven and being a WHITE angellisten to his prayers and sermons and youll find that out
Hell do anything he can or give anything he can get his Ethiopian grub hooks on for something that he thinks is going to make him more like a white man
Poor devil
Therefore the millions of Doctor Jackson Anti Curl
All this Doctor Jackson AntiCurl has dis covered and thought out and acted upon
If he had gone just one step farther the AfroAmerican brother would have hailed him as a greater man than Abraham Lincoln or either of the Washing tons George or Booker
It remains for me Dannyfor USto carry the torch aheadto take up the work where the imagination of Doctor Jackson AntiCurl has laid it down
How
asts I
WELL PUT UP AND SELL A PREPARATION TO TURN THE NEGROES WHITE
THAT was his great idea
He was more excited over it than I ever seen him before about anything
It sounded like so easy a way to get rich it made me wonder why no one had ever done it before if it could really be worked
I didnt believe much it could be worked
But Doctor Kirby he says he has begun his experiments already with arsenic
Arsenic he says will bleach anything
Only he is kind of afraid of arsenic too
If he could only get hold of something that didnt cost much and that would whiten them up fur a little while he says it wouldnt make no difference if they did get black agin
This here AntiCurl stuff works like thatit takes the kinks out fur a little while and they come back agin
But that dont seem to hurt the sale none
It only calls fur MORE of Doctor Jacksons medicine
The doctor takes me around to the place he boards at and shows me a nigger waiter he has been ex perimenting on
He had paid the niggers fine in a police court fur slashing another nigger some with a knife and kept him from going into the chain gang
So the nigger agreed he could use his hide to try different kinds of medicines on
He was a velvetylooking chocolatecoloured kind of nigger to start with and the best Doctor Kirby had been able to do so fur was to make a few little liver coloured spots come onto him
But it was making the nigger sick and the doctor was afraid to go too fur with it fur Sam might die and we would be at the expense of another nigger
Peroxide of hidergin hadnt even phased him
Nor a lot of other things we tried onto him
You never seen a nigger with his colour running into him so deep as Sams did
Sam he was always apologizing about it too
You could see it made him feel real bad to think his colour was so stubborn
He felt like it wasnt being polite to the doctor and me Sam did fur his skin to act thataway
He was a willing nigger Sam was
The doctor he says he will find out the right stuff if he has to start at the letter A and work Sam through every drug in the hull blame alphabet down to Z
Which he finally struck it
I dont exactly know what she had in her but she was a mixture of some kind
The only trouble with her was she didnt work equal and evenleft Sams face looking peeled and spotty in places
But still in them spots Sam was six shades lighter
The doctor says that is jest what he wants that there passing ontothenextcagewehavethespottedgirocutus look as he calls it
The chocolate brown and the lighter spots side by side he says made a regular Before and After out of Sams face and was the best advertisement you could have
Then we goes and has a talk with Doctor Jackson himself
Doctor Kirby has the idea mebby he will put some money into it
Doctor Jackson was setting on his front veranda with his chair tilted back and his feet with red carpet slippers on em was on the railing and he was smoking one of these long black cigars that comes each one in a little glass tube all by itself
He looks Sam over very thoughtful and he says Yes it will do the work well enough
I can see that
But will it sell
Doctor Kirby makes him quite a speech
I never hearn him make a better one
Doctor Jackson he listens very calm with his thumbs in the armholes of his vest and moving his eyebrows up and down like he enjoyed it
But he dont get excited none
Finally Doctor Kirby says he will undertake to show that it will sellme and him will take a trip down into the black country ourselves and show what can be done with it and take Sam along fur an object lesson
Well they was a lot of ragchewing
Doctor Jackson dont warm up none and he asts a million questions
Like how much it costs a bottle to make it and what was our idea how much it orter sell fur
He says finally if we can sell a certain number of bottles in so long a time he will put some money into it
Only he says they will be a stock company and he will have to have fiftyone per cent
of the stock or he wont put no money into it
He says if things go well he will let Doctor Kirby be manager of that company and let him have some stock in it too and he will be president and treasurer of it himself
Doctor Kirby he didnt like that and said so
Said HE was going to organize that stock company and control it himself
But Doctor Jackson said he never put money into nothing he couldnt run
So it was settled we would give the stuff a tryout and report to him
Before we went away from there it looked to me like Doctor Kirby and me was going to work fur this here Doctor Jackson instead of making all them there millions fur ourselves
Which I didnt take much to that AntiCurl man myself he was so coldblooded like
I didnt like the scheme itself any too well neither
Not any way you could look at it
In the first place it seemed like a mean trick on the niggers
Then I didnt much believe we could get away with it
The more I looked him over the more I seen Doctor Kirby had changed considerable
When I first knowed him he liked to hear himself talking and he liked to live free and easy and he liked to be running around the country and all them things moren he liked to be making money
Of course he wanted it but that wasnt the ONLY thing he was into the Sagraw game fur
If he had money he was free with it and would help most any one out of a hole
But he wasnt thinking it and talking it all the time then
But now he was thinking money and dream ing money and talking of nothing but how to get it
And planning to make it out of skinning them niggers
He didnt care a dern how he worked on their feelings to get it
He didnt even seem to care whether he killed Sam trying them drugs onto him
He wanted MONEY and he wanted it so bad he was ready and willing to take up with most any wild scheme to make it
They was something about him now that didnt fit in much with the Doctor Kirby I had knowed
It seemed like he had spells when he saw himself how he had changed
He wasnt gay and joking all the time like he had been before neither
I guess the doctor was getting along toward fifty years old
I suppose he thought if he was ever going to get anything out of his gift of the gab he better settle down to something and quit fooling around and do it right away
But it looked to me like he might never turn the trick
Fur he was drinking right smart all the time
Drinking made him think a lot and thinking was making him look old
He was moren one year older than he had been a year ago
He kept a quart bottle in his room now
The night after we had took Sam to see Doctor Jackson we was setting in his room and he was hitting it purty hard
Danny he says to me after a while like he was talking out loud to himself too what did you think of Doctor Jackson
I dont like him much I says
Nor I he says frowning and takes a drink
Then he says after quite a few minutes of frowning and thinking under his breath like Hes a blame sight more decent than I am for all of that
Why
I asts him
Because Doctor Jackson he says hasnt the least idea that he ISNT decent and getting his money in a decent way
While at one time I was He breaks off and dont say what he was
I asts him
I was going to say a gentleman he says but on reflection I doubt if I was ever anything but a cheap imitation
I never heard a man say that he was a gentleman at one time that I didnt doubt him
Also he goes on work ing himself into a better humour again with the sound of his own voice if I HAD ever been a gentle man at any time enough of it would surely have stuck to me to keep me out of partnership with a man who cheats niggers
He takes another drink and says even twenty years of running around the country couldnt of took all the gentleman out of him like this if he had ever been one fur you can break you can scatter the vase if you will but the smell of the roses will stick round it still
I seen now the kind of conversations he is always having with himself when he gets jest so drunk and is thinking hard
Only this time it happens to be out loud
What is a gentleman
I asts him thinking if he wasnt one it might take his mind off himself a little to tell me
What MAKES one
Authorities differ says Doctor Kirby slouching down in his chair and grinning like he knowed a joke he wasnt going to tell no one
I heard Doctor Jackson describe himself that way the other day
Well speaking personal I never had smelled none of roses
I wasnt nothing but trash myself so being a gentleman didnt bother me one way or the other
The only reason I didnt want to see them niggers bunked so very bad was only jest because it was such a lowdown ornery kind of trick
It aint too late I says to pull out of this nigger scheme yet and get into something more honest
I dont know he says thoughtful
I think perhaps it IS too late
And he sets there looking like a man that is going over a good many years of life in his mind
Purty soon he says As far as honesty goesit isnt that so much O Danielcometojudgment
Its about as honest as most medicine games
Its He stopped and frowned agin
What is it
Its their being NIGGERS he says
That made the difference fur me too
I dunno how nor why
Ive tried nearly everything but blackmail he says and Ill probably be trying that by this time next year if this scheme fails
But theres something about their being niggers that makes me sick of this thing alreadyjust as the time has come to make the start
And I dont know WHY it should either
He slipped another big slug of whiskey into him and purty soon he asts me Do you know whats the matter with me
I asts him what
Im too decent to be a crook he says and too crooked to be decent
Youve got to be one thing or the other steady to make it pay
Then he says Did you ever hear of the descent to Avernus Danny
I might I tells him and then agin I mightnt but if I ever did I dont remember what she is
What is she
Its the chute to the infernal regions he says
They say its greased
But it isnt
Its really no easier sliding down than it is climbing back
Well I seen this nigger scheme of ourn wasnt the only thing that was troubling Doctor Kirby that night
It was thinking of all the schemes like it in the years past he had went into and how he had went into em lighthearted and moren half fur fun when he was a young man and now he wasnt fitten fur nothing else but them kind of schemes and he knowed it
He was seeing himself how he had been changing like another person could of seen it
Thats the main trouble with drinking to fergit yourself
You fergit the wrong part of yourself
I left him purty soon and went along to bed
My room was next to hisn and they was a door between so the two could be rented together if wanted I suppose
I went to sleep and woke up agin with a start out of a dream that had in it millions and millions and millions of niggers every way you looked and their mouths was all open red and their eyes walled white fit to scare you out of your shoes
I hearn Doctor Kirby moving around in his room
But purty soon he sets down and begins to talk to himself
Everything else was quiet
I was kind of worried about him he had taken so much and hoped he wouldnt get a notion to go downtown that time o night
So I thinks I will see how he is acting and steps over to the door be tween the rooms
The key happened to be on my side and I un locked it
But she only opens a little ways fur his wash stand was near to the hinge end of the door
I looked through
He is setting by the table looking at a womans picture that is propped up on it and talking to himself
He has never hearn me open the door he is so interested
But somehow he dont look drunk
He looks like he had fought his way up out of it somehowhis forehead was sweaty and they was one intoxicated lock of hair sticking to it but that was the only unsober looking thing about him
I guess his legs would of been unsteady if he had of tried to walk but his intellects was uncomfortable and sober
He is still keeping up that same old argument with himself or with the picture
It isnt any use I hearn him say looking at the picture
Then he listened like he hearn it answering him
Yes you always say just thatjust that he says
And I dont know why I keep on listening to you
The way he talked and harkened fur an answer when they was nothing there to answer give me the creeps
You dont help me he goes on you dont help me at all
You only make it harder
Yes this thing is worse than the others
I know that
But I want moneyand fool things like this HAVE sometimes made it
No I wont give it up
No theres no use making any more promises now
I know myself now
And you ought to know me by this time too
Why cant you let me alone altogether
I should think when you see what I am youd let me be
God help you
if youd only stay away it wouldnt be so hard to go to hell
CHAPTER XVI Theres a lot of counties in Georgia where the blacks are equal in number to the whites and two or three counties where the blacks number over the whites by two to one
It was fur a little town in one of the latter that we pinted ourselves Doctor Kirby and me and Sam right into the blackest part of the black belt
That country is full of bigsized plantations where they raise cotton cotton cotton and then MORE cotton
Some of em raises fruit too and other things of course but cotton is the main standby and it looks like it always will be
Some places there shows that things cant be so awful much changed since slavery days and most of the niggers are sure enough country niggers yet
Some rents their land right out from the owners and some of em crops it on the shares and very many of em jest works as hands
A lot of em dont do nigh so well now as they did when their bosses was their masters they tell me and then agin some has done right well on their own hook
They intrusted me because I never had been use to looking at so many niggers
Every way you turn there they is niggers and then more niggers
Them that thinks they is awful easy to handle out of a natcheral respect fur white folks has got another guess coming
They aint so bad to get along with if you keep it most pintedly shoved into their heads they IS niggers
You got to do that especial in the black belt jest because they IS so many of em
They is children all their lives mebby till some one minute of craziness may strike one of them and then he is a devil temporary
Mebby when the crazy fit has passed some white woman is worse off than if she was dead or mebby she IS dead or mebby a loonatic fur life and that nigger is a candidate fur a lynching bee and ginerally elected by an anonymous majority
Not that ALL niggers is thataway nor HALF of em nor very MANY of em evenbut you can never tell WHICH nigger is going to be
So in the black belt the white folks is mighty perticler who comes along fooling with their niggers
Fur you can never tell what turn a niggers thoughts will take once anything at all stirs em up
We didnt know them things then Doctor Kirby and me didnt
We didnt know we was moving lighthearted right into the middle of the biggest question that has ever been ast
Which I disre member exactly how that nigger question is worded but they is always asting it in the South and an swering of it different ways
We hadnt no idea how suspicious the white people in them awful black spots on the map can get over any one that comes along talking to their niggers
We didnt know anything about niggers much being both from the North except what Doctor Kirby had counted on when he made his medicine and THAT he knowed secondhanded from other people
We didnt take em very serious nor all the talk we hearn about em down South
But even at that we mightnt of got into any trouble if it hadnt of been fur old Bishop Warren
But that is getting ahead of the story
We got into that little townI might jest as well call it Cottonvillejest about supper time
Cottonville is a little place of not moren six hundred people
I guess four hundred of em must be niggers
After supper we got acquainted with purty nigh all the prominent citizens in town
They was friendly with us and we was friendly with them
Georgia had jest went fur prohibition a few months before that and they hadnt opened up these here nearbeer barrooms in the little towns yet like they had in Atlanta and the big towns
Georgia had went prohibition so the niggers couldnt get whiskey some said but others said they didnt know WHAT its excuse was
Them prominent citizens was loafing around the hotel and every now and then inviting each other very mysterious into a back room that use to be a pool parlour
They had been several jugs come to town by express that day
We went back several times ourselves and soon began to get along purty well with them prominent citizens
Talking about this and that they finally edges around to the one thing everybody is sure to get to talking about sooner or later in the South niggers
And then they gets to telling us about this here Bishop Warren I has mentioned
He was a nigger bishop Bishop Warren was and had a good deal of white blood into him they say
An ashycoloured nigger with bumps on his face fat as a possum and as cunning as a fox
He had plenty of brains into his head too but his brains had turned sour in his head the last few years and the bishop had crazy streaks running through his sense now like fat and lean mixed in a slab of bacon
He used to be friends with a lot of big white folks and the whites depended on him at one time to preach orderliness and obedience and agriculture and being in their place to the niggers
Fur years they thought he preached thataway
He always DID preach thataway when any whites was around and he set on platforms sometimes with white preachers and he got good donations fur schemes of different kinds
But gradual the suspicion got around that when he was alone with a lot of niggers his nigger blood would get the best of him and what he preached wasnt white su premacy at all but hopefulness of being equal
So the whites had fell away from him and then his graft was gone and then his brains turned sour in his head and got to working and fermenting in it like cider getting hard and he made a few bad breaks by not being careful what he said before white people
But the niggers liked him all the better fur that
They always had been more or less hell in the bishops heart
He had brains and he knowed it and the white folks had let him see THEY knowed it too
And he was part white and his white forefathers had been big men in their day and yet in spite of all of that he had to herd with niggers and to pertend he liked it
He was both white and black in his feelings about things so some of his feelings counterdicted others and one of these here race riots went on all the time in his own insides
But gradual he got to the place where they was spells he hated both whites and niggers but he hated the whites the worst
And now in the last two or three years since his crazy streaks had growed as big as his sensible streaks or bigger they was no telling what he would preach to them niggers
But whatever he preached most of them would believe
It might be something crazy and harmless or it might be crazy and harmful
He had been holding some revival meetings in nigger churches right there in that very county and was at it not fur away from there right then
The idea had got around he was preaching some most unusual foolishness to the blacks
Fur the niggers was all acting like they knowed something too good to mention to the white folks all about there
But some white men had gone to one of the meetings and the bishop had preached one of his oldtime sermons whilst they was there telling the niggers to be orderly and agriculturoushe was considerable of a fox yet
But he and the rest of the niggers was so DERNED anxious to be thought agriculturous and servitudinous that the whites smelt a rat and wished he would go fur they didnt want to chase him without they had to
Jest when we was getting along fine one of them prominent citizens asts the doctor was we there figgering on buying some land
No says the doctor we wasnt
They was silence fur quite a little spell
Each prominent citizen had mebby had his hopes of unloading some
They all looks a little sad and then another prominent citizen asts us into the back room agin
When we returns to the front room another promi nent citizen makes a little speech that was quite beautiful to hear and says mebby we represents some new concern that aint never been in them parts and is figgering on buying cotton
No the doctor says we aint cotton buyers
Another prominent citizen has the idea mebby we is figgering on one of these here interReuben trolley lines so the Rubes in one village can ride over and visit the Rubes in the next
And another one thinks mebby we is figgering on a telephone line
And each one makes a very eloquent little speech about them things and rings in something about our fair Southland
And when both of them misses their guess it is time fur another visit to the back room
Was we selling something
We was
Was we selling fruit trees
We wasnt
Finally after every one has a chew of natcheral leaf tobaccer all around one prominent citizen makes so bold as to ast us very courteous if he might enquire what it was we was selling
The doctor says medicine
Then they was a slow grin went around that there crowd of prominent citizens
And once agin we has to make a trip to that back room
Fur they are all sure we must be taking orders fur something to beat that there prohibition game
When they misses that guess they all gets kind of thoughtful and sad
A couple of em dont take no more interest in us but goes along home sighinglike as if it wasnt no difference WHAT we sold as long as it wasnt what they was looking fur
But purty soon one of them asts What KIND of medicine
The doctor he tells about it
When he finishes you never seen such a change as had come onto the faces of that bunch
I never seen such disgusted prominent citizens in my hull life
They looked at each other embarrassed like they had been ketched at something ornery
And they went out one at a time saying good night to the hotelkeeper and in the most pinted way taking no notice of us at all
It certainly was a chill
We sees something is wrong and we begins to have a notion of what it is
The hotelkeeper he spits out his chew and goes behind his little counter and takes a fivecent cigar out of his little show case and bites the end off careful
Then he leans his elbows onto his counter and reads our names to himself out of the register book and looks at us and from us to the names and from the names to us like he is trying to figger out how he come to let us write em there
Then he wants to know where we come from before we come to Atlanta where we had registered from
We tells him we is from the North
He lights his cigar like he didnt think much of that cigar and sticks it in his mouth and looks at us so long in an absentminded kind of way it goes out
Then he says we orter go back North
Why
asts the doctor
He chewed his cigar purty nigh up to the middle of it before he answered and when he spoke it was a soft kind of a drawlnot mad or loudbut like they was sorrowful thoughts working in him
Yo all done struck the wost paht o the South to peddle yo niggah medicine in sah
I reckon yo must love em a heap to be that concehned over the colour of their skins
And he turned his back on us and went into the back room all by himself
We seen we was in wrong in that town
The doctor says it will be no use trying to interduce our stuff there and we might as well leave there in the morning and go over to Bairdstown which was a little place about ten miles off the railroad and make our start there
So we got a rig the next morning and drove acrost the country
No one bid us goodbye neither and Doctor Kirby says its a wonder they rented us the rig
But before we started that morning we noticed a funny thing
We hadnt so much as spoke to any nigger except our own nigger Sam and he couldnt of told ALL the niggers in that town about the stuff to turn niggers white even if he had set up all night to do it
But every last nigger we saw looked like he knowed something about us
Even after we left town our nigger driver hailed two or three niggers in the road that acted thata way
It seemed like they was all awful polite to us
And yet they was different in their politeness than they was to them Georgia folks which is their natcheralborn bossesacted more familiar some how as if they knowed we must be thinking about the same thing they was thinking about
About halfway to Bairdstown we stopped at a place to get a drink of water
Seemingly the white folks was away fur the day and an old nigger come up and talked to our driver while Sam and us was at the well
I seen them cutting their eyes at us whilst they was unchecking the hosses to let them drink too and then I hearn the one that belonged there say Is yo SUAH dat hit air dem
SUAH
says the driver
Howcome yo so allpowerful SUAH about hit
The driver pertended the harness needed some fixing and they went around to the other side of the team and tinkered with one of the traces atalking to each other
I hearn the old nigger say kind of wonderized Is dey agwine dar NOW
Sam he was pulling a bucket of water up out of the well fur us with a windlass
The doctor says to him Sam what does all this mean
Sam he pertends he dont know what the doctor is talking about
But Doctor Kirby he finally pins him down
Sam hemmed and hawed considera ble making up his mind whether he better lie to us or not
Then all of a sudden he busted out into an awful fit of laughing and like to of fell in the well
Seemingly he decided fur to tell us the truth
From what Sam says that there bishop has been holding revival meetings in Big Bethel which is a nigger church right on the edge of Bairdstown and niggers fur miles around has been coming night after night and some of them whooping her up daytimes too
And the bishop has worked himself up the last three or four nights to where he has been perdicting and prophesying fur the spirit has hit the meeting hard
What he has been prophesying Sam says is the coming of a Messiah fur the nigger racea new Elishyah he says as will lead them from outn their inequality and bring em up to white standards right on the spot
The whites has had their Messiah the bishop says but the niggers aint never had none of their SPECIAL OWN yet
And they needs one bad and one is sure acoming
It seems the whites dont know yet jest what the bishops been apreaching
But every nigger fur miles on every side of Big Bethel is alistening and alooking fur signs and omens and has been fur two three days now
This here halfcrazy bishop has got em worked up to where they is ready to believe anything or do anything
So the night before when the word got out in Cottonville that we had some scheme to make the niggers white the niggers there took up with the idea that the doctor was mebby the feller the bishop had been prophesying about and for a sign and a omen and a miracle of his grace and powers was going out to Big Bethel to turn em white
Poor devils they didnt see but what being turned white orter be a part of what they was to get from the coming of that there Messiah
News spreads among niggers quicker than among whites
No one knows how they do it
But Ive hearn tales about how when war times was there they would frequent have the news of a big fight before the white folks papers would
Soldiers has told me that in them there Philippine Islands we conquered from Spain where they is so much nigger blood mixed up with other kinds in the islanders this mysterious spreading around of news is jest the same
And jest since nine oclock the night before the news had spread fur miles around that Bishop Warrens Messiah was on his way and was going fur to turn the bishop white to show his power and grace and he had with him one he had turned part white and that was Sam and one he had turned clear white and that was me
And they was to be signs and wonders to behold at Big Bethel with pillars of cloud and sounds of trumpets and fire squirting down from heaven like it always use to be in them old Bible days and them there niggers to be led singing and shouting and rejoicing into a land of milk and honey forever more AMEN
Thats what Sam says they are looking fur dozens and scores and hundreds of them niggers round about
Sam he had lived in town five or six years and he looked down on all these here ignoramus country niggers
So he busts out laugh ing at first and he pertends like he dont take no stock in any of it
Besides he knowed well enough he wasnt spotted up by no Messiah but it was the dope in the bottles done it
But as he told about them goingson Sam got more and more interested and warmed up to it and his voice went into a kind of a singsong like he was prophesying himself
And the other two niggers quit pertending to fool around the team and edged a little closeter and a little closeter yet with their mouths open and their heads anodding and the whites of their eyes arolling
Fur my part I never hearn such a lot of dern foolishness in all my life
But the doctor he says nothing at all
He listens to Sam ranting and rolling out big words and raving and only frowns
He climbs back into the buggy agin silent and all the rest of the way to Bairdstown he set there with that scowl on his face
I guesses he was thinking now the way things had shaped up he wouldnt sell none of his stuff at all without he fell right in with the reception chance had planned fur him
But if he did fall in with it and pertend like he was a Messiah to them niggers he could get all they had
He was mebby thinking how much ornerier that would make the hull scheme
CHAPTER XVII We got to Bairdstown early enough but we didnt go to work there
We wasted all that day
They was something work ing in the doctors head he wasnt talking about
I supposed he was getting cold feet on the hull proposition
Anyhow he jest set around the little tavern in that place and done nothing all afternoon
The weather was fine and we set out in front
We hadnt set there moren an hour till I could tell we was being noticed by the blacks not out open and above board
But every now and then one or two or three would pass along down the street and lazy about and take a look at us
They pertended they wasnt noticing but they was
The word had got around and they was a feeling in the air I didnt like at all
Too much cagedup excitement among the niggers
The doctor felt it too I could see that
But neither one of us said anything about it to the other
Along toward dusk we takes a walk
They was a goodsized crick at the edge of that little place and on it an oldfashioned worter mill
Above the mill a little piece was a bridge
We crossed it and walked along a road that follered the crick bank closte fur quite a spell
It wasnt much of a townsomething betwixt a village and a settlementalthough they was going to run a branch of the railroad over to it before very long
It had had a chancet to get a railroad once years before that
But it had said then it didnt want no railroad
So until lately every branch built through that part of the country grinned very sarcastic and give it the goby
They was considerable woods standing along the crick and around a turn in the road we come onto Sam all of a sudden talking with another nigger
Sam was jest alaying it off to that nigger but he kind of hushed as we come nearer
Down the road quite a little piece was a goodsized wooden building that never had been painted and looked like it was a big barn
Without knowing it the doctor and me had been pinting ourselves right toward Big Bethel
The nigger with Sam he yells out when he sees us Glory be
HYAH dey comes
Hyah dey comes NOW
And he throwed up his arms and started on a lope up the road toward the church singing out every ten or fifteen yards
A little knot of niggers come out in front of the church when they hearn him coming
Sam he stood his ground and waited fur us to come up to him kind of apologetic and sneaking looking about something or other
What kind of lies have you been telling these niggers Sam
says the doctor very sharp and short and madlike
Sam he digs a stone outn the road with the toe of his shoe and kind of grins to himself still looking sheepish
But he says he opinionates he been telling them nothing at all
I dunno howcome dey get all dem nigger notions in dey fool haid Sam says but dey all waitin dar inside de chuch dosome of de mos faiful an de mos prarful ones o de Big Bethel conggation been dar fo de las houah awaitin an awatchin spite o de fac dat reglah meetin aint gwine ter be called twell arter supper
De bishop he dar too
Dey got some dese hyah coalile lamps dar des inside de chuch do an dey been keepin on em lighted daytimes an night times fo two days now kaze dey say dey aint gwine fo ter be cotched napping when de bridegroom COMeth

We seen a little knot of them down the road there in front of the church gathering around the nigger that had been with Sam
They all starts toward us
But one man steps out in front of them all and turns toward them and holds his hands up and waves them back
They all stops in their tracks
Then he turns his face toward us and comes slow and sollum down the road in our direction walking with a cane and moving very dignified
He was a couple of hundred yards away
But as he come closeter we gradually seen him plainer and plainer
He was a big man and stout and dressed very neat in the same kind of rig as white bishops wear with one of these white collars that buttons in the back
I suppose he was coming on to meet us alone because no one was fitten fur to give us the first welcome but himself
Well it was all dern foolishness and it was hard to believe it could all happen and they aint so many places in this here country it COULD happen
But fur all of it being foolishness when he come down the road toward us so dignified and sollum and slow I ketched myself fur a minute feeling like we really had been elected to something and was going to take office soon
And Sam as the bishop come closeter and closeter got to jerking and twitching with the excitement that he had been keeping inand yet all the time Sam knowed it was dope and works and not faith that had made him spotted thataway
He stops the bishop does about ten yards from us and looks us over
Ah yo de gennleman known ter dis hyah sinful genehation by de style an de entitlemint o Docto Hahtley Kirby
he asts the doctor very ceremoni ous and grand
The doctor give him a look that wasnt very encouraging but he nodded to him
Will yo dismiss yo sehvant in ordeh dat we kin hol convehse an communion in de midst er privacy
The doctor he nods to Sam and Sam moseys along toward the church
Now then says the doctor sudden and sharp take off your hat and tell me what you want
The bishops hand goes up to his head with a jerk before he thought
Then it stops there while him and the doctor looks at each other
The bishops mouth opens like he was wondering but he slowly pulls his hat off and stands there bareheaded in the road
But he wasnt really humble that bishop
Now says the doctor tell me in as straight talk as youve got what all this damned foolishness among you niggers means
A queer kind of look passed over the bishops face
He hadnt expected to be met jest that way mebby
Whether he himself had really believed in the coming of that there new Messiah he had been perdicting I never could settle in my mind
Mebby he had been getting ready to pass HIMSELF off fur one before we come along and the niggers all got the fool idea Doctor Kirby was it
Before the bishop spoke agin you could see his craziness and his cunningness both working in his face
But when he did speak he didnt quit being ceremonious nor dignified
De wohd has gone foth among de faiful an de puah in heaht he says dat er man has come accredited wi signs an wi mahvels an de poweh o de sperrit fo to lay his han on de sons o Ham an ter make em des de same in colluh as de yuther sons of eath
Then that word is a lie says the doctor
I DID come here to try out some stuff to change the colour of negro skins
Thats all
And I find your idiotic followers are all stirred up and waiting for some kind of a miracle monger
What you have been preaching to them you know best
Is that all you want to know
The bishop hems and haws and fiddles with his stick and then he says Suh will dish yeah prepashun SHOLY do de wohk
Doctor Kirby tells him it will do the work all right
And then the bishop after beating around the bush some more comes out with his idea
Whether he expected there would be any Messiah come or not of course he knowed the doctor wasnt him
But he is willing to boost the doctors game as long as it boosts HIS game
He wants to be in on the deal
He wants part of the graft
He wants to get together with the doctor on a plan before the doctor sees the niggers
And if the doctor dont want to keep on with the miracle end of it the bishop shows him how he could do him good with no miracle attachment
Fur he has an awful holt on them niggers and his sayso will sell thousands and thousands of bottles
What he is looking fur jest now is his little takeout
That was his craftiness and his cunningness working in him
But all of a sudden one of his crazy streaks come bulging to the surface
It come with a wild eager look in his eyes
Suh he cries out all of a sudden ef yo kin make me white fo Gawd sakes do hit
Do hit
Ef yo does I gwine ter bless yo all yo days
Yo don knowno one kin guess or comper henwhat des bein white would mean ter me
Lawd
Lawd
he says his voice softspoken but more eager than ever as he went on and plead ing something pitiful to hear des think of all de Caucasian blood in me
Gawd knows de nights er my youth Ise laid awake twell de dawn come red in de Eas acryin out ter Him only fo ter be white
DES TER BE WHITE
Don min dem black black niggers dardon think er DEMdey aint wuth nothin nor fitten fo no fate but what dey got But me
Whats done kep me from gwine ter de top but dat one thing I WASNT WHITE
Hit air too late nowtoo late fo dem ambitions I done trifle with an shove behin mehits too late fo dat
But ef I was des ter git one lil year o hitONE LIL YEAR O BEIN WHITEbefo I died And he went on like that shaking and stuttering there in the road like a fit had struck him crazy as a loon
But he got hold of himself enough to quit talking in a minute and his cunning come back to him before he was through trembling
Then the doctor says slow and even but not severe You go back to your people now bishop and tell them theyve made a mistake about me
And if you can undo the harm youve done with this Messiah business
As far as this stuff of mine is concerned theres none of it for you nor for any other negro
You tell them that
Theres none of it been sold yetand there never will be
Then we turned away and left him standing there in the road still with his hat off and his face working
Walking back toward the little tavern the doctor says Danny this is the end of this game
These people down here and that halfcracked half crooked old bishop have made me see a few things about the AfroAmerican brother
It wasnt a good scheme in the first place
And this wasnt the place to start it going anyhowI should have tried the niggers in the big towns
But Im out of it now and Im glad of it
What we want to do is to get away from here tomorrowgo back to Atlanta and fix up a scheme to rob some widows and orphans or something halfway respectable like that
Well I drew a long breath
I was with Doctor Kirby in everything he done fur he was my friend and I didnt intend to quit him
But I was glad we was out of this and hadnt sold none of that dope
We both felt better because we hadnt
All them millions we was going to makeshucks
We didnt neither one of us give a dern about them getting away from us
All we wanted was jest to get away from there and not get mixed up with no nigger problems any more
We eat supper and we set around a while and we went to bed purty middling early so as to get a good start in the morning
We got up early but early as it was the devil had been up earlier in that neighbourhood
About four oclock that morning a white woman about a half a mile from the village had been attacked by a nigger
They was doubt as to whether she would live but if she lived they wasnt no doubts she would always be more or less crazy
Fur besides everything else he had beat her insensible
And he had choked her nearly to death
The countryside was up with guns and pistols look ing fur that nigger
It wasnt no trouble guessing what would happen to him when they ketched him neither
And says Doctor Kirby when we hearn of it I hope to high heaven they DO catch him
They wasnt much doubt they would either
They was already beating up the woods and bushes and gangs was riding up and down the roads and every niggers house fur miles around was being searched and watched
We soon seen we would have trouble getting hosses and a rig in the village to take us to the railroad
Many of the hosses was being ridden in the manhunt
And most of the men who might have done the driving was busy at that too
The hotelkeeper himself had left his place standing wide open and went out
We didnt get any break fast neither
Danny says the doctor well just put enough money to pay the bill in an envelope on the register here and strike out on shanks ponies
Its only nine or ten miles to the railroadwell walk
But how about our stuff
I asts him
We had two big cases full of sample bottles of that dope besides our suit cases
Hang the dope
says the doctor I dont ever want to see it or hear of it again
Well leave it here
Put the things out of your suit case into mine and leave that here too
Sam can carry mine
I want to be on the move
So we left with Sam carrying the one suit case
It wasnt nine in the morning yet and we was starting out purty empty fur a long walk
Sam says the doctor as we was passing that there Big Bethel churchand it showed up there silent and shabby in the morning like a old coloured man that knows a heap moren hes going to tell Sam were you at the meeting here last night
Yass suh
I suppose it was a pretty tame affair after they found out their Elisha wasnt coming after all
Sam he walled his eyes and then he kind of chuckled
Well suh he says I spicions de mos on em don know dat YIT
The doctor asts him what he means
It seems the bishop must of done some thinking after we left him in the road or on his way back to that church
They had all begun to believe that there Elishyah was on the way to em and the bishops credit was more or less wrapped up with our being it
It was true he hadnt started that belief but it was believed and he didnt dare to stop it now
Fur if he stopped it they would all think he had fell down on his prophetics even although he hadnt prophesied jest exactly us
He was in a tight place that bishop but I bet you could always depend on him to get out of it with his flock
So what he told them niggers at the meeting last night was that he brung em a message from Elishyah Sam says the Elishyah that was to come
And the message was that the time was not ripe fur him to reveal himself as Elishyah unto the eyes of all men fur they had been too much sinfulness and wickedness and walking into the ways of evil right amongst that very congregation and disobedi ence of the bishop which was their guide
And he had sent em word Elishyah had that the bishop was his trusted servant and into the keeping of the bishop was give the power to deal with his people and prepare them fur the great day to come
And the bishop would give the word of his coming
He was a box that bishop was in spite of his crazy streaks and he had found a way to make himself stronger than ever with his bunch out of the very kind of thing that would have spoiled most peoples graft
They had had a big meeting till nearly morning and the power had hit em strong
Sam told us all about it
But the thing that seemed to interest the doctor and made him frown was the idea that all them niggers round about there still had the idea he was the feller that had been prophesied to come
All except Sam mebby
Sam had spells when he was real sensible and other spells when he was as bad as the believingest of them all
It was a fine day and really joyous to be awalking
It would of been a good deal joyouser if we had had some breakfast but we figgered we would stop somewheres at noon and lay in a good square country meal
That wasnt such a very thick settled country
But everybody seemed to know about the man hunt that was going on here there and everywhere
People would come down to the road side as we passed and gaze after us
Or mebby ast us if we knowed whether he had been ketched yet
Women and kids mostly or old men but now and then a younger man too
We noticed they wasnt no niggers to speak of that wasnt busiern all get out working at something or other that day
They is considerable woods in that country yet though lots has been cut off
But they was some times right long stretches where they would be woods on both sides of the road more or less thick with underbrush between the trees
We tramped along each busy thinking his own thoughts and having a purty good time jest doing that without there being no use of talking
I was thinking that I liked the doctor better fur turning his back on all this game jest when he might of made some sort of a deal with the bishop and really made some money out of it in the end
He never was so good a business man as he thought he was Doctor Kirby wasnt
He always could make himself think he was
But when it come right down to brass tacks he wasnt
You give him a scheme that would TALK well the kind of a josh talk he liked to get off fur his own enjoyment and he would take up with it every time instead of one that had more promise of money to it if it was worked harder
He was thinking of the TALK moren he was of the money mostly and he was always saying some thing about art fur arts sake which was plumb foolishness fur he never painted no pictures
Well he never got over being more or less of a puzzle to me
But fur some reason or other this morning he seemed to be in a better humour with himself after we had walked a while than I had seen him in fur a long time
We come to the top of one long hill which it had made us sweat to climb and without saying nothing to each other we both stopped and took off our hats and wiped our foreheads and drawed long breaths content to stand there fur jest a minute or two and look around us
The road run straight ahead and dipped down and then clumb up another hill about an eighth of a mile in front of us
It made a little valley
Jest about the middle between the two hills a crick meandered through the bottom land
Woods growed along the crick and along both sides of the road we was travelling
Right nigh the crick they was another road come out of the woods to the lefthand side and switched into the road we was travelling and used the same bridge to cross the crick by
They was three or four houses here and there with chimbleys built up on the outside of them and blue smoke coming out
We stood and looked at the sight before us and forgot all the troubles we had left behind fur a couple of minutesit all looked so peaceful and quiet and homeyfied and nice
Well says the doctor after we had stood there a piece I guess we better be moving on again Danny
But jest as Sam who was follering along behind with that suit case picks it up and puts it on his head agin they come a sound from away off in the distance somewheres that made him set it down quick
And we all stops in our tracks and looks at each other
It was the voice of a hound dognot so awful loud but clear and mellow and tuneful and carried to us on the wind
And then in a minute it come agin sharper and quicker
They yells like that when they have struck a scent
As we stood and looked at each other they come a crackle in the underbrush jest to the left of us
We turned our heads thataway jest as a nigger man give a leap to the top of a rail fence that separated the road from the woods
He was going so fast that instead of climbing that fence and bal ancing on the top and jumping off he jest simply seemed to hit the top rail and bounce on over like he had been throwed out of the heart of the woods and he fell sprawling over and over in the road right before our feet
He was onto his feet in a second and fur a minute he stood up straight and looked at usan ashes coloured nigger ragged and bleeding from the under brush redeyed and with slavers trickling from his red lips and sobbing and gasping and panting fur breath
Under his brown skin where his shirt was torn open acrost his chest you could see that niggers heart abeating
But as he looked at us they come a sudden change acrost his facehe must of seen the doctor before and with a sob he throwed himself on his knees in the road and clasped his hands and held em out toward Doctor Kirby
ELISHyah
ELISHyah
he sings out rocking of his body in a kind of tune reveal yosef reveal yosef an hep me NOW
Lawd Gawd ELISHyah beckon fo a CHAiot yo chaiot of FIAH
Lif me lif melif me away fum hyah in er chaiot o FIAH
The doctor he turned his head away and I knowed the thought working in him was the thought of that white woman that would always be an idiot for life if she lived
But his lips was dumb and his one hand stretched itself out toward that nigger in the road and made a wiping motion like he was trying fur to wipe the picture of him and the thought of him offn a slate forevermore
Jest then nearer and louder and sharper and with an eager sound like they knowed they almost had him now them hounds voices come ringing through the woods and with them come the mixed up shouts of men
RUN
yells Sam waving of that suit case round his head fur one nigger will always try to help another no matter what hes done
Run fo de branchgit yo foots in de worter an fling em off de scent
He bounded down the hill that redeyed nigger and left us standing there
But before he reached the crick the whole manhunt come busting through the woods the dogs astraining at their straps
The men was all on foot with guns and pistols in their hands
They seen the nigger and they all let out a yell and was after him
They ketched him at the crick and took him off along that road that turned off to the left
I hearn later he was a member of Bishop Warrens congregation so they hung him right in front of Big Bethel church
We stood there on top of the hill and saw the chase and capture
Doctor Kirbys face was sweating worse than when we first clumb the hill
He was thinking about that nigger that had pleaded with him
He was thinking also of the woman
He was glad it hadnt been up to him personal right then and there to butt in and stop a lynching
He was glad fur with them two pictures in front of him he didnt know what he would of done
Thank heaven
I hearn him say to himself
Thank heaven that it wasnt REALLY in my power to choose
CHAPTER XVIII Well we had pork and greens fur dinner that day with the best cornbread I ever eat anywheres and buttermilk and sweet potato pie
We got em at the house of a feller named WithersOld Daddy Withers
Which if they was ever a nicer old man than him or a nicer old woman than his wife I never run acrost em yet
They lived all alone them Witherses with only a couple of niggers to help them run their farm
After we eats our dinner and Sam gets hisn out to the kitchen we sets out in front of the house and gets to talking with them and gets real well acquainted
Which we soon found out the secret of old Daddy Witherss lifethat there innocentlooking old jigger was a poet
He was kind of proud of it and kind of shamed of it both to oncet
The way it come out was when the doctor says one of them quotations he is always getting off and the old man he looks pleased and says the rest of the piece it dropped out of straight through
Then they had a great time quoting it at each other them two and I seen the doctor is good to loaf around there the rest of the day like as not
Purty soon the old lady begins to get mighty proud looking over something or other and she leans over and whispers to the old man Shall I bring it out Lemuel
The old man he shakes his head no
But she slips into the house anyhow and fetches out a little book with a pale green cover to it and hands it to the doctor
Bless my soul says Doctor Kirby looking at the old man you dont mean to say you write verse yourself
The old man he gets red all over his face and up into the roots of his white hair and down into his white beard and makes believe he is a little mad at the old lady fur showing him off thataway
Mother he says yo shouldnt have done that
They had had a boy years before and he had died but he always called her mother the same as if the boy was living
He goes into the house and gets his pipe and brings it out and lights it acting like that book of poetry was a mighty small matter to him
But he looks at Doctor Kirby out of the corner of his eyes and cant keep from getting sort of eager and trembly with his pipe and I could see he was really anxious over what the doctor was thinking of them poems he wrote
The doctor reads some of em out loud
Well it was kind of homemade poetry Old Daddy Witherss was
It wasnt like no other poetry I ever struck
And I could tell the doctor was thinking the same about it
It sounded somehow like it hadnt been jointed together right
You would keep listening fur it to rhyme and get all worked up watching and waiting fur it to and make bets with yourself whether it would rhyme or it wouldnt
And then it ginerally wouldnt
I never hearn such poetry to get a persons expectances all worked up and then go back on em
But if you could of told what it was all about you wouldnt of minded that so much
Not that you can tell what most poetry is about but you dont care so long as it keeps hopping along lively
What you want in poetry to make her sound good according to my way of thinking is to make her jump lively and then stop with a bang on the rhymes
But Daddy Withers was so independentlike he would jest natcherally try to force two words to rhyme whether the Lord made em fur mates or notlike as if you would try to make a couple of kids kiss and make up by bumping their heads together
They jest simply wont do it
But Doctor Kirby he let on like he thought it was fine poetry and he read them pieces over and over agin out loud and the old man and the old woman was both mighty tickled with the way he done it
He wouldnt of had em know fur anything he didnt believe it was the finest poetry ever wrote Doctor Kirby wouldnt
They was four little books of it altogether
Slim books that looked as if they hadnt had enough to eat like a stray cat whose ribs is rubbing together
It had cost Daddy Withers five hundred dollars apiece to get em published
A feller in Boston charged him that much he said
It seems he would go along fur years raking and scraping of his money together so as to get enough ahead to get out another book
Each time he had his hopes the big news papers would mebby pay some attention to it and he would get recognized
But they never did said the old man kind of sad it always fell flat
Why FATHER
the old lady begins and finishes by running back into the house agin
She is out in a minute with a clipping from a newspaper and hands it over to Doctor Kirby as proud as a kid with coppertoed boots
The doctor reads it all the way through and then he hands it back without saying a word
The old lady goes away to fiddle around about the housework purty soon and the old man looks at the doctor and says Well you see dont you
Yes says the doctor very gentle
I wouldnt have HER know for the world says Daddy Withers
I know and YOU know that news paper piece is just simply poking fun at my poetry and making a fool of me the whole way through
As soon as I read it over careful I saw it wasnt really praise though there was a minute or two I thought my recognition had come
But SHE dont know it aint serious from start to finish
SHE was allmighty pleased when that piece come out in print
And I dont intend she ever shall know it aint real praise
His wife was so proud when that piece come out in that New York paper he said she cried over it
She said now she was glad they had been doing without things fur years and years so they could get them little books printed one after the other fur now fame was coming
But sometimes Daddy Withers says he suspicions she really knows he has been made a fool of and is pertending not to see it fur his sake the same as he is pertending fur HER sake
Well they was a mighty nice old couple and the doctor done a heap of pertending fur both their sakesthey wasnt nothing else to do
Howd you come to get started at it
he asts
Daddy Withers says he dont rightly know
Mebby he says it was living there all his life and watching things growingwatching the cotton grow and the corn and getting acquainted with birds and animals and trees and things
Helping of things to grow he says is a good way to under stand how God must feel about humans
For what you plant and help to grow he says you are sure to get to caring a heap about
You cant help it
And that is the reason he says God can be depended on to pull the human race through in the end even if appearances do look to be agin His doing it sometimes fur He started it to growing in the first place and thataway He got interested personal in it
And that is the main idea he says he has all the time been trying to get into that there poetry of hisn
But he reckons he aint got her in
Leastways he says no one has never seen her there but the doctor and the old lady and himself
Well for my part I never would of seen it there myself but when he said it out plain like that any one could of told what he meant
You hadnt orter lay things up agin folks if the folks cant help em
And I will say Daddy Withers was a fine old boy in spite of his poetry
Which it never really done any harm except being expensive to him and lots will drink that much up and never figger it an expense but one of the necessities of life
We went all over his place with him and we noticed around his house a lot of tin cans tacked up to posts and trees
They was fur the birds to drink out of and all the birds around there had found out about it and about Daddy Withers and wasnt scared of him at all
He could get acquainted with animals too so that after a long spell sometimes they would even let him handle them
But not if any one was around
They was a crow he had made a pet of used to hop around in front of him and try fur to talk to him
If he went to sleep in the front yard whilst he was reading that crow had a favour ite trick of stealing his spectacles offn his nose and flying up to the ridgepole of the house and cawing at him
Once he had been setting out a row of tomato plants very careful and he got to the end of the row and turned around and that there crow had been hopping along behind very sollum pulling up each plant as he set it out
It acted like it had done something mighty smart and knowed it that crow
So after that the old man named him Satan fur he said it was Satans trick to keep things from growing
They was some blue and white pigeons wasnt scared to come and set on his shoul ders but you could see the old man really liked that crow Satan bettern any of them
Well we hung around all afternoon listening to the old man talk and liking him better and better
First thing we knowed it was getting along toward supper time
And nothing would do but we must stay to supper too
We was pinted toward a place on the railroad called Smithtown but when we found we couldnt get a train from there till ten oclock that night anyhow and it was only three miles away we said wed stay
After supper we calculated wed better move
But the old man wouldnt hear of us walking that three miles
So about eight oclock he hitched up a mule to a onehoss wagon and we jogged along
They was a yaller moon sneaking up over the edge of the world when we started
It was so low down in the sky yet that it threw long shadders on the road and they was thick and black ones too
Because they was a lot of trees alongside the road and the road was narrow we went ahead mostly through the darkness with here and there patches of moonlight splashed onto the ground
Doctor Kirby and Old Man Withers was setting on the seat still gassing away about books and things and I was setting on the suit case in the wagon box right behind em
Sam he was sometimes in the back of the wagon
He had been moren half asleep all afternoon but now it was night he was waked up the way niggers and cats will do and every once in a while he would get out behind and cut a few capers in a moonlight patch jest fur the enjoyment of it and then run and ketch up with the wagon and crawl in agin fur it was going purty slow
The ground was sandy in spots and I guess we made a purty good load fur Beck the old mule
She stopped going up a little slope after we had went about a mile from the Witherses
Sam says hell get out and walk fur the wheels was in purty deep and it was hard going
Giddap Beck
says the old man
But Beck she wont
She dont stand like she is stuck neither but like she senses danger some wheres about
A hoss might go ahead into danger but a mule is more careful of itself and never goes butting in unless it feels sure they is a way out
Giddap says the old man agin
But jest then the shadders on both sides of the road comes to life
They wakes up and moves all about us
It was done so sudden and quiet it was half a minute before I seen it wasnt shadders but about thirty men had gathered all about us on every side
They had guns
Who are you
What dye want
asts the old man startled as three or four took care of the mules head very quick and quiet
Dont be skeered Daddy Withers says a drawly voice out of the dark we aint goin to hurt YOU
We got a little matter o business to tend to with them two fellers yo totin to town
CHAPTER XIX Thirtyi men with guns would be consider able of a proposition to buck against so we didnt try it
They took us out of the wagon and they pinted us down the road steering us fur a country schoolhouse which was I judged from their talk about a quarter of a mile away
They took us silent fur after we found they didnt answer no questions we quit asking any
We jest walked along and guessed what we was up against and why
Daddy Withers he trailed along behind
They had tried to send him along home but he wouldnt go
So they let him foller and paid no more heed to him
Sam he kept atalking and abegging and several men atelling of him to shut up
And him not adoing it
Till finally one feller says very disgustedlike Boys Im going to turn this nigger loose
Well want his evidence says another one
Evidence
says the first one
Whats the evidence of a scared nigger worth
I reckon that one this afternoon was consider able scared when he give us that evidence against himselfthat is if you call it evidence
A nigger can give evidence against a nigger and its all right says another voicewhich it come from a feller that had aholt of my wrist on the lefthand side of mebut these are white men we are going to try tonight
The case is too serious to take nigger evidence
Besides I reckon we got all the evidence any one could need
This nigger aint charged with any crime himself and my idea is that he aint to be allowed to figure one way or the other in this thing
So they turned Sam loose
I never seen nor hearn tell of Sam since then
They fired a couple of guns into the air as he started down the road jest fur fun and mebby he is running yet
The feller had been talking like he was a lawyer so I asts him what crime we was charged with
But he didnt answer me
And jest then we gets in sight of that schoolhouse
It set on top of a little hill partially in the moon light with a few sadlooking pine trees scattered around it and the fence in front broke down
Even after night you could see it was a shabby looking little place
Old Daddy Withers tied his mule to the broken down fence
Somebody busted the front door down
Somebody else lighted matches
The first thing I knowed we was all inside and four or five dirty little coal oil lamps with tin reflectors to em which I spose was used ordinary fur school exhibi tions was being lighted
We was waltzed up onto the teachers platform Doctor Kirby and me and set down in chairs there with two men to each of us and then a tall raw boned feller stalks up to the teachers desk and raps on it with the butt end of a pistol and says Gentlemen this meeting will come to order
Which they was orderly enough before that but they all took off their hats when he rapped like in a court room or a church and most of em set down
They set down in the school kids seats or on top of the desks and their legs stuck out into the aisles and they looked uncomfortable and awkward
But they looked earnest and they looked sollum too and they wasnt no joking nor skylarking going on nor no kind of rowdyness neither
These here men wasnt toughs by any manner of means but the most part of em respectable farmers
They had a look of meaning business
Gentlemen says the feller who had rapped who will you have for your chairman
I reckon youll do Will says another feller to the rawboned man which seemed to satisfy him
But he made em vote on it before he took office
Now then says Will the accused must have counsel
Will says another feller very hasty whats the use of all this fuss an feathers
You know as well as I do theres nothing legal about this
Its only necessary
For my part Buck Hightower says Will pounding on the desk you will please come to order
Which Buck done it
Now says the chairman turning toward Doctor Kirby who had been setting there looking thoughtful from one man to another like he was sizing each one up now I must explain to the chief defendant that we dont intend to lynch him
He stopped a second on that word LYNCH as if to let it soak in
The doctor he bowed toward him very cool and ceremonious and says mocking of him You reassure me MisterMisterWhat is your name
He said it in a way that would of made a saint mad
My name aint any difference says Will trying not to show he was nettled
You are quite right says the doctor looking Will up and down from head to foot very slow and insulting its of no consequence in the world
Will he flushed up but he makes himself steady and cool and he goes on with his little speech There is to be no lynching here tonight
There is to be a trial and if necessary an execution
Would it be asking too much says the doctor very polite if I were to inquire who is to be tried and before what court and upon what charge
There was a clearing of throats and a shuffling of feet fur a minute
One old deaf feller with a red nose who had his hand behind his ear and was leaning forward so as not to miss a breath of what any one said ast his neighbour in a loud whisper How
Then an undersized little feller who wasnt a farmer by his clothes got up and moved toward the platform
He had a bulgingout fore head and thin lips and a quick nervous way about him You are to be tried he says to the doctor speaking in a kind of shrill singsong that cut your nerves in that room full of bottledup excitement like a locust on a hot day
You are to be tried before this selfconstituted court of Caucasian citizens AngloSaxons sir every man of them whose for bears were at Runnymede
The charge against you is stirring up the negroes of this community to the point of revolt
You are accused sir of representing yourself to them as some kind of a Moses
You are arraigned here for endangering the peace of the county and the supremacy of the Caucasian race by inspiring in the negroes the hope of equality
Old Daddy Withers had been setting back by the door
I seen him get up and slip out
It didnt look to me to be any place fur a gentle old poet
While that little feller was making that charge you could feel the air getting tingly like it does before a rain storm
Some fellers started to clap their hands like at a political rally and to say Go it Billy
Thats right Harden
Which I found out later Billy Harden was in the state legislature and quite a speaker and knowed it
Will the chairman he pounded down the applause and then he says to the doctor pointing to Billy Harden No man shall say of us that we did not give you a fair trial and a square deal
Im goin to appoint this gentleman as your counsel and Im goin to give you a reasonable time to talk with him in pri vate and prepare your case
He is the ablest lawyer in southwest Georgia and the brightest son of Watson County
The doctor looks kind of lazy and Bill Harden and back agin at Will the chairman and smiles out of the corner of his mouth
Then he says sort of taking in the rest of the crowd with his remark like them two standing there pay ing each other compliments wasnt nothing but a joke I hope neither of you will take it too much to heart if Im not impressed by your sense of jus ticeor your friends ability
Then said Will I take it that you intend to act as your own counsel
You may take it says the doctor rousing of himself up you may take itfrom methat I refuse to recognize you and your crowd as a court of any kind that I know nothing of the silly accusa tions against me that I find no reason at all why I should take the trouble of making a defence before an armed mob that can only mean one of two things
One of two things
says Will
Yes says the doctor very quiet but raising his voice a little and looking him hard in the eyes
You and your gang can mean only one of two things
Either a bad joke or else And he stopped a second leaning forward in his chair with the look of half raising out of it so as to bring out the word very decided MURDER
The way he done it left that there word hanging in the room so you could almost see it and almost feel it there like it was a thing that had to be faced and looked at and took into account
They all felt it thataway too fur they wasnt a sound fur a minute
Then Will says We dont plan murder and youll find this aint a joke
And since you refuse to accept counsel Jest then Buck Hightower interrupts him by yell ing out I make a motion Billy Harden be prosecut ing attorney then
Lets hurry this thing along
And several started to applaud and call fur Billy Harden to prosecute
But Will he pounded down the applause agin and says I was about to suggest that Mr Harden might be prevailed upon to accept that task
Yes says the doctor very gentle and easy
Quite so
I fancied myself that Mr Harden came along with the idea of making a speech either for or against
And he grinned at Billy Harden in a way that seemed to make him wild though he tried not to show it
Somehow the doctor seemed to be all keyed up instead of scared like a feller thats had jest enough to drink to give him a fighting edge
Mr Chairman says Billy Harden flushing up and stuttering jest a little I bbeg leave to dddecline
What says the doctor sort of playing with Billy with his eyes and grin and turning like to let the whole crowd in on the joke DECLINE
The eminent gentleman declines
And he is going to sit down too with all that speech bottled up in him
O Demosthenes
he says you have lost your pebble in front of all Greece
Several grinned at Billy Harden as he set down and three or four laughed outright
I guess about half of them there knowed him fur a wind bag and some wasnt sorry to see him joshed
But I seen what the doctor was trying to do
He knowed he was in an awful tight place and he was feeling that crowds pulse so to speak
He had been talking to crowds fur twenty years and he knowed the kind of sudden turns they will take and how to take advantage of em
He was planning and figgering in his mind all the time jest what side to ketch em on and how to split up the one solid crowdmind into different minds
But the little bit of a laugh he turned against Billy Harden was only on the surface like a straw floating on a whirl pool
These men was here fur business
Buck Hightower jumps up and says Will Im getting tired of this court foolishness
The question is Does this man come into this county and do what he has done and get out again
We know all about him
He sneaked in here and gave out he was here to turn the niggers white that he was some kind of a newfangled Jesus sent especially to niggers which is blasphemy in itself and hes got em stirred up
Theyre boilin and festerin with notions of equality till were lucky if we dont have to lynch a dozen of em like they did in Atlanta last summer to get em back into their places again
Do we save ourselves more trouble by stringing him up as a warning to the negroes
Or do we invite trouble by turning him loose
Which
All it needs is a vote
And he set down agin
You could see he had made a hit with the boys
They was a kind of a growl rolled around the room
The feelings in that place was getting stronger and stronger
I was scared but trying not to show it
My fingers kept feeling around in my pocket fur something that wasnt there
But my brain couldnt remember what my fingers was feeling fur
Then it come on me sudden it was a buckeye I picked up in the woods in Indiany one day and I had lost it
I aint super stitious about buckeyes or horseshoes but remem bering I had lost it somehow made me feel worse
But Doctor Kirby had a good holt on himself his face was a bit reddern usual and his eyes was spark ling and he was both eager and watchful
When Buck Hightower sets down the chairman clears his throat like he is going to speak
But Just a moment says Doctor Kirby getting on his feet and taking a step toward the chairman
And the way he stopped and stood made everybody look at him
Then he went on Once more he says I call the attention of every man present to the fact that what the last speaker proposes is And then he let em have that word agin full in their faces to think about MURDER
Merely murder
He was bound they shouldnt get away from that word and what it stood fur
And every man there DID think too fur they was another little pause
And not one of em looked at another one fur a minute
Doctor Kirby leaned forward from the platform running his eyes over the crowd and jest natcherally shoved that word into the room so hard with his mind that every mind there had to take it in
But as he held em to it they come a bang from one of the windows
It broke the charm
Fur everybody jumped
I jumped myself
When the end of the world comes and the earth busts in the middle it wont sound no louder than that bang did
It was a wooden shutter
The wind was ris ing outside and it flew open and whacked agin the building
Then a big heavyset man that hadnt spoke before riz up from one of the hind seats like he had heard a dare to fight and walked slowly down toward the front
He had a red face which was considerable pockmarked and very deepset eyes and a deep voice
Since when he says taking up his stand a dozen feet or so in front of the doctor since when has any civilization refused to commit murder when murder was necessary for its protection
One of the top glasses of that window was out and with the shutter open they come a breeze through that fluttered some strips of dirtycoloured papers flyspecked and dusty and spiderwebbed that hung on strings acrost the room jest below the ceiling
I guess they had been left over from some Christmas doings
My friend said the pockmarked man to the doctorand the funny thing about it was he didnt talk unfriendly when he said itthe word you insist on is just a WORD like any other word
They was a spider rousted out of his web by that disturbance among the strings and papers
He started down from above on jest one string of web seemingly spinning part of it out of himself as he come the way they do
I couldnt keep my eyes offn him
Murder says the doctor is a thing
It is a WORD says the other man FOR a thing
For a thing which sometimes seems necessary
Lynching war execution murderthey are all words for different ways of wiping out human life
Killing sometimes seems wrong and sometimes right
But right or wrong and with one word or another tacked to it it is DONE when a community wants to get rid of something dangerous to it
That there spider was a squat uglylooking devil hunched up on his string amongst all his crooked legs
The wind would come in little puffs and swing him a little way toward the doctors head and then toward the pockmarked mans head back and forth and back and forth between them two as they spoke
It looked to me like he was listening to what they said and waiting fur something
Murder says the doctor is murderillegal killingand you cant make anything else out of it or talk anything else into it
It come to me all to oncet that that ugly spider was swinging back and forth like the pendulum on a clock and marking time
I wondered how much time they was left in the world
It would be none the less a murder said the pockmarked man if you were to be hanged after a trial in some county court
Society had been obliged to deny the privilege of committing murder to the individual and reserve it for the community
If our communal sense says you should die the thing is neither better nor worse than if a sheriff hanged you
I am not to be hanged by a sheriff says the doctor very cool and steady because I have com mitted no crime
I am not to be killed by you because you dare not in spite of all you say outrage the law to that extent
And they looked each other in the eyes so long and hard that every one else in the schoolhouse held their breath
DARE not
says the pockmarked man
And he reached forward slow and took that spider in his hand and crushed it there and wiped his hand along his pants leg
Dare not
YES BUT WE DARE
The only question for us men here is whether we dare to let you go free
Your defence of lynching says Doctor Kirby shows that you at least are a man who can think
Tell me what I am accused of
And then the trial begun in earnest
CHAPTER XX The doctor acted as his own lawyer and the pockmarked man whose name was Grimes as the lawyer agin us
You could see that crowd had made up its mind beforehand and was only giving us what they called a trial to satisfy their own conscience
But the fight was be twixt Grimes and Doctor Kirby the hull way through
One witness was a feller that had been in the hotel at Cottonville the night we struck that place
We had drunk some of his licker
This man admitted himself that he was here to turn the niggers white said the witness
Doctor Kirby had told em what kind of medicine he was selling
We both remembered it
We both had to admit it
The next witness was the feller that run the tavern at Bairdstown
He had with him fur proof a bottle of the stuff we had brought with us
He told how we had went away and left it there that very morning
Another witness told of seeing the doctor talking in the road to that there nigger bishop
Which any one could of seen it easy enough fur they wasnt nothing secret about it
We had met him by ac cident
But you could see it made agin us
Another witness says he lives not fur from that Big Bethel church
He says he has noticed the niggers was worked up about something fur several days
They are keeping the cause of it secret
He went over to Big Bethel church the night before he said and he listened outside one of the windows to find out what kind of doctrine that crazy bishop was preaching to them
They was all so worked up and the power was with em so strong and they was so excited they wouldnt of hearn an army march ing by
He had hearn the bishop deliver a message to his flock from the Messiah
He had seen him go wild afterward and preach an equality sermon
That was the lying message the old bishop had took to em and that Sam had told us about
But how was this feller to know it was a lie
He believed in it and he told it in a straightahead way that would make any one see he was telling the truth as he thought it to be
Then they was six other witnesses
All had been in the gang that lynched the nigger that day
That nigger had confessed his crime before he was lynched
He had told how the niggers had been expecting of a Messiah fur several days and how the doctor was him
He had died apreaching and aprophesying and thinking to the last minute maybe he was going to get took up in a chariot of fire
Things kept looking worse and worse fur us
They had the story as the niggers thought it to be
They thought the doctor had deliberately repre sented himself as such instead of which the doc tor had refused to be represented as that there Messiah
More than that he had never sold a bottle of that medicine
He had flung the idea of selling it way behind him jest as soon as he seen what the situation really was in the black coun ties
He had even despised himself fur going into it
But the looks of things was all the other way
Then the doctor give his own testimony
Gentlemen he says it is true that I came down here to try out that stuff in the bottle there and see if a market could be worked up for it
It is also true that after I came here and discovered what conditions were I decided not to sell the stuff
I didnt sell any
About this Messiah business I know very little more than you do
The situation was created and I blundered into it
I sent the negroes word that I was not the person they ex pected
The bishop lied to them
That is my whole story
But they didnt believe him
Fur it was jest what he would of said if he had been guilty as they thought him
And then Grimes gets up and says Gentlemen I demand for this prisoner the penalty of death
He has lent himself to a situation calculated to disturb in this county the peaceful domination of the black race by the white
He is a Northern man
But that is not against him
If this were a case where leniency were possi ble it should count for him as indicating an ig norance of the gravity of conditions which confront us here every day and all the time
If he were my own brother I would still demand his death
Lest he should think my attitude dictated by any lingering sectional prejudice I may tell him what you all knowyou people among whom I have lived for thirty yearsthat I am a Northern man myself
The negro who was lynched today might never have committed the crime he did had not the wild disturbing dream of equality been stirring in his brain
Every speech every look every action which encourages that idea is a crime
In this county where the blacks outnumber us we must either rule as masters or be submerged
This man is still believed by the negroes to possess some miraculous power
He is therefore doubly dangerous
As a sharp warning to them he must die
His death will do more toward ending the trouble he has prepared than the death of a dozen negroes
And as God is my witness I speak and act not through passion but from the dictates of conscience
He meant it Grimes did
And when he set down they was a hush
And then Will the chairman begun to call the roll
I never been much of a person to have bad dreams or nightmares or things like that
But ever since that night in that schoolhouse if I do have a night mare it takes the shape of that roll being called
Every word was like a spade grating and gritting in damp gravel when a grave is dug
It sounded so to me
Samuel Palmour how do you vote
that chair man would say
Samuel Palmour or whoever it was would hist himself to his feet and he would say something like this Death
He wouldnt say it joyous
He wouldnt say it mad
He would be pale when he said it mebby and mebby trembling
But he would say it like it was a duty he had to do that couldnt be got out of
That there trial had lasted so long they wasnt hot blood left in nobody jest thenonly cold blood and determination and duty and principle
Buck Hightower says the chairman how do you vote
Death says Buck death for the man
But say cant we jest LICK the kid and turn him loose
And so it went up one side the room and down the other
Grimes had showed em all their duty
Not but what they had intended to do it before Grimes spoke
But he had put it in such a way they seen it was something with even MORE principle to it than they had thought it was before
Billy Harden says the chairman how do you vote
Billy was the last of the bunch
And most had voted fur death
Billy he opened his mouth and he squared himself away to orate some
But jest as he done so the door opened and Old Daddy Withers stepped in
He had been gone so long I had plumb forgot him
Right behind him was a tall spare feller with black eyes and straight irongray hair
I vote says Billy Harden beginning of his speech I vote for death
The reason upon which I base But Doctor Kirby riz up and interrupted him
You are going to kill me he said
He was pale but he was quiet and he spoke as calm and steady as he ever done in his life
You are going to kill me like the crowd of sneaking cowards that you are
And you ARE such cowards that youve talked two hours about it instead of doing it
And Ill tell you why youve talked so much because no ONE of you alone would dare to do it and every man of you in the end wants to go away thinking that the other fellow had the biggest share in it
And no ONE of you will fire the gun or pull the ropeyoull do it ALL TOGETHER in a crowd because each one will want to tell himself he only touched the rope or that HIS GUN missed
I know you by God
he shouted flushing up into a passionand it brought blood into their faces tooI know you right down to your roots better than you know yourselves
He was losing hold of himself and roaring like a bull and flinging out taunts that made em squirm
If he wanted the thing over quick he was taking jest the way to warm em up to it
But I dont think he was figgering on anything then or had any plan up his sleeve
He had made up his mind he was going to die and he was so mad because he couldnt get in one good lick first that he was nigh crazy
I looked to see him lose all sense in a minute and rush amongst them guns and end it in a whirl
But jest as I figgered he was on his tiptoes fur that and was getting up my own sand he throwed a look my way
And something sobered him
He stood there digging his finger nails into the palms of his hands fur a minute to get himself back
And when he spoke he was sort of husky
That boy there he says
And then he stops and kind of chokes up
And in a minute he was begging fur me
He tells em I wasnt mixed up in nothing
He wouldnt of done it fur himself but he begged fur me
Nobody had paid much attention to me from the first except Buck High tower had put in a good word fur me
But some how the doctor had got the crowd listening to him agin and they all looked at me
It got next to me
I seen by the way they was looking and I felt it in the air that they was going to let me off
But Doctor Kirby he had always been my friend
It made me sore fur to see him thinking I wasnt with him
So I says You better can that line of talk
They dont get you without they get me too
You orter know I aint a quitter
You give me a pain
And the doctor and me stood and looked at each other fur a minute
He grinned at me and all of a sudden we was neither one of us much giving a whoop fur it had come to us both at oncet what awful good friends we was with each other
But jest then they come a slow easygoing sort of a voice from the back part of the room
That feller that had come in along with Old Daddy Withers come sauntering down the middle aisle fumbling in his coat pocket and speaking as he come
Ive been hearing a great deal of talk about killing people in the last few minutes he says
Everybody rubbered at him
CHAPTER XXI There was something sort of careless in his voice like he had jest dropped in to see a show and it had come to him sudden that he would enjoy himself fur a minute or two taking part in it
But he wasnt going to get TOO worked up about it either fur the show might end by mak ing him tired after all
As he come down the aisle fumbling in his coat he stopped and begun to slap all his pockets
Then his face cleared and he dived into a vest pocket
Everybody looked like they thought he was going to pull something important out of it
But he didnt
All he pulled out was jest one of these here little ordinary red books of cigarette papers
Then he dived fur some loose tobacco and begun to roll one
I noticed his fingers was long and white and slim and quick
But not excited fingers only the kind that seems to say as much as talking says
He licked his cigarette and then he sauntered ahead looking up
As he looked up the light fell full on his face fur the first time
He had high cheek bones and irongray hair which he wore rather long and very black eyes
As he lifted his head and looked close at Doctor Kirby a change went over both their faces
Doctor Kirbys mouth opened like he was going to speak
So did the other fellers
One side of his mouth twitched into something that was too surprised to be a grin and one of his black eyebrows lifted itself up at the same time
But neither him nor Doctor Kirby spoke
He stuck his cigarette into his mouth and turned sideways from Doctor Kirby like he hadnt noticed him perticler
And he turns to the chairman
Will he says
And everybody listens
You could see they all knowed him and that they all respected him too by the way they was waiting to hear what he would say to Will
But they was all impatient and eager too and they wouldnt wait very long although now they was hushing each other and leaning forward
Will he says very polite and quiet can I trouble you for a match
And everybody let go their breath
Some with a snort like they knowed they was being trifled with and it made em sore
His eyebrows goes up agin like it was awful impolite in folks to snort thata way and he is surprised to hear it
And Will he digs fur a match and finds her and passes her over
He lights his cigarette and he draws a good inhale and he blows the smoke out like it done him a heap of good
He sees something so interesting in that little cloud of smoke that everybody else looks at it too
Do I understand he says that some one is going to lynch some one or something of that sort
Thats about the size of it colonel says Will
Um
he says What for
Then everybody starts to talk all at once half of them jumping to their feet and making a perfect hullabaloo of explanations you couldnt get no sense out of
In the midst of which the colonel takes a chair and sets down and crosses one leg over the other swinging the loose foot and smiling very patient
Which Will remembers he is chairman of that meeting and pounds fur order
Thank you Will says the colonel like getting order was a personal favour to him
Then Billy Harden gets the floor and squares away fur a long winded speech telling why
But Buck Hightower jumps up impatient and says Weve been through all that Billy
That man there has been tried and found guilty colonel and theres only one thing to dostring him up
Buck I wouldnt says the colonel very mild
But that there man Grimes gets up very sober and steady and says Colonel you dont understand
And he tells him the hull thing as he believed it to bewhy they has voted the doctor must die the room warm ing up agin as he talks and the colonel listening very interested
But you could see by the looks of him that colonel wouldnt never be interested so much in anything but himself and his own way of doing things
In a way he was like a feller that enjoys having one part of himself stand aside and watch the playactor game another part of himself is acting out
Grimes he says when the pockmarked man finishes I wouldnt
I really wouldnt
Colonel says Grimes showing his knowledge that they are all standing solid behind him WE WILL
Ah says the colonel his eyebrows going up and his face lighting up like he is really beginning to enjoy himself and is glad he come indeed
Yes says Grimes WE WILL
But not says the colonel before we have talked the thing over a bit I hope
Theres been too much talk here now yells Buck Hightower talk talk till by God Im sick of it
Wheres that ROPE
But listen to himlisten to the colonel
some one else sings out
And then they was another hullabaloo some yelling no
And the colonel very patient rolls himself another smoke and lights it from the butt of the first one
But finally they quiets down enough so Will can put it to a vote
Which vote goes fur the colonel to speak
Boys he begins very quiet I wouldnt lynch this man
In the first place it will look bad in the newspapers and The newspapers be dd
says some one
And in the second place goes on the colonel it would be against the law and The law be dd
says Buck Hightower
Theres a higher law
says Grimes
Against the law says the colonel rising up and throwing away his cigarette and getting inter ested
I know how you feel about all this negro busi ness
And I feel the same way
We all know that we must be the negros masters
Grimes there found that out when he came South and the idea pleased him so he hasnt been able to talk about anything else since
Grimes has turned into what the Northern newspapers think a typical Southerner is
Boys this thing of lynching gets to be a habit
Theres been a negro lynched today
Hes the third in this county in five years
They all needed killing
If the thing stopped there I wouldnt care so much
But the habit of illegal killing grows when it gets started
Its grown on you
Youre fixing to lynch your first white man now
If you do youll lynch an other easier
Youll lynch one for murder and the next for stealing hogs and the next because hes unpopular and the next because he happens to dun you for a debt
And in five years life will be as cheap in Watson County as it is in a New York slum where they feed immigrants to the factories
Youll all be toting guns and grudges and trying to lynch each other
The place to stop the thing is where it starts
You cant have it both waysyouve got to stand pat on the law or else see the law spit on right and left in the end and NOBODY safe
Its either law or But says Grimes theres a higher law than that on the statute books
Theres Theres a lot of flubdub says the colonel about higher laws and unwritten laws
But weve got high enough law written if we live up to it
Theres Colonel Tom Buckner says Buck Hightower what kind of law was it when you shot Ed Howard fifteen years ago
What Youre out of order says the chairman Colonel Buckner has the floor
And Ill remind you Buck Hightower that on the occasion you drag in Colonel Buckner didnt do any talking about higher laws or unwritten laws
He sent word to the sheriff to come and get him if he dared
Boys says the colonel Im preaching you higher doctrine than Ive lived by and Ive made no claim to be better or more moral than any of you
Im not
Im in the same boat with all of you and I tell you its up to ALL of us to stop lynch ings in this countyto set our faces against it
I tell you Is that all youve got to say to us colonel
The question come out of a group that had drawed nearer together whilst the colonel was talking
They was tired of listening to talk and arguments and showed it
The colonel stopped speaking short when they flung that question at him
His face changed
He turned serious all over
And he let loose jest one word NO
Not very loud but with a ring in it that sounded like danger
And he got em waiting agin and hanging on his words
No
he repeats louder not all
I have this to say to you And he paused agin pointing one long white finger at the crowd IF YOU LYNCH THIS MAN YOU MUST KILL ME FIRST
I couldnt get away from thinking as he stood there making them take that in that they was some thing like a playactor about him
But he was in earnest and he would play it to the end fur he liked the feelings it made circulate through his frame
And they saw he was in earnest
Youll lynch him will you
he says a kind of passion getting into his voice fur the first time and his eyes glittering
You think you will
Well you WONT
You wont because I say NOT
Do you hear
I came here tonight to save him
You might string HIM up and not be called to account for it
But how about ME
He took a step forward and looking from face to face with a dare in his eyes he went on Is there a man among you fool enough to think you could kill Tom Buckner and not pay for it
He let em all think of that for jest another minute before he spoke agin
His face was as white as a piece of paper and his nostrils was working but everything else about him was quiet
He looked the master of them all as he stood there Colonel Tom Buckner didstraight and splendid and keen
And they felt the danger in him and they felt jest how fur he would go now he was started
You didnt want to listen to me a bit ago he said
Now you must
Listen and choose
You cant kill that man unless you kill me too
TRY IT IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
He reached over and took from the teachers desk the sheet of paper Will had used to check off the name of each man and how he voted
He held it up in front of him and every man looked at it
You know me he says
You know I do not break my word
And I promise you that unless you do kill me here tonightyes as God is my witness I THREATEN youI will spend every dollar I own and every atom of influence I possess to bring each one of you to justice for that mans murder
They knowed that crowd did that killing a man like Colonel Bucknera leader and a big man in that part of the statewas a different proposition from killing a stranger like Doctor Kirby
The sense of what it would mean to kill Colonel Buckner was sinking into em and showing on their faces
And no one could look at him standing there with his determination blazing out of him and not under stand that unless they did kill him as well as Doctor Kirby hed do jest what he said
I told you he said not raising his voice but dropping it and making it somehow come creeping nearer to every one by doing that I told you the first white man you lynched would lead to other lynchings
Let me show you what youre up against tonight
Kill the man and the boy here and you must kill me
Kill me and you must kill Old Man Withers too
Every one turned toward the door as he men tioned Old Man Withers
He had never been very far into the room
Oh hes gone said Colonel Tom as they turned toward the door and then looked at each other
Gone home
Gone home with the name of every man present
Dont you see youd have to kill Old Man Withers too if you killed me
And then HIS WIFE
And thenhow many more
Do you see it widenthat pool of blood
Do you see it spread and spread
He looked down at the floor like he really seen it there
He had em going now
They showed it
If you shed one drop he went on you must shed more
Cant you see itwidening and deep ening widening and deepening till youre wading knee deep in ittill it climbs to your waiststill it climbs to your throats and chokes you
It was a horrible idea the way he played that there pool of blood and he shuddered like he felt it climbing up himself
And they felt it
A few men cant kill a hull dern county and get away with it
The way he put it thats what they was up against
Now says Colonel Tom what man among you wants to start it
Nobody moved
He waited a minute
Still nobody moved
They all looked at him
It was awful plain jest where they would have to begin
It was awful plain jest what it would all end up in
And I guess when they looked at him standing there so fine and straight and splendid it jest seemed plumb unpossible to make a move
There was a spirit in him that couldnt be killed
Doctor Kirby said afterward that was what come of being real quality which was what Colonel Tom was it was that in him that licked em
It was the best part of their own selves and the best part of their own country speaking out of him to them that done it
Mebby so
Anyhow after a minute more of that strain a feller by the door picks up his gun out of the corner with a scrape and hists it to his shoulder and walks out
And then Colonel Tom says to Will with his eyebrow going up and that onesided grin coming onto his face agin Will perhaps a motion to adjourn would be in order
CHAPTER XXII So many different kinds of feeling had been chasing around inside of me that I had numb spots in my emotional ornaments and intellectual organs
The room cleared out of everybody but Doctor Kirby and Colonel Tom and me
But the sound of the crowd going into the road and their footsteps dying away and then after that their voices quitting all made but very little sense to me
I could scarcely realize that the dan ger was over
I hadnt been paying much attention to Doctor Kirby while the colonel was making that grand stand play of hisn and getting away with it
Doc tor Kirby was setting in his chair with his head sort of sunk on his chest
I guess he was having a hard time himself to realize that all the danger was past
But mebby it wasnt thathe looked like he might really of forgot where he was fur a minute and might be thinking of something that had happened a long time ago
The colonel was leaning up agin the teachers desk smoking and looking at Doctor Kirby
Doctor Kirby turns around toward the colonel
You have saved my life he says getting up out of his chair like he had a notion to step over and thank him fur it but was somehow not quite sure how that would be took
The colonel looks at him silent fur a second and then he says without smiling Do you flatter yourself it was because I think it worth anything
The doctor dont answer and then the colonel says Has it occurred to you that I may have saved it because I want it
WANT it
Do you know of any one who has a better right to TAKE it than I have
Perhaps I saved it because it BELONGS to medo you suppose I want any one else to kill what I have the best right to kill
Tom says Doctor Kirby really puzzled to judge from his actions I dont understand what makes you say you have the right to take my life
Dave where is my sister buried
asts Colonel Tom
Buried
says Doctor Kirby
My God Tom is she DEAD
I ask you says Colonel Tom
And I ask you says Doctor Kirby
And they looked at each other both wonderized and trying to understand
And it busted on me all at oncet who them two men really was
I orter knowed it sooner
When the colonel was first called Colonel Tom Buckner it struck me I knowed the name and knowed something about it
But things which was my own consarns was attract ing my attention so hard I couldnt remember what it was I orter know about that name
Then I seen him and Doctor Kirby knowed each other when they got that first square look
That orter of put me on the track that and a lot of other things that had happened before
But I didnt piece things together like I orter done
It wasnt until Colonel Tom Buckner called him Dave and ast him about his sister that I seen who Doctor Kirby must really be
HE WAS THAT THERE DAVID ARMSTRONG
And the brother of the girl he had run off with had jest saved his life
By the way he was talking he had saved it simply because he thought he had the first call on what to do with it
Where is she
asts Colonel Tom
I ask you says Doctor Kirbyor David Armstrongagin
Well I thinks to myself here is where Daniel puts one acrost the plate
And I breaks in You both got another guess coming I says
She aint buried anywheres
She aint even dead
Shes living in a little town in Indiany called Athens or she was about eighteen months ago
They both looks at me like they thinks I am crazy
What do you know about it
says Doctor Kirby
Are you David Armstrong
says I
Yes says he
Well I says you spent four or five days within a stones throw of her a year ago last summer and she knowed it was you and hid herself away from you
Then I tells them about how I first happened to hear of David Armstrong and all I had hearn from Martha
And how I had stayed at the Davises in Tennessee and got some more of the same story from George the old nigger there
But Danny says the doctor why didnt you tell me all this
I was jest going to say that not knowing he was that there David Armstrong I didnt think it any of his business when Colonel Tom he says to Doctor KirbyI mean to David Armstrong Why should you be concerned as to her where abouts
You ruined her life and then deserted her
Doctor KirbyI mean David Armstrong stands there with the blood going up his face into his forehead slow and red
Tom he says you and I seem to be working at cross purposes
Maybe it would help some if you would tell me just how badly you think I treated Lucy
You ruined her life and then deserted her says Colonel Tom agin looking at him hard
I DIDNT desert her said Doctor Kirby
She got disgusted and left ME
Left me without a chance to explain myself
As far as ruining her life is concerned I suppose that when I married her Married her
cries out the colonel
And David Armstrong stares at him with his mouth open
My God
Tom he says did you think 
And they both come to another standstill
And then they talked some more and only got more mixed up than ever
Fur the doctor thinks she has left him and Colonel Tom thinks he has left her
Tom says the doctor suppose you let me tell my story and youll see why Lucy left me
Him and Colonel Tom had been chums together when they went through Princeton it seemsI picked that up from the talk and some of his story I learned afterward
He had come from Ohio in the beginning and his dad had had considerable money
Which he had enjoyed spending of it and when he was a young feller never liked to work at nothing else
It suited him
Colonel Tom he was considerable like him in that way
So they was good pals when they was to that school together
They both quit about the same time
A couple of years after that when they was both about twentyfive or six years old they run acrost each other accidental in New York one autumn
The doctor he was there figgering on going to work at something or other but they was so many things to do he was finding it hard to make a choice
His father was dead by that time and looking fur a job in New York the way he had been doing it was awful expensive and he was running short of money
His father had let him spend so much whilst he was alive he was very disappointed to find out he couldnt keep on forever looking fur work thataway
So Colonel Tom says why not come down home into Tennessee with him fur a while and they will both try and figger out what he orter go to work at
It was the fall of the year and they was purty good hunting around there where Colonel Tom lived and Dave hadnt never been South any and so he goes
He figgers he better take a good long vaca tion anyhow
Fur if he goes to work that winter or the next spring and ties up with some job that keeps him in an office there may be months and months pass by before he has another chance at a vacation
That is the worst part of a jobI found that out myselfyou never can tell when you are going to get shut of it once you are fool enough to start in
In Tennessee he had met Miss Lucy
Which her wedding to Prent McMakin was billed fur to come off about the first of November jest a month away
I dont know whether I ever told you or not says the doctor but I was engaged to be married myself Tom when I went down to your place
That was what started all the trouble
You know engagements are like vaccina tionsometimes they take and sometimes they dont
Of course I had thought at one time I was in love with this girl I was engaged to
When I found out I wasnt I should have told her so right away
But I didnt
I thought that she would get tired of me after a while and turn me loose
I gave her plenty of chances to turn me loose
I wanted her to break the engagement instead of me
But she wouldnt take the hints
She hung on like an Ohio Grand Army veteran to a country postoffice
About half the time I didnt read her letters and about nineteen twentieths of the time I didnt answer them
They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
But it isnt soit makes them all the fonder of you
I got into the habit of think ing that while Emma might be engaged to me I wasnt engaged to Emma
Not but what Emma was a nice girl you know but Well I met Lucy
We fell in love with each other
It just happened
I kept intending to write to the other girl and tell her plainly that everything was off
But I kept postponing it
It seemed like a deuce of a hard job to tackle
But finally I did write her
That was the very day Lucy promised to throw Prent McMakin over and marry me
You know how determined all your people were that Lucy should marry McMakin Tom
They had brought her up with the idea that she was going to and of course she was bored with him for that reason
We decided the best plan would be to slip away quietly and get married
We knew it would raise a row
But there was bound to be a row anyhow when they found she intended to marry me instead of McMakin
So we figured we might just as well be away from there
We left your place early on the morning of October 31 1888do you remember the date Tom
We took the train for Clarksville Tennessee and got there about two oclock that afternoon
I suppose you have been in that interesting centre of the tobacco industry
If you have you may remember that the courthouse of Montgomery County is right across the street from the best hotel
I got a license and a preacher without any trouble and we were married in the hotel parlour that afternoon
One of the hotel clerks and the county clerk himself were the witnesses
We went to Cincinnati and from there to Chicago
There we got rooms out on the South SideHyde Park they called it
And I got me a job
I had some money left but not enough to buy kohinoors and racehorses with
Beside I really wanted to get to workwanted it for the first time in my life
You remember young Clayton in our class
He and some other enterprising citizens had a building and loan association
Such things are no doubt immoral but I went to work for him
We had been in Chicago a week when Lucy wrote home what she had done and begged for giveness for being so abrupt about it
At least I suppose that is what she wrote
It was I remember exactly what she wrote says Colonel Tom
I never knew exactly says the doctor
The same mail that brought word from you that your grandfather had had some sort of a stroke as a consequence of our elopement brought also two letters from Emma
They had been forwarded from New York to Tennessee and you had for warded them to Chicago
Those letters began the trouble
You see I hadnt told Emma when I wrote breaking off the engagement that I was going to get married the next day
And Emma hadnt received my letter or else had made up her mind to ignore it
Anyhow those letters were regular loveletters
I hadnt really read one of Emmas letters for months
But somehow I couldnt help reading these
I had forgotten what a gift for the expres sion of sentiment Emma had
She fairly revelled in it Tom
Those letters were simply writhing with clinging female adjectives
They SQUIRMED with affection
You may remember that Lucy was a rather jealous sort of a person
Right in the midst of her alarm and grief and selfreproach over her grand father and in the midst of my efforts to comfort her she spied the feminine handwriting on those two letters
I had glanced through them hurriedly and laid them on the table
Tom I was in bad
The dates on them you know were so RECENT
I didnt want Lucy to read them
But I didnt dare to ACT as if I didnt want her to
So I handed them over
I supposeto a bride who had only been married a little more than a weekand who had hurt her grandfather nearly to death in the marry ing those letters must have sounded rather odd
I tried to explain
But all my explanations only seemed to make the case worse for me
Lucy was furiously jealous
We really had a devil of a row before we were through with it
I tried to tell her that I loved no one but her
She pointed out that I must have said much the same sort of thing to Emma
She said she was almost as sorry for Emma as she was for herself
When Lucy got through with me Tom I looked like thirty cents and felt like twentyfive of that was plugged
I didnt have sense enough to know that it was most of it grief over her grandfather and nerves and hysteria and the fact that she was only eighteen years old and lonely and that being a bride had a certain amount to do with it
She had told me that I was a beast and made me feel like one and I took the whole thing hard and believed her
I made a fine fiveact tragedy out of a jealous fit I might have softened into comedy if I had had the wit
I wasnt so very old myself and I hadnt ever been married before
I should have kept my mouth shut until it was all over and then when she began to cry I should have coaxed her up and made her feel like I was the only solid thing to hang on to in the whole world
But the bottom had dropped out of the uni verse for me
She had said she hated me
I was fool enough to believe her
I went downtown and began to drink
I come home late that night
The poor girl had been waiting up for mewaiting for hours and becoming more and more frightened when I didnt show up
She was over her jealous fit I suppose
If I had come home in good shape or in anything like it we would have made up then and there
But my condition stopped all that
I wasnt so drunk but that I saw her face change when she let me in
She was disgusted
In the morning I was sick and feverish
I was more than disgusted with myself
I was in despair
If she had hated me beforeand she had said she didwhat must she do now
It seemed to me that I had sunk so far beneath her that it would take years to get back
It didnt seem worth while making any plea for myself
You see I was young and had serious streaks all through me
So when she told me that she had written home again and was going backwas going to leave me I didnt see that it was only a bluff
I didnt see that she was really only waiting to forgive me if I gave her a chance
I started downtown to the building and loan office wondering when she would leave and if there was anything I could do to make her change her mind
I must repeat again that I was a foolthat I needed only to speak one word had I but known it
If I had gone straight to work everything might have come around all right even then
But I didnt
I had that whatstheuse feeling
And I stopped in at the Palmer House bar to get some thing to sort of pull me together
While I was there who should come up to the bar and order a drink but Prent McMakin
Yes
says Colonel Tom as near excited as he ever got
Yes says Armstrong nobody else
We saw each other in the mirror behind the bar
I dont know whether you ever noticed it or not Tom but McMakins eyes had a way of looking almost like crosseyes when he was startled or excited
They were a good deal too near together at any time
He gave me such a look when our eyes met in the mirror that for an instant I thought that he in tended to do me some mischiefshoot me you know for taking his bridetobe away from him or some fool thing like that
But as we turned toward each other I saw he had no intention of that sort
Hadnt he
says Colonel Tom mighty in terested
No says the doctor looking at Colonel Tom very puzzled did you think he had
Yes I did says the colonel right thoughtful
On the contrary says Armstrong we had a drink together
And he congratulated me
Made me quite a little speech in fact one of the flowery kind you know Tom and said that he bore me no rancour and all that
The deuce he did
says Colonel Tom very low like he was talking to himself
And then what
Then says the doctor thenlet me see its all a long time ago you know and McMakins part in the whole thing isnt really important
Im not so sure it isnt important says the colonel but go on
Then says Armstrong we had another drink together
In fact a lot of them
We got awfully friendly
And like a fool I told him of my quarrel with Lucy
LIKE a fool says Colonel Tom nodding his head
Go on
There isnt much more to tell says the doctor except that I made a worse idiot of myself yet and left McMakin about two oclock in the after noon as near as I can recollect
Somewhere about ten oclock that night I went home
Lucy was gone
I havent seen her since
Dave says Colonel Tom did McMakin happen to mention to you that day just why he was in Chicago
I suppose so says the doctor
I dont know
Maybe not
That was twenty years ago
Why
Because says Colonel Tom very grim and quiet because your first thought as to his intention when he met you in the bar was MY idea also
I thought he went to Chicago to settle with you
You see I got to Chicago that same afternoon
The same day
Yes
We were to have come together
But I missed the train and he got there a day ahead of me
He was waiting at the hotel for me to join him and then we were going to look you up together
He found you first and I never did find you
But I dont exactly understand says the doctor
You say he had the idea of shooting me
I dont understand everything myself says Colonel Tom
But I do understand that Prent McMakin must have played some sort of a two faced game
He never said a word to me about having seen you
Listen he goes on
When you and Lucy ran away it nearly killed our grandfather
In fact it finally did kill him
When we got Lucys letter that told you were in Chicago I went up to bring her back home
We didnt know what we were going to do McMakin and I but we were both agreed that you needed killing
And he swore that he would marry Lucy anyhow even MARRY HER
sings out the doctor but we WERE married
Dave Colonel Tom says very slow and steady you keep SAYING you were married
But its strangeits right STRANGE about that marriage
And he looked at the doctor hard and close like he would drag the truth out of him and the doctor met his look free and open
You would of thought Colonel Tom was saying with his look You MUST tell me the truth
And the doctor with his was answering I HAVE told you the truth
But Tom says the doctor that letter she wrote you from Chicago must Do you know what Lucy wrote
interrupts Colonel Tom
I remember exactly
It was sim ply FORGIVE ME
I LOVED HIM SO
I AM HAPPY
I KNOW IT IS WRONG BUT I LOVE HIM SO YOU MUST FORGIVE ME
But couldnt you tell from THAT we were married
cries out the doctor
She didnt mention it says Colonel Tom
She supposed that her own family had enough faith in her to take it for granted says the doctor very scornful his face getting red
But wait Dave says Colonel Tom quiet and cool
Dont bluster with me
There are still a lot of things to be explained
And that marriage is one of them
To go back a bit
You say you got to the house somewhere around ten oclock that evening and found Lucy gone
Do you remember the day of the month
It was November 14 1888
Exactly says Colonel Tom
I got to Chicago at six oclock of that very day
And I went at once to the address in Lucys letter
I got there between seven and eight oclock
She was gone
My thought was that you must have got wind of my coming and persuaded her to leave with you in order to avoid mealthough I didnt see how you could know when I would get there either when I thought it over
And you have never seen her since says Arm strong pondering
I HAVE seen her since says Colonel Tom and that is one thing that makes me say your story needs further explanation
But wherewhendid you see her
asts the doctor mighty excited
I am coming to that
I went back home again
And in July of the next year I heard from her
Heard from her
By letter
She was in Galesburg Illinois if you know where that is
She was living there alone
And she was almost destitute
I wrote her to come home
She would not
But she had to live
I got rid of some of our property in Ten nessee and took enough cash up there with me to fix her in a decent sort of way for the rest of her life and put it in the bank
I was with her there for ten days then I went back home to get Aunt Lucy Davis to help me in another effort to persuade her to return
But when I got back North with Aunt Lucy she had gone
Gone
Yes and when we returned without her to Tennessee there was a letter telling us not to try to find her
We thoughtI thoughtthat she might have taken up with you once again
But my God
Tom the doctor busts out you were with her ten days there in Galesburg
Didnt she tell you thencouldnt you tell from the way she actedthat she had married me
Thats the odd thing Dave says the colonel very slow and thoughtful
Thats what is so very strange about it all
I merely assumed by my atti tude that you were not married and she let me assume it without a protest
But did you ask her
Ask her
No
Cant you see that there was no reason why I should ask her
I was sure
And being sure of it naturally I didnt talk about it to her
You can understand that I wouldnt cant you
In fact I never mentioned you to her
She never mentioned you to me
You must have mistaken her Tom
I dont think its possible Dave said the colonel
You can mistake words and explanations a good deal easier than you can mistake an atmos phere
No Dave I tell you that theres something odd about itmarried or not Lucy didnt BELIEVE herself married the last time I saw her
But she MUST have known says the doctor as much to himself as to the colonel
She MUST have known
Any one could of told by the way he said it that he wasnt lying
I could see that Colonel Tom believed in him too
They was both sicking their intellects onto the job of figgering out how it was Lucy didnt know
Finally the doctor says very thoughtful Whatever became of Prentiss McMakin Tom
Dead says Colonel Tom quite a while ago
Hm says the doctor still thinking hard
And then looks at Colonel Tom like they was an idea in his head
Which he dont speak her out
But Colonel Tom seems to understand
Yes he says nodding his head
I think you are on the right track now
YesI shouldnt wonder
Well they puts this and that together and they agrees that whatever happened to make things hard to explain must of happened on that day that Prentiss McMakin met the doctor in the barroom and didnt shoot him as he had made his brags he would
Must of happened between the time that afternoon when Prentiss McMakin left the doctor and the time Colonel Tom went out to see his sister and found she had went
Must of happened some how through Prent McMakin
We goes home with Colonel Tom that night
And the next day all three of us is on our way to Athens Indiany where I had seen Miss Lucy at
CHAPTER XXIII Fur my part as the train kept getting further and further north my feelings kept getting more and more mixed
It come to me that I might be steering straight fur a bunch of trouble
The feeling that sadness and melancholy and seriousness was laying ahead of me kept me from really enjoying them dollarapiece meals on the train
It was Martha that done it
All this past and gone love story I had been hearing about reminded me of Martha
And I was steering straight toward her and no way out of it
How did I know but what that there girl might be expect ing fur to marry me or something like that
Not but what I was awful in love with her whilst we was together
But it hadnt really set in on me very deep
I hadnt forgot about her right away
But purty soon I had got to forgetting her oftener than I remembered her
And now it wasnt no use talk ingI jest wasnt in love with Martha no more and didnt have no ambition to be
I had went around the country a good bit and got intrusted in other things and saw several other girls I liked purty well
Keeping steady in love with jest one girl is mighty hard if you are moving around a good bit
But I was considerable worried about Martha
She was an awful romanceful kind of girl
And even the most sensible kind is said to be fools about getting their hearts broke and pining away and dying over a feller
I would hate to think Martha had pined herself sick
I couldnt shut my eyes to the fact we was en gaged to each other legal all right
And if she wanted to act mean about it and take it to a court it would likely be binding on me
Then I says to myself is she is mean enough to do that Ill be derned if I dont go to jail before I marry her and stay there
And then my conscience got to working inside of me agin
And a picture of her getting thin and not eating her vittles regular and waiting and waiting fur me to show up and me never doing it come to me
And I felt sorry fur poor Martha and thought mebby I would marry her jest to keep her from dying
Fur you would feel purty tough if a girl was to get so stuck on you it killed her
Not that I ever seen that really happen either but first and last there has been considerable talk about it
It wasnt but what I liked Martha well enough
It was the idea of getting married and staying married made me feel so anxious
Being married may work out all right fur some folks
But I knowed it never would work any with me
Or not fur long
Because why should I want to be tied down to one place or have a steady job
That would be a mean way to live
Of course with a person that was the doctors age it would be different
He had done his running around and would be willing to settle down now I guessed
That is if he could get his differences with this here Buckner family patched up satisfactory
I wondered whether he would be able to or not
Him and Colonel Tom were talking constant on the train all the way up
From the little stretches of their talk I couldnt help hearing I guessed each one was telling the other all that had happened to him in the time that had passed by
Colonel Tom what kind of a life he had lived and how he had married and his wife had died and left him a wid ower without any kids
And the doctorit was always hard fur me to get to calling him anything but Doctor Kirbyhow he had happened to start out with a good chancet in life and turn into jest a travelling fakir
Well I thinks to myself now that he has got to be that mebby her and him wont suit so well now even if they does get their differences patched up
Fur all the forgiving in the world aint going to change things or make them no different
But so long as the doctor appeared to want to find her so derned bad I was awful glad I had been the means of getting him and Miss Lucy together
He had done a lot fur me first and last the doctor had and I felt like it helped pay him a little
Though if they was to settle down like married folks I would feel like a good old sport was spoiled in the doctor too
We had to change cars at Indianapolis to get to that there little town
We was due to reach it about two oclock in the afternoon
And the nearer we got to the place the nervouser and nervouser all three of us become
And not owning we was
The last hour before we hit the place I took a drink of water every three minutes I was so nervous
And when we come into the town I was already standing out onto the platform
I wouldnt of been sur prised to find Martha and Miss Lucy down there to the station
But of course they wasnt
Fur some reason I felt glad they wasnt
Now I says to them two as we got off the train foller me and I will show you the house
Everybody rubbers at strangers in a country town and wonders why they have come and what they is selling and if they are mebby going to start a new grain elevator or buy land or what
The usual ones around the depot rubbered at us and I hearn one geezer say to another See that big feller there
He was through here a year or two ago selling patent medicine
You dont say so
says the other one like it was something important like a president or a circus had come and his eyes abugging out
And the doctor hearn them too
Fur some reason or other he flushed up and cut a look out of the corner of his eye at Colonel Tom
We went right through the main street and out toward the edge of town by the crick where Miss Lucys house was
And if anything all of us feel ing nervouser yet
And saying nothing and not looking at each other
And Colonel Tom rolling cigarettes and fumbling fur matches and lighting them and slinging them away
Fur how does any body know how women is going to take even the most ordinary little things
I knowed the way well enough and where the house was but as we went around the turn in the road I run acrost a surprised feeling
I come onto the place where our campfire had been them nights we was there
Looey had drug an old fence post onto the fire one night and the post had only burned half up
The butt end of it all charred and flaked was still laying in the grass and weeds there
It hit me with a queer feelinglike it was only yester day that fire had been lit there
And yet I knowed it had been a year and a half ago
Well it has always been my luck to run into things without the right kind of a lie fixed up ahead of time
They was three or four purty good stories I had been trying over in my head to tell Martha when I seen her
Any one of them stories might of done all right but I hadnt decided WHICH one to use
And of course I run plumb into Martha
She was standing by the gate which was about twenty yards from the veranda
And all four lies popped into my head at oncet and got so mixed up with one another there I seen right off it was useless to try to tell anything that sounded straight
Be sides when you are in the fix I was in what can you tell a girl anyhow
So I jest says to her Hullo
Martha she had been fussing around some flower bushes with a pair of shears and gloves on
She looks up when I says that and she sizes us all up standing by the gate and her eyes pops open and so does her mouth and she is so surprised to see me she drops her shears
And she looks scared too
Is Miss Buckner at home
asts Colonel Tom lifting his hat very polite
Miss BBBuckner
Martha stutters very scaredlike and not taking her eyes off of me to answer him
Miss Hampton Martha I says
Yyyes sshshe is says Martha
I wondered what was the matter with her
It is always my luck to get left all alone with my troubles
The doctor and the colonel they walked right past us when she said yes and up toward the house and left her and me standing there
I could of went along and butted in mebby
But I says to myself I will have the derned thing out here and now and know the worst
And I was so interested in my trouble and Martha that I didnt even notice if Miss Lucy met em at the door and if so how she acted
When I next looked up they was all in the house
Martha I begins
But she breaks in
Danny she says looking like she is going to cry dont lllook at me lllike that
If you knew ALL you wouldnt blame me
You Wouldnt blame you fur what
I asts her
I know its wrong of me she says begginglike
Mebby it is and mebby it aint I says
But what is it
But you never wrote to me she says
You never wrote to me I says not wanting her to get the best of me whatever it was she might be talking about
And then HE came to town Who
I asts her
Dont you know
she says
The man I am going to marry
When she said that I felt all of a sudden like when you are broke and hungry and run acrost a half dollar you had forgot about in your other pants
I was so glad I jumped
Great guns
I says
I had never really knowed what being glad was before
Oh Danny Danny she says putting her hands in front of her face and here you have come to claim me for your bride
Which showed me why she had looked so scared
That there girl had went and got engaged to another feller
And had been laying awake nights suffering fur fear I would turn up agin
And now I had
Looey he always said never to trust a woman
Martha I says you aint acted right with me
Oh Danny Danny she says I know it
I know it
Some fellers in my place I says would raise a dickens of a row
I DID love you once she says looking at me from between her fingers
Yes says I acting real melancholy you did
And now youve quit it they dont seem to me to be nothing left to live fur
Martha she was an awful romanceful girl
I got the notion that mebby she was enjoying her own remorsefulness a little bit
I fetched a deep sigh and I says Some fellers would kill theirselves on the spot
OhOhOh says Martha
But Martha says I I aint that mean
I aint going to do that
That dern girl ackshellay give me a disappointed look
If anything she was jest a bit TOO romanceful Martha was
No says I cheering up a little I am going to do something they aint many fellers would do Martha
Im going to forgive you
Free and fair and open
And give you back my half of that ring and Dern it
I had forgot I had lost that half of that there ring
I remembered so quick it stopped me
You always kept it Danny
she asts me very softspoken so as not to give pain to one so faithful and so noble as what I was
Let me see it Danny
I made like I was feeling through all my pockets fur it
But that couldnt last forever
I run out of pockets purty soon
And her face begun to show she was smelling a rat
Finally I says These aint my other clothesit must be in them
Danny she says I believe you LOST it
Martha I says taking a chancet you know you lost YOUR half
She owns up she has lost it a long while ago
And when she lost it she says she knowed that was fate and that our love was omened in under an evil star
And who was she she says to struggle agin fate
Martha I says Ill be honest with you
Fate got away with my half too one day when I didnt know they was crooks like her sticking around
Well I seen that girl seen through me then
Martha was awful smart sometimes
And each one was so derned tickled the other one wasnt go ing to do any pining away we like to of fell into love all over agin
But not quite
Fur neither one would ever trust the other one agin
So we felt more comfortable with each other
You aint never comfortable with a person you know is more honest than you be
But says Martha after a minute if you didnt come back to make me marry you what does Doctor Kirby want to see Miss Hampton about
And who was that with him
I had been nigh to forgetting the main thing we had all come here fur in my gladness at getting rid of any danger of marrying Martha
But it come to me all to oncet I had been missing a lot that must be taking place inside that house
I had even missed the way they first looked when she met em at the door and I wouldnt of missed that fur a lot
And I seen all to oncet what a big piece of news it will be to Martha
Martha I says they aint no Dr Hartley L Kirby
The man known as such is David Arm strong
I never seen any one so peetrified as Martha was fur a minute
Yes says I and the other one is Miss Lucys brother
And they are all three in there straighten ing themselves out and finding where everybody gets off at and why
One of these here serious times you read about
And you and me are missing it all like a couple of gumps
How can we hear
Martha says she dont know
You THINK I told her
Weve wasted five good minutes already
Ive GOT to hear the rest of it
Where would they be
Martha guesses they will all be in the sitting room which has got the best chairs in it
What is next to it
A back parlour or a bed room or what
I was thinking of how I happened to overhear Perfessor Booth and his fambly thataway
Martha says they is nothing like that to be tried
Martha I says this is serious
This here story they are thrashing out in there is the only derned sureenough romanceful story either you or me is ever lible to run up against personal in all our lives
It would of been a good deal nicer if they had ast us in to see the windup of it
Fur if it hadnt of been fur me they never would of been reunited and rejuvenated the way they be
But some people get stingy streaks with their concerns
You think
Martha she says Danny it wouldnt be honourable to listen
Martha I tells her after the way you and me went and jilted each other what kind of senses of honour have WE got to brag about
She remembers that the spare bedroom is right over the sitting room
The house is heated with stoves in the winter time
There is a register right through the floor of the spare bedroom and the ceiling of the sitting room
Not the kind of a register that comes from a twistedaround shaft in a house that uses furnace heat
But jest really a hole in the floor with a castiron grating to let the heat from the room below into the one above
She says she guesses two people that wasnt so very honourable might sneak into the house the back way and up the back stairs and into the spare bedroom and lay down on their stummicks on the floor being careful to make no noise and both see and hear through that register
Which we done it
CHAPTER XXIV I could hear well enough but at first I couldnt see any of them
But I gathered that Miss Lucy was standing up whilst she was talking and moving around a bit now and then
I seen one of her sleeves and then a wisp of her hair
Which was aggervating fur I wanted to know what she was like
But her voice was so soft and quiet that you kind of knowed before you seen her how she orter look
Prentiss McMakin came to me that day she was saying with an appealI hardly know how to tell you
She broke off
Go ahead Lucy says Colonel Toms voice
He was insulting she said
He had been drink ing
He wanted me totohe appealed to me to run off with him
I was furiousNATURALLY
Her voice changed as she said it enough so you could feel how furious Miss Lucy could get
She was like her brother Tom in some ways
I ordered him out of the house
His answer to that was an offer to marry me
You can imagine that I was surprised as well as angryI was perplexed
But I AM married
I cried
The idea that any of my own people or any one whom I had known at home would think I wasnt married was too much for me to take in all at once
You THINK you are said Prentiss McMakin with a smile
In spite of myself my breath stopped
It was as if a chilly hand had taken hold of my heart
I mean physically I felt like that
I AM married I repeated simply
I suppose that McMakin had got the story of our wedding from YOU
She stopped a minute
The doctors voice answered I suppose so like he was a very tired man
Anyhow she went on he knew that we went first to Clarksville
He said You think you are married Lucy but you are not
I wish you to understand that Prentiss McMakin did it all very very well
That is my excuse
He acted well
There was something about himI scarcely know how to put it
It sounds odd but the truth is that Prentiss McMakin was always a more convincing sort of a person when he had been drinking a little than when he was sober
He lacked warmthhe lacked temperament
I suppose just the right amount put it into him
It put the devil into him too I reckon
He told me that you and he Tom had been to Clarksville and had made investigations and that the wedding was a fraud
And he told it with a wealth of convincing detail
In the midst of it he broke off to ask to see my wedding certificate
As he talked he laughed at it and tore it up saying that the thing was not worth the paper it was on and he threw the pieces of paper into the grate
I listened and I let him do itnot that the paper itself mattered particularly
But the very fact that I let him tear it showed me myself that I was believing him
He ended with an impassioned appeal to me to go with him
I showed him the door
I pretended to the last that I thought he was lying to me
But I did not think so
I believed him
He had done it all very cleverly
You can understand how I might in view of what had happened
I wanted to see Miss Lucyhow she looked when she said different things so I could make up my mind whether she was forgiving the doctor or not
Not that I had much doubt but what they would get their personal troubles fixed up in the end
The iron grating in the floor was held down by four goodsized screws one at each corner
They wasnt no filling at all betwixt it and the iron grating that was in the ceiling of the room below
The space was hollow
I got an idea and took out my jackknife
What are you going to do
whispers Martha
Sshsh I says shut up and youll see
One of the screws was loose and I picked her out easy enough
The second one I broke the point off of my knife blade on
Like you nearly always do on a screw
When it snapped Colonel Tom he says Whats that
He was powerful quick of hear ing Colonel Tom was
I laid low till they went on talking agin
Then Martha slides out on tiptoe and comes back in three seconds with one of these here little screwdrivers they use around sewingmachines and the little oil can that goes with it
I oils them screws and has them out in a holy minute and lifts the grating from the floor careful and lays it careful on the rug
By doing all of which I could get my head and shoulders down into that there hole
And by twist ing my neck a good deal see a little ways to each side into the room instead of jest underneath the grating
The doctor I couldnt see yet and only a little of Colonel Tom but Miss Lucy quite plain
You mean thing Martha whispers you are blocking it up so I cant hear
Keep still I whispers pulling my head out of the hole so the sound wouldnt float downward into the room below
You are jest like all other womenyou got too much curiosity
How about yourself
says she
Who was it thought of taking the grating off
I whispers back to her
Which settles her tem porary but she says if I dont give her a chancet at it purty soon she will tickle my ribs
When I listens agin they are burying that there Prent McMakin
But without any flowers
Miss Lucy she was half setting on half leaning against the arm of a chair
Which her head was jest a bit bowed down so that I couldnt see her eyes
But they was the beginnings of a smile onto her face
It was both soft and sad
Well says Colonel Tom you two have wasted almost twenty years of life
There is one good thing says the doctor
It is a good thing that there was no child to suffer by our mistakes
She raised her face when he said that Miss Lucy did and looked in his direction
You call that a good thing
she says in a kind of wonder
And after a minute she sighs
Per haps she says you are right
Heaven only knows
Perhaps it WAS better that he died
DIED
sings out the doctor
And I hearn his chair scrape back like he had riz to his feet sudden
I nearly busted my neck trying fur to see him but I couldnt
I was all twisted up head down and the blood getting into my head from it so I had to pull it out every little while
Yes she says with her eyes wide didnt you know he died
And then she turns quick toward Colonel Tom
Didnt you tell him she begins
But the doctor cuts in
Lucy he says his voice shaking and croaking in his throat I never knew there was a child
I hears Colonel Tom hawk in HIS throat like a man who is either going to spit or else say something
But he dont do either one
No one says anything fur a minute
And then Miss Lucy says agin Yeshe died
And then she fell into a kind of a muse
I have been myself in the fix she looked to be in thenso you forget fur a while where you are or who is there whilst you think about something that has been in the back part of your mind fur a long long time
What she was musing about was that child that hadnt lived
I could tell that by her face
I could tell how she must have thought of it often and often fur years and years and longed fur it so that it seemed to her at times she could almost touch it
And how good a mother she would of been to it
Some women has jest natcherally GOT to mother something or other
Miss Lucy was one of that kind
I knowed all in a flash whilst I looked at her there why she had adopted Martha fur her child
It was a wonderful look that was onto her face
And it was a wonderful face that look was onto
I felt like I had knowed her forever when I seen her there
Like the thoughts of her the doctor had been carrying around with him fur years and years and that I had caught him thinking oncet or twicet had been my thoughts too all my life
Miss Lucy she was one of the kind theres no use trying to describe
The feller that could see her thataway and not feel made good by it orter have a whaling
Not the kind of sticky good feeling that makes you uncomfortable like being pestered by your conscience to jine a church or quit cussing
But the kind of good that makes you forget they is anything on earth but jest braveness of heart and being willing to bear things you cant help
You knowed the world had hurt her a lot when you seen her standing there but you didnt have the nerve to pity her none either
Fur you could see she had got over pitying herself
Even when she was in that muse longing with all her soul fur that child she had never knowed you didnt have the nerve to pity her none
He died she says agin purty soon with that gentle kind of smile
Colonel Tom he clears his throat agin
Like when you are awful dry
The truth is he begins
And then he breaks off agin
Miss Lucy turns toward him when he speaks
By the strange look that come onto her face there must of been some thing right curious in HIS manner too
I was jest simply laying onto my forehead mashing one of my dern eyeballs through a little hole in the grating
But I couldnt even that way see fur enough to one side to see how HE looked
The truth is says Colonel Tom trying it agin that Iwell Lucy the child may be dead but he didnt die when you thought he did
There was a flash of hope flared into her face that I hated to see come there
Because when it died out in a minute as I expected it would have to it looked to me like it might take all her life out with it
Her lips parted like she was going to say something with them
But she didnt
She jest looked it
Why did you never tell me thisthat there was a child
says the doctor very eager
Wait says Colonel Tom let me tell the story in my own way
Which he done it
It seems when he had went to Galesburg this here child had only been born a few days
And Miss Lucy was still sick
And the kid itself was sick and liable to die any minute by the looks of things
Which Colonel Tom wishes that it would die in his heart
He thinks that it is an illegitimate child and he hates the idea of it and he hates the sight of it
The second night he is there he is setting in his sisters room and the woman that has been nursing the kid and Miss Lucy too is in the next room with the kid
She comes to the door and beckons to him the nurse does
He tiptoes toward her and she says to him very lowvoiced that it is all over
Meaning the kid has quit struggling fur to live and jest natcherally floated away
The nurse had thought Miss Lucy asleep but as both her and Colonel Tom turn quick toward her bed they see that she has heard and seen and she turns her face toward the wall
Which he tries fur to comfort her Colonel Tom does telling her as how it is an illegitimate child and fur its own sake it was better it was dead before it ever lived any
Which she dont answer of him back but only stares in a wild eyed way at him and lays there and looks desperate and says nothing
In his heart Colonel Tom is awful glad that it is dead
He cant help feeling that way
And he quits trying to talk to his sister fur he suspicions that she will ketch onto the fact that he is glad that it is dead
He goes on into the next room
He finds the nurse looking awful funny and bending over the dead kid
She is putting a look ingglass to its lips
He asts her why
She says she thought she might be mistaken after all
She couldnt say jest WHEN it died
It was alive and feeble and then purty soon it showed no signs of life
It was like it hadnt had enough strength to stay and had jest went
I didnt show any pulse and it didnt appear to be breathing
And she had watched it and done everything be fore she beckoned to Colonel Tom and told him that it was dead
But as she come back into the room where it was she thought she noticed something that was too light to be called a real flutter move its eyelids which she had closed down over its eyes
It was the ghost of a move like it had tried to raise the lids or they had tried to raise theirselves and had been too weak
So she has got busy and wrapped a hot cloth around it and got a drop of brandy or two between its lips and was fighting to bring it back to life
And thought she was doing it
Thought she had felt a little flutter in its chest and was trying if it had breath at all
Colonel Tom thinks of what big folks the Buckner fambly has always been at home
And how high they had always held their heads
And how none of the women has ever been like this before
Nor no disgrace of any kind
And that there kid if it is alive is a sign of disgrace
And he hoped to God he said it wasnt alive
But he dont say so
He stands there and watches that nurse fight fur to hold onto the little mist of life she thinks now is still into it
She un buttons her dress and lays the kid against the heat of her own breast
And wills fur it to live and fights fur it to and determines that it must and jest natcherally tries fur to bullyrag death into going away
And Colonel Tom watching and wishing that it wouldnt
But he gets interested in that there fight and so purty soon he is hoping both ways by spells
And the fight all going on without a word spoken
But finally the nurse begins fur to cry
Not be cause she is sure it is dead
But because she is sure it is coming back
Which it does slow
But I have told HER that it is dead says Colonel Tom jerking his head toward the other room where Miss Lucy is lying
He speaks in a low voice and closes the door when he speaks
Fur it looks now like it was getting strong enough so it might even squall a little
I dont know what kind of a look there was on my face says Colonel Tom telling of the story to his sister and the doctor but she must have seen that I wasand heaven help me but I WASsorry that the baby was alive
It would have been such an easy way out of it had it been really dead
She mustnt know that it is living I said to the nurse finally says Colonel Tom going on with his story
I had been watching Miss Lucys face as Colonel Tom talked and she was so worked up by that fight fur the kids life she was breath less
But her eyes was cast down I guess so her brother couldnt see them
Colonel Tom goes on with his story You dont mean said the nurse startled
No
No
I said of coursenot that
But why should she ever know that it didnt die
It is illegitimate
asked the nurse
Yes I said
The long and short of it was Colonel Tom went on to tell that the nurse went out and got her mother
Which the two of them lived alone only around the corner
And give the child into the keeping of her mother who took it away then and there
Colonel Tom had made up his mind there wasnt going to be no bastards in the Buckner fambly
And now that Miss Lucy thought it was dead he would let her keep on thinking so
And that would be settled for good and all
He figgered that it wouldnt ever hurt her none if she never knowed it
The nurses mother kept it all that week and it throve
Colonel Tom was coaxing of his sister to go back to Tennessee
But she wouldnt go
So he had made up his mind to go back and get his Aunt Lucy Davis to come and help him coax
He was only waiting fur his sister to get well enough so he could leave her
She got better and she never ast fur the kid nor said nothing about it
Which was probable because she seen he hated it so
He had made up his mind before he went back after their Aunt Lucy Davis to take the baby himself and put it into some kind of an institution
I thought he says to Miss Lucy telling of the story that you yourself were almost reconciled to the thought that it hadnt lived
Miss Lucy interrupted him with a little sound
She was breathing hard and shaking from head to foot
No one would have thought to look at her then she was reconciled to the idea that it hadnt lived
It was cruel hard on her to tear her to pieces with the news that it really had lived but had lived away from her all these years she had been longing fur it
And no chancet fur her ever to mother it
And no way to tell what had ever become of it
I felt awful sorry fur Miss Lucy then
But when I got ready to leave Galesburg Colonel Tom goes on it suddenly occurred to me that there would be difficulties in the way of putting it in a home of any sort
I didnt know what to do with it What DID you
What DID you
WHAT DID YOU
cries out Miss Lucy pressing her hand to her chest like she was smothering
The first thing I did says Colonel Tom was to get you to another houseyou remember Lucy
Yes yes
she says excited and what then
Perhaps I did a very foolish thing says Colonel Tom
After I had seen you installed in the new place and had bidden you goodbye I got a carriage and drove by the place where the nurse and her mother lived
I told the woman that I had changed my mindthat you were going to raise the baby that I was going to permit it
I dont think she quite believed me but she gave me the baby
What else could she do
Besides I had paid her well when I discharged her to say nothing to you and to keep the baby until I should come for it
They needed money they were poor
I was determined that it should never be heard of again
It was about noon when I left Galesburg
I drove all that afternoon with the baby in a basket on the seat of the carriage beside me
Everybody has read in books since books were first written and seen in newspapers tooabout children being left on door steps
Given an infant to dispose of that is perhaps the first thing that occurs to a per son
There was a thick plaid shawl wrapped about the child
In the basket beside the baby was a nursing bottle
About dusk I had it refilled with warm milk at a farmhouse near My head was beginning fur to swim
I pulled my head out of that there hole and rammed my foot into it
It banged against that grating and loosened it
It busted loose some plaster which showered down into the room underneath
Miss Lucy she screamed
And the doctor and Colonel Tom both yelled out to oncet Whos that
Its me I yells banging that grating agin
Watch out below there
And the third lick I give her she broke loose and clattered down right onto a centre table and spilled over some pho tographs and a vase full of flowers and bounced off onto the floor
Look out below I yells Im coming down
I let my legs through first and swung them so I would land to one side of the table and held by my hands and dropped
But struck the table a side ways swipe and turned it over and fell onto the floor
The doctor he grabbed me by the collar and straightened me up and give me a shake and stood me onto my feet
What do you mean he begins
But I breaks in
Now then I says to Colonel Tom did you leave that there child sucking that there bottle on the doorstep of a blacksmiths house next to his shop at the edge of a little country town about twenty miles northeast of Galesburg wrapped up in that there plaid shawl
I did says Colonel Tom
Then says I turning to Miss Lucy I can understand why I have been feeling drawed to YOU fur quite a spell
Im him
