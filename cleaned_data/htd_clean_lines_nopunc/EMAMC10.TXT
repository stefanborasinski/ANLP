SISTERS UNDER THEIR SKIN VII
AN ETUDE FOR EMMA EMMA McCHESNEY  CO
I BROADWAY TO BUENOS AIRES The door marked MRS MCCHESNEY was closed
T A Buck president of the Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company coming gaily down the hall stopped before it dismayed as one who with a spicy bit of news at his tongues end is met with rebuff before the first syllable is voiced
That closed door meant Busy
Keep out
Shell be reading a letter T A Buck told himself grimly
Then he turned the knob and entered his partners office
Mrs Emma McChesney was reading a letter
More than that she was poring over it so that at the interruption she glanced up in a maddeningly halfcocked manner which conveyed the impression that while her physical eye beheld the intruder her mental eye was still on the letter
I knew it said T A Buck morosely
Emma McChesney put down the letter and smiled
Sit downnow that youre in
And if you expect me to say Knew what
youre doomed to disappointment
T A Buck remained standing both gloved hands clasping his walking stick on which he leaned
Every time I come into this office youre reading the latest scrawl from your son
One would think Jocks letters were deathless masterpieces
I believe you read them at halfhour intervals all week and on Sunday get em all out and play solitaire with them
Emma McChesneys smile widened frankly to a grin
You make me feel like a cashgirl whos been caught flirting with the elevator starter
Have I been neglecting business
Business
No youve been neglecting me
Now T A youve just come from the tailors and I suppose it didnt fit in the back
It isnt that interrupted Buck and you know it
Look here
That day Jock went away and we came back to the office and you said I know I said it T A but dont remind me of it
That wasnt a fair test
I had just seen Jock leave me to take his own place in the world
You know that my day began and ended with him
He was my reason for everything
When I saw him off for Chicago that day and knew he was going there to stay it seemed a million miles from New York
I was blue and lonely and heartsick
If the officeboy had thrown a kind word to me Id have broken down and wept on his shoulder
Buck still standing looked down between narrowed lids at his business partner
Emma McChesney he said steadily do you mean that
Mrs McChesney the straightforward looked up looked down fiddled with the letter in her hand
Wellpractically yesthat isI thought now that youre going to the mountains for a month it might give me a chance to thinkto And dyou know what Ill do meanwhile out of revenge on the sex
Ive just ordered three suits of white flannel and I shall break every feminine heart in the camp regardless Oh say thats what I came in to tell you
Guess whom I saw at the tailors
Well Mr Bones whom did you and so forth
Fat Ed Meyers
I just glimpsed him in one of the fittingrooms
And they were draping him in white
Emma McChesney sat up with a jerk
Are you sure
Sure
Theres only one figure like that
He had the thing on and was surveying himself in the mirroror as much of himself as could be seen in one ordinary mirror
In that white suit with his red face above it he looked like those pictures you see labeled Sunrise on Snowcovered Mountain
 Did he see He dodged when he saw me
Actually
At least he seems to have the decency to be ashamed of the deal he gave us when he left us flat in the thick of his Middle Western trip and went back to the SansSilk Skirt Company
I wanted him to know I had seen him
As I passed I said Youll mow em down in those clothes Meyers
 Buck sat down in his leisurely fashion and laughed his low pleasant laugh
Cant you see him Emma at the seashore
But something in Emma McChesneys eyes and something in her set unsmiling face told him that she was not seeing seashores
She was staring straight at him straight through him miles beyond him
There was about her that tense electric breathless air of complete detachment which always enveloped her when her lightning mind was leaping ahead to a goal unguessed by the slower thinking
Whats your tailors name
Name
Trotter
Why
Emma McChesney had the telephone operator before he could finish
Get me Trotter the tailor Trodouble ter Say I want to speak to the tailor who fits Mr Ed Meyers of the SansSilk Skirt Company
T A Buck leaned forward mouth open eyes wide
Well what in the name of Ill let you know in a minute
Maybe Im wrong
Its just one of my hunches
But for ten years I sold Featherlooms through the same territory that Ed Meyers was covering for the SansSilk Skirt people
It didnt take me ten years to learn that Fat Ed hadnt the decency to be ashamed of any deal he turned no matter how raw
And let me tell you T A If he dodged when he saw you it wasnt because he was ashamed of having played us lowdown
He was contemplating playing lowerdown
Of course I may be She picked up the receiver in answer to the bell
Then sweetly her calm eyes smiling into Bucks puzzled ones Hello
Is this Mr Meyers tailor
Im to ask if you are sure that the grade he selected is the proper weight for the tropics
What
Oh you say you assured him it was the weight of flannel you always advise for South America
And you said theyd be ready when
Next week
Thank you
She hung up the receiver
The pupils of her eyes were dilated
Her cheeks were very pink as always under excitement
She stood up her breath coming rather quickly
Hurray for the hunch
It holds
Fat Ed Meyers is going down to South America for the SansSilk Company
Its what Ive been planning to do for the last six months
You remember I spoke of it
You poohpoohed the idea
It means hundreds of thousands of dollars to the SansSilk people if they get it
But they wont get it
T A Buck stood up suddenly
Look here Emma
If youre I certainly am
Nothing can stop me
The skirt business has beenwell you know what its been for the last two years
The South American boats sail twice a month
Fat Ed Meyers clothes are promised for next week
That means he isnt sailing until week after next
But the next boat sails in three days
She picked up a piece of paper from her desk and tossed it into Bucks hand
Thats the letter I was reading when you came in
No dont read it
Let me tell you instead
Buck threw cane hat gloves and letter on the broad desk thrust his hands into his pockets and prepared for argument
But he got only as far as But I wont allow it
You couldnt get away in three days at any rate
And at the end of two weeks youll have come to your senses and besides T A I dont mean to be rude
But here are your hat and stick and gloves
Its going to take me just fortyeight hours to mobilize
But Emma even if you do get in ahead of Meyers its an insane idea
A woman cant go down there alone
It isnt safe
Its bad enough for a man to tackle it
Besides were holding our own
Thats just it
When a doctor issues a bulletin to the effect that the patient is holding his own you may have noticed that the relatives always begin to gather
Its a bubble this South American idea
Oshkosh and Southport and Altoona money has always been good enough for us
If we can keep that trade we ought to be thankful
Emma McChesney pushed her hair back from her forehead with one gesture and patted it into place with another
Those two gestures to one who knew her meant loss of composure for one instant followed by the quick regaining of it the next
Lets not argue about it now
Suppose we wait until tomorrowwhen its too late
I am thankful for the trade weve got
But I dont want to be narrow about it
My thanking capacity is such that I can stretch it out to cover some things we havent got yet
Ive been reading up on South America
Reading
put in Buck hotly
What actual firsthand information can you get about a country from books
Well then I havent only been reading
Ive been talking to everyone I could lay my hands on who has been down there and who knows
Those South American women love dressespecially the Argentines
And do you know what theyve been wearing
Petticoats made in England
You know what that means
An English woman chooses a petticoat like she does a husbandfor life
It isnt only a garment
Its a shelter
Its built like a tent
If once I can introduce the T A Buck Featherloom petticoat and knickerbocker into sunny South America theyll use those English and German petticoats for linoleum floorcoverings
Heaven knows theyll fit the floor better than the human form
But Buck was unsmiling
The muscles of his jaw were tense
I wont let you go
Understand that
I wont allow it
Tut tut T A
What is this
Caveman stuff
Emma I tell you its dangerous
It isnt worth the risk no matter what it brings us
Emma McChesney struck an attitude hand on heart 
Heaven will protect the working girrul  she sang
Buck grabbed his hat
Im going to wire Jock
All right
Thatll save me fifty cents
Do you know what hell wire back
Go to it
Get the tango on its native tairnor words to that effect
Emma use a little logic and common sense
There was a note in Bucks voice that brought a quick response from Mrs McChesney
She dropped her little air of gayety
The pain in his voice and the hurt in his eyes and the pleading in his whole attitude banished the smile from her face
It had not been much of a smile anyway
T A knew her genuine smiles well enough to recognize a counterfeit at sight
And Emma McChesney knew that he knew
She came over and laid a hand lightly on his arm
T A I dont know anything about logic
It is a hothouse plant
But common sense is a field flower and Ive gathered whole bunches of it in my years of business experience
Im not going down to South America for a lark
Im going because the time is ripe to go
Im going because the future of our business needs it
Im going because its a job to be handled by the most experienced salesman on our staff
And Im just that
I say it because its true
Your father T A used to see things straighter and farther than any business man I ever knew
Since his death made me a partner in this firm I find myself when Im troubled or puzzled trying to see a situation as hed see it if he were alive
Its like having an expert stand back of you in a game of cards showing you the next move
Thats the way Im playing this hand
And I think were going to take most of the tricks away from Fat Ed Meyers
T A Bucks eyes traveled from Emma McChesneys earnest glowing face to the hand that rested on his arm
He reached over and gently covered that hand with his own
I suppose you must be right little woman
You always are
Dad was the founder of this business
It was the pride of his life
That word founder has two meanings
I never want to be responsible for its second meaning in connection with this concern
You never will be T
A
Not with you at the helm
He smiled rather sadly
Im a good ordinary common seaman
But youve got imagination and foresight and nerve and daring and thats the stuff that admirals are made of
Bless you T A
I knew youd see the thing as I do after the first shock was over
It has always been nip and tuck between the SansSilk Company and us
You gave me the hint that showed me their plans
Now help me follow it up
Buck picked up his hat squared his shoulders and fumbled with his gloves like a bashful schoolboy
Youyou couldnt kill two birds with one stone on this trip could you Mrs
Mack
Mrs McChesney back at her desk again threw him an inquiring glance over her shoulder
You might make it a combination honeymoon and Featherloom expedition
T A
Buck
exclaimed Emma McChesney
Then as Buck dodged for the door Just for that Im going to break this to you
You know that I intended to handle the Middle Western territory for one trip or until we could get a man to take Fat Ed Meyers place
Well
said Buck apprehensively
I leave in three days
Goodness knows how long Ill be gone
A business deal down there is a ceremony
Andyou wont need any whiteflannel clothes in Rock Island Illinois
Buck aghast faced her from the doorway
You mean I Just that smiled Emma McChesney pleasantly
And pressed the button that summoned the stenographer
In the next fortyeight hours Mrs McChesney performed a series of mental and physical calisthenics that would have landed an ordinary woman in a sanatorium
She cleaned up with the thoroughness and dispatch of a housewife who before going to the seashore forgets not instructions to the iceman the milkman the janitor and the maid
She surveyed her territory behind and before as a general studies troops and countryside before going into battle she foresaw factory emergencies dictated office policies made sure of staff organization like the business woman she was
Out in the stockroom under her supervision there was scientifically packed into sampletrunks and cases a line of Featherloom skirts and knickers calculated to dazzle Brazil and entrance Argentina
And into her own personal trunk there went a wardrobe each article of which was a garment with a purpose
Emma McChesney knew the value of a smartly tailored suit in a business argument
T A Buck canceled his order at the tailors made up his own line for the Middle West and prepared to storm that prosperous and important territory for the first time in his business career
The South American boat sailed Saturday afternoon
Saturday morning found the two partners deep in one of those condensed lastminute discussions
Mrs McChesney opened a desk drawer took out a leathercovered pocket notebook and handed it to Buck
A tiny smile quivered about her lips
Buck took it mystified
Your last diary
Something much more important
I call it The Salesmans Whos Who
Read it as you ought your Bible
But what
Buck turned the pages wonderingly
He glanced at a paragraph frowned read it aloud slowly
Des Moines Iowa Klein  Company
Miss Ella Sweeney skirt buyer
Old girl
Skittish
Wants to be entertained
Take her to dinner and the theater
He looked up dazed
Good Lord what is this
A joke
Wait until you see Ella you wont think its a joke
Shell buy only your smoothest numbers ask sixty days dating and expect you to entertain her as you would your rich aunt
Buck returned to the little book dazedly
He flipped another leafanother
Then he read in a stunned sort of voice Sam Bloom Paris Emporium Duluth
See Sadie
He closed the book
Say see here Emma do you mean to Sam is the manager interrupted Mrs McChesney pleasantly and he thinks he does the buying but the brains of that business is a little girl named Sadie Harris
Shes a wonder
Five years from now if she doesnt marry Sam shell be one of those tenthousandayear foreign buyers
Play your samples up to Sammy but quote your prices down to Sadie
Read the next one T
A
Buck read on his tone lifeless Miss Sharp
Berg Brothers Omaha
Strictly business
Known among the trade as the human cactus
Canceled a tenthousanddollar order once because the grateful salesman called her girlie
Stick to skirts
Buck slapped the book smartly against the palm of his hand
Do you mean to tell me that you made this book out for me
Do you mean to say that I have to cram on this like a kid studying for exams
That Ill have to cater to the personality of the person Im selling to
Whyitsits Emma McChesney nodded calmly
I dont know how this trip of yours is going to affect the firms business T A
But its going to be a liberal education for you
Youll find that youll need that little book a good many times before youre through
And while youre following its advice do this forget that your name is Buck except for business purposes forget that your family has always lived in a brownstone mausoleum in Seventysecond street forget that you like your chops done just so and your wine at suchandsuch a temperature get close to your trade
Theyre an awfully human lot those Middle Western buyers
Dont chuck them under the chin but smile on em
And youve got a lovely smile T
A
Buck looked up from the little leather book
And as he gazed at Emma McChesney the smile appeared and justified its praise
Ill have this to comfort me anyway Emma
Ill know that while Im smirking on the sprightly Miss Sweeney your face will be undergoing various agonizing twists in the effort to make American prices understood by an Argentine who cant speak anything but Spanish
Maybe I am short on Spanish but Im long on Featherlooms
I may not know a senora from a chili con carne but I know Featherlooms from the waistband to the hem
She leaned forward dimpling like fourteen instead of forty
And youve noticedhavent you T
Athat Ive got an expressive countenance
Buck leaned forward too
His smile was almost gone
Ive noticed a lot of things Emma McChesney
And if you persist in deviling me for one more minute Im going to mention a few
Emma McChesney surveyed her cleared desk locked the top drawer with a snap and stood up
If you do Ill miss my boat
Just time to make Brooklyn
Suppose you write em
That Ed Meyers might know nothing of her sudden plans she had kept the trip secret
Besides Buck and the office staff her son Jock was the only one who knew
But she found her cabin stocked like a prima donnas on a farewell tour
There were boxes of flowers a package of books baskets of fruit piles of magazines even a neat little sheaf of telegrams one from the faithful bookkeeper one from the workroom foreman two from salesmen long in the firms employ two from Jock in Chicago
She read them her face glowing
He and Buck had vied with each other in supplying her with luxuries that would make pleasanter the twentythree days of her voyage
She looked about the snug cabin her eyes suddenly misty
Buck poked his head in at the door
Come on up on deck Emma Ive only a few minutes left
She snatched a pink rose from the box and together they went on deck
Just ten minutes said Buck
He was looking down at her
Remember Emma nothing that concerns the firms business however big is half as important as the things that concern you personally however small
I realize what this trip will mean to us if it pans and if you can beat Meyers to it
But if anything should happen to you why Nothings going to happen T A except that Ill probably come home with my complexion ruined
Ill feel a great deal more at home talking pidginEnglish to Senor Alvarez in Buenos Aires than you will talking Featherlooms to Miss SkirtBuyer in Cedar Rapids Iowa
But remember this T A When you get to knowreally to knowthe Sadie Harrises and the Sammy Blochs and the Ella Sweeneys of this world youve learned just about all there is to know about human beings
Quickthe gangplank
Goodby T
A
The dock reached he gazed up at her as she leaned far over the railing
He made a megaphone of his hands
I feel like an old maid whos staying home with her knitting he called
The boat began to move
Emma McChesney passed a quick hand over her eyes
Dont drop any stitches T
A
With unerring aim she flung the big pink rose straight at him
She went about arranging her affairs on the boat like the business woman that she was
First she made her cabin shipshape
She placed nearest at hand the books on South America and the SpanishAmerican pocket interpreter
She located her deck chair and her seat in the diningroom
Then quietly unobtrusively and guided by those years spent in meeting men and women face to face in business she took thorough conscientious mental stock of those others who were to be her fellow travelers for twenty three days
For the most part the firstclass passengers were men
There were American business mensalesmen some of them promoters others or representatives of big syndicates shrewd alert well dressed smooth shaven
Emma McChesney knew that she would gain valuable information from many of them before the trip was over
She sighed a little regretfully as she thought of those smokingroom talksthose intimate tobaccomellowed business talks from which she would be barred by her sex
There were two engineers one British one American both very intelligentlooking both inclined to taciturnity as is often the case in men of their profession
They walked a good deal and smoked nutbrown evilsmelling pipes and stared unblinkingly across the water
There were Argentineswhole families of themBrazilians too
The fat bejeweled Brazilian men eyed Emma McChesney with open approval even talked to her leering objectionably
Emma McChesney refused to be annoyed
Her ten years on the road served her in good stead now
But most absorbing of all to Emma McChesney watching quietly over her book or magazine was a tall erect whitebearded Argentine who with his family occupied chairs near hers
His name had struck her with the sound of familiarity when she read it on the passenger list
She had asked the decksteward to point out the names owner
Pages she repeated to herself worriedly Pages
P Suddenly she knew
Pages y Hernandez the owner of the great Buenos Aires shopa shop finer than those of Paris
And this was Pages
All the Featherloom instinct in Emma McChesney came to the surface and stayed there seething
That was the morning of the second day out
By afternoon she had bribed and maneuvered so that her deck chair was next that of the Pagesfamily flock of chairs
Senor Pages reminded her of one of those dashing whitehaired distinguishedlooking men whose likeness graces the cover of a box of your favorite cigars
General Somethingorotherendinginz he should have been with a revolutionary background
He dressed somberly in black like most of the other Argentine men on board
There was Senora Pages very fat very indolent very blank much given to pink satin and diamonds at dinner
Senorita Pages overpowdered overfrizzed marvelously gowned with overplumpness just a few years away sat quietly by Senora Pages side but her darting flashing restless eyes were never still
The son Emma heard them call him Pepe was barely eighteen she thought but quite a man of the world with his cigarettes his drinks his bold eyes
She looked at his sallow pimpled skin his lean brown hands his lackluster eyes and she thought of Jock and was happy
Mrs McChesney knew that she might visit the magnificent Buenos Aires shop of Pages y Hernandez day after day for months without ever obtaining a glimpse of either Pages or Hernandez
And here was Senor Pages so near that she could reach out and touch him from her deck chair
Here was opportunity
A caller who had never been obliged to knock twice at Emma McChesneys door
Her methods were so simple that she herself smiled at them
She donned her choicest suit of white serge that she had been saving for shore wear
Its skirt had been cut by the very newest trick
Its coat was the kind to make you go home and get out your own white serge and gaze at it with loathing
Senorita Pages eyes leaped to that suit as iron leaps to the magnet
Emma McChesney passing her deck chair detached the eyes with a neat smile
Why hadnt she spent six months neglecting Skirts for Spanish
she asked herself groaning
As she approached her own deck chair again she risked a bright Good morning
Her heart bounded stood still bounded again as from the lips of the assembled Pages there issued a combined courteous perfectly good American Good morning
You speak English
Emma McChesneys tone expressed flattery and surprise
Pages pere made answer
Ah yes it is necessary
There are many English in Argentina
A sigha fluttering tremulous sigh of perfect peace and happinesswelled up from Emma McChesneys heart and escaped through her smiling lips
By noon Senorita Pages had tried on the fascinating coat and secured the address of its builder
By afternoon Emma McChesney was showing the newest embroidery stitch to the slow but docile Senora Pages
Next morning she was playing shuffleboard with the elegant indolent Pepe and talking North American football and baseball to him
She had not been Jock McChesneys mother all those years for nothing
She could discuss sports with the best of them
Young Pages was avidly interested
Outdoor sports had become the recent fashion among the rich young Argentines
The problem of papa Pages was not so easy
Emma McChesney approached her subject warily skirting the bypaths of politics war climate customsto business
Business
But a lady as charming as you can understand nothing of business said Senor Pages
Business is for your militant sisters
But we American women do understand business
Manymany charming American women are in business
Senor Pages turned his fine eyes upon her
She had talked most interestingly this pretty American woman
Perhapsbut pardon me if I think not
A woman cannot be really charming and also capable in business
Emma McChesney dimpled becomingly
But I know a woman who is aswell as charming as you say I am
Still she is known as a capable successful business woman
Shell be in Buenos Aires when I am
Senor Pages shook an unbelieving head
Emma McChesney leaned forward
Will you let me bring her in to meet you just to prove my point
She must be as charming as you are
His Argentine betting proclivities rose
Here we shall make a wager
He took a card from his pocket scribbled on it handed it to Emma McChesney
You will please present that to my secretary who will conduct you immediately to my office
We will pretend it is a friendly call
Your friend need not know
If I lose If you lose you must promise to let her show you her sample line
But dear madam I do no buying
Then you must introduce her favorably to the department buyer of her sort of goods
But if I win
persisted Senor Pages
If she isnt as charming asas you say I am you may make your own terms
Senor Pages fine eyes opened wide
It was on the fourteenth day of their trip that they came into quaint Bahia
The stay there was short
Brazilian business methods are long
Emma McChesney took no chances with sampletrunks or cases
She packed her three leading samples into her own personal suitcase eluded the other tourists secured an interpreter and prepared to brave Bahia
She returned just in time to catch the boat flushed tired and orderless
Bahia would have none of her
In three days they would reach Rio de Janeiro the magnificent
They would have three days there
She told herself that Bahia didnt count anywaysleepy little halfbreed town
But the arrow rankled
It had been the first to penetrate the armor of her business success
But she had learned things from that experience at Bahia
She had learned that the South American dislikes the North American because his Northern cousin patronizes him
She learned that the North American business firm is thought by the Southern business man to be tricky and dishonest and that because the Northerner has not learned how to pack a case of goods scientifically as have the English Germans and French the South American rages to pay cubicfeet rates on boxes that are threequarters empty
So it was with a heavy heart but a knowing head that she faced Rio de Janeiro
They had entered in the evening the sunset splashing the bay and the hills in the foreground and the Sugarloaf Mountain with an unbelievable riot of crimson and gold and orange and blue
Suddenly the sun jerked down as though pulled by a string and the magic purple night came up as though pulled by another
Well anyway Ive seen that breathed Emma McChesney thankfully
Next morning she packed her three samples as before her heart heavy her mind on Fat Ed Meyers coming up two weeks behind her
Three days in Rio
And already she had bumped her impatient quickthinking quickacting North American business head up against the stone wall of South American leisureliness and prejudice
She meant no irreverence no impiety as she prayed meanwhile packing Nos
79 65 and 48 into her personal bag O Lord let Fat Ed Meyers have Bahia but please please help me to land Rio and Buenos Aires
Then in smart tailored suit and hat interpreter in tow a prayer in her heart and excitement blazing in cheeks and eyes she made her way to the dock through the customs into a cab that was to take her to her arena the broad Avenida
Exactly two hours later there dashed into the customshouse a welldressed woman whose hat was very much over one ear
She was running as only a woman runs when shes made up her mind to get there
She came hotfoot helterskelter regardless of modishly crippling skirt past officers past customs officials into the section where stood the one small sampletrunk that she had ordered down in case of emergency
The trunk had not gone through the customs
It had not even been opened
But Emma McChesney heeded not trifles like that
Rio de Janeiro had fallen for Featherlooms
Those three samples Nos
79 65 and 48 that boasted style cut and workmanship never before seen in Rio had turned the trick
They were as a taste of blood to a hungry lion
Rio wanted more
Emma McChesney was kneeling before her trunk had whipped out her key unlocked it and was swiftly selecting the numbers wanted from the trays her breath coming quickly her deft fingers choosing unerringly when an indignant voice said in Portuguese It is forbidden
Emma McChesney did not glance around
Her head was buried in the depths of the trunk
But her quick ears had caught the word PROHIBA
Speak English she said and went on unpacking
INGLES
shouted the official
No
Then with a superhuman effort as Emma McChesney stood up her arms laden with Featherloom samples of rainbow hues PARE
Arrrrest
Mrs McChesney slammed down the trunk top locked it clutched her samples firmly and faced the enraged official
Go way
I havent time to be arrested this morning
This is my busy day
Call around this evening
Whereupon she fled to her waiting cab leaving behind her a Brazilian official stunned and raging by turns
When she returned happy triumphant orderladen he was standing there stunned no longer but raging still
Emma McChesney had forgotten all about him
The goldbraided official advanced mustachios bristling
A volley of Portuguese burst from his longpent lips
Emma McChesney glanced behind her
Her interpreter threw up helpless hands replying with a still more terrifying burst of vowels
Bewildered a little frightened Mrs McChesney stood helplessly by
The official laid a none too gentle hand on her shoulder
A little group of lesser officials stood comicopera fashion in the background
And then Emma McChesneys New York training came to her aid
She ignored the voluble interpreter
She remained coolly unruffled by the fusillade of Portuguese
Quietly she opened her hand bag and plunged her fingers deep deep therein
Her blue eyes gazed confidingly up into the Brazilians snapping black ones and as she withdrew her hand from the depths of her purse there passed from her white fingers to his brown ones that which is the Esperanto of the nations the universal language understood from Broadway to Brazil
The hand on her shoulder relaxed and fell away
On deck once more she encountered the suave Senor Pages
He stood at the rail surveying Rios shores with that lipcurling contempt of the Argentine for everything Brazilian
He regarded Emma McChesneys radiant face
You are pleased with thisthis Indian Rio
Mrs McChesney paused to gaze with him at the receding shores
Like it
Im afraid I havent seen it
From here it looks like Coney
But it buys like Seattle
Like it
Well I should say I do
Ah senora exclaimed Pages distressed wait
In six days you will behold Buenos Aires
Your New York Londres Parisbah
You shall drive with my wife and daughter through Palermo
You shall see jewels motors toilettes as never before
And you will visit my establishment
He raised an emphatic forefinger
But surely
Emma McChesney regarded him solemnly
I promise to do that
You may rely on me
Six days later they swept up the muddy and majestic Plata whose color should have won it the name of River of Gold instead of River of Silver
From the boats upper deck Emma McChesney beheld a sky line which was so like the sky line of her own New York that it gave her a shock
She was due for still another shock when an hour later she found herself in a maelstrom of motors cabs street cars newsboys skyscrapers pedestrians policemen subway stations
Where was the South American languor
Where the Argentine inertia
The rush and roar of it the bustle and the bang of it made the twentythreeday voyage seem a myth
Im going to shut my eyes she told herself and then open them quickly
If that little brown trafficpoliceman turns out to be a big redfaced trafficpoliceman then Im right and this IS Broadway and Fortysecond
Shock number three came upon her entrance at the Grande Hotel
It had been Emma McChesneys boast that her ten years on the road had familiarized her with every type grade style shape cut and mold of hotel clerk
She knew him from the Knickerbocker to the Eagle House at Waterloo Iowa
At the moment she entered the Grande Hotel she knew she had overlooked one
Accustomed though she was to the sartorial splendors of the man behind the desk she might easily have mistaken this one for the president of the republic
In his glittering uniform he looked a pass between the supreme chancellor of the KP
s in full regalia and a prince of India during the Durbar
He was regal
He was overwhelming
He would have made the most splendid specimen of North American hotel clerk look like a scullery boy
Mrs McChesney spent two whole days in Buenos Aires before she discovered that she could paralyze this personage with a peso
A peso is fortythree cents
Her experience at Bahia and at Rio de Janeiro had taught her things
So for two days haunted as she was by visions of Fat Ed Meyers coming up close behind her she possessed her soul in patience and waited
On the great firm of Pages y Hernandez rested the success of this expedition
When she thought of her little trick on Senor Pages her blithe spirits sank
Suppose after all that this powerful South American should resent her little Yankee joke
Her trunks went through the customs
She secured an interpreter
She arranged her samples with loving care
Style cut workmanshipshe ran over their strong points in her mind
She looked at them as a mothers eyes rest fondly on the shining faces the wellbrushed hair the clean pinafores of her brood
And her heart swelled with pride
They lay on their tables the artful knickerbockers the gleaming petticoats the pink and blue pajamas the bifurcated skirts
Emma McChesney ran one hand lightly over the navy blue satin folds of a sample
Pages or no Pages youre a credit to your mother she said whimsically
Up in her room once more she selected her smartest tailor costume her most modish hat the freshest of gloves and blouses
She chose the hours between four and six when wheel traffic was suspended in the Calle Florida and throughout the shoppingdistrict the narrow streets of which are congested to the point of suffocation at other times
As she swung down the street they turned to gaze after herthese Argentines
The fat senoras turned and the smartly costumed sallow senoritas and the menall of them
They spoke to her these last but she had expected that and marched on with her free swinging stride her chin high her color very bright
Into the great shop of Pages y Hernandez at last up to the private offices her breath coming a little quickly into the presence of the shiny secretaryshiny teeth shiny hair shiny skin shiny nails
He gazed upon Emma McChesney the shine gleaming brighter
He took in his slim brown fingers the card on which Senor Pages had scribbled that day on board ship
The shine became dazzling
He bowed low and backed his way into the office of Senor Pages
A successful man is most impressive when in those surroundings which have been built up by his success
On shipboard Senor Pages had been a genial charming distinguished fellow passenger
In his luxurious business office he still was genial charming but his environment seemed to lend him a certain austerity
Senora McChesney
How awful that sounds
Emma McChesney told herself
We spoke of you but last night
And now you come to win the wager yes
He smiled but shook his head
Yes replied Emma McChesney
And tried to smile too
Senor Pages waved a hand toward the outer office
She is with you this business friend who is also so charming
Oh yes said Emma McChesney shesshes with me
Then as he made a motion toward the pushbutton which would summon the secretary No dont do that
Wait a minute
From her bag she drew her business card presented it
Read that first
Senor Pages read it
He looked up
Then he read it again
He gazed again at Emma McChesney
Emma McChesney looked straight at him and tried in vain to remember ever having heard of the South Americans sense of humor
A moment passed
Her heart sank
Then Senor Pages threw back his fine head and laughedlaughed as the Latin laughs emphasizing his mirth with many ejaculations and gestures
Ah you Northerners
You are too quick for us
Come I myself must see this garment which you honor by selling
His glance rested approvingly on Emma McChesneys trim smart figure
That which you sell it must be quite right
I not only sell it said Emma McChesney I wear it
Thathow is it you Northerners sayah yesthat settles it
Six weeks later in his hotel room in Columbus Ohio T A Buck sat reading a letter forwarded from New York and postmarked Argentina
As he read he chuckled grew serious chuckled again and allowed his cigar to grow cold
For the seventh time DEAR T A Theyve fallen for Featherlooms the way an Eskimo takes to gumdrops
My letter of credit is all shot to pieces but it was worth it
They make you pay a separate license fee in each province and South America is just one darn province after another
If theyd lump a peddlers license for 5000 and tell you to go ahead it would be cheaper
I landed Pages y Hernandez by a trick
The best of it is the man I played it on saw the point and laughed with me
We North Americans brag too much about our sense of humor
I thought ten years on the road had hardened me to the most fiendish efforts of a hotel chef
But the food at the Grande here makes a quarterinch round steak with German fried look like Sherrys latest triumph
You know Im not fussy
Im the kind of woman who given her choice of ice cream or cheese for dessert will take cheese
Here given my choice I play safe and take neither
Ive reached the point where I make a meal of radishes
They kill their beef in the morning and serve it for lunch
It looks and tastes like an Ethiops ear
But I dont care because Im getting gorgeously thin
If the radishes hold out Ill invade Central America and Panama
Ive one eye on Valparaiso already
I know it sounds wild but it means a future and a fortune for Featherlooms
I find I dont even have to talk skirts
Theyre selfsellers
But I have to talk honesty and packing
How did you hit it off with Ella Sweeney
Havent seen a sign of Fat Ed Meyers
Im getting nervous
Do you think he may have exploded at the equator
EMMA
But kind fortune saw fit to add a last sweet drop to Emma McChesneys already brimming cup
As she reached the docks on the day of her departure clad in cool crisp white from hat to shoes her quick eye spied a redfaced rotund familiar figure disembarking from the New York boat just arrived
The fates grinning had planned this moment like a stagemanager
Fat Ed Meyers came heavily down the gangplank
His hat was off
He was mopping the top of his head with a large damp handkerchief
His gaze swept over the busy landingdocks darted hither and thither alighted on Emma McChesney with a shock and rested there
A distinct little shock went through that lady too
But she waited at the foot of her boats gangway until the unbelievably nimble Meyers reached her
He was a fiery spectacle
His cheeks were distended his eyes protuberant
He wasted no words
They understood each other those two
Coming or going
Going replied Emma McChesney
Clean up thisthis Bonez Areez too
Absolutely
Did huh
Meyers stood a moment panting his little eyes glaring into her calm ones
Well I beat you in Bahia anyway
he boasted
Emma McChesney snapped her fingers blithely
Bah for Bahia
She took a step or two up the gangplank and turned
Goodby Ed
And good luck
I can recommend the radishes but pass up the beef
Dangerous
Fat Ed Meyers still staring began to stutter unintelligibly his lips moving while no words came
Emma McChesney held up a warning hand
Dont do that Ed
Not in this climate
A man of your build too
Im surprised
Consider the feelings of your firm
Fat Ed Meyers glared up at the whiteclad smiling gracious figure
His hands unclenched
The words came
Oh if only you were a man for just ten minutes
he moaned
II THANKS TO MISS MORRISSEY It was Fat Ed Meyers of the SansSilk Skirt Company who first said that Mrs Emma McChesney was the Maude Adams of the business world
It was on the occasion of his being called to the carpet for his failure to make Sanssilks as popular as Emma McChesneys famed Featherlooms
He spoke in selfdefense heatedly
It isnt Featherlooms
Its McChesney
Her line is no better than ours
Its her personality not her petticoats
Shes got a following that swears by her
If Maude Adams was to open on Broadway in East Lynne theyd flock to see her wouldnt they
Well Emma McChesney could sell hoopskirts Im telling you
She could sell bustles
She could sell redwoolen mittens on Fifth Avenue
The title stuck
It was late in September when Mrs McChesney sunburned decidedly under weight but gloriously triumphant returned from a four months tour of South America
Against the earnest protests of her business partner T A Buck president of the Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company she had invaded the southern continent and left it abloom with Featherlooms from the Plata to the Canal
Success was no stranger to Mrs McChesney
This last business victory had not turned her head
But it had come perilously near to tilting that extraordinarily wellbalanced part
A certain light in her eyes a certain set of her chin an added briskness of bearing a cocky slant of the eyebrow revealed the fact that though Mrs McChesneys feet were still on the ground she might be said to be standing on tiptoe
When she had sailed from Brooklyn pier that June afternoon four months before she had cast her ordinary load of business responsibilities on the unaccustomed shoulders of T A Buck
That elegant person although president of the company which his father had founded had never been its real head
When trouble threatened in the workroom it was to Mrs McChesney that the forewoman came
When an irascible customer in Green Bay Wisconsin waxed impatient over the delayed shipment of a Featherloom order it was to Emma McChesney that his typewritten protest was addressed
When the office machinery needed mental oiling when a new hand demanded to be put on silkwork instead of mercerized when a consignment of skirtmaterial turned out to be more than usually metallic it was in Mrs Emma McChesneys little private office that the tangle was unsnarled
She walked into that little office now at nine oclock of a brilliant September morning
It was a reassuring room bright orderly workmanlike reflecting the personality of its owner
She stood in the center of it now and looked about her eyes glowing lips parted
She raised her hands high above her head then brought them down to her sides again with an unconsciously dramatic gesture that expressed triumph peace content relief accomplishment and a great and deep satisfaction
T A Buck in the doorway saw the gestureand understood
Not so bad to get back to it is it
Bad
Its like a drink of cool spring water after too much champagne
In those miserable South American hotels how I used to long for the orderliness and quiet of this
She took off hat and coat
In a vase on the desk a cluster of yellow chrysanthemums shook their shaggy heads in welcome
Emma McChesneys quick eye jumped to them then to Buck who had come in and was surveying the scene appreciatively
Youof course
She indicated the flowers with a nod and a radiant smile
Sorryno
The office staff did that
Theres a card of welcome I believe
Oh said Emma McChesney
The smile was still there but the radiance was gone
She seated herself at her desk
Buck took the chair near by
She unlocked a drawer opened it rummaged closed it again unlocked another
She patted the flat top of her desk with loving fingers
I cant help it she said with a little shamed laugh Im so glad to be back
Ill probably hug the forewoman and bite a piece out of the first Featherloom I lay hands on
I had to use all my selfcontrol to keep from kissing Jake the elevatorman coming up
Out of the corner of her eye Emma McChesney had been glancing at her handsome business partner
She had found herself doing the same thing from the time he had met her at the dock late in the afternoon of the day before
Those four months had wrought some subtle change
But what
Where
She frowned a moment in thought
Then Is that a new suit T
A
This
Lord no
Last summers
Put it on because of this July hangover in September
Why
Oh I dont knowvaguelyI justwondered
There was nothing vague about T A Buck however
His old air of leisureliness was gone
His very attitude as he sat there erect brisk confident was in direct contrast to his old graceful indolence
Id like to go over the home grounds with you this morning he said
Of course in our talk last night we didnt cover the South American situation thoroughly
But your letters and the orders told the story
You carried the thing through to success
Its marvelous
But we stayathomes havent been marking time during your absence
The puzzled frown still sat on Emma McChesneys brow
As though thinking aloud she said Have you grown thinner or fatter orsomething
Not an ounce
Weighed at the club yesterday
He leaned forward a little his face suddenly very sober
Emma I want to tell you now thatthat mothersheI lost her just a few weeks after you sailed
Emma McChesney gave a little cry
She came quickly over to him and one hand went to his shoulder as she stood looking down at him her face all sympathy and contrition and sorrow
And you didnt write me
You didnt even tell me last night
I didnt want to distress you
I knew you were having a hardenough pull down there without additional worries
It happened very suddenly while I was out on the road
I got the wire in Peoria
She died very suddenly and quite painlessly
Her companion Miss Tate was with her
She had never been herself since Dads death
And you I could only do what was to be done
Then I went back on the road
I closed up the house and now Ive leased it
Of course its big enough for a regiment
But we stayed on because mother was used to it
I sold some of the furniture but stored the things she had loved
She left some to you
To me
You know she used to enjoy your visits so much partly because of the way in which you always talked of Dad
She left you some jewelry that she was fond of and that colossal old mahogany buffet that you used to rave over whenever you came up
Heaven knows what youll do with it
Its a white elephant
If you add another story to it you could rent it out as an apartment
Indeed I shall take it and cherish it and polish it up myself every weekthe beauty
She came back to her chair
They sat a moment in silence
Then Emma McChesney spoke musingly
So that was it
Buck looked up
I sensed somethingdifferent
I didnt know
I couldnt explain it
Buck passed a quick hand over his eyes shook himself sat up erect and brisk again and plunged with a directness that was as startling as it was new in him into the details of Middle Western business
Good
exclaimed Emma McChesney
Its all very well to know that Featherlooms are safe in South America
But the important thing is to know how theyre going in the corn country
Buck stood up
Suppose we transfer this talk to my office
All the papers are there all the correspondenceall the orders everything
You can get the whole situation in half an hour
Whats the use of talking when figures will tell you
He walked swiftly over to the door and stood there waiting
Emma McChesney rose
The puzzled look was there again
No that wasnt it after all she said
Eh
said Buck
Wasnt what
Nothing replied Emma McChesney
Im woolgathering this morning
Im afraid its going to take me a day or two to get back into harness again
If youd rather wait if you think youll be more fit tomorrow or the day after well wait
Theres no real hurry
I just thought But Mrs McChesney led the way across the hall that separated her office from her partners
Halfway across she stopped and surveyed the big bright busy main office with its clacking typewriters and rustle and crackle of papers and its air of concentration
Why youve run up a partition there between Miss Caseys desk and the workroom door havent you
Yes its much better that way
Yes of course
Andwhy where are the boys desks
Spaldings and Hutchinsons andtheyre all gone
She turned in amazement
Break it to me
Arent we using traveling men any more
Buck laughed his low pleasant laugh
Oh yes but I thought their desks belonged somewhere else than in the main office
Theyre now installed in the little room between the shop and Healys office
Close quarters but better than having them out here where they were inclined to neglect their reports in order to shine in the eyes of that pretty new stenographer
There are one or two other changes
I hope youll approve of them
Im sure I shall replied Emma McChesney a little stiffly
In Bucks office she settled back in her chair to watch him as he arranged neat sheaves of papers for her inspection
Her eyes traveled from his keen eager face to the piles of paper and back again
Tell me did you hit it off with the Ella Sweeneys and the Sadie Harrises of the great Middle West
Is business as bad as the howlers say it is
You said something last night about a novelty bifurcated skirt
Was that the new designers idea
How have the early buyers taken to it
Buck crooked an elbow over his head in selfdefense
Stop it
You make me feel like Rheims cathedral
Dont bombard until negotiations fail
He handed her the first sheaf of papers
But before she began to read Ill say this much
Miss Sharp of Berg Brothers Omahathe one you warned against as the human cactushad me up for dinner
Well I know you dont but its true
Her father and I hit it off just like that
Hes a character that old boy
Ever meet him
No
And Miss Sharp told me something about herself that explains her porcupine pose
That poor child was engaged to a chap who was killed in the SpanishAmerican war and she Kate Sharp
interrupted Emma McChesney
Why T A Buck in all her vinegary narrow life that girl has never had a beau much less Bucks eyebrows came up slightly
Emma McChesney you havent developederclaws have you
With a gasp Emma McChesney plunged into the papers before her
For ten minutes the silence of the room was unbroken except for the crackling of papers
Then Emma McChesney put down the first sheaf and looked up at her business partner
Is that a fair sample
she demanded
Very answered T A Buck and handed her another set
Another ten minutes of silence
Emma McChesney reached out a hand for still another set of papers
The pink of repressed excitement was tinting her cheeks
Theyretheyre all like this
Practically yes
Mrs McChesney faced him her eyes wide her breath coming fast
T A Buck she slapped the papers before her smartly with the back of her hand this means youve broken our record for Middle Western sales
Yes said T A quietly
Dad would have enjoyed a morning like this wouldnt he
Emma McChesney stood up
Enjoyed it
He is enjoying it
Dont tell me that T A Senior just because he is no longer on earth has failed to get the joy of knowing that his son has realized his fondest dreams
Why I can feel him here in this room I can see those bright brown eyes of his twinkling behind his glasses
Not know it
Of course he knows it
Buck looked down at the desk smiling curiously
Dyou know I felt that way too
Suddenly Emma McChesney began to laugh
It was not all mirththat laugh
Buck waited
And to think that II kindly and patronizingly handed you a little book full of tips on how to handle Western buyers The Salesmans Whos WhoI who used to think I was the witch of the West when it came to selling
You on your first sellingtrip have made me look likelike a shoestring peddler
Buck put out a hand suddenly
Dont say that Emma
Isomehow it takes away all the pleasure
Its true
And now that I know it explains a lot of things that Ive been puzzling about in the last twentyfour hours
What kind of things
The way you look and act and think
The way you carry your head
The way you sit in a chair
The very words you use your gestures your intonations
Theyre different
T A Buck busy with his cigar laughed a little selfconsciously
Oh nonsense
he said
Youre imagining things
Which remark while not a particularly happy one certainly was not in itself so unfortunate as to explain why Mrs McChesney should have turned rather suddenly and bolted into her own office across the hall and closed the door behind her
T A Buck quite cool and unruffled viewed her sudden departure quizzically
Then he took his cigar from his mouth and stood eying it a moment with more attention perhaps than it deserved in spite of its fine aroma
When he put it back between his lips and sat down at his desk once more he was smiling ever so slightly
Then began a new order of things in the offices of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company
Feet that once had turned quite as a matter of course toward the door marked MRS MCCHESNEY now took the direction of the door oppositeand that door bore the name of Buck
Those four months of Mrs McChesneys absence had put her partner to the test
That acid test had washed away the accumulated dross of years and revealed the precious metal beneath
T A Buck had proved to be his fathers son
If Mrs McChesney noticed that the head office had miraculously moved across the hall if her sharp ears marked that the many feet that once had paused at her door now stopped at the door opposite if she realized that instead of Id like your opinion on this Mrs McChesney she often heard the new Ill ask Mr Buck she did not show it by word or sign
The first of October found buyers still flocking into New York from every State in the country
Shrewd men and women thesebargain hunters on a grand scale
Armed with the long spoon of business knowledge they came to skim the cream from factory and workroom products set forth for their inspection
For years it had been Emma McChesneys quiet boast that of those whose business brought them to the offices and showrooms of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company the foremost insisted on dealing only with her
She was proud of her following
She liked their loyalty
Their preference for her was the subtlest compliment that was in their power to pay
Ethel Morrissey whose friendship dated back to the days when Emma McChesney had sold Featherlooms through the Middle West used to say laughingly her plump comfortable shoulders shaking Emma if you ever give me away by telling how many years Ive been buying Featherlooms of you IllIll call down upon you the spinsters curse
Early Monday morning Mrs McChesney coming down the hall from the workroom encountered Miss Ella Sweeney of Klein  Company Des Moines Iowa stepping out of the elevator
A very skittish Miss Sweeney rustling preening conscious of her dangling black earrings and her Robespierre collar and her beautypatch
Emma McChesney met this apparition with outstretched welcoming hand
Ella Sweeney
Well Id almost given you up
Youre late this fall
Come into my office
She led the way not noticing that Miss Sweeney came reluctantly her eyes on the closed door across the way
Sit down said Emma McChesney and pulled a chair nearer her desk
No wait a minute
Let me look at you
Now Ella dont try to tell me that THAT dress came from Des Moines Iowa
Do I
Why child its distinctive
Miss Sweeney still standing smiled a pleased but rather preoccupied smile
Her eyes roved toward the door
Emma McChesney radiating good will and energy went on Wait till you see our new samples
Youll buy a million dollars worth
Just let me lead you to our new WalkEasy bifurcated skirt
We call it the onesteppers delight
 She put a hand on Ella Sweeneys arm preparatory to guiding her to the showrooms in the rear
But Miss Sweeneys strange reluctance grew into resolve
A blush as real as it was unaccustomed arose to her bepowdered cheeks
IsIthat isMr Buck is in I suppose
Mr Buck
Oh yes hes in
Miss Sweeneys eyes sought the closed door across the hall
Is thathis office
Emma McChesney stiffened a little
Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully
You have guessed it she said crisply
Mr Bucks name is on the door and you are looking at it
Miss Sweeney looked down looked up twiddled the chain about her neck
You want to see Mr
Buck
asked Emma McChesney quietly
Miss Sweeney simpered down at her glovetips fluttered her eyelids
WellyesIIyou see I bought of him this year and when you buy of a person why naturally you Naturally I understand
She walked across the hall threw open the door and met T A Bucks glance coolly
Mr Buck Miss Sweeney of Des Moines is here and Im sure you want to see her
This way Miss Sweeney
Miss Sweeney sidling blushing fluttering teetered in
Emma McChesney just before she closed the door saw a little spasm cross Bucks face
It was gone so quickly and a radiant smile sat there so reassuringly that she wondered if she had not been mistaken after all
He had advanced hand outstretched with Miss Sweeney
Itits wonderful to see you again
Youre looking The closed door stifled the rest
Emma McChesney in her office across the way stood a moment in the center of the room her hand covering her eyes
The hardy chrysanthemums still glowed sunnily from their vase
The little room was very quiet except for the ticking of the smart leatherencased clock on the desk
The closed door shut out factory and office sounds
And Emma McChesney stood with one hand over her eyes
So Napoleon might have stood after Waterloo
After this first lesson Mrs McChesney did not err again
When two days later Miss Sharp of Berg Brothers Omaha breezed in looking strangely juvenile and distinctly anticipatory Emma greeted her smilingly and waved her toward the door opposite
Miss Sharp the erstwhile bristling was strangely smooth and sleek
She glanced ever so softly sighed ever so flutteringly
Working side by side with him seeing him day after day how have you been able to resist him
Emma McChesney was only human after all
By remembering that this is a business house not a matrimonial parlor
The dart found no lodging place in Miss Sharps sleek armor
She seemed scarcely to have heard
My dear she whispered his eyes
And his manner
You must bewhatchamaycallit adamant
Is that the way you pronounce it
You know what I mean
Oh yes replied Emma McChesney evenly Iknow what you mean
She told herself that she was justified in the righteous contempt which she felt for this sort of thing
A heartbreaker
A cheap ladykiller
Whereupon in walked Sam Bloom of the Paris Emporium Duluth one of Mrs McChesneys stanchest admirers and a longtried business friend
The usual thing Younger than ever Mrs McChesney
Youre a wonderyes you are
Hows business
Same here
Going to have lunch with me today
Then Ill just run in and see Buck
Say wheres he been keeping himself all these years
Chip off the old block that boy
So he had the men too
It was in this frame of mind that Miss Ethel Morrissey found her on the morning that she came into New York on her semiannual buyingtrip
Ethel Morrissey plump matronlylooking quiet with her hair fast graying at the sides had nothing of the skittish Middle Western buyer about her
She might have passed for the mother of a brood of six if it were not for her eyesthe shrewd twinkling farsighted reckoning eyes of the business woman
She and Emma McChesney had been friends from the day that Ethel Morrissey had bought her first cautious bill of Featherlooms
Her love for Emma McChesney had much of the maternal in it
She felt a personal pride in Emma McChesneys work her success her clean reputation her life of selfdenial for her son Jock
When Ethel Morrissey was planned by her Maker she had not been meant to be wasted on the skirtandsuit department of a smalltown store
That broad gracious breast had been planned as a restingplace for heads in need of comfort
Those plump firm arms were meant to enfold the weak and distressed
Those capable hands should have smoothed troubled heads and patted plump cheeks instead of wasting their gifts in folding piles of petticoats and deftly twitching a plait or a tuck into place
She was playing Rosalind in buskins when she should have been cast for the Nurse
She entered Emma McChesneys office now in her quiet blue suit and her neat hat and she looked very sane and cheerful and rosycheeked and dependable
At least so Emma McChesney thought as she kissed her while the plump arms held her close
Ethel Morrissey the hugging process completed held her off and eyed her
Well Emma McChesney flourish your Featherlooms for me
I want to buy and get it over so we can talk
Are you sure that you want to buy of me
asked Emma McChesney a little wearily
Whats the joke
Im not joking
I thought that perhaps you might prefer to see Mr Buck this trip
Ethel Morrissey placed one forefinger under Emma McChesneys chin and turned that ladys face toward her and gazed at her long and thoughtfullythe most trying test of courage in the world that to one whose eyes fear meeting yours
Emma McChesney bravest of women tried to withstand it and failed
The next instant her head lay on Ethel Morrisseys broad breast her hands were clutching the plump shoulders her cheek was being patted soothingly by the kind hands
Now nowwhat is it dear
Tell Ethel
Yes I do know but tell me anyway
Itll do you good
And Emma McChesney told her
When she had finished You bathe your eyes Emma and put on your hat and well eat
Oh yes you will
A cup of tea anyway
Isnt there some little cool fool place where I can be comfortable on a hot day like thiswhere we can talk comfortably
Ive got at least an hours conversation in me
With the first sip of her first cup of tea Ethel Morrissey began to unload that burden of conversation
Emma this is the best thing that could have happened to you
Oh yes it is
The queer thing about it is that it didnt happen sooner
It was bound to come
You know Emma the Lord lets a woman climb just so high up the mountain of success
And then when she gets too cocky when she begins to measure her wits and brain and strength against that of men and finds herself superior he just taps her smartly on the head and shins so that she stumbles falls and rolls down a few miles on the road she has traveled so painfully
He does it just as a gentle reminder to her that shes only a woman after all
Oh I know all about this feminist talk
But this things been proven
Look at what happened toto Joan of Arc and Becky Sharp and Mary Queen of Scots andyes I have been spending my evenings reading
Now stop laughing at your old Ethel Emma McChesney
You meant me to laugh dear old thing
I dont feel much like it though
I dont see why I should be reminded of my lowly state
Heaven knows I havent been so terrifically pleased with myself
Of course that South American trip waswell gratifying
But I earned it
For ten years I lived with head in a sampletrunk didnt I
I worked hard enough to win the love of all these Westerners
It wasnt all walking dreamily down Main Street strewing Featherlooms along my path
Ethel Morrissey stirred her second cup of tea sipped stirred smiled then reached over and patted Emma McChesneys hand
Emma Im a wise old party and I can see that it isnt all pique with you
Its something elsesomething deeper
Oh yes it is
Now let me tell you what happened when T A Buck invaded your oldtime territory
I was busy up in my department the morning he came in
I had my head in a rack of coats and a henny customer waiting
But I sensed something stirring and I stuck my head out of the coatrack in which I was fumbling
The department was aflutter like a poultryyard
Every woman in it from the little new Swede stockgirl to Gladys Hemingway who is only working to wear out her old clothes was standing with her face toward the elevator and on her face a look that would make the ordinary doormat marked Welcome seem like an insult
I kind of smoothed my back hair because I knew that only one thing could bring that look into a womans face
And down the aisle came a tall slim distinguishedlooking wonderfully tailored chamoisgloved walkingsticked Fifth Avenue person with EYES
Of course I knew
But the other girls didnt
They just sort of fell back at his approach smitten
He didnt even raise an eyebrow to do it
Now Emma Im not exaggerating
I know what effect he had on me and my girls and for that matter every other man or woman in the store
Why he was a dream realized to most of em
These shrewd clever buyergirls know plenty of menbusiness men of the slapbang hornblowing bluff goodnatured hellokid kindthe kind that takes you out to dinner and blows cigar smoke in your face
Along comes this chap elegant well dressed and not even conscious of it polished suave smooth lowvoiced well bred
Why when he spoke to a girl it was the subtlest kind of flattery
Can you see little Sadie Harris of Duluth drawing a mental comparison between Sam Bloom the storemanager and this fascinating devilSam redfaced loud voiced shirtsleeving it around the sample room his hat pushed way back on his head chewing his cigar like mad and wildeyed for fear hes buying wrong
Why child in our town nobody carries a cane except the Elks when they have their annual parade and old man Schwenkel whos lame
And yet we all accepted that yellow walkingstick of Bucks
It belonged to him
There isnt a skirtbuyer in the Middle West that doesnt dream of him all night and push Featherlooms in the store all day
Emma Im old and fat and fifty but when I had dinner with him at the Manitoba House that evening I caught myself making eyes at him knowing that every woman in the diningroom would have given her front teeth to be where I was
After which extensive period Ethel Morrissey helped herself to her third cup of tea
Emma McChesney relaxed a little and laughed a tremulous little laugh
Oh well I suppose I must not hope to combat such formidable rivals as walkingsticks chamois gloves and EYES
My business arguments are futile compared to those
Ethel Morrissey delivered herself of a last shot
Youre wrong Emma
Those things helped him but they didnt sell his line
He sold Featherlooms out of salesmanship and because he sounded convincing and sincere and businesslikeand he had the samples
It wasnt all bunk
It was threequarters business
Those two make an invincible combination
An hour later Ethel Morrissey was shrewdly selecting her winter line of Featherlooms from the stock in the showrooms of the T A Buck Company
They went about their business transaction these two with the cool abruptness of men speaking little and then only of prices discounts dating shipping
Their luncheon conversation of an hour before seemed an impossibility
Youll have dinner with me tonight
Emma asked
Up at my apartment all cozy
Not tonight dearie
Ill be in bed by eight
Im not the girl I used to be
Time was when a New York buyingtrip was a vacation
Now its a chore
She took Emma McChesneys hand and patted it
If youve got something real nice for dinner though and feel like company why dont you asksomebody else thats lonesome
After which Ethel Morrissey laughed her wickedest and waved a sudden goodby with a last word about seeing her tomorrow
Emma McChesney her color high entered her office
It was five oclock
She cleared her desk in half an hour breathed a sigh of weariness reached for hat and jacket donned them and turning out her lights closed her door behind her for the day
At that same instant T A Buck slammed his own door and walked briskly down the hall
They met at the elevator
They descended in silence
The street gained they paused uncertainly
Wont you stay down and have dinner with me tonight Emma
Thanks so much T A
Not tonight
Imsorry
Good night
Good night
She turned away
He stood there in the busy street looking irresolutely and not at all eagerly in the direction of his club perhaps or his hotel or whatever shelter he sought after business hours
Something in his attitudethe loneliness of it the uncertainty the indecision smote Emma McChesney with a great pang
She came swiftly back
I wish youd come home to dinner with me
I dont know what Anniell give us
Probably bread pudding
She does when shes left to her own devices
But II wish you would
She looked up at him almost shyly
T A Buck took Emma McChesneys arm in a rather unnecessarily firm grip and propelled her surprised and protesting in the direction of the nearest vacant taxi
But T A
This is idiotic
Why take a cab to go home from the office on aa week day
In with you
Besides I never have a chance to take one from the office on Sunday do I
Does Annie always cook enough for two
Apparently Annie did
Annie was something of a witch in her way
She whisked about wrought certain changes did things with asparagus and mayonnaise lighted the roseshaded tablecandles
No one noticed that dinner was twenty minutes late
Together they admired the great mahogany buffet that Emma had miraculously found space for in the little diningroom
It glows like a great deep ruby doesnt it
she said proudly
You should see Annie circle around it with the carpetsweeper
She knows one bump would be followed by instant death
Looking back on it afterward they remembered that the dinner was a very silent one
They did not notice their wordlessness at the time
Once when the chops came on Buck said absently Oh I had those for l Then he stopped abruptly
Emma McChesney smiled
Your mother trained you well she said
The October night had grown cool
Annie had lighted a wood fire in the livingroom
That was what attracted me to this apartment in the first place Mrs McChesney said as they left the diningroom
A fireplacea practical real woodburning fireplace in a New York apartment
Id have signed the lease if the plaster had been falling in chunks and the bathtub had been zinc
Thats because fireplaces mean homein our minds said Buck
He sat looking into the heart of the glow
There fell another of those comfortable silences
T A II want to tell you that I know Ive been acting the cat ever since I got home from South America and found that you had taken charge
You see you had spoiled me
The thing that has happened to me is the thing that always happens to those who assume to be dictators
I just want you to know now that Im glad and proud and happy because you have come into your own
It hurt me just at first
That was the pride of me
Im quite over that now
Youre not only president of the T A Buck Company in name
Youre its actual head
And thats as it should be
Long live the King
Buck sat silent a moment
Then I had to do it Emma
She looked up
You have a wonderful brain said Buck then and the two utterances seemed connected in his mind
They seemed to bring no great satisfaction to the woman to whom he addressed them however
She thanked him dryly as women do when their brain is dragged into an intimate conversation
But said Buck and suddenly stood up looking at her very intently it isnt for your mind that I love you this minute
I love you for your eyes Emma and for your mouthyou have the tenderest most womanlysweet mouth in the worldand for your hair and the way your chin curves
I love you for your throatline and for the way you walk and talk and sit for the way you look at me and for the way you dont look at me
He reached down and gathered Emma McChesney the alert the aggressive the capable into his arms quite as men gather the clingingest kind of woman
And now suppose you tell me just why and how you love me
And Emma McChesney told him
When at last he was leaving Dont you think asked Emma McChesney her hands on his shoulders that you overdid the fascination thing just the least leetle bit there on the road
Well but you told me to entertain them didnt you
Yes reluctantly but I didnt tell you to consecrate your life to em
The ordinary fat middleaged everyday traveling man will never be able to sell Featherlooms in the Middle West again
They wont have em
Theyll never be satisfied with anything less than John Drew after this
Emma McChesney youre not marrying me because a lot of overdressed giggling skittish old girls have taken a fancy to make eyes at me are you
Emma McChesney stood up very straight and tall
Im marrying you T A because you are a great big fine upstanding tender wonderful Oh well then thats all right broke in Buck a little tremulously
Emma McChesneys face grew serious
But promise me one thing T A
Promise me that when you come home for dinner at night youll never say Good heavens I had that for lunch
 III A CLOSER CORPORATION Front offices resemble back kitchens in this they have always an ear at the keyhole an eye at the crack a nose in the air
But between the ordinary front office and the front office of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company there was a difference
The employees at Bucksfrom Emil the errand boy to old Pop Henderson who had started as errand boy himself twentyfive years beforepossessed the quality of loyalty
They were loyal to the memory of old man Buck because they had loved and respected him
They were loyal to Mrs Emma McChesney because she was Mrs Emma McChesney which amounts to the same reason
They were loyal to T A Buck because he was his fathers son
For three weeks the front office had been bewildered
From bewilderment it passed to worry
A worried bewildered front office is not an efficient front office
Ever since Mrs McChesney had come off the road at the death of old T A Buck to assume the secretaryship of the company which she had served faithfully for ten years she had set an example for the entire establishment
She was the pacemaker
Every day of her life she figuratively pressed the electric button that set the wheels to whirring
At nine AM sharp she appeared erect brisk alert vibrating energy
Usually the office staff had not yet swung into its gait
In a desultory way it had been getting into its sateen sleevelets adjusting its eyeshades uncovering its typewriter opening its ledgers bringing out its files
Then down the hall would come the sound of a firm light buoyant step
An electric thrill would pass through the front office
Then the sunny sincere Good morning
 Morning Mrs
McChesney
the front office would chorus back
The day had begun for the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company
Hortense the blond stenographer engaged to the shippingclerk noticed it first
The psychology of that is interesting
Hortense knew that by ninethirty Mrs McChesneys desk would be clear and that the buzzer would summon her
Hortense didnt mind taking dictation from T A Buck though his method was hesitating and jerky and he was likely to employ quite casually a baffling and unaccustomed word over which Hortenses scampering pencil would pause struggle desperately then race on
Hortense often was in for a quick furtive session with her pocketdictionary after one of T
A
s periods
But with Mrs McChesney dictation was a joy
She knew what she wanted to say and she always said it
The words she used were short cleancut meaningful AngloSaxon words
She never used received when she could use got
Hers was the rapidfiregun method each word sharp well timed efficient
Imagine then Hortense staring wideeyed and puzzled at a floundering hesitating absentminded Mrs McChesneya Mrs McChesney strangely starry as to eyes strangely dreamy as to mood decidedly deficient as to dictation
Imagine a Hortense with pencil poised in air a full five minutes waiting until Mrs McChesney should come to herself with a start frown smile vaguely pass a hand over her eyes and say Let me seewhere was I
 And we find on referring to your order that the goods you mention  Hortense would prompt patiently
Oh yes of course with an effort
Hortense was beginning to grow alarmed
In T A Bucks office just across the hall the change was quite as noticeable but in another way
His leisurely drawl was gone
His deliberate manner was replaced by a brisk quickthinking quickspeaking one
His words were brief and to the point
He seemed to be riding on the crest of an excitementwave
And as he dictated he smiled
Hortense stood it for a week
Then she unburdened herself to Miss Kelly the assistant bookkeeper
Miss Kelly evinced no surprise at her disclosures
I was just talking about it to Pop yesterday
She acts worried doesnt she
And yet not exactly worried either
Do you suppose it can be that son of herswhats his name
Jock
Hortense shook her head
No hes all right
She had a letter from him yesterday
Hes got a grand position in Chicago and hes going to marry that girl he was so stuck on here
And it isnt that either because Mrs McChesney likes her
I can tell by the way she talks about her
I ought to know
Look how Henrys ma acted toward me when we were first engaged
The front office buzzed with it
It crept into the workroominto the shippingroom
It penetrated the frowsy head of Jake the elevatorman
As the days went on and the tempo of the front office slackened with that of the two bright little inner offices only one member of the whole staff remained unmoved incurious taciturn
Pop Henderson listened one scant old eyebrow raised knowingly a whimsical halfsmile screwing up his wrinkled face
At the end of three weeks Hortense with that display of temperament so often encountered in young ladies of her profession announced in desperation that if this thing kept on she was going to forget herself and jeopardize her position by demanding to know outright what the trouble was
From the direction of Pop Hendersons inky retreat there came the sound of a dry chuckle
Pop Henderson had been chuckling in just that way for three weeks now
It was getting on the nerves of his colleagues
If you ever spring the joke thats kept you giggling for a month snapped Hortense itll break up the office
Pop Henderson removed his eyeshade very deliberately passed his thin cramped old hand over his scant gray locks to his bald spot climbed down stiffly from his stool ambled to the center of the room and head cocked like a knowing old brown sparrow regarded the pert Hortense over his spectacles and under his spectacles and finally through his spectacles
Young folks now days began Pop Henderson dryly are so darned cute and knowin that when an old fellow cuts in ahead of em for once he likes to hug the joke to himself a while before he springs it
There was no acid in his tone
He was beaming very benignantly down upon the little blond stenographer
You say that Mrs Mack is absentmindedlike and dreamy and that young T A acts like hed swallowed an electric battery
Well when it comes to that Ive seen you many a time when you didnt know any one was lookin just sitting there at your typewriter with your hands kind of poised halfway and your lips sort of parted and your eyes just gazing away somewhere off in the distance for fifteen minutes at a stretch
And out there in the shippingroom Henrys singing like a whole minstrel troupe all day long when he isnt whistlin so loud you can hear him over s far as Eighth Avenue
Then as the red surged up through the girls fair skin Well
drawled old Pop Henderson and the dry chuckle threatened again
Weeell
Why Pop Henderson
exploded Miss Kelly from her cage
WhyPopHenderson
In those six words the brisk and agileminded Miss Kelly expressed the surprise and the awed conviction of the office staff
Pop Henderson trotted over to the watercooler drew a brimming glass drank it off and gave vent to a great exhaust of breath
He tried not to strut as he crossed back to his desk climbed his stool adjusted his eyeshade and with a last throaty chuckle plunged into his books again
But his words already were working their wonders
The office after the first shock was flooded with a new atmospherea subtle pervasive air of hushed happiness of tender solicitude
It went about like a mother who has found her child asleep at play and who steals away atiptoe finger on lip lips smiling tenderly
The delicate antennae of Emma McChesneys mind sensed the change
Perhaps she read something in the glowing eyes of her sisterin love Hortense
Perhaps she caught a new tone in Miss Kellys voice or the forewomans
Perhaps a whisper from the outer office reached her desk
The very afternoon of Pop Hendersons electrifying speech Mrs McChesney crossed to T A Bucks office shut the door after her lowered her voice discreetly and said T A theyre on
What makes you think so
Nothing
That is nothing definite
No manreason
Just a womanreason
T A Buck strolled over to her smiling
I havent known you all this time without having learned that thats reason enough
And if they really do know Im glad
But we didnt want them to know
Not yetuntiluntil just before the T A Buck laid his hands lightly on Emma McChesneys shoulders
Emma McChesney promptly reached up and removed them
There you are
exclaimed Buck and rammed the offending hands into his pockets
Thats why Im glad they knowif they really do know
Im no actor
Im a skirtandlingerie manufacturer
For the last six weeks instead of being allowed to look at you with the expression that a man naturally wears when hes looking at the woman hes going to marry what have I had to do
Glare thats what
Scowl
Act like a captain of finance when Ive felt like a Romeo
Ive had to be dry terse businesslike when I was bursting with adjectives that had nothing to do with business
Youve avoided my office as you would a smallpox camp
Youve greeted me with a whatcanIdoforyou air when Ive dared to invade yours
You couldnt have been less cordial to a book agent
If it werent for those two hours you grant me in the evening IdId blow up with a loud report thats what
Id Now now T
A
interrupted Emma McChesney soothingly and patted one gesticulating arm
It has been a bit of a strainfor both of us
But you know we agreed it would be best this way
Weve ten days more to go
Lets stick it out as weve begun
It has been best for us for the office for the business
The next time you find yourself choked up with a stock of fancy adjectives write a sonnet to me
Work em off that way
T A Buck stood silent a moment regarding her with a concentration that would have unnerved a woman less poised
Emma McChesney when you talk like that so coolly so evenly soso darned mentally I sometimes wonder if you really Dont say it T A
Because you dont mean it
Ive had to fight for most of my happiness
Ive never before found it ready at hand
Ive always had to dig for it with a shovel and a spade and a pickax and then blast
I had almost twenty years of that from the time I was eighteen until I was thirtyeight
It taught me to take my happiness seriously and my troubles lightly
She shut her eyes for a moment and her voice was very low and very deep and very vibrant
So when Im coolest and evenest and most mental T A you may know that Ive struck gold
A great glow illumined Bucks fine eyes
He took two quick steps in her direction
But Emma McChesney one hand on the doorknob warned him off with the other
Heywait a minute
pleaded Buck
Cant
Ive a fitting at the tailors at threethirtymy new suit
Wait till you see it
The dickens you have
But so have I he jerked out his watchat threethirty
Its the suit Im going to wear when I travel as a blushing bridegroom
Sos mine
And look here T A
We cant both leave this place for a fitting
Its absurd
If this keeps on it will break up the business
Well have to get married one at a timeor at least get our trousseaux one at a time
Whats your suit
Sort of brown
Brown
Sos mine
Good heavens T A well look like a minstrel troupe
Buck sighed resignedly
If I telephone my tailor that I cant make it until fourthirty will you promise to be back by that time
Yes but remember if your bride appears in a skirt that sags in the back or a coat that bunches across the shoulders the crime will lie at your door
So it was that the lynxeyed office staff began to wonder if after all Pop Henderson was the wizard that he had claimed to be
During working hours Mrs McChesney held rigidly to business
Her handsome partner tried bravely to follow her example
If he failed occasionally perhaps Emma McChesney was not so displeased as she pretended to be
A business discussion deeply interesting to both was likely to run thus Buck entering her office briskly papers in hand Mrs
McChesneyahemI have here a letter from Singer  French Columbus Ohio
They ask for an extension
Theyve had ninety days
Thats enough
That firms slow pay and always will be until old Singer has the good taste and common sense to retire
It isnt because the stock doesnt move
Singer simply believes in not paying for anything until he has to
If I were you Id write him that this is a business house not a charitable institution No dont do that
It isnt politic
But you know what I mean
Hm yes
A silence
Emma thats a fiendishly becoming gown
Now T
A
But it is
Itits so kind of loose and yet clinging and those white collarandcuff things T A Buck Ive worn this thing down to the office every day for a month
It shines in the back
Besides you promised not to Oh darn it all Emma Im human you know
How do you suppose I can stand here and look at you and not Emma McChesney pressing the buzzer that summons Hortense You know Tim I dont exactly hate you this morning either
But business is business
Stop looking at me like that
Then to Hortense in the doorway Just take this letter Miss StotzSinger  French Columbus Ohio
Dear Sirs Yours of the tenth at hand
Period
Regarding your request for further extension we wish to say that in view of the fact T A Buck half resentful half amused wholly admiring would disappear
But Hortense eyes demurely cast down at her notebook was not deceived
Say she confided to Miss Kelly they think theyve got me fooled
But Im wise
Dont I know
When Henry passes through the office here from the shippingroom he looks at me just as cool and indifferent
Before we announced it we had you all guessing didnt we
But I can see something back of that look that the rest of you cant get
Well when Mr Buck looks at her I can see the same thing in his eyes
Say when it comes to seeing the lovelight through the fog Im there with the spyglass
If Emma McChesney held herself well in leash during the busy day she relished her happiness none the less when she could allow herself the full savor of it
When a girl of eighteen she had married a man of the sort that must put whisky into his stomach before the machinery of his day would take up its creaking round
Out of the degradation of that marriage she had emerged triumphantly sweet and unsullied and she had succeeded in bringing her son Jock McChesney out into the clear sunlight with her
The evenings spent with T A Buck the man of fine instincts of breeding of proven worth of rare tenderness filled her with a great peace and happiness
When doubts assailed her it was not for herself but for him
Sometimes the fear would clutch her as they sat before the fire in the sittingroom of her comfortable little apartment
She would voice those fears for the very joy of having them stilled
T A this is too much happiness
ImIm afraid
After all youre a young man though you are a bit older than I in actual years
But men of your age marry girls of eighteen
Youre handsome
And youve brains family breeding money
Any girl in New York would be glad to marry youthose tall slim exquisite young girls
Young
And well bred and poised and fresh and sweet and lovable
You see them every day on Fifth Avenue exquisitely dressed entirely desirable
They make me feeloldold and battered
Ive sold goods on the road
Ive fought and worked and struggled
And it has left its mark
I did it for the boy God bless him
And Im glad I did it
But it put me out of the class of that girl you see on Yes Emma youre not at all in the class with that girl you see every day on Fifth Avenue
Fifth Avenues full of herhundreds of her thousands of her
Perhaps five years ago before I had worked side by side with you I might have been attracted by that girl you see every day on Fifth Avenue
You dont see a procession of Emma McChesneys every day on Fifth Avenuenot by a long shot
Why
Because theres only one of her
She doesnt come in dozen lots
I know that that girl you see every day on Fifth Avenue is all that I deserve
But by some heavensent miracle Im to have this Emma McChesney woman
I dont know how it came to be true
I dont deserve it
But it is true and thats enough for me
Emma McChesney would look up at him eyes wet mouth smiling
T A youre balm and myrrh and incense and meat and drink to me
I wish I had words to tell you what Im thinking now
But I havent
So Ill just cover it up
We both know its there
And Ill tell you that you make love like a movie hero
Yes you do
Better than a movie hero because in the films the heroine always has to turn to face the camera which makes it necessary for him to make love down the back of her neck
But T A Buck was unsmiling
Dont trifle Emma
And dont think you can fool me that way
I havent finished
I want to settle this Fifth Avenue creature for all time
What I have to say is this I think you are more attractivefiner bigger more rounded in character and manner mellower sweeter sounder with all your angles and corners rubbed smooth saner better poised than any woman I have ever known
And what I am today you have made me directly and indirectly by association and by actual orders by suggestion and by direct contact
What you did for Jock purposefully and by force you did for me too
Not so directly perhaps but with the same result
Emma McChesney youve madeactually made molded shaped and turned out two men
Youre the greatest sculptor that ever lived
You could make a scarecrow in a field get up and achieve
Everywhere one sees women overwrought overstimulated eager tense
When there appears one who has herself in leash balanced tolerant poised sane composed she restores your faith in things
You lean on her spiritually
I know I need you more than you need me Emma
And I know you wont love me the less for that
Therethats about all for this evening
I think breathed Emma McChesney in a choked little voice that thats aboutenough
Two days before the date set for their very quiet wedding they told the heads of office and workroom
Office and workroom somewhat moist as to eye and flushed as to cheek and highly congratulatory proved their knowingness by promptly presenting to their employers a very costly and unbelievably hideous set of mantel ornaments and clock calculated to strike horror to the heart of any woman who has lovingly planned the furnishing of her drawingroom
Pop Henderson after some preliminary wrestling with collar necktie spectacles and voice launched forth on a presentation speech that threatened to close down the works for the day
Emma McChesney heard it tears in her eyes
T A Buck gnawed his mustache
And when Pop Hendersons cracked old voice broke altogether in the passage that touched on his departed employer old T A Buck and the great happiness that this occasion would have brought him Emmas hand met young T
A
s and rested there
Hortense and Henry standing very close together all through the speech had in this respect anticipated their employers by several minutes
They were to be away two weeks only
No one knew just where except that some small part of the trip was to be spent on a flying visit to young Jock McChesney out in Chicago
He himself was to be married very soon
Emma McChesney had rather startled her very good looking husbandtobe by whirling about at him with T A do you realize that youre very likely to be a stepgrandfather some fine day not so far away
T A had gazed at her for a rather shocked moment swallowed hard smiled and said Even that doesnt scare me Emma
Everything had been planned down to the last detail
Mrs McChesneys little apartment had been subleased and a very smart one taken and furnished almost complete with Annie installed in the kitchen and a demure parlormaid engaged
When we come back well come home T A Buck had said
Home
There had been much to do but it had all been done smoothly and expertly under the direction of these two who had learned how to plan direct and carry out
Then on the last day Emma McChesney visibly perturbed entered her partners office a letter in her hand
This is ghastly
she exclaimed
Buck pulled out a chair for her
Klein cancel his order again
No
And dont ask me to sit down
Be thankful that I dont blow up
Is it as bad as that
Bad
Hereread that
No dont read it Ill tell you
Itll relieve my feelings
You know how Ive been angling and scheming and contriving and plotting for years to get an exclusive order from Gage  Fosdick
Of course weve had a nice little order every few months but whats that from the biggest mailorder house in the world
And now out of a blue sky comes this bolt from OMalley who buys our stuff saying that hes coming on the tenththats next weekthat hes planned to establish our line with their trade and that he wants us to be prepared for a recordbreaking order
Ive fairly prayed for this
And nowwhat shall we do
Do
smoothlyjust write the gentleman and tell him youre busy getting married this week and next and that by a singular coincidence your partner is similarly engaged that our manager will attend to him with all care and courtesy unless he can postpone his trip until our return
Suggest that he call around a week or two later
T A Buck I know it isnt considered good form to rage and glare at ones fiance on the eve of ones weddingday
If this were a week earlier or a week later Id be tempted toshake you
Buck stood up came over to her and laid a hand very gently on her arm
With the other hand he took the letter from her fingers
Emma youre tired and a little excited
Youve been under an unusual physical and mental strain for the last few weeks
Give me that letter
Ill answer it
This kind of thinghe held up the letterhas meant everything to you
If it had not where would I be today
But tonight Emma it doesnt mean a thing
Notone thing
Slowly Emma McChesneys tense body relaxed
A great sigh that had in it weariness and relief and acquiescence came from her
She smiled ever so faintly
Ive been a ramrod so long its going to be hard to learn to be a clinging vine
Ive been my own support for so many years I dont use a trellis very gracefullyyet
But I think Ill get the hang of it very soon
She turned toward the door crossed to her own office looked all about at the orderly ship shape room that reflected her personalityas did any room she occupied
Just the same she called out over her shoulder to Buck in the doorway I hate like fury to see that order slide
In hat and coat and furs she stood a moment her fingers on the electric switch her eyes very bright and wide
The memories of ten years fifteen years twenty years crowded up around her and filled the little room
Some of them were golden and some of them were black a few had power to frighten her even now
So she turned out the light stood for just another moment there in the darkness then stepped out into the hall closed the door softly behind her and stood face to face with the lettering on the glass panel of the doorthe lettering that spelled the name MRS
MCCHESNEY
T A Buck watched her in silence
She reached up with one wavering forefinger and touched each of the twelve letters one after the other
Then she spread her hand wide blotting out the second word
And when she turned away one sawshe being Emma McChesney and a woman and very tired and rather sentimental and a bit hysterical and altogether happythat though she was smiling her eyes were wet
In her ten years on the road visiting town after town catching trains jolting about in rumbling hotel buses or mustysmelling small town hacks living in hotels good bad and indifferent Emma McChesney had come upon hundreds of ricestrewn ribbonbedecked bridal couples
She had leaned from her window at many a railway station to see the barbaric and cruel old custom of brideandbridegroom baiting
She had smiled very tenderlyand rather sadly and hopefully tooupon the boy and girl who rushed breathless into the car in a flurry of white streamers flowers old shoes laughter cheers last messages
Now as in a dream she found herself actually of these
Of rice old shoes and badinage there had been none it is true
She stood quietly by while Buck attended to their trunks just as she had seen it done by hundreds of helpless little cottonwool women who had never checked a trunk in their livesshe who had spent ten years of her life wrestling with trunks and baggagemen and porters
Once there was some trifling mistakeBucks fault
Emma with her experience of the road saw his error
She could have set him right with a word
It was on the tip of her tongue
By sheer force of will she withheld that word fought back the almost overwhelming inclination to take things in hand set them right
It was just an incident almost trifling in itself
But its import was tremendous for her conduct that moment shaped the happiness of their future life together
Emma had said that there would be no rude awakenings for them no startling shocks
There isnt a thing we dont know about each other she had said
We each know the others weaknesses and strength
I hate the way you gnaw your mustache when youre troubled and I think the fuss you make when the waiter pours your coffee without first having given you sugar and cream is the most absurd thing Ive ever seen
But then I know how it annoys you to see me sitting with one slipper dangling from my toe when Im particularly comfortable and snug
You know how I like my eggs and you think its immoral
I suppose were really set in our ways
Its going to be interesting to watch each other shift
Just the same Buck said I didnt dream there was any woman living who could actually make a Pullman drawingroom look homelike
Any woman who has spent a fourth of her life in hotels and trains learns that trick
She has to
If she happens to be the sort that likes books and flowers and sewing she carries some of each with her
And one book one rose and one piece of unfinished embroidery would make an oasis in the Sahara Desert look homelike
It was on the westbound train that they encountered SamSam of the rolling eye the genial grin the deft hand
Sam was known to every hardened traveler as the porter de luxe of the road
Sam was a diplomat a financier and a rascal
He never forgot a face
He never forgave a meager tip
The passengers who traveled with him were at once his guests and his victims
Therefore his Good evenin Mis McChesney maam
Good even
Well it suhtnly has been a long time sense Ah had the pleasuh of yoh presence as passengah maam
Ah sure am The slim elegant figure of T A Buck appeared in the doorway
Sams rolling eye became a thing on ball bearings
His teeth flashed startlingly white in the broadest of grins
He took Bucks hat ran a finger under its inner band and shook it very gently
Whats the idea
inquired Buck genially
Are you a combination porter and prestidigitator
Sam chuckled his infectious negro chuckle
Well no sah
Ah wouldn gos fah as t say that sah
But Ah hab been known to shake rice out of a genlmans ordinary everday black derby hat
Get out
laughed T A Buck as Sam ducked
You may as well get used to it smiled Emma because Im known to every trainconductor porter hotelclerk chambermaid and bellboy between here and the Great Lakes
It was Sam who proved himself hero of the honeymoon for he saved T A Buck from continuing his journey to Chicago brideless
Fifteen minutes earlier Buck had gone to the buffetcar for a smoke
At Cleveland Emma looking out of the car window saw a familiar figure pacing up and down the station platform
It was that dapper and important little Irishman OMalley buyer for Gage  Fosdick the greatest mailorder house in the worldOMalley whose letter T A Buck had answered OMalley whose order meant thousands
He was on his way to New York of course
In that moment Mrs T A Buck faded into the background and Emma McChesney rose up in her place
She snatched hat and coat and furs put them on as she went down the long aisle swung down the car steps and flew down the platform to the unconscious OMalley
He was smoking all unconscious
The Fates had delivered him into her expert hands
She knew those kindly sisters of old and she was the last to refuse their largesse
Mr
OMalley
He wheeled
Mrs
McChesney
He had just a charming trace of a brogue
His enemies said he assumed it
Well who was I thinkin of but you a minute ago
What Im on my way to Chicago
Saw you from the car window
Youre on the New York train
I thought so
Tell me youre surely seeing our man arent you
OMalleys smiling face clouded
He was a temperamental IrishmanTed OMalley with ideas on the deference due him and his great house
Ill tell you the truth Mrs McChesney
I had a letter from your Mr Buck
It wasnt much of a letter to a man like me representing a house like Gage  Fosdick
It said both heads of the firm would be out of town and would I see the manager
Mesee the manager
Well thinks I if thats how important they think my order then theyll not get itthats all
Ive never yet Dear Mr OMalley please dont be offended
As a McChesney to an OMalley I want to tell you that Ive just been married
Married
God bless meto To T A Buck of course
Hes on that train
He She turned toward the train
And as she turned it began to move ever so gently
At the same moment there sped toward her with unbelievable swiftness the figure of Sam the porter his eyes all whites
By one arm he grasped her and half carried half jerked her to the steps of the moving train swung her up to the steps like a bundle of rags caught the rail by a miracle and stood grinning and triumphant gazing down at the panting OMalley who was running alongside the train
Back in a week
Will you wait for us in New York
called Emma her breath coming fast
She was trembling too and laughing
Will I wait
called back the puffing OMalley every bit of the Irish in him beaming from his eyes
Ill be there when you get back as sure as your names McBuck
From his pocket he took a round silver Western dollar and still running tossed it to the toothy Sam
That peerless porter caught it twirled it kissed it bowed and grinned afresh as the train glided out of the shed
Emma flushed smiling flew up the aisle
Buck listening to her laughing triumphant account of her hairbreadth harumscarum adventure frowned before he smiled
Emma how could you do it
At least why didnt you send back for me first
Emma smiled a little tremulously
Dont be angry
You see dear boy Ive only been your wife for a week
But Ive been Featherloom petticoats for over fifteen years
Its a habit
Just how strong and fixed a habit she proved to herself a little more than a week later
It was the morning of their first breakfast in the new apartment
You would have thought to see them over their coffee and eggs and rolls that they had been breakfasting together thus for yearsAnnie was so at home in her new kitchen the deft little maid in her crisp white fitted so perfectly into the picture
Perhaps the thing that T A Buck said once the maid left them alone might have given an outsider the cue
You remind me of a sweetpea Emma
One of those crisp erect goldenwhite fresh fragrant sweetpeas
I think it is the slenderest sweetest neatest trimmest flower in the world so delicately set on its stem and yet so straight so independent
T A you say such dear things to me
No they had not been breakfasting together for years
Im glad youre not one of those women that wears a frowsy lacy ribbony whatdoyou callemboudoircapdown to breakfast
They always make me think of uncombed hair
Thats just one reason why Im glad
And Im glad said Emma looking at his clear eyes and steady hand and firm skin for a number of reasons
One of them is that youre not the sort of man whos a grouch at breakfast
When he had hat and coat and stick in hand and had kissed her goodby and reached the door and opened it he came back again as is the way of bridegrooms
But at last the door closed behind him
Emma sat there a moment listening to his quick light step down the corridor to the opening of the lift door to its metallic closing
She sat there in the sunshiny diningroom in her fresh white morning gown
She picked up her newspaper opened it scanned it put it down
For years now she had read her newspaper in little gulps on the way downtown in crowded subway or streetcar
She could not accustom herself to this leisurely scanning of the pages
She rose went to the window came back to the table stood there a moment her eyes fixed on something far away
The swinging door between diningroom and butlers pantry opened
Annie in her neat blueandwhite stripes stood before her
Shall it be steak or chops tonight Mrs
McBuck

IV BLUE SERGE For ten years Mrs Emma McChesneys home had been a wardrobetrunk
She had taken her family life at second hand
Four nights out of the seven her bed was Lower Eight and her breakfast as many mornings a cinderstrewn lukewarm horror taken teteatete with a sleepyeyed stranger and presided over by a whitecoated blackfaced bandit to whom a coffeeslopped saucer was a matter of course
It had been her habit during those ten years on the road as traveling saleswoman for the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company to avoid the discomfort of the rapidly chilling car by slipping early into her berth
There in kimono if not in comfort she would shut down the electric light with a snap raise the shade and propped up on one elbow watch the little towns go by
They had a wonderful fascination for her those Middle Western towns whose very names had a comfortable home like soundSandusky Galesburg Crawfordsville Appletonvery real towns with very real people in them
Peering wistfully out through the dusk she could get little intimate glimpses of the home life of these people as the night came on
In those modest frame houses near the station they need not trouble to pull down the shades as must their cautious city cousins
As the train slowed down there could be had a glimpse of a matronly housewife moving deftly about in the kitchens warmyellow glow a man reading a paper in slippered shirtsleeved comfort a pigtailed girl at the piano a woman with a baby in her arms or a family group perhaps seated about the table deep in an aftersupper conclave
It had made her homeless as she was homesick
Emma always liked that picture best
Her keen imaginative mind could sense the scene could actually follow the trend of the talk during this the most genial homely soulcheering hour of the day
The trifling events of the last twelve hours in schoolroom in store in office in street in kitchen loom up large as they are rehearsed in that magic animated cozy moment just before ma says with a sigh Well folks go on into the sittingroom
Me and Nellieve got to clear away
Just silhouettes as the train flashed bythese smalltown peoplebut very human very enviable to Emma McChesney
Theyre real she would say
Theyre regular threemealsaday people
Ive been peeking in at their windows for ten years and Ive learned that it is in these towns that folks really live
The difference between life here and life in New York is the difference between area and depth
Dyou see what I mean
In New York they live by the mile and here they live by the cubic foot
Well Id rather have one juicy thick clubsteak than a whole platterful of quarterinch
Its the same idea
To those of her business colleagues whose habit it was to lounge in the hotel window with sneering comment upon the smalltown procession as it went by Emma McChesney had been wont to say Dont sneer at Main Street
When you come to think of it isnt it true that Fifth Avenue any bright winter afternoon between four and six is only Main Street on a busy day multiplied by one thousand
Emma McChesney was not the sort of woman to rail at a fate that had placed her in the harness instead of in the carriage
But during all the long years of uphill pull from the time she started with a humble salary in the office of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company through the years spent on the road up to the very time when the crown of success came to her in the form of the secretaryship of the prosperous firm of T A Buck there was a minor but fixed ambition in her heart
That same ambition is to be found deep down in the heart of every woman whose morning costume is a tailor suit whose newspaper must be read in hurried snatches on the way downtown in crowded train or car and to whom nine AM spells Business
In fifteen years Emma McChesney used to say Ive never known what it is to loll in leisure
Ive never had a chance to luxuriate
Sunday
To a working woman Sunday is for the purpose of repairing the ravages of the other six days
By the time youve washed your brushes mended your skirtbraid darned your stockings and gloves looked for gray hairs and crowsfeet and skimmed the magazine section its Monday
It was small wonder that Emma McChesneys leisure had been limited
In those busy years she had not only earned the living for herself and her boy she had trained that boy into manhood and placed his foot on the first rung of business success
She had transformed the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company from a placidly mediocre concern to a thriving flourishing nationally known institution
All this might have turned another womans head
It only served to set Emma McChesneys more splendidly on her shoulders
Not too splendidly however for with her marriage to her handsome business partner T A Buck that wellset independent head was found to fit very cozily into the comfortable hollow formed by T A Bucks right arm
Emma Buck had said just before their marriage what is the arrangement to be afterafter Just what it is now I suppose Emma had replied except that well come down to the office together
He had regarded her thoughtfully for a long minute
Then Emma for three months after our marriage will you try being just Mrs T A
Buck
You mean no factory no Featherlooms no dictation no business bothers
Her voice was a rising scale of surprise
Just try it for three months with the privilege of a lifetime if you like it
But try it
IId like to see you there when I leave Emma
Id like to have you there when I come home
I suppose I sound like a selfish Turk but You sound like a regular husband Emma McChesney had interrupted and I love you for it
Now listen T A
For three whole months Im going to be what the yellow novels used to call a dollwife
Im going to meet you at the door every night with a rose in my hair
I shall wear pink things with lace ruffles on em
Dont you know that Ive been longing to do just those things for years and years
Im going to blossom out into a beauty
Watch me
Ive never had time to study myself
Ill hold shades of yellow and green and fleshcolor up to my face to see which brings out the right tints
Im going to gaze at myself through halfclosed eyes to see which shade produces tawny lights in my hair
Ever since I can remember Ive been so busy that it has been a question of getting the best possible garments in the least possible time for the smallest possible sum
In that case one gets blue serge
Ive worn blue serge until it feels like a convicts uniform
Im going to blossom out into fawn and green and mauve
I shall get evening dresses with only bead shoulderstraps
Im going to shop
Ive never really seen Fifth Avenue between eleven and one when the real people come out
My views of it have been at nine AM when the officeworkers are going to work and at five thirty when they are going home
I will now cease to observe the proletariat and mingle with the predatory
Ill probably go in for those tiffin things at the Plaza
If I do Ill never be the same woman again
Whereupon she paused with dramatic effect
To all of which T A Buck had replied Go as far as you like
Take fencing lessons if you want to or Sanskrit
Youve been a queen bee for so many years that I think the role of drone will be a pleasant change
Let me shoulder the business worries for a while
Youve borne them long enough
Its a bargain
For three months I shall do nothing more militant than to pick imaginary threads off your coat lapel and pout when you mention business
At the end of those three months well go into private session compare notes and determine whether the plan shall cease or become permanent
Shake hands on it
They shook hands solemnly
As they did so a faint shadow of doubt hovered far far back in the depths of T A Bucks fine eyes
And a faint inscrutable smile lurked in the corners of Emmas lips
So it was that Emma McChesney the alert the capable the brisk the businesslike assumed the role of Mrs T A Buck the leisurely the languid the elegant
She who formerly at eleven in the morning might have been seen bent on selling the best possible bill of spring Featherlooms to Joe Greenbaum of Keokuk Iowa could now be found in a modistes grayandraspberry salon being draped and pinned and fitted
She whose dynamic force once charged the entire office and factory with energy and efficiency now distributed a tithe of that priceless vigor here a tithe there a tithe everywhere and thus broke the very backbone of its power
She had never been a woman to do things by halves
What she undertook to do she did thoroughly and wholeheartedly
This principle she applied to her new mode of life as rigidly as she had to the old
That first month slipped magically by
Emma was too much a woman not to feel a certain exquisite pleasure in the selecting of delicate and becoming fabrics
There was a thrill of novelty in being able to spend an hour curled up with a book after lunch to listen to music one afternoon a week to drive through the mistily gray park to walk up the thronged sparkling Avenue pausing before its Aladdins Cave windows
Simple enough pleasures and taken quite as a matter of course by thousands of other women who had no workfilled life behind them to use as contrast
She plunged into her new life wholeheartedly
The first new gown was exciting
It was a velvet affair with furs and gratifyingly becoming
Her shining blond head rose above the soft background of velvet and fur with an effect to distract the least observing
Like it
she had asked Buck turning slowly frankly sure of herself
Youre wonderful in it said T A Buck
Say Emma wheres that blue thing you used to wearthe one with the white cuffs and collar and the little blue hat with the whatchamacallems on it
T A Buck youreyourewell youre a man thats what you are
That blue thing was worn threadbare in the office and I gave it to the laundresss niece weeks ago
Small wonder her cheeks took on a deeper pink
Oh said Buck unruffled too bad
There was something about that dressI dont know At the first sitting of the second gown Emma revolted openly
On the floor at Emmas feet there was knotted into a contortionistic attitude a small wiry impolite person named Smalley
Miss Smalley was an artist in draping and knew it
She was the least fashionable person in all that smart dressmaking establishment
She refused to notice the corsetcoiffureandcharmeuse edict that governed all other employees in the shop
In her shabby little dress her steelrimmed spectacles her blacksateen apron Smalley might have passed for a Bird Center home dressmaker
Yet given a yard or two or three of satin and a saucer of pins Smalley could make the dumpiest of debutantes look like a fragile flower
At a critical moment Emma stirred
Handicapped as she was by a mouthful of nineteen pins and her bowknot attitude Smalley still could voice a protest
Dont move
she commanded thickly
Wait a minute Emma said and moved again more disastrously than before
Dont you think its tootoo young
She eyed herself in the mirror anxiously then looked down at Miss Smalleys nutcracker face that was peering up at her its lips pursed grotesquely over the pins
Of course it is mumbled Miss Smalley
Everybodys clothes are too young for em nowadays
The only difference between the dresses we make for girls of sixteen and the dresses we make for their grandmothers of sixty is that the sixtyyearold ones want em shorter and lower and they run more to rosebud trimming
Emma surveyed the acid Miss Smalley with a look that was half amused half vexed wholly determined
I shant wear it
Heaven knows Im not sixty but Im not sixteen either
I dont want to be
Miss Smalley doubling again to her task flung upward a grudging compliment
Well anyway youve got the hair and the coloring and the figure for it
Goodness knows you look young enough
Thats because Ive worked hard all my life retorted Emma almost viciously
Another month of this leisure and Ill be as wrinkled as the rest of them
Smalleys magic fingers paused in their manipulation of a soft fold of satin
Worked
Earned a living
Used your wits and brains every day against the wits and brains of other folks
Every day
Into the eyes of Miss Smalley the artist in draping there crept the shrewd twinkle of Miss Smalley the successful woman in business
She had been sitting back on her knees surveying her handiwork through narrowed lids
Now she turned her gaze on Emma who was smiling down at her
Then for goodness sake dont stop
Ive found out that work is a kind of selfoiler
If youre used to it the minute you stop you begin to get rusty and your hinges creak and you clog up
And the next thing you know you break down
Work that you like to do is a blessing
It keeps you young
When my mother was my age she was crippled with rheumatism and all gnarled up and quavery and all she had to look forward to was death
Now meevery time the styles in skirts change I get a new hold on life
And on a day when I can make a short fat woman look like a tall thin woman just by sitting here on my knees with a handful of pins and giving her the line she needs I go home feeling like Id just been born
I know that feeling said Emma in her eyes a sparkle that had long been absent
Ive had it when Ive landed a thousanddollar Featherloom order from a man who has assured me that he isnt interested in our line
At dinner that evening Emmas gown was so obviously not of the new crop that even her husbands inexpert eye noted it
Thats not one of the new ones is it
This
And you a manufacturer of skirts
Whats the matter with the supply of new dresses
Isnt there enough to go round
Enough
Ive never had so many new gowns in my life
The trouble is that I shant feel at home in them until Ive had em all drycleaned at least once
During the second month there came a sudden sharp change in skirt modes
For four years women had been mincing along in garments so absurdly narrow that each step was a thing to be considered each curbing or carstep demanding careful negotiation
Now Fashion in her freakiest mood commanded a bewildering width of skirt that was just one remove from the flaring hoops of Civil War days
Emma knew what that meant for the Featherloom workrooms and selling staff
New designs new models a shift in prices a boom for petticoats for four years a garment despised
A hundred questions were on the tip of Emmas tongue a hundred suggestions flashed into her keen mind there occurred to her a wonderful design for a new model which should be full and flaring without being bulky and uncomfortable as were the wide petticoats of the old days
But a bargain was a bargain
Still Emma Buck was as human as Emma McChesney had been
She could not resist a timid T A are youthat isI was just wonderingyoure making em wide I suppose for the spring trade
A queer look flashed into T A Bucks eyes a relieved look that was as quickly replaced by an expression both baffled and anxious
Whyammmmyesoh yes were making em up wide but But what
Emma leaned forward tense
Oh nothingnothing
During the second month there came calling on Emma those solid and heavy New Yorkers with whom the Buck family had been on friendly terms for many years
They came at the correct hour in their correct motor or conservative broughams wearing their quietly correct clothes and Emma gave them tea and they talked on every subject from suffrage to salad dressings and from war to weather but never once was mention made of business
And Emma McChesneys life had been interwoven with business for more than fifteen years
There were dinnerslong heavy correct dinners
Emma very well dressed brighteyed alert intelligent vital became very popular at these affairs and her husband very proud of her popularity
And if any one as thoroughly alive as Mrs T A Buck could have been bored to extinction by anything then those dinners would have accomplished the deadly work
T A she said one evening after a particularly large affair of this sort T A have you ever noticed anything about me that is different from other women
Have I
Well I should say I Oh I dont mean what you mean dear thanks just the same
I mean those women tonight
They all seem to go in for something votes or charity or dancing or social service or somethingeven the girls
And they all sounded so amateurish so untrained so unprepared yet they seemed to be dreadfully in earnest
This is the difference said T A Buck
Youve rubbed up against life and you know
Theyve always been sheltered but now they want to know
Well naturally theyre going to bungle and bump their heads a good many times before they really find out
Anyway retorted Emma they want to know
Thats something
Its better to have bumped your head even though you never see whats on the other side of the wall than never to have tried to climb it
It was in the third week of the third month that Emma encountered Hortense
Hortense before her marriage to Henry the shipping clerk had been a very pretty very pert very devoted little stenographer in the office of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company
She had married just a month after her employers and Emma from the fulness of her own brimming cup of happiness had made Hortense happy with a gift of linens and lingerie and lace of a fineness that Hortenses beautyloving feminine heart could never have hoped for
They met in the busy aisle of a downtown department store and shook hands as do those who have a common bond
Hortense as pretty as ever and as pert spoke first
I wouldnt have known you Mrs Mc Buck
No
Why not
You lookno one would think youd ever worked in your life
I was down at the office the other day for a minutethe first time since I was married
They told me you werent there any more
No I havent been down since my marriage either
Im like youan elegant lady of leisure
Hortenses brightblue eyes dwelt searchingly on the face of her former employer
The bunch in the office said they missed you something awful
Then in haste Oh I dont mean that Mr Buck dont make things go all right
Theyre awful fond of him
ButI dont knowMiss Kelly said she never has got over waiting for the sound of your step down the hall at ninesort of light and quick and sharp and busy as if you couldnt wait till you waded into the days work
Do you know what I mean
I know what you mean said Emma
There was a little pause
The two women so far apart yet so near so different yet so like gazed far down into each others soul
Miss it dont you
said Hortense
Yes dont you
Do I
Say She turned and indicated the women surging up and down the store aisles and her glance and gesture were replete with contempt
Say look at em
Wandering around here aimless as a lot of chickens in a barnyard
Half of em are here because they havent got anything else to do
Think of it
Ive watched em lots of times
They go pawing over silks and laces and trimmings just for the pleasure of feeling em
They stand in front of a glass case with a figure in it all dressed up in satin and furs and jewels and youd think they were worshiping an idol like they used to in the olden days
They dont seem to have anything to do
Nothing to occupy theirtheir heads
Say if I thought I was going to be like them in time I Hortense my dear child youreyoure happy arent you
Henry Well I should say we are
Im crazy about Henry and he thinks Im perfect
Honestly aint they a scream
They think theyre so big and manly and all and theyre just like kids aint it so
Were living in a fourroom apartment in Harlem
Weve got it fixed up too cozy for anything
Id like to come and see you said Emma
Hortense opened her eyes wide
Honestly if you would Lets go up now
Ive the car outside
Now
Why IId love it
They chattered like schoolgirls on the way uptownthese two who had found so much in common
The little apartment reached Hortense threw open the door with the confident gesture of the housekeeper who is not afraid to have her household taken by surprise whose housekeeping is an index of character
Hortense had been a cleancut little stenographer
Her correspondence had always been free from erasures thumbmarks errors
Her fourroom flat was as spotless as her typewritten letters had been
The kitchen shone in its blue and white and nickel
A canary chirped in the tiny diningroom
There were books and magazines on the sittingroom table
The bedroom was brave in its snowy spread and the toilet silver that had been Henrys gift to her the Christmas they became engaged
Emma examined everything exclaimed over everything admired everything
Hortense glowed like a rose
Do you really like it
I like the green velours in the sittingroom dont you
Its always so kind and cheerful
Were not all settled yet
I dont suppose we ever will be
Sundays Henry putters around putting up shelves and fooling around with a can of paint
I always tell him he ought to have lived on a farm where hed have elbowroom
No wonder youre so happy and busy Emma exclaimed and patted the girls fresh young cheek
Hortense was silent a moment
Im happy she said at last but I aint busy
Andwell if youre not busy you cant be happy very long can you
No said Emma idleness when youre not used to it is misery
There
Youve said it
Its like running on halftime when youre used to a dayandnight shift
Somethings lacking
It isnt that Henry isnt grand to me because he is
Evenings were so happy that we just sit and grin at each other and half the time we forget to go to a movie
After Henry leaves in the morning I get to work
I suppose in the old days when women used to have to chop the kindling and catch the water for washing in a rainbarrel and keep up a fire in the kitchen stove and do their own bread baking and all it used to keep em hustling
But my goodness
A fourroom flat for two isnt any work
By eleven Im through
Ive straightened everything from the bed to the refrigerator the marketings done and the dinner vegetables are sitting around in cold water
The mending for two is a joke
Henry says its a wonder I dont sew doublebreasted buttons on his undershirts
Emma was not smiling
But then neither was Hortense
She was talking lightly seemingly but her pretty face was quite serious
The big noise in my day is when Henry comes home at six
That was all right and natural I suppose in those times when a quiltingbee was a wild afternoons work and teaching school was the most advanced job a woman could hold down
Emma was gazing fascinated at the girls sparkling face
Her own eyes were very bright and her lips were parted
Tell me Hortense she said now what does Henry say to all this
Have you told him how you feel
Well II talked to him about it once or twice
I told him that Ive got about twentyfour solid hours a week that I might be getting fifty cents an hour for
You know I worked for a manuscripttypewriting concern before I came over to Bucksplays and stories and that kind of thing
They used to like my work because I never queered their speeches by leaving out punctuation or mixing up the characters
The manager there said I could have work any time I wanted it
Ive got my own typewriter
I got it second hand when I first started in
Henry picks around on it sometimes evenings
I hardly ever touch it
Its getting rustyand so am I
It isnt just the money you want Hortense
Are you sure
Of course Id like the money
That extra coming in would mean booksIm crazy about reading and so is Henryand theaters and lots of things we cant afford now
But that isnt all
Henry dont want to be a shippingclerk all his life
Hes crazy about mechanics and that kind of stuff
But the books that he needs cost a lot
Dont you suppose Id be proud to feel that the extra money Id earned would lift him up where he could have a chance to be something
But Henry is dead set against it
He says he is the one thats going to earn the money around here
I try to tell him that Im used to using my mind
He laughs and pinches my cheek and tells me to use it thinking about him
She stopped suddenly and regarded Emma with consciencestricken eyes
You dont think Im running down Henry do you
My goodness I dont want you to think that Id change back again for a million dollars because I wouldnt
She looked up at Emma consciencestricken
Emma came swiftly over and put one hand on the girls shoulder
I dont think it
Not for a minute
I know that the world is full of Henrys and that the number of Hortenses is growing larger and larger
I dont know if the fourroom flats are to blame or whether its just a natural development
But the HenryHortense situation seems to be spreading to the nineroomandthreebaths apartments too
Hortense nodded a knowing head
I kind of thought so from the way you were listening
The two standing there gazing at each other almost shyly suddenly began to laugh
The laugh was a safetyvalve
Then quite as suddenly both became serious
That seriousness had been the undercurrent throughout
I wonder said Emma very gently if a small Henry some day wont provide you with an outlet for all that storedup energy
Hortense looked up very bravely
Maybe
Youyou must have been about my age when your boy was born
Did he make you feeldifferent
The shade of sadness that always came at the mention of those unhappy years of her early marriage crept into Emmas face now
That was not the same dear she explained
I hadnt your sort of Henry
You see my boy was my only excuse for living
Youll never know what that means
And when things grew altogether impossible and I knew that I must earn a living for Jock and myself I just did itthats all
I had to
Hortense thought that over for one deliberate moment
Her brows were drawn in a frown
Ill tell you what I think she announced at last though I dont know that I can just exactly put it into words
I mean this Some people are just bound toto give to build up things towell to manufacture because they just cant help it
Its in em and its got to come out
Dynamosthats what Henrys technical books would call them
Youre onea great big one
Im one
Just a little tiny one
But its sparking away there all the time and it might as well be put to some use mightnt it
Emma bent down and kissed the troubled forehead and then very tenderly the pretty puckered lips
Little Hortense she said youre asking a great big question
I can answer it for myself but I cant answer it for you
Its too dangerous
I wouldnt if I could
Emma waiting in the hall for the lift looked back at the slim little figure in the doorway
There was a droop to the shoulders
Emmas heart smote her
Dont bother your head about all this little girl she called back to her
Just forget to be ambitious and remember to be happy
Thats much the better way
Hortense from the doorway grinned a rather wicked little grin
When are you going back to the office Mrs
Buck
she asked quietly enough
What makes you think Im going back at all
demanded Emma stepping into the shaky little elevator
I dont think it retorted Hortense once more the pert
I know it
Emma knew it too
She had known it from the moment that she shook hands in her compact
There was still one week remaining of the stipulated three months
It seemed to Emma that that one week was longer than the combined eleven
But she went through with colors flying
Whatever Emma McChesney Buck did she did well
But then T A Buck had done his part well tooso well that on the final day Emma felt a sinking at her heart
He seemed so satisfied with affairs as they were
He was apparently so content to drop all thought of business when he left the office for his home
Emma had planned a very special little dinner that evening
She wore a very special gown tooone of the new ones
T A noticed it at once and the dinner as well being that kind of husband
Still Annie the cook complained later to the parlormaid about the thanklessness of cooking dinners for folks who didnt eat moren a mouthful anyway
Dinner over Well Emma
said T A Buck
Light your cigar T A said Emma
Youll need it
T A lighted it with admirable leisureliness sent out a great puff of fragrant smoke and surveyed his wife through halfclosed lids
Beneath his air of ease there was a tension
Well Emma
he said again gently
Emma looked at him a moment appreciatively
She had too much poise and balance and control herself not to recognize and admire those qualities in others
T A if I had been what they call a homebody we wouldnt be married today would we
No
You knew plenty of homewomen that you could have married didnt you
I didnt ask them Emma but You know what I mean
Now listen T A Ive loafed for three months
Ive lolled and lazied and languished
And Ive never been so tired in my lifenot even when we were taking January inventory
Another month of this and Id be an old old woman
I understand now what it is that brings that hard tired stony look into the faces of the idle women
They have to work so hard to try to keep happy
I suppose if I had been a homebody all my life I might be hardened to this kind of thing
But its too late now
And Im thankful for it
Those women who want to shop and dress and drive and play are welcome to my share of it
If I am to be punished in the next world for my wickedness in this I know what form my torture will take
I shall have to go from shop to shop with a piece of lace in my hand matching a sample of insertion
Fifteen years of being in the thick of it spoil one for tatting and tea
The world is full of homebodies I suppose
And theyre happy
I suppose I might have been one too if I hadnt been obliged to get out and hustle
But its too late to learn now
Besides I dont want to
If I do try Ill be destroying the very thing that attracted you to me in the first place
Remember what you said about the Fifth Avenue girl
But Emma interrupted Buck very quietly I dont want you to try
Emma with a rush of words at her very lips paused eyed him for a doubtful moment asked a faltering question
But it was your planyou said you wanted me to be here when you came home and when you left didnt you
Do you mean you I mean that Ive missed my business partner every minute for three months
All the time weve been going to those fool dinners and all that kind of thing Ive been bursting to talk skirts to you
Isay Emma Adlers designed a new modela full one of course but theres something wrong with it
I cant put my finger on the flaw but Emma came swiftly over to his chair
Make a sketch of it cant you
she said
From his pocket Buck drew a pencil an envelope and fell to sketching rapidly squinting down through his cigar smoke as he worked
Its like this he began absorbed and happy you see where the fulness begins at the knee Yes
prompted Emma breathlessly
Two hours later they were still bent over the much marked bit of paper
But their interest in it was not that of those who would solve a perplexing problem
It was the lingering satisfied contemplation of a task accomplished
Emma straightened leaned back sigheda victorious happy sigh
And to think she said marveling to think that I once envied the women who had nothing to do but the things Ive done in the last three months
Buck had risen stretched luxuriously yawned
Now he came over to his wife and took her head in his two hands cozily and stood a moment looking into her shining eyes
Emma I may have mentioned this once or twice before but perhaps youll still be interested to know that I think youre a wonder
A wonder
Youre the Oh well we wont quarrel about that smiled Emma brazenly
But I wonder if Adler will agree with us when he sees what weve done to his newest skirt design
Suddenly a new thought seemed to strike her
She was off down the hall
Buck following in a leisurely manner hands in pockets stood in the bedroom door and watched her plunge into the innermost depths of the clothescloset
Whats the idea Emma
Looking for something came back his wifes muffled tones
A long wait
Can I help
Ive got it
cried Emma and emerged triumphant flushed smiling holding a garment at arms length aloft
What Emma shook it smartly turned it this way and that held it up under her chin by the sleeves
Why girl
exclaimed Buck all agrin its the The blue serge Emma finished for him with the white collars and cuffs
And whats more young man its the little blue hat with the whatchamacallems on it
And praise be
Im wearing em both downtown tomorrow morning
V HOOPS MY DEAR
Emma McChesney Buck always vigorously disclaimed any knowledge of that dreamyeyed damsel known as Inspiration
T A Buck her husbandpartner accused her of being on intimate terms with the lady
So did the adoring office staff of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company
Out in the workshop itself the designers and cutters those jealous artists of the pencil shears and yardstick looked on in awed admiration on those rare occasions when the feminine member of the business took the scissors in her firm white hands and slashed boldly into a shimmering length of petticoatsilk
When she put down the great shears there lay on the table the detached parts of that which the appreciative and experienced eyes of the craftsmen knew to be a new and original variation of that elastic garment known as the underskirt
For weeks preceding one of these cutting exhibitions Emma was likely to be not quite her usual brisk self
A mystic glow replaced the alert brightness of her eye
Her wideawake manner gave way to one of almost sluggish inactivity
The outer office noting these things would lift its eyebrows significantly
Another hunch
it would whisper
The last time she beat the rest of the trade by six weeks with that elastictop gusset
Inspiration working Emma
T A Buck would ask noting the symptoms
It isnt inspiration T A
Nothing of the kind
Its just an attack of imagination complicated by clothesinstinct
Thats all that ails Poiret Buck would retort
Early in the autumn when women were still walking with an absurd sidewise gait like a duck or a filly that is too tightly hobbled the junior partner of the firm began to show unmistakable signs of business aberration
A blight seemed to have fallen upon her bright little office usually humming with activity
The machinery of her day ordinarily as noiseless and well ordered as a thing on ball bearings now rasped creaked jerked stood still jolted on again
A bustling clerk or stenographer entering with paper or memorandum would find her bent over her desk pencil in hand absorbed in a rough drawing that seemed to bear no relation to the skirt of the day
The margin of her morning paper was filled with queer little scrawls by the time she reached the office
She drew weird lines with her fork on the tablecloth at lunch
These hieroglyphics she covered with a quick hand like a bashful schoolgirl when any one peeped
Tell a fellow what its going to be cant you
pleaded Buck
I got one glimpse yesterday when you didnt know I was looking over your shoulder
It seemed a pass between an overgrown Zeppelin and an apple dumpling
So I know it cant be a skirt
Come on Emma tell your old man
Not yet Emma would reply dreamily
Buck would strike an attitude intended to intimidate
If you have no sense of what is due me as your husband then I demand as senior partner of this firm to know what it is that is taking your time which rightfully belongs to this business
Go away T A and stop pestering me
What do you think Im designinga doily
Buck turning to go to his own office threw a last retort over his shouldera rather sobering one this time
Whatever it is it had better be goodwith business what it is and skirts what they are
Emma lifted her head to reply to that
It isnt what they are that interests me
Its what theyre going to be
Buck paused in the doorway
Going to be
Anybody can see that
Underneath that full fool flaring overdrape the real skirt is as tight as ever
I dont think the spring models will show an inch of real difference
I tell you Emma its serious
Emma apparently absorbed in her work did not reply to this
But a vague something about the back of her head told T A Buck that she was laughing at him
The knowledge only gave him new confidence in this resourceful manysided lovable levelheaded partnerwife of his
Two weeks went byfoursixeight
Emma began to look a little thin
Her bright color was there only when she was overtired or excited
The workrooms began to talk of new designs for spring though it was scarcely midwinter
The head designer came forward timidly with a skirt that measured a yard around the bottom
Emma looked at it tried to keep her lower lip prisoner between her teeth failed and began to laugh helplessly almost hysterically
Amazement in the faces of Buck and Koritz the designer became consternation then in the designer resentment
Koritz dark undersized with the eyes of an Oriental and the lean sensitive fingers of one who creates shivered a little like a plant that is swept by an icy blast
Buck came over and laid one hand on his wifes shaking shoulder
Emma youre overtired
Thisthis thing youve been slaving over has been too much for you
With one hand Emma reached up and patted the fingers that rested protectingly on her shoulder
With the other she wiped her eyes then all contrition grasped the slender brown hand of the offended Koritz
Bennie please forgive me
II didnt mean to laugh
I wasnt laughing at your new skirt
You think its too wide maybe huh
Bennie Koritz said and held it up doubtfully
Too wide
For a moment Emma seemed threatened with another attack of that inexplicable laughter
She choked it back resolutely
No Bennie not too wide
Ill tell you tomorrow why I laughed
Then perhaps youll laugh with me
Bennie draping his despised skirtmodel over one arm had the courage to smile even now though grimly
I laughsure he said showing his white teeth now
But the laugh will be I bet you on melike it was when you designed that knickerbocker before the trade knew such a thing could be
Impulsively Emma grasped his hand and shook it as though she found a certain needed encouragement in the loyalty of this sallow little Russian
Bennie youre a true artistbecause youre big enough to praise the work of a fellow craftsman when you recognize its value
And Koritz the dull red showing under the olive of his cheeks went back to his cuttingtable happy
Buck bent forward eagerly
Youre going to tell me now Emma
Its finished
Tonightat home
I want to be the first to try it on
Ill play model
A private exhibition just for you
Its not only finished it is patented
Patented
But why
What is it anyway
A new fastener
I thought it was a skirt
Wait until you see it
Youll think I should have had it copyrighted as well not to say passed by the national board of censors
Do you mean to say that Im to be the entire audience at the premiere of this new model
You are to be audience critic orchestra boxholder patron and Diamond Jim Brady
Now run along into your own officewont you dear
I want to get out these letters
And she pressed the button that summoned a stenographer
T A Buck resigned admiring and anticipatory went
Annie the cook was justified that evening in her bitter complaint
Her excellent dinner received scant enough attention from these two
They hurried through it like eager brighteyed schoolchildren who have been promised a treat
Two scarlet spots glowed in Emmas cheeks
Bucks eyes through the haze of his afterdinner cigar were luminous
Now
No not yet
I want you to smoke your cigar and digest your dinner and read your paper
I want you to twiddle your thumbs a little and look at your watch
Firstnight curtains are always late in rising arent they
Well
She turned on the full glare of the chandelier turned it off went about flicking on the softshaded wall lights and the lamps
Turn your chair so that your back will be toward the door
He turned it obediently
Emma vanished
From the direction of her bedroom there presently came the sounds of dresser drawers hurriedly opened and shut with a bang of a slipper dropped on the hardwood floor a tune hummed in an absentminded absorption under the breath an excited little laugh nervously stifled
Buck in his role of audience began to clap impatiently and to stamp with his feet on the floor
No gallery
Emma called in from the hall
Remember the temperamental family on the floor below
A silencethen Im coming
Shut your eyes and prepare to be jarred by the Buck balloonpetticoat
There was a rustling of silks a little rush to the center of the big room a breathless pause a sharp snap of finger and thumb
Buck opened his eyes
He opened his eyes
Then he closed them and opened them again quickly as we do sometimes when we are unwilling to believe that which we see
What he beheld was this A very pretty very flushed very brighteyed woman her blond hair dressed quaintly after the fashion of the early Sixties her arms and shoulders bare a pinkslip with shoulderstraps in lieu of a bodice andhe passed a bewildered hand over his eyes a skirt that billowed and flared and flounced and spread in a great graceful circlea skirt strangely light for all its fulnessa skirt like and yet somehow unlike those garments seen in ancient copies of Godeys Lady Book
That cant beyou dont meanwhatwhat IS it
stammered Buck dismayed
Emma her arms curved above her head like a balletdancers pirouetted curtsied very low so that the skirt spread all about her on the floor like the petals of a flower
Hoops my dear
Hoops
echoed Buck in weak protest
Hoops my DEAR
Emma stroked one silken fold with approving fingers
Our new leader for spring
But Emma youre joking
She stared suddenly serious
You meanyou dont like it
Like it
For a fancydress costume yes but as a petticoat for everyday wear to be made up by us for our customers
But of course youre playing a trick on me
He laughed a little weakly and came toward her
You cant catch me that way old girl
Its darned becoming EmmaIll say that
He bent down smiling
Ill allow you to kiss me
And then try me with the real surprise will you
Her coquetry vanished
Her smile fled with it
Her pretty pose was abandoned
Mrs T A Buck wife gave way to Emma McChesney Buck business woman
She stiffened a little as though bracing herself for a verbal encounter
Youll get used to it
I expected you to be jolted at the first shock of it
I was myselfwhen the idea came to me
Buck passed a frenzied forefinger under his collar as though it had suddenly grown too tight for him
Used to it
I dont want to get used to it
Its preposterous
You cant be serious
No woman would wear a garment like that
For five years skirts have been tighter and tighter Until this summer they became tightest interrupted Emma
They could go no farther
I knew that meant About face
I knew it meant not a slightly wider skirt but a wildly wider skirt
A skirt as bouffant as the other had been scant
I was sure it wouldnt be a gradual process at all but a mushroom growthhobbles today hoops tomorrow
Study the history of womens clothes and youll find that has always been true
Look here Emma began Buck desperately youre wrong all wrong
Here let me throw this scarf over your shoulders
Now well sit down and talk this thing over sensibly
Ill agree to the scarfshe drew a soft silken fringed shawl about her and immediately one thought of a certain vivid brilliant portrait of a hoopskirted dancerbut dont ask me to sit down
Id rebound like a toy balloon
Ive got to convince you of this thing
Ill have to do it standing
Buck sank into his chair and dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief
Youll never convince me sitting or standing
Emma I know I fought the knickerbocker when you originated it and I know that it turned out to be a magnificent success
But this is different
The knicker was practical this things absurdits impossible
This is an age of activity
In Civil War days women minced daintily along when they walked at all
They stitched on samplers by way of diversion
What has all that to do with it
inquired Emma sweetly
Everything
Use a little logic
Logic
In a discussion about womens dress
T A Im surprised
But Emma be reasonable
Good Lord
Youre usually clearsighted enough
Our mode of living has changed in the last fifty yearsour methods of transit our pastimes customs everything
Imagine a woman trying to climb a Fifth Avenue bus in one of those things
Fancy her in a hot set of tennis
Women use streetcars automobiles airships
Can you see a subway train full of hoopskirted clerks stenographers and models
Streetcar steps arent built for it
Officebuilding elevators cant stand for it
Sixroom apartments wont accommodate em
Theyre fantastic wild improbable
Youre wrong Emmaall wrong
She had listened patiently enough never once attempting to interrupt
But on her lips was the maddening halfsmile of one whose rebuttal is ready
Now she perched for a moment at the extreme edge of the arm of a chair
Her skirt subsided decorously
Buck noticed that with surprise even in the midst of his heated protest
T A youve probably forgotten but those are the very arguments used when the hobble was introduced
Preposterous people saidimpossible
Women couldnt walk in em
Wouldnt couldnt sit down in em
Women couldnt run play tennis skate in them
The car steps were too high for them
Well what happened
Women had to walk in them and a new gait became the fashion
Women took lessons in how to sit down in them
They slashed them for tennis and skating
And streetcar companies all over the country lowered the car steps to accommodate them
Whats true for the hobble holds good for the hoop
Women will cease to singlefoot and learn to undulate when they walk
Theyll widen the car platforms
Theyll sit on top the Fifth Avenue buses and youll never give them a second thought
The things dont stay where they belong
Ive seen em misbehave in musical comedies argued Buck miserably
Thats where my patent comes in
The old hoop was cumbersome unwieldy clumsy
The new skirt by my patent featherboning process is made light graceful easily managed
T A I predict that by midsummer a tight skirt will be as rare a sight as a full one was a year ago
Nonsense
Were not quarreling are we
Quarreling
I rather think not
A man can have his own opinion cant he
It appeared however that he could not
For when they had threshed it out inch by inch as might two partners whose only bond was business it was Emma who won
Remember Im not convinced Buck warned her Im only beaten by superior force
But I do believe in your womans intuitionIll say that
It has never gone wrong
Im banking on it
Its womans intuition when we win Emma observed thoughtfully
When we lose its a foolish feminine notion
There were to be no halfway measures
The skirt was to be the feature of the spring line
Cutters and designers were one with Buck in thinking it a freak garment
Emma reminded them that the same thing had been said of the hobble on its appearance
In February Billy Spalding veteran skirtsalesman led a flying wedge of six on a testtrip that included the Middle West and the Coast
Their sampletrunks had to be rebuilt to accommodate the new model
Spalding shirtsleeved whistling dolorously eyed each garment with a look of bristling antagonism
Spalding sold skirts on commission
Emma surveying his labors lifted a quizzical eyebrow
If youre going to sell that skirt as enthusiastically as you pack it youd better stay here in New York and save the house traveling expenses
Spalding ceased to whistle
He held up a billowy sample and gazed at it
Honestly Mrs Buck you know Id try to sell pretzels in London if you asked me to
But do you really think any woman alive would be caught wearing a garment like this in these days
Not only do I think it Billy Im certain of it
This new petticoat makes me the Lincoln of the skirt trade
Im literally freeing my sisters from the shackles that have bound their ankles for five years
Spalding unimpressed folded another skirt
Um maybe
But whats that line about slaves hugging their chains
The day following Spalding and his flying squad scattered to spread the light among the skirt trade
And things went wrong from the start
The first week showed an ominous lack of those cheering epistles beginning Enclosed please find etc
The second was worse
The third was equally bad
The fourth was final
The second week in March Spalding returned from a territory which had always been known as firmly wedded to the T A Buck Featherloom petticoat
The Middle West would have none of him
They held the postmortem in Emmas bright little office and that lady herself seemed to be strangely sunny and undaunted considering the completeness of her defeat
She sat at her desk now very interested very brighteyed very calm
Buck in a chair at the side of her desk was interested too but not so calm
Spalding who was accustomed to talk while standing leaned against the desk feet crossed brows furrowed
As he talked he emphasized his remarks by jabbing the air with his pencil
Well said Emma quietly it didnt go
It didnt even start corrected Spalding
But why
demanded Buck
Why
Spalding leaned forward a little eagerly
Ill tell you something When I started out with that little garment I thought it was a joke
Before Id been out with it a week I began to like it
In ten days I was crazy about it and I believed in it from the waistband to the hem
On the level Mrs Buck I think its a wonder
Now can you explain that
Yes said Emma you didnt like it at first because it was a shock to you
It outraged all your ideas of what a skirt ought to be
Then you grew accustomed to it
Then you began to see its good points
Why couldnt you make the trade get your viewpoint
This is why Out in Manistee and Oshkosh and Terre Haute the girls have just really learned the trick of walking in tight skirts
Its as impossible to convince a Middle West buyer that the exaggerated full skirt is going to be worn next summer as it would be to prove to him that men are going to wear sunbonnets
They thought I was trying to sell em masquerade costumes
I may believe in it and you may believe in it and T A but the girls from Joplinwell theyre from Joplin
And theyre waiting to hear from headquarters
T A Buck crossed one leg over the other and sat up with a little sigh
Well that settles it doesnt it
he said
It does not replied Emma McChesney Buck crisply
If they want to hear from headquarters they wont have long to wait
Now Emma dont try to push this thing if it T A please dont look so forgiving
Id much rather have you reproach me
Its you Im thinking of not the skirt
But I want you to think of the skirt too
Weve gone into this thing and it has cost us thousands
Dont think Im going to sit quietly by and watch those thousands trickle out of our hands
Weve played our first card
It didnt take a trick
Heres another
Buck and Spalding were leaning forward interested attentive
There was that in Emmas vivid glowing face which did not mean defeat
March fifteenth at Madison Square Garden there is to be held the first annual exhibition of the Society for the Promotion of American Styles for American Women
For one hundred years weve taken our fashions as Paris dictated regardless of whether they outraged our sense of humor or decency or of fitness
This year the American designer is going to have a chance
Am I an American designer T A Billy
Yes
in chorus
Then I shall exhibit that skirt on a live model at the First Annual American Fashion Show next month
Every skirtbuyer in the country will be there
If it takes hold there its madeand so are we
March came and with it an army of men and women buyers dependent for the first time in their business careers on the ingenuity of the American brain
The keeneyed legions that had advanced on Europe early armed with letters of creditthe vast horde that returned each spring and autumn laden with their spoilshats gowns laces linens silks embroiderieswere obliged to content themselves with what was to be found in their own camp
Clever manager that she was Emma took as much pains with her model as with the skirt itself
She chose a girl whose demure prettiness and quiet charm would enhance the possibilities of the skirts practicability in the eye of the shrewd buyer
Gertrude the model developed a real interest in the success of the petticoat
Emma knew enough about the psychology of crowds to realize how this increased her chances for success
The much heralded fashion show was to open at one oclock on the afternoon of March fifteenth
At ten oclock that morning there breezed in from Chicago a tall slim alert young man who made straight for the offices of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company walked into the junior partners private office and took that astonished lady in his two strong arms
Jock McChesney
gasped his rumpled mother emerging from the hug
Ive been hungry for a sight of you
She was submerged in a second hug
Come here to the window where I can get a real look at you
Why didnt you wire me
What are you doing away from your own job
Hows business
And why come today of all days when I cant make a fuss over you
Jock McChesney brighteyed clearskinned steady of hand stood up well under the satisfied scrutiny of his adoring mother
He smiled down at her
Wanted to surprise you
Here for three reasonsthe Abbott Grapejuice advertising contract you and Grace
And why cant you make a fuss over me Id like to know
Emma told him
His keen quick mind required little in the way of explanation
But why didnt you let me in on it sooner
Because son nothing explains harder than embryo success
I always prefer to wait until its grown up and let it do its own explaining
But the thing ought to have national advertising Jock insisted with the advertising experts lightning grasp of its possibilities
What that skirt needs is publicity
Why didnt you let me handle Yes I know dear but you havent seen the skirt
It wont do to ram it down their throats
I want to ease it to them first
I want them to get used to it
It failed utterly on the road because it jarred their notion of what a petticoat ought to be
Thats due to five years of sheath skirts
But supposejust for the sake of argument that it doesnt strike them right this afternoon
Then its gone thats all
Six months from now every skirtfactory in the country will be manufacturing a similar garment
People will be ready for it then
Ive just tried to cut in ahead of the rest
Perhaps I shouldnt have tried to do it
Jock hugged her again at that to the edification of the office windows across the way
Gad youre a wiz mother
Now listen I phoned Grace when I got in
Shes going to meet me here at one
Ill chase over to the office now on this grapejuice thing and come back here in time for lunch
Is T A in
Ill look in on him a minute
Well all lunch together and then Cant do it son
The show opens at one
Gertrude my model comes on at three
Shes going to have the stage to herself for ten minutes during which shell make four changes of costume to demonstrate the usefulness of the skirt for every sort of gown from chiffon to velvet
Come back here at one if you like
If Im not here come over to the show
Butlunch
Id choke
At twelvethirty there scampered into Emmas office a very whitefaced roundeyed little stockgirl
Emma deep in a lastminute discussion with Buck had a premonition of trouble before the girl gasped out her message
Oh Mrs Buck Gerties awful sick
Sick
echoed Emma and Buck in duet
Then Emma But she cant be
Its impossible
She was all right a half hour ago
She was hurrying down the hall as she spoke
Where is she
Theyve got her on one of the tables in the workroom
Shes moaning awful
Gerties appendix with that innate sense of the dramatic so often found in temperamental appendices had indeed chosen this moment to call attention to itself
Gertie the demurely pretty and quietly charming was rolled in a very tight ball on the workroom cuttingtable
At one oclock she was on her way home in a cab under the care of a doctor Miss Kelly the bookkeeper and Jock who coming in gaily at one had been pressed into service bewildered but willing
Three rather tragic figures stared at one another in the junior partners office
They were Emma Buck and Grace Galt Jocks wifetobe
Grace Galt slim lovely girlish was known at twentyfour as one of the most expert copy writers in the advertising world
In her clearheaded capable manner she tried to suggest a way out of the difficulty now
But surely the worlds full of girls she said
Its late I know but any theatrical agency will send a girl over
Thats just what I tried to avoid Emma replied
I wanted to show this skirt on a sweet pretty refined sort of girl who looks and acts like a lady
One of those blond show girls would kill it
Gloom settled down again over the three
Emma broke the silence with a rueful little laugh
I think she said that perhaps youre right T A and this is the Lords way of showing me that the world is not quite ready for this skirt
Youre not beaten yet Emma Buck assured her vigorously
How about this new girlwhats her nameMyrtle
Shes one of those thin limp ones isnt she
Try her
I will said Emma
Youre right
Im not beaten yet
Ive had to fight for everything worth while in my life
Im superstitious about it now
When things come easy Im afraid of them
Then to the stockgirl Annie tell Myrtle I want to see her
Silence fell again upon the three
Myrtle very limp very thin very languid indeed roused them at her entrance
The hopeful look in Emmas eyes faded as she beheld her
Myrtle was so obviously limp so hopelessly new
Annie says you want me to take Gerties place drawled Myrtle striking a magazinecover attitude
I dont know that you are just theertype but perhaps if youre willing Of course I didnt come here as a model said Myrtle and sagged on the other hip
But as a special favor to you Im willing to try itat special models rates
Emma ran a somewhat frenzied hand through her hair
Then as a special favor to me will you begin by trying to stand up straight please
That debutante slouch would kill a queens coronation costume
Myrtle straightened slumped again
I cant help it if I am willowylistlessly
Your hair
Myrtles hand went vaguely to her head
I cant have you wear it that way
Why this is the French roll
protested Myrtle offended
Then do it in a German bun
snapped Emma
Any way but that
Will you walk please
Walkdully
Yes walk I want to see how you Myrtle walked across the room
A groan came from Emma
I thought so
She took a long breath
Myrtle listen That Australian crawl was necessary when our skirts were so narrow we had to negotiate a curbing before we could take it
But the skirt youre going to demonstrate is wide
Like that
Youre practically a free woman in it
Step out
Stride
Swing
Walk
Myrtle tried it stumbled sulked
Emma half smiling half woeful patted the girls shoulder
Oh I see youre wearing a tight one
Well run in and get into the skirt
Miss Loeb will help you
Then come back hereand quickly please
The three looked at each other in silence
It was a silence brimming with eloquent meaning
Each sought encouragement in the eyes of the otherand failed to find it
Failing they broke into helpless laughter
It proved a safetyvalve
She may do Emmawhen she has her hair done differently and if shell only stand up
But Emma shook her head
T A something tells me youre going to have a wonderful chance to say I told you so
at three oclock this afternoon
You know I wouldnt say it Emma
Yes I do know it dear
But whats the difference if the chance is there
Suspense settled down on the little office
Billy Spalding entered smiling
After five minutes of waiting even his buoyant spirits sank
Dont you thinkif you were to go in andand sort of help adjust things suggested Buck vaguely
No I dont want to prop her up
Shell have to stand alone when she gets there
Shell either do or not
When she enters that door Ill know
When Myrtle entered wearing the fascinatingly fashioned new model they all knew
Emma spoke decisively
That settles it
Whats the matter
Dont it look all right
demanded Myrtle
Take it off Myrtle
Then to the others as Myrtle sulking left the room I can stand to see that skirt die if necessary
But I wont help murder it
But Mrs Buck protested Spalding almost tearfully youve got to exhibit that skirt
Youve got to
Emma shook a sorrowing head
That wouldnt be an exhibition Billy
It would be an expose
Spalding clapped a desperate hand to his bald head
If only I had Julian Eltinges shape Id wear it to the show for you myself
Thats all it needs now retorted Emma grimly
Whereupon Grace Galt spoke up in her clear decisive voice
Wait a minute she said quietly
Im going to wear that skirt at the fashion show
You
cried the three like a trained trio
Why not
demanded Grace Galt coolly
Then No dont tell me why not
I wont listen
But Emma equally cool would have none of it
Its impossible dear
Youre an angel to want to help me
But you must know its quite out of the question
Its nothing of the kind
This skirt isnt merely a fad
It has a fortune in it
Im business woman enough to know that
Youve got to let me do it
It isnt only for yourself
Its for T A and for the future of the firm
Do you suppose Id allow you to stand up before all those people
Why not
I dont know them
They dont know me
I can make them get the idea in that skirt
And Im going to do it
You dont object to me on the same grounds that you did to Myrtle do you
You
burst from the admiring Spalding
Say youd make a redflannel petticoat look like crepe de Chine and lace
There
said Grace triumphant
That settles it
And she was off down the hall
They stood a moment in stunned silence
Then But Jock
protested Emma following her What will Jock say
Grace
Grace dear
I cant let you do it
I cant
Just unhook this for me will you
replied Grace Galt sweetly
At two oclock Jock McChesney returned from his errand of mercy burst into the office to find mother stepfather and fiancee all flown
Where
What
he demanded of the outer office
Fashion show
chorused the office staff Might have waited for me Jock said to himself much injured
And hurled himself into a taxi
There was a crush of motors and carriages for a block on all sides of Madison Square Garden
He had to wait for what seemed an interminable time at the boxoffice
Then he began the task of worming his way through the closepacked throng in the great auditorium
It was a crowd such as the great place had not seen since the palmy days of the horse show
It was a crowd that sparkled and shone in silks and feathers and furs and jewels
Jove if mother has half a chance at this gang
Jock told himself
If only she has grabbed some one who can really show that skirt
He was swept with the crowd toward a high platform at the extreme end of the auditorium
All about that platform stood hundreds close packed faces raised eagerly the better to see the slight graceful girlish figure occupying the center of the stagea figure strangely familiar to Jocks eyes in spite of its quaintly billowing antebellum garb
She was speaking
Jock mouth agape eyes protruding ears straining heard as in a daze the sweet clear charmingly modulated voice The feature of the skirt ladies and gentlemen is that it gives a fulness without weight something which the skirtmaker has never before been able to achieve
This is due to the patent featherboning process invented by Mrs T A Buck of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company New York
Note please that it has all the advantages of our grandmothers hoopskirt but none of its awkward features
It is gracefulshe turned slowly lightlyit is bouffant she twirled on her toesit is practical serviceable elegant
It can be made up in any shade in any material silk lace crepe de Chine charmeuse taffeta
The T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company is prepared to fill orders for immediate Well Ill be darned
said Jock McChesney aloud
And again heedless of the protesting Shshshsh
that his neighbors turned upon him Well Illbedarned
A hand twitched his coat sleeve
He turned still dazed
His mother very pinkcheeked very brighteyed pulled him through the throng
As they reached the edge of the crowd there came a great burst of applause a buzz of conversation the turning shifting nodding staccato movements which mean approval in a mass of people
What the dickens
How
stammered Jock
Whendid shedid she Emma half smiling half tearful raised a protesting hand
I dont know
Dont ask me dear
And dont hate me for it
I tried to tell her not to but she insisted
And Jock shes done it I tell you
Shes done it
They love the skirt
Listen to em
Dont want to said Jock
Lead me to her
Angry dear
Me
No
ImIm proud of her
She hasnt only brains and looks that little girl shes got nervethe real kind
Gee how did I ever have the gall to ask her to marry me
Together they sped toward the door that led to the dressingrooms
Buck his fine eyes more luminous than ever as he looked at this wonderwife of his met them at the entrance
Shes waiting for you Jock he said smiling
Jock took the steps in one leap
Well T A

said Emma
Well Emma
said T A
Which burst of eloquence was interrupted abruptly by a short squat dark man who seized Emmas hand in his left and Bucks in his right and pumped them up and down vigorously
It was that volatile voluble person known to the skirt trade as Abel I Fromkin of the Fromkin Formfit Skirt
It Clings
Im looking everywhere for you
he panted
Then his shrewd little eyes narrowing You want to talk business
Not here said Buck abruptly
Surehere insisted Fromkin
Say thats me
When I got a thing on my mind I like to settle it
How much you take for the rights to that skirt
Take for it
exclaimed Emma in the tone a mother would use to one who has suggested taking a beloved child from her
Now wait a minute
Dont get mad
You aint started that skirt right
It should have been advertised
Its too much of a shock
Youll see
They wont buy
Theyre afraid of it
Ill take it off your hands and push it right see
I offer you forty thousand for the rights to make that skirt and advertise it as the Fromkin Fullflounce Skirt
It Flares
 Emma smiled
How much
she asked quizzically
Abel I Fromkin gulped
Fifty thousand he said
Fifty thousand repeated Emma quietly and looked at Buck
Thanks Mr Fromkin
I know now that if its worth fifty thousand to you today as the Fromkin Fullflounce Skirt
It Flares
then its worth one hundred and fifty thousand to us as the T A Buck BalloonPetticoat
It Billows
 And it was
VI SISTERS UNDER THEIR SKIN Women who know the joys and sorrows of a pay envelope do not speak of girls who work as Working Girls
Neither do they use the term Laboring Class as one would speak of a distinct and separate race like the Ethiopian
Emma McChesney Buck was no exception to this rule
Her fifteen years of mansize work for a mansize salary in the employ of the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company New York precluded that
In those days she had been Mrs Emma McChesney known from coast to coast as the most successful traveling saleswoman in the business
It was due to her that no feminine clothescloset was complete without a Featherloom dangling from one hook
During those fifteen years she had educated her son Jock McChesney and made a man of him she had worked fought saved triumphed smiled under hardship and she had acquired a broad and deep knowledge of those fascinating and diversified subjects which we lump carelessly under the heading of Human Nature
She was Mrs T A Buck now wife of the head of the firm and partner in the most successful skirt manufactory in the country
But the hardworking clearthinking saneacting habits of those fifteen years still clung
Perhaps this explained why every machinegirl in the big bright shop back of the offices raised adoring eyes when Emma entered the workroom
Italian German Hungarian Russianthey lifted their faces toward this source of love and sympathetic understanding as naturally as a plant turns its leaves toward the sun
They glowed under her praise they confided to her their troubles they came to her with their joysand they copied her clothes
This last caused her some uneasiness
When Mrs T A Buck wore blue serge an epidemic of blue serge broke out in the workroom
Did Emmas spring hat flaunt flowers the elevators at closing time looked like gardens abloom
If she appeared on Monday morning in severely tailored whitelinen blouse the shop on Tuesday was a Boston seminary in its starched primness
It worries me Emma told her husbandpartner
I cant help thinking of the story of the girl and the pet chameleon
What would happen if I were to forget myself some day and come down to work in black velvet and pearls
Theyd manage it somehow Buck assured her
I dont know just how but Im sure that twentyfour hours later our shop would look like a Buckingham drawingroom when the court is in mourning
Emma never ceased to marvel at their ingenuity at their almost uncanny clothesinstinct
Their cheap skirts hung and fitted with an art as perfect as that of a Fiftyseventh Street modiste their blouses in some miraculous way were of todays style down to the last detail of cuff or collar or stitching their hats were of the shape that the season demanded set at the angle that the season approved and finished with just that repression of decoration which is known as single trimming
They wore their clothes with a chic that would make the farfamed Parisian outriere look dowdy and down at heel in comparison
Upper Fifth Avenue during the shopping or teahour has been sung painted vaunted boasted
Its furs and millinery its eyes and figure its complexion and ankles have flashed out at us from ten thousand magazine covers have been adjectived in reams of Sundaysupplement stories
Who will picture Lower Fifth Avenue between five and six when New Yorks unsung beauties pour into the streets from a thousand loftbuildings
Theirs is no mere empty pinkandwhite prettiness
Poverty can make prettiness almost poignantly lovely for it works with a scalpel
Your Twentysixth Street beauty has a certain wistful appeal that your Fortysixth Street beauty lacks her very bravado too which falls just short of boldness adds a final piquant touch
In the face of the girl who works whether she be a spindlelegged errandgirl or a tenthousandayear foreign buyer you will find both vivacity and depth of expression
What she loses in softness and bloom she gains in a something that peeps from her eyes that lurks in the corners of her mouth
Emma never tired of studying themthese girls with their firm slim throats their lovely faces their Oriental eyes and their conscious grace
Often as she looked an unaccountable mist of tears would blur her vision
So that sunny little room whose door was marked MRS BUCK had come to be more than a mere private office for the transaction of business
It was a clearinghouse for trouble it was a shrine a confessional and a court of justice
When Carmela Colarossi her face swollen with weeping told a story of parental harshness grown unbearable Emma would put aside business to listen and six oclock would find her seated in the dark and smelly Colarossi kitchen trying with all her tact and patience and sympathy to make home life possible again for the flashingeyed Carmela
When the deft brown fingers of Otti Markis became clumsy at her machine and her wage slumped unaccountably from sixteen to six dollars a week it was in Emmas quiet little office that it became clear why Ottis eyes were shadowed and why Ottis mouth drooped so pathetically
Emma prescribed a love philter made up of common sense understanding and world wisdom
Otti took it only half comprehending but sure of its power
In a week Ottis eyes were shadowless her lips smiling her payenvelope bulging
But it was in Sophy Kumpf that the T A Buck Company best exemplified its policy
Sophy Kumpf had come to Bucks thirty years before slim pinkcheeked brown haired
She was a grandmother now at fortysix broadbosomed broadhipped but still pink of cheek and brown of hair
In those thirty years she had spent just three away from Bucks
She had brought her children into the world she had fed them and clothed them and sent them to school had Sophy and seen them married and helped them to bring their children into the world in turn
In her round red wholesome face shone a great wisdom much love and that infinite understanding which is born only of bitter experience
She had come to Bucks when old T A was just beginning to make Featherlooms a national institution
She had seen his struggles his prosperity she had grieved at his death she had watched young T A take the reins in his unaccustomed hands and she had gloried in Emma McChesneys rise from office to salesroom from salesroom to road from road to private office and recognized authority
Sophy had left her early work far behind
She had her own desk now in the busy workshop and it was she who allotted the piecework marked it in her muchthumbed ledgerthat powerful ledger which at the weeks end decided just how plump or thin each payenvelope would be
So the shop and office at T A Bucks were bound together by many ties of affection and sympathy and loyalty and these bonds were strongest where at one end they touched Emma McChesney Buck and at the other faithful Sophy Kumpf
Each a triumphant example of Woman in Business
It was at this comfortable stage of Featherloom affairs that the Movement struck the T A Buck Company
Emma McChesney Buck had never mingled much in movements
Not that she lacked sympathy with them she often approved of them heart and soul
But she had been heard to say that the Movers got on her nerves
Those welldressed glib staccato ladies who spoke with such ease from platforms and whose pictures stared out at one from the womans page failed somehow to convince her
When Emma approved a new movement it was generally in spite of them never because of them
She was brazenly unapologetic when she said that she would rather listen to ten minutes of Sophy Kumpfs worldwisdom than to an hours talk by the most magnetic and silkenclad spellbinder in any cause
For fifteen business years in the office on the road and in the thriving workshop Emma McChesney had met working women galore
Women in offices women in stores women in hotelschambermaids clerks buyers waitresses actresses in road companies women demonstrators occasional traveling saleswomen women in factories scrubwomen stenographers modelsevery grade type and variety of working woman trained and untrained
She never missed a chance to talk with them
She never failed to learn from them
She had been one of them and still was
She was in the position of one who is on the inside looking out
Those other women urging this cause or that were on the outside striving to peer in
The Movement struck T A Bucks at eleven oclock Monday morning
Eleven oclock Monday morning in the middle of a busy fall season is not a propitious moment for idle chitchat
The three women who stepped out of the lift at the Buck Companys floor looked very much out of place in that hummingly busy establishment and appeared on the surface at least very chitchatty indeed
So much so that T A Buck glancing up from the cards which had preceded them had difficulty in repressing a frown of annoyance
T A Buck during his collegedays and for a lamentably long time after had been known as Beau Buck because of his faultless clothes and his charming manner
His eyes had something to do with it too no doubt
He had lived down the title by sheer force of business ability
No one thought of using the nickname now though the clothes the manner and the eyes were the same
At the entrance of the three women he had been engrossed in the difficult task of selling a fall line to Mannie Nussbaum of Portland Oregon
Mannie was what is known as a temperamental buyer
He couldnt be forced he couldnt be coaxed he couldnt be led
But when he liked a line he bought like mad never cancelled and T A Buck had just got him going
It spoke volumes for his self control that he could advance toward the waiting three his manner correct his expression bland
I am Mr Buck he said
Mrs Buck is very much engaged
I understand your visit has something to do with the girls in the shop
Im sure our manager will be able to answer any questions The eldest women raised a protesting whitegloved hand
Oh nono indeed
We must see Mrs
Buck
She spoke in the crisp decisive platformtones of one who is often addressed as Madam Chairman
Buck took a firmer grip on his selfcontrol
Im sorry Mrs Buck is in the cuttingroom
Well wait said the lady brightly
She stepped back a pace
This is Miss Susan H Croftindicating a rather sparse person of very certain yearsBut I need scarcely introduce her
Scarcely murmured Buck and wondered why
This is my daughter Miss Gladys OrtonWells
Buck found himself wondering why this slim negative creature should have such sad eyes
There came an impatient snort from Mannie Nussbaum
Buck waved a hasty hand in the direction of Emmas office
If youll wait there Ill send in to Mrs
Buck
The three turned toward Emmas bright little office
Buck scribbled a hasty word on one of the cards
Emma McChesney Buck was leaning over the great cuttingtable shears in hand
It might almost be said that she sprawled
Her eyes were very bright and her cheeks were very pink
Across the table stood a designer and two cutters and they were watching Emma with an intentness as flattering as it was sincere
They were looking not only at cloth but at an idea
Get that
asked Emma crisply and tapped the pattern spread before her with the point of her shears
That gives you the fulness without bunching dyou see
Sure assented Koritz head designer but when you get it cut youll find this piece is wasted aint it
He marked out a triangular section of cloth with one expert forefinger
No that works into the ruffle explained Emma
Here Ill cut it
Then youll see
She grasped the shears firmly in her right hand smoothed the cloth spread before her with a nervous little pat of her left pushed her bright hair back from her forehead and prepared to cut
At which critical moment there entered Annie the errandgirl with the three bits of white pasteboard
Emma glanced down at them and waved Annie away
Cant see them
Busy
Annie stood her ground
Mr Buck said youd see em
Theyre waiting
Emma picked up one of the cards
On it Buck had scribbled a single word Movers
Mrs T A Buck smiled
A little malicious gleam came into her eyes
Show em in here Annie she commanded with a wave of the huge shears
Ill teach em to interrupt me when Ive got my hands in the bluingwater
She bent over the table again measuring with her keen eye
When the three were ushered in a moment later she looked up briefly and nodded then bent over the table again
But in that brief moment she had the three marked indexed and pigeonholed
If one could have looked into that lightning mind of hers one would have found something like this Hmm
What Ida Tarbell calls Restless women
Money and always have had it
Those hats were born in one of those exclusive little shops off the Avenue
Rich but somber
They think theyre advanced but they still resent the triumph of the motorcar over the horse
That girl cant call her soul her own
Good eyes but too sad
He probably didnt suit mother
What she said was Howdydo
Were just bringing a new skirt into the world
I thought you might like to be in at the birth
How very interesting
chirped the two older women
The girl said nothing but a look of anticipation brightened her eyes
It deepened and glowed as Emma McChesney Buck bent to her task and the great jaws of the shears opened and shut on the virgin cloth
Six pairs of eyes followed the fascinating steel before which the cloth rippled and fell away as water is cleft by the prow of a stanch little boat
Around the curves went the shears guided by Emmas firm white hands snipping slashing doubling on itself a very swashbuckler of a shears
There
exclaimed Emma at last and dropped the shears on the table with a clatter
Put that together and see whether it makes a skirt or not
Now ladies
The three drew a long breath
It was the sort of sound that comes up from the crowd when a skyrocket has gone off successfully with a final shower of stars
Do you do that often
ventured Mrs OrtonWells
Often enough to keep my hand in replied Emma and led the way to her office
The three followed in silence
They were strangely silent too as they seated themselves around Emma Bucks desk
Curiously enough it was the subdued Miss OrtonWells who was the first to speak
Ill never rest she said until I see that skirt finished and actually ready to wear
She smiled at Emma
When she did that you saw that Miss OrtonWells had her charm
Emma smiled back and patted the girls hand just once
At that there came a look into Miss OrtonWells eyes and you saw that most decidedly she had her charm
Up spoke Mrs OrtonWells
Gladys is such an enthusiast
Thats really her reason for being here
Gladys is very much interested in working girls
In fact we are all as you probably know intensely interested in the working woman
Thank you
said Emma McChesney Buck
Thats very kind
We working women are very grateful to you
We
exclaimed Mrs OrtonWells and Miss Susan Croft blankly and in perfect time
Emma smiled sweetly
Surely youll admit that Im a working woman
Miss Susan H Croft was not a person to be trifled with
She elucidated acidly
We mean women who work with their hands
By what power do you think those shears were moved across the cuttingtable
We dont cut our patterns with an ouijaboard
Mrs OrtonWells rustled protestingly
But my dear Mrs Buck you know we mean women of the Laboring Class
Im in this place of business from nine to five Monday to Saturday inclusive
If that doesnt make me a member of the laboring class I dont want to belong
It was here that Mrs OrtonWells showed herself a woman not to be trifled with
She moved forward to the edge of her chair fixed Emma Buck with determined eyes and swept into midstream sails spread
Dont be frivolous Mrs Buck
We are here on a serious errand
It ought to interest you vitally because of the position you occupy in the world of business
We are launching a campaign against the extravagant ridiculous and oftentimes indecent dress of the working girl with especial reference to the girl who works in garment factories
They squander their earnings in costumes absurdly unfitted to their station in life
Our plan is to influence them in the direction of neatness modesty and economy in dress
At present each tries to outdo the other in style and variety of costume
Their shoes are highheeled clothtopped their blouses lacy and collarless their hats absurd
We propose a costume which shall be neat becoming and appropriate
Not exactly a uniform perhaps but something with a fixed idea in cut color and style
A corps of twelve young ladies belonging to our best families has been chosen to speak to the shop girls at noon meetings on the subject of good taste health and morality in womens dress
My daughter Gladys is one of them
In this way we hope to convince them that simplicity and practicality and neatness are the only proper notes in the costume of the working girl
Occupying as you do a position unique in the business world Mrs Buck we expect much from your cooperation with us in this cause
Emma McChesney Buck had been gazing at Mrs OrtonWells with an intentness as flattering as it was unfeigned
But at the close of Mrs OrtonWells speech she was strangely silent
She glanced down at her shoes
Now Emma McChesney Buck had a weakness for smart shoes which her slim wellarched foot excused
Hers were what might be called intelligentlooking feet
There was nothing thick nothing clumsy nothing awkward about them
And Emma treated them with the consideration they deserved
They were shod now in a pair of slim aristocratic and modish ties above which the grateful eye caught a flashing glimpse of blacksilk stocking
Then her eye traveled up her smartly tailored skirt up the bodice of that wellmade and becoming costume until her glance rested on her own shoulder and paused
Then she looked up at Mrs OrtonWells
The eyes of Mrs OrtonWells Miss Susan H Croft and Miss Gladys OrtonWells had by some strange power of magnetism followed the path of Emmas eyes
They finished just one second behind her so that when she raised her eyes it was to encounter theirs
I have explained retorted Mrs Orton Wells tartly in reply to nothing seemingly that our problem is with the factory girl
She represents a distinct and separate class
Emma McChesney Buck nodded I understand
Our girls are very young eighteen twenty twentytwo
At eighteen or thereabouts practical garments havent the strong appeal that you might think they have
They should have insisted Mrs OrtonWells
Maybe said Emma Buck gently
But to me it seems just as reasonable to argue that an apple tree has no right to wear pinkandwhite blossoms in the spring so long as it is going to bear sober russets in the autumn
Miss Susan H Croft rustled indignantly
Then you refuse to work with us
You will not consent to Miss OrtonWells speaking to the girls in your shop this noon
Emma looked at Gladys OrtonWells
Gladys was wearing black and black did not become her
It made her creamy skin sallow
Her suit was severely tailored and her hat was small and harshly outlined and her hair was drawn back from her face
All this in spite of the fact that Miss OrtonWells was of the limp and fragile type which demands ruffles fluffiness flowing lines and froufrou
Emmas glance at the suppressed Gladys was as fleeting as it was keen but it sufficed to bring her to a decision
She pressed a buzzer at her desk
I shall be happy to have Miss OrtonWells speak to the girls in our shop this noon and as often as she cares to speak
If she can convince the girls that aerfixed idea in cut color and style is the thing to be adopted by shopworkers I am perfectly willing that they be convinced
Then to Annie who appeared in answer to the buzzer Will you tell Sophy Kumpf to come here please
Mrs OrtonWells beamed
The somber plumes in her correct hat bobbed and dipped to Emma
The austere Miss Susan H Croft unbent in a nutcracker smile
Only Miss Gladys OrtonWells remained silent thoughtful unenthusiastic
Her eyes were on Emmas face
A heavy comfortable step sounded in the hall outside the office door
Emma turned with a smile to the stout motherly redcheeked woman who entered smoothing her coarse brown hair with workroughened fingers
Emma took one of those calloused hands in hers
Sophy we need your advice
This is Mrs Sophy KumpfMrs OrtonWells Miss Susan H CroftSophy threw her a keen glance she knew that nameand Miss OrtonWells
Of the four Sophy was the most at ease
Pleased to meet you said Sophy Kumpf
The three bowed but did not commit themselves
Emma her hand still on Sophys elaborated Sophy Kumpf has been with the T A Buck Company for thirty years
She could run this business singlehanded if she had to
She knows any machine in the shop can cut a pattern keep books run the entire plant if necessary
If theres anything about petticoats that Sophy doesnt know its because it hasnt been invented yet
Sophy was sixteen when she came to Bucks
Ive heard she was the prettiest and best dressed girl in the shop
Oh now Mrs
Buck
remonstrated Sophy
Emma tried to frown as she surveyed Sophys bright eyes her rosy cheeks her broad bosom her ample hipsall that made Sophy an object to comfort and rest the eye
Dont dispute Sophy
Sophy has educated her children married them off and welcomed their children
She thinks that excuses her for having been frivolous and extravagant at sixteen
But we know better dont we
Im using you as a horrible example Sophy
Sophy turned affably to the listening three
Dont let her string you she said and winked one knowing eye
Mrs OrtonWells stiffened
Miss Susan H Croft congealed
But Miss Gladys Orton Wells smiled
And then Emma knew she was right
Sophy whos the prettiest girl in our shop
And the best dressed
Lily Bernstein Sophy made prompt answer
Send her in to us will you
And give her credit for lost time when she comes back to the shop
Sophy with a last beamingly goodnatured smile withdrew
Five minutes later when Lily Bernstein entered the office Sophy qualified as a judge of beauty
Lily Bernstein was a tiger lilyall browns and golds and creams all graciousness and warmth and lovely curves
As she came into the room Gladys OrtonWells seemed as bloodless and pale and ineffectual as a white moth beside a gorgeous tawny butterfly
Emma presented the girl as formally as she had Sophy Kumpf
And Lily Bernstein smiled upon them and her teeth were as white and even as one knew they would be before she smiled
Lily had taken off her shopapron
Her gown was blue serge cheap in quality flawless as to cut and fit and incredibly becoming
Above it her vivid face glowed like a golden rose
Lily said Emma Miss OrtonWells is going to speak to the girls this noon
I thought you might help by telling her whatever she wants to know about the girls work and all that and by making her feel at home
Well sure said Lily and smiled again her heartwarming smile
Id love to
Miss OrtonWells went on Emma smoothly wants to speak to the girls about clothes
Lily looked again at Miss OrtonWells and she did not mean to be cruel
Then she looked quickly at Emma to detect a possible joke
But Mrs Bucks face bore no trace of a smile
Clothes
repeated Lily
And a slow red mounted to Gladys OrtonWells pale face
When Lily went out Sunday afternoons she might have passed for a millionaires daughter if she hadnt been so well dressed
Suppose you take Miss OrtonWells into the shop suggested Emma so that she may have some idea of the size and character of our family before she speaks to it
How long shall you want to speak
Miss OrtonWells started nervously stammered a little stopped
Oh ten minutes said Mrs OrtonWells graciously
Five said Gladys quickly and followed Lily Bernstein into the workroom
Mrs OrtonWells and Miss Susan H Croft gazed after them
Rather attractive that girl in a coarse way mused Mrs OrtonWells
If only we can teach them to avoid the cheap and tawdry
If only we can train them to appreciate the finer things in life
Of course their life is peculiar
Their problems are not our problems their Their problems are just exactly our problems interrupted Emma crisply
They use garlic instead of onion and they dont bathe as often as we do but then perhaps we wouldnt either if we hadnt tubs and showers so handy
In the shop queer things were happening to Gladys OrtonWells
At her entrance into the big workroom one hundred pairs of eyes had lifted dropped and in that one look condemned her hat suit blouse veil and tout ensemble
When you are on piecework you squander very little time gazing at uplift visitors in the wrong kind of clothes
Gladys OrtonWells looked about the big bright workroom
The noonday sun streamed in from a dozen great windows
There seemed somehow to be a look of content and capableness about those heads bent so busily over the stitching
It lookspleasant said Gladys OrtonWells
It aint bad
Of course its hard sitting all day
But Id rather do that than stand from eight to six behind a counter
And theres good money in it
Gladys OrtonWells turned wistful eyes on friendly little Lily Bernstein
Id like to earn money she said
Id like to work
Well why dont you
demanded Lily
Works all the style this year
Theyre all doing it
Look at the Vanderbilts and that Morgan girl and the whole crowd
These days you cant tell whether the girl at the machine next to you lives in the Bronx or on Fifth Avenue
It must be wonderful to earn your own clothes
Believe me laughed Lily Bernstein it aint so wonderful when youve had to do it all your life
She studied the pale girl before her with brows thoughtfully knit
Lily had met too many uplifters to be in awe of them
Besides a certain warmhearted friendliness was hers for every one she met
So like the child she was she spoke what was in her mind Say listen dearie
I wouldnt wear black if I was you
And that plain stuffit dont suit you
Im like that too
Theres some things I can wear and others I look fierce in
Id like you in one of them big flat hats and a full skirt like you see in the ads with lots of ribbons and tag ends and bows on it
Dyou know what I mean
My mother was a Van Cleve said Gladys drearily as though that explained everything
So it might have to any but a Lily Bernstein
Lily didnt know what a Van Cleve was but she sensed it as a drawback
Dont you care
Everybodys folks have got something the matter with em
Especially when youre a girl
But if I was you Id go right ahead and do what I wanted to
In the doorway at the far end of the shop appeared Emma with her two visitors
Mrs OrtonWells stopped and said something to a girl at a machine and her very posture and smile reeked of an offensive kindliness a condescending patronage
Gladys OrtonWells did a strange thing
She saw her mother coming toward her
She put one hand on Lily Bernsteins arm and she spoke hurriedly and in a little gasping voice
Listen
Would youwould you marry a man who hadnt any money to speak of and no sort of family if you loved him even if your mother wouldntwouldnt Would I
Say you go out tomorrow morning and buy yourself one of them floppy hats and a lace waist over fleshcolored chiffon and get married in it
Dont get it white with your coloring
Get it kind of cream
Youre so grand and thin this years things will look lovely on you
A bell shrilled somewhere in the shop
A hundred machines stopped their whirring
A hundred heads came up with a sigh of relief
Chairs were pushed back aprons unbuttoned
Emma McChesney Buck stepped forward and raised a hand for attention
The noise of a hundred tongues was stilled
Girls Miss Gladys OrtonWells is going to speak to you for five minutes on the subject of dress
Will you give her your attention please
The five minutes will be added to your noon hour
Gladys OrtonWells looked down at her hands for one terrified moment then she threw her head up bravely
There was no lack of color in her cheeks now
She stepped to the middle of the room
What I have to say wont take five minutes she said in her clear wellbred tones
You all dress so smartly and Im such a dowd I just want to ask you whether you think I ought to get blue or that new shade of gray for a travelingsuit
And the shop hardened to the eccentricities of noonday speakers made composed and ready answer Oh get blue its always good
Thank you laughed Gladys OrtonWells and was off down the hall and away with never a backward glance at her gasping and outraged mother
Emma McChesney Buck took Lily Bernsteins soft cheek between thumb and forefinger and pinched it ever so fondly
I knew youd do it Judy OGrady she said
Judy OWho
OGradya lady famous in history
Oh now quit your kiddin Mrs
Buck
said Lily Bernstein
VII AN ETUDE FOR EMMA If you listen long enough and earnestly enough and with ear sufficiently attuned to the music of this sphere there will come to you this reward The violins and oboes and cellos and brasses of humanity which seemed all at variance with each other will unite as one instrument seeming discords and dissonances will blend into harmony and the wail and blare and thrum of humanitys orchestra will sound in your ear the sublime melody of that great symphony called Life
In her sunny little private office on the twelfth floor of the great loftbuilding that housed the T A Buck Company Emma McChesney Buck sat listening to the streetsounds that were wafted to her mellowed by height and distance
The noises taken separately were the nerveracking sounds common to a busy downtown New York crossstreet
By the time they reached the little office on the twelfth floor they were softened mellowed debrutalized welded into a weird choirlike chant first high then low rising swelling dying away rising again to a dull roar with now and then vast undertones like the rumbling of a cathedral pipeorgan
Emma knew that the high clear tenor note was the shrill cry of the lame newsie at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Twentysixth Street
Those deep thunderous bass notes were the combined reverberation of nearby L trains distant subway and clanging surface cars
That sharp staccato was a motorman clanging his bell of warning
These things she knew
But she liked nevertheless to shut her eyes for a moment in the midst of her busy day and listen to the chant of the city as it came up to her subdued softened strangely beautified
The sound saddened even while it filled her with a certain exaltation
We have no one word for that sensation
The German theres a language
has itWeltschmerz
As distance softened the harsh sounds to her ears so time and experience had given her a perspective on life itself
She saw it not as a series of incidents pleasant and unpleasant but as a great universal scheme too mighty to comprehenda scheme that always worked itself out in some miraculous way
She had had a singularly full life had Emma McChesney Buck
A life replete with work leavened by sorrows sweetened with happiness
These ingredients make for tolerance
She saw for example how the capable modern staff in the main business office had forged ahead of old Pop Henderson
Pop Henderson had been head bookkeeper for years
But the pen in his trembling hand made queer spidery marks in the ledgers now and his figure seven was very likely to look like a drunken letter z
The great bulk of his work was done by the capable comely Miss Kelly who could juggle figures like a Cinquevalli
His shaking blueveined yellow hand was no match for Miss Kellys cool firm fingers
But he stayed on at Bucks and no one dreamed of insulting him with talk of a pension least of all Emma
She saw the workworn pathetic old man not only as a figure but as a symbol
Jock McChesney very young very handsome very successful coming on to New York from Chicago to be married in June found his mother wrapped in this contemplative calm
Now Emma McChesney Buck mother of an abouttobemarried son was also surprisingly young and astonishingly handsome and highly successful
Jock in a lucid moment the day before his wedding took occasion to comment rather resentfully on his mothers attitude
It seems to me he said gloomily that for a mother whose only son is about to be handed over to what the writers call the other woman youre pretty resigned not to say cheerful
Emma glanced up at him as he stood there so tall and straight and altogether good to look at and the glow of love and pride in her eyes belied the lightness of her words
I know it she said with mock seriousness and it worries me
I cant imagine why I fail to feel those pangs that mothers are supposed to suffer at this time
I ought to rend my garments and beat my breast but I cant help thinking of what a stunning girl Grace Galt is and what a brain she has and how lucky you are to get her
Any girlwith the future that girl had in the advertising fieldwholl give up four thousand a year and her independence to marry a man does it for love let me tell you
If anybody knows you better than your mother son Id hate to know who it is
And if anybody loves you more than your motherwell we neednt go into that because it would have to be hypothetical anyway
You see Jock Ive loved you so long and so well that I know your faults as well as your virtues and I love you not in spite of them but because of them
Oh I dont know interrupted Jock with some warmth Im not perfect but a fellow Perfect
Jock McChesney when I think of Graces feelings when she discovers that you never close a closet door
When I contemplate her emotions on hearing your howl at finding one seed in your orange juice at breakfast
When she learns of your secret and unholy passion for neckties that have a dash of red in em and how you have to be restrained by force from With a simulated roar of rage Jock McChesney fell upon his mother with a series of bearhugs that left her flushed panting limp but brighteyed
It was to her husband that Emma revealed the real source of her Spartan calm
The wedding was over
There had been a quiet little celebration after which Jock McChesney had gone West with his very lovely young wife
Emma had kissed her very tenderly very soberly after the brief ceremony
Mrs McChesney she had said and her voice shook ever so little Mrs Jock McChesney
And the new Mrs McChesney a most astonishingly intuitive young woman indeed had understood
T A Buck being a man puzzled over it a little
That night when Emma had reached the kimono and hairbrushing stage he ventured to speak his wonderment
Dyou know Emma you were about the calmest and most serene mother that I ever did see at a sons wedding
Of course I didnt expect you to have hysterics or anything like that
Ive always said that when it came to repose and selfcontrol you could make the German Empress look like a hoyden
But I always thought that at such times a mother viewed her new daughterinlaw as a rival that the very sight of her filled her with a jealous rage like that of a tigress whose cub is taken from her
I must say you were so smiling and urbane that I thought it was almost uncomplimentary to the young couple
You didnt even weep you unnatural woman
Emma seated before her dressingtable stopped brushing her hair and sat silent a moment looking down with unseeing eyes at the brush in her hand
I know it T A
Would you like to have me tell you why
He came over to her then and ran a tender hand down the length of her bright hair
Then he kissed the top of her head
This satisfactory performance he capped by saying I think I know why
Its because the minister hesitated a minute and looked from you to Grace and back again not knowing which was the bride
The way you looked in that dress Emma was enough to reconcile any woman to losing her entire family
T A you do say the nicest things to me
Like em Emma
Like em
You know perfectly well that you never can offend me by making me compliments like that
I not only like them I actually believe them
Thats because I mean them Emma
Now out with that reason
Emma stood up then and put her hands on his shoulders
But she was not looking at him
She was gazing past him her eyes dreamy contemplative
I dont know whether Ill be able to explain to you just how I feel about it
Ill probably make a mess of it
But Ill try
You see dear its just this way Two years agoa year ago evenI might have felt just that sensation of personal resentment and loss
But somehow lately Ive been looking at life throughhow shall I put itthrough sevenleague glasses
I used to see life in its relation to me and mine
Now I see it in terms of my relation to it
Do you get me
I was the soloist and the world my orchestral accompaniment
Lately Ive been content just to step back with the other instruments and let my little share go to make up a more perfect whole
In those years long before I met you when Jock was all I had in the world I worked and fought and saved that he might have the proper start the proper training and environment
And I did succeed in giving him those things
Well as I looked at him there today I saw him not as my son my property that was going out of my control into the hands of another woman but as a link in the great chain that I had helped to forgea link as strong and sound and perfect as I could make it
I saw him not as my boy Jock McChesney but as a unit
When I am gone I shall still live in him and he in turn will live in his children
There
Ive muddled ithavent Ias I said I would
But I think And she looked into her husbands glowing eyesNo Im sure you understand
And when I die T
A You Emma
And he held her close and then held her off to look at her through quizzical appreciative eyes
Why girl I cant imagine you doing anything so passive
In the busy year that followed anyone watching Emma McChesney Buck as she worked and played and constructed and helped others to work and play and construct would have agreed with T A Buck
She did not seem a woman who was looking at life objectively
As she went about her home in the evening or the office the workroom or the showrooms during the day adjusting this arranging that smoothing out snarls solving problems of business or household she was very much alive very vital very personal very electric
In that year there came to her many letters from Jock and Gracehappy letters all of them some with an undertone of great seriousness as is fitting when two people are readjusting their lives
Then in spring came the news of the baby
The telegram came to Emma as she sat in her office near the close of a busy day
As she read it and reread it the slip of paper became a misty yellow with vague lines of blue dancing about on it then it became a blur of nothing in particular as Emmas tears fell on it in a little shower of joy and pride and wonder at the eternal miracle
Then she dried her eyes mopped the telegram and her lace jabot impartially went across the hall and opened the door marked T A
BUCK
T A looked up from his desk smiled held out a hand
Girl or boy
Girl of course said Emma tremulously and her name is Emma McChesney
T A stood up and put an arm about his wifes shoulders
Lean on me grandma he said
Fiend
retorted Emma and reread the telegram happily
She folded it then with a pensive sigh I hope shell look like Grace
But with Jocks eyes
They were wasted in a man
At any rate she ought to be a raving tearing beauty with that father and mother
What about her grandmother when it comes to looks
Yes and think of the brain shell have Buck reminded her excitedly
Great Scott
With a grandmother who has made the T A Buck Featherloom Petticoat a household word and a mother who was the cleverest woman advertising copywriter in New York this young lady ought to be a composite Hetty Green Madame de Stael Hypatia and Emma McChesney Buck
Shell be a lady wizard of finance or a Shell be nothing of the kind Emma disputed calmly
That child will be a throwback
The third generation generally is
With a militant mother and a grandmother such as that child has shell just naturally be a clinging vine
Shell be a reversion to type
Shell be the kind wholl make eyes and wear pale blue and be crazy about new embroiderystitches
Just mark my words T
A
Buck had a brilliant idea
Why dont you pack a bag and run over to Chicago for a few days and see this marvel of the age
But Emma shook her head
Not now T A
Later
Let the delicate machinery of that new household adjust itself and begin to run smoothly and sweetly again
Anyone who might come in noweven Jocks motherwould be only an outsider
So she waited very patiently and considerately
There was much to occupy her mind that spring
Business was unexpectedly and gratifyingly good
Then too one of their pet dreams was being realized they were to have their own house in the country at Westchester
Together they had pored over the plans
It was to be a house of wide spacious verandas of fireplaces of bookshelves of great bright windows and white enamel and cheerful chintz
By the end of May it was finished furnished and complete
At which a surprising thing happened and yet not so surprising
A demon of restlessness seized Emma McChesney Buck
It had been a busy happy winter filled with work
Now that it was finished there came upon Emma and Buck that unconscious and quite natural irritation which follows a long winter spent together by two people no matter how much in harmony
Emma pulled herself up now and then horrified to find a rasping note of impatience in her voice
Buck found himself once or twice fairly caught in a little whirlpool of ill temper of his own making
These conditions they discovered almost simultaneously
And like the comrades they were they talked it over and came to a sensible understanding
Were a bit ragged and sawedged said Emma
Were getting on each others nerves
What we need is a vacation from each other
This morning I found myself on the verge of snapping at you
At you
Imagine T
A
Whereupon Buck came forward with his confession
Its a couple of late cases of spring fever
Youve been tied to this office all winter
Sove I
We need a change
Youve had too much petticoats too much husband too much cutting room and salesroom and rush orders and business generally
Too much Featherloom and not enough foolishness
He came over and put a gentle hand on his wifes shoulder a thing strictly against the rules during business hours
And Emma not only permitted it but reached over and covered his hand with her own
Youre tired and youre a wee bit nervous so gwan said T A ever so gently and kissed his wife gwan get out of here
And Emma got
She went not to the mountains or the seashore but with her face to the west
In her trunks were tiny garmentsgarments pink ribboned blueribboned things embroidered and scalloped and hemstitched and handmade and lacy
She went looking less grandmotherly than ever in her smart blue tailor suit her rakish hat her quietly correct gloves and slim shoes and softly becoming jabot
Her husband had got her a compartment had laden her down with books magazines fruit flowers candy
Five minutes before the train pulled out Emma looked about the little room and sighed even while she smiled
Youre an extravagant boy T A I look as if I were equipped for a dash to the pole instead of an eighteenhour run to Chicago
But I love you for it
I suppose I ought to be ashamed to confess how I like having a whole compartment just for myself
You see a compartment always will spell luxury to me
There were all those years on the road you know when I often considered myself in luck to get an upper on a local of a branch line that threw you around in your berth like a bean in a tin can every time the engineer stopped or started
Buck looked at his watch then stooped in farewell
Quite suddenly they did not want to part
They had grown curiously used to each other these two
Emma found herself clinging to this man with the tender eyes and Buck held her close regardless of trainschedules
Emma rushed him to the platform and watched him wideeyed as he swung off the slowly moving train
Come on along
she called almost tearfully
Buck looked up at her
At her trim erect figure at her clear youthful coloring at the brightness of her eye
If you want to get a reputation for comedy he laughed tell somebody on that train that youre going to visit your granddaughter
Jock met her at the station in Chicago and drove her home in a very dapper and glittering black runabout
Grace wanted to come down he explained as they sped along but theyre changing the babys food or something and she didnt want to leave
You know those nurses
Emma felt a curious little pang
This was her boy her baby talking about his baby and nurses
She had a sense of unreality
He turned to her with shining eyes
Thats a stunning getup Blonde
Honestly youre a wiz mother
Grace has told all her friends that youre coming and their mothers are going to call
But good Lord you look like my younger sister on the square you do
The apartment reached it seemed to Emma that she floated across the walk and up the stairs so eagerly did her heart cry out for a glimpse of this little being who was flesh of her flesh
Grace a little pale but more beautiful than ever met them at the door
Her arms went about Emmas neck
Then she stood her handsome motherinlaw off and gazed at her
You wonder
How lovely you look
Good heavens are they wearing that kind of hat in New York
And those collars
I havent seen a thing like em here
East is east and West is west and  Wheres that child
demanded Emma McChesney Buck
Wheres my baby
Shshshsh
came in a sibilant duet from Grace and Jock
Not now
Shes sleeping
We were up with her for three hours last night
It was the new food
Shes not used to it yet
But you foolish children cant I peek at her
Oh dear no
said Grace hastily
We never go into her room when shes asleep
This is your room mother dear
And just as soon as she wakes upthis is your bathyoull want to freshen up
Dear me who could have hung the babys little shirt here
The nurse I suppose
If I dont attend to every little thing Emma took off her hat and smoothed her hair with light deft fingers
She turned a smiling face toward Jock and Grace standing there in the doorway
Now dont bother dear
If you knew how I love having that little shirt to look at
And Ive such things in my trunk
Wait till you see them
So she possessed her soul in patience for one hour two hours
At the end of the second hour a little wail went up
Grace vanished down the hall
Emma her heart beating very fast followed her
A moment later she was bending over a very pink morsel with very blue eyes and she was saying over and over in a rapture of delightful idiocy Say hello to your granmuzzer yes her is
Say hello granny
And her longing arms reached down to take up her namesake
Not now
Grace said hastily
We never play with her just before feedingtime
We find that it excites her and thats bad for her digestion
Dear me
marveled Emma
I dont remember worrying about Jocks digestion when he was two and a half months old
It was thus that Emma McChesney Buck for many years accustomed to leadership learned to follow humbly and in silence
She had always been the orbit about which her world revolved
Years of brilliant success of triumphant execution had not spoiled her or made her offensively dictatorial
But they had taught her a certain selfconfidence had accustomed her to a degree of deference from others
Now she was the humblest of the satellites revolving about this sun of the household
She learned to tiptoe when small Emma McChesney was sleeping
She learned that the modern mother does not approve of the holding of a child in ones arms no matter how those arms might be aching to feel the frail weight of the soft sweet body
She who had brought a child into the world who had had to train that child alone had raised him singlehanded had educated him denied herself for him made a man of him now found herself all ignorant of twentieth century childraising methods
She learned strange things about barleywater and formulae and units and olive oil and orange juice and ounces and farina and baththermometers and blueandwhite striped nurses who view grandmothers with a coldly disapproving and pitying eye
She watched the bathingprocess for the first time with wonder as frank as it was unfeigned
And I thought I was a modern woman
she marveled
When I used to bathe Jock I tested the temperature of the water with my elbow and I know my mother used to test my bathwater when I was a baby by putting me into it
She used to say that if I turned blue she knew the water was too cold and if I turned red she knew it was too hot
Humph
snorted the blueandwhite striped nurse and rightly
Oh I dont say that your method isnt the proper one Emma hastened to say humbly and watched Grace scrutinize the baththermometer with critical eye
In the days that followed there came calling the mothers of Graces youngwomen friends as Jock had predicted
Charming elderly women most of them all of them gracious and friendly with that generous friendliness which is of the West
But each fell into one of two classesthe placid blacksilk rather vague woman of middle age whose face has the blank look of the sheltered woman and who wrinkles early from sheer lack of sufficient activity or vital interest in life and the wiry welldressed assertive type who talked about her club work and her charities her voice always taking the rising inflection at the end of a sentence as though addressing a meeting
When they met Emma it was always with a little startled look of surprise followed by something that bordered on disapproval
Emma the keenly observant watching them felt vaguely uncomfortable
She tried to be politely interested in what they had to say but she found her thoughts straying a thousand miles away to the man whom she loved and who loved her to the big busy factory with its humming machinery and its capable office staff to the tasteful comfortable spacious house that she had helped to plan to all the vital absorbing fascinating and constructive interests with which her busy New York life was filled to overflowing
So she looked smilingly at the plump grayhaired ladies who came acalling in their smart black with the softening laceeffect at the throat and they looked smiling politely too at this slim erect pinkcheeked brighteyed woman with the shining golden hair and the firm smooth skin and the alert manner and in their eyes was that distrust which lurks in the eyes of a woman as she looks at another woman of her own age who doesnt show it
In the weeks of her stay Emma managed little by little to take the place of second mother in the household
She had tact and finesse and cleverness enough even for that herculean feat
Graces pale cheeks and last years wardrobe made her firm in her stand
Grace she said one day listen to me I want you to get some clothesa lot of them and foolish ones all of them
Babies are all very well but husbands have some slight right to consideration
The clock for you is an instrument devised to cut up the day and night into your babys eating and sleepingperiods
I want you to get some floppy hats with roses on em and dresses with ruffles and sashes
Ill stay home and guard your child from vandals and ogres
Scat
Her stay lengthened to four weeks five weeks six
She had the satisfaction of seeing the roses blooming in Graces cheeks as well as in her hats
She learned to efface her own personality that others might shine who had a better right
And she lost some of her own bright color a measure of her own buoyancy
In the sixth week she saw in her mirror something that caused her to lean forward to stare for one intent moment then to shrink back wideeyed
A little sunburst hairfine but undeniable was etched delicately about the corners of her eyes
Fifteen minutes later she had wired New York thus Home Friday
Do you still love me
EMMA
When she left little Emma McChesney was sleeping by a curious coincidence as she had been when Emma arrived so that she could not have the satisfaction of a last pressure of the lips against the rosepetal cheek
She had to content herself with listening close to the door in the vain hope of catching a last sound of the childs breathing
She was laden with fruits and flowers and magazines on her departure as she had been when she left New York
But somehow these things did not seem to interest her
After the train had left Chicagos smoky buildings far behind she sat very still for a long time her eyes shut
She told herself that she felt and looked very old very tired very unlike the Emma McChesney Buck who had left New York a few weeks before
Then she thought of T A and her eyes unclosed and she smiled
By the time the train had reached Cleveland the little lines seemed miraculously to have disappeared somehow from about her eyes
When they left the One Hundred and Twentyfifth Street station she was a creature transformed
And when the train rolled into the great downtown shed Emma was herself again brighteyed alert vibrating energy
There was no searching no hesitation
Her eyes met his and his eyes found hers with a quite natural magnetism
Oh T A my dear my dear
I didnt know you were so handsome
And how beautiful New York is
Tell me Have I grown old
Have I
T A bundled her into a taxi and gazed at her in some alarm
You
Old
What put that nonsense into your head
Youre tired dear
Well go home and youll have a good rest and a quiet evening Rest
echoed Emma and sat up very straight her cheeks pink
Quiet evening
T A Buck listen to me
Ive had nothing but rest and quiet evenings for six weeks
I feel a million years old
One more day of being a grandmother and I should have died
Do you know what Im going to do
Im going to stop at Fifth Avenue this minute and buy a hat thats a thousand times too young for me and youre going with me to tell me that it isnt
And then youll take me somewhere to dinnera place with music and pink shades
And then I want to see a wicked play preferably with a runway through the center aisle for the chorus
And then I want to go somewhere and dance
Get that dear
Dance
Tell me T
Atell me the truth Do you think Im old and faded and wistful and grandmotherly
I think said T A Buck that youre the most beautiful the most wonderful the most adorable woman in the world and the more foolish your new hat is and the later we dance the better Ill like it
It has been awful without you Emma
Emma closed her eyes and there came from the depths of her heart a great sigh of relief and comfort and gratification
Oh T A my dear its all very well to drown your identity in the music of the orchestra but theres nothing equal to the soulfilling satisfaction that you get in solo work
