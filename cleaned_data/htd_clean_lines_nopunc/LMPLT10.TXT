The Lamplighter by Charles Dickens Scanned and proofed by David Price ccx074coventryacuk THE LAMPLIGHTER If you talk of Murphy and Francis Moore gentlemen said the lamplighter who was in the chair I mean to say that neither of em ever had any more to do with the stars than Tom Grig had
And what had HE to do with em
asked the lamplighter who officiated as vice
Nothing at all replied the other just exactly nothing at all
Do you mean to say you dont believe in Murphy then
demanded the lamplighter who had opened the discussion
I mean to say I believe in Tom Grig replied the chairman
Whether I believe in Murphy or not is a matter between me and my conscience and whether Murphy believes in himself or not is a matter between him and his conscience
Gentlemen I drink your healths
The lamplighter who did the company this honour was seated in the chimneycorner of a certain tavern which has been time out of mind the Lamplighters House of Call
He sat in the midst of a circle of lamplighters and was the cacique or chief of the tribe
If any of our readers have had the good fortune to behold a lamplighters funeral they will not be surprised to learn that lamplighters are a strange and primitive people that they rigidly adhere to old ceremonies and customs which have been handed down among them from father to son since the first public lamp was lighted out of doors that they intermarry and betroth their children in infancy that they enter into no plots or conspiracies for who ever heard of a traitorous lamplighter
 that they commit no crimes against the laws of their country there being no instance of a murderous or burglarious lamplighter that they are in short notwithstanding their apparently volatile and restless character a highly moral and reflective people having among themselves as many traditional observances as the Jews and being as a body if not as old as the hills at least as old as the streets
It is an article of their creed that the first faint glimmering of true civilisation shone in the first streetlight maintained at the public expense
They trace their existence and high position in the public esteem in a direct line to the heathen mythology and hold that the history of Prometheus himself is but a pleasant fable whereof the true hero is a lamplighter
Gentlemen said the lamplighter in the chair I drink your healths
And perhaps Sir said the vice holding up his glass and rising a little way off his seat and sitting down again in token that he recognised and returned the compliment perhaps you will add to that condescension by telling us who Tom Grig was and how he came to be connected in your mind with Francis Moore Physician
Hear hear hear
cried the lamplighters generally
Tom Grig gentlemen said the chairman was one of us and it happened to him as it dont often happen to a public character in our line that he had his whatyoumaycallit cast
His head
said the vice
No replied the chairman not his head
His face perhaps
said the vice
No not his face
His legs
No not his legs
Nor yet his arms nor his hands nor his feet nor his chest all of which were severally suggested
His nativity perhaps
Thats it said the chairman awakening from his thoughtful attitude at the suggestion
His nativity
Thats what Tom had cast gentlemen
In plaster
asked the vice
I dont rightly know how its done returned the chairman
But I suppose it was
And there he stopped as if that were all he had to say whereupon there arose a murmur among the company which at length resolved itself into a request conveyed through the vice that he would go on
This being exactly what the chairman wanted he mused for a little time performed that agreeable ceremony which is popularly termed wetting ones whistle and went on thus Tom Grig gentlemen was as I have said one of us and I may go further and say he was an ornament to us and such a one as only the good old times of oil and cotton could have produced
Toms family gentlemen were all lamplighters
Not the ladies I hope
asked the vice
They had talent enough for it Sir rejoined the chairman and would have been but for the prejudices of society
Let women have their rights Sir and the females of Toms family would have been every one of em in office
But that emancipation hasnt come yet and hadnt then and consequently they confined themselves to the bosoms of their families cooked the dinners mended the clothes minded the children comforted their husbands and attended to the housekeeping generally
Its a hard thing upon the women gentlemen that they are limited to such a sphere of action as this very hard
I happen to know all about Tom gentlemen from the circumstance of his uncle by his mothers side having been my particular friend
His thats Toms uncles fate was a melancholy one
Gas was the death of him
When it was first talked of he laughed
He wasnt angry he laughed at the credulity of human nature
They might as well talk he says of laying on an everlasting succession of glowworms and then he laughed again partly at his joke and partly at poor humanity
In course of time however the thing got ground the experiment was made and they lighted up Pall Mall
Toms uncle went to see it
Ive heard that he fell off his ladder fourteen times that night from weakness and that he would certainly have gone on falling till he killed himself if his last tumble hadnt been into a wheelbarrow which was going his way and humanely took him home
I foresee in this says Toms uncle faintly and taking to his bed as he spoke  I foresee in this he says the breaking up of our profession
Theres no more going the rounds to trim by daylight no more dribbling down of the oil on the hats and bonnets of ladies and gentlemen when one feels in spirits
Any low fellow can light a gaslamp
And its all up
In this state of mind he petitioned the government for  I want a word again gentlemen  what do you call that which they give to people when its found out at last that theyve never been of any use and have been paid too much for doing nothing
Compensation
suggested the vice
Thats it said the chairman
Compensation
They didnt give it him though and then he got very fond of his country all at once and went about saying that gas was a deathblow to his native land and that it was a plot of the radicals to ruin the country and destroy the oil and cotton trade for ever and that the whales would go and kill themselves privately out of sheer spite and vexation at not being caught
At last he got rightdown cracked called his tobaccopipe a gaspipe thought his tears were lamp oil and went on with all manner of nonsense of that sort till one night he hung himself on a lampiron in Saint Martins Lane and there was an end of HIM
Tom loved him gentlemen but he survived it
He shed a tear over his grave got very drunk spoke a funeral oration that night in the watchhouse and was fined five shillings for it in the morning
Some men are none the worse for this sort of thing
Tom was one of em
He went that very afternoon on a new beat as clear in his head and as free from fever as Father Mathew himself
Toms new beat gentlemen was  I cant exactly say where for that hed never tell but I know it was in a quiet part of town where there were some queer old houses
I have always had it in my head that it must have been somewhere near Canonbury Tower in Islington but thats a matter of opinion
Wherever it was he went upon it with a brannew ladder a white hat a brown holland jacket and trousers a blue neckkerchief and a sprig of full blown double wallflower in his buttonhole
Tom was always genteel in his appearance and I have heard from the best judges that if he had left his ladder at home that afternoon you might have took him for a lord
He was always merry was Tom and such a singer that if there was any encouragement for native talent hed have been at the opera
He was on his ladder lighting his first lamp and singing to himself in a manner more easily to be conceived than described when he hears the clock strike five and suddenly sees an old gentleman with a telescope in his hand throw up a window and look at him very hard
Tom didnt know what could be passing in this old gentlemans mind
He thought it likely enough that he might be saying within himself Heres a new lamplighter  a goodlooking young fellow  shall I stand something to drink
Thinking this possible he keeps quite still pretending to be very particular about the wick and looks at the old gentleman sideways seeming to take no notice of him
Gentlemen he was one of the strangest and most mysteriouslooking files that ever Tom clapped his eyes on
He was dressed all slovenly and untidy in a great gown of a kind of bedfurniture pattern with a cap of the same on his head and a long old flapped waistcoat with no braces no strings very few buttons  in short with hardly any of those artificial contrivances that hold society together
Tom knew by these signs and by his not being shaved and by his not being overclean and by a sort of wisdom not quite awake in his face that he was a scientific old gentleman
He often told me that if he could have conceived the possibility of the whole Royal Society being boiled down into one man he should have said the old gentlemans body was that Body
The old gentleman claps the telescope to his eye looks all round sees nobody else in sight stares at Tom again and cries out very loud Halloa
Halloa Sir says Tom from the ladder and halloa again if you come to that
Heres an extraordinary fulfilment says the old gentleman of a prediction of the planets
Is there
says Tom
Im very glad to hear it
Young man says the old gentleman you dont know me
Sir says Tom I have not that honour but I shall be happy to drink your health notwithstanding
I read cries the old gentleman without taking any notice of this politeness on Toms part  I read whats going to happen in the stars
Tom thanked him for the information and begged to know if anything particular was going to happen in the stars in the course of a week or so but the old gentleman correcting him explained that he read in the stars what was going to happen on dry land and that he was acquainted with all the celestial bodies
I hope theyre all well Sir says Tom  everybody
Hush
cries the old gentleman
I have consulted the book of Fate with rare and wonderful success
I am versed in the great sciences of astrology and astronomy
In my house here I have every description of apparatus for observing the course and motion of the planets
Six months ago I derived from this source the knowledge that precisely as the clock struck five this afternoon a stranger would present himself  the destined husband of my young and lovely niece  in reality of illustrious and high descent but whose birth would be enveloped in uncertainty and mystery
Dont tell me yours isnt says the old gentleman who was in such a hurry to speak that he couldnt get the words out fast enough for I know better
Gentlemen Tom was so astonished when he heard him say this that he could hardly keep his footing on the ladder and found it necessary to hold on by the lamppost
There WAS a mystery about his birth
His mother had always admitted it
Tom had never known who was his father and some people had gone so far as to say that even SHE was in doubt
While he was in this state of amazement the old gentleman leaves the window bursts out of the housedoor shakes the ladder and Tom like a ripe pumpkin comes sliding down into his arms
Let me embrace you he says folding his arms about him and nearly lighting up his old bedfurniture gown at Toms link
Youre a man of noble aspect
Everything combines to prove the accuracy of my observations
You have had mysterious promptings within you he says I know you have had whisperings of greatness eh
he says
I think I have says Tom  Tom was one of those who can persuade themselves to anything they like  Ive often thought I wasnt the small beer I was taken for
You were right cries the old gentleman hugging him again
Come in
My niece awaits us
Is the young lady tolerable goodlooking Sir
says Tom hanging fire rather as he thought of her playing the piano and knowing French and being up to all manner of accomplishments
Shes beautiful
cries the old gentleman who was in such a terrible bustle that he was all in a perspiration
She has a graceful carriage an exquisite shape a sweet voice a countenance beaming with animation and expression and the eye he says rubbing his hands of a startled fawn
Tom supposed this might mean what was called among his circle of acquaintance a game eye and with a view to this defect inquired whether the young lady had any cash
She has five thousand pounds cries the old gentleman
But what of that
what of that
A word in your ear
Im in search of the philosophers stone
I have very nearly found it  not quite
It turns everything to gold thats its property
Tom naturally thought it must have a deal of property and said that when the old gentleman did get it he hoped hed be careful to keep it in the family
Certainly he says of course
Five thousand pounds
Whats five thousand pounds to us
Whats five million
he says
Whats five thousand million
Money will be nothing to us
We shall never be able to spend it fast enough
Well try what we can do Sir says Tom
We will says the old gentleman
Your name
Grig says Tom
The old gentleman embraced him again very tight and without speaking another word dragged him into the house in such an excited manner that it was as much as Tom could do to take his link and ladder with him and put them down in the passage
Gentlemen if Tom hadnt been always remarkable for his love of truth I think you would still have believed him when he said that all this was like a dream
There is no better way for a man to find out whether he is really asleep or awake than calling for something to eat
If hes in a dream gentlemen hell find something wanting in flavour depend upon it
Tom explained his doubts to the old gentleman and said that if there was any cold meat in the house it would ease his mind very much to test himself at once
The old gentleman ordered up a venison pie a small ham and a bottle of very old Madeira
At the first mouthful of pie and the first glass of wine Tom smacks his lips and cries out Im awake  wide awake and to prove that he was so gentlemen he made an end of em both
When Tom had finished his meal which he never spoke of afterwards without tears in his eyes the old gentleman hugs him again and says Noble stranger
let us visit my young and lovely niece
Tom who was a little elevated with the wine replies The noble stranger is agreeable
At which words the old gentleman took him by the hand and led him to the parlour crying as he opened the door Here is Mr Grig the favourite of the planets
I will not attempt a description of female beauty gentlemen for every one of us has a model of his own that suits his own taste best
In this parlour that Im speaking of there were two young ladies and if every gentleman present will imagine two models of his own in their places and will be kind enough to polish em up to the very highest pitch of perfection he will then have a faint conception of their uncommon radiance
Besides these two young ladies there was their waitingwoman that under any other circumstances Tom would have looked upon as a Venus and besides her there was a tall thin dismalfaced young gentleman half man and half boy dressed in a childish suit of clothes very much too short in the legs and arms and looking according to Toms comparison like one of the wax juveniles from a tailors door grown up and run to seed
Now this youngster stamped his foot upon the ground and looked very fierce at Tom and Tom looked fierce at him  for to tell the truth gentlemen Tom more than half suspected that when they entered the room he was kissing one of the young ladies and for anything Tom knew you observe it might be HIS young lady  which was not pleasant
Sir says Tom before we proceed any further will you have the goodness to inform me who this young Salamander  Tom called him that for aggravation you perceive gentlemen  who this young Salamander may be
That Mr Grig says the old gentleman is my little boy
He was christened Galileo Isaac Newton Flamstead
Dont mind him
Hes a mere child
And a very fine child too says Tom  still aggravating youll observe  of his age and as good as fine I have no doubt
How do you do my man
with which kind and patronising expressions Tom reached up to pat him on the head and quoted two lines about little boys from Doctor Wattss Hymns which he had learnt at a Sunday School
It was very easy to see gentlemen by this youngsters frowning and by the waitingmaids tossing her head and turning up her nose and by the young ladies turning their backs and talking together at the other end of the room that nobody but the old gentleman took very kindly to the noble stranger
Indeed Tom plainly heard the waitingwoman say of her master that so far from being able to read the stars as he pretended she didnt believe he knew his letters in em or at best that he had got further than words in one syllable but Tom not minding this for he was in spirits after the Madeira looks with an agreeable air towards the young ladies and kissing his hand to both says to the old gentleman Which is which
This says the old gentleman leading out the handsomest if one of em could possibly be said to be handsomer than the other  this is my niece Miss Fanny Barker
If youll permit me Miss says Tom being a noble stranger and a favourite of the planets I will conduct myself as such
With these words he kisses the young lady in a very affable way turns to the old gentleman slaps him on the back and says Whens it to come off my buck
The young lady coloured so deep and her lip trembled so much gentlemen that Tom really thought she was going to cry
But she kept her feelings down and turning to the old gentleman says Dear uncle though you have the absolute disposal of my hand and fortune and though you mean well in disposing of em thus I ask you whether you dont think this is a mistake
Dont you think dear uncle she says that the stars must be in error
Is it not possible that the comet may have put em out
The stars says the old gentleman couldnt make a mistake if they tried
Emma he says to the other young lady
Yes papa says she
The same day that makes your cousin Mrs Grig will unite you to the gifted Mooney
No remonstrance  no tears
Now Mr Grig let me conduct you to that hallowed ground that philosophical retreat where my friend and partner the gifted Mooney of whom I have just now spoken is even now pursuing those discoveries which shall enrich us with the precious metal and make us masters of the world
Come Mr Grig he says
With all my heart Sir replies Tom and luck to the gifted Mooney say I  not so much on his account as for our worthy selves
With this sentiment Tom kissed his hand to the ladies again and followed him out having the gratification to perceive as he looked back that they were all hanging on by the arms and legs of Galileo Isaac Newton Flamstead to prevent him from following the noble stranger and tearing him to pieces
Gentlemen Toms fatherinlaw that was to be took him by the hand and having lighted a little lamp led him across a paved courtyard at the back of the house into a very large dark gloomy room filled with all manner of bottles globes books telescopes crocodiles alligators and other scientific instruments of every kind
In the centre of this room was a stove or furnace with what Tom called a pot but which in my opinion was a crucible in full boil
In one corner was a sort of ladder leading through the roof and up this ladder the old gentleman pointed as he said in a whisper The observatory
Mr Mooney is even now watching for the precise time at which we are to come into all the riches of the earth
It will be necessary for he and I alone in that silent place to cast your nativity before the hour arrives
Put the day and minute of your birth on this piece of paper and leave the rest to me
You dont mean to say says Tom doing as he was told and giving him back the paper that Im to wait here long do you
Its a precious dismal place
Hush
says the old gentleman
Its hallowed ground
Farewell
Stop a minute says Tom
What a hurry youre in
Whats in that large bottle yonder
Its a child with three heads says the old gentleman and everything else in proportion
Why dont you throw him away
says Tom
What do you keep such unpleasant things here for
Throw him away
cries the old gentleman
We use him constantly in astrology
Hes a charm
I shouldnt have thought it says Tom from his appearance
MUST you go I say
The old gentleman makes him no answer but climbs up the ladder in a greater bustle than ever
Tom looked after his legs till there was nothing of him left and then sat down to wait feeling so he used to say as comfortable as if he was going to be made a freemason and they were heating the pokers
Tom waited so long gentlemen that he began to think it must be getting on for midnight at least and felt more dismal and lonely than ever he had done in all his life
He tried every means of whiling away the time but it never had seemed to move so slow
First he took a nearer view of the child with three heads and thought what a comfort it must have been to his parents
Then he looked up a long telescope which was pointed out of the window but saw nothing particular in consequence of the stopper being on at the other end
Then he came to a skeleton in a glass case labelled Skeleton of a Gentleman  prepared by Mr Mooney  which made him hope that Mr Mooney might not be in the habit of preparing gentlemen that way without their own consent
A hundred times at least he looked into the pot where they were boiling the philosophers stone down to the proper consistency and wondered whether it was nearly done
When it is thinks Tom Ill send out for sixpennorth of sprats and turn em into gold fish for a first experiment
Besides which he made up his mind gentlemen to have a countryhouse and a park and to plant a bit of it with a double row of gaslamps a mile long and go out every night with a Frenchpolished mahogany ladder and two servants in livery behind him to light em for his own pleasure
At length and at last the old gentlemans legs appeared upon the steps leading through the roof and he came slowly down bringing along with him the gifted Mooney
This Mooney gentlemen was even more scientific in appearance than his friend and had as Tom often declared upon his word and honour the dirtiest face we can possibly know of in this imperfect state of existence
Gentlemen you are all aware that if a scientific man isnt absent in his mind hes of no good at all
Mr Mooney was so absent that when the old gentleman said to him Shake hands with Mr Grig he put out his leg
Heres a mind Mr
Grig
cries the old gentleman in a rapture
Heres philosophy
Heres rumination
Dont disturb him he says for this is amazing
Tom had no wish to disturb him having nothing particular to say but he was so uncommonly amazing that the old gentleman got impatient and determined to give him an electric shock to bring him to  for you must know Mr Grig he says that we always keep a strongly charged battery ready for that purpose
These means being resorted to gentlemen the gifted Mooney revived with a loud roar and he no sooner came to himself than both he and the old gentleman looked at Tom with compassion and shed tears abundantly
My dear friend says the old gentleman to the Gifted prepare him
I say cries Tom falling back none of that you know
No preparing by Mr Mooney if you please
Alas
replies the old gentleman you dont understand us
My friend inform him of his fate
 I cant
The Gifted mustered up his voice after many efforts and informed Tom that his nativity had been carefully cast and he would expire at exactly thirtyfive minutes twentyseven seconds and five sixths of a second past nine oclock am on that day two months
Gentlemen I leave you to judge what were Toms feelings at this announcement on the eve of matrimony and endless riches
I think he says in a trembling voice there must be a mistake in the working of that sum
Will you do me the favour to cast it up again
 There is no mistake replies the old gentleman it is confirmed by Francis Moore Physician
Here is the prediction for tomorrow two months
And he showed him the page where sure enough were these words  The decease of a great person may be looked for about this time
Which says the old gentleman is clearly you Mr
Grig
Too clearly cries Tom sinking into a chair and giving one hand to the old gentleman and one to the Gifted
The orb of day has set on Thomas Grig for ever
At this affecting remark the Gifted shed tears again and the other two mingled their tears with his in a kind  if I may use the expression  of Mooney and Cos entire
But the old gentleman recovering first observed that this was only a reason for hastening the marriage in order that Toms distinguished race might be transmitted to posterity and requesting the Gifted to console Mr Grig during his temporary absence he withdrew to settle the preliminaries with his niece immediately
And now gentlemen a very extraordinary and remarkable occurrence took place for as Tom sat in a melancholy way in one chair and the Gifted sat in a melancholy way in another a couple of doors were thrown violently open the two young ladies rushed in and one knelt down in a loving attitude at Toms feet and the other at the Gifteds
So far perhaps as Tom was concerned  as he used to say  you will say there was nothing strange in this but you will be of a different opinion when you understand that Toms young lady was kneeling to the Gifted and the Gifteds young lady was kneeling to Tom
Halloa
stop a minute
cries Tom heres a mistake
I need condoling with by sympathising woman under my afflicting circumstances but were out in the figure
Change partners Mooney
Monster
cries Toms young lady clinging to the Gifted
Miss
says Tom
Is THAT your manners
I abjure thee
cries Toms young lady
I renounce thee
I never will be thine
Thou she says to the Gifted art the object of my first and allengrossing passion
Wrapt in thy sublime visions thou hast not perceived my love but driven to despair I now shake off the woman and avow it
Oh cruel cruel man
With which reproach she laid her head upon the Gifteds breast and put her arms about him in the tenderest manner possible gentlemen
And I says the other young lady in a sort of ecstasy that made Tom start  I hereby abjure my chosen husband too
Hear me Goblin
 this was to the Gifted  Hear me
I hold thee in the deepest detestation
The maddening interview of this one night has filled my soul with love  but not for thee
It is for thee for thee young man she cries to Tom
As Monk Lewis finely observes Thomas Thomas I am thine Thomas Thomas thou art mine thine for ever mine for ever
with which words she became very tender likewise
Tom and the Gifted gentlemen as you may believe looked at each other in a very awkward manner and with thoughts not at all complimentary to the two young ladies
As to the Gifted I have heard Tom say often that he was certain he was in a fit and had it inwardly
Speak to me
Oh speak to me
cries Toms young lady to the Gifted
I dont want to speak to anybody he says finding his voice at last and trying to push her away
I think I had better go
Im  Im frightened he says looking about as if he had lost something
Not one look of love
she cries
Hear me while I declare   I dont know how to look a look of love he says all in a maze
Dont declare anything
I dont want to hear anybody
Thats right
cries the old gentleman who it seems had been listening
Thats right
Dont hear her
Emma shall marry you tomorrow my friend whether she likes it or not and SHE shall marry Mr
Grig
Gentlemen these words were no sooner out of his mouth than Galileo Isaac Newton Flamstead who it seems had been listening too darts in and spinning round and round like a young giants top cries Let her
Let her
Im fierce Im furious
I give her leave
Ill never marry anybody after this  never
It isnt safe
She is the falsest of the false he cries tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth and Ill live and die a bachelor
The little boy observed the Gifted gravely albeit of tender years has spoken wisdom
I have been led to the contemplation of womankind and will not adventure on the troubled waters of matrimony
What
says the old gentleman not marry my daughter
Wont you Mooney
Not if I make her
Wont you
Wont you
No says Mooney I wont
And if anybody asks me any more Ill run away and never come back again
Mr Grig says the old gentleman the stars must be obeyed
You have not changed your mind because of a little girlish folly  eh Mr
Grig
Tom gentlemen had had his eyes about him and was pretty sure that all this was a device and trick of the waitingmaid to put him off his inclination
He had seen her hiding and skipping about the two doors and had observed that a very little whispering from her pacified the Salamander directly
So thinks Tom this is a plot  but it wont fit
Eh Mr
Grig
says the old gentleman
Why Sir says Tom pointing to the crucible if the soups nearly ready   Another hour beholds the consummation of our labours returned the old gentleman
Very good says Tom with a mournful air
Its only for two months but I may as well be the richest man in the world even for that time
Im not particular Ill take her Sir
Ill take her
The old gentleman was in a rapture to find Tom still in the same mind and drawing the young lady towards him by little and little was joining their hands by main force when all of a sudden gentlemen the crucible blows up with a great crash everybody screams the room is filled with smoke and Tom not knowing what may happen next throws himself into a Fancy attitude and says Come on if youre a man
without addressing himself to anybody in particular
The labours of fifteen years
says the old gentleman clasping his hands and looking down upon the Gifted who was saving the pieces are destroyed in an instant
 And I am told gentlemen bythebye that this same philosophers stone would have been discovered a hundred times at least to speak within bounds if it wasnt for the one unfortunate circumstance that the apparatus always blows up when its on the very point of succeeding
Tom turns pale when he hears the old gentleman expressing himself to this unpleasant effect and stammers out that if its quite agreeable to all parties he would like to know exactly what has happened and what change has really taken place in the prospects of that company
We have failed for the present Mr Grig says the old gentleman wiping his forehead
And I regret it the more because I have in fact invested my nieces five thousand pounds in this glorious speculation
But dont be cast down he says anxiously  in another fifteen years Mr Grig   Oh
cries Tom letting the young ladys hand fall
Were the stars very positive about this union Sir
They were says the old gentleman
Im sorry to hear it Tom makes answer for its no go Sir
No what
cries the old gentleman
Go Sir says Tom fiercely
I forbid the banns
And with these words  which are the very words he used  he sat himself down in a chair and laying his head upon the table thought with a secret grief of what was to come to pass on that day two months
Tom always said gentlemen that that waitingmaid was the artfullest minx he had ever seen and he left it in writing in this country when he went to colonize abroad that he was certain in his own mind she and the Salamander had blown up the philosophers stone on purpose and to cut him out of his property
I believe Tom was in the right gentlemen but whether or no she comes forward at this point and says May I speak Sir
and the old gentleman answering Yes you may she goes on to say that the stars are no doubt quite right in every respect but Tom is not the man
And she says Dont you remember Sir that when the clock struck five this afternoon you gave Master Galileo a rap on the head with your telescope and told him to get out of the way
Yes I do says the old gentleman
Then says the waiting maid I say hes the man and the prophecy is fulfilled
The old gentleman staggers at this as if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest and cries He
why hes a boy
Upon that gentlemen the Salamander cries out that hell be twentyone next Ladyday and complains that his father has always been so busy with the sun round which the earth revolves that he has never taken any notice of the son that revolves round him and that he hasnt had a new suit of clothes since he was fourteen and that he wasnt even taken out of nankeen frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in em and touches on a good many more family matters to the same purpose
To make short of a long story gentlemen they all talk together and cry together and remind the old gentleman that as to the noble family his own grandfather would have been lord mayor if he hadnt died at a dinner the year before and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the cousins are married the prediction comes true every way
At last the old gentleman being quite convinced gives in and joins their hands and leaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes and they are all well pleased and the Gifted as well as any of them
In the middle of this little family party gentlemen sits Tom all the while as miserable as you like
But when everything else is arranged the old gentlemans daughter says that their strange conduct was a little device of the waitingmaids to disgust the lovers he had chosen for em and will he forgive her
and if he will perhaps he might even find her a husband  and when she says that she looks uncommon hard at Tom
Then the waitingmaid says that oh dear
she couldnt abear Mr Grig should think she wanted him to marry her and that she had even gone so far as to refuse the last lamplighter who was now a literary character having set up as a billsticker and that she hoped Mr Grig would not suppose she was on her last legs by any means for the baker was very strong in his attentions at that moment and as to the butcher he was frantic
And I dont know how much more she might have said gentlemen for as you know this kind of young women are rare ones to talk if the old gentleman hadnt cut in suddenly and asked Tom if hed have her with ten pounds to recompense him for his loss of time and disappointment and as a kind of bribe to keep the story secret
It dont much matter Sir says Tom I aint long for this world
Eight weeks of marriage especially with this young woman might reconcile me to my fate
I think he says I could go off easy after that
With which he embraces her with a very dismal face and groans in a way that might move a heart of stone  even of philosophers stone
Egad says the old gentleman that reminds me  this bustle put it out of my head  there was a figure wrong
Hell live to a green old age  eightyseven at least
How much Sir
cries Tom
Eightyseven
says the old gentleman
Without another word Tom flings himself on the old gentlemans neck throws up his hat cuts a caper defies the waitingmaid and refers her to the butcher
You wont marry her
says the old gentleman angrily
And live after it
says Tom
Id sooner marry a mermaid with a smalltooth comb and lookingglass
Then take the consequences says the other
With those words  I beg your kind attention here gentlemen for its worth your notice  the old gentleman wetted the forefinger of his right hand in some of the liquor from the crucible that was spilt on the floor and drew a small triangle on Toms forehead
The room swam before his eyes and he found himself in the watch house
Found himself WHERE
cried the vice on behalf of the company generally
In the watchhouse said the chairman
It was late at night and he found himself in the very watchhouse from which he had been let out that morning
Did he go home
asked the vice
The watchhouse people rather objected to that said the chairman so he stopped there that night and went before the magistrate in the morning
Why youre here again are you
says the magistrate adding insult to injury well trouble you for five shillings more if you can conveniently spare the money
Tom told him he had been enchanted but it was of no use
He told the contractors the same but they wouldnt believe him
It was very hard upon him gentlemen as he often said for was it likely hed go and invent such a tale
They shook their heads and told him hed say anything but his prayers  as indeed he would theres no doubt about that
It was the only imputation on his moral character that ever I heard of
