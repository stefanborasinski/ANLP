MORAN OF THE LADY LETTY by Frank Norris DEDICATED TO Captain Joseph Hodgson UNITED STATES LIFE SAVING SERVICE I SHANGHAIED This is to be a story of a battle at least one murder and several sudden deaths
For that reason it begins with a pink tea and among the mingled odors of many delicate perfumes and the hale frank smell of Caroline Testout roses
There had been a great number of debutantes coming out that season in San Francisco by means of afternoon teas pink lavender and otherwise
This particular tea was intended to celebrate the fact that Josie Herrick had arrived at that time of her life when she was to wear her hair high and her gowns long and to have a day of her own quite distinct from that of her mother
Ross Wilbur presented himself at the Herrick house on Pacific Avenue much too early upon the afternoon of Miss Herricks tea
As he made his way up the canvased stairs he was aware of a terrifying array of millinery and a disquieting staccato chatter of feminine voices in the parlors and receptionrooms on either side of the hallway
A single high hat in the room that had been set apart for the mens use confirmed him in his suspicions
Might have known it would be a hen party till six anyhow he muttered swinging out of his overcoat
Bet I dont know one girl in twenty down there nowall mammas friends at this hour and papas maiden sisters and Jos schoolteachers and governesses and musicteachers and I dont know what all
When he went down he found it precisely as he expected
He went up to Miss Herrick where she stood receiving with her mother and two of the other girls and allowed them to chaff him on his forlornness
Maybe I seem at my ease said Ross Wilbur to them but really I am very much frightened
Im going to run away as soon as it is decently possible even before unless you feed me
I believe you had luncheon not two hours ago said Miss Herrick
Come along though and Ill give you some chocolate and perhaps if youre good a stuffed olive
I got them just because I knew you liked them
I ought to stay here and receive so I cant look after you for long
The two fought their way through the crowded rooms to the luncheontable and Miss Herrick got Wilbur his chocolate and his stuffed olives
They sat down and talked in a window recess for a moment Wilbur toeingin in absurd fashion as he tried to make a lap for his plate
I thought said Miss Herrick that you were going on the Ridgeways yachting party this afternoon
Mrs Ridgeway said she was counting on you
They are going out with the Petrel
She didnt count above a hundred though answered Wilbur
I got your bid first so I regretted the yachting party and I guess Id have regretted it anyhow and he grinned at her over his cup
Nice man she saidadding on the instant I must go now Ross
Wait till I eat the sugar out of my cup complained Wilbur
Tell me he added scraping vigorously at the bottom of the cup with the inadequate spoon tell me youre going to the hoedown tonight
If you mean the Assembly yes I am
Will you give me the first and last
Ill give you the first and you can ask for the last then
Lets put it down I know youll forget it
Wilbur drew a couple of cards from his case
Programmes are not good form any more said Miss Herrick
Forgetting a dance is worse
He made out the cards writing on the one he kept for himself First waltzJo
I must go back now said Miss Herrick getting up
In that case I shall runIm afraid of girls
Its a pity about you
I am one girl I dont say but girl in the aggregate like this and he pointed his chin toward the thronged parlors
It unmans me
Goodby then
Goodby until tonight about
About nine
About nine then
Ross Wilbur made his adieu to Mrs Herrick and the girls who were receiving and took himself away
As he came out of the house and stood for a moment on the steps settling his hat gingerly upon his hair so as not to disturb the parting he was not by any means an illlooking chap
His good height was helped out by his long coat and his high silk hat and there was plenty of jaw in the lower part of his face
Nor was his tailor altogether answerable for his shoulders
Three years before this time Ross Wilbur had pulled at No
5 in his varsity boat in an Eastern college that was not accustomed to athletic discomfiture
I wonder what Im going to do with myself until supper time he muttered as he came down the steps feeling for the middle of his stick
He found no immediate answer to his question
But the afternoon was fine and he set off to walk in the direction of the town with a halfformed idea of looking in at his club
At his club he found a letter in his box from his particular chum who had been spending the month shooting elk in Oregon
Dear Old Man it said will be back on the afternoon you receive this
Will hit the town on the three oclock boat
Get seats for the best show goingmy treatand arrange to assimilate nutriment at the Poodle Dogalso mine
Ive got miles of talk in me that Ive got to reel off before midnight
Yours
JERRY
Ive got a stand of horns for you Ross that are Glory Hallelujah
Well I cant go murmured Wilbur as he remembered the Assembly that was to come off that night and his engaged dance with Jo Herrick
He decided that it would be best to meet Jerry as he came off the boat and tell him how matters stood
Then he resolved since no one that he knew was in the club and the instalment of the Paris weeklies had not arrived that it would be amusing to go down to the waterfront and loaf among the shipping until it was time for Jerrys boat
Wilbur spent an hour along the wharves watching the great grain ships consigned to Cork for orders slowly gorging themselves with whole harvests of wheat from the San Joaquin Valley lumber vessels for Durban and South African ports settling lower and lower to the waters level as forests of pine and redwood stratified themselves along their decks and in their holds coal barges discharging from Nanaimo busy little tugs coughing and nuzzling at the flanks of the deepsea tramps while hay barges and Italian whitehalls came and went at every turn
A Stockton River boat went by her stern wheel churning along behind like a huge netreel a tiny maelstrom of activity centred about an Alaska Commercial Companys steamboat that would clear for Dawson in the morning
No quarter of one of the most picturesque cities in the world had more interest for Wilbur than the waterfront
In the mile or so of shipping that stretched from the docks where the China steamships landed down past the ferry slips and on to Meiggss Wharf every maritime nation in the world was represented
More than once Wilbur had talked to the loungers of the wharves stevedores out of work sailors between voyages caulkers and ship chandlers men lookingnot too earnestlyfor jobs so that on this occasion when a little undersized fellow in dirty brown sweater and clothes of Barbary coast cut asked him for a match to light his pipe Wilbur offered a cigar and passed the time of day with him
Wilbur had not forgotten that he himself was dressed for an afternoon function
But the incongruity of the business was precisely what most amused him
After a time the fellow suggested drinks
Wilbur hesitated for a moment
It would be something to tell about however so All right Ill drink with you he said
The brown sweater led the way to a sailors boardinghouse hard by
The rear of the place was built upon piles over the water
But in front on the ground floor was a barroom
Rum an gum announced the brown sweater as the two came in and took their places at the bar
Rum an gum Tuck wattle you have sir
OhI dont know hesitated Wilbur give me a mild Manhattan
While the drinks were being mixed the brown sweater called Wilburs attention to a fighting headdress from the Marquesas that was hung on the wall over the freelunch counter and opposite the bar
Wilbur turned about to look at it and remained so his back to the barkeeper till the latter told them their drinks were ready
Well mate heres big blocks an taut hawsepipes said the brown sweater cordially
Your very good health returned Wilbur
The brown sweater wiped a thin mustache in the hollow of his palm and wiped that palm upon his trouser leg
Yessir he continued once more facing the Marquesas headdress
Yessir theyre queer game down there
In the Marquesas Islands you mean
said Wilbur
Yessir theyre queer game
When they aint tattoin theirselves with Scripture texs they git from the missionaries theyre pullin out the hairs all over their bodies with two clamshells
Hair by hair y understan
Pulln out er hair
said Wilbur wondering what was the matter with his tongue
They think its cleverthink the women folk like it
Wilbur had fancied that the little man had worn a brown sweater when they first met
But now strangely enough he was not in the least surprised to see it iridescent like a pigeons breast
Y ever been down that way
inquired the little man next
Wilbur heard the words distinctly enough but somehow they refused to fit into the right places in his brain
He pulled himself together frowning heavily
Whatdidyousay
he asked with great deliberation biting off his words
Then he noticed that he and his companion were no longer in the barroom but in a little room back of it
His personality divided itself
There was one Ross Wilburwho could not make his hands go where he wanted them who said one word when he thought another and whose legs below the knee were made of solid lead
Then there was another Ross WilburRoss Wilbur the alert who was perfectly clearheaded and who stood off to one side and watched his twin brother making a monkey of himself without power and without even the desire of helping him
This latter Wilbur heard the iridescent sweater say Bust me if y ant squiffy old man
Stand by a bit an well have a ball
Cant have gotreturnexceptionallyand the round tablepull out hairs wi tu clamshls gabbled Wilburs stupefied double and Wilbur the alert said to himself Youre not drunk Ross Wilbur thats certain what could they have put in your cocktail
The iridescent sweater stamped twice upon the floor and a trap door fell away beneath Wilburs feet like the drop of a gallows
With the eyes of his undrugged self Wilbur had a glimpse of water below
His elbow struck the floor as he went down and he fell feet first into a Whitehall boat
He had time to observe two men at the oars and to look between the piles that supported the house above him and catch a glimpse of the bay and a glint of the Contra Costa shore
He was not in the least surprised at what had happened and made up his mind that it would be a good idea to lie down in the boat and go to sleep
Suddenlybut how long after his advent into the boat he could not tellhis wits began to return and settle themselves like wild birds flocking again after a scare
Swiftly he took in the scene
The blue waters of the bay around him the deck of a schooner on which he stood the Whitehall boat alongside and an enormous man with a face like a setting moon wrangling with his friend in the sweaterno longer iridescent
What do you call it
shouted the red man
I want able seamen I dont figger on working this boat with dancing masters do I
We aint exactly doing quadrilles on my quarterdeck
If we dont look out well step on this thing and break it
It aint ought to be let around loose without its ma
Rot that vociferated the brown sweater
I tell you hes one of the best sailor men on the front
If he aint well forfeit the money
Come on Captain Kitchell we made show enough gettin away as it was and this daytime business aint our line
Dyou sign or not
Heres the advance note
I got to duck my nut or Ill have the patrol boat after me
Ill sign this once growled the other scrawling his name on the note but if this swab aint up to sample hell come back by freight an Ill drop in on mee dear friend Jim when we come back and give him a reel nice time an you can lay to that Billy Trim
The brown sweater pocketed the note went over the side and rowed off
Wilbur stood in the waist of a schooner anchored in the stream well off Fishermans wharf
In the forward part of the schooner a Chinaman in brown duck was mixing paint
Wilbur was conscious that he still wore his high hat and long coat but his stick was gone and one gray glove was slit to the button
In front of him towered the enormous redfaced man
A pungent reek of some kind of rancid fat or oil assailed his nostrils
Over by Alcatraz a ferryboat whistled for its slip as it elbowed its way through the water
Wilbur had himself fairly in hand by now
His wits were all about him but the situation was beyond him as yet
Git ford commanded the big man
Wilbur drew himself up angry in an instant
Look here he began whats the meaning of this business
I know Ive been drugged and mishandled
I demand to be put ashore
Do you understand that
Angel child whimpered the big man
Oh you lilee of the vallee you bright an mornin star
Im reely pained yknow that your vally cant come along but well have your piano set up in the lazarette
It gives me genuine grief it do to see you bein obliged to put your lilee white feet on this here vulgar an dirtee deck
Well have the Wilton carpet down by tomorrer so we will my dear
Yahh
he suddenly broke out as his rage boiled over
Git ford dye hear
Im captain of this here bathtub an thats all you need to know for a good while to come
I aint generally got to tell that to a man but once but Ill stretch the point just for love of you angel child
Now then move
Wilbur stood motionlesspuzzled beyond expression
No experience he had ever been through helped in this situation
Look here he began I The captain knocked him down with a blow of one enormous fist upon the mouth and while he was yet stretched upon the deck kicked him savagely in the stomach
Then he allowed him to rise caught him by the neck and the slack of his overcoat and ran him forward to where a hatchway not two feet across opened in the deck
Without ado he flung him down into the darkness below and while Wilbur dizzied by the fall sat on the floor at the foot of the vertical companionladder gazing about him with distended eyes there rained down upon his head first an oilskin coat then a souwester a pair of oilskin breeches woolen socks and a plug of tobacco
Above him down the contracted square of the hatch came the bellowing of the Captains voice Theres your fitout Mister Lilee of the Vallee which the same our dear friend Jim makes a present of and no charge because he loves you so
Youre allowed two minutes to change an it is to be hoped as how you wont force me to come for to assist
It would have been interesting to have followed step by step the mental process that now took place in Ross Wilburs brain
The Captain had given him two minutes in which to change
The time was short enough but even at that Wilbur changed more than his clothes during the two minutes he was left to himself in the reekind dark of the schooners focastle
It was more than a changeit was a revolution
What he made up his mind to do precisely what mental attitude he decided to adopt just what new niche he elected wherein to set his feet it is difficult to say
Only by results could the change be guessed at
He went down the forward hatch at the toe of Kitchells bootsilkhatted melton overcoated patentbooted and gloved in suedes
Two minutes later there emerged upon the deck a figure in oilskins and a souwester
There was blood upon the face of him and the grime of an unclean ship upon his bare hands
It was Wilbur and yet not Wilbur
In two minutes he had been in a way born again
The only traces of his former self were the patentleather boots still persistent in their gloss and shine that showed grim incongruity below the vast compass of the oilskin breeches
As Wilbur came on deck he saw the crew of the schooner hurrying forward six of them Chinamen every one in brown jeans and black felt hats
On the quarterdeck stood the Captain barking his orders
Consider the Lilee of the Vallee bellowed the latter as his eye fell upon Wilbur the Transformed
Clap on to that starboard windlass brake sonny
Wilbur saw the Chinamen ranging themselves about what he guessed was the windlass in the schooners bow
He followed and took his place among them grasping one of the bars
Break down
came the next order
Wilbur and the Chinamen obeyed bearing up and down upon the bars till the slack of the anchorchain came home and stretched taut and dripping from the hawseholes
Vast heavin
And then as Wilbur released the brake and turned about for the next order he cast his glance out upon the bay and there not a hundred and fifty yards away her spotless sails tense her cordage humming her immaculate flanks slipping easily through the waves the water hissing and churning under her forefoot clean gleaming dainty and aristocratic the Ridgeways yacht Petrel passed like a thing of life
Wilbur saw Nat Ridgeway himself at the wheel
Girls in smart gowns and young fellows in white ducks and yachting capsall friends of hiscrowded the decks
A little orchestra of musicians were reeling off a quickstep
The popping of a cork and a gale of talk and laughter came to his ears
Wilbur stared at the picture his face devoid of expression
The Petrel came ondrew nearerwas not a hundred feet away from the schooners stern
A strong swimmer such as Wilbur could cover the distance in a few strides
Two minutes ago Wilbur might have Set your mainsl came the bellow of Captain Kitchell
Clap on to your throat and peak halyards
The Chinamen hurried aft
Wilbur followed
II A NAUTICAL EDUCATTON
In the course of the next few moments while the little vessel was being got under way and while the Ridgeways Petrel gleamed off into the blue distance Wilbur made certain observations
The name of the boat on which he found himself was the Bertha Millner
She was a twotopmast 28ton keel schooner 40 feet long carrying a large spread of sailmainsail foresail jib flyingjib two gafftopsails and a staysail
She was very dirty and smelt abominably of some kind of rancid oil
Her crew were Chinamen there was no mate
But the cookhimself a Chinaman who appeared from time to time at the door of the galley a potatomasher in his hand seemed to have some sort of authority over the hands
He acted in a manner as a gobetween for the Captain and the crew sometimes interpreting the formers orders and occasionally giving one of his own
Wilbur heard the Captain address him as Charlie
He spoke pigeon English fairly
Of the balance of the crewthe five Chinamen Wilbur could make nothing
They never spoke neither to Captain Kitchell to Charlie nor to each other and for all the notice they took of Wilbur he might easily have been a sack of sand
Wilbur felt that his advent on the Bertha Millner was by its very nature an extraordinary event but the absolute indifference of these brownsuited Mongols the blankness of their flat fat faces the dulness of their slanting fishlike eyes that never met his own or even wandered in his direction was uncanny disquieting
In what strange venture was he now to be involved toward what unknown vortex was this new current setting this current that had so suddenly snatched him from the solid ground of his accustomed life
He told himself grimly that he was to have a free cruise up the bay perhaps as far as Alviso perhaps the Bertha Millner would even make the circuit of the bay before returning to San Francisco
He might be gone a week
Wilbur could already see the scareheads of the daily papers the next morning chronicling the disappearance of One of Societys Most Popular Members
Thats well yr throat halyards
Here Lilee of the Vallee give a couple of pulls on yr peak halyard purchase
Wilbur stared at the Captain helplessly
No can tell hey
inquired Charlie from the galley
Pullum disa lope sabe
Wilbur tugged at the rope the cook indicated
Thats well yr peak halyard purchase chanted Captain Kitchell
Wilbur made the rope fast
The mainsail was set and hung slatting and flapping in the wind
Next the forsail was set in much the same manner and Wilbur was ordered to lay out on the jiboom and cast the gaskets off the jib
He lay out as best he could and cast off the gasketshe knew barely enough of yachting to understand an order here and thereand by the time he was back on the focsle head the Chinamen were at the jib halyard and hoisting away
Thats well yr jib halyards
The Bertha Millner veered round and played off to the wind tugging at her anchor
Man yr windlass
Wilbur and the crew jumped once more to the brakes
Brake down heave yr anchor to the cathead
The anchorchain already taut vibrated and then cranked through the hawseholes as the hands rose and fell at the brakes
The anchor came home dripping gray slime
A norwest wind filled the schooners sails a strong ebb tide caught her underfoot
Were off muttered Wilbur as the Bertha Millner heeled to the first gust
But evidently the schooner was not bound up the bay
Must be Vallejo or Benicia then hazarded Wilbur as the sails grew tenser and the water rippled ever louder under the schooners forefoot
Maybe theyre going after hay or wheat
The schooner was tacking headed directly for Meiggss wharf
She came in closer and closer so close that Wilbur could hear the talk of the fishermen sitting on the stringpieces
He had just made up his mind that they were to make a landing there when Stand by for stays came the raucous bark of the Captain who had taken on the heel
The sails slatted furiously as the schooner came about
Then the Bertha Millner caught the wind again and lay over quietly and contentedly to her work
The next tack brought the schooner close under Alcatraz
The sea became heavier the breeze grew stiff and smelled of the outside ocean
Out beyond them to westward opened the Golden Gate a bleak vista of graygreen water roughened with whitecaps
Stand by for stays
Once again as the rudder went hard over the Bertha Millner fretted and danced and shook her sails calling impatiently for the wind chafing at its absence like a child reft of a toy
Then again she scooped the norwester in the hollow palms of her tense canvases and settled quietly down on the new tack her bowsprit pointing straight toward the Presidio
Well come about again soon Wilbur told himself and stand over toward the Contra Costa shore
A fine huge breath of wind passed over the schooner
She heeled it on the instant the water roaring along her quarter but she kept her course
Wilbur fell thoughtful again never more keenly observant
She must come about soon he muttered uneasily if shes going to stand up toward Vallejo
His heart sank with a sudden apprehension
A nervousness he could not overcome seized upon him
The Bertha Millner held tenaciously to the tack
Within fifty yards of the Presidio came the command again Stand by for stays
Once more her bows dancing her cordage rattling her sails flapping noisily the schooner came about
Anxiously Wilbur observed the bowsprit as it circled like a hand on a dial watching where now it would point
It wavered fluctuated rose fell then settled easily pointing toward Lime Point
Wilbur felt a sudden coldness at his heart
This isnt going to be so much fun he muttered between his teeth
The schooner was not bound up the bay for Alviso nor to Vallejo for grain
The track toward Lime Point could mean but one thing
The wind was freshening from the norwest the ebb tide rushing out to meet the ocean like a millrace at every moment the Golden Gate opened out wider and within two minutes after the time of the last tack the Bertha Millner heeled to a great gust that had come booming in between the heads straight from the open Pacific
Stand by for stays
As before one of the Chinese hands stood by the sail rope of the jib
Draw yr jib
The jib filled
The schooner came about on the port tack Lime Point fell away over the stern rail
The huge ground swells began to come in and as she rose and bowed to the first of these it was precisely as though the Bertha Millner were making her courtesy to the great gray ocean now for the first time in full sight on her starboard quarter
The schooner was beating out to sea through the Middle Channel
Once clear of the Golden Gate she stood over toward the Cliff House then on the next tack cleared Point Bonita
The sea began building up in deadly earnestthey were about to cross the bar
Everything was battened down the scuppers were awash and the hawseholes spouted like fountains after every plunge
Once the Captain ordered all men aloft just in time to escape a gigantic dull green roller that broke like a Niagara over the schooners bows smothering the decks kneedeep in a twinkling
The wind blew violent and cold the spray was flying like icy smallshot
Without intermission the Bertha Millner rolled and plunged and heaved and sank
Wilbur was drenched to the skin and sore in every joint from being shunted from rail to mast and from mast to rail again
The cordage sang like harpstrings the schooners forefoot crushed down into the heaving water with a hissing like that of steam blocks rattled the Captain bellowed his orders ropeends flogged the hollow deck till it reverberated like a drumhead
The crossing of the bar was one long halfhour of confusion and discordant sound
When they were across the bar the Captain ordered the cook to give the men their food
Git forrd sonny he added fixing Wilbur with his eye
Git forrd this is tawble dee hote savvy
Wilbur crawled forward on the reeling deck holding on now to a mast now to a belayingpin now to a stay watching his chance and going on between the inebriated plunges of the schooner
He descended the focsle hatch
The Chinamen were already there sitting on the edges of their bunks
On the floor at the bottom of the ladder punksticks were burning in an old tomatocan
Charlie brought in supperstewed beef and pork in a breadpan and a wooden kitand the Chinamen ate in silence with their sheath knives and from tin plates
A liquid that bore a distant resemblance to coffee was served
Wilbur learned afterward to know the stuff as Black Jack and to be aware that it was made from bud barley and was sweetened with molasses
A single reeking lamp swung with the swinging of the schooner over the centre of the group and long after Wilbur could remember the grisly scene the punksticks the breadpan full of hunks of meat the horrid close and oily smell and the circle of silent preoccupied Chinese each sitting on his bunkledge devouring stewed pork and holding his pannikin of Black Jack between his feet against the rolling of the boat
Wilbur looked fearfully at the mess in the pan recalling the chocolate and stuffed olives that had been his last luncheon
Well he muttered clinching his teeth Ive got to come to it sooner or later
His penknife was in the pocket of his waist coat underneath his oilskin coat
He opened the big blade harpooned a cube of pork and deposited it on his tin plate
He ate it slowly and with savage determination
But the Black Jack was more than he could bear
Im not hungry enough for that just now he told himself
Say Jim he said turning to the Chinaman next him on the bunkledge say what kind of boat is this
What you dowhere you go
The other moved away impatiently
No sabe no sabe he answered shaking his head and frowning
Throughout the whole of that strange meal these were the only words spoken
When Wilbur came on deck again he noted that the Bertha Millner had already left the whistlingbuoy astern
Off to the east her sails just showing above the waves was a pilotboat with the number 7 on her mainsail
The evening was closing in the Farallones were in plain sight dead ahead
Far behind in a mass of shadow just bluer than the sky he could make out a few twinkling lightsSan Francisco
Half an hour later Kitchell came on deck from his supper in the cabin aft
He glanced in the direction of the mainland now almost out of sight then took the wheel from one of the Chinamen and commanded Ease off yr fore an main sheets
The hands eased away and the schooner played off before the wind
The staysail was set
The Bertha Millner headed to southwest bowling easily ahead of a good eightknot breeze
Next came the order All hands aft
and Wilbur and his mates betook themselves to the quarterdeck
Charlie took the wheel and he and Kitchell began to choose the men for their watches just as Wilbur remembered to have chosen sides for baseball during his school days
Sonny Ill choose you youre on my watch said the Captain to Wilbur and I will assoom the reesponsibility of your nautical eddoocation
I may as well tell you at once began Wilbur that Im no sailor
But you will be soon answered the Captain at once soothing and threatening you will be Mister Lilee of the Vallee you kin lay to it as how you will be one of the best sailormen along the front as our dear friend Jim says
Before I git throo with you youll be a sailorman or sharkbait I can promise you
Youre on my watch step over here son
The watches were divided Charlie and three other Chinamen on the port Kitchell Wilbur and two Chinamen on the starboard
The men trooped forward again
The tiny world of the schooner had lapsed to quiet
The Bertha Millner was now clear of the land that lay like a blur of faintest purple smokeever growing fainterlow in the east
The Farallones showed but their shoulders above the horizon
The schooner was standing well out from shoreeven beyond the track of the coasters and passenger steamersto catch the Trades from the northwest
The sun was setting royally and the floor of the ocean shimmered like mosaic
The sea had gone down and the fury of the bar was a thing forgotten
It was perceptibly warmer
On board the two watches mingled forward smoking opium and playing a game that looked like checkers
Three of them were washing down the decks with kaiar brooms
For the first time since he had come on board Wilbur heard the sound of their voices
The evening was magnificent
Never to Wilburs eyes had the Pacific appeared so vast so radiant so divinely beautiful
A star or two burned slowly through that part of the sky where the pink began to fade into the blue
Charlie went forward and set the side lightsred on the port rigging green on the starboard
As he passed Wilbur who was leaning over the rail and watching the phosphorus flashing just under the surface he said Hey you go talkeetalk onepiecey Boss savvy Bosschinchin
Wilbur went aft and came up on the poop where Kitchell stood at the wheel smoking an inverted Tarriers Delight
Now son began Kitchell I natchly love you so that Im goin to do you a reel favor do you twig
Im goin to allow you to berth aft in the cabin long o me an Charlie an beesides you can make free of my quarterdeck
Mebbee you aint used to the ways of sailormen just yet but you can lay to it that those two are reel concessions savvy
I aint a mushhead like mee dear friend Jim
You aint no waterfront swine I can guess that with one hand tied beehind me
Youre a toff thats what you are and your lines has been laid for toffs
I aint askin you no questions but you got brains an I figger on gettin more outa you by lettin you have yr head a bit
But mind now you get gay once sonny or try to flimflam me or forget that Im the boss of the bathtub an strike me blind Ill cut you open an you can lay to that son
Now then heres the game You work this boat long with the coolies an take my orders an walk chalk an Ill teach you navigation an make this cruise as easy as howdoyoudo
You dont an Ill manhandle you till yr bones come throo yr hide
Ive no choice in the matter said Wilbur
Ive got to make the best of a bad situation
I reemarked as how you had brains muttered the Captain
But theres one thing continued Wilbur if Im to have my head a little as you say youll find we can get along better if you put me to rights about this whole business
Why was I brought aboard why are there only Chinese along where are we going what are we going to do and how long are we going to be gone
Kitchell spat over the side and then sucked the nicotine from his mustache
Well he said resuming his pipe its like this son
This ship belongs to one of the Six Chinese Companies of Chinatown in Frisco
Charlie here is one of the shareholders in the business
We go down here twice a year off Cape Sain Lucas Lower California an fish for blue sharks or white if we kin ketch em
We get the livers of these an try out the oil an we bring back that same oil an the Chinamen sell it all over San Francisco as simonpure codliver oil savvy
An it pays like a nitrate bed
I come in because its a Customhouse regulation that no coolie can take a boat out of Frisco
And how do I come in
asked Wilbur
Mee dear friend Jim put a knockmeout drop into your Manhattan cocktail
Its a capsule filled with a drug
You were shanghaied son said the Captain blandly
          About an hour later Wilbur turned in
Kitchell showed him his bunk with its donkeys breakfast and single illsmelling blanket
It was located under the companionway that led down into the cabin
Kitchell bunked on one side Charlie on the other
A hacked deal table covered with oilcloth and ironed to the floor a swinginglamp two chairs a rack of books a chest or two and a flaring picture cut from the advertisement of a ballet was the rooms inventory in the matter of furniture and ornament
Wilbur sat on the edge of his bunk before undressing reviewing the extraordinary events of the day
In a moment he was aware of a movement in one of the other two bunks and presently made out Charlie lying on his side and holding in the flame of an alcohol lamp a skewer on which some brown and sticky stuff boiled and sizzled
He transformed the stuff to the bowl of a huge pipe and drew on it noisily once or twice
In another moment he had sunk back in his bunk nearly senseless but with a long breath of an almost blissful contentment
Beast
muttered Wilbur with profound disgust
He threw off his oilskin coat and felt in the pocket of his waistcoat which he had retained when he had changed his clothes in the focsle for his watch
He drew it out
It was just nine oclock
All at once an idea occurred to him
He fumbled in another pocket of the waistcoat and brought out one of his callingcards
For a moment Wilbur remained motionless seated on the bunkledge smiling grimly while his glance wandered now to the sordid cabin of the Bertha Millner and the opiumdrugged coolie sprawled on the donkeys breakfast and now to the card in his hand on which a few hours ago he had written First waltzJo
III THE LADY LETTY Another day passed then two
Before Wilbur knew it he had settled himself to his new life and woke one morning to the realization that he was positively enjoying himself
Daily the weather grew warmer
The fifth day out from San Francisco it was actually hot
The pitch grew soft in the Bertha Millners deck seams the masts sweated resin
The Chinamen went about the decks wearing but their jeans and blouses
Kitchell had long since abandoned his coat and vest
Wilburs oilskins became intolerable and he was at last constrained to trade his pocket knife to Charlie for a suit of jeans and wicker sandals such as the coolies woreand odd enough he looked in them
The Captain instructed him in steering and even promised to show him the use of the sextant and how to take an observation in the fake short and easy coasting style of navigation
Furthermore he showed him how to read the log and the manner of keeping the dead reckoning
During most of his watches Wilbur was engaged in painting the inside of the cabin door panels lintels and the few scattered moldings and toward the middle of the first week out when the Bertha Millner was in the latitude of Point Conception he and three Chinamen under Kitchells directions ratlined down the forerigging and affixed the crows nest upon the formast
The next morning during Charlies watch on deck a Chinaman was sent up into the crows nest and from that time on there was always a lookout maintained from the masthead
More than once Wilbur looked around him at the empty coruscating indigo of the ocean floor wondering at the necessity of the lookout and finally expressed his curiosity to Kitchell
The Captain had now taken not a little to Wilbur at first for the sake of a white mans company and afterward because he began to place a certain vague reliance upon Wilburs judgment
Kitchell had reemarked as how he had brains
Well you see son Kitchell had explained to Wilbur os tensiblee we are after sharkliver oiland so we are but also we are on any lay that turns up ready for any game from wrecking to barratry
Strike me if I havent thought of scuttling the dough dish for her insoorance
Theres regular trade son to be done in ships and then theres pickins an pickins an pickins
Lord the oceans rich with pickins
Do you know theres millions made out of the daybree and refuse of a big city
How about an oceans daybree just chew on that notion a turn an as fur a lookout lemmee tell you son cast your eye out yon and he swept the sea with a forearm nothin hey so it looks but lemmee tell you son there aint no manner of place on the ball of dirt where youre likely to run up afoul of so many things unexpected thingsas at sea
When youre clear o land lay to this here preecep A million to one on the unexpected
The next day fell almost dead calm
The hale lustylunged norwester that had snorted them forth from the Golden Gate had lapsed to a zephyr the schooner rolled lazily southward with the leisurely nonchalance of a grazing ox
At noon just after dinner a few catspaws curdled the milkyblue whiteness of the glassy surface and the water once more began to talk beneath the bowsprit
It was very hot
The sun spun silently like a spinning brass discus over the mainmast
On the focsle head the Chinamen were asleep or smoking opium
It was Charlies watch
Kitchell dozed in his hammock in the shadow of the mainsheet
Wilbur was below tinkering with his paintpot about the cabin
The stillness was profound
It was the stillness of the summer sea at high noon
The lookout in the crows nest broke the quiet
Hyyah hyyah
he cried leaning from the barrel and calling through an arched palm
Hyyah one two plenty many tortle topside wattah hyyah allsame tortle
Hello hello
cried the Captain rolling from his hammock
Turtle
Whereaway
I tinkum bout quallah mile mebbee fourpiecee tortle allsame weatha bow
Turtle hey
Down yr wheel Jim haul yr jib to winward he commanded the man at the wheel then to the men forward Get the dory overboard
Son Charlie and you Wing tumble in
Wake up now and see you stay so
The dory was swung over the side and the men dropped into her and took their places at the oars
Give way cried the Captain settling himself in the bow with the gaff in his hand
Hey Jim
he shouted to the lookout far above hey lay our course for us
The lookout nodded the oars fell and the dory shot forward in the direction indicated by the lookout
Kin you row son
asked Kitchell with sudden suspicion
Wilbur smiled
You ask Charlie and Wing to ship their oars and give me a pair
The Captain complied hesitating
Now what he said grimly now what do you think youre going to do sonny
Im going to show you the Bob Cook stroke we used in our boat in 95 when we beat Harvard answered Wilbur
Kitchell gazed doubtfully at the first few strokes then with growing interest watched the tremendous reach the powerful knee drive the swing the easy catch and the perfect recover
The dory was cutting the water like a gasoline launch and between strokes there was the least possible diminishing of the speed
Im a bit out of form just now remarked Wilbur and Im used to the sliding seat but I guess itll do
Kitchell glanced at the human machine that once was No
5 in the Yale boat and then at the water hissing from the dorys bows
My Gawd
he said under his breath
He spat over the bows and sucked the nicotine from his mustache thoughtfully
I reemarked he observed as how you had brains my son
A few minutes later the Captain who was standing in the dorys bow and alternately conning the oceans surface and looking back to the Chinaman standing on the schooners masthead uttered an exclamation Steady ship your oars quiet now quiet you damn fools
Were right on emfour by Gawd an big as dinin tables
The oars were shipped
The dorys speed dwindled
Out your paddles sit on the gunl and paddle eeasy
The hands obeyed
The Captains voice dropped to a whisper
His back was toward them and he gestured with one free hand
Looking out over the water from his seat on the gunl Wilbur could make out a round greenish mass like a patch of floating seaweed just under the surface some sixty yards ahead
Easy staboard whispered the Captain under his elbow
Go ahead port eeeasy all steady steady
The affair began to assume the intensity of a little dramaa little drama of midocean
In spite of himself Wilbur was excited
He even found occasion to observe that the life was not so bad after all
This was as good fun as stalking deer
The dory moved forward by inches
Kitchells whisper was as faint as a dying infants Steady all ssteadee shstead He lunged forward sharply with the gaff and shouted aloud I got himgrab holt his tail flippers you fool swabs grab holt quick dont you leggogot him there Charlie
If he gets away you swine Ill rip y open with the gaffheave nowheavethere theresoh stand clear his nippers
Strike me
hes a whacker
I thought he was going to get away
Saw me just as I swung the gaff an ducked his nut
Over the side bundled without ceremony into the boat clawing thrashing clattering and blowing like the exhaust of a donkey engine tumbled the great green turtle his wet green shield of shell three feet from edge to edge the gaff firmly transfixed in his body just under the foreflipper
From under his shell protruded his snakelike head and neck withered like that of an old man
He was waving his head from side to side the jaws snapping like a snapped silk handkerchief
Kitchell thrust him away with a paddle
The turtle craned his neck and catching the bit of wood in his jaw bit it in two in a single grip
I tol you so I tol you to stand clear his snapper
If that had been your shin now eh
Hello whats that
Faintly across the water came a prolonged hallooing from the schooner
Kitchell stood up in the dory shading his eyes with his hat
Whats biting em now
he muttered with the uneasiness of a captain away from his ship
Oughta left Charlie on boardor you son
Whos doin that yellin I cant make out
Up in the crows nest exclaimed Wilbur
Its Jim see hes waving his arms
Well whaduz he wave his dam fool arms for
growled Kitchell angry because something was going forward he did not understand
There hes shouting again
ListenI cant make out what hes yelling
Hell yell to a different pipe when I get my grip of him
Ill twist the head of that swab till hell have to walk backard to see where hes goin
Whaduz he wave his arms forwhaduz he yell like a dam phillyloo bird for
Whats him say Charlie
Jim heap sing no can tell
Mebbeetinkum sing come back chop chop
Well see
Oars out men give way
Now son put a little o that Yale stingo in the stroke
In the crows nest Jim still yelled and waved like one distraught while the dory returned at a smart clip toward the schooner
Kitchell lathered with fury
Ohh he murmured softly through his gritted teeth
Jess lemmee lay mee two hands afoul of you wunst you gibbering yellow phillyloo bird believe me youll dance
Shut up
he roared shut up you crazy dodo aint we coming fast as we can
The dory bumped alongside and the Captain was over the rail like quicksilver
The hands were all in the bow looking and pointing to the west
Jim slid down the ratlines bubbling over with suppressed news
Before his feet had touched the deck Kitchell had kicked him into the stays again fulminating blasphemies
Sing
he shouted as the Chinaman clambered away like a bewildered ape sing a little more
I would if I were you
Why dont you sing and wave you dam fool phillyloo bird
Yas sah answered the coolie
What you yell for
Charlie ask him whaffo him sing
I tinkum ship answered Charlie calmly looking out over the starboard quarter
Ship
Him velly sick hazarded the Chinaman from the ratlines adding a sentence in Chinese to Charlie
He says he tinkum ship sick all same ask um somethingship velly sick
By this time the Captain Wilbur and all on board could plainly make out a sail some eight miles off the starboard bow
Even at that distance and to eyes so inexperienced as those of Wilbur it needed but a glance to know that something was wrong with her
It was not that she failed to ride the waves with even keel it was not that her rigging was in disarray nor that her sails were disordered
Her distance was too great to make out such details
But in precisely the same manner as a trained physician glances at a doomed patient and from that indefinable look in the face of him and the eyes of him pronounces the verdict death so Kitchell took in the stranger with a single comprehensive glance and exclaimed Wreck
Yas sah
I tinkum velly sick
Oh go to ll or go below and fetch up my glasshustle
The glass was brought
Son exclaimed Kitchellwhere is that man with the brains
Son come aloft here with me
The two clambered up the ratlines to the crows nest
Kitchell adjusted the glass
Shes a bark he muttered iron builtabout seven hundred tons I guessin distress
Theres her ensign upside down at the mizznheadlooks like Norwayan her distress signals on the spanker gaff
Take a blink at her sonwhat do you make her out
Lord shes ridin high
Wilbur took the glass catching the stranger after several clumsy attempts
She was as Captain Kitchell had announced a bark and to judge by her flag evidently Norwegian
How she rolls
muttered Wilbur
Thats what I cant make out answered Kitchell
A bark such as she aint ought to roll thata way her ballastd steady her
Whats the flags on that boom aftones red and white and squareshaped and the others the same color only swallowtail in shape
Thats H B meanin I am in need of assistance
Well wheres the crew
I dont see anybody on board
Oh theyre there right enough
Then theyre pretty well concealed about the premises turned Wilbur as he passed the glass to the Captain
She does seem kinda empty said the Captain in a moment with a sudden show of interest that Wilbur failed to understand
An wheres her boats
continued Kitchell
I dont just quite make out any boats at all
There was a long silence
Seems to be a sort of haze over her observed Wilbur
I noticed that air kinda quivers oilylike
No boats no boats an I cant see anybody aboard
Suddenly Kitchell lowered the glass and turned to Wilbur
He was a different man
There was a new shine in his eyes a wicked line appeared over the nose the jaw grew salient prognathous
Son he exclaimed gimleting Wilbur with his contracted eves I have reemarked as how you had brains
I kin fool the coolies but I cant fool you
It looks to me as if that bark yonder was a derelict an do you know what that means to us
Chaw on it a turn
A derelict
If theres a crew on board theyre concealed from the public gazean where are the boats then
I figger shes an abandoned derelict
Do you know what that means for usfor you and I
It means and gripping Wilbur by the shoulders he spoke the word into his face with a savage intensity
It means salvage do you savvysalvage salvage
Do you figger what salvage on a seven hundredtonner would come to
Well just lemmee drop it into your think tank an lay to what I say
Its all the ways from fifty to seventy thousand dollars whatever her cargo is call it sixty thousandthirty thou apiece
Oh I dont know
he exclaimed lapsing to landmans slang
Whad I say about a million to one on the unexpected at sea
Thirty thousand
exclaimed Wilbur without thought as yet
Now yr singin songs cried the Captain
Listen to me son he went on rapidly shutting up the glass and thrusting it back in the case my names Kitchell and Im hog right through
He emphasized the words with a leveled forefinger his eyes flashing
HOG spells very truly yours Alvinza Kitchellninetynine swine an me make a hundred swine
Im a shoat with both feet in the trough first last an always
If that barks abandoned an I says she is shes ours
Im out for anything that theres stuff in
I guess Im more of a beachcomber by nature than anything else
If shes abandoned she belongs to us
To ll with this coolie game
Well go beachcombin you and I
Well board that bark and work her into the nearest portSan Diego I guess and get the salvage on her if we have to swim in her
Are you with me
he held out his hand
The man was positively trembling from head to heel
It was impossible to resist the excitement of the situation its noveltythe high crows nest of the schooner the keen salt air the Chinamen grouped far below the indigo of the warm ocean and out yonder the forsaken derelict rolling her light hull till the garboard streak flashed in the sun
Well of course Im with you Cap exclaimed Wilbur gripping Kitchells hand
When theres thirty thousand to be had for the asking I guess Im a nachel bawn beachcomber myself
Now nothing about this to the coolies
But how will you make out with your owners the Six Companies
Arent you bound to bring the Bertha in
Rot my owners
exclaimed Kitchell
I aint a skipper of no oilboat any longer
Im a beachcomber
He fixed the wallowing bark with glistening eyes
Gawd strike me he murmured aint she a daisy
Its a little Klondike
Come on son
The two went down the ratlines and Kitchell ordered a couple of the hands into the dory that had been rowing astern
He and Wilbur followed
Charlie was left on board with directions to lay the schooner to
The dory flew over the water Wilbur setting the stroke
In a few moments she was well up with the bark
Though a larger boat than the Bertha Millner she was rolling in lamentable fashion and every laboring heave showed her bottom incrusted with barnacles and seaweed
Her fore and main topsls and togallantsls were set as also were her lower staysls and royals
But the braces seemed to have parted and the yards were swinging back and forth in their ties
The spanker was brailed up and the spanker boom thrashed idly over the poop as the bark rolled and rolled and rolled
The mainmast was working in its shoe the rigging and backstays sagged
An air of abandonment of unspeakable loneliness of abomination hung about her
Never had Wilbur seen anything more utterly alone
Within three lengths the Captain rose in his place and shouted Bark ahoy
There was no answer
Thrice he repeated the call and thrice the dismal thrashing of the spanker boom and the flapping of the sails was the only answer
Kitchell turned to Wilbur in triumph
I guess shes ours he whispered
They were now close enough to make out the barks name upon her counter Lady Letty and Wilbur was in the act of reading it aloud when a huge brown dorsal fin like the triangular sail of a lugger cut the water between the dory and the bark
Shark
said Kitchell and theres another
he exclaimed in the next instant and another
Strike me the waters alive with em
Theres a stiff on the bark you can lay to that and at that acting on some strange impulse he called again Bark ahoy
There was no response
The dory was now well up to the derelict and pretty soon a prolonged and vibratory hissing noise strident insistent smote upon their ears
Whats that
exclaimed Wilbur perplexed
The Captain shook his head and just then as the bark rolled almost to her scuppers in their direction a glimpse of the deck was presented to their view
It was only a glimpse gone on the instant as the bark rolled back to port but it was time enough for Wilbur and the Captain to note the parted and open seams and the deck bulging and in one corner blown up and splintered
The captain smote a thigh
Coal
he cried
Anthracite coal
The coal het up and generated gas of courseno fire yunderstand just gasgas blew up the deckno way of stopping combustion
Naturally they had to cut for it
Smell the gas cant you
No wonder shes hissingno wonder she rolledcargo goes off in gasand whats to weigh her down
I was wondering what could a wrecked her in this weather
Lord its as plain as Billybdamn
The dory was alongside
Kitchell watched his chance and as the bark rolled down caught the mainyardbrace hanging in a bight over the rail and swung himself to the deck
Look sharp
he called as Wilbur followed
It wont do for you to fall among them shark son
Just look at the hundreds of em
Theres a stiff on board sure
Wilbur steadied himself on the swaying broken deck choking against the reek of coalgas that hissed upward on every hand
The heat was almost like a furnace
Everything metal was intolerable to the touch
Shes abandoned sure muttered the Captain
Look and he pointed to the empty chocks on the house and the severed lashings
Oh its a haul son its a haul an you can lay to that
Now then cabin first and he started aft
But it was impossible to go into the cabin
The moment the door was opened suffocating billows of gas rushed out and beat them back
On the third trial the Captain staggered out almost overcome with its volume
Cant get in there for a while yet he gasped but I saw the stiff on the floor by the table looks like the old man
Hes spit his false teeth out
I knew there was a stiff aboard
Then theres more than one said Wilbur
See there
From behind the wheelbox in the stern protruded a hand and forearm in an oilskin sleeve
Wilbur ran up peered over the little space between the wheel and the wheelbox and looked straight into a pair of eyeseyes that were alive
Kitchell came up
One left anyhow he muttered looking over Wilburs shoulder sailor man though cant interfere with our salvage
The barks derelict right enough
Shake him out of there son cant you see the lads dotty with the gas
Cramped into the narrow space of the wheelbox like a terrified hare in a blind burrow was the figure of a young boy
So firmly was he wedged into the corner that Kitchell had to kick down the box before he could be reached
The boy spoke no word
Stupefied with the gas he watched them with vacant eyes
Wilbur put a hand under the lads arm and got him to his feet
He was a tall wellmade fellow with ruddy complexion and milkblue eyes and was dressed as if for heavy weather in oilskins
Well sonny youve had a fine mess aboard here said Kitchell
The boyhe might have been two and twentystared and frowned
Clean loco from the gas
Get him into the dory son
Ill try this bloody cabin again
Kitchell turned back and descended from the poop and Wilbur his arm around the boy followed
Kitchell was already out of hearing and Wilbur was bracing himself upon the rolling deck steadying the young fellow at his side when the latter heaved a deep breath
His throat and breast swelled
Wilbur stared sharply with a muttered exclamation My God its a girl
he said
IV MORAN Meanwhile Charlie had brought the Bertha Millner up to within hailing distance of the bark and had hove her to
Kitchell ordered Wilbur to return to the schooner and bring over a couple of axes
Well have to knock holes all through the house and break in the skylights and let the gas escape before we can do anything
Take the kid over and give him whiskey then come along back and bear a hand
Wilbur had considerable difficulty in getting into the dory from the deck of the plunging derelict with his dazed and almost helpless charge
Even as he slid down the rope into the little boat and helped the girl to follow he was aware of two dull brownishgreen shadows moving just beneath the waters surface not ten feet away and he knew that he was being stealthily watched
The Chinamen at the oars of the dory with that extraordinary absence of curiosity which is the mark of the race did not glance a second time at the survivor of the Lady Lettys misadventure
To them it was evident she was but a formast hand
However Wilbur examined her with extraordinary interest as she sat in the sternsheets sullen halfdefiant halfbewildered and bereft of speech
She was not prettyshe was too tall for thatquite as tall as Wilbur himself and her skeleton was too massive
Her face was red and the glint of blue ice was in her eyes
Her eyelashes and eyebrows as well as the almost imperceptible down that edged her cheek when she turned against the light were blond almost to whiteness
What beauty she had was of the fine hardy Norse type
Her hands were red and hard and even beneath the coarse sleeve of the oilskin coat one could infer that the biceps and deltoids were large and powerful
She was coarsefibred no doubt mentally as well as physically but her coarseness so Wilbur guessed would prove to be the coarseness of a primitive rather than of a degenerate character
One thing he saw clearly during the few moments of the dorys trip between bark and schoonerthe fact that his charge was a woman must be kept from Captain Kitchell
Wilbur knew his man by now
It could be done
Kitchell and he would take the Lady Letty into the nearest port as soon as possible
The deception would have to be maintained only for a day or two
He left the girl on board the schooner and returned to the derelict with the axes
He found Kitchell on the house just returned from a hasty survey of the prize
Shes a daisy vociferated the Captain as Wilbur came aboard
Ive been havin a look round
Shes brandnew
See the date on the capstnhead
Christiania is her hailin portbuilt there but its her papers Im after
Then well know where were at
Hows the kid
Shes all right answered Wilbur before he could collect his thoughts
But the Captain thought he had reference to the Bertha
I mean the kid we found in the wheelbox
He doesnt count in our salvage
The barks been abandoned as plain as paint
If I thought he stood in our way and Kitchells jaw grew salient
Id shut him in the cabin with the old man a spell till hed copped off
Now then son first thing to do is to chop vents in this yere house
Hold upwe can do better than that said Wilbur restraining Kitchells fury of impatience
Slide the big skylight offits loose already
A couple of the schooners hands were ordered aboard the Lady Letty and the skylight removed
At first the pour of gas was terrific but by degrees it abated and at the end of half an hour Kitchell could keep back no longer
Come on
he cried catching up an axe rot the difference
All the plundering instincts of the man were aroused and clamoring
He had become a very wolf within scent of its preya veritable hyena nuzzling about its carrion
Lord
he gasped t think that everything we see everything we find is ours
Wilbur himself was not far behind him in eagerness
Somewhere deep down in the heart of every AngloSaxon lies the predatory instinct of his Viking ancestorsan instinct that a thousand years of respectability and taxpaying have not quite succeeded in eliminating
A flight of six steps brassbound and bearing the double L of the barks monogram led them down into a sort of vestibule
From the vestibule a door opened directly into the main cabin
They entered
The cabin was some twenty feet long and unusually spacious
Fresh from his recollection of the grime and reek of the schooner it struck Wilbur as particularly dainty
It was painted white with stripes of blue gold and peagreen
On either side three doors opened off into staterooms and private cabins and with each roll of the derelict these doors banged like an irregular discharge of revolvers
In the centre was the diningtable covered with a red cloth very much awry
On each side of the table were four arm chairs screwed to the deck one somewhat larger at the head
Overhead in swinging racks were glasses and decanters of whiskey and some kind of white wine
But for one feature the sight of the Lettys cabin was charming
However on the floor by the sliding door in the forward bulkhead lay a body face upward
The body was that of a middleaged finelooking man his head covered with the fur earlapped cap that Norwegians affect even in the tropics
The eyes were wide open the face discolored
In the last gasp of suffocation the set of false teeth had been forced halfway out of his mouth distorting the countenance with a hideous simian grin
Instantly Kitchells eye was caught by the glint of the gold in which these teeth were set
Heres about 100 to begin with he exclaimed and picking up the teeth dropped them into his pocket with a wink at Wilbur
The body of the dead Captain was passed up through the skylight and slid out on the deck and Wilbur and Kitchell turned their attention to what had been his stateroom
The Captains room was the largest one of the six staterooms opening from the main cabin
Here we are
exclaimed Kitchell as he and Wilbur entered
The old mans room and no mistake
Besides the bunk the stateroom was fitted up with a lounge of red plush screwed to the bulkhead
A roll of charts leaned in one corner an alarm clock stopped at 115 stood on a shelf in the company of some dozen papercovered novels and a drinkingglass full of cigars
Over the lounge however was the rack of instruments sextant barometer chronometer glass and the like securely screwed down while against the wall in front of a swivel leather chair that was ironed to the deck was the locked secretary
Look at em just look at em will you
said Kitchell running his fingers lovingly over the polished brass of the instruments
Theres a thousand dollars of stuff right here
The chronometers worth five hundred alone Bennett  Sons own make
He turned to the secretary
Now
he exclaimed with a long breath
What followed thrilled Wilbur with alternate excitement curiosity and a vivid sense of desecration and sacrilege
For the life of him he could not make the thing seem right or legal in his eyes and yet he had neither the wish nor the power to stay his hand or interfere with what Kitchell was doing
The Captain put the blade of the axe in the chink of the secretarys door and wrenched it free
It opened down to form a sort of desk and disclosed an array of cubbyholes and two small doors both locked
These latter Kitchell smashed in with the axehead
Then he seated himself in the swivel chair and began to rifle their contents systematically Wilbur leaning over his shoulder
The heat from the coal below them was almost unbearable
In the cabin the six doors kept up a continuous earshocking fusillade as though half a dozen men were fighting with revolvers from without down the open skylight came the singsong talk of the Chinamen and the wash and ripple of the two vessels now side by side
The air foul beyond expression tasted of brass their heads swam and ached to bursting but absorbed in their work they had no thought of the lapse of time nor the discomfort of their surroundings
Twice during the examination of the barks papers Kitchell sent Wilbur out into the cabin for the whiskey decanter in the swinging racks
Heres the charter papers said Kitchell unfolding and spreading them out one by one and heres the clearing papers from Blyth in England
This yeres the insoorance and here this isrot that nothin but the articles for the crewno use to us
In a separate envelope carefully sealed and bound they came upon the Captains private papers
A marriage certificate setting forth the union between Eilert Sternersen of Fruholmen Norway and Sarah Moran of some seaport town the name was indecipherable of the North of England
Next came a birth certificate of a daughter named Moran dated twentytwo years back and a bill of sale of the bark Lady Letty whereby a two thirds interest was conveyed from the previous owners a shipbuilding firm of Christiania to Capt
Eilert Sternersen
The old man was his own boss commented Kitchell
Hello
he remarked look here a yellowed photograph was in his hand the picture of a stout fairhaired woman of about forty wearing enormous pendant earrings in the style of the early sixties
Below was written S Moran Sternersen ob
1867
Old woman copped off said Kitchell so much the better for us no heirs to put in their gab anhold hardsteady allheres the will shelp me
The only items of importance in the will were the confirmation of the wifes death and the expressly stated bequest of the bark known as and sailing under the name of the Lady Letty to my only and beloved daughter Moran
Well said Wilbur
The Captain sucked his mustache then furiously striking the desk with his fist The barks ours
there was a certain ring of defiance in his voice
Damn the will
I aint so cocksure about the law but Ill make sure
As how
said Wilbur
Kitchell slung the will out of the open port into the sea
Thats how he remarked
Im the heir
I found the bark mine she is an mine she staysyours an mine that is
But Wilbur had not even time to thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction that the Captains words conveyed before an idea suddenly presented itself to him
The girl he had found on board of the bark the ruddy fairhaired girl of the fine and hardy Norse typethat was the daughter of course that was Moran
Instantly the situation adjusted itself in his imagination
The two inseparables father and daughter sailors both their lives passed together on ship board and the Lady Letty their dream their ambition a vessel that at last they could call their own
Then this disastrous voyageperhaps the first in their new craft the combustion in the coalthe panic terror of the crew and their desertion of the bark and the sturdy resolution of the father and daughter to bring the Letty into work her into port alone
They had failed the father had died from gas the girl at least for the moment was crazed from its effects
But the bark had not been abandoned
The owner was on board
Kitchell was wrong she was no derelict not one penny could they gain by her salvage
For an instant a wave of bitterest disappointment passed over Wilbur as he saw his 30000 dwindling to nothing
Then the instincts of habit reasserted themselves
The taxpayer in him was stronger than the freebooter after all
He felt that it was his duty to see to it that the girl had her rights
Kitchell must be made aware of the situationmust be told that Moran the daughter the Captains heir was on board the schooner that the kid found in the wheelbox was a girl
But on second thought that would never do
Above all things the brute Kitchell must not be shown that a girl was aboard the schooner on which he had absolute command nor setting the question of Morans sex aside must Kitchell know her even as the dead Captains heir
There was a difference in the men here and Wilbur appreciated it
Kitchell the lawabiding taxpayer was a weakling in comparison with Kitchell the freebooter and beachcomber in sight of his prize
Son said the Captain making a bundle of all the papers take these over to my bunk and hide em under the donkeys breakfast
Stop a bit he added as Wilbur started away
Ill go with you
Well have to bury the old man
Throughout all the afternoon the Captain had been drinking the whiskey from the decanter found in the cabin now he stood up unsteadily and raising his glass exclaimed Sonny heres to Kitchell Wilbur  Co beachcombers unlimited
What do you say hey
I only want to be sure that weve a right to the bark answered Wilbur
Right to herrihight to er hiccoughed the Captain
Strike me blind Id like to see any one tryn take her away from Alvinza Kitchell now and he thrust out his chin at Wilbur
Well so much the better then said Wilbur pocketing the papers
The pair ascended to the deck
The burial of Captain Sternersen was a dreadful business
Kitchell far gone in whiskey stood on the house issuing his orders drinking from one of the decanters he had brought up with him
He had already rifled the dead mans pockets and had even taken away the boots and furlined cap
Cloths were cut from the spanker and rolled around the body
Then Kitchell ordered the peak halyards unrove and used as lashings to tie the canvas around the corpse
The red and white flags the distress signals were still bound on the halyards
Leave em on
Leave em on commanded Kitchell
Use m as a shrou
All ready now stan by to let her go
Wilbur looked over at the schooner and noted with immense relief that Moran was not in sight
Suddenly an abrupt reaction took place in the Captains addled brain
Cant bury um ithout is teeth he gabbled solemnly
He laid back the canvas and replaced the set
Ole mand hant me f I kep s teeth
Strike
look a that I put em in upside down
Nev min upsi down downsi up whaz odds all same with ole Bill hey ole Bill all same with you hey
Suddenly he began to howl with laughter T think a bein buried with yr teeth upsi down
Oh mee but thats a good grind
Stan by to heave ole Uncle Bill overready heave an away she goes
He ran to the side waving his hat and looking over
Gooby ole Bill byby
There you go an the signal o distress roun you H B
Im in need of assistance
Lord here comes the sharkslook
look
look at um fight
look at um takin ole Bill
Im in need of assistance
I shd say you were ole Bill
Wilbur looked once over the side in the churning lashing water then drew back sick to vomiting
But in less than thirty seconds the water was quiet
Not a shark was in sight
Get over t the Bertha with those papers son ordered Kitchell Ill bide here and dig up sh mor loot
Ill gut this ole pillbox from stern to stempost fore Ill leave
I wont leave a copper rivet in er notta coer rivet dyhear
he shouted his face purple with unnecessary rage
Wilbur returned to the schooner with the two Chinamen leaving Kitchell alone on the bark
He found the girl sitting by the rudderhead almost as he had left her looking about her with vague unseeing eyes
You name is Moran isnt it
he asked
Moran Sternersen
Yes she said after a pause then looked curiously at a bit of tarred rope on the deck
Nothing more could be got out of her
Wilbur talked to her at length and tried to make her understand the situation but it was evident she did not follow
However at each mention of her name she would answer Yes yes Im Moran
Wilbur turned away from her biting his nether lip in perplexity
Now what am I going to do
he muttered
What a situation
If I tell the Captain its all up with the girl
If he didnt kill her hed do worsemight do both
If I dont tell him there goes her birthright 60000 and she alone in the world
Its begun to go already he added listening to the sounds that came from the bark
Kitchell was raging to and fro in the cabin in a frenzy of drink axe in hand smashing glassware hacking into the woodwork singing the while at the top of his voice As through the drop I go drop I go As through the drop I go drop I go As through the drop I go Down to hell that yawns below Twenty stiffs all in a row Damn your eyes Thats the kind of man I have to deal with muttered Wilbur
Its encouraging and theres no one to talk to
Not much help in a Chinaman and a crazy girl in a mans oilskins
Its about the biggest situation you ever faced Ross Wilbur and youre all alone
What the devil are you going to do
He acknowledged with considerable humiliation that he could not get the better of Kitchell either physically or mentally
Kitchell was a more powerful man than he and cleverer
The Captain was in his element now and he was the commander
On shore it would have been vastly different
The citybred fellow with a policeman always in call would have known how to act
I simply cant stand by and see that hog plundering everything shes got
Whats to be done
And suddenly while the words were yet in his mouth the sun was wiped from the sky like writing from a slate the horizon blackened vanished a long white line of froth whipped across the sea and came on hissing
A hollow note boomed out boomed swelled and grew rapidly to a roar
An icy chill stabbed the air
Then the squall swooped and struck and the sky shut down over the troubled ocean like a potlid over a boiling pot
The schooners fore and main sheets that had not been made fast unrove at the first gust and began to slat wildly in the wind
The Chinamen cowered to the decks grasping at cleats stays and masts
They were helplessparalyzed with fear
Charlie clung to a stay one arm over his head as though dodging a blow
Wilbur gripped the rail with his hands where he stood his teeth set his eyes wide waiting for the foundering of the schooner his only thought being that the end could not be far
He had heard of the suddenness of tropical squalls but this had come with the abruptness of a sceneshift at a play
The schooner veered broadon to the waves
It was the beginning of the endanother roll to the leeward like the last and the Pacific would come aboard
And you call yourselves sailor men
Are you going to drown like rats on a plank
A voice that Wilbur did not know went ringing through that horrid shouting of wind and sea like the call of a bugle
He turned to see Moran the girl of the Lady Letty standing erect upon the quarterdeck holding down the schooners wheel
The confusion of that dreadful moment that had paralyzed the crews senses had brought back hers
She was herself again savage splendid dominant superb in her wrath at their weakness their cowardice
Her heavy brows were knotted over her flaming eyes her hat was gone and her thick bands of yellow hair whipped across her face and streamed out in the wind like streamers of the northern lights
As she shouted gesturing furiously to the men the loose sleeve of the oilskin coat fell back and showed her forearm strong round and white as scud the hand and wrist so tanned as to look almost like a glove
And all the while she shouted aloud furious with indignation raging against the supineness of the Berthas crew
Stand by men
stand by
Look alive now
Make fast the staysl halyards to the dorys warp
Now then unreeve yr halyards
all clear there
pass the end ford outside the rigging
outside
you fools
Make fast to the bits forardlet go yr linethatll do
Sohsoh
There shes coming up
The dory had been towing astern and the seas combing over her had swamped her
Moran had been inspired to use the swamped boat as a seaanchor fastening her to the schooners bow instead of to the stern
The Berthas bow answering to the drag veered around
The Bertha stood head to the seas riding out the squall
It was a masterpiece of seamanship conceived and executed in the very thick of peril and it saved the schooner
But there was little time to think of themselves
On board the bark the sails were still set
The squall struck the Lady Letty squarely aback
She heeled over upon the instant then as the top hamper carried away with a crash eased back a moment upon an even keel
But her cargo had shifted
The bark was doomed
Through the flying spray and scud and rain Wilbur had a momentary glimpse of Kitchell hacking at the lanyards with his axe
Then the Lady Letty capsized going over till her masts were flat with the water and in another second rolled bottom up
For a moment her keel and red iron bottom were visible through the mist of driving spoondrift
Suddenly they sank from sight
She was gone
And then like the rolling up of a scroll the squall passed the sun returned the sky burned back to blue the ruggedness was smoothed from the ocean and the warmth of the tropics closed around the Bertha Millner once more rolling easily on the swell of the ocean
Of the Lady Letty and the drunken beachcombing Captain not a trace remained
Kitchell had gone down with his prize
The Bertha Millners Chinese crew huddled forward talking wildly pointing and looking in a bewildered fashion over the sides
Wilbur and Moran were left alone on the open Pacific
V A Girl Captain When Wilbur came on deck the morning after the sinking of the bark he was surprised to find the schooner under way again
Wilbur and Charlie had berthed forward during that nightCharlie with the hands Wilbur in the Captains hammock
The reason for this change of quarters had been found in a peremptory order from Moran during the dogwatch the preceding evening
She had looked squarely at Wilbur from under her scowl and had said briefly and in a fine contralto voice that he had for the first time noted I berth aft in the cabin you and the Chinaman forward
Understand
Moran had only forestalled Wilburs intention while after her almost miraculous piece of seamanship in the rescue of the schooner Charlie and the Chinese crew accorded her a respect that was almost superstitious
Wilbur met her again at breakfast
She was still wearing mens clothingpart of Kitchells outfitand was booted to the knee but now she wore no hat and her enormous mane of ryecolored hair was braided into long strands near to the thickness of a mans arm
The redness of her face gave a startling effect to her pale blue eyes and sandy heavy eyebrows that easily lowered to a frown
She ate with her knife and after pushing away her plate Wilbur observed that she drank half a tumbler of whiskey and water
The conversation between the two was tame enough
There was no common ground upon which they could meet
To her fathers death no doubt an old matter even before her rescueshe made no allusion
Her attitude toward Wilbur was one of defiance and suspicion
Only once did she relax How did you come to be aboard here with these rateatersyoure no sailor
she said abruptly
Huh
laughed Wilbur mirthlessly huh
I was shanghaied
Moran smote the table with a red fist and shouted with sonorous belltoned laughter
Shanghaiedyou
Now that is really good
And what are you going to do now
What are you going to do
Signal the first homebound vessel and be taken into Frisco
Ive my insurance to collect Wilbur had given her the Lettys papers and the disaster to report
Well Im not keen on sharkhunting myself said Wilbur
But Moran showed no interest in his plans
However they soon found that they were not to be permitted to signal
At noon the same day the schooner sighted a steamships smoke on the horizon and began to raise her rapidly
Moran immediately bound on the ensign union down and broke it out at the peak
Charlie who was at the wheel spoke a sentence in Chinese and one of the hands drew his knife across the halyards and brought the distress signal to the deck
Moran turned upon Charlie with an oath her brows knitted
No
No
sang Charlie closing his eyes and wagging his head
No
Too muchee los time no can stop
You come downside cabin you an onepiece boss number two this was Wilbur have um chin chin
The odd conclave assembled about Kitchells tablethe clubman the halfmasculine girl in mens clothes and the Chinaman
The conference was an angry one Wilbur and Moran insisting that they be put aboard the steamship Charlie refusing with calm obstinacy
I have um chinchin with China boys las nigh
China boy heap flaid no can stop um steamship
Heap flaid too much talkee talkee
No stop go fish now go fish chopchop
Los heap time go fish
I no savvy sail um boat China boy no savvy sail um boat
I tink um you savvy and he pointed to Moran
I tink um you savvy plenty heap much disa bay
Boss number two him no savvy sail um boat but him savvy plenty many all same
And were to stop on board your doughdish and navigate her for you
shouted Moran her face blazing
Charlie nodded blandly I tink um yass
And when we get back to port exclaimed Wilbur you think perhaps Iwe wont make it interesting for you
Charlie smiled
I tink um Six Company heap rich
Well get along ordered Moran as though the schooner was her property and well talk it over
China boy like you heap pretty big said Charlie to Moran as he went out
You savvy sail um boat all light wanta you fo captain
But he added suddenly dropping his bland passivity as though he wore a mask and for an instant allowing the wicked malevolent Cantonese to come to the surface China boy no likee funnee business savvy
Then with a smile of a Talleyrand he disappeared
Moran and Wilbur were helpless for the present
They were but two against seven Chinamen
They must stay on board if the coolies wished it and if they were to stay it was a matter of their own personal safety that the Bertha Millner should be properly navigated
Ill captain her concluded Moran sullenly at the end of their talk
You must act as mate Mr Wilbur
And dont get any mistaken idea into your head that because Im a young girl and alone you are going to run things your way
I dont like funny business any better than Charlie
Look here said Wilbur complaining dont think Im altogether a villain
I think youre a ripping fine girl
Youre different from any kind of girl I ever met of course but you by jingo youreyoure splendid
There in the squall last evening when you stood at the wheel with your hair Oh drop that
said the girl contemptuously and went up on deck
Wilbur followed scratching an ear
Charlie was called aft and their decision announced
Moran would navigate the Bertha Millner Wilbur and she taking the watches
Charlie promised that he would answer for the obedience of the men
Their first concern now was to shape their course for Magdalena Bay
Moran and Wilbur looked over Kitchells charts and logbook but the girl flung them aside disdainfully
Hes been sailing by the dead reckoning and his navigation is drivel
Why a cabinboy would know better and to end with the chronometer is run down
Ill have to get Greenich time by taking the altitude of a star tonight and figure out our longitude
Did you bring off our sextant
Wilbur shook his head
Only the papers he said
Theres only an old ebony quadrant here said Moran but it will have to do
That night lying flat on her back on the deck with a quadrant to her eye she got a star and brought it down to the horizon and sat up under the reeking lamp in the cabin nearly the whole night ciphering and ciphering till she had filled up the four sides of the logslate with her calculations
However by daylight she had obtained the correct Greenwich time and worked the schooners longitude
Two days passed then a third
Moran set the schooners course
She kept almost entirely to herself and when not at the wheel or taking the sun or writing up the log gloomed over the afterrail into the schooners wake
Wilbur knew not what to think of her
Never in his life had he met with any girl like this
So accustomed had she been to the rough giveandtake direct associations of a seafaring life that she misinterpreted well meant politenessthe only respect he knew how to pay herto mean insidious advances
She was suspicious of himdistrusted him utterly and openly ridiculed his abortive seamanship
Pretty she was not but she soon began to have a certain amount of attraction for Wilbur
He liked her splendid ropes of hair her heavy contralto voice her fine animal strength of bone and muscle admittedly greater than his own he admired her indomitable courage and selfreliance while her positive genius in the matters of seamanship and navigation filled him with speechless wonder
The girls he had been used to were clever only in their knowledge of the amenities of an afternoon call or the formalities of a paper german
A girl of twoandtwenty who could calculate longitude from the altitude of a star was outside his experience
The more he saw of her the more he knew himself to have been right in his first estimate
She drank whiskey after her meals and when angry which was often swore like a buccaneer
As yet she was almost as one might say without sexsavage unconquered untamed glorying in her own independence her sullen isolation
Her neck was thick strong and very white her hands roughened and calloused
In her mens clothes she looked tall vigorous and unrestrained and on more than one occasion as Wilbur passed close to her he was made aware that her hair her neck her entire personality exhaled a fine sweet natural redolence that savored of the ocean and great winds
One day as he saw her handling a huge waterbarrel by the chines only with a strength he knew to be greater than his own her brows contracted with the effort her hair curling about her thick neck her large round arms bare to the elbow a sudden thrill of enthusiasm smote through him and between his teeth he exclaimed to himself By Jove youre a woman
The Bertha Millner continued to the southward gliding quietly over the oilsmoothness of the ocean under airs so light as hardly to ruffle the surface
Sometimes at high noon the shimmer of the ocean floor blended into the shimmer of the sky at the horizon and then it was no longer water and blue heavens the little craft seemed to be poised in a vast crystalline sphere where there was neither height nor depthpoised motionless in warm coruscating opalescent space alone with the sun
At length one morning the schooner which for the preceding twentyfour hours had been heading eastward raised the land and by the middle of the afternoon had come up to within a mile of a low sandy shore quivering with heat and had tied up to the kelp in Magdalena Bay
Charlie now took over entire charge of operations
For two days previous the Chinese hands had been getting out the decktubs tackles gaffs spades and the other sharkfishing gear that had been stowed forward
The sails were lowered and gasketed the decks cleared of all impedimenta hogsheads and huge vats stood ready in the waist and the lazy indolence of the previous week was replaced by an extraordinary activity
The day after their arrival in the bay was occupied by all hands in catching bait
This bait was a kind of rockfish of a beautiful red gold color and about the size of an ordinary cod
They bit readily enough but out of every ten hooked three were taken off the lines by the sharks before they could be brought aboard
Another difficulty lay in the fact that either because of the excessive heat in the air or the percentage of alkali in the water they spoiled almost immediately if left in the air
Turtle were everywherefloating graygreen disks just under the surface
Seabirds in clouds clamored all day long about the shore and sandpits
At long intervals flyingfish skittered over the water like skippingstones
Shoals of porpoises came in from outside leaping clumsily along the edges of the kelp
Bewildered landbirds perched on the schooners rigging and in the early morning the whistling of quail could be heard on shore near where a little freshwater stream ran down to meet the ocean
It was Wilbur who caught the first shark on the second morning of the Berthas advent in Magdalena Bay
A store of bait had been accumulated split and halved into chunks for the sharkhooks and Wilbur baiting one of the huge lines that had been brought up on deck the evening before flung it overboard and watched the glimmer of the white fishmeat turning to a silvery green as it sank down among the kelp
Almost instantly a long moving shadow just darker than the bluegreen mass of the water identified itself at a little distance
Enormous flukes proceeded from either side an erect dorsal fin like an enormous cocks crest rose from the back while immediately over the head swam the two pilotfish following so closely the movement of the shark as to give the impression of actually adhering to his body
Twice and three times the great maneater twelve feet from snout to tailtip circled slowly about the bait the flukes moving fanlike through the water
Once he came up touched the bait with his nose and backed easily away
He disappeared returned and poised himself motionless in the schooners shadow feeling the water with his flukes
Moran was looking over Wilburs shoulder
Hes as good as caught she muttered once let them get sight of meat and Steady now
The shark moved forward
Suddenly with a long easy roll he turned completely upon his back
His white belly flashed like silver in the waterthe bait disappeared
Youve got him
shouted Moran
The rope slid through Wilburs palms burning the skin as the huge seawolf sounded
Moran laid hold
The heavy sullen wrenching from below twitched and swayed their bodies and threw them against each other
Her bare cool arm was pressed close over his knuckles
Heave
she cried laughing with the excitement of the moment
Heave all
she began the chant of sailors hauling at the ropes
Together and bracing their feet against the schooners rail they fought out the fight with the great fish
In a swirl of lather the head and shoulders came above the surface the flukes churning the water till it boiled like the wake of a screw steamship
But as soon as these great fins were clear of the surface the shark fell quiet and helpless
Charlie came up with the cuttingin spade and as the fish hung still over the side cut him open from neck to belly with a single movement
Another Chinaman stood by with a longhandled gaff hooked out the purpleblack liver brought it over the side and dropped it into one of the decktubs
The shark thrashed and writhed his flukes quivering and his gills distended
Wilbur could not restrain an exclamation
Brutal business
he muttered
Hoh
exclaimed Moran scornfully cuttingin is too good for him
Sailorfolk are no friends of such carrion as that
Other lines were baited and dropped overboard and the hands settled themselves to the real business of the expedition
There was no skill in the matter
The sharks bit ravenously and soon swarmed about the schooner in hundreds
Hardly a half minute passed that one of the four Chinamen that were fishing did not signal a catch and Charlie and Jim were kept busy with spade and gaff
By noon the decktubs were full
The lines were hauled in and the hands set the tubs in the sun to try out the oil
Under the tropical heat the shark livers almost visibly melted away and by four oclock in the afternoon the tubs were full of a thick yellow oil the reek of which instantly recalled to Wilburs mind the rancid smell of the schooner on the day when he had first come aboard of her
The decktubs were emptied into the hogsheads and vats that stood in the waist of the Bertha the tubs scoured and the lines and bent sharkhooks overhauled
Charlie disappeared in the galley supper was cooked and eaten upon deck under the conflagration of the sunset the lights were set the Chinamen foregathered in the focstle head smoking opium and by eight oclock the routine of the day was at an end
So the time passed
In a short time Wilbur could not have said whether the day was Wednesday or Sunday
He soon tired of the unsportsmanlike work of killing the sluggish brutes and turned shoreward to relieve the monotony of the succeeding days
He and Moran were left a good deal to their own devices
Charlie was the master of the men now
Mate said Moran to Wilbur one day after a dinner of turtle steaks and fish eaten in the open air on the quarterdeck mate this is slow work and the schooner smells terribly foul
Well have the dory out and go ashore
We can tumble a cask into her and get some water
The butts three quarters empty
Lets see how it feels to be in Mexico
Mexico
said Wilbur
Thats soLower California is Mexico
Id forgotten that
They went ashore and spent the afternoon in filling the watercask from the freshwater stream and in gathering abalones which Moran declared were delicious eating from the rocks left bare by the tide
But nothing could have exceeded the loneliness of that shore and backland palpitating under the flogging of a tropical sun
Low hills of sand covered with brush stretched back from the shore
On the eastern horizon leagues distant blue masses of mountain striated with mirages swam in the scorching air
The sand was like fire to the touch
Far out in the bay the schooner hung motionless under bare sticks resting apparently upon her inverted shadow only
And that was allthe flat heat ridden land the sheen of the open Pacific and the lonely schooner
Quiet enough said Wilbur in a low voice wondering if there was such a place as San Francisco with its paved streets and cable cars and if people who had been his friends there had ever had any real existence
Do you like it
asked Moran quickly facing him her thumbs in her belt
Its good funhow about you
Its no different than the only life Ive known
I suppose you think it s a queer kind of life for a girl
Ive lived by doing things not by thinking things or reading about what other people have done or thought and I guess its what you do that counts rather than what you think or read about
Wheres that pinchbar
Well get a couple more abalones for supper and then put off
That was the only talk of moment they had during the afternoon
All the rest of their conversation had been of those things that immediately occupied their attention
They regained the schooner toward five oclock to find the Chinamen perplexed and mystified
No explanation was forthcoming and Charlie gave them supper in preoccupied silence
As they were eating the abalones which Moran had fried in batter Charlie said Shark all gone
No more catch umhim all gone
Gonewhy
No savvy said Charlie
No likee no likee
China boy tink um heap funny too much heap funny
It was true
During all the next day not a shark was in sight and though the crew fished assiduously till dark they were rewarded by not so much as a bite
No one could offer any explanation
Tis strange said Moran
Never heard of shark leaving this feed before
And you can see with half an eye that the hands dont like the looks of it
Superstitious beggars
they need to be clumped in the head
That same night Wilbur woke in his hammock on the focstle head about halfpast two
The moon was down the sky one powder of stars
There was not a breath of wind
It was so still that he could hear some large fish playing and breaking off toward the shore
Then without the least warning he felt the schooner begin to lift under him
He rolled out of his hammock and stood on the deck
There could be no doubt of itthe whole forepart was rising beneath him
He could see the bowsprit moving upward from star to star
Still the schooner lifted objects on deck began to slide aft the oil in the decktubs washed over then as there came a wild scrambling of the Chinese crew up the focstle hatch she settled again gradually at first then with an abrupt lurch that almost threw him from his feet regained her level
Moran met him in the waist
Charlie came running aft
What was that
Are we grounding
Has she struck
No no were still fast to the kelp
Was it a tidal wave
Nonsense
It wouldnt have handled us that way
Well what was it
Listen
For Gods sake keep quiet there forward
Wilbur looked over the side into the water
The ripples were still chasing themselves away from the schooner
There was nothing else
The stillness shut down again
There was not a sound
VI A SEA MYSTERY In spite of his best efforts at selfcontrol Wilbur felt a slow cold clutch at his heart
That sickening uncanny lifting of the schooner out of the glassy water at a time when there was not enough wind to so much as wrinkle the surface sent a creep of something very like horror through all his flesh
Again he peered over the side down into the kelpthickened sea
Nothingnot a breath of air was stirring
The gray light that flooded down from the stars showed not a break upon the surface of Magdalena Bay
On shore nothing moved
Quiet there forward called Moran to the shrillvoiced coolies
The succeeding stillness was profound
All on board listened intently
The water dripped like the ticking of a clock from the Bertha Millners stern which with the rising of the bow had sunk almost to the rail
There was no other sound
Strange muttered Moran her brows contracting
Charlie broke the silence with a wail No likee no likee
he cried at top voice
The man had gone suddenly green Wilbur could see the shine of his eyes distended like those of a harassed cat
As he Moran and Wilbur stood in the schooners waist staring at each other the smell of punk came to their nostrils
Forward the coolies were already burning josssticks on the focastle head kowtowing their foreheads to the deck
Moran went forward and kicked them to their feet and hurled their josssticks into the sea
Feng shui
Feng shui
they exclaimed with bated breaths
The Feng shui no likee we
Low in the east the horizon began to blacken against the sky
It was early morning
A watch was set the Chinamen sent below and until daybreak when Charlie began to make a clattering of tins in the galley as he set about preparing breakfast Wilbur paced the rounds of the schooner looking listening and waiting again for that slow horrifying lift
But the rest of the night was without incident
After breakfast the strangely assorted trioCharlie Moran and Wilburheld another conference in the cabin
It was decided to move the schooner to the other side of the bay
Feng shui in disa place no likee we announced Charlie
Feng shui who are they
Charlie promptly became incoherent on this subject and Moran and Wilbur could only guess that the Feng shui were the tutelary deities that presided over that portion of Magdalena Bay
At any rate there were evidently no more shark to be caught in that fishingground so sail was made and by noon the Bertha Millner tied up to the kelp on the opposite side of the inlet about half a mile from the shore
The shark were plentiful here and the fishing went forward again as before
Certain of these shark were hauled aboard stunned by a blow on the nose and their fins cut off
The Chinamen packed these fins away in separate kegs
Eventually they would be sent to China
Two or three days passed
The hands kept steadily at their work
Nothing more occurred to disturb the monotony of the scorching days and soundless nights the schooner sat as easily on the unbroken water as though built to the bottom
Soon the night watch was discontinued
During these days the three officers lived high
Turtle were plentiful and what with their steaks and soups the fried abalones the seafish the really delicious sharkfins and the quail that Charlie and Wilbur trapped along the shore the trio had nothing to wish for in the way of table luxuries
The shore was absolutely deserted as well as the back countryan unbroken wilderness of sand and sage
Half a dozen times Wilbur wearying of his inaction aboard the schooner made the entire circuit of the bay from point to point
Standing on one of the latter projections and looking out to the west the Pacific appeared as empty of life as the land
Never a keel cut those waters never a sail broke the edge of the horizon never a feather of smoke spotted the sky where it whitened to meet the sea
Everything was emptyvast unspeakably desolate palpitating with heat
Another week passed
Charlie began to complain that the shark were growing scarce again
I think bimeby him go away once a mo
That same night Wilbur lying in his hammock was awakened by a touch on his arm
He woke to see Moran beside him on the deck
Did you hear anything
she said in a low voice looking at him under her scowl
No
no
he exclaimed getting up reaching for his wicker sandals
Did you
I thought sosomething
Did you feel anything
Ive been asleep I havent noticed anything
Is it beginning again
The schooner lifted again just now very gently
I happened to be awake or I wouldnt have noticed it
They were talking in low voices as is the custom of people speaking in the dark
There whats that
exclaimed Wilbur under his breath
A gentle vibration barely perceptible thrilled through the schooner
Under his hand that was clasped upon the rail Wilbur could feel a faint trembling in her frame
It stopped began again and died slowly away
Well what the devil IS it
he muttered impatiently trying to master the returning creep of dread
Moran shook her head biting her lip
Its beyond me she said frowning
Can you see anything
The sky sea and land were unbroken reaches of solitude
There was no breath of wind
Listen said Moran
Far off to landward came the faint sleepy clucking of a quail and the stridulating of unnumbered crickets a long ripple licked the slope of the beach and slid back into the ocean
Wilbur shook his head
Dont hear anything he whispered
Shthereshes trembling again
Once more a prolonged but faint quivering ran through the Bertha Millner from stem to stern and from keel to masthead
There was a barely audible creaking of joints and panels
The oil in the decktubs trembled
The vibration was so fine and rapid that it tickled the soles of Wilburs feet as he stood on the deck
Id give two fingers to know what it all means murmured Moran in a low voice
Ive been to sea for Then suddenly she cried aloud Steady all shes lifting again
The schooner heaved slowly under them this time by the stern
Up she went up and up while Wilbur gripped at a stay to keep his place and tried to choke down his heart that seemed to beat against his palate
God
ejaculated Moran her eyes blazing
This thing is The Bertha came suddenly down to an easy keel rocking in that glassy sea as if in a tide rip
The deck was awash with oil
Far out in the bay the ripples widening from the schooner blurred the reflections of the stars
The Chinamen swarmed up the hatchway voluble and shrill
Again the Bertha Millner lifted and sank the tubs sliding on the deck the masts quivering like reeds the timbers groaning aloud with the strain
In the stern something cracked and smashed
Then the trouble died away the ripples faded into the ocean and the schooner settled to her keel quite motionless
Look said Moran her face toward the Berthas stern
The rudder is out of the gudgeons
It was truethe Bertha Millners helm was unshipped
There was no more sleep for any one on board that night
Wilbur tramped the quarterdeck sick with a feeling he dared not put a name to
Moran sat by the wrecked rudderhead a useless pistol in her hand swearing under her breath from time to time
Charlie appeared on the quarterdeck at intervals looked at Wilbur and Moran with wideopen eyes and then took himself away
On the forward deck the coolies pasted strips of red paper inscribed with mottoes upon the mast and filled the air with the reek of their josssticks
If one could only SEE what it was growled Moran between her clinched teeth
But thisthis damned heaving and trembling it its queer
Thats it thats it said Wilbur quickly facing her
What are we going to do Moran
STICK IT OUT
she exclaimed striking her knee with her fist
We cant leave the schoonerI WONT leave her
Ill stay by this doughdish as long as two planks in her hold together
Were you thinking of cutting away
She fixed him with her frown
Wilbur looked at her sitting erect by the disabled rudder her head bare her braids of yellow hair hanging over her breast sitting there in mans clothes and mans boots the pistol at her side
He shook his head
Im not leaving the Bertha till you do he answered adding Ill stand by you mate until we Feel that
said Moran holding up a hand
A fine quivering tremble was thrilling through every beam of the schooner vibrating each rope like a harpstring
It passed away but before either Wilbur or Moran could comment upon it recommenced this time much more perceptibly
Charlie dashed aft his queue flying
Wat makum heap shake
he shouted wat for him shake
No savvy no likee pretty much heap flaid aieyah aieyah
Slowly the schooner heaved up as though upon the crest of some huge wave slowly it settled and again gradually lifted till Wilbur had to catch at the rail to steady his footing
The quivering sensation increased so that their very teeth chattered with it
Below in the cabin they could hear small objects falling from the shelves and table
Then with a sudden drop the Bertha fell back to her keel again the spilled oil spouting from her scuppers the masts rocking the water churning and splashing from her sides
And that was all
There was no soundnothing was in sight
There was only the frightened trembling of the little schooner and that long slow heave and lift
Morning came and breakfast was had in silence and grim perplexity
It was too late to think of getting away now that the rudder was disabled
The Bertha Millner must bide where she was
And a little more of this dancing exclaimed Moran and well have the planks springing off the sternpost
Charlie nodded solemnly
He said nothinghis gravity had returned
Now in the glare of the tropical day with the Bertha Millner sitting the sea as placidly as a brooding gull he was Talleyrand again
I tinkum yas he said vaguely
Well I think we had better try and fix the rudder and put back to Frisco said Moran
Youre making no money this way
There are no shark to be caught
SOMETHINGS wrong
Theyre gone away somewhere
The crew are eating their heads off and not earning enough money to pay for their keep
What do you think
I tinkum yas
Then well go home
Is that it
I tinkum yastomolla
Tomorrow
Yas
Thats settled then persisted Moran surprised at his ready acquiescence we start home tomorrow
Charlie nodded
Tomolla he said
The rudder was not so badly damaged as they had at first supposed the break was easily mended but it was found necessary for one of the men to go over the side
Get over the side here Jim commanded Moran
Charlie tell him whats wanted we cant work the pintle in from the deck
But Charlie shook his head
Him no likee go him plenty much flaid
Moran ripped out an oath
What do I care if hes afraid
I want him to shove the pintle into the lower gudgeon
My God she exclaimed with immense contempt what carrion
Id sooner work a boat with shemonkeys
Mr Wilbur I shall have to ask you to go over
I thought I was captain here but it all depends on whether these rats are afraid or not
Plenty many shark expostulated Charlie
Him flaid shark come back catchum chopchop
Stand by here with a couple of cuttingin spades cried Moran and fend off if you see any shark now then are you ready mate
Wilbur took his determination in both hands threw off his coat and sandals and went over the stern rail
Put your ear to the water called Moran from above sometimes you can hear their flukes
It took but a minute to adjust the pintle and Wilbur regained the deck again dripping and a little pale
He knew not what horrid form of death might have been lurking for him down below there underneath the kelp
As he started forward for dry clothes he was surprised to observe that Moran was smiling at him holding out her hand
That was well done she said and thank you
Ive seen older sailormen than you who wouldnt have taken the risk
Never before had she appeared more splendid in his eyes than at this moment
After changing his clothes in the focastle he sat for a long time his chin in his hands very thoughtful
Then at length as though voicing the conclusion of his reflections said aloud as he rose to his feet But of course THAT is out of the question
He remembered that they were going home on the next day
Within a fortnight he would be in San Francisco againa taxpayer a policeprotected citizen once more
It had been good fun after all this three weeks life on the Bertha Millner a strange episode cut out from the normal circle of his conventional life
He ran over the incidents of the cruiseKitchell the turtle hunt the finding of the derelict the dead captain the squall and the awful sight of the sinking bark Moran at the wheel the grewsome business of the sharkfishing and last of all that inexplicable lifting and quivering of the schooner
He told himself that now he would probably never know the explanation of that mystery
The day passed in preparations to put to sea again
The decktubs and hogsheads were stowed below and the tackle cleared away
By evening all was ready they would be under way by daybreak the next morning
There was a possibility of their being forced to tow the schooner out by means of the dory so light were the airs inside
Once beyond the heads however they were sure of a breeze
About ten oclock that night the same uncanny trembling ran through the schooner again and about half an hour later she lifted gently once or twice
But after that she was undisturbed
Later on in the nightor rather early in the morningWilbur woke suddenly in his hammock without knowing why and got up and stood listening
The Bertha Millner was absolutely quiet
The night was hot and still the new moon canted over like a sinking galleon was low over the horizon
Wilbur listened intently for now at last he heard something
Between the schooner and the shore a gentle sound of splashing came to his ears and an occasional crack as of oars in their locks
Was it possible that a boat was there between the schooner and the land
What boat and manned by whom
The creaking of oarlocks and the dip of paddles was unmistakable
Suddenly Wilbur raised his voice in a great shout Boat ahoy
There was no answer the noise of oars grew fainter
Moran came running out of her cabin swinging into her coat as she ran
What is itwhat is it
A boat I think right off the schooner here
Harktheredid you hear the oars
Youre right call the hands get the dory over well follow that boat right up
Hello forward there Charlie all hands tumble out
Then Wilbur and Moran caught themselves looking into each others eyes
At once somethingperhaps the latent silence of the schoonertold them there was to be no answer
The two ran for ward Moran swung herself into the focastle hatch and without using the ladder dropped to the deck below
In an instant her voice came up the hatch The bunks are emptytheyre goneabandoned us
She came up the ladder again
Look said Wilbur as she regained the deck
The dorys gone theyve taken it
It was our only boat we cant get ashore
Cowardly superstitious rats I should have expected this
They would be chopped in bits before they would stay longer on board this boatthey and theirFeng shui
When morning came the deserters could be made out camped on the shore near to the beached dory
What their intentions were could not be conjectured
Ridden with all manner of nameless Oriental superstitions it was evident that the Chinamen preferred any hazard of fortune to remaining longer upon the schooner
Well can we get along without them
said Wilbur
Can we two work the schooner back to port ourselves
Well try it on anyhow mate said Moran we might get her into San Diego anyhow
The Chinamen had left plenty of provisions on board and Moran cooked breakfast
Fortunately by eight oclock a very light westerly breeze came up
Moran and Wilbur cast off the gaskets and set the fore and main sails
Wilbur was busy at the forward bitts preparing to cast loose from the kelp and Moran had taken up her position at the wheel when suddenly she exclaimed Sail hoand in Gods name what kind of a sail do you call it
In fact a strangelooking craft had just made her appearance at the entrance of Magdalena Bay
VII BEACHCOMBERS Wilbur returned aft and joined Moran on the quarterdeck
She was already studying the stranger through the glass
Thats a new build of boat to me she muttered giving Wilbur the glass
Wilbur looked long and carefully
The newcomer was of the size and much the same shape as a caravel of the fifteenth centuryhigh as to bow and stern and to all appearances as seaworthy as a souptureen
Never but in the old prints had Wilbur seen such an extraordinary boat
She carried a single mast which listed forward her lugsail was stretched upon dozens of bamboo yards she drew hardly any water
Two enormous red eyes were painted upon either side of her high blunt bow while just abaft the waist projected an enormous oar or sweep full forty feet in lengthlonger in fact than the vessel herself
It acted partly as a propeller partly as a rudder
Theyre heading for us commented Wilbur as Moran took the glass again
Right she answered adding upon the moment Huh
more Chinamen the thing is alive with coolies shes a junk
Oh
exclaimed Wilbur recollecting some talk of Charlies he had overheard
I know
You know
Yes these are real beachcombers
Ive heard of them along this coastheard our Chinamen speak of them
They beach that junk every night and camp on shore
Theyre scavengers as you might saypick up what they can find or plunder along shoreabalones sharkfins pickings of wrecks old brass and copper seals perhaps turtle and shell
Between whiles they fish for shrimp and Ive heard Kitchell tell how they make pearls by dropping birdshot into oysters
They are Kaigingh to a man and according to Kitchell the wickedest breed of cats that ever cut teeth
The junk bore slowly down upon the schooner
In a few moments she had hove to alongside
But for the enormous red eyes upon her bow she was innocent of paint
She was grimed and shellacked with dirt and grease and smelled abominably
Her crew were Chinamen but such Chinamen
The coolies of the Bertha Millner were pampered and effete in comparison
The beachcombers thirteen in number were a smaller class of men their faces almost black with tan and dirt
Though they still wore the queue their heads were not shaven and mats and mops of stiff black hair fell over their eyes from under their broad basketshaped hats
They were barefoot
None of them wore more than two garmentsthe jeans and the blouse
They were the lowest type of men Wilbur had ever seen
The faces were those of a higher order of anthropoid apes the lower portionjaws lips and teethsalient the nostrils opening at almost right angles the eyes tiny and bright the forehead seamed and wrinkledunnaturally old
Their general expression was of simian cunning and a ferocity that was utterly devoid of courage
Aye
exclaimed Moran between her teeth if the devil were a shepherd here are his sheep
You dont come aboard this schooner my friends
I want to live as long as I can and die when I cant help it
Boat ahoy
she called
An answer in Cantonese singsong came back from the junk and the speaker gestured toward the outside ocean
Then a long parleying began
For upward of half an hour Moran and Wilbur listened to a proposition in broken pigeon English made by the beachcombers again and again and yet again and were in no way enlightened
It was impossible to understand
Then at last they made out that there was question of a whale
Next it appeared the whale was dead and finally after a prolonged pantomime of gesturing and pointing Moran guessed that the beach combers wanted the use of the Bertha Millner to trice up the dead leviathan while the oil and whalebone were extracted
That must be it she said to Wilbur
Thats what they mean by pointing to our masts and tackle
You see they couldnt manage with that stick of theirs and they say theyll give us a third of the loot
Well do it mate and Ill tell you why
The wind has fallen and they can tow us out
If its a spermwhale theyve found there ought to be thirty or forty barrels of oil in him let alone the blubber and bone
Oil is at 50 now and spermaceti will always bring 100
Well take it on mate
but well keep our eyes on the rats all the time
I dont want them aboard at all
Look at their belts
Not three out of the dozen who arent carrying those filthy little hatchets
Faugh
she exclaimed with a shudder of disgust
Such vipers
What followed proved that Moran had guessed correctly
A rope was passed to the Bertha Millner the junk put out its sweeps and to a wailing eldrich chanting the schooner was towed out of the bay
I wonder what Charlie and our China boys will think of this
said Wilbur looking shoreward where the deserters could be seen gathered together in a silent observing group
Were well shut of them growled Moran her thumbs in her belt
Only now well never know what was the matter with the schooner these last few nights
Hah
she exclaimed under her breath her scowl thickening sometimes I dont wonder the beasts cut
The dead whale was lying four miles out of the entrance of Magdalena Bay and as the junk and the schooner drew near seemed like a huge black boat floating bottom up
Over it and upon it swarmed and clambered thousands of seabirds while all around and below the water was thick with gorging sharks
A dreadful strangling decay fouled all the air
The whale was a spermwhale and fully twice the length of the Bertha Millner
The work of tricing him up occupied the beach combers throughout the entire day
It was out of the question to keep them off the schooner and Wilbur and Moran were too wise to try
They swarmed the forward deck and rigging like a plague of unclean monkeys climbing with an agility and nimbleness that made Wilbur sick to his stomach
They were unlike any Chinamen he had ever seenhideous to a degree that he had imagined impossible in a human being
On two occasions a fight developed and in an instant the little hatchets were flashing like the flash of a snakes fangs
Toward the end of the day one of them returned to the junk screaming like a stuck pig a bit of his chin bitten off
Moran and Wilbur kept to the quarterdeck always within reach of the huge cuttingin spades but the Chinese beachcombers were too elated over their prize to pay them much attention
And indeed the dead monster proved a veritable treasuretrove
By the end of the day he had been triced up to the foremast and all hands straining at the windlass had raised the mighty head out of the water
The Chinamen descended upon the smooth black body their bare feet sliding and slipping at every step
They held on by jabbing their knives into the hide as glacierclimbers do their icepicks
The head yielded barrel after barrel of oil and a fair quantity of bone
The blubber was taken aboard the junk minced up with hatchets and run into casks
Last of all a Chinaman cut a hole through the case and actually descending into the inside of the head stripped away the spermaceti clear as crystal and packed it into buckets which were hauled up on the junks deck
The work occupied some two or three days
During this time the Bertha Millner was keeled over to nearly twenty degrees by the weight of the dead monster
However neither Wilbur nor Moran made protest
The Chinamen would do as they pleased that was said and signed
And they did not release the schooner until the whale had been emptied of oil and blubber spermaceti and bone
At length on the afternoon of the third day the captain of the junk whose name was Hoang presented himself upon the quarter deck
He was naked to the waist and his bare brown torso was gleaming with oil and sweat
His queue was coiled like a snake around his neck his hatchet thrust into his belt
Well
said Moran coming up
Wilbur caught his breath as the two stood there facing each other so sharp was the contrast
The man the Mongolian small weazened leathercolored secretivea strange complex creature steeped in all the obscure mystery of the East nervous ill at ease and the girl the AngloSaxon daughter of the Northmen huge blond bigboned frank outspoken simple of composition open as the day bareheaded her great ropes of sandy hair falling over her breast and almost to the top of her kneeboots
As he looked at the two Wilbur asked himself where else but in California could such abrupt contrasts occur
All light announced Hoang catchum all oil catchum all bone catchum all same plenty many
You help catchum now you catchum pay
Sabe
The three principals came to a settlement with unprecedented directness
Like all Chinamen Hoang was true to his promises and he had already set apart three and a half barrels of spermaceti ten barrels of oil and some twenty pounds of bone as the schooners share in the transaction
There was no discussion over the matter
He called their attention to the discharge of his obligations and hurried away to summon his men aboard and get the junk under way again
The beachcombers returned to their junk and Wilbur and Moran set about cutting the carcass of the whale adrift
They found it would be easier to cut away the hide from around the hooks and loops of the tackle than to unfasten the tackle itself
The knots are jammed hard as steel declared Moran
Hand up that cuttingin spade stand by with the other and cut loose at the same time as I do so we can ease off the strain on these lines at the same time
Ready there cut
Moran set free the hook in the loop of black skin in a couple of strokes but Wilbur was more clumsy the skin resisted
He struck at it sharply with the heavy spade the blade hit the iron hook glanced off and opened a large slit in the carcass below the head
A gush of entrails started from the slit and Moran swore under her breath
Ease away quick there
Youll have the mast out of her next steady
Hold your spadewhats that
Wilbur had nerved himself against the dreadful stench he expected would issue from the putrid monster but he was surprised to note a pungent sweet and spicy odor that all at once made thick the air about him
It was an aromatic smell stronger than that of the salt ocean stronger even than the reek of oil and blubber from the schooners waistsweet as incense penetrating as attar delicious as a summer breeze
It smells pretty good whatever it is he answered
Moran came up to where he stood and looked at the slit he had made in the whales carcass
Out of it was bulging some kind of dull white matter marbled with gray
It was a hard lump of irregular shape and about as big as a hogshead
Moran glanced over to the junk some forty feet distant
The beachcombers were hoisting the lugsail
Hoang was at the steering oar
Get that stuff aboard she commanded quietly
That
exclaimed Wilbur pointing to the lump
Morans blue eyes were beginning to gleam
Yes and do it before the Chinamen see you
Butbut I dont understand
Moran stepped to the quarterdeck unslung the hammock in which Wilbur slept and tossed it to him
Reeve it up in that Ill pass you a line and well haul it aboard
Godsend those vermin yonder have got smells enough of their own without noticing this
Hurry mate Ill talk afterward
Wilbur went over the side and standing as best he could upon the slippery carcass dug out the lump and bound it up in the hammock
Hoh
exclaimed Moran with sudden exultation
Theres a lot of it
Thats the biggest lump yet Ill be bound
Is that all there is matelook carefully
Her voice had dropped to a whisper
Yes yes thats all
Careful now when you haul upHoang has got his eye on you and so have the rest of them
What do you call it anyhow
Why are you so particular about it
Is it worth anything
I dont knowperhaps
Well have a look at it anyway
Moran hauled the stuff aboard and Wilbur followed
Whew
he exclaimed with halfclosed eyes
Its like the story of Samson and the dead lionthe sweet coming forth from the strong
The schooner seemed to swim in a bath of perfumed air the membrane of the nostrils fairly prinkled with the sensation
Moran unleashed the hammock and going down upon one knee examined the lump attentively
It didnt seem possible Wilbur heard her saying to herself but there cant be any mistake
Its the stuff right enough
Ive heard of such things but thisbut this She rose to her feet tossing back her hair
Well said Wilbur what do you call it
The thing to do now returned Moran is to get clear of here as quietly and as quickly as we can and take this stuff with us
I cant stop to explain now but its bigits big
Mate its big as the Bank of England
Those beachcombers are right on to the game Im afraid said Wilbur
Look theyre watching us
This stuff would smell across the ocean
Rot the beachcombers
Theres a bit of wind thank God and we can do four knots to their one just let us get clear once
Moran dragged the hammock back into the cabin and returning upon deck helped Wilbur to cut away the last tricing tackle
The schooner righted slowly to an even keel
Meanwhile the junk had set its one lugsail and its crew had run out the sweeps
Hoang took the steering sweep and worked the junk to a position right across the Berthas bows some fifty feet ahead
Theyre watching us right enough said Wilbur
Up your mainsl ordered Moran
The pair set the fore and main sails with great difficulty
Moran took the wheel and Wilbur went forward to cast off the line by which the schooner had been tied up to one of the whales flukes
Cut it
cried the girl
Dont stop to cast off
There was a hail from the beachcombers the port sweeps dipped and the junk bore up nearer
Hurry
shouted Moran dont mind them
Are we clear forard whats the trouble
Somethings holding her
The schooner listed slowly to starboard and settled by the head
All clear
cried Wilbur
Theres something wrong
exclaimed Moran shes settling forard
Hoang hailed the schooner a second time
Were still settling called Wilbur from the bows whats the matter
Matter that shes taking water answered Moran wrathfully
Shes started something below what with all that lifting and dancing and tricing up
Wilbur ran back to the quarterdeck
This is a bad fix he said to Moran
Those chaps are coming aboard again
Theyre on to something and of course at just this moment she begins to leak
They are after that ambergris said Moran between her teeth
Smelled it of coursethe swine
Ambergris
The stuff we found in the whale
Thats ambergris
Well
Well
shouted Moran exasperated
Do you know that we have found a lump that will weigh close to 250 pounds and do you know that ambergris is selling in San Francisco at 40 an ounce
Do you know that we have picked up nearly 150000 right out here in the ocean and are in a fair way to lose it all
Cant we run for it
Run for it in a boat thats taking water like a sack
Our dorys gone
Suppose we get clear of the junk and the Bertha sank
Then what
If we only had our crew aboard if we were only ten to their dozenif we were only sixby Jupiter
Id fight them for it
The two enormous red eyes of the junk loomed alongside and stared over into the Berthas waist
Hoang and seven of the coolies swarmed aboard
What now
shouted Moran coming forward to meet them her scowl knotting her flashing eyes together
Is this ship yours or mine
Weve done your dirty work for you
I want you clear of my deck
Wilbur stood at her side uncertain what to do but ready for anything she should attempt
I tink you catchum someting smellum pretty big said Hoang his ferret glance twinkling about the schooner
I catchum nothingnothing but plenty bad stink said Moran
No you dont
she exclaimed putting herself in Hoangs way as he made for the cabin
The other beachcombers came crowding up Wilbur even thought he saw one of them loosening his hatchet in his belt
This ships mine cried Moran backing to the cabin door
Wilbur followed her and the Chinamen closed down upon the pair
Its not much use Moran he muttered
Theyll rush us in a minute
But the ambergris is mineis mine she answered never taking her eyes from the confronting coolies
We findum wale said Hoang you no find wale him blong to weeveyting in um wale blong to we savvy
No you promised us a third of everything you found
Even in the confusion of the moment it occurred to Wilbur that it was quite possible that at least twothirds of the ambergris did belong to the beachcombers by right of discovery
After all it was the beachcombers who had found the whale
He could never remember afterward whether or no he said as much to Moran at the time
If he did she had been deaf to it
A fury of wrath and desperation suddenly blazed in her blue eyes
Standing at her side Wilbur could hear her teeth grinding upon each other
She was blind to all danger animated only by a sense of injustice and imposition
Hoang uttered a sentence in Cantonese
One of the coolies jumped forward and Morans fist met him in the face and brought him to his knees
Then came the rush Wilbur had foreseen
He had just time to catch a sight of Moran at grapples with Hoang when a little hatchet glinted over his head
He struck out savagely into the thick of the groupand then opened his eyes to find Moran washing the blood from his hair as he lay on the deck with his head in the hollow of her arm
Everything was quiet
The beach combers were gone
Hello whatwhatwhat is it
he asked springing to his feet his head swimming and smarting
We had a row didnt we
Did they hurt you
Oh I remember I got a cut over the headone of their hatchet men
Did they hurt you
They got the loot she growled
Filthy vermin
And just to make everything pleasant the schooners sinking
VIII A RUN FOR LAND SINKING
exclaimed Wilbur
Moran was already on her feet
Well have to beach her she cried and were six miles out
Up yr jib mate
The two set the jib flyingjib and staysails
The fore and main sails were already drawing and under all the spread of her canvas the Bertha raced back toward the shore
But by the time she was within the head of the bay her stern had settled to such an extent that the forefoot was clear of the water the bowsprit pointing high into the heavens
Moran was at the wheel her scowl thicker than ever her eyes measuring the stretch of water that lay between the schooner and the shore
Shell never make it in Gods world she muttered as she listened to the wash of the water in the cabin under her feet
In the hold empty barrels were afloat knocking hollowly against each other
Were in a bad way mate
If it comes to that returned Wilbur surprised to see her thus easily downcast who was usually so indomitableif it comes to that we can swim for ita couple of planks Swim
she echoed Im not thinking of that of course we could swim
What then
The sharks
Wilburs teeth clicked sharply together
He could think of nothing to say
As the water gained between decks the schooners speed dwindled and at the same time as she approached the shore the wind shut off by the land fell away
By this time the ocean was not four inches below the sternrail
Two miles away was the nearest sand spit
Wilbur broke out a distress signal on the foremast in the hope that Charlie and the deserters might send off the dory to their assistance
But the deserters were nowhere in sight
What became of the junk
he demanded suddenly of Moran
She motioned to the westward with her head
Still lying outside
Twenty minutes passed
Once only Moran spoke
When she begins to go she said shell go with a rush
Jump pretty wide or youll get caught in the suction
The two had given up all hope
Moran held grimly to the wheel as a mere matter of form
Wilbur stood at her side his clinched fists thrust into his pockets
The eyes of both were fixed on the yellow line of the distant beach
By and by Moran turned to him with an odd smile
Were a strange pair to die together she said
Wilbur met her eyes an instant but finding no reply put his chin in the air as though he would have told her she might well say that
A strange pair to die together Moran repeated but we can do that better than we could haveshe looked away from himcould have LIVED together she finished and smiled again
And yet said Wilbur these last few weeks here on board the schooner we have been through a good dealtogether
I dont know he went on clumsily I dont know when Ive beenwhen Ive hadIve been happier than these last weeks
It is queer isnt it
I know of course what youll say
Ive said it to myself often of late
I belong to the city and to my life there and youyou belong to the ocean
I never knew a girl like you never knew a girl COULD be like you
You dont know how extraordinary it all seems to me
You swear like a man and you dress like a man and I dont suppose youve ever been associated with other women and youre strongI know you are as strong as I am
You have no idea how different you are to the kind of girl Ive known
Imagine my kind of girl standing up before Hoang and those cutthroat beachcombers with their knives and hatchets
Maybe its because you are so unlike my kind of girl thatthat things are as they are with me
I dont know
Its a queer situation
A month or so ago I was at a tea in San Francisco and now Im aboard a sharkfishing schooner sinking in Magdalena Bay and Im with a girl thatthatthat Iwell Im with you and well you know how it isI might as well say itI love you more than I imagined I ever could love a girl
Morans frown came back to her forehead
I dont like that kind of talk she said I am not used to it and I dont know how to take it
Believe me she said with a half laugh its all wasted
I never could love a man
Im not made for men
No said Wilbur nor for other women either
Nor for other women either
Wilbur fell silent
In that instant he had a distinct vision of Morans life and character shunning men and shunned of women a strange lonely creature solitary as the ocean whereon she lived beautiful after her fashion as yet without sex proud untamed splendid in her savage primal independencea thing untouched and unsullied by civilization
She seemed to him some Bradamante some mythical Brunhilde some Valkyrie of the legends born out of season lost and unfamiliar in this endofthecentury time
Her purity was the purity of primeval glaciers
He could easily see how to such a girl the love of a man would appear only in the light of a humiliationa degradation
And yet she COULD love else how had HE been able to love her
Wilbur found himselfeven at that momentwondering how the thing could be donewondering to just what note the untouched cords would vibrate
Just how she should be awakened one morning to find that sheMoran searover virgin unconquered without law without land without sexwas after all a woman
By God mate
she exclaimed of a sudden
The barrels are keeping us upthe empty barrels in the hold
Hoh
well make land yet
It was true
The empty hogsheads destined for the storage of oil had been forced up by the influx of the water to the roof of the hold and were acting as so many buoysthe schooner could sink no lower
An hour later the quarterdeck all awash her bow thrown high into the air listing horribly to starboard the Bertha Millner took ground on the shore of Magdalena Bay at about the turn of the tide
Moran swung herself over the side hip deep in the water and wading ashore with a line made fast to the huge skull of a whale half buried in the sand at that point
Wilbur followed
The schooner had grounded upon the southern horn of the bay and lay easily on a spit of sand
They could not examine the nature of the leak until low water the next morning
Well here we are said Moran her thumbs in her belt
What next
We may be here for two days we MAY be here for two years
It all depends upon how bad a hole she has
Have we put in for repairs or have we been cast away
Cant tell till tomorrow morning
Meanwhile Im hungry
Half of the stores of the schooner were watersoaked but upon examination Wilbur found that enough remained intact to put them beyond all fear for the present
Theres plenty of water up the creek he said and we can snare all the quail we want and then theres the fish and abalone
Even if the stores were gone we could make out very well
The schooners cabin was full of water and Wilburs hammock was gone so the pair decided to camp on shore
In that torrid weather to sleep in the open air was a luxury
In great good spirits the two sat down to their first meal on land
Moran cooked a supper that barring the absence of coffee was delicious
The whiskey was had from aboard and they pledged each other standing up in something over two stiff fingers
Moran said Wilbur you ought to have been born a man
At all events mate she saidat all events Im not a girl
NO
exclaimed Wilbur as he filled his pipe
NO youre just Moran Moran of the Lady Letty
And Ill stay that too she said decisively
Never had an evening been more beautiful in Wilburs eyes
There was not a breath of air
The stillness was so profound that the faint murmur of the blood behind the eardrums became an oppression
The ocean tiptoed toward the land with tiny rustling steps
The west was one gigantic stained window the ocean floor a solid shimmer of opalescence
Behind them sullen purples marked the horizon hooded with mountain crests and after a long while the moon shrugged a gleaming shoulder into view
Wilbur dressed in Chinese jeans and blouse with Chinese wicker sandals on his bare feet sat with his back against the whales skull smoking quietly
For a long time there was no conversation then at last No said Moran in a low voice
This is the life Im made for
In six years Ive not spent three consecutive weeks on land
Now that Eilert she always spoke of her father by his first name now that Eilert is dead Ive not a tie not a relative not even a friend and I dont wish it
But the loneliness of the life the solitude said Wilbur thats what I dont understand
Did it ever occur to you that the best happiness is the happiness that one shares
Moran clasped a knee in both hands and looked out to sea
She never wore a hat and the red light of the afterglow was turning her ryehued hair to saffron
Hoh
she exclaimed her heavy voice pitched even lower than usual
Who could understand or share any of my pleasures or be happy when Im happy
And besides Im happiest when Im aloneI dont want any one
But hesitated Wilbur one is not always alone
After all youre a girl and men sailormen especially are beasts when its a question of a womanan unprotected woman
Im stronger than most men said Moran simply
If you for instance had been like some men I should have fought you
It wouldnt have been the first time she added smoothing one huge braid between her palms
Wilbur looked at her with intent curiositynoted again as if for the first time the rough blue overalls thrust into the shoes the coarse flannel shirt open at the throat the belt with its sheathknife her arms big and white and tattooed in sailor fashion her thick muscular neck her red face with its pale blue eyes and almost massive jaw and her hair her heavy yellow fragrant hair that lay over her shoulder and breast coiling and looping in her lap
No he said with a long breath I dont make it out
I knew you were out of my experience but I begin to think now that you are out of even my imagination
You are right you SHOULD keep to yourself
You should be aloneyour mate isnt made yet
You are splendid just as you are while under his breath he added his teeth clinching and God
but I love you
It was growing late the stars were all out the moon riding high
Moran yawned Mate I think Ill turn in
Well have to be at that schooner early in the morning and I make no doubt shell give us plenty to do
Wilbur hesitated to reply waiting to take his cue from what next she should say
Its hot enough to sleep where we are she added without going aboard the Bertha though we might have a couple of blankets off to lie on
This sands as hard as a plank
Without answering Wilbur showed her a couple of blanketrolls he had brought off while he was unloading part of the stores that afternoon
They took one apiece and spread them on the sand by the bleached whales skull
Moran pulled off her boots and stretched herself upon her blanket with absolute unconcern her hands clasped under her head
Wilbur rolled up his coat for a pillow and settled himself for the night with an assumed self possession
There was a long silence
Moran yawned again
I pulled the heel off my boot this morning she said lazily and Ive been limping all day
I noticed it answered Wilbur
Kitchell had a new pair aboard somewhere if theyre not spoiled by the water now
Yes
she said indifferently well look them up in the morning
Again there was silence
I wonder she began again staring up into the dark if Charlie took that fryingpan off with him when he went
I dont know
He probably did
It was the only thing we had to cook abalones in
Make me think to look into the galley tomorrowThis grounds as hard as nails for all your blanketsWell goodnight mate Im going to sleep
Goodnight Moran
Three hours later Wilbur who had not closed his eyes sat up and looked at Moran sleeping quietly her head in a pale glory of hair looked at her and then around him at the silent deserted land
I dont know he said to himself
Am I a rightminded man and a thoroughbred or a mushhead or merely a prudent sensible sort of chap that values his skin and bones
Id be glad to put a name to myself
Then more earnestly he added Do I love her too much or not enough or love her the wrong way or how
He leaned toward her so close that he could catch the savor of her breath and the smell of her neck warm with sleep
The sleeve of the coarse blue shirt was drawn up and it seemed to him as if her bare arm flung out at full length had some sweet aroma of its own
Wilbur drew softly back
No he said to himself decisively no I guess I am a thoroughbred after all
It was only then that he went to sleep
When he awoke the sea was pink with the sunrise and one of the bay heads was all distorted and stratified by a mirage
It was hot already
Moran was sitting a few paces from him braiding her hair
Hello Moran
he said rousing up how long have you been up
Since before sunrise she said Ive had a bath in the cove where the creek runs down
I saw a jackrabbit
Seen anything of Charlie and the others
Theyve camped on the other side of the bay
But look yonder she added
The junk had come in overnight and was about a mile and a half from shore
The deuce
exclaimed Wilbur
What are they after
Fresh water I guess said Moran knotting the end of a braid
Wed better have breakfast in a hurry and turn to on the Bertha
The tide is going out fast
While they breakfasted they kept an eye on the schooner watching her sides and flanks as the water fell slowly away
Dont see anything very bad yet said Wilbur
Its somewhere in her stern remarked Moran
In an hours time the Bertha Millner was high and dry and they could examine her at their leisure
It was Moran who found the leak
Pshaw
she exclaimed with a halflaugh we can stick that up in half an hour
A single plank had started away from the sternpost that was all
Otherwise the schooner was as sound as the day she left San Francisco
Moran and Wilbur had the damage repaired by noon nailing the plank into its place and caulking the seams with lamp wick
Nor could their most careful search discover any further injury
Were ready to go said Moran so soon as shell float
We can dig away around the bows here make fast a line to that rock out yonder and warp her off at next high tide
Hello
whos this
It was Charlie
While the two had been at work he had come around the shore unobserved and now stood at some little distance smiling at them calmly
Well what do you want
cried Moran angrily
If you had your rights my friend youd be keelhauled
I tink um velly hot day
You didnt come here to say that
What do you want
I come hab talkeetalk
We dont want to have any talkeetalk with such vermin as you
Get out
Charlie sat down on the beach and wiped his forehead
I come buy onepiecee bacon
China boy no hab got
We arent selling bacon to deserters cried Moran and Ill tell you this you filthy little monkey Mr Wilbur and I are going homeback to Friscothis afternoon and were going to leave you and the rest of your vipers to rot on this beach or to be murdered by beachcombers and she pointed out toward the junk
Charlie did not even follow the direction of her gesture and from this very indifference Wilbur guessed that it was precisely because of the beachcombers that the Machiavellian Chinaman had wished to treat with his old officers
No hab got bacon
he queried lifting his eyebrows in surprise
Plenty but not for you
Charlie took a buckskin bag from his blouse and counted out a handful of silver and gold
I buy um nisi twopiecee tobacco
Look here said Wilbur deliberately dont you try to flimflam us Charlie
We know you too well
You dont want bacon and you dont want tobacco
China boy heap plenty much sick
Two boy velly sick
I tink um die pretty soon tomolla
You catch um slopchest you gib me five seven liver pill
Sabe
Ill tell you what you want cried Moran aiming a forefinger at him pistol fashion youve got a blue funk because those Kai gingh beachcombers have come into the bay and youre more frightened of them than you are of the schooner and now you want us to take you home
How muchee
A thousand dollars
Wilbur looked at her in surprise
He had expected a refusal
You no hab got liver pill
inquired Charlie blandly
Moran turned her back on him
She and Wilbur conferred in a low voice
Wed better take them back if we decently can said Moran
The schooner is known of course in Frisco
She went out with Kitchell and a crew of coolies and she comes back with you and I aboard and if we tell the truth about it it will sound like a lie and well have no end of trouble
Then again can just you and I work the Bertha into port
In these kind of airs its plain work but suppose we have dirty weather
Im not so sure
I gib you ten dollah fo ten liver pill said Charlie
Will you give us a thousand dollars to set you down in San Francisco
Charlie rose
I go back
I tell um China boy what you say bout liver pill
Bimeby I come back
That means hell take our offer back to his friends said Wilbur in a low voice
You best hurry chopchop he called after Charlie we go home pretty soon
He knows very well we cant get away before high tide tomorrow said Moran
Hell take his time
Later on in the afternoon Moran and Wilbur saw a small boat put off from the junk and make a landing by the creek
The beach combers were taking on water
The boat made three trips before evening but the beachcombers made no show of molesting the undefended schooner or in any way interfering with Charlies camp on the other side of the bay
No
exclaimed Moran between her teeth as she and Wilbur were cooking supper no they dont need to theyve got about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars of loot on boardOUR loot too
Good God
it goes against the grain
The moon rose considerably earlier that night and by twelve oclock the bay was flooded with its electrical whiteness
Wilbur and Moran could plainly make out the junk tied up to the kelp off shore
But toward one oclock Wilbur was awakened by Moran shaking his arm
Theres something wrong out there she whispered something wrong with the junk
Hear em squealing
Look
look
look
she cried of a sudden its their turn now
Wilbur could see the crank junk with its staring red eyes high stern and prow as distinctly as though at noonday
As he watched it seemed as if a great wave caught her suddenly underfoot
She heaved up bodily out of the water dropped again with a splash rose again and again fell back into her own ripples that widening from her sides broke crisply on the sand at Wilburs feet
Then the commotion ceased abruptly
The bay was quiet again
An hour passed then two
The moon began to set
Moran and Wilbur wearied of watching had turned in again when they were startled to wakefulness by the creak of oarlocks and the sound of a boat grounding in the sand
The cooliesthe deserters from the Bertha Millnerwere there
Charlie came forward
Ge lup
Ge lup
he said
Junk all smash
Kaigingh come ashore
I tink him want catch um schooner
IX THE CAPTURE OF HOANG What smashed the junk
What wrecked her
demanded Moran
The deserting Chinamen huddled around Charlie drawing close as if finding comfort in the feel of each others elbows
No can tell answered Charlie
Him shake then lif up all the same as we
Bimeby too much lif up him smash all toFour piecee Chinamen dlown
Drown
Did any of them drown
exclaimed Moran
Fourpiecee dlown reiterated Charlie calmly
One thlee five nine come asho
Him other no come
Where are the ones that came ashore
asked Wilbur
Charlie waved a hand back into the night
Him make um camp topside ole house
That old whalingcamp prompted Moran
Then to Wilbur You rememberabout a hundred yards north the creek
Wilbur Moran and Charlie had drawn off a little from the Bertha Millners crew
The latter squatted in a line along the shore silent reserved looking vaguely seaward through the night
Moran spoke again her scowl thickening What makes you think the beachcombers want our schooner
Him catch um schooner sure
Him want um boat to go home
No can get
Lets put off tonightright away said Wilbur
Low tide answered Moran and besidesCharlie did you see them close
Were you near them
No go muchee close
Did they have something with them reeved up in a hammock something that smelled sweet
Like a jossstick for instance
No savvy no can tell
Him try catch um schooner sure
Him velly bad China boy
See Yup China boy velly bad
I blong Sam Yup
Savvy
Ah
the Tongs
Yas
I Sam Yup
Him and he pointed to the Berthas crew Sam Yup
All we Sam Yup nisi him and he waved a hand toward the beachcombers camp him See Yup
Savvy
Its a Tong row said Wilbur
Theyre blood enemies the See Yups and Sam Yups
Moran fell thoughtful digging her bootheel into the sand her thumbs hooked into her belt her forehead gathered into a heavy frown
There was a silence
One thing she said at last we cant give up the schooner
They would take our stores as well and then where are we
Marooned by Jove
How far do you suppose we are from the nearest town
Three hundred miles wouldnt be a bad guess and theyve got the lootour ambergrisIll swear to that
They didnt leave that aboard when the junk sank
Look here Charlie she said turning to the Chinaman
If the beachcombers take the schoonerthe Bertha Millnerfrom us well be left to starve on this beach
I tink um yass
How are we going to get home
Are you going to let them do it
Are you going to let them have our schooner
I tink no can have
Look here she went on with sudden energy
There are only nine of them now to our eight
Were about even
We can fight those swine
I know we can
If we jumped their camp and rushed them hard believe me we could run them into the sea
Mate she cried suddenly facing Wilbur are you game
Have you got blood in you
Those beachcomberes are going to attack us tomorrow before high tidethats flat
Theres going to be a fight anyway
We cant let them have the schooner
Its starvation for us if we do
They mean to make a dash for the Bertha and weve got to fight them off
If theres any attacking to be done I propose to do it
I propose we jump their camp before it gets lightnowtonight right awayrun in on them there take them by surprise do for one or two of them if we have to and get that ambergris
Then cut back to the schooner up our sails and wait for the tide to float us off
We can do itI know we can
Mate will you back me up
Back you up
You bet Ill back you up Moran
But Wilbur hesitated
We could fight them so much more to advantage from the deck of the schooner
Why not wait for them aboard
We could have our sails up anyhow and we could keep the beachcombers off till the tide rose high enough to drive them back
Why not do that
I tink bes wait topside boat assented Charlie
Yes why not Moran
Because shouted the girl theyve got our loot
I dont propose to be plundered of 150000 if I can help it
Wassa dat
demanded Charlie
Hunder fiftee tlousand you hab got
I did have itwe had it the mate and I
We triced a sperm whale for the beachcombers and when they thought they had everything out of him we found a lump of ambergris in him that will weigh close to two hundred pounds
Now look here Charlie
The beachcombers have got the stuff
Its mineIm going to have it back
Heres the lay
Your men can fightyou can fight yourself
Well make it a business proposition
Help me to get that ambergris and if we get it Ill give each one of the men 1000 and Ill give you 1500
You can take that up and be independent rich the rest of your life
You can chuck it and rot on this beach for its fight or lose the schooner you know that as well as I do
If youve got to fight anyhow why not fight where its going to pay the most
Charlie hesitated pursing his lips
How about this Moran
Wilbur broke forth now unheard by Charlie
Ive just been thinking have we got a right to this ambergris after all
The beachcombers found the whale
It was theirs
How have we the right to take the ambergris away from them any more than the sperm and the oil and the bone
Its theirs if you come to that
I dont know as weve the right to it
Darn you
shouted Moran in a blaze of fury right to it right to it
If I havent who has
Who found it
Those dirty monkeys might have stood some show to a claim if theyd held to the one third bargain and offered to divvy with us when they got me where I couldnt help myself
I dont say Id give in now if they had give in to let em walk off with a hundred thousand dollars that Ive got as good a claim to as they have
But theyve saved me the trouble of arguing the question
Theyve taken it all all
And theres no bargain in the game at all now
Now the stuff belongs to the strongest of us and Im glad of it
They thought they were the strongest and now theyre going to find out
Were dumped down here on this Godforsaken sand and theres no law and no policemen
The strongest of us are going to live and the weakest are going to die
Im going to live and Im going to have my loot too and Im not going to split fine hairs with these robbers at this time of day
Im going to have it all and thats the law youre under in this case my righteous friend
She turned her back upon him spinning around upon her heel
and Wilbur felt ashamed of himself and proud of her
I go talkeetalk to China boy said Charlie coming up
For about five minutes the Chinamen conferred together squatting in a circle on the beach
Moran paced up and down by the stranded dory
Wilbur leaned against the bleached whaleskull his hands in his pockets
Once he looked at his watch
It was nearly one oclock
All light said Charlie coming up from the group at last him fight plenty
Now exclaimed Moran weve no time to waste
What arms have we got
Weve got the cuttingin spades said Wilbur theres five of them
Theyre nearly ten feet long and the blades are as sharp as razors you couldnt want better pikes
Thats an idea returned Moran evidently willing to forget her outburst of a moment before perhaps already sorry for it
The party took stock of their weapons and five huge cuttingin spades a heavy knife from the galley and a revolver of doubtful effectiveness were divided among them
The crew took the spades Charlie the knife and Wilbur the revolver
Moran had her own knife a haftless dirk such as is affected by all Norwegians whether landsmen or sailors
They were examining this armament and Moran was suggesting a plan of attack when Hoang the leader of the beachcombers and one other Chinaman appeared some little distance below them on the beach
The moon was low and there was no great light but the two beachcombers caught the flash of the points of the spades
They halted and glanced narrowly and suspiciously at the group
Beasts
muttered Moran
They are up to the gametheres no surprising them now
Talk to him Charlie see what he wants
Moran Wilbur and Charlie came part of the way toward Hoang and his fellow and paused some fifteen feet distant and a long colloquy ensued
It soon became evident however that in reality Hoang wanted nothing of them though with great earnestness he asserted his willingness to charter the Bertha Millner back to San Francisco
Thats not his game at all said Moran to Wilbur in a low tone her eyes never leaving those of the beachcomber
Hes pretty sure he could seize the Bertha and never pay us a stiver
Theyve come down to spy on us and theyre doing it too
Theres no good trying to rush that camp now
Theyll go back and tell the crew that we know their lay
It was still very dark
Near the hulk of the beached Bertha Millner were grouped her crew each armed with a long and lance like cuttingin spade watching and listening to the conference of the chiefs
The moon almost down had flushed bloodred violently streaking the gray smooth surface of the bay with her reflection
The tide was far out rippling quietly along the reaches of wet sand
In the pauses of the conference the vast muffling silence shut down with the abruptness of a valve suddenly closed
How it happened just who made the first move in precisely what manner the action had been planned or what led up to it Wilbur could not afterward satisfactorily explain
There was a rush forwardhe remembered that mucha dull thudding of feet over the resounding beach surface a moments writhing struggle with a halfnaked brown figure that used knife and nail and tooth and then the muffling silence again broken only by the sound of their own panting
In that whirl of swift action Wilbur could reconstruct but two brief pictures the Chinaman Hoangs companion flying like one possessed along the shore Hoang himself flung headlong into the arms of the Berthas coolies and Moran her eyes blazing her thick braids flying brandishing her fist as she shouted at the top of her deep voice Weve got you anyhow
They had taken Hoang prisoner whether by treachery or not Wilbur did not exactly know and even if unfair means had been used he could not repress a feeling of delight and satisfaction as he told himself that in the very beginning of the fight that was to follow he and his mates had gained the first advantage
As the action of that nights events became more and more accelerated Wilbur could not but notice the change in Moran
It was very evident that the old Norse fighting blood of her was all astir brutal merciless savage beyond all control
A sort of obsession seized upon her at the near approach of battle a frenzy of action that was checked by nothingthat was insensible to all restraint
At times it was impossible for him to make her hear him or when she heard to understand what he was saying
Her vision contracted
It was evident that she could not see distinctly
Wilbur could no longer conceive of her as a woman of the days of civilization
She was lapsing back to the eighth century againto the Vikings the seawolves the Berserkers
Now youre going to talk she cried to Hoang as the bound Chinaman sat upon the beach leaning his back against the great skull
Charlie ask him if they saved the ambergris when the junk went downif theyve got it now
Charlie put the question in Chinese but the beachcomber only twinkled his vicious eyes upon them and held his peace
With the full sweep of her arm her fist clinched till the knuckles whitened Moran struck him in the face
Now will you talk
she cried
Hoang wiped the blood from his face upon his shoulder and set his jaws
He did not answer
You will talk before Im done with you my friend dont get any wrong notions in your head about that Moran continued her teeth clinched
Charlie she added is there a file aboard the schooner
I tink um yass boss hab got file
In the toolchest isnt it
Charlie nodded and Moran ordered it to be fetched
If were to fight that crowd she said speaking to herself and in a rapid voice thick from excitement and passion weve got to know where theyve hid the loot and what weapons theyve got
If they have a rifle or a shotgun with them its going to make a big difference for us
The other fellow escaped and has gone back to warn the rest
Its fight now and no mistake
The Chinaman who had been sent aboard the schooner returned carrying a long rather coarsegrained file
Moran took it from him
Now she said standing in front of Hoang Ill give you one more chance
Answer me
Did you bring off the ambergris you beast when your junk sank
Where is it now
How many men have you
What arms have you got
Have your men got a rifleCharlie put that all to him in your lingo so as to make sure that he understands
Tell him if he dont talk Im going to make him very sick
Charlie put the questions in Chinese pausing after each one
Hoang held his peace
I gave you fair warning shouted Moran angrily pointing at him with the file
Will you answer
Him no tell nuttin observed Charlie
Fetch a cord here commanded Moran
The cord was brought and despite Hoangs struggles and writhings the file was thrust end ways into his mouth and his jaws bound tightly together upon it by means of the cord passed over his head and under his chin
Some four inches of the file portruded from his lips
Moran took this end and drew it out between the beachcombers teeth then pushed it back slowly
The hideous rasp of the operation turned Wilburs blood cold within him
He looked awayout to sea down the beachanywhere so that he might not see what was going forward
But the persistent grind and scrape still assaulted his ears
He turned about sharply
IIIll go down the beach here a ways he said quickly
I cant standIll keep watch to see if the beachcombers come up
A few minutes later he heard Charlie hailing him
Chinchin heap plenty now said he with a grin as Wilbur came up
Hoang sat on the sand in the midst of the circle
The file and coil of rope lay on the ground near by
The beachcomber was talking in a highkeyed singsong but with a lisp
He told them partly in pigeon English and partly in Cantonese which Charlie translated that their men were eight in number and that they had intended to seize the schooner that night but that probably his own capture had delayed their plans
They had no rifle
A shotgun had been on board but had gone down with the sinking of the junk
The ambergris had been cut into two lumps and would be found in a couple of old floursacks in the stern of the boat in which he and his men had come ashore
They were all armed with their little hatchets
He thought two of the men carried knives as well
There was neither pistol nor revolver among them
It seems to me said Wilbur that weve got the long end
We catch um boss too
said Charlie pointing to Hoang
And we are better armed assented Moran
Weve got the cuttingin spades
And the revolver if it will shoot any further than it will kick
Theyll give us all the fight we want declared Moran
Oh him Kaigingh him fight all same devil
Give the men brandy Charlie commanded Moran
Well rush that camp right away
The demijohn of spirits was brought down from the Bertha and passed around Wilbur and Moran drinking from the tin cup the coolies from the bottle
Hoang was fettered and locked in the Berthas cabin
Now then are we ready
cried Moran
I tink all light answered Charlie
The party set off down the beach
The moon had long since gone down and the dawn was whitening over the eastern horizon
Landward ragged blankets of morning mist lay close in the hollows here and there
It was profoundly still
The stars were still out
The surface of Magdalena Bay was smooth as a sheet of gray silk
Twenty minutes passed half an hour an hour
The party tramped steadily forward Moran Wilbur and Charlie leading the coolies close behind carrying the cuttingin spades over their shoulders
Slowly and in silence they made the half circuit of the bay
The Bertha Millner was far behind them by now a vague gray mass in the early morning light
Did you ever fight before
Moran suddenly demanded of Charlie
One time I fight plenty much in San Flancisco in Washington stleet
Fight um See Yups
Another halfhour passed
At times when they halted they began to hear the faint murmur of the creek just beyond which was the broken and crumbling shanty relic of an old Portuguese whaling camp where the beachcombers were camped
At Charlies suggestion the party made a circuit describing a half moon to landward so as to come out upon the enemy sheltered by the sand dunes
Twenty minutes later they crossed the creek about four hundred yards from the shore
Here they spread out into a long line and keeping an interval of about fifteen feet between each of them moved cautiously forward
The unevenness of the sand breaks hid the shore from view but Moran Wilbur and Charlie knew that by keeping the creek upon their left they would come out directly upon the house
A few moments later Charlie held up his hand and the men halted
The noise of the creek chattering into the tidewater of the bay was plainly audible just beyond a ridge of sand covered thinly with sagebrush and a faint column of smoke rose into the air over the ridge itself
They were close in
The coolies were halted and dropping upon their hands and knees the three leaders crawled to the top of the break
Sheltered by a couple of sage bushes and lying flat to the ground Wilbur looked over and down upon the beach
The first object he made out was a crazy roofless house built of driftwood the chinks plastered with dobe mud the door fallen in
Beyond on the beach was a flatbottomed dingy unpainted and foul with dirt
But all around the house the sand had been scooped and piled to form a low barricade and behind this barricade Wilbur saw the beachcombers
There were eight of them
They were alert and ready their hatchets in their hands
The gaze of each of them was fixed directly upon the sandbreak which sheltered the Bertha Millners officers and crew
They seemed to Wilbur to look him straight in the eye
They neither moved nor spoke
The silence and absolute lack of motion on the part of these small halfnaked Chinamen with their apelike muzzles and twinkling eyes was ominous
There could be no longer any doubts that the beachcombers had known of their enemies movements and were perfectly aware of their presence behind the sandbreak
Moran rose to her feet and Wilbur and Charlie followed her example
Theres no use hiding she said they know were here
Charlie called up the crew
The two parties were ranged face to face
Over the eastern rim of the Pacific the blue whiteness of the early dawn was turning to a dull roseate gold at the core of the sunrise
The headlands of Magdalena Bay stood black against the pale glow overhead the greater stars still shone
The monotonous faint ripple of the creek was the only sound
It was about 330 oclock
A BATTLE Wilbur had imagined that the fight would be hardly more than a wild rush down the slope of the beach a dash over the beach combers breastworks of sand and a brief handtohand scrimmage around the old cabin
In all accounts he had ever read of such affairs and in all ideas he had entertained on the subject this had always been the case
The two bodies had shocked together like a college rush there had been five minutes play of knife and club and gun a confused whirl of dust and smoke and all was over before one had time either to think or be afraid
But nothing of the kind happened that morning
The Bertha Millners crew in a long line Moran at one end Wilbur at the other and Charlie in the centre came on toward the beachcombers step by step
There was little outcry
Each contestant singled out his enemy and made slowly for him with eyes fixed and weapon ready regardless of the movements of his mates
See any rifles among them Charlie
shouted Moran suddenly breaking the silence
No I tink no hab got answered Charlie
Wilbur took another step forward and cocked his revolver
One of the beachcombers shouted out something in angry vernacular and Charlie instantly responded
All this time the line had been slowly advancing upon the enemy and Wilbur began to wonder how long that heartbreaking suspense was to continue
This was not at all what he had imagined
Already he was within twenty feet of his man could see the evil glint of his slant small eye and the shine of his yellow body naked to the belt
Still foot by foot the forward movement continued
The Chinese on either side had begun exchanging insults the still hot air of the tropic dawn was vibrant with the Cantonese monosyllables tossed back and forth like tennisballs over the low sand rampart
The thing was degenerating into a farcethe Berthas Chinamen would not fight
Back there under the shelter of the schooner it was all very well to talk and they had been very brave when they had all flung themselves upon Hoang
Here face to face with the enemy the sun striking off heliograph flashes from their knives and spades it was a vastly different matter
The thing to Wilburs mind should have been done suddenly if it was to be done at all
The best course now was to return to camp and try some other plan
Charlie shouted a direction to him in pigeon English that he did not understand but he answered all right and moved forward another step so as to be in line with the coolie at his left
The liquor that he had drunk before starting began suddenly to affect him yet he knew that his head was yet clear
He could not bring himself to run away before them all but he would have given much to have discovered a good reason for postponing the fightif fight there was to be
He remembered the cocked revolver in his hand and suddenly raising it fired pointblank at his man not fifteen feet away
The hammer snapped on the nipple but the cartridge did not explode
Wilbur turned to the Chinaman next him in line exclaiming excitedly Here say have you got a knifesomething I can fight with
This guns no good
There was a shout from Moran Look out here they come
Two of the beachcombers suddenly sprang over the sand breastworks and ran toward Charlie their knives held low in front of them ready to rip
Shoot
shoot
shoot
shouted Moran rapidly
Wilburs revolver was a selfcocker
He raised it again drawing hard on the trigger as he did so
It roared and leaped in his hand and a whiff of burned powder came to his nostrils
Then Wilbur was astonished to hear himself shout at the top of his voice Come on now get into themget into them now everybody
The Berthas Chinamen were all running forward three of them well in advance of the others
In the rear Charlie was at grapples with a beachcomber who fought with a knife in each hand and Wilbur had a sudden glimpse of another sitting on the sand with his hand to his mouth the blood spurting between his fingers
Wilbur suddenly realized that he held a knife and that he was directly abreast the sand rampart
How he got the knife he could not tell though he afterward distinctly remembered throwing away his revolver loaded as it was
He had leaped the breastworks he knew that and between him and the vast bright blur of the ocean he saw one of the beachcombers backing away and watching him intently his hatchet in his hand
Wilbur had only time to think that he himself would no doubt be killed within the next few moments when this latter halted abruptly took a step forward and
instead of striking downward as Wilbur had anticipated dropped upon his knee and struck with all his might at the calf of Wilburs leg
It was only the thickness of his boots that saved Wilbur from being hamstrung where he stood
As it was he felt the blade bite almost to the bone and heard the blood squelch in the sole of his boot as he staggered for the moment almost tripping over the man in front of him
The Chinaman sprang to his feet again but Wilbur was at him in an instant feeling instinctively that his chance was to close with his man and so bring his own superior weight and strength to bear
Again and again he tried to run in and grip the slim yellow body but the other dodged and backed away as hard to hold as any fish
All around and back of him now Wilbur heard the hideous sound of stamping and struggling and the noise of hoarse quick shouts and the rebound of bodies falling and rolling upon the hard smooth beach
The thing had not been a farce after all
This was fighting at last and there within arms length were men grappling and gripping and hitting one another each honestly striving to kill his fellowChinamen all fighting in barbarous Oriental fashion with nails and teeth when the knife or hatchet failed
What did he clubman and college man in that hideous trouble that wrought itself out there on that heatstricken tropic beach under that mornings sun
Suddenly there was a flash of red flame and a billow of thick yellow smoke filled all the air
The cabin was afire
The hatchetman with whom Wilbur was fighting had been backing in this direction
He was close in when the fire began to leap from the one window now he could go no further
He turned to run sidewise between his enemy and the burning cabin
Wilbur thrust his foot sharply forward the beachcomber tripped staggered and before he had reached the ground Wilbur had driven home the knife
Then suddenly at the sight of his smitten enemy rolling on the ground at his feet the primitive man the halfbrute of the stone age leaped to life in Wilburs breasthe felt his muscles thrilling with a strength they had not known before
His nerves stretched tense as harpstrings were vibrating to a new tune
His blood spun through his veins till his ears roared with the rush of it
Never had he conceived of such savage exultation as that which mastered him at that instant
The knowledge that he could kill filled him with a sense of power that was veritably royal
He felt physically larger
It was the joy of battle the horrid exhilaration of killing the animal of the race the human brute suddenly aroused and dominating every instinct and tradition of centuries of civilization
The fight still was going forward
Wilbur could hear the sounds of it though from where he stood all sight was shut off by the smoke of the burning house
As he turned about knife in hand debating what next he should do a figure burst down upon him shadowy and distorted through the haze
It was Moran but Moran as Wilbur had never seen her before
Her eyes were blazing under her thick frown like fire under a bush
Her arms were bared to the elbow her heavy ropes of hair flying and coiling from her in all directions while with a voice hoarse from shouting she sang or rather chanted in her longforgotten Norse tongue fragments of old sagas words and sentences meaningless even to herself
The fury of battle had exalted her to a sort of frenzy
She was beside herself with excitement
Once more she had lapsed back to the Vikings and searovers of the tenth centuryshe was Brunhilde again a shieldmaiden a Valkyrie a Berserker and the daughter of Berserkers and like them she fought in a veritable frenzy seeing nothing hearing nothing every sense exalted every force doubled insensible to pain deaf to all reason
Her dirk uplifted she rushed upon Wilbur never once pausing in her chant
Wilbur shouted a warning to her as she came on puzzled beyond words startled back to a consciousness of himself again by this insensate attack
Moran
Moran
he called
What is ityoure wrong
Its I
Its Wilburyour mate cant you see
Moran could not seeblind to friend or foe as she was deaf to reason she struck at him with all the strength of her arm
But there was no skill in her fighting now
Wilbur dropped his own knife and gripped her right wrist
She closed with him upon the instant clutching at his throat with her one free hand and as he felt her strengthdoubled and tripled in the fury of her madness Wilbur knew that however easily he had overcome his enemy of a moment before he was now fighting for his very life
At first Wilbur merely struggled to keep her from himto prevent her using her dirk
He tried not to hurt her
But what with the spirits he had drunk before the attack what with the excitement of the attack itself and the sudden unleashing of the brute in him an instant before the whole affair grew dim and hazy in his mind
He ceased to see things in their proportion
His newfound strength gloried in matching itself with another strength that was its equal
He fought with Morannot as he would fight with either woman or man or with anything human for the matter of that
He fought with her as against some impersonal force that it was incumbent upon him to conquerthat it was imperative he should conquer if he wished to live
When she struck he struck blow for blow force for force his strength against hers glorying in that strange contest though he never once forgot that this last enemy was the girl he loved
It was not Moran whom he fought it was her force her determination her will her splendid independence that he set himself to conquer
Already she had dropped or flung away the dirk and their battle had become an issue of sheer physical strength between them
It was a question now as to who should master the other
Twice she had fought Wilbur to his knees the heel of her hand upon his face his head thrust back between his shoulders and twice he had wrenched away rising to his feet again panting bleeding even but with his teeth set and all his resolution at the sticking point
Once he saw his chance and planted his knuckles squarely between her eyes where her frown was knotted hard hoping to stun her and end the fight once and for all
But the blow did not seem to affect her in the least
By this time he saw that her Berserker rage had worked itself clear as fermenting wine clears itself and that she knew now with whom she was fighting and he seemed now to understand the incomprehensible and to sympathize with her joy in measuring her strength against his and yet he knew that the combat was deadly serious and that more than life was at stake
Moran despised a weakling
For an instant as they fell apart she stood off breathing hard and rolling up her sleeve then as she started forward again Wilbur met her halfway caught her round the neck and under the arm gripping her left wrist with his right hand behind her then exerting every ounce of strength he yet retained he thrust her down and from him until at length using his hip as a pivot he swung her off her feet threw her fairly on her back and held her so one knee upon her chest his hands closed viselike on her wrists
Then suddenly Moran gave up relaxing in his grasp all in a second and to his great surprise suddenly smiled
Ho
mate she exclaimed that was a tough one but Im beaten youre stronger than I thought for
Wilbur released her and rose to his feet
Here she continued give me your hand
Im as weak as a kitten
As Wilbur helped her to her feet she put her hand to her forehead where his knuckles had left their mark and frowned at him but not illnaturedly
Next time you do that she said use a rock or a belayingpin or something that wont hurtnot your fist mate
She looked at him admiringly
What a twofisted brawny drayhorse it is
I told you I was stronger than most men didnt I
But Im the weaker of us two and thats a fact
Youve beaten mateI admit it youve conquered me and she continued smiling again and shaking him by the shoulderand mate do you know I love you for it
XI A CHANGE IN LEADERS Well exclaimed Wilbur at length the excitement of the fight returning upon him
We have plenty to do yet
Come on Moran
It was no longer Moran who took the initiativewho was the leader
The brief fight upon the shore had changed all that
It was Wilbur who was now the master it was Wilbur who was aggressive
He had known what it meant to kill
He was no longer afraid of anything no longer hesitating
He had felt a sudden quadrupling of all his strength moral and physical
All that was strong and virile and brutal in him seemed to harden and stiffen in the moment after he had seen the beachcomber collapse limply on the sand under the last strong knifeblow and a sense of triumph of boundless selfconfidence leaped within him so that he shouted aloud in a very excess of exhilaration and snatching up a heavy cuttingin spade that had been dropped in the fight near the burning cabin tossed it high into the air catching it again as it descended like any exultant savage
Come on
he cried to Moran where are the beachcombers gone
Im going to get one more before the show is over
The two passed out of the zone of smoke and reached the other side of the burning cabin just in time to see the last of the struggle
The whole affair had not taken more than a quarter of an hour
In the end the beachcombers had been beaten
Four had fled into the waste of sand and sage that lay back of the shore and had not been pursued
A fifth had been almost hamstrung by one of the Berthas coolies and had given himself up
A sixth squealing and shrieking like a tigercat had been made prisoner and Wilbur himself had accounted for the seventh
As Wilbur and Moran came around the cabin they saw the Bertha Millners Chinamen in a group not far from the waters edge reassembled after the fightpanting and bloody some of them bare to the belt their weapons still in their hands
Here and there was a bandaged arm or head but their number was completeor no was it complete
Ought to be one more said Wilbur anxiously hastening forward
As the two came up the coolies parted and Wilbur saw one of them his head propped upon a rolledup blouse lying ominously still on the trampled sand
Its Charlie
exclaimed Moran
Wheres he hurt
cried Wilbur to the group of coolies
Jim wheres Jim
Wheres he hurt Jim
Jim the only member of the crew besides Charlie who could understand or speak English answered Kaigingh him fin pistol you pistol Charlie him fight plenty bimeby when he no see onepiecee Kaigingh he come up behin shoot um Charlie in sidesavvy
Did he kill him
Is he dead
No I tinkum die plenty soon him no savvy nuttin now him all same sleep
Plenty soon bimeby him sleep for good I tink
There was little blood to be seen when Wilbur gently unwrapped the torn sleeve of a blouse that had been used as a bandage
Just under the armpit was the mark of the bulleta small puncture already closed half hidden under a clot or two of blood
The coolie lay quite unconscious his eyes wide open drawing a faint quick breath at irregular intervals
What do you think mate
asked Moran in a low voice
I think hes got it through the lungs answered Wilbur frowning in distress and perplexity
Poor old Charlie
Moran went down on a knee and put a finger on the slim corded wrist yellow as old ivory
Charlie she calledCharlie here dont you know me
Wake up old chap
Its Moran
Youre not hurt so very bad are you
Charlies eyes closed and opened a couple of times
No can tell he answered feebly hurt plenty big then he began to cough
Wilbur drew a sigh of relief
Hes all right
he exclaimed
Yes I think hes all right assented Moran
First thing to do now is to get him aboard the schooner said Wilbur
Well take him right across in the beachcombers dory here
By Jove
he exclaimed on a sudden
The ambergrisId forgotten all about it
His heart sank
In the hideous confusion of that mornings work all thought of the loot had been forgotten
Had the battle been for nothing after all
The moment the beachcombers had been made aware of the meditated attack it would have been an easy matter for them to have hidden the ambergrisdestroyed it even
In two strides Wilbur had reached the beachcombers dory and was groping in the forward cuddy
Then he uttered a great shout of satisfaction
The stuff was there all of it though the mass had been cut into quarters three parts of it stowed in tea flails the fourth still reeved up in the hammock netting
Weve got it
he cried to Moran who had followed him
Weve got it Moran
Over 100000
Were richrich as boodlers you and I Oh it was worth fighting for after all wasnt it
Now well get out of herenow well cut for home
Its only Charlie Im thinking about answered Moran hesitating
If it wasnt for that wed be all right
I dont know whether we did right after all in jumping the camp here
I wouldnt like to feel that Id got Charlie into our quarrel only to have him killed
Wilbur stared at this new Moran in no little amazement
Where was the reckless untamed girl of the previous night who had sworn at him and denounced his niggling misgivings as to right and wrong
Hoh
he retorted impatiently Charlies right enough
And besides I didnt force him to anything
Iwe that istook the same chances
If I hadnt done for my man there behind the cabin he would have done for me
At all events we carried our point
We got the loot
They took it from us and we were strong enough to get it back
Moran merely nodded as though satisfied with his decision and added Well what next mate
Well get back to the Bertha now and put to sea as soon as we can catch the tide
Ill send Jim and two of the other men across in the dory with Charlie
The rest of us will go around by the shore
Weve got to have a chinchin with Hoang if he dont get loose aboard there and fire the boat before we can get back
I dont propose taking these beachcombers back to Frisco with us
What will we do with the two prisoners
she asked
Let them go weve got their arms
The positions of the two were reversed
It was Wilbur who assumed control and direction of what went forward Moran taking his advice and relying upon his judgment
In accordance with Wilburs orders Charlie was carried aboard the dory which with two Chinamen at the oars and the ambergris stowed again into the cuddy at once set off for the schooner
Wilbur himself cut the ropes on the two prisoners and bade them shift for themselves
The rest of the party returned to the Bertha Millner around the wide sweep of the beach
It was only by high noon under the flogging of a merciless sun that the entire crew of the little schooner once more reassembled under the shadow of her stranded hulk
They were quite worn out and as soon as Charlie was lifted aboard and the ambergrisor as they spoke of it now the lootwas safely stowed in the cabin Wilbur allowed the Chinamen three or four hours rest
They had had neither breakfast nor dinner but their exhaustion was greater than their hunger and in a few moments the entire halfdozen were stretched out asleep on the forward deck in the shadow of the foresail raised for the purpose of sheltering them
However Wilbur and Moran sought out Hoang whom they found as they had left himbound upon the floor of the cabin
Now we have a talksavvy
Wilbur told him as he loosed the ropes about his wrists and ankles
We got our loot back from you old man and we got one of your men into the bargain
You woke up the wrong crowd Hoang when you went up against this outfit
Youre in a bad way my friend
Your junk is wrecked all your oil and blubber from the whale is lost four of your men have run away one is killed another one we caught and let go another one has been hamstrung and you yourself are our prisoner with your teeth filed down to your gums
Now continued Wilbur with the profoundest gravity I hope this will be a lesson to you
Dont try and get too much the next time
Just be content with what is yours by right or what you are strong enough to keep and dont try to fight with white people
Other coolies I dont say
But when you try to get the better of white people you are out of your class
The little beachcomber he was scarcely above five feet rubbed his chafed wrists and fixed Wilbur with his tiny twinkling eyes
What you do now
We go home
Im going to maroon you and your people here on this beach
You deserve that I should let you eat your fists by way of tableboard but Im no such dirt as you
When our men left the schooner they brought off with them a good share of our provisions
Ill leave them here for youand theres plenty of turtle and abalone to be had for the catching
Some of the American menofwar I believe come down to this bay for target practice twice a year and if we speak any on the way up well ask them to call here for castaways
Thats what Ill do for you and thats all
If you dont like it you can set out to march up the coast till you hit a town but I wouldnt advise you to try it
Now what have you got to say
Hoang was silent
His queue had become unbound for half its length and he plaited it anew winking his eyes thoughtfully
Well what do you say
said Moran
I lose face answered Hoang at length calmly
You lose face
What do you mean
I lose face he insisted then added I heap shamed
You fightee my China boy you catchee me
My boy no mo hab me fo bosssavvy
I go back him no likee me
Mebbe all same killee me
I lose faceno mo boss
What a herd of wild cattle
muttered Wilbur
Theres something in what he says dont you think mate
observed Moran bringing a braid over each shoulder and stroking it according to her habit
Well ask Jim about it decided Wilbur
But Jim at once confirmed Hoangs statement
Oh Kaigingh killum nogood boss fo sure he declared
Dont you think mate said Moran wed better take him up to Frisco with us
Weve had enough fighting and killing
So it was arranged that the defeated beachcomber the whipped buccaneer who had lost face and no longer dared look his men in the eye should be taken aboard
By four oclock next morning Wilbur had the hands at work digging the sand from around the Bertha Millners bow
The line by which she was to be warped off was run out to the ledge of the rock fresh water was taken on provisions for the marooned beach combers were cached upon the beach the dory was taken aboard gaskets were cast off and hatches battened down
At high tide all hands straining upon the warp the schooner was floated off and under touch of the lightest airs drew almost imperceptibly away from the land
They were quite an hour crawling out to the heads of the bay
But here the breeze was freshening
Moran took the wheel the flyingjib and staysail were set the wake began to whiten under the schooners stern the forefoot sang the Pacific opened out more and more and by 1230 oclock Moran put the wheel over and as the schooners bow swung to the northward cried to Wilbur Mate look your last of Magdalena Bay
Standing at her side Wilbur turned and swept the curve of the coast with a single glance
The vast heatscourged hoop of yellow sand the still smooth shield of indigo water with its beds of kelp had become insensibly dear to him
It was all familiar friendly and hospitable
Hardly an acre of that sweep of beach that did not hold the impress of his foot
There was the point near by the creek where he and Moran first landed to fill the watercasks and to gather abalones the creek itself where he had snared quail the sand spit with its whitened whales skull where he and Moran had beached the schooner and there last of all that spot of black over which still hung a haze of browngray smoke the charred ruins of the old Portuguese whalingcabin where they had outfought the beachcombers
For a moment Wilbur and Moran looked back without speaking
They stood on the quarterdeck in the shadow of the mainsail shut off from the sight of the schooners crew and for the instant quite alone
Well Moran its goodby to the old places isnt it
said Wilbur at length
Yes she said her deep voice pitched even deeper than usual
Mate great things have happened there
It doesnt look like a place for a Tong row with Chinese pirates though does it
he said but even as he spoke the words he guessed that that was not what he meant
Oh what did that amount to
she said with an impatient movement of her head
It was there that I first knew myself and knew that after all you were a man and I was a woman and that there was just usyou and Iin the world and that you loved me and I loved you and that nothing else was worth thinking of
Wilbur shut his hand down over hers as it gripped a spoke of the wheel
Moran I knew that long since he said
Such a month as this has been
Why I feel as though I had only begun to live since I began to love you
And you do mate
she answeredyou do love me and always will
Oh you dont know she went on interrupting his answer you havent a guess how the last two days have changed me
Something has happened hereand she put both her hands over her breast
Im all different here mate
Its all you inside here all you
And it hurts and Im proud that it does hurt
Oh
she cried of a sudden I dont know how to love yet and I do it very badly and I cant tell you how I feel because I cant even tell it to myself
But you must be good to me now
The deep voice trembled a little
Good to me mate and true to me mate because Ive only you and all of me is yours
Mate be good to me and always be kind to me
Im not Moran any more
Im not proud and strong and independent and I dont want to be lonely
I want youI want you always with me
Im just a woman now dearjust a woman that loves you with a heart shes just found
Wilbur could find no words to answer
There was something so pathetic and at the same time so noble in Morans complete surrender of herself and her dependence upon him her unquestioned trust in him and his goodness that he was suddenly smitten with awe at the sacredness of the obligation thus imposed on him
She was his now to have and to hold to keep to protect and to defendshe who was once so glorious of her strength of her savage isolation her inviolate pristine maidenhood
All words seemed futile and inadequate to him
She came close to him and put her hands upon his shoulders and looking him squarely in the eye said You do love me mate and you always will
Always Moran said Wilbur simply
He took her in his arms and she laid her cheek against his for a moment then took his head between her hands and kissed him
Two days passed
The Bertha Millner held steadily to her northward course Moran keeping her well in toward the land
Wilbur maintained a lookout from the crowsnest in the hope of sighting some white cruiser or battleship on her way south for targetpractice
In the cache of provisions he had left for the beachcombers he had inserted a message written by Hoang to the effect that they might expect to be taken off by a United States manofwar within the month
Hoang did not readily recover his loss of face
The Berthas Chinamen would have nothing to do with this member of a hostile Tong and the humiliated beachcomber kept almost entirely to himself sitting on the forecastlehead all day long smoking his suiyenhu and brooding silently to himself
Moran had taken the lump of ambergris from out Kitchells old hammock and had slung the hammock itself in the schooners waist and Charlie was made as comfortable as possible therein
They could do but little for him however and he was taken from time to time with spells of coughing that racked him with a dreadful agony
At length one noon just after Moran had taken the sun and had calculated that the Bertha was some eight miles to the southwest of San Diego she was surprised to hear Wilbur calling her sharply
She ran to him and found him standing in the waist by Charlies hammock
The Chinaman was dying and knew it
He was talking in a faint and feeble voice to Wilbur as she came up and was trying to explain to him that he was sorry he had deserted the schooner during the scare in the bay
Planty muchee solly he said China boy him heap flaid of Fengshui
When Fengshui no likee we then must go chopchop
Plenty much solly I leaveum schooner that night solly plenty savvy
Of course we savvy Charlie said Moran
You werent afraid when it came to fighting

Charlie nodded his head contentedly drawing a breath of satisfaction
Bimeby Hop Sing sendum body back China
He closed his eyes and lay for a long time worn out with the effort of speaking as if asleep
Suddenly he opened his eyes wide
You no flogettee horse
Four horses Charlie
Ill remember
He drooped once more only to rouse again at the end of a few minutes with Firstchop coffin plenty much silver and again a little later and very feebly Sixpieceeband musicChina musicfour pieceegongfour
I promise you Charlie said Wilbur
Now answered Charlienow I die
And the lowcaste Cantonese coolie with all the dignity and calmness of a Cicero composed himself for death
An hour later Wilbur and Moran knew that he was dead
Yet though they had never left the hammock they could not have told at just what moment he died
Later on that same afternoon Wilbur from the crowsnest saw the lighthouse on Point Loma and the huge rambling bulk of the Coronado Hotel spreading out and along the beach
It was the outpost of civilization
They were getting back to the world again
Within an hours ride of the hotel were San Diego railroads newspapers and policemen
Just off the hotel however Wilbur could discern the gleaming white hull of a United States manofwar
With the glass he could make her out to be one of the monitorsthe Monterey in all probability
After advising with Moran it was decided to put in to land
The report as to the castaways could be made to the Monterey and Charlies body forwarded to his Tong in San Francisco
In two hours time the schooner was well up and Wilbur stood by Morans side at the wheel
watching and studying the familiar aspect of Coronado Beach
Its a great winter resort he told her
I was down here with a party two years ago
Nothing has changed
You see that big sort of round wing Moran all full of windows
Thats the dining room
And theres the bathhouse and the bowlingalley
See the people on the beach and the girls in white duck skirts and look up there by the verandalet me take the glassyes theres a tallyho coach
Isnt it queer to get back to this sort of thing after Magdalena Bay and the beachcombers
Moran spun the wheel without reply and gave an order to Jim to ease off the foresheet
XII NEW CONDITIONS The winter season at the Hotel del Coronado had been unusually gay that year and the young lady who wrote the society news in diary form for one of the San Francisco weekly papers had held forth at much length upon the hotels unbroken succession of festivities
She had also noted that prominent among the newest arrivals had been Mr Nat Ridgeway of San Francisco who had brought down from the city aboard his elegant and sumptuously fitted yacht Petrel a jolly party composed largely of the seasons debutantes
To be mentioned in the latter category was Miss Josie Herrick whose lavender comingout tea at the beginning of the season was still a subject of comment among the gossipsand all the rest of it
The Petrel had been in the harbor but a few days and on this evening a dance was given at the hotel in honor of her arrival
It was to be a cotillon and Nat Ridgeway was going to lead with Josie Herrick
There had been a coaching party to Tia Juana that day and Miss Herrick had returned to the hotel only in time to dress
By 930 she emerged from the processwhich had involved her mother her younger sister her maid and one of the hotel chambermaidsa dainty firmcorseted little body all tulle white satin and highpiled hair
She carried Marechal Niel roses ordered by wire from Monterey and about an hour later when Ridgeway gave the nod to the waiting musicians and swung her off to the beat of a twostep there was not a more graceful little figure upon the floor of the incomparable round ballroom of the Coronado Hotel
The cotillon was a great success
The ensigns and younger officers of the monitorat that time anchored off the hotel attended in uniform and enough of the members of what was known in San Francisco as the dancing set were present to give the affair the necessary entrain
Even Jerry Haight who belonged more distinctly to the countryclub set and who had spent the early part of that winter shooting elk in Oregon was among the ranks of the rovers who grouped themselves about the draughty doorways and endeavored to appear unconscious each time Ridgeway gave the signal for a break
The figures had gone round the hall once
The first set was out again and as Ridgeway guided Miss Herrick by the rovers she looked over the array of shirtfronts searching for Jerry Haight
Do you see Mr
Haight
she asked of Ridgeway
I wanted to favor him this break
I owe him two already and hell never forgive me if I overlook him now
Jerry Haight had gone to the hotel office for a few moments rest and a cigarette and was nowhere in sight
But when the set broke and Miss Herrick despairing of Jerry had started out to favor one of the younger ensigns she suddenly jostled against him pushing his way eagerly across the floor in the direction of the musicians platform
Oh
she cried Mr Haight youve missed your chanceIve been looking for you
But Jerry did not hearhe seemed very excited
He crossed the floor almost running and went up on the platform where the musicians were meandering softly through the mazes of La Paloma and brought them to an abrupt silence
Here I say Haight
exclaimed Ridgeway who was near by you cant break up my figure like that
Gi me a call there on the bugle said Haight rapidly to the cornetist
Anything to make em keep quiet a moment
The cornetist sounded a couple of notes and the cotillon paused in the very act of the break
The shuffling of feet grew still and the conversation ceased
A diamond brooch had been found no doubt or some supper announcement was to be made
But Jerry Haight with a great sweep of his arm the forgotten cigarette between his fingers shouted out breathlessly Ross Wilbur is out in the office of the hotel
There was an instants silence and then a great shout
Wilbur found
Ross Wilbur come back from the dead
Ross Wilbur hunted for and bootlessly traced from Buenos Ayres in the south to the Aleutian Islands in the north
Ross Wilbur the puzzle of every detective bureau on the coast the subject of a thousand theories whose name had figured in the scareheads of every newspaper west of the Mississippi
Ross Wilbur seen at a fashionable tea and his club of an afternoon then suddenly blotted out from the world of men swallowed up and engulfed by the unknown with not so much as a button left behind
Ross Wilbur the suicide Ross Wilbur the murdered Ross Wilbur victim of a band of kidnappers the hero of some dreadful story that was never to be told the mystery the legendbehold he was there
Back from the unknown dropped from the clouds spewed up again from the bowels of the eartha veritable god from the machine who in a single instant was to disentangle all the unexplained complications of those past winter months
Here he comes
shouted Jerry his eyes caught by a group of men in full dress and gold lace who came tramping down the hall to the ballroom bearing a nondescript figure on their shoulders
Here he comesthe boys are bringing him in here
Oh
he cried turning to the musicians cant you play somethinganything
Hit it up for all youre worth
RidgewayNat look here
Ross was Yale y knowYale 95 aint we enough Yale men here to give him the yell
Out of all time and tune but with a vigor that made up for both the musicians banged into a patriotic air
Jerry standing on a chair that itself was standing on the platform led half a dozen frantic men in the long thunder of the Brekkekkekkek coex coex
Around the edges of the hall excited girls and chaperons themselves no less agitated were standing up on chairs and benches splitting their gloves and breaking their fans in their enthusiasm while every male dancer on the floorensigns in their goldfaced uniforms and rovers in starched and immaculate shirt bosomscheered and cheered and struggled with one another to shake hands with a man whom two of their number old Yale grads with memories of athletic triumphs yet in their mindscarried into that ballroom borne high upon their shoulders
And the hero of the occasion the centre of all this enthusiasm thus carried as if in triumph into this assembly in evening dress in white tulle and whiter kid odorous of delicate sachets and scarceperceptible perfumeswas a figure unhandsome and unkempt beyond description
His hair was long and hanging over his eyes
A thick uncaredfor beard concealed the mouth and chin
He was dressed in a Chinamans blouse and jeansthe latter thrust into slashed and tattered boots
The tan and weatherbeatings of nearly half a year of the tropics were spread over his face a partly healed scar disfigured one temple and cheekbone the hands to the very fingernails were gray with grime the jeans and blouse and boots were fouled with grease with oil with pitch and all manner of the dirt of an uncaredfor ship
And as the dancers of the cotillon pressed about and a hundred kidgloved hands stretched toward his own palms there fell from Wilburs belt upon the waxed floor of the ballroom the knife he had so grimly used in the fight upon the beach the ugly stains still blackening on the haft
There was no more cotillon that night
They put him down at last and in half a dozen sentences Wilbur told them of how he had been shanghaiedtold them of Magdalena Bay his fortune in the ambergris and the fight with the beachcombers
You people are going down there for targetpractice arent you
he said turning to one of the Montereys officers in the crowd about him
Yes
Well youll find the coolies there on the beach waiting for you
All but one he added grimly
We marooned six of them but the seventh didnt need to be marooned
They tried to plunder us of our boat but by  we made it interesting for em
I say steady old man
exclaimed Nat Ridgeway glancing nervously toward the girls in the surrounding group
This isnt Magdalena Bay you know
And for the first time Wilbur felt a genuine pang of disappointment and regret as he realized that it was not
Half an hour later Ridgeway drew him aside
I say Ross lets get out of here
You cant stand here talking all night
Jerry and you and I will go up to my rooms and we can talk there in peace
Ill order up three quarts of fizz and Oh rot your fizz
declared Wilbur
If you love me give me Christian tobacco
As they were going out of the ballroom Wilbur caught sight of Josie Herrick and breaking away from the others ran over to her
Oh
she cried breathless
To think and to think of your coming back after all
No I dont realize itI cant
It will take me until morning to find out that youve really come back
I just know now that Im happier than I ever was in my life before
Oh
she cried do I need to tell you how glad I am
Its just too splendid for words
Do you know I was thought to be the last person you had ever spoken to while alive and the reporters and alloh but we must have such a talk when all is quiet again
And our danceweve never had our dance
Ive got your card yet
Remember the one you wrote for me at the teaa facsimile of it was published in all the papers
You are going to be a hero when you get back to San Francisco
Oh Ross
Ross
she cried the tears starting to her eyes youve really come back and you are just as glad as I am arent youglad that youve come backcome back to me
Later on in Ridgeways room Wilbur told his story again more in detail to Ridgeway and Jerry
All but one portion of it
He could not make up his mind to speak to themthese society fellows clubmen and city bredof Moran
How he was going to order his life henceforwardhis life that he felt to be void of interest without herhe did not know
That was a question for later consideration
Well give another cotillon
exclaimed Ridgeway up in the citygive it for you Ross and youll lead
Itll be the event of the season
Wilbur uttered an exclamation of contempt
Ive done with that sort of foolery he answered
Nonsense why think well have it in your honor
Every smart girl in town will come and youll be the lion of You dont seem to understand
cried Wilbur impatiently
Do you think theres any fun in that for me now
Why man Ive fought fought with a naked dirk fought with a coolie who snapped at me like an apeand you talk to me of dancing and functions and german favors
It wouldnt do some of you people a bit of harm if you were shanghaied yourselves
That sort of life if it dont do anything else knocks a big bit of seriousness into you
You fellows make me sick he went on vehemently
As though there wasnt anything else to do but lead cotillons and get up new figures
Well what do you propose to do
asked Nat Ridgeway
Where are you going nowback to Magdalena Bay
No
Where then
Wilbur smote the table with his fist
Cuba
he cried
Ive got a crack little schooner out in the bay here and Ive got a hundred thousand dollars worth of loot aboard of her
Ive tried beachcombing for a while and now Ill try filibustering
It may be a crazy idea but its better than dancing
Id rather lead an expedition than a german and you can chew on that Nathaniel Ridgeway
Jerry looked at him as he stood there before them in the filthy reeking blouse and jeans the ragged boots and the mane of hair and tangled beard and remembered the Wilbur he used to knowthe Wilbur of the carefully creased trousers the satin scarfs and fancy waistcoats
Youre a different sort than when you went away Ross said Jerry
Right you are answered Wilbur
But I will venture a prophecy continued Jerry looking keenly at him
Ross you are a bornandbred city man
Its in the blood of you and the bones of you
Ill give you three years for this new notion of yours to wear itself out
You think just now youre going to spend the rest of your life as an amateur buccaneer
In three years at the outside youll be using your loot as you call it or the interest of it to pay your taxes and your tailor your pew rent and your club dues and youll be what the biographers call a respectable member of the community
Did you ever kill a man Jerry
asked Wilbur
No
Well you kill one some daykill him in a fair giveandtake fightand see how it makes you feel and what influence it has on you and then come back and talk to me
It was long after midnight
Wilbur rose
Well ring for a boy said Ridgeway and get you a room
I can fix you out with clothes enough in the morning  Wilbur stared in some surprise and then said Why Ive got the schooner to look after
I cant leave those coolies alone all night
You dont mean to say youre going on board at this time in the morning
Of course
Whybutbut youll catch your death of cold
Wilbur stared at Ridgeway then nodded helplessly and scratching his head said half aloud No whats the use I cant make em understand
Goodnight Ill see you in the morning
Well all come out and visit you on your yacht Ridgeway called after him but Wilbur did not hear
In answer to Wilburs whistle Jim came in with the dory and took him off to the schooner
Moran met him as he came over the side
I took the watch myself tonight and let the boy turn in she said
How is it ashore mate
Weve come back to the world of little things Moran said Wilbur
But well pull out of here in the morning and get back to the places where things are real
And thats a good hearing mate
Lets get up here on the quarterdeck added Wilbur
Ive something to propose to you
Moran laid an arm across his shoulder and the two walked aft
For half an hour Wilbur talked to her earnestly about his new idea of filibustering and as he told her of the war he warmed to the subject his face glowing his eyes sparkling
Suddenly however he broke off
But no
he exclaimed
You dont understand Moran
How can youyoure foreignborn
Its no affair of yours
Mate
mate
cried Moran her hands upon his shoulders
Its you who dont understanddont understand me
Dont you know cant you see
Your people are mine now
Im happy only in your happiness
You were rightthe best happiness is the happiness one shares
And your sorrows belong to me just as I belong to you dear
Your enemies are mine and your quarrels are my quarrels
She drew his head quickly toward her and kissed him
In the morning the two had made up their minds to a certain vague course of action
To get awayanywherewas their one aim
Moran was by nature a creature unfit for civilization and the love of adventure and the desire for action had suddenly leaped to life in Wilburs blood and was not to be resisted
They would get up to San Francisco dispose of their loot outfit the Bertha Millner as a filibuster and put to sea again
They had discussed the advisability of rounding the Horn in so small a ship as the Bertha Millner but Moran had settled that at once
Ive got to know her pretty well she told Wilbur
Shes sound as a nut
Only lets get away from this place
But toward ten oclock on the morning after their arrival off Coronado and just as they were preparing to get under way Hoang touched Wilburs elbow
Seeum lil onepiece smokeboat him come chopchop
In fact a little steamlaunch was rapidly approaching the schooner
In another instant she was alongside
Jerry Nat Ridgeway Josie Herrick and an elderly woman whom Wilbur barely knew as Miss Herricks married sister were aboard
Weve come off to see your yacht
cried Miss Herrick to Wilbur as the launch bumped along the schooners counter
Can we come aboard
She looked very pretty in her crisp pink shirtwaist her white duck skirt and white kid shoes her sailor hat tilted at a barely perceptible angle
The men were in white flannels and smart yachting suits
Can we come aboard
she repeated
Wilbur gasped and stared
Good Lord
he muttered
Oh come along he added desperately
The party came over the side
Oh my
said Miss Herrick blankly stopping short
The decks masts and rails of the schooner were shiny with a black coating of dirt and grease the sails were gray with grime a strangling odor of oil and tar of cooking and of opium of Chinese punk and drying fish pervaded all the air
In the waist Hoang and Jim bare to the belt their queues looped around their necks to be out of the way were stowing the dory and exchanging highpitched monosyllables
Miss Herricks sister had not come aboard
The three visitorsJerry Ridgeway and Josiestood nervously huddled together their elbows close in as if to avoid contact with the prevailing filth their immaculate white outing clothes detaching themselves violently against the squalor and sordid grime of the schooners background
Oh my
repeated Miss Herrick in dismay half closing her eyes
To think of what you must have been through
I thought you had some kind of a yacht
I had no idea it would be like this
And as she spoke Moran came suddenly upon the group from behind the foresail and paused in abrupt surprise her thumbs in her belt
She still wore mens clothes and was booted to the knee
The heavy blue woolen shirt was open at the throat the sleeves rolled halfway up her large white arms
In her belt she carried her haftless Scandinavian dirk
She was hatless as ever and her heavy fragrant cables of ryehued hair fell over her shoulders and breast to far below her belt
Miss Herrick started sharply and Moran turned an inquiring glance upon Wilbur
Wilbur took his resolution in both hands
Miss Herrick he said this is MoranMoran Sternersen
Moran took a step forward holding out her hand
Josie all bewildered put her tightgloved fingers into the calloused palm looking up nervously into Morans face
Im sure she said feebly almost breathlessly IIm sure Im very pleased to meet Miss Sternersen
It was long before the picture left Wilburs imagination
Josie Herrick petite gowned in white crisp from her maids grooming and Moran searover and daughter of a hundred Vikings towering above her booted and belted gravely clasping Josies hand in her own huge fist
XIII MORAN STERNERSEN San Francisco once more
For two days the Bertha Millner had been beating up the coast fighting her way against northerly winds butting into head seas
The warmth the stillness the placid drowsing quiet of Magdalena Bay steaming under the golden eye of a tropic heaven the white baked beach the bayheads striated with the mirage in the morning the coruscating sunset the enchanted mystery of the purple night with its sheen of stars and riding moon were now replaced by the hale and vigorous snorting of the Trades the roll of breakers to landward and the unremitting gallop of the unnumbered multitudes of graygreen seas careering silently past the schooner their crests occasionally hissing into brusque eruptions of white froth or smiting broad on under her counter showering her decks with a sprout of icy spray
It was cold at times thick fogs cloaked all the world of water
To the east a procession of bleak hills defiled slowly southward lighthouses were passed streamers of smoke on the western horizon marked the passage of steamships and once they met and passed close by a huge Cape Horner a great deepsea tramp all sails set and drawing rolling slowly and leisurely in seas that made the schooner dance
At last the Farallones looked over the oceans edge to the north then came the whistlingbuoy the Seal Rocks the Heads Point Reyes the Golden Gate flanked with the old red Presidio Lime Point with its watching cannon and by noon of a gray and boisterous day under a lusty wind and a slant of rain just five months after her departure the Bertha Millner let go her anchor in San Francisco Bay some few hundred yards off the Lifeboat Station
In this berth the schooner was still three or four miles from the city and the waterfront
But Moran detested any nearer approach to civilization and Wilbur himself was willing to avoid at least for one day the publicity which he believed the Berthas reappearance was sure to attract
He remembered too that the little boat carried with her a fortune of 100000 and decided that until it could be safely landed and stored it was not desirable that its existence should be known along the Front
For days weeks even Wilbur had looked eagerly forward to this return to his home
He had seen himself again in his former haunts in his club and in the houses along Pacific avenue where he was received but no sooner had the anchorchain ceased rattling in the Berthas hawsepipe than a strange revulsion came upon him
The new man that seemed to have so suddenly sprung to life within him the Wilbur who was the mate of the Bertha Millner the Wilbur who belonged to Moran believed that he could see nothing to be desired in city life
For him was the unsteady deck of a schooner and the great winds and the tremendous wheel of the oceans rim and the horizon that ever fled before his following prow so he told himself so he believed
What attractions could the city offer him
What amusements
what excitements
He had been flung off the smoothly spinning circumference of wellordered life out into the void
He had known romance and the spell of the great simple and primitive emotions he had sat down to eat with buccaneers he had seen the fierce quick leap of unleashed passions and had felt death swoop close at his nape and pass like a swift spurt of cold air
City life his old life had no charm for him now
Wilbur honestly believed that he was changed to his hearts core
He thought that like Moran he was henceforth to be a sailor of the sea a rover and he saw the rest of his existence passed with her aboard their faithful little schooner
They would have the whole round world as their playground they held the earth and the great seas in fief there was no one to let or to hinder
They two belonged to each other
Once outside the Heads again and they swept the land of cities and of little things behind them and they two were left alone once more alone in the great world of romance
About an hour after her arrival off the station while Hoang and the hands were furling the jib and foresail and getting the dory over the side Moran remarked to Wilbur Its good we came in when we did mate the glass is going down fast and the winds breezing up from the west were going to have a blow the tide will be going out in a little while and we never could have come in against wind and tide
Moran said Wilbur Im going ashoreinto the station here theres a telephone line there see the wires
I cant so much as turn my hand over before I have some shoregoing clothes
What do you suppose they would do to me if I appeared on Kearney Street in this outfit
Ill ring up Langley  Michaelsthey are the wholesale chemists in townand have their agent come out here and talk business to us about our ambergris
Weve got to pay the men their prizemoney then as soon as we get our own money in hand we can talk about overhauling and outfitting the Bertha
Moran refused to accompany him ashore and into the Lifeboat Station
Roofed houses were an object of suspicion to her
Already she had begun to be uneasy at the distant sight of the city of San Francisco Nob Telegraph Russian and Rincon hills all swarming with buildings and grooved with streets even the landlocked harbor fretted her
Wilbur could see she felt imprisoned confined
When he had pointed out the Palace Hotel to hera vast gray cube in the distance overtopping the surrounding roofsshe had sworn under her breath
And people can live there good heavens
Why not rabbitburrows and be done with it
Mate how soon can we be out to sea again
I hate this place
Wilbur found the captain of the Lifeboat Station in the act of sitting down to a dinner of boiled beef and cabbage
He was a strongly built welllooking man with the air more of a soldier than a sailor
He had already been studying the schooner through his front window and had recognized her and at once asked Wilbur news of Captain Kitchell
Wilbur told him as much of his story as was necessary but from the captains talk he gathered that the news of his return had long since been wired from Coronado and that it would be impossible to avoid a nine days notoriety
The captain of the station his name was Hodgson made Wilbur royally welcome insisted upon his dining with him and himself called up Langley  Michaels as soon as the meal was over
It was he who offered the only plausible solution of the mystery of the lifting and shaking of the schooner and the wrecking of the junk
Though Wilbur was not satisfied with Hodgsons explanation it was the only one he ever heard
When he had spoken of the matter Hodgson had nodded his head
Sulphurbottoms he said
Sulphurbottoms
Yes theyre a kind of rightwhale they get barnacles and a kind of marine lice on their backs and come up and scratch them selves against a ships keel just like a hog under a fence
When Wilburs business was done and he was making ready to return to the schooner Hodgson remarked suddenly Hear youve got a strapping fine girl aboard with you
Where did you fall in with her
and he winked and grinned
Wilbur started as though struck and took himself hurriedly away but the mans words had touched off in his brain a veritable mine of conjecture
Moran in Magdalena Bay was consistent congruous and fitted into her environment
But howhow was Wilbur to explain her to San Francisco and how could his behavior seem else than ridiculous to the men of his club and to the women whose dinner invitations he was wont to receive
They could not understand the change that had been wrought in him they did not know Moran the savage halftamed Valkyrie so suddenly become a woman
Hurry as he would the schooner could not be put to sea again within a fortnight
Even though he elected to live aboard in the meanwhile the very business of her preparation would call him to the city again and again
Moran could not be kept a secret
As it was all the world knew of her by now
On the other hand he could easily understand her position to her it seemed simplicity itself that they two who loved each other should sail away and pass their lives together upon the sea as she and her father had done before
Like most men Wilbur had to walk when he was thinking hard
He sent the dory back to the schooner with word to Moran that he would take a walk around the beach and return in an hour or two
He set off along the shore in the direction of Fort Mason the old redbrick fort at the entrance to the Golden Gate
At this point in the Presidio Government reservation the land is solitary
Wilbur followed the line of the beach to the old fort and there on the very threshold of the Western world at the very outpost of civilization sat down in the lee of the crumbling fortification and scene by scene reviewed the extraordinary events of the past six months
In front of him ran the narrow channel of the Golden Gate to his right was the bay and the city at his left the open Pacific
He saw himself the day of his advent aboard the Bertha in his top hat and frock coat saw himself later braking down at the windlass the Petrel within hailing distance
Then the pictures began to thicken fast the derelict bark Lady Letty rolling to her scuppers abandoned and lonely the boy in the wheelbox Kitchell wrenching open the desk in the captains stateroom Captain Sternersen buried at sea his false teeth upside down the black fury of the squall and Moran at the wheel Moran lying at full length on the deck getting the altitude of a star Magdalena Bay the sharkfishing the mysterious lifting and shuddering of the schooner the beachcombers junk with its staring red eyes Hoang naked to the waist gleaming with sweat and whaleoil the ambergris the race to beach the sinking schooner the nevertobeforgotten night when he and Moran had camped together on the beach Hoang taken prisoner and the hideous filing of his teeth the beachcombers silent and watchful behind their sand breastworks the Chinaman he had killed twitching and hiccoughing at his feet Moran turned Berserker bursting down upon him through a haze of smoke Charlie dying in the hammock aboard the schooner ordering his funeral with its fourpiecee horse Coronado the incongruous scene in the ballroom and last of all Josie Herrick in white duck and kid shoes giving her hand to Moran in her boots and belt hatless as ever her sleeves rolled up to above the elbows her white strong arm extended her ruddy face and pale milkblue eyes gravely observant her heavy braids yellow as ripening rye hanging over her shoulder and breast
A sudden explosion of cold wind striking down blanketwise and bewildering from out the west made Wilbur look up quickly
The gray sky seemed scudding along close overhead
The bay the narrow channel of the Golden Gate the outside ocean were all whitening with crests of waves
At his feet the huge green groundswells thundered to the attack of the forts granite foundations
Through the Gate the bay seemed rushing out to the Pacific
A bewildered gull shot by tacking and slanting against the gusts that would drive it out to sea
Evidently the storm was not far off
Wilbur rose to his feet and saw the Bertha Millner close in unbridled and free as a runaway horse headed directly for the open sea and rushing on with all the impetus of wind and tide
XIV THE OCEAN IS CALLING FOR YOU A little while after Wilbur had set off for the station while Moran was making the last entries in the logbook seated at the table in the cabin Jim appeared at the door
Well she said looking up
China boy him want go asho plenty big seeum flen up Chinatown in um city
Shore leave is it
said Moran
You deserted once before without even saying goodby and my hand in the fire youll come back this time dotty with opium
Get away with you
Well have men aboard here in a few days
Can go
inquired Jim suavely
I said so
Report our arrival to your Six Companies
Hoang rowed Jim and the coolies ashore and then returned to the schooner with the dory and streamed her astern
As he passed the cabin door on his way forward Moran hailed him
I thought you went ashore
she cried
Heap flaid he answered
Him other boy go up Chinatown him tell Sam Yup I tink Sam Yup alla same killee me
I no leaveum ship two thlee day bimeby I go Olegon
I stay topside ship
You wantum cook
I cook plenty fine standum watch for you
Indeed ever since leaving Coronado the exbeachcomber had made himself very useful about the schooner had been in fact obsequiousness itself and seemed to be particularly desirous of gaining the goodwill of the Berthas officers
He understood pigeon English better than Jim and spoke it even better than Charlie had done
He acted the part of interpreter between Wilbur and the hands even turned to in the galley upon occasion and of his own accord offered to give the vessel a coat of paint above the waterline
Moran turned back to her log and Hoang went forward
Standing on the forward deck he looked after the Berthas coolies until they disappeared behind a row of pine trees on the Presidio Reservation going cityward
Wilbur was nowhere in sight
For a longtime Hoang studied the Lifeboat Station narrowly while he made a great show of coiling a length of rope
The station was just out of hailing distance
Nobody seemed stirring
The whole shore and back land thereabout was deserted the edge of the city was four miles distant
Hoang returned to the forecastlehatch and went below groping under his bunk in his dittybox
Well what is it
exclaimed Moran a moment later as the beach comber entered the cabin and shut the door behind him
Hoang did not answer but she did not need to repeat the question
In an instant Moran knew very well what he had come for
God
she exclaimed under her breath springing to her feet
Why didnt we think of this
Hoang slipped his knife from the sleeve of his blouse
For an instant the old imperiousness the old savage pride and anger leaped again in Morans breastthen died away forever
She was no longer the same Moran of that first fight on board the schooner when the beachcombers had plundered her of her loot
Only a few weeks ago and she would have fought with Hoang without hesitation and without mercy would have wrenched a leg from the table and brained him where he stood
But she had learned since to know what it meant to be dependent to rely for protection upon some one who was stronger than she to know her weakness to know that she was at last a woman and to be proud of it
She did not fight she had no thought of fighting
Instinctively she cried aloud MatemateOh mate where are you
Help me
and Hoangs knife nailed the words within her throat
The loot was in a brassbound chest under one of the cabins bunks stowed in two gunnybags
Hoang drew them out knotted the two together and slinging them over his shoulder regained the deck
He looked carefully at the angry sky and swelling seas noting the direction of the wind and set of the tide then went forward and cast the anchorchains from the windlass in such a manner that the schooner must inevitably wrench free with the first heavy strain
The dory was still tugging at the line astern
Hoang dropped the sacks in the boat swung himself over the side and rowed calmly toward the stations wharf
If any notion of putting to sea with the schooner had entered the obscure perverted cunning of his mind he had almost instantly rejected it
Chinatown was his aim once there and under the protection of his Tong Hoang knew that he was safe
He knew the hidingplaces that the See Yup Association provided for its membershiding places whose very existence was unknown to the police of the White Devil
No one interruptedno one even noticedhis passage to the station
At best it was nothing more than a coolie carrying a couple of gunnysacks across his shoulder
Two hours later Hoang was lost in San Franciscos Chinatown
          At the sight of the schooner sweeping out to sea Wilbur was for an instant smitten rigid
What had happened
Where was Moran
Why was there nobody on board
A swift sharp sense of some unnamed calamity leaped suddenly at his throat
Then he was aware of a crattering of hoofs along the road that led to the fort
Hodgson threw himself from one of the horses that were used in handling the surfboat and ran to him hatless and panting
My God
he shouted
Look your schooner do you see her
She broke away after Id started to tell youto tell youto tell youyour girl there on boardIt was horrible
Is she all right
cried Wilbur at top voice for the clamor of the gale was increasing every second
All right
No theyve killed hersomebodythe coolies I thinkknifed her
I went out to ask you people to come into the station to have supper with me Killed herkilled her
Who
I dont believe you Waitto have supper with me and I found her there on the cabin floor
She was still breathing
I carried her up on deckthere was nobody else aboard
I carried her up and laid her on the deckand she died there
Just now I came after you to tell you and Good God Almighty man
who killed her
Where is she
Ohbut of course it isnt true
How did you know
Moran killed
Moran killed
And the schooner broke away after I started
Moran killed
Butbutshes not dead yet well have to see She died on the deck I brought her up and laid her on How do you know shes dead
Where is she
Come on well go right back to herto the station
Shes on boardout there
Wherewhere is she
My God man tell me where she is
Out there aboard the schooner
I brought her up on deckI left her on the schooneron the deckshe was stabbed in the throat and then came after you to tell you
Then the schooner broke away while I was coming shes drifting out to sea now
Where is she
Where is she
Whothe girlthe schoonerwhich one
The girl is on the schoonerand the schoonerthats her right thereshes drifting out to sea
Wilbur put both hands to his temples closing his eyes
Ill go back
exclaimed Hodgson
Well have the surfboat out and get after her well bring the body back
No no
cried Wilbur its betterthis way
Leave her let her goshes going out to sea again
But the schooner wont live two hours outside in this weather shell go down
Its betterthat waylet her go
I want it so
I cant stay
cried the other again
If the patrol should sig storm coming up and Ive got to be at my station
Wilbur did not answer he was watching the schooner
I cant stay
cried the other again
If the patrol should signalI cant stop here I must be on duty
Come back you cant do anything
No
I have got to go
Hodgson ran back swung himself on the horse and rode away at a furious gallop inclining his head against the gusts
And the schooner in a world of flying spray white scud and driving spoondrift her cordage humming her forefoot churning the flag at her peak straining stiff in the gale came up into the narrow passage of the Golden Gate riding high upon the outgoing tide
On she came swinging from crest to crest of the waves that kept her company and that ran to meet the ocean shouting and calling out beyond there under the low scudding clouds
Wilbur had climbed to the top of the old fort
Erect upon its granite ledge he stood and watched and waited
Not once did the Bertha Millner falter in her race
Like an unbitted horse all restraint shaken off she ran free toward the ocean as to her pastureland
She came nearer nearer rising and rolling with the seas her bowsprit held due west pointing like a finger out to sea to the westout to the world of romance
And then at last as the little vessel drew opposite the old fort and passed not one hundred yards away Wilbur watching from the rampart saw Moran lying upon the deck with outstretched arms and calm upturned face lying upon the deck of that lonely fleeing schooner as upon a bed of honor still and calm her great braids smooth upon her breast her arms wide alone with the sea alone in death as she had been in life
She passed out of his life as she had come into italone upon a derelict ship abandoned to the sea
She went out with the tide out with the storms out out out to the great gray Pacific that knew her and loved her and that shouted and called for her and thundered in the joy of her as she came to meet him like a bride to meet a bridegroom
Goodby Moran
shouted Wilbur as she passed
Goodby good by Moran
You were not for menot for me
The ocean is calling for you dear dont you hear him
Dont you hear him
Goodby goodby goodby
The schooner swept by shot like an arrow through the swirling currents of the Golden Gate and dipped and bowed and courtesied to the Pacific that reached toward her his myriad curling fingers
They infolded her held her close and drew her swiftly swiftly out to the great heaving bosom tumultuous and beating in its mighty joy its savage exultation of possession
Wilbur stood watching
The little schooner lessened in the distancebecame a shadow in mist and flying spraya shadow moving upon the face of the great waste of water
Fainter and fainter she grew vanished reappeared was heaved up againa mere speck upon the western skya speck that dwindled and dwindled then slowly melted away into the gray of the horizon
