At a glance he might have been mistaken for a tramp but he was truly seeking work
He was intensely eager to belong somewhere and to be attached to almost any enterprise that would furnish him food and clothing
Long before he came in sight of the camp of the Grand Rapids Lumber Company he could hear the cheery voices of the men the neighing of the horses and could scent the tempting odors of cooking food
A feeling of homeless friendlessness swept over him in a sickening wave
Without stopping to think he turned into the newly made road and followed it to the camp where the gang was making ready for supper and bed
The scene was intensely attractive
The thickness of the swamp made a dark massive background below while above towered gigantic trees
The men were calling jovially back and forth as they unharnessed tired horses that fell into attitudes of rest and crunched in deep content the grain given them
Duncan the brawny Scotch headteamster lovingly wiped the flanks of his big bays with handfuls of pawpaw leaves as he softly whistled O wha will be my dearie O
and a cricket beneath the leaves at his feet accompanied him
The green wood fire hissed and crackled merrily
Wreathing tongues of flame wrapped around the big black kettles and when the cook lifted the lids to plunge in his testingfork gusts of savory odors escaped
Freckles approached him
I want to speak with the Boss he said
The cook glanced at him and answered carelessly He cant use you
The color flooded Freckles face but he said simply If you will be having the goodness to point him out we will give him a chance to do his own talking
With a shrug of astonishment the cook led the way to a rough board table where a broad squareshouldered man was bending over some accountbooks
Mr McLean heres another man wanting to be taken on the gang I suppose he said
All right came the cheery answer
I never needed a good man more than I do just now
The manager turned a page and carefully began a new line
No use of your bothering with this fellow volunteered the cook
He hasnt but one hand
The flush on Freckles face burned deeper
His lips thinned to a mere line
He lifted his shoulders took a step forward and thrust out his right arm from which the sleeve dangled empty at the wrist
That will do Sears came the voice of the Boss sharply
I will interview my man when I finish this report
He turned to his work while the cook hurried to the fires
Freckles stood one instant as he had braced himself to meet the eyes of the manager then his arm dropped and a wave of whiteness swept him
The Boss had not even turned his head
He had used the possessive
When he said my man the hungry heart of Freckles went reaching toward him
The boy drew a quivering breath
Then he whipped off his old hat and beat the dust from it carefully
With his left hand he caught the right sleeve wiped his sweaty face and tried to straighten his hair with his fingers
He broke a spray of ironwort beside him and used the purple bloom to beat the dust from his shoulders and limbs
The Boss busy over his report was nevertheless vaguely alive to the toilet being made behind him and scored one for the man
McLean was a Scotchman
It was his habit to work slowly and methodically
The men of his camps never had known him to be in a hurry or to lose his temper
Discipline was inflexible but the Boss was always kind
His habits were simple
He shared camp life with his gangs
The only visible signs of wealth consisted of a big shimmering diamond stone of ice and fire that glittered and burned on one of his fingers and the dainty beautiful thoroughbred mare he rode between camps and across the country on business
No man of McLeans gangs could honestly say that he ever had been overdriven or underpaid
The Boss never had exacted any deference from his men yet so intense was his personality that no man of them ever had attempted a familiarity
They all knew him to be a thorough gentleman and that in the great timber city several millions stood to his credit
He was the only son of that McLean who had sent out the finest ships ever built in Scotland
That his son should carry on this business after the fathers death had been his ambition
He had sent the boy through the universities of Oxford and Edinburgh and allowed him several years travel before he should attempt his first commission for the firm
Then he was ordered to southern Canada and Michigan to purchase a consignment of tall straight timber for masts and south to Indiana for oak beams
The young man entered these mighty forests parts of which lay untouched since the dawn of the morning of time
The clear cool pungent atmosphere was intoxicating
The intense silence like that of a great empty cathedral fascinated him
He gradually learned that to the shy wood creatures that darted across his path or peeped inquiringly from leafy ambush he was brother
He found himself approaching with a feeling of reverence those majestic trees that had stood through ages of sun wind and snow
Soon it became difficult to fell them
When he had filled his order and returned home he was amazed to learn that in the swamps and forests he had lost his heart and it was callingforever calling him
When he inherited his fathers property he promptly disposed of it and with his mother founded a home in a splendid residence in the outskirts of Grand Rapids
With three partners he organized a lumber company
His work was to purchase fell and ship the timber to the mills
Marshall managed the milling process and passed the lumber to the factory
From the lumber Barthol made beautiful and useful furniture which Uptegrove scattered all over the world from a big wholesale house
Of the thousands who saw their faces reflected on the polished surfaces of that furniture and found comfort in its use few there were to whom it suggested mighty forests and trackless swamps and the man big of soul and body who cut his way through them and with the eye of experience doomed the proud trees that were now entering the homes of civilization for service
When McLean turned from his finished report he faced a young man yet under twenty tall spare heavily framed closely freckled and redhaired with a homely Irish face but in the steady gray eyes straightly meeting his searching ones of blue there was unswerving candor and the appearance of longing not to be ignored
He was dressed in the roughest of farm clothing and seemed tired to the point of falling
You are looking for work
questioned McLean
Yis answered Freckles
I am very sorry said the Boss with genuine sympathy in his every tone but there is only one man I want at presenta hardy big fellow with a stout heart and a strong body
I hoped that you would do but I am afraid you are too young and scarcely strong enough
Freckles stood hat in hand watching McLean
And what was it you thought I might be doing
he asked
The Boss could scarcely repress a start
Somewhere before accident and poverty there had been an ancestor who used cultivated English even with an accent
The boy spoke in a mellow Irish voice sweet and pure
It was scarcely definite enough to be called brogue yet there was a trick in the turning of the sentence the wrong sound of a letter here and there that was almost irresistible to McLean and presaged a misuse of infinitives and possessives with which he was very familiar and which touched him nearly
He was of foreign birth and despite years of alienation in times of strong feeling he committed inherited sins of accent and construction
Its no childs job answered McLean
I am the field manager of a big lumber company
We have just leased two thousand acres of the Limberlost
Many of these trees are of great value
We cant leave our camp six miles south for almost a year yet so we have blazed a trail and strung barbed wires securely around this lease
Before we return to our work I must put this property in the hands of a reliable brave strong man who will guard it every hour of the day and sleep with one eye open at night
I shall require the entire length of the trail to be walked at least twice each day to make sure that our lines are up and that no one has been trespassing
Freckles was leaning forward absorbing every word with such intense eagerness that he was beguiling the Boss into explanations he had never intended making
But why wouldnt that be the finest job in the world for me
he pleaded
I am never sick
I could walk the trail twice three times every day and Id be watching sharp all the while
Its because you are scarcely more than a boy and this will be a trying job for a workhardened man answered McLean
You see in the first place you would be afraid
In stretching our lines we killed six rattlesnakes almost as long as your body and as thick as your arm
Its the price of your life to start through the marshgrass surrounding the swamp unless you are covered with heavy leather above your knees
You should be able to swim in case high water undermines the temporary bridge we have built where Sleepy Snake Creek enters the swamp
The fall and winter changes of weather are abrupt and severe while I would want strict watch kept every day
You would always be alone and I dont guarantee what is in the Limberlost
It is lying here as it has lain since the beginning of time and it is alive with forms and voices
I dont pretend to say what all of them come from but from a few slinking shapes Ive seen and hairraising yells Ive heard Id rather not confront their owners myself and I am neither weak nor fearful
Worst of all any man who will enter the swamp to mark and steal timber is desperate
One of my employees at the south camp John Carter compelled me to discharge him for a number of serious reasons
He came here entered the swamp alone and succeeded in locating and marking a number of valuable trees that he was endeavoring to sell to a rival company when we secured the lease
He has sworn to have these trees if he has to die or to kill others to get them and he is a man that the strongest would not care to meet
But if he came to steal trees wouldnt he bring teams and men enough that all anyone could do would be to watch and be after you
queried the boy
Yes replied McLean
Then why couldnt I be watching just as closely and coming as fast as an older stronger man
asked Freckles
Why by George you could
exclaimed McLean
I dont know as the size of a man would be half so important as his grit and faithfulness come to think of it
Sit on that log there and we will talk it over
What is your name
Freckles shook his head at the proffer of a seat and folding his arms stood straight as the trees around him
He grew a shade whiter but his eyes never faltered
Freckles
he said
Good enough for everyday laughed McLean but I scarcely can put Freckles on the companys books
Tell me your name
I havent any name replied the boy
I dont understand said McLean
I was thinking from the voice and the face of you that you wouldnt said Freckles slowly
Ive spent more time on it than I ever did on anything else in all me life and I dont understand
Does it seem to you that anyone would take a newborn baby and row over it until it was bruised black cut off its hand and leave it out in a bitter night on the steps of a charity home to the care of strangers
Thats what somebody did to me
McLean stared aghast
He had no reply ready and presently in a low voice he suggested And after
The Home people took me in and I was there the full legal age and several years over
For the most part we were a lot of little Irishmen together
They could always find homes for the other children but nobody would ever be wanting me on account of me arm
Were they kind to you
McLean regretted the question the minute it was asked
I dont know answered Freckles
The reply sounded so hopeless even to his own ears that he hastened to qualify it by adding You see its like this sir
Kindnesses that people are paid to lay off in job lots and that belong equally to several hundred others aint going to be soaking into any one fellow so much
Go on said McLean nodding comprehendingly
Theres nothing worth the taking of your time to tell replied Freckles
The Home was in Chicago and I was there all me life until three months ago
When I was too old for the training they gave to the little children they sent me to the closest ward school as long as the law would let them but I was never like any of the other children and they all knew it
Id to go and come like a prisoner and be working around the Home early and late for me board and clothes
I always wanted to learn mighty bad but I was glad when that was over
Every few days all me life Id to be called up looked over and refused a home and love on account of me hand and ugly face but it was all the home Id ever known and I didnt seem to belong to any place else
Then a new superintendent was put in
He wasnt for being like any of the others and he swore hed weed me out the first thing he did
He made a plan to send me down the State to a man he said he knew who needed a boy
He wasnt for remembering to tell that man that I was a hand short and he knocked me down the minute he found I was the boy who had been sent him
Between noon and that evening he and his son close my age had me in pretty much the same shape in which I was found in the beginning so I lay awake that night and ran away
Id like to have squared me account with that boy before I left but I didnt dare for fear of waking the old man and I knew I couldnt handle the two of them but Im hoping to meet him alone some day before I die
McLean tugged at his mustache to hide the smile on his lips but he liked the boy all the better for this confession
I didnt even have to steal clothes to get rid of starting in me Home ones Freckles continued for they had already taken all me clean neat things for the boy and put me into his rags and that went almost as sore as the beatings for where I was we were always kept tidy and sweetsmelling anyway
I hustled clear into this State before I learned that man couldnt have kept me if hed wanted to
When I thought I was good and away from him I commenced hunting work but it is with everybody else just as it is with you sir
Big strong whole men are the only ones for being wanted
I have been studying over this matter answered McLean
I am not so sure but that a man no older than you and similar in every way could do this work very well if he were not a coward and had it in him to be trustworthy and industrious
Freckles came forward a step
If you will give me a job where I can earn me food clothes and a place to sleep he said if I can have a Boss to work for like other men and a place I feel Ive a right to I will do precisely what you tell me or die trying
He spoke so convincingly that McLean believed although in his heart he knew that to employ a stranger would be wretched business for a man with the interests he had involved
Very well the Boss found himself answering I will enter you on my pay rolls
Well have supper and then I will provide you with clean clothing wadingboots the wiremending apparatus and a revolver
The first thing in the morning I will take you the length of the trail myself and explain fully what I want done
All I ask of you is to come to me at once at the south camp and tell me as a man if you find this job too hard for you
It will not surprise me
It is work that few men would perform faithfully
What name shall I put down
Freckles gaze never left McLeans face and the Boss saw the swift spasm of pain that swept his lonely sensitive features
I havent any name he said stubbornly no more than one somebody clapped on to me when they put me on the Home books with not the thought or care theyd name a house cat
Ive seen how they enter those poor little abandoned devils often enough to know
What they called me is no more my name than it is yours
I dont know what mine is and I never will but I am going to be your man and do your work and Ill be glad to answer to any name you choose to call me
Wont you please be giving me a name Mr
McLean
The Boss wheeled abruptly and began stacking his books
What he was thinking was probably what any other gentleman would have thought in the circumstances
With his eyes still downcast and in a voice harsh with huskiness he spoke
I will tell you what we will do my lad he said
My father was my ideal man and I loved him better than any other I have ever known
He went out five years ago but that he would have been proud to leave you his name I firmly believe
If I give to you the name of my nearest kin and the man I loved bestwill that do
Freckles rigid attitude relaxed suddenly
His head dropped and big tears splashed on the soiled calico shirt
McLean was not surprised at the silence for he found that talking came none too easily just then
All right he said
I will write it on the rollJames Ross McLean
Thank you mightily said Freckles
That makes me feel almost as if I belonged already
You do said McLean
Until someone armed with every right comes to claim you you are mine
Now come and take a bath have some supper and go to bed
As Freckles followed into the lights and sounds of the camp his heart and soul were singing for joy
CHAPTER II Wherein Freckles Proves His Mettle and Finds Friends Next morning found Freckles in clean whole clothing fed and rested
Then McLean outfitted him and gave him careful instruction in the use of his weapon
The Boss showed him around the timberline and engaged him a place to board with the family of his head teamster Duncan whom he had brought from Scotland with him and who lived in a small clearing he was working out between the swamp and the corduroy
When the gang was started for the south camp Freckles was left to guard a fortune in the Limberlost
That he was under guard himself those first weeks he never knew
Each hour was torture to the boy
The restricted life of a great city orphanage was the other extreme of the world compared with the Limberlost
He was afraid for his life every minute
The heat was intense
The heavy wadingboots rubbed his feet until they bled
He was sore and stiff from his long tramp and outdoor exposure
The seven miles of trail was agony at every step
He practiced at night under the direction of Duncan until he grew sure in the use of his revolver
He cut a stout hickory cudgel with a knot on the end as big as his fist this never left his hand
What he thought in those first days he himself could not recall clearly afterward
His heart stood still every time he saw the beautiful marshgrass begin a sinuous waving AGAINST the play of the wind as McLean had told him it would
He bolted half a mile with the first boom of the bittern and his hat lifted with every yelp of the sheitpoke
Once he saw a lean shadowy form following him and fired his revolver
Then he was frightened worse than ever for fear it might have been Duncans collie
The first afternoon that he found his wires down and he was compelled to plunge knee deep into the black swampmuck to restring them he became so ill from fear and nervousness that he scarcely could control his shaking hand to do the work
With every step he felt that he would miss secure footing and be swallowed in that clinging sea of blackness
In dumb agony he plunged forward clinging to the posts and trees until he had finished restringing and testing the wire
He had consumed much time
Night closed in
The Limberlost stirred gently then shook herself growled and awoke around him
There seemed to be a great owl hooting from every hollow tree and a little one screeching from every knothole
The bellowing of big bullfrogs was not sufficiently deafening to shut out the wailing of whippoorwills that seemed to come from every bush
Nighthawks swept past him with their shivering cry and bats struck his face
A prowling wildcat missed its catch and screamed with rage
A straying fox bayed incessantly for its mate
The hair on the back of Freckles neck arose as bristles and his knees wavered beneath him
He could not see whether the dreaded snakes were on the trail or in the pandemonium hear the rattle for which McLean had cautioned him to listen
He stood motionless in an agony of fear
His breath whistled between his teeth
The perspiration ran down his face and body in little streams
Something big black and heavy came crashing through the swamp close to him and with a yell of utter panic Freckles ranhow far he did not know but at last he gained control over himself and retraced his steps
His jaws set stiffly and the sweat dried on his body
When he reached the place from which he had started to run he turned and with measured steps made his way down the line
After a time he realized that he was only walking so he faced that sea of horrors again
When he came toward the corduroy the cudgel fell to test the wire at each step
Sounds that curdled his blood seemed to encompass him and shapes of terror to draw closer and closer
Fear had so gained the mastery that he did not dare look behind him and just when he felt that he would fall dead before he ever reached the clearing came Duncans rolling call Freckles
Freckles
A shuddering sob burst in the boys dry throat but he only told Duncan that finding the wire down had caused the delay
The next morning he started on time
Day after day with his heart pounding he ducked dodged ran when he could and fought when he was brought to bay
If he ever had an idea of giving up no one knew it for he clung to his job without the shadow of wavering
All these things in so far as he guessed them Duncan who had been set to watch the first weeks of Freckles work carried to the Boss at the south camp but the innermost exquisite torture of the thing the big Scotchman never guessed and McLean with his finer perceptions came only a little closer
After a few weeks when Freckles learned that he was still living that he had a home and the very first money he ever had possessed was safe in his pockets he began to grow proud
He yet side stepped dodged and hurried to avoid being late again but he was gradually developing the fearlessness that men ever acquire of dangers to which they are hourly accustomed
His heart seemed to be leaping when his first rattler disputed the trail with him but he mustered courage to attack it with his club
After its head had been crushed he mastered an Irishmans inborn repugnance for snakes sufficiently to cut off its rattles to show Duncan
With this victory his greatest fear of them was gone
Then he began to realize that with the abundance of food in the swamp fleshhunters would not come on the trail and attack him and he had his revolver for defence if they did
He soon learned to laugh at the big floppy birds that made horrible noises
One day watching behind a tree he saw a crane solemnly performing a few measures of a belated nuptial songanddance with his mate
Realizing that it was intended in tenderness no matter how it appeared the lonely starved heart of the boy sympathized with them
Before the first month passed he was fairly easy about his job by the next he rather liked it
Nature can be trusted to work her own miracle in the heart of any man whose daily task keeps him alone among her sights sounds and silences
When day after day the only thing that relieved his utter loneliness was the companionship of the birds and beasts of the swamp it was the most natural thing in the world that Freckles should turn to them for friendship
He began by instinctively protecting the weak and helpless
He was astonished at the quickness with which they became accustomed to him and the disregard they showed for his movements when they learned that he was not a hunter while the club he carried was used more frequently for their benefit than his own
He scarcely could believe what he saw
From the effort to protect the birds and animals it was only a short step to the possessive feeling and with that sprang the impulse to caress and provide
Through fall when brooding was finished and the upland birds sought the swamp in swarms to feast on its seeds and berries Freckles was content with watching them and speculating about them
Outside of half a dozen of the very commonest they were strangers to him
The likeness of their actions to humanity was an hourly surprise
When black frost began stripping the Limberlost cutting the ferns shearing the vines from the trees mowing the succulent green things of the swale and setting the leaves swirling down he watched the departing troops of his friends with dismay
He began to realize that he would be left alone
He made especial efforts toward friendliness with the hope that he could induce some of them to stay
It was then that he conceived the idea of carrying food to the birds for he saw that they were leaving for lack of it but he could not stop them
Day after day flocks gathered and departed by the time the first snow whitened his trail around the Limberlost there were left only the little blackandwhite juncos the sapsuckers yellowhammers a few patriarchs among the flaming cardinals the blue jays the crows and the quail
Then Freckles began his wizard work
He cleared a space of swale and twice a day he spread a birds banquet
By the middle of December the strong winds of winter had beaten most of the seed from the grass and bushes
The snow fell covering the swamp and food was very scarce and difficult to find
The birds scarcely waited until Freckles back was turned to attack his provisions
In a few weeks they flew toward the clearing to meet him
During the bitter weather of January they came halfway to the cabin every morning and fluttered around him as doves all the way to the feedingground
Before February they were so accustomed to him and so hungerdriven that they would perch on his head and shoulders and the saucy jays would try to pry into his pockets
Then Freckles added to wheat and crumbs every scrap of refuse food he could find at the cabin
He carried to his pets the parings of apples turnips potatoes stray cabbageleaves and carrots and tied to the bushes meatbones having scraps of fat and gristle
One morning coming to his feedingground unusually early he found a gorgeous cardinal and a rabbit side by side sociably nibbling a cabbageleaf and that instantly gave to him the idea of cracking nuts from the store he had gathered for Duncans children for the squirrels in the effort to add them to his family
Soon he had them comingred gray and black then he became filled with a vast impatience that he did not know their names or habits
So the winter passed
Every week McLean rode to the Limberlost never on the same day or at the same hour
Always he found Freckles at his work faithful and brave no matter how severe the weather
The boys earnings constituted his first money and when the Boss explained to him that he could leave them safe at a bank and carry away a scrap of paper that represented the amount he went straight on every payday and made his deposit keeping out barely what was necessary for his board and clothing
What he wanted to do with his money he did not know but it gave to him a sense of freedom and power to feel that it was thereit was his and he could have it when he chose
In imitation of McLean he bought a small pocket accountbook in which he carefully set down every dollar he earned and every penny he spent
As his expenses were small and the Boss paid him generously it was astonishing how his little hoard grew
That winter held the first hours of real happiness in Freckles life
He was free
He was doing a mans work faithfully through every rigor of rain snow and blizzard
He was gathering a wonderful strength of body paying his way and saving money
Every man of the gang and of that locality knew that he was under the protection of McLean who was a power this had the effect of smoothing Freckles path in many directions
Mrs Duncan showed him that individual kindness for which his hungry heart was longing
She had a hot drink ready for him when he came from a freezing day on the trail
She knit him a heavy mitten for his left hand and devised a way to sew and pad the right sleeve that protected the maimed arm in bitter weather
She patched his clothingfrequently torn by the wireand saved kitchen scraps for his birds not because she either knew or cared anything about them but because she herself was close enough to the swamp to be touched by its utter loneliness
When Duncan laughed at her for this she retorted My God mannie if Freckles hadna the birds and the beasts he would be always alone
It was never meant for a human being to be so solitary
Hed get touched in the head if he hadna them to think for and to talk to
How much answer do ye think he gets to his talkin lass
laughed Duncan
He gets the answer that keeps the eye bright the heart happy and the feet walking faithful the rough path hes set them in answered Mrs Duncan earnestly
Duncan walked away appearing very thoughtful
The next morning he gave an ear from the corn he was shelling for his chickens to Freckles and told him to carry it to his wild chickens in the Limberlost
Freckles laughed delightedly
Me chickens
he said
Why didnt I ever think of that before
Of course they are
They are just little brightly colored cocks and hens
But wild is no good
What would you say to me wild chickens being a good deal tamer than yours here in your yard
Hoot lad
cried Duncan
Make yours light on your head and eat out of your hands and pockets challenged Freckles
Go and tell your fairy tales to the wee people
Theyre juist brash on believin things said Duncan
Ye canna invent any story too big to stop them from callin for a bigger
I dare you to come see
retorted Freckles
Take ye
said Duncan
If ye make juist ane bird licht on your heid or eat frae your hand ye are free to help yoursel to my corncrib and wheat bin the rest of the winter
Freckles sprang in air and howled in glee
Oh Duncan
Youre too aisy he cried
When will you come
Ill come next Sabbath said Duncan
And Ill believe the birds of the Limberlost are tame as barnyard fowl when I see it and no sooner
After that Freckles always spoke of the birds as his chickens and the Duncans followed his example
The very next Sabbath Duncan with his wife and children followed Freckles to the swamp
They saw a sight so wonderful it will keep them talking all the remainder of their lives and make them unfailing friends of all the birds
Freckles chickens were awaiting him at the edge of the clearing
They cut the frosty air around his head into curves and circles of crimson blue and black
They chased each other from Freckles and swept so closely themselves that they brushed him with their outspread wings
At their feedingground Freckles set down his old pail of scraps and swept the snow from a small level space with a broom improvised of twigs
As soon as his back was turned the birds clustered over the food snatching scraps to carry to the nearest bushes
Several of the boldest a big crow and a couple of jays settled on the rim and feasted at leisure while a cardinal that hesitated to venture fumed and scolded from a twig overhead
Then Freckles scattered his store
At once the ground resembled the spread mantle of Montezuma except that this mass of gaily colored feathers was on the backs of living birds
While they feasted Duncan gripped his wifes arm and stared in astonishment for from the bushes and dry grass with gentle cheeping and queer throaty chatter as if to encourage each other came flocks of quail
Before anyone saw it arrive a big gray rabbit sat in the midst of the feast contentedly gnawing a cabbageleaf
Weel I be drawed on
came Mrs Duncans tense whisper
Shushu cautioned Duncan
Lastly Freckles removed his cap
He began filling it with handfuls of wheat from his pockets
In a swarm the graineaters arose around him as a flock of tame pigeons
They perched on his arms and the cap and in the stress of hunger forgetting all caution a brilliant cock cardinal and an equally gaudy jay fought for a perchingplace on his head
Weel Im beat muttered Duncan forgetting the silence imposed on his wife
Ill hae to give in
Seein is believin
A man wad hae to see that to believe it
We mauna let the Boss miss that sight for its a chance will no likely come twice in a life
Everything is snowed under and thae craturs near starved but trustin Freckles that complete they are tamer than our chickens
Look hard bairns
he whispered
Ye winna see the like o yon again while God lets ye live
Notice their color against the ice and snow and the pretty skippin ways of them
And spunky
Weel Im heat fair
Freckles emptied his cap turned his pockets and scattered his last grain
Then he waved his watching friends goodbye and started down the timberline
A week later Duncan and Freckles arose from breakfast to face the bitterest morning of the winter
When Freckles warmly capped and gloved stepped to the corner of the kitchen for his scrappail he found a big pan of steaming boiled wheat on the top of it
He wheeled to Mrs Duncan with a shining face
Were you fixing this warm food for me chickens or yours
he asked
Its for yours Freckles she said
I was afeared this cold weather they wadna lay good without a warm bite now and then
Duncan laughed as he stepped to the other room for his pipe but Freckles faced Mrs Duncan with a trace of every pang of starved motherhunger he ever had suffered written large on his homely splotched narrow features
Oh how I wish you were my mother
he cried
Mrs Duncan attempted an echo of her husbands laugh
Lord love the lad
she exclaimed
Why Freckles are ye no bright enough to learn without being taught by a woman that I am your mither
If a great man like yoursel dinna ken that learn it now and neer forget it
Ance a woman is the wife of any man she becomes wife to all men for having had the wifely experience she kens
Ance a manchild has beaten his way to life under the heart of a woman she is mither to all men for the hearts of mithers are everywhere the same
Bless ye laddie I am your mither
She tucked the coarse scarf she had knit for him closer over his chest and pulled his cap lower over his ears but Freckles whipping it off and holding it under his arm caught her rough reddened hand and pressed it to his lips in a long kiss
Then he hurried away to hide the happy embarrassing tears that were coming straight from his swelling heart
Mrs Duncan sobbing unrestrainedly swept into the adjoining room and threw herself into Duncans arms
Oh the puir lad
she wailed
Oh the puir mitherhungry lad
He breaks my heart
Duncans arms closed convulsively around his wife
With a big brown hand he lovingly stroked her rough sorrel hair
Sarah youre a guid woman
he said
Youre a michty guid woman
Ye hae a way o speakin out at times thats like the inspired prophets of the Lord
If that had been put to me now Id a felt all I kent how to and been keen enough to say the richt thing but dang it Id a stuttered and stammered and got naething out that would ha done onybody a mite o good
But ye Sarah
Did ye see his face woman
Ye sent him off lookin leke a white light of holiness had passed ower and settled on him
Ye sent the lad away too happy for mortal words Sarah
And ye made me that proud o ye
I wouldna trade ye an my share o the Limberlost with ony king ye could mention
He relaxed his clasp and setting a heavy hand on each shoulder he looked straight into her eyes
Yere prime Sarah
Juist prime
he said
Sarah Duncan stood alone in the middle of her tworoomed log cabin and lifted a bony clawlike pair of hands reddened by frequent immersion in hot water cracked and chafed by exposure to cold blacklined by constant battle with swamploam calloused with burns and stared at them wonderingly
Prettylookin things ye are
she whispered
But ye hae juist been kissed
And by such a man
Fine as God ever made at His verra best
Duncan wouldna trade wi a king
Na
Nor I wadna trade with a queen wi a palace an velvet gowns an diamonds big as hazelnuts an a hundred visitors a day into the bargain
Yeve been that honored Im blest if I can bear to souse ye in dishwater
Still that kiss winna come off
Naething can take it from me for its mine till I dee
Lord if I amna proud
Kisses on these old claws
Weel I be drawed on
CHAPTER III Wherein a Feather Falls and a Soul Is Born So Freckles fared through the bitter winter
He was very happy
He had hungered for freedom love and appreciation so long
He had been unspeakably lonely at the Home and the utter loneliness of a great desert or forest is not so difficult to endure as the loneliness of being constantly surrounded by crowds of people who do not care in the least whether one is living or dead
All through the winter Freckles entire energy was given to keeping up his lines and his chickens from freezing or starving
When the first breath of spring touched the Limberlost and the snow receded before it when the catkins began to bloom when there came a hint of green to the trees bushes and swale when the rushes lifted their heads and the pulse of the newly resurrected season beat strongly in the heart of nature something new stirred in the breast of the boy
Nature always levies her tribute
Now she laid a powerful hand on the soul of Freckles to which the boys whole being responded though he had not the least idea what was troubling him
Duncan accepted his wifes theory that it was a touch of spring fever but Freckles knew better
He never had been so well
Clean hot and steady the blood pulsed in his veins
He was always hungry and his most difficult work tired him not at all
For long months without a single intermission he had tramped those seven miles of trail twice each day through every conceivable state of weather
With the heavy club he gave his wires a sure test and between sections first in play afterward to keep his circulation going he had acquired the skill of an expert drum major
In his work there was exercise for every muscle of his body each hour of the day at night a bath wholesome food and sound sleep in a room that never knew fire
He had gained flesh and color and developed a greater strength and endurance than anyone ever could have guessed
Nor did the Limberlost contain last years terrors
He had been with her in her hour of desolation when stripped bare and deserted she had stood shivering as if herself afraid
He had made excursions into the interior until he was familiar with every path and road that ever had been cut
He had sounded the depths of her deepest pools and had learned why the trees grew so magnificently
He had found that places of swamp and swale were few compared with miles of solid timberland concealed by summers luxuriant undergrowth
The sounds that at first had struck cold fear into his soul he now knew had left on wing and silent foot at the approach of winter
As flock after flock of the birds returned and he recognized the old echoes reawakening he found to his surprise that he had been lonely for them and was hailing their return with great joy
All his fears were forgotten
Instead he was possessed of an overpowering desire to know what they were to learn where they had been and whether they would make friends with him as the winter birds had done and if they did would they be as fickle
For with the running sap creeping worm and winging bug most of Freckles chickens had deserted him entered the swamp and feasted to such a state of plethora on its store that they cared little for his supply so that in the strenuous days of mating and nestbuilding the boy was deserted
He chafed at the birds ingratitude but he found speedy consolation in watching and befriending the newcomers
He surely would have been proud and highly pleased if he had known that many of the former inhabitants of the interior swamp now grouped their nests beside the timberline solely for the sake of his protection and company
The yearly resurrection of the Limberlost is a mighty revival
Freckles stood back and watched with awe and envy the gradual reclothing and repopulation of the swamp
Keeneyed and alert through danger and loneliness he noted every stage of development from the first piping frog and unsheathing bud to full leafage and the return of the last migrant
The knowledge of his complete loneliness and utter insignificance was hourly thrust upon him
He brooded and fretted until he was in a fever yet he never guessed the cause
He was filled with a vast impatience a longing that he scarcely could endure
It was June by the zodiac June by the Limberlost and by every delight of a newly resurrected season it should have been June in the hearts of all men
Yet Freckles scowled darkly as he came down the trail and the running TAP TAP that tested the sagging wire and telegraphed word of his coming to his furred and feathered friends of the swamp this morning carried the story of his discontent a mile ahead of him
Freckles special pet a dainty yellowcoated blacksleeved cock goldfinch had remained on the wire for several days past the bravest of all and Freckles absorbed with the cunning and beauty of the tiny fellow never guessed that he was being duped
For the goldfinch was skipping flirting and swinging for the express purpose of so holding his attention that he would not look up and see a small cradle of thistledown and wool perilously near his head
In the beginning of brooding the spunky little homesteader had clung heroically to the wire when he was almost paralyzed with fright
When day after day passed and brought only softly whistled repetitions of his call a handful of crumbs on the top of a locust linepost and gently worded coaxings he grew in confidence
Of late he had sung and swung during the passing of Freckles who not dreaming of the nest and the solemneyed little hen so close above thought himself unusually gifted in his power to attract the birds
This morning the goldfinch scarcely could believe his ears and clung to the wire until an unusually vicious rap sent him spinning a foot in air and his PTSEET came with a squall of utter panic
The wires were ringing with a story the birds could not translate and Freckles was quite as ignorant of the trouble as they
A peculiar movement beneath a small walnut tree caught his attention
He stopped to investigate
There was an unusually large Luna cocoon and the moth was bursting the upper end in its struggles to reach light and air
Freckles stood and stared
Theres something in there trying to get out he muttered
Wonder if I could help it
Guess I best not be trying
If I hadnt happened along there wouldnt have been anyone to do anything and maybe Id only be hurting it
ItsitsOh skaggany
Its just being born
Freckles gasped with surprise
The moth cleared the opening and with many wabblings and contortions climbed up the tree
He stared speechless with amazement as the moth crept around a limb and clung to the under side
There was a big pursy body almost as large as his thumb and of the very snowiest white that Freckles ever had seen
There was a band of delicate lavender across its forehead and its feet were of the same colour there were antlers like tiny strawcolored ferns on its head and from its shoulders hung the crumpled wet wings
As Freckles gazed tense with astonishment he saw that these were expanding drooping taking on color and small oval markings were beginning to show
The minutes passed
Freckles steady gaze never wavered
Without realizing it he was trembling with eagerness and anxiety
As he saw what was taking place Its going to fly he breathed in hushed wonder
The morning sun fell on the moth and dried its velvet down while the warm air made it fluffy
The rapidly growing wings began to show the most delicate green with lavender foreribs transparent eyeshaped markings edged with lines of red tan and black and long crisp trailers
Freckles was whispering to himself for fear of disturbing the moth
It began a systematic exercise of raising and lowering its exquisite wings to dry them and to establish circulation
The boy realized that soon it would be able to spread them and sail away
His longcoming soul sent up its first shivering cry
I dont know what it is
Oh I wish I knew
How I wish I knew
It must be something grand
It cant be a butterfly
Its away too big
Oh I wish there was someone to tell me what it is
He climbed on the locust post and balancing himself with the wire held a finger in the line of the moths advance up the twig
It unhesitatingly climbed on so he stepped to the path holding it to the light and examining it closely
Then he held it in the shade and turned it gloating over its markings and beautiful coloring
When he held the moth to the limb it climbed on still waving those magnificent wings
My but Id like to be staying with you
he said
But if I was to stand here all day you couldnt grow any prettier than you are right now and I wouldnt grow smart enough to tell what you are
I suppose theres someone who knows
Of course there is
Mr McLean said there were people who knew every leaf bird and flower in the Limberlost
Oh Lord
How I wish Youd be telling me just this one thing
The goldfinch had ventured back to the wire for there was his mate only a few inches above the mancreatures head and indeed he simply must not be allowed to look up so the brave little fellow rocked on the wire and piped as he had done every day for a week SEE ME
SEE ME
See you
Of course I see you growled Freckles
I see you day after day and what good is it doing me
I might see you every morning for a year and then not be able to be telling anyone about it
Seen a bird with black silk wingslittle and yellow as any canary
Thats as far as Id get
What you doing here anyway
Have you a mate
Whats your name
See you
I reckon I see you but I might as well be blind for any good its doing me
Freckles impatiently struck the wire
With a screech of fear the goldfinch fled precipitately
His mate arose from the nest with a whirrFreckles looked up and saw it
Oho
he cried
So THATS what you are doing here
You have a wife
And so close my head I have been mighty near wearing a bird on my bonnet and never knew it
Freckles laughed at his own jest while in better humor he climbed to examine the neat tiny cradle and its contents
The hen darted at him in a frenzy
Now where do you come in
he demanded when he saw that she was not similar to the goldfinch
You be clearing out of here
This is none of your fry
This is the nest of me little yellow friend of the wire and you shant be touching it
Dont blame you for wanting to see though
My but its a fine nest and beauties of eggs
Will you be keeping away or will I fire this stick at you
Freckles dropped to the trail
The hen darted to the nest and settled on it with a tender coddling movement
He of the yellow coat flew to the edge to make sure that everything was right
It would have been plain to the veriest novice that they were partners in that cradle
Well Ill be switched
muttered Freckles
If that aint both their nest
And hes yellow and shes green or shes yellow and hes green
Of course I dont know and I havent any way to find out but its plain as the nose on your face that they are both ready to be fighting for that nest so of course they belong
Doesnt that beat you
Say thats whats been sticking me all of this week on that grass nest in the thorn tree down the line
One day a blue bird is setting so I think it is hers
The next day a brown bird is on and I chase it off because the nest is blues
Next day the brown bird is on again and I let her be because I think it must be hers
Next day be golly blues on and off I send her because its browns and now I bet my hat its both their nest and Ive only been bothering them and making a big fool of mesilf
Pretty specimen I am pretending to be a friend to the birds and so blamed ignorant I dont know which ones go in pairs and blue and brown are a pair of course if yellow and green areand theres the red birds
I never thought of them
Hes red and shes grayand now I want to be knowing are they all different
Why no
Of course they aint
Theres the jays all blue and the crows all black
The tide of Freckles discontent welled until he almost choked with anger and chagrin
He plodded down the trail scowling blackly and viciously spanging the wire
At the finches nest he left the line and peered into the thorn tree
There was no bird brooding
He pressed closer to take a peep at the snowy spotless little eggs he had found so beautiful when at the slight noise up raised four tiny baby heads with wideopen mouths uttering hunger cries
Freckles stepped back
The brown bird alighted on the edge and closed one cavity with a wiggling green worm while not two minutes later the blue filled another with a white
That settled it
The blue and brown were mates
Once again Freckles repeated his How I wish I knew
Around the bridge spanning Sleepy Snake Creek the swale spread widely the timber was scattering and willows rushes marsh grass and splendid wild flowers grew abundantly
Here lazy big black water snakes for which the creek was named sunned on the bushes wild ducks and grebe chattered cranes and herons fished and muskrats plowed the bank in queer rolling furrows
It was always a place full of interest so Freckles loved to linger on the bridge watching the marsh and water people
He also transacted affairs of importance with the wild flowers and sweet marshgrass
He enjoyed splashing through the shallow pools on either side of the bridge
Then too where the creek entered the swamp was a place of unusual beauty
The water spread in darksome mossy green pools
Waterplants and lilies grew luxuriantly throwing up large rank green leaves
Nowhere else in the Limberlost could be found frogmusic to equal that of the mouth of the creek
The drumming and piping rolled in neverending orchestral effect while the full chorus rang to its accompaniment throughout the season
Freckles slowly followed the path leading from the bridge to the line
It was the one spot at which he might relax his vigilance
The boldest timber thief the swamp ever had known would not have attempted to enter it by the mouth of the creek on account of the water and because there was no protection from surrounding trees
He was bending the rank grass with his cudgel and thinking of the shade the denser swamp afforded when he suddenly dodged sidewise the cudgel whistled sharply through the air and Freckles sprang back
From the clear sky above him first level with his face then skimming dipping tilting whirling until it struck quill down in the path in front of him came a glossy iridescent big black feather
As it touched the ground Freckles snatched it up with almost a continuous movement facing the sky
There was not a tree of any size in a large open space
There was no wind to carry it
From the clear sky it had fallen and Freckles gazing eagerly into the arch of June blue with a few lazy clouds floating high in the sea of ether had neither mind nor knowledge to dream of a bird hanging as if frozen there
He turned the big quill questioningly and again his awed eyes swept the sky
A feather dropped from Heaven
he breathed reverently
Are the holy angels moulting
But no if they were it would be white
Maybe all the angels are not for being white
What if the angels of God are white and those of the devil are black
But a black one has no business up there
Maybe some poor black angel is so tired of being punished its for slipping to the gates beating its wings trying to make the Master hear
Again and again Freckles searched the sky but there was no answering gleam of golden gates no form of sailing bird then he went slowly on his way turning the feather and wondering about it
It was a wing quill eighteen inches in length with a heavy spine gray at the base shading to jet black at the tip and it caught the play of the suns rays in slanting gleams of green and bronze
Again Freckles old man of the sea sat sullen and heavy on his shoulders and weighted him down until his step lagged and his heart ached
Where did it come from
What is it
Oh how I wish I knew
he kept repeating as he turned and studied the feather with almost unseeing eyes so intently was he thinking
Before him spread a large green pool filled with rotting logs and leaves bordered with delicate ferns and grasses among which lifted the creamy spikes of the arrowhead the blue of waterhyacinth and the delicate yellow of the jewelflower
As Freckles leaned handling the feather and staring at it then into the depths of the pool he once more gave voice to his old query I wonder what it is
Straight across from him couched in the mosses of a soggy old log a big green bullfrog with palpitant throat and batting eyes lifted his head and bellowed in answer
FIN DOUT
FIN DOUT
Whawhats that
stammered Freckles almost too much bewildered to speak
II know you are only a bullfrog but be jabbers that sounded mightily like speech
Wouldnt you please to be saying it over
The bullfrog cuddled contentedly in the ooze
Then suddenly he lifted his voice and as an imperative drumbeat rolled it again FIN DOUT
FIN DOUT
FIN DOUT
Freckles had the answer
Something seemed to snap in his brain
There was a wavering flame before his eyes
Then his mind cleared
His head lifted in a new poise his shoulders squared while his spine straightened
The agony was over
His soul floated free
Freckles came into his birthright
Before God I will
He uttered the oath so impressively that the recording angel never winced as he posted it in the prayer column
Freckles set his hat over the top of one of the locust posts used between trees to hold up the wire while he fastened the feather securely in the band
Then he started down the line talking to himself as men who have worked long alone always fall into the habit of doing
What a fool I have been
he muttered
Of course thats what I have to do
There wouldnt likely anybody be doing it for me
Of course I can
What am I a man for
If I was a fourfooted thing of the swamp maybe I couldnt but a man can do anything if hes the grit to work hard enough and stick at it Mr McLean is always saying and heres the way I am to do it
He said too that there were people that knew everything in the swamp
Of course they have written books
The thing for me to be doing is to quit moping and be buying some
Never bought a book in me life or anything else of much account for that matter
Oh aint I glad I didnt waste me money
Ill surely be having enough to get a few
Let me see
Freckles sat on a log took his pencil and accountbook and figured on a back page
He had walked the timberline ten months
His pay was thirty dollars a month and his board cost him eight
That left twentytwo dollars a month and his clothing had cost him very little
At the least he had two hundred dollars in the bank
He drew a deep breath and smiled at the sky with satisfaction
Ill be having a book about all the birds trees flowers butterflies andYes by gummy
Ill be having one about the frogsif it takes every cent I have he promised himself
He put away the accountbook that was his most cherished possession caught up his stick and started down the line
The even tap tap and the cheery gladsome whistle carried far ahead of him the message that Freckles was himself again
He fell into a rapid pace for he had lost time that morning when he rounded the last curve he was almost running
There was a chance that the Boss might be there for his weekly report
Then wavering flickering darting here and there over the sweet marshgrass came a large black shadow sweeping so closely before him that for the second time that morning Freckles dodged and sprang back
He had seen some owls and hawks of the swamp that he thought might be classed as large birds but never anything like this for six feet it spread its big shining wings
Its strong feet could be seen drawn among its feathers
The sun glinted on its sharp hooked beak
Its eyes glowed caught the light and seemed able to pierce the ground at his feet
It cared no more for Freckles than if he had not been there for it perched on a low tree while a second later it awkwardly hopped to the trunk of a lightningriven elm turned its back and began searching the blue
Freckles looked just in time to see a second shadow sweep the grass and another bird a trifle smaller and not quite so brilliant in the light slowly sailed down to perch beside the first
Evidently they were mates for with a queer rolling hop the firstcomer shivered his bronze wings sidled to the new arrival and gave her a silly little peck on her wing
Then he coquettishly drew away and ogled her
He lifted his head waddled from her a few steps awkwardly ambled back and gave her such a simple sort of kiss on her beak that Freckles burst into a laugh but clapped his hand over his mouth to stifle the sound
The lover ducked and sidestepped a few feet
He spread his wings and slowly and softly waved them precisely as if he were fanning his charmer which was indeed the result he accomplished
Then a wave of uncontrollable tenderness moved him so he hobbled to his bombardment once more
He faced her squarely this time and turned his head from side to side with queer little jerks and indiscriminate peckings at her wings and head and smirkings that really should have been irresistible
She yawned and shuffled away indifferently
Freckles reached up pulled the quill from his hat and looking from it to the birds nodded in settled conviction
So youre me black angels ye spalpeens
No wonder you didnt get in
But Ill back you to come closer it than any other birds ever did
You fly higher than I can see
Have you picked the Limberlost for a good thing and come to try it
Well you can be me chickens if you want to but Im blest if you aint cool for new ones
Why dont you take this stick for a gun and go skinning a mile
Freckles broke into an unrestrained laugh for the birdlover was keen about his courting while evidently his mate was diffident
When he approached too boisterously she relieved him of a goodly tuft of feathers and sent him backward in a series of squirmy little jumps that gave the boy an idea of what had happened upsky to send the falling feather across his pathway
Score one for the lady
Ill be umpiring this volunteered Freckles
With a ravishing swagger halflifted wings and deep guttural hissing the lover approached again
He suddenly lifted his body but she coolly rocked forward on the limb glided gracefully beneath him and slowly sailed into the Limberlost
He recovered himself and gazed after her in astonishment
Freckles hurried down the trail shaking with laughter
When he neared the path to the clearing and saw the Boss sitting motionless on the mare that was the pride of his heart the boy broke into a run
Oh Mr
McLean
he cried
I hope I havent kept you waiting very long
And the sun is getting hot
I have been so slow this morning
I could have gone faster only there were that many things to keep me and I didnt know you would be here
Ill hurry after this
Ive never had to be giving excuses before
The line wasnt down and there wasnt a sign of trouble it was other things that were making me late
McLean smiling on the boy immediately noticed the difference in him
This flushed panting talkative lad was not the same creature who had sought him in despair and bitterness
He watched in wonder as Freckles mopped the perspiration from his forehead and began to laugh
Then forgetting all his customary reserve with the Boss the pentup boyishness in the lad broke forth
With an eloquence of which he never dreamed he told his story
He talked with such enthusiasm that McLean never took his eyes from his face or shifted in the saddle until he described the strange birdlover and then the Boss suddenly bent over the pommel and laughed with the boy
Freckles decorated his story with keen appreciation and rare touches of Irish wit and drollery that made it most interesting as well as very funny
It was a first attempt at descriptive narration
With an inborn gift for striking the vital point a naturalists dawning enthusiasm for the wonders of the Limberlost and the welling joy of his newly found happiness he made McLean see the struggles of the moth and its freshly painted wings the dainty brilliant birdmates of different colors the feather sliding through the clear air the palpitant throat and batting eyes of the frog while his version of the big birds courtship won for the Boss the best laugh he had enjoyed for years
Theyre in the middle of a swamp now said Freckles
Do you suppose there is any chance of them staying with me chickens
If they do theyll be about the queerest I have but I tell you sir I am finding some plum good ones
Theres a new kind over at the mouth of the creek that uses its wings like feet and walks on all fours
It travels like a thrashing machine
Theres another tall as me waist with a bill a foot long a neck near two not the thickness of me wrist and an elegant color
Hes some blue and gray touched up with black white and brown
The voice of him is such that if hed be going up and standing beside a tree and crying at it a few times he could be sawing it square off
I dont know but it would be a good idea to try him on the gang sir
McLean laughed
Those must be blue herons Freckles he said
And it doesnt seem possible but your description of the big black birds sounds like genuine black vultures
They are common enough in the South
Ive seen them numerous around the lumber camps of Georgia but I never before heard of any this far north
They must be strays
You have described perfectly our nearest equivalent to a branch of these birds called in Europe Pharaohs Chickens but if they are coming to the Limberlost they will have to drop Pharaoh and become Freckles Chickens like the remainder of the birds wont they
Or are they too odd and ugly to interest you
Oh not at all at all
cried Freckles bursting into pure brogue in his haste
I dont know as Id be calling them exactly pretty and they do move like a rockinghorse loping but they are so big and fearless
They have a fine color for black birds and their feet and beaks seem so strong
You never saw anything so keen as their eyes
And fly
Why just think sir they must be flying miles straight up for they were out of sight completely when the feather fell
I dont suppose Ive a chicken in the swamp that can go as close heaven as those big black fellows and then Freckles voice dragged and he hesitated
Then what
interestedly urged McLean
He was loving her so answered Freckles in a hushed voice
I know it looked awful funny and I laughed and told on him but if Id taken time to think I dont believe Id have done it
You see Ive seen such a little bit of loving in me life
You easily can be understanding that at the Home it was every day the old story of neglect and desertion
Always people that didnt even care enough for their children to keep them so you see sir I had to like him for trying so hard to make her know how he loved her
Of course theyre only birds but if they are caring for each other like that why its just the same as people aint it
Freckles lifted his brave steady eyes to the Boss
If anybody loved me like that Mr McLean I wouldnt be spending any time on how they looked or moved
All Id be thinking of would be how they felt toward me
If they will stay Ill be caring as much for them as any chickens I have
If I did laugh at them I thought he was just fine
The face of McLean was a study but the honest eyes of the boy were so compelling that he found himself answering You are right Freckles
Hes a gentleman isnt he
And the only real chicken you have
Of course hell remain
The Limberlost will be paradise for his family
And now Freckles what has been the trouble all spring
You have done your work as faithfully as anyone could ask but I cant help seeing that there is something wrong
Are you tired of your job
I love it answered Freckles
It will almost break me heart when the gang comes and begins tearing up the swamp and scaring away me chickens
Then what is the trouble
insisted McLean
I think sir its been books answered Freckles
You see I didnt realize it meself until the bullfrog told me this morning
I hadnt ever even heard about a place like this
Anyway I wasnt understanding how it would be if I had
Being among these beautiful things every day I got so anxious like to be knowing and naming them that it got to eating into me and went and made me near sick when I was well as I could be
Of course I learned to read write and figure some at school but there was nothing there or in any of the city that I ever got to see that would make a fellow even be dreaming of such interesting things as there are here
Ive seen the parksbut good Lord they aint even beginning to be in it with the Limberlost
Its all new and strange to me
I dont know a thing about any of it
The bullfrog told me to find out plain as day and books are the only way aint they
Of course said McLean astonished at himself for his heartfelt relief
He had not guessed until that minute what it would have meant to him to have Freckles give up
You know enough to study out what you want yourself if you have the books dont you
I am pretty sure I do said Freckles
I learned all Id the chance at in the Home and me schooling was good as far as it went
Wouldnt let you go past fourteen you know
I always did me sums perfect and loved me history books
I had them almost by heart
I never could get me grammar to suit them
They said it was just born in me to go wrong talking and if it hadnt been I suppose I would have picked it up from the other children but Id the best voice of any of them in the Home or at school
I could knock them all out singing
I was always leader in the Home and once one of the superintendents gave me carfare and let me go into the city and sing in a boys choir
The master said Id the swatest voice of them all until it got rough like and then he made me quit for awhile but he said it would be coming back by now and Im railly thinking it is sir for Ive tried on the line a bit of late and it seems to go smooth again and lots stronger
That and me chickens have been all the company Ive been having and it will be all Ill want if I can have some books and learn the real names of things where they come from and why they do such interesting things
Its been fretting me more than I knew to be shut up here among all these wonders and not knowing a thing
I wanted to ask you what some books would cost me and if youd be having the goodness to get me the right ones
I think I have enough money Freckles offered his accountbook and the Boss studied it gravely
You neednt touch your account Freckles he said
Ten dollars from this months pay will provide you everything you need to start on
I will write a friend in Grand Rapids today to select you the very best and send them at once
Freckles eyes were shining
Never owned a book in me life
he said
Even me schoolbooks were never mine
Lord
How I used to wish I could have just one of them for me very own
Wont it be fun to see me sawbird and me little yellow fellow looking at me from the pages of a book and their real names and all about them printed alongside
How long will it be taking sir
Ten days should do it nicely said McLean
Then seeing Freckles lengthening face he added Ill have Duncan bring you a tenbushel storebox the next time he goes to town
He can haul it to the west entrance and set it up wherever you want it
You can put in your spare time filling it with the specimens you find until the books come and then you can study out what you have
I suspect you could collect specimens that I could send to naturalists in the city and sell for you things like that winged creature this morning
I dont know much in that line but it must have been a moth and it might have been rare
Ive seen them by the thousand in museums and in all nature I dont remember rarer coloring than their wings
Ill order you a butterflynet and box and show you how scientists pin specimens
Possibly you can make a fine collection of these swamp beauties
It will be all right for you to take a pair of different moths and butterflies but I dont want to hear of your killing any birds
They are protected by heavy fines
McLean rode away leaving Freckles staring aghast
Then he saw the point and smiled
Standing on the trail he twirled the feather and thought over the morning
Well if life aint getting to be worth living
he said wonderingly
Biggest streak of luck I ever had
Bout time something was coming my way but I wouldnt ever thought anybody could strike such magnificent prospects through only a falling feather
CHAPTER IV Wherein Freckles Faces Trouble Bravely and Opens the Way for New Experiences On Duncans return from his next trip to town there was a big storebox loaded on the back of his wagon
He drove to the west entrance of the swamp set the box on a stump that Freckles had selected in a beautiful sheltered place and made it secure on its foundations with a tree at its back
It seems most a pity to nail into that tree said Duncan
I haena the time to examine into the grain of it but it looks as if it might be a rare ane
Anyhow the nailin winna hurt it deep and havin the case by it will make it safer if it is a guid ane
Isnt it an oak
asked Freckles
Ay said Duncan
It looks like it might be ane of thae finegrained white anes that mak such grand furniture
When the body of the case was secure Duncan made a door from the lid and fastened it with hinges
He drove a staple screwed on a latch and gave Freckles a small padlockso that he might fasten in his treasures safely
He made a shelf at the top for his books and last of all covered the case with oilcloth
It was the first time in Freckles life that anyone ever had done that much for his pleasure and it warmed his heart with pure joy
If the interior of the box already had been covered with the rarest treasures of the Limberlost he could have been no happier
When the big teamster stood back to look at his work he laughingly quoted Neat but no gaudy as McLean says
All were needing now is a coat of paint to make a cupboard that would turn Sarah green with envy
Yell find that safe an dry lad an thats all thats needed
Mr Duncan said Freckles I dont know why you are being so mighty good to me but if you have any jobs at the cabin that I could do for you or Mrs Duncan hours off the line it would make me mighty happy
Duncan laughed
Ye needna feel ye are obliged to me lad
Ye mauna think I could take a halfday off in the best hauling season and go to town for boxes to rig up and spend of my little for fixtures
I knew Mr McLean sent you said Freckles his eyes wide and bright with happiness
Its so good of him
How I wish I could do something that would please him as much
Why Freckles said Duncan as he knelt and began collecting his tools I canna see that it will hurt ye to be told that ye are doing every day a thing that pleases the Boss as much as anything ye could do
Yere being uncommon faithful lad and honest as old Father Time
McLean is trusting ye as he would his own flesh and blood
Oh Duncan
cried the happy boy
Are you sure
Why I know answered Duncan
I wadna venture to say so else
In those first days he cautioned me na to tell ye but now he wadna care
Dye ken Freckles that some of the single trees ye are guarding are worth a thousand dollars
Freckles caught his breath and stood speechless
Ye see said Duncan thats why they maun be watched so closely
They tak say for instance a burl maplebirds eye they call it in the factory because its full o wee knots and twists that look like the eve of a bird
They saw it out in sheets no muckle thicker than writin paper
Then they make up the funiture out of cheaper wood and cover it with the mapleveneer they call it
When its all done and polished ye never saw onythin grander
Gang into a retail shop the next time ye are in town and see some
By sawin it thin that way they get finish for thousands of dollars worth of furniture from a single tree
If ye dinna watch faithful and Black Jack gets out a few he has marked it means the loss of more money than ye ever dreamed of lad
The other night down at camp some son of Balaam was suggestin that ye might be sellin the Boss out to Jack and lettin him tak the trees secretly and nobody wad ever ken till the gang gets here
A wave of scarlet flooded Freckles face and he blazed hotly at the insult
And the Boss continued Duncan coolly ignoring Freckles anger he lays back just as cool as cowcumbers an says Ill give a thousand dollars to ony man that will show me a fresh stump when we reach the Limberlost says he
Some of the men just snapped him op that theyd find some
So you see bow the Boss is trustin ye lad
I am gladder than I can ever expriss said Freckles
And now will I be walking double time to keep some of them from cutting a tree to get all that money
Mither o Moses
howled Duncan
Ye can trust the Scotch to bungle things athegither
McLean was only meanin to show ye all confidence and honor
Hes gone and set a high price for some dirty whelp to ruin ye
I was just tryin to show ye how he felt toward ye and Ive gone an give ye that worry to bear
Damn the Scotch
Theyre so slow an so dumb
Exciptin prisint company
sweetly inquired Freckles
No
growled Duncan
Headin the list
Hed nae business to set a price on ye lad for thats about the amount of it an Id nae right to tell ye
Weve both done ye ill an both meanin the verra best
Juist what Im always sayin to Sarah
I am mighty proud of what you have been telling me Duncan said Freckles
I need the warning sure
For with the books coming I might be timpted to neglect me work when double watching is needed
Thank you more than I can say for putting me on to it
What youve told me may be the saving of me
I wont stop for dinner now
Ill be getting along the east line and when I come around about three maybe Mother Duncan will let me have a glass of milk and a bite of something
Ye see now
cried Duncan in disgust
Yell start on that sevenmile tramp with na bite to stay your stomach
What was it I told ye
You told me that the Scotch had the hardest heads and the softest hearts of any people thats living answered Freckles
Duncan grunted in gratified disapproval
Freckles picked up his club and started down the line whistling cheerily for he had an unusually long repertoire upon which to draw
Duncan went straight to the lower camp and calling McLean aside repeated the conversation verbatim ending And nae matter what happens now or ever dinna ye dare let onythin make ye believe that Freckles hasna guarded faithful as ony man could
I dont think anything could shake my faith in the lad answered McLean
Freckles was whistling merrily
He kept one eye religiously on the line
The other he divided between the path his friends of the wire and a search of the sky for his latest arrivals
Every day since their coming he had seen them either hanging as small black clouds above the swamp or bobbing over logs and trees with their queer tilting walk
Whenever he could spare time he entered the swamp and tried to make friends with them for they were the tamest of all his unnumbered subjects
They ducked dodged and ambled around him over logs and bushes and not even a near approach would drive them to flight
For two weeks he had found them circling over the Limberlost regularly but one morning the female was missing and only the big black chicken hung sentinel above the swamp
His mate did not reappear in the following days and Freckles grew very anxious
He spoke of it to Mrs Duncan and she quieted his fears by raising a delightful hope in their stead
Why Freckles if its the henbird ye are missing its ten to one shes safe she said
Shes laid and is setting ye silly
Watch him and mark whaur he lichts
Then follow and find the nest
Some Sabbath well all gang see it
Accepting this theory Freckles began searching for the nest
Because these chickens were large as the hawks he looked among the treetops until he almost sprained the back of his neck
He had half the crow and hawk nests in the swamp located
He searched for this nest instead of collecting subjects for his case
He found the pair the middle of one forenoon on the elm where he had watched their lovemaking
The big black chicken was feeding his mate so it was proved that they were a pair they were both alive and undoubtedly she was brooding
After that Freckles nesthunting continued with renewed zeal but as he had no idea where to look and Duncan could offer no helpful suggestion the nest was no nearer to being found
Coming from a long day on the trail Freckles saw Duncans children awaiting him much closer the swale than they usually ventured and from their wild gestures he knew that something had happened
He began to run but the cry that reached him was The books have come
How they hurried
Freckles lifted the youngest to his shoulder the second took his club and dinner pail and when they reached Mrs Duncan they found her at work on a big box
She had loosened the lid and then she laughingly sat on it
Ye canna have a peep in here until ye have washed and eaten supper she said
Its all ready on the table
Ance ye begin on this yell no be willin to tak your nose o it till bedtime and I willna get my work done the nicht
Weve eaten long ago
It was difficult work but Freckles smiled bravely
He made himself neat swallowed a few bites then came so eagerly that Mrs Duncan yielded although she said she very well knew all the time that his supper would be spoiled
Lifting the lid they removed the packing and found in that box books on birds trees flowers moths and butterflies
There was also one containing Freckles bullfrog true to life
Besides these were a butterflynet a naturalists tin specimenbox a bottle of cyanide a box of cotton a paper of long steel specimenpins and a letter telling what all these things were and how to use them
At the discovery of each new treasure Freckles shouted Will you be looking at this now
Mrs Duncan cried Weel I be drawed on
The eldest boy turned a somersault for every extra while the baby trying to follow his example bunched over in a sidewise sprawl and cut his foot on the axe with which his mother had prized up the boxlid
That sobered them they carried the books indoors
Mrs Duncan had a top shelf in her closet cleared for them far above the reach of meddling little fingers
When Freckles started for the trail next morning the shining new specimenbox flashed on his back
The black chicken a mere speck in the blue caught the gleam of it
The folded net hung beside the boys hatchet and the bird book was in the box
He walked the line and tested each section scrupulously watching every foot of the trail for he was determined not to slight his work but if ever a boy made haste slowly in a hurry it was Freckles that morning
When at last he reached the space he had cleared and planted around his case his heart swelled with the pride of possessing even so much that he could call his own while his quick eyes feasted on the beauty of it
He had made a large room with the door of the case set even with one side of it
On three sides fine big bushes of wild rose climbed to the lower branches of the trees
Part of his walls were mallow part alder thorn willow and dogwood
Below there filled in a solid mass of pale pink sheeplaurel and yellow St Johns wort while the amber threads of the dodder interlaced everywhere
At one side the swamp came close here cattails grew in profusion
In front of them he had planted a row of waterhyacinths without disturbing in the least the state of their azure bloom and where the ground arose higher for his floor a row of foxfire that soon would be open
To the left he had discovered a queer natural arrangement of the trees that grew to giant size and were set in a gradually narrowing space so that a long open vista stretched away until lost in the dim recesses of the swamp
A little trimming of underbush rolling of dead logs levelling of floor and carpeting with moss made it easy to understand why Freckles had named this the cathedral yet he never had been taught that the groves were Gods first temples
On either side of the trees that constituted the first arch of this dim vista of the swamp he planted ferns that grew waisthigh thus early in the season and so skilfully the work had been done that not a frond drooped because of the change
Opposite he cleared a space and made a flower bed
He filled one end with every delicate lacy vine and fern he could transplant successfully
The body of the bed was a riot of color
Here he set growing dainty blueeyedMarys and blueeyed grass side by side
He planted harebells violets blue white and yellow wild geranium cardinalflower columbine pink snakes mouth buttercups painted trilliums and orchis
Here were bloodroot moccasinflower hepatica pitcherplant Jackinthepulpit and every other flower of the Limberlost that was in bloom or bore a bud presaging a flower
Every day saw the addition of new specimens
The place would have driven a botanist wild with envy
On the line side he left the bushes thick for concealment entering by a narrow path he and Duncan had cleared in setting up the case
He called this the front door though he used every precaution to hide it
He built rustic seats between several of the trees leveled the floor and thickly carpeted it with rank heavy woollydog moss
Around the case he planted wild clematis bittersweet and wildgrapevines and trained them over it until it was almost covered
Every day he planted new flowers cut back rough bushes and coaxed out graceful ones
His pride in his room was very great but he had no idea how surprisingly beautiful it would appear to anyone who had not witnessed its growth and construction
This morning Freckles walked straight to his case unlocked it and set his apparatus and dinner inside
He planted a new specimen he had found close the trail and bringing his old scrapbucket from the corner in which it was hidden from a nearby pool he dipped water to pour over his carpet and flowers
Then he took out the bird book settled comfortably on a bench and with a deep sigh of satisfaction turned to the section headed
V Past veery and vireo he went down the line until his finger trembling with eagerness stopped at vulture
Great black California vulture he read
Humph
This side the Rockies will do for us
Common turkeybuzzard
Well we aint hunting common turkeys
McLean said chickens and what he says goes
Black vulture of the South
Here we are arrived at once
Freckles finger followed the line and he read scraps aloud
Common in the South
Sometimes called Jim Crow
Nearest equivalent to Cathartes Atrata
How the divil am I ever to learn them corkin big words by mesel
the Pharaohs Chickens of European species
Sometimes stray north as far as Virginia and Kentucky And sometimes farther interpolated Freckles cos I got them right here in Indiana so like these pictures I can just see me big chicken bobbing up to get his ears boxed
Hey
Lightblue eggs Golly
I got to be seeing them
big as a common turkeys but shaped like a hens heavily splotched with chocolate Caramels I suppose
And in hollow logs or stumps
Oh hagginy
Wasnt I barking up the wrong tree though
Ought to been looking close the ground all this time
Now its all to do over and I suspect the sooner I start the sooner Ill be likely to find them
Freckles put away his book dampened the smudgefire without which the mosquitoes made the swamp almost unbearable took his cudgel and lunch and went to the line
He sat on a log ate at dinnertime and drank his last drop of water
The heat of June was growing intense
Even on the west of the swamp where one had full benefit of the breeze from the upland it was beginning to be unpleasant in the middle of the day
He brushed the crumbs from his knees and sat resting awhile and watching the sky to see if his big chicken were hanging up there
But he came to the earth abruptly for there were steps coming down the trail that were neither McLeans nor Duncansand there never had been others
Freckles heart leaped hotly
He ran a quick hand over his belt to feel if his revolver and hatchet were there caught up his cudgel and laid it across his kneesthen sat quietly waiting
Was it Black Jack or someone even worse
Forced to do something to brace his nerves he puckered his stiffening lips and began whistling a tune he had led in his clear tenor every year of his life at the Home Christmas exercises
Who comes this way so blithe and gay Upon a merry Christmas day
His quick Irish wit roused to the ridiculousness of it until he broke into a laugh that steadied him amazingly
Through the bushes he caught a glimpse of the oncoming figure
His heart flooded with joy for it was a man from the gang
Wessner had been his bunkmate the night he came down the corduroy
He knew him as well as any of McLeans men
This was no timberthief
No doubt the Boss had sent him with a message
Freckles sprang up and called cheerily a warm welcome on his face
Well its good telling if youre glad to see me said Wessner with something very like a breath of relief
We been hearing down at the camp you were so mighty touchy you didnt allow a man within a rod of the line
No more do I answered Freckles if hes a stranger but youre from McLean aint you
Oh damn McLean
said Wessner
Freckles gripped the cudgel until his knuckles slowly turned purple
And are you railly saying so
he inquired with elaborate politeness
Yes I am said Wessner
So would every man of the gang if they wasnt too big cowards to say anything unless maybe that other slobbering old Scotchman Duncan
Grinding the lives out of us
Working us like dogs and paying us starvation wages while he rolls up his millions and lives like a prince
Green lights began to play through the gray of Freckles eyes
Wessner he said impressively youd make a fine pattern for the father of liars
Every man on that gang is strong and hilthy paid all he earns and treated with the courtesy of a gentleman
As for the Boss living like a prince he shares fare with you every day of your lives
Wessner was not a born diplomat but he saw he was on the wrong tack so he tried another
How would you like to make a good big pile of money without even lifting your hand
he asked
Humph
said Freckles
Have you been up to Chicago and cornered wheat and are you offering me a friendly tip on the invistment of me fortune
Wessner came close
Freckles old fellow he said if you let me give you a pointer I can put you on to making a cool five hundred without stepping out of your tracks
Freckles drew back
You neednt be afraid of speaking up he said
There isnt a soul in the Limberlost save the birds and the beasts unless some of your sorts come along ands crowding the privileges of the legal tinints
None of my friends along said Wessner
Nobody knew I came but Black II mean a friend of mine
If you want to hear sense and act with reason he can see you later but it aint necessary
We can make all the plans needed
The tricks so dead small and easy
Must be if you have the engineering of it said Freckles
But he heard with a sigh of relief that they were alone
Wessner was impervious
You just bet it is
Why only think Freckles slavin away at a measly little thirty dollars a month and here is a chance to clear five hundred in a day
You surely wont be the fool to miss it
And how was you proposing for me to stale it
inquired Freckles
Or am I just to find it laying in me path beside the line
Thats it Freckles blustered the Dutchman youre just to find it
You neednt do a thing
You neednt know a thing
You name a morning when you will walk up the west side of the swamp and then turn round and walk back down the same side again and the money is yours
Couldnt anything be easier than that could it
Depinds entirely on the man said Freckles
The lilt of a lark hanging above the swale beside them was not sweeter than the sweetness of his voice
To some it would seem to come aisy as breathing and to some wringin the last drop of their hearts blood couldnt force thim
Im not the man that goes into a scheme like that with the blindfold over me eyes for you see it manes to break trust with the Boss and Ive served him faithful as I knew
Youll have to be making the thing very clear to me understanding
Its so dead easy repeated Wessner it makes me tired of the simpleness of it
You see theres a few trees in the swamp thats real gold mines
Theres three especial
Two are back in but ones square on the line
Why your pottering old Scotch fool of a Boss nailed the wire to it with his own hands
He never noticed where the bark had been peeled or saw what it was
If you will stay on this side of the trail just one day we can have it cut loaded and ready to drive out at night
Next morning you can find it report and be the busiest man in the search for us
We know where to fix it all safe and easy
Then McLean has a bet up with a couple of the gang that there cant be a raw stump found in the Limberlost
Theres plenty of witnesses to swear to it and I know three that will
Theres a cool thousand and this tree is worth all of that raw
Say its a gold mine I tell you and just five hundred of it is yours
Theres no danger on earth to you for youve got McLean that bamboozled you could sell out the whole swamp and hed never mistrust you
What do you say
Freckles soul was satisfied
Is that all
he asked
No it aint said Wessner
If you really want to brace up and be a man and go into the thing for keeps you can make five times that in a week
My friend knows a dozen others we could get out in a few days and all youd have to do would be to keep out of sight
Then you could take your money and skip some night and begin life like a gentleman somewhere else
What do you think about it
Freckles purred like a kitten
Twould be a rare joke on the Boss he said to be stalin from him the very thing hes trusted me to guard and be getting me wages all winter throwed in free
And youre making the pay awful high
Me to be getting five hundred for such a simple little thing as that
Youre trating me most royal indade
Its away beyond all Id be expecting
Sivinteen cints would be a big price for that job
It must be looked into thorough
Just you wait here until I do a minutes turn in the swamp and then Ill be eschorting you out of the clearing and giving you the answer
Freckles lifted the overhanging bushes and hurried to the case
He unslung the specimenbox and laid it inside with his hatchet and revolver
He slipped the key in his pocket and went back to Wessner
Now for the answer he said
Stand up
There was iron in his voice and he was commanding as an outraged general
Anything you want to be taking off
he questioned
Wessner looked the astonishment he felt
Why no Freckles he said
Have the goodness to be calling me Mister McLean snapped Freckles
Im after resarvin me pet name for the use of me friends
You may stand with your back to the light or be taking any advantage you want
Why what do you mean
spluttered Wessner
Im manin said Freckles tersely to lick a quartersection of hell out of you and may the Holy Vargin stay me before I leave you here carrion for your carcass would turn the stummicks of me chickens
At the camp that morning Wessners conduct had been so palpable an excuse to force a discharge that Duncan moved near McLean and whispered Think of the boy sir
McLean was so troubled that an hour later he mounted Nellie and followed Wessner to his home in Wildcat Hollow only to find that he had left there shortly before heading for the Limberlost
McLean rode at top speed
When Mrs Duncan told him that a man answering Wessners description had gone down the west side of the swamp close noon he left the mare in her charge and followed on foot
When he heard voices he entered the swamp and silently crept close just in time to hear Wessner whine But I cant fight you Freckles
I haint done nothing to you
Im away bigger than you and youve only one hand
The Boss slid off his coat and crouched among the bushes ready to spring but as Freckles voice reached him he held himself with a strong effort to learn what mettle was in the boy
Dont you be wasting of me good time in the numbering of me hands cried Freckles
The stringth of me cause will make up for the weakness of me mimbers and the size of a cowardly thief doesnt count
Youll think all the wildcats of the Limberlost are turned loose on you whin I come against you and as for me causeI slept with you Wessner the night I came down the corduroy like a dirty friendless tramp and the Boss was for taking me up washing clothing and feeding me and giving me a home full of love and tinderness and a master to look to and good wellearned money in the bank
Hes trusting me his heartful and here comes you you spotted toad of the big road and insults me as is an honest Irish gintleman by hinting that you concaive Id be willing to shut me eyes and hold fast while you rob him of the thing I was set and paid to guard and then act the sneak and liar to him and ruin and eternally blacken the soul of me
You damned rascal raved Freckles be fighting before I forget the laws of a gintlemins game and split your dirty head with me stick
Wessner backed away mumbling But I dont want to hurt you Freckles
Oh dont you
raged the boy now fairly frothing
Well you aint resembling me none for Im itching like death to git me fingers in the face of you
He danced up and as Wessner lunged in selfdefense ducked under his arm as a bantam and punched him in the pit of the stomach so that he doubled with a groan
Before Wessner could straighten himself Freckles was on him fighting like the wildest fury that ever left the beautiful island
The Dutchman dealt thundering blows that sometimes landed and sent Freckles reeling and sometimes missed while he went plunging into the swale with the impetus of them
Freckles could not strike with half Wessners force but he could land three blows to the Dutchmans one
It was here that the boys days of alert watching on the line the perpetual swinging of the heavy cudgel and the endurance of all weather stood him in good stead for he was tough and agile
He skipped ducked and dodged
For the first five minutes he endured fearful punishment
Then Wessners breath commenced to whistle between his teeth when Freckles only had begun fighting
He sprang back with shrill laughter
Begolly
and will your honor be whistling the hornpipe for me to be dancing of
he cried
SPANG
went his fist into Wessners face and he was past him into the swale
And would you be pleased to tune up a little livelier
he gasped and clipped his ear as he sprang back
Wessner lunged at him in blind fury
Freckles seeing an opening forgot the laws of a gentlemans game and drove the toe of his heavy wadingboot in Wessners middle until he doubled and fell heavily
In a flash Freckles was on him
For a time McLean could not see what was happening
Go
Go to him now
he commanded himself but so intense was his desire to see the boy win alone that he did not stir
At last Freckles sprang up and backed away
Time
he yelled as a fury
Be getting up Mr Wessner and dont be afraid of hurting me
Ill let you throw in an extra hand and lick you to me complate satisfaction all the same
Did you hear me call the limit
Will you get up and be facing me
As Wessner struggled to his feet he resembled a battlefield for his clothing was in ribbons and his face and hands streaming blood
II guess I got enough he mumbled
Oh you do
roared Freckles
Well this aint your say
You come on to me ground lying about me Boss and intimatin Id stale from his very pockets
Now will you be standing up and taking your medicine like a man or getting it poured down the throat of you like a baby
I aint got enough
This is only just the beginning with me
Be looking out there
He sprang against Wessner and sent him rolling
He attacked the unresisting figure and fought him until he lay limp and quiet and Freckles had no strength left to lift an arm
Then he arose and stepped back gasping for breath
With his first lungful of air he shouted Time
But the figure of Wessner lay motionless
Freckles watched him with regardful eye and saw at last that he was completely exhausted
He bent over him and catching him by the back of the neck jerked him to his knees
Wessner lifted the face of a whipped cur and fearing further punishment burst into shivering sobs while the tears washed tiny rivulets through the blood and muck
Freckles stepped back glaring at Wessner but suddenly the scowl of anger and the ugly disfiguring red faded from the boys face
He dabbed at a cut on his temple from which issued a tiny crimson stream and jauntily shook back his hair
His face took on the innocent look of a cherub and his voice rivaled that of a brooding dove but into his eyes crept a look of diabolical mischief
He glanced vaguely around him until he saw his club seized and twirled it as a drum major stuck it upright in the muck and marched on tiptoe to Wessner mechanically as a puppet worked by a string
Bending over Freckles reached an arm around Wessners waist and helped him to his feet
Careful now he cautioned be careful Freddy theres danger of you hurting me
Drawing a handkerchief from a back pocket Freckles tenderly wiped Wessners eyes and nose
Come Freddy me child he admonished Wessner its time little boys were going home
Ive me work to do and cant be entertaining you any more today
Come back tomorrow if you aint through yet and well repate the perfarmance
Dont be staring at me so wild like
I would eat you but I cant afford it
Me earnings being honest come slow and Ive no money to be squanderin on the pailful of Dyspeptics Delight it would be to taking to work you out of my innards
Again an awful wrenching seized McLean
Freckles stepped back as Wessner tottering and reeling as a thoroughly drunken man came toward the path appearing indeed as if wildcats had attacked him
The cudgel spun high in air and catching it with an expertness acquired by long practice on the line the boy twirled it a second shook back his thick hair bonnily and stepping into the trail followed Wessner
Because Freckles was Irish it was impossible to do it silently so presently his clear tenor rang out though there were bad catches where he was hard pressed for breath It was the Dutch
It was the Dutch
Do you think it was the Irish hollered help
Not much
It was the Dutch
It was the Dutch Wessner turned and mumbled What you following me for
What are you going to do with me
Freckles called the Limberlost to witness Hows that for the ingratitude of a beast
And me troubling mesilf to show him off me territory with the honors of war
Then he changed his tone completely and added Belike its this Freddy
You see the Boss might come riding down this trail any minute and the little mares so wheedlesome that if shed come on to you in your prisint state all of a sudden shed stop that short shed send Mr McLean out over the ears of her
No disparagement intinded to the sinse of the mare
he added hastily
Wessner belched a fearful oath while Freckles laughed merrily
Thats a sample of the thanks a generous acts always for getting he continued
Heres me negictin me work to eschort you out proper and you saying such awful words Freddy he demanded sternly do you want me to soap out your mouth
You dont seem to be realizing it but if you was to buck into Mr McLean in your prisint state without me there to explain matters the chance is hed cut the liver out of you and I shouldnt think youd be wanting such a fine gintleman as him to see that its white
Wessner grew ghastly under his grime and broke into a staggering run
And now will you be looking at the manners of him
questioned Freckles plaintively
Going without even a thank you right in the face of all the pains Ive taken to make it interesting for him
Freckles twirled the club and stood as a soldier at attention until Wessner left the clearing but it was the last scene of that performance
When the boy turned there was deathly illness on his face while his legs wavered beneath his weight
He staggered to the case and opening it he took out a piece of cloth
He dipped it into the water and sitting on a bench he wiped the blood and grime from his face while his breath sucked between his clenched teeth
He was shivering with pain and excitement in spite of himself
He unbuttoned the band of his right sleeve and turning it back exposed the bluelined calloused whiteness of his maimed arm now vividly streaked with contusions while in a series of circular dots the blood oozed slowly
Here Wessner had succeeded in setting his teeth
When Freckles saw what it was he forgave himself the kick in the pit of Wessners stomach and cursed fervently and deep
Freckles Freckles said McLeans voice
Freckles snatched down his sleeve and arose to his feet
Excuse me sir he said
Youll surely be belavin I thought meself alone
McLean pushed him carefully to the seat and bending over him opened a pocketcase that he carried as regularly as his revolver and watch for cuts and bruises were of daily occurrence among the gang
Taking the hurt arm he turned back the sleeve and bathed and bound the wounds
He examined Freckles head and body and convinced himself that there was no permanent injury although the cruelty of the punishment the boy had borne set the Boss shuddering
Then he closed the case shoved it into his pocket and sat beside Freckles
All the indescribable beauty of the place was strong around him but he saw only the bruised face of the suffering boy who had hedged for the information he wanted as a diplomat argued as a judge fought as a sheik and triumphed as a devil
When the pain lessened and breath reieved Freckles pounding heart he watched the Boss covertly
How had McLean gotten there and how long had he been there
Freckles did not dare ask
At last he arose and going to the case took out his revolver and the wire mending apparatus and locked the door
Then he turned to McLean
Have you any orders sir
he asked
Yes said McLean I have and you are to follow them to the letter
Turn over that apparatus to me and go straight home
Soak yourself in the hottest bath your skin will bear and go to bed at once
Now hurry
Mr McLean said Freckles its sorry I am to be telling you but the afternoons walking of the line aint done
You see I was just for getting to me feet to start and I was on time when up came a gintleman and we got into a little heated argument
Its either settled or its just begun but between us Im that late I havent started for the afternoon yet
I must be going at once for theres a tree I must find before the days over
You plucky little idiot growled McLean
You cant walk the line
I doubt if you can reach Duncans
Dont you know when you are done up
You go to bed Ill finish your work
Niver
protested Freckles
I was just a little done up for the prisint a minute ago
Im all right now
Ridingboots are far too low
The days hot and the walk a good seven miles sir
Niver
As he reached for the outfit he pitched forward and his eyes closed
McLean stretched him on the moss and applied restoratives
When Freckles returned to consciousness McLean ran to the cabin to tell Mrs Duncan to have a hot bath ready and to bring Nellie
That worthy woman promptly filled the washboiler starting a roaring fire under it
She pushed the horsetrough from its base and rolled it to the kitchen
By the time McLean came again leading Nelie and holding Freckles on her back Mrs Duncan was ready for business
She and the Boss laid Freckles in the trough and poured on hot water until he squirmed
They soaked and massaged him
Then they drew off the hot water and closed his pores with cold
Lastly they stretched him on the floor and chafed rubbed and kneaded him until he cried out for mercy
As they rolled him into bed his eyes dropped shut but a little later they flared open
Mr McLean he cried the tree
Oh do be looking after the tree
McLean bent over him
Which tree Freckles
I dont know exact sir but its on the east line and the wire is fastened to it
He bragged that you nailed it yourself sir
Youll know it by the bark having been laid open to the grain somewhere low down
Five hundred dollars he offered meto be selling you outsir
Freckles head rolled over and his eyes dropped shut
McLean towered above the lad
His bright hair waved on the pillow
His face was swollen and purple with bruises
His left arm with the hand battered almost out of shape stretched beside him and the right with no hand at all lay across a chest that was a mass of purple welts
McLeans mind traveled to the night almost a year before when he had engaged Freckles a stranger
The Boss bent covering the hurt arm with one hand and laying the other with a caress on the boys forehead
Freckles stirred at his touch and whispered as softly as the swallows under the eaves If youre coming this waytomorrowbe pleased to step over and well repatethe chorus softly
Bless the gritty devil muttered McLean
Then he went out and told Mrs Duncan to keep close watch on Freckles also to send Duncan to him at the swamp the minute he came home
Following the trail to the line and back to the scent of the fight the Boss entered Freckles study quietly as if his spirit keeping there might be roused and gazed around with astonished eyes
How had the boy conceived it
What a picture he had wrought in living colors
He had the heart of a painter
He had the soul of a poet
The Boss stepped carefully over the velvet carpet to touch the walls of crisp verdure with gentle fingers
He stood long beside the flower bed and gazed at the banked wall of bright bloom as if he doubted its reality
Where had Freckles ever found and how had he transplanted such ferns
As McLean turned from them he stopped suddenly
He had reached the door of the cathedral
That which Freckles had attempted would have been patent to anyone
What had been in the heart of the shy silent boy when he had found that long dim stretch of forest decorated its entrance cleared and smoothed its aisle and carpeted its altar
What veriest work of God was in these mighty living pillars and the arched dome of green
How similar to stained cathedral windows were the long openings between the trees filled with rifts of blue rays of gold and the shifting emerald of leaves
Where could be found mosaics to match this aisle paved with living color and glowing light
Was Freckles a devout Christian and did he worship here
Or was he an untaught heathen and down this vista of entrancing loveliness did Pan come piping and dryads nymphs and fairies dance for him
Who can fathom the heart of a boy
McLean had been thinking of Freckles as a creature of unswerving honesty courage and faithfulness
Here was evidence of a heart aching for beauty art companionship worship
It was writ large all over the floor walls and furnishing of that little Limberlost clearing
When Duncan came McLean told him the story of the fight and they laughed until they cried
Then they started around the line in search of the tree
Said Duncan Now the boy is in for sore trouble
I hope not answered McLean
You never in all your life saw a cur whipped so completely
He wont come back for the repetition of the chorus
We surely can find the tree
If we cant Freckles can
I will bring enough of the gang to take it out at once
That will insure peace for a time at least and I am hoping that in a month more the whole gang may be moved here
It soon will be fall and then if he will go I intend to send Freckles to my mother to be educated
With his quickness of mind and body and a few years good help he can do anything
Why Duncan Id give a hundred dollar bill if you could have been here and seen for yourself
Yes and Id a done murder muttered the big teamster
I hope sir ye will make good your plans for Freckles though Id as soon see ony born child o my ain taken from our home
We love the lad me and Sarah
Locating the tree was easy because it was so well identified
When the rumble of the big lumber wagons passing the cabin on the way to the swamp wakened Freckles next morning he sprang up and was soon following them
He was so sore and stiff that every movement was torture at first but he grew easier and shortly did not suffer so much
McLean scolded him for coming yet in his heart triumphed over every new evidence of fineness in the boy
The tree was a giant maple and so precious that they almost dug it out by the roots
When it was down cut in lengths and loaded there was yet an empty wagon
As they were gathering up their tools to go Duncan said Theres a big hollow tree somewhere mighty close here that Ive been wanting for a wateringtrough for my stock the one I have is so small
The Portland company cut this for elm butts last year and its six feet diameter and hollow for forty feet
It was a buster
While the men are here and there is an empty wagon why mightnt I load it on and tak it up to the barn as we pass
McLean said he was very willing ordered the driver to break line and load the log detailing men to assist
He told Freckles to ride on a section of the maple with him but now the boy asked to enter the swamp with Duncan
I dont see why you want to go said McLean
I have no business to let you out today at all
Its me chickens whispered Freckles in distress
You see I was just after finding yesterday from me new book how they do be nesting in hollow trees and there aint any too many in the swamp
Theres just a chance that they might be in that one
Go ahead said McLean
Thats a different story
If they happen to be there why tell Duncan he must give up the tree until they have finished with it
Then he climbed on a wagon and was driven away
Freckles hurried into the swamp
He was a little behind yet he could see the men
Before he overtook them they had turned from the west road and had entered the swamp toward the east
They stopped at the trunk of a monstrous prostrate log
It had been cut three feet from the ground over threefourths of the way through and had fallen toward the east the body of the log still resting on the stump
The underbrush was almost impenetrable but Duncan plunged in and with a crowbar began tapping along the trunk to decide how far it was hollow so that they would know where to cut
As they waited his decision there came from the mouth of iton wingsa large black bird that swept over their heads
Freckles danced wildly
Its me chickens
Oh its me chickens
he shouted
Oh Duncan come quick
Youve found the nest of me precious chickens
Duncan hurried to the mouth of the log but Freckles was before him
He crashed through poisonvines and underbrush regardless of any danger and climbed on the stump
When Duncan came he was shouting like a wild man
Its hatched
he yelled
Oh me big chicken has hatched out me little chicken and theres another egg
I can see it plain and oh the funny little white baby
Oh Duncan can you see me little white chicken
Duncan could easily see it so could everyone else
Freckles crept into the log and tenderly carried the hissing blinking little bird to the light in a leaflined hat
The men found it sufficiently wonderful to satisfy even Freckles who had forgotten he was ever sore or stiff and coddled over it with every blarneying term of endearment he knew
Duncan gathered his tools
Deals off boys
he said cheerfully
This log mauna be touched until Freckles chaukies have finished with it
We might as weel gang
Better put it back Freckles
Its just out and it may chill
Ye will probably hae twa the morn
Freckles crept into the log and carefully deposited the baby beside the egg
When he came back he said I made a big mistake not to be bringing the egg out with the baby but I was fearing to touch it
Its shaped like a hens egg and its big as a turkeys and the beautifulest bluejust splattered with big brown splotches like me book said precise
Bet you never saw such a sight as it made on the yellow of the rotten wood beside that funny leatheryfaced little white baby
Tell you what Freckles said one of the teamsters
Have you ever heard of this Bird Woman who goes all over the country with a camera and makes pictures
She made some on my brother Jims place last summer and Jims so wild about them he quits plowing and goes after her about every nest he finds
He helps her all he can to take them and then she gives him a picture
Jims so proud of what he has he keeps them in the Bible
He shows them to everybody that comes and brags about how he helped
If youre smart youll send for her and shell come and make a picture just like life
If you help her she will give you one
It would be uncommon pretty to keep after your birds are gone
I dunno what they are
I never see their like before
They must be something rare
Any you fellows ever see a bird like that hereabouts
No one ever had
Well said the teamster failing to get this log lets me off till noon and Im going to town
I go right past her place
Ive a big notion to stop and tell her
If she drives straight back in the swamp on the west road and turns east at this big sycamore she cant miss finding the tree even if Freckles aint here to show her
Jim says her work is a credit to the State she lives in and any man is a measly creature who isnt willing to help her all he can
My old daddy used to say that all there was to religion was doing to the other fellow what youd want him to do to you and if I was making a living taking bird pictures seems to me Id be mighty glad for a chance to take one like that
So Ill just stop and tell her and by gummy
maybe she will give me a picture of the little white sucker for my trouble
Freckles touched his arm
Will she be rough with it
he asked
Government land
No
said the teamster
Shes dead down on anybody that shoots a bird or tears up a nest
Why shes half killing herself in all kinds of places and weather to teach people to love and protect the birds
Shes that plum careful of them that Jims wife says she has Jim a standin like a big fool holding an ombrelly over them when they are young and tender until she gets a focus whatever that is
Jim says there aint a bird on his place that dont actually seem to like having her around after she has wheedled them a few days and the pictures she takes nobody would ever believe who didnt stand by and see
Will you he sure to tell her to come
asked Freckles
Duncan slept at home that night
He heard Freckles slipping out early the next morning but he was too sleepy to wonder why until he came to do his morning chores
When he found that none of his stock was at all thirsty and saw the watertrough brimming he knew that the boy was trying to make up to him for the loss of the big trough that he had been so anxious to have
Bless his fool little hot heart
said Duncan
And him so sore it is tearing him to move for anything
Nae wonder he has us all loving him
Freckles was moving briskly and his heart was so happy that he forgot all about the bruises
He hurried around the trail and on his way down the east side he went to see the chickens
The mother bird was on the nest
He was afraid the other egg might be hatching so he did not venture to disturb her
He made the round and reached his study early
He ate his lunch but did not need to start on the second trip until the middle of the afternoon
He would have long hours to work on his flower bed improve his study and learn about his chickens
Lovingly he set his room in order and watered the flowers and carpet
He had chosen for his restingplace the coolest spot on the west side where there was almost always a breeze but today the heat was so intense that it penetrated even there
Im mighty glad theres nothing calling me inside
he said
Theres no bit of air stirring and it will just be steaming
Oh but its luck Duncan found the nest before it got so unbearing hot
I might have missed it altogether
Wouldnt it have been a shame to lose that sight
The cunning little divil
When he gets to toddling down that log to meet me wont he be a circus
Wonder if hell be as graceful a performer afoot as his father and mother
The heat became more insistent
Noon came Freckles ate his dinner and settled for an hour or two on a bench with a book
CHAPTER V Wherein an Angel Materializes and a Man Worships Perhaps there was a breath of soundFreckles never afterward could rememberbut for some reason he lifted his head as the bushes parted and the face of an angel looked between
Saints nymphs and fairies had floated down his cathedral aisle for him many times with forms and voices of exquisite beauty
Parting the wild roses at the entrance was beauty of which Freckles never had dreamed
Was it real or would it vanish as the other dreams
He dropped his book and rising to his feet went a step closer gazing intently
This was real flesh and blood
It was in every way kin to the Limberlost for no bird of its branches swung with easier grace than this dainty young thing rocked on the bit of morass on which she stood
A sapling beside her was not straighter or rounder than her slender form
Her soft waving hair clung around her face from the heat and curled over her shoulders
It was all of one piece with the gold of the sun that filtered between the branches
Her eyes were the deepest blue of the iris her lips the reddest red of the foxfire while her cheeks were exactly of the same satin as the wild rose petals caressing them
She was smiling at Freckles in perfect confidence and she cried Oh Im so delighted that Ive found you
The wildly leaping heart of Freckles burst from his body and fell in the black swampmuck at her feet with such a thud that he did not understand how she could avoid hearing
He really felt that if she looked down she would see
Incredulous he quavered Anan was you looking for me
I hoped I might find you said the Angel
You see I didnt do as I was told and Im lost
The Bird Woman said I should wait in the carriage until she came back
Shes been gone hours
Its a perfect Turkish bath in there and Im all lumpy with mosquito bites
Just when I thought that I couldnt bear it another minute along came the biggest Papilio Ajax you ever saw
I knew how pleased shed be so I ran after it
It flew so slow and so low that I thought a dozen times I had it
Then all at once it went from sight above the trees and I couldnt find my way back to save me
I think Ive walked more than an hour
I have been mired to my knees
A thorn raked my arm until it is bleeding and Im so tired and warm
She parted the bushes farther
Freckles saw that her blue cotton frock clung to her limp with perspiration
It was torn across the breast
One sleeve hung open from shoulder to elbow
A thorn had torn her arm until it was covered with blood and the gnats and mosquitoes were clustering around it
Her feet were in lace hose and low shoes
Freckles gasped
In the Limberlost in low shoes
He caught an armful of moss from his carpet and buried it in the ooze in front of her for a footing
Come out here so I can see where you are stepping
Quick for the life of you
he ordered
She smiled on him indulgently
Why
she inquired
Did anybody let you come here and not be telling you of the snakes
urged Freckles
We met Mr McLean on the corduroy and he did say something about snakes I believe
The Bird Woman put on leather leggings and a nice parboiled time she must be having
Worst dose I ever endured and Id nothing to do but swelter
Will you be coming out of there
groaned Freckles
She laughed as if it were a fine joke
Maybe if Id be telling you I killed a rattler curled upon that same place youre standing as long as me body and the thickness of me arm youd be moving where I can see your footing he urged insistently
What a perfectly delightful little brogue you speak she said
My father is Irish and half should be enough to entitle me to that much
Maybeif Idbe telling you she imitated rounding and accenting each word carefully
Freckles was beginning to feel a wildness in his head
He had derided Wessner at that same hour yesterday
Now his own eyes were filling with tears
If you were understanding the danger
he continued desperately
Oh I dont think there is much
She tilted on the morass
If you killed one snake here its probably all there is near and anyway the Bird Woman says a rattlesnake is a gentleman and always gives warning before he strikes
I dont hear any rattling
Do you
Would you be knowing it if you did
asked Freckles almost impatiently
How the laugh of the young thing rippled
Would I be knowing it
she mocked
You should see the swamps of Michigan where they dump rattlers from the marldredgers three and four at a time
Freckles stood astounded
She did know
She was not in the least afraid
She was depending on a rattlesnake to live up to his share of the contract and rattle in time for her to move
The one characteristic an Irishman admires in a woman above all others is courage
Freckles worshiped anew
He changed his tactics
Id be pleased to be receiving you at me front door he said but as you have arrived at the back will you come in and be seated
He waved toward a bench
The Angel came instantly
Oh how lovely and cool
she cried
As she moved across his room Freckles had difficult work to keep from falling on his knees for they were very weak while he was hard driven by an impulse to worship
Did you arrange this
she asked
Yis said Freckles simply
Someone must come with a big canvas and copy each side of it she said
I never saw anything so beautiful
How I wish I might remain here with you
I will some day if you will let me but now if you can spare the time will you help me find the carriage
If the Bird Woman comes back and I am gone she will be almost distracted
Did you come on the west road
asked Freckles
I think so she said
The man who told the Bird Woman said that was the only place the wires were down
We drove away in and it was dreadfulover stumps and logs and we mired to the hubs
I suppose you know though
I should have stayed in the carriage but I was so tired
I never dreamed of getting lost
I suspect I will be scolded finely
I go with the Bird Woman half the time during the summer vacations
My father says I learn a lot more than I do at school and get it straight
I never came within a smell of being lost before
I thought at first it was going to be horrid but since Ive found you maybe it will be good fun after all
Freckles was amazed to hear himself excusing It was so hot in there
You couldnt be expected to bear it for hours and not be moving
I can take you around the trail almost to where you were
Then you can sit in the carriage and I will go find the Bird Woman
Youll be killed if you do
When she stays this long it means that she has a focus on something
You see when she has a focus and lies in the weeds and water for hours and the sun bakes her and things crawl over her and then someone comes along and scares her bird away just as she has it coaxed upwhy she kills them
If I melt you wont go after her
Shes probably blistered and half eaten up but she never will quit until she is satisfied
Then it will be safer to be taking care of you suggested Freckles
Now youre talking sense
said the Angel
May I try to help your arm
he asked
Have you any idea how it hurts
she parried
A little said Freckles
Well Mr McLean said Wed probably find his son here His son
cried Freckles
Thats what he said
And that you would do anything you could for us and that we could trust you with our lives
But I would have trusted you anyway if I hadnt known a thing about you
Say your father is rampaging proud of you isnt he
I dont know answered the dazed Freckles
Well call on me if you want reliable information
Hes so proud of you he is all swelled up like the toad in AEsops Fables
If you have ever had an arm hurt like this and can do anything why for pity sake do it
She turned back her sleeve holding toward Freckles an arm of palest cameo shaped so exquisitely that no sculptor could have chiseled it
Freckles unlocked his case and taking out some cotton cloth he tore it in strips
Then he brought a bucket of the cleanest water he could find
She yielded herself to his touch as a baby and he bathed away the blood and bandaged the ugly ragged wound
He finished his surgery by lapping the torn sleeve over the cloth and binding it down with a piece of twine with the Angels help about the knots
Freckles worked with trembling fingers and a face tense with earnestness
Is it feeling any better
he asked
Oh its well now
cried the Angel
It doesnt hurt at all any more
Im mighty glad said Freckles
But you had best go and be having your doctor fix it right the minute you get home
Oh bother
A little scratch like that
jeered the Angel
My blood is perfectly pure
It will heal in three days
Its cut cruel deep
It might be making a scar faltered Freckles his eyes on the ground
Twouldtwould be an awful pity
A doctor might know something to prevent it
Why I never thought of that
exclaimed the Angel
I noticed you didnt said Freckles softly
I dont know much about it but it seems as if most girls would
The Angel thought intently while Freckles still knelt beside her
Suddenly she gave herself an impatient little shake lifted her glorious eyes full to his and the smile that swept her sweet young face was the loveliest thing that Freckles ever had seen
Dont lets bother about it she proposed with the faintest hint of a confiding gesture toward him
It wont make a scar
Why it couldnt when you have dressed it so nicely
The velvety touch of her warm arm was tingling in Freckles fingertips
Dainty lace and fine white ribbon peeped through her torn dress
There were beautiful rings on her fingers
Every article she wore was of the finest material and in excellent taste
There was the trembling Limberlost guard in his coarse clothing with his cotton rags and his old pail of swamp water
Freckles was sufficiently accustomed to contrasts to notice them and sufficiently fine to be hurt by them always
He lifted his eyes with a shadowy pain in them to hers and found them of serene unconscious purity
What she had said was straight from a kind untainted young heart
She meant every word of it
Freckles soul sickened
He scarcely knew whether he could muster strength to stand
We must go and hunt for the carriage said the Angel rising
In instant alarm for her Freckles sprang up grasped the cudgel and led the way sharply watching every step
He went as close the log as he felt that he dared and with a little searching found the carriage
He cleared a path for the Angel and with a sigh of relief saw her enter it safely
The heat was intense
She pushed the damp hair from her temples
This is a shame
said Freckles
Youll never be coming here again
Oh yes I shall
said the Angel
The Bird Woman says that these birds remain over a month in the nest and she would like to make a picture every few days for seven or eight weeks perhaps
Freckles barely escaped crying aloud for joy
Then dont you ever be torturing yourself and your horse to be coming in here again he said
Ill show you a way to drive almost to the nest on the east trail and then you can come around to my room and stay while the Bird Woman works
Its nearly always cool there and theres comfortable seats and water
Oh
did you have drinkingwater there
she cried
I was never so thirsty or so hungry in my life but I thought I wouldnt mention it
And I had not the wit to be seeing
wailed Freckles
I can be getting you a good drink in no time
He turned to the trail
Please wait a minute called the Angel
Whats your name
I want to think about you while you are gone
Freckles lifted his face with the brown rift across it and smiled quizzically
Freckles
she guessed with a peal of laughter
And mine is Im knowing yours interrupted Freckles
I dont believe you do
What is it
asked the girl
You wont be getting angry
Not until Ive had the water at least
It was Freckles turn to laugh
He whipped off his big floppy straw hat stood uncovered before her and said in the sweetest of all the sweet tones of his voice Theres nothing you could be but the Swamp Angel
The girl laughed happily
Once out of her sight Freckles ran every step of the way to the cabin
Mrs Duncan gave him a small bucket of water cool from the well
He carried it in the crook of his right arm and a basket filled with bread and butter cold meat apple pie and pickles in his left hand
Pickles are kind o cooling said Mrs Duncan
Then Freckles ran again
The Angel was on her knees reaching for the bucket as he came up
Be drinking slow he cautioned her
Oh
she cried with a long breath of satisfaction
Its so good
You are more than kind to bring it
Freckles stood blinking in the dazzling glory of her smile until he scarcely could see to lift the basket
Mercy
she exclaimed
I think I had better be naming you the Angel
My Guardian Angel
Yis said Freckles
I look the character every daybut today most emphatic
Angels dont go by looks laughed the girl
Your father told us you had been scrapping
But he told us why
Id gladly wear all your cuts and bruises if I could do anything that would make my father look as peacocky as yours did
He strutted about proper
I never saw anyone look prouder
Did he say he was proud of me
marveled Freckles
He didnt need to answered the Angel
He was radiating pride from every pore
Now have you brought me your dinner
I had my dinner two hours ago answered Freckles
Honest Injun
bantered the Angel
Honest
I brought that on purpose for you
Well if you knew how hungry I am you would know how thankful I am to the dot said the Angel
Then you be eating cried the happy Freckles
The Angel sat on a big camera spread the lunch on the carriage seat and divided it in halves
The daintiest parts she could select she carefully put back into the basket
The remainder she ate
Again Freckles found her of the swamp for though she was almost ravenous she managed her food as gracefully as his little yellow fellow and her every movement was easy and charming
As he watched her with famished eyes Freckles told her of his birds flowers and books and never realized what he was doing
He led the horse to a deep pool that he knew of and the tortured creature drank greedily and lovingly rubbed him with its nose as he wiped down its welted body with grass
Suddenly the Angel cried There comes the Bird Woman
Freckles had intended leaving before she came but now he was glad indeed to be there for a warmer more worn and worse bitten creature he never had seen
She was staggering under a load of cameras and paraphernalia
Freckles ran to her aid
He took all he could carry of her load stowed it in the back of the carriage and helped her in
The Angel gave her water knelt and unfastened the leggings bathed her face and offered the lunch
Freckles brought the horse
He was not sure about the harness but the Angel knew and soon they left the swamp
Then he showed them how to reach the chicken tree from the outside indicated a cooler place for the horse and told them how the next time they came the Angel could find his room while she waited
The Bird Woman finished her lunch and lay back almost too tired to speak
Were you for getting Little Chickens picture
Freckles asked
Finely
she answered
He posed splendidly
But I couldnt do anything with his mother
She will require coaxing
The Lord be praised
muttered Freckles under his breath
The Bird Woman began to feel better
Why do you call the baby vulture Little Chicken
she asked leaning toward Freckles in an interested manner
Twas Duncan began it said Freckles
You see through the fierce cold of winter the birds of the swamp were almost starving
It is mighty lonely here and they were all the company I was having
I got to carrying scraps and grain down to them
Duncan was that ginerous he was giving me of his wheat and corn from his chickens feed and he called the birds me swamp chickens
Then when these big black fellows came Mr McLean said they were our nearest kind to some in the old world that they called Pharaohs Chickens and he called mine Freckles Chickens
Good enough
cried the Bird Woman her splotched purple face lighting with interest
You must shoot something for them occasionally and Ill bring more food when I come
If you will help me keep them until I get my series Ill give you a copy of each study I make mounted in a book
Freckles drew a deep breath
Ill be doing me very best he promised and from the deeps he meant it
I wonder if that other egg is going to hatch
mused the Bird Woman
I am afraid not
It should have pipped today
Isnt it a beauty
I never before saw either an egg or the young
They are rare this far north
So Mr McLean said answered Freckles
Before they drove away the Bird Woman thanked him for his kindness to the Angel and to her
She gave him her hand at parting and Freckles joyfully realized that this was going to be another person for him to love
He could not remember after they had driven away that they even had noticed his missing hand and for the first time in his life he had forgotten it
When the Bird Woman and the Angel were on the home road she told of the little corner of paradise into which she had strayed and of her new name
The Bird Woman looked at the girl and guessed its appropriateness
Did you know Mr McLean had a son
asked the Angel
Isnt the little accent he has and the way he twists a sentence too dear
And isnt it too oldfashioned and funny to hear him call his father mister
It sounds too good to be true said the Bird Woman answering the last question first
I am so tired of these presentday young men who patronizingly call their fathers Dad Governor Old Man and Old Chap that the boys attitude of respect and deference appealed to me as being fine as silk
There must be something rare about that young man
She did not find it necessary to tell the Angel that for several years she had known the man who so proudly proclaimed himself Freckles father to be a bachelor and a Scotchman
The Bird Woman had a fine way of attending strictly to her own business
Freckles turned to the trail but he stopped at every wild brier to study the pink satin of the petals
She was not of his world and better than any other he knew it but she might be his Angel and he was dreaming of naught but blind silent worship
He finished the happiest day of his life and that night he returned to the swamp as if drawn by invisible force
That Wessner would try for his revenge he knew
That he would be abetted by Black Jack was almost certain but fear had fled the happy heart of Freckles
He had kept his trust
He had won the respect of the Boss
No one ever could wipe from his heart the flood of holy adoration that had welled with the coming of his Angel
He would do his best and trust for strength to meet the dark day of reckoning that he knew would come sooner or later
He swung round the trail briskly tapping the wire and singing in a voice that scarcely could have been surpassed for sweetness
At the edge of the clearing he came into the bright moonlight and there sat McLean on his mare
Freckles hurried to him
Is there trouble
he inquired anxiously
Thats what I wanted to ask you said the Boss
I stopped at the cabin to see you a minute before I turned in and they said you had come down here
You must not do it Freckles
The swamp is none too healthful at any time and at night it is rank poison
Freckles stood combing his fingers through Nellies mane while the dainty creature was twisting her head for his caresses
He pushed back his hat and looked into McLeans face
Its come to the sleep with one eye open sir
Im not looking for anything to be happening for a week or two but its bound to come and soon
If Im to keep me trust as Ive promised you and meself Ive to live here mostly until the gang comes
You must be knowing that sir
Im afraid its true Freckles said McLean
And Ive decided to double the guard until we come
It will be only a few weeks now and Im so anxious for you that you must not be left alone further
If anything should happen to you Freckles it would spoil one of the very dearest plans of my life
Freckles heard with dismay the proposition to place a second guard
Oh
no no Mr McLean he cried
Not for the world
I wouldnt be having a stranger around scaring me birds and tramping up me study and disturbing all me ways for any money
I am all the guard you need
I will be faithful
I will turn over the lease with no tree missingon me life I will
Oh dont be sending another man to set them saying I turned coward and asked for help
It will just kill the honor of me heart if you do it
The only thing I want is another gun
If it railly comes to trouble six cartridges aint many and you know I am slowlike about reloading
McLean reached into his hip pocket and handed a shining big revolver to Freckles who slipped it beside the one already in his belt
Then the Boss sat brooding
Freckles he said at last we never know the timber of a mans soul until something cuts into him deeply and brings the grain out strong
Youve the making of a mighty fine piece of furniture my boy and you shall have your own way these few weeks yet
Then if you will go I intend to take you to the city and educate you and you are to be my son my ladmy own son
Freckles twisted his finger in Nellies mane to steady himself
But why should you be doing that sir
he faltered
McLean slid his arm around the boys shoulder and gathered him close
Because I love you Freckles he said simply
Freckles lifted a white face
My God sir
he whispered
Oh my God
McLean tightened his clasp a second longer then he rode down the trail
Freckles lifted his hat and faced the sky
The harvest moon looked down sheeting the swamp in silver glory
The Limberlost sang her night song
The swale softly rustled in the wind
Winged things of night brushed his face and still Freckles gazed upward trying to fathom these things that had come to him
There was no help from the sky
It seemed far away cold and blue
The earth where flowers blossomed angels walked and love could be found was better
But to One above he must make acknowledgment for these miracles
His lips moved and he began talking softly
Thank You for each separate good thing that has come to me he said and above all for the falling of the feather
For if it didnt really fall from an angel its falling brought an Angel and if its in the great heart of you to exercise yourself any further about me oh do please to be taking good care of her
CHAPTER VI Wherein a Fight Occurs and Women Shoot Straight The following morning Freckles inexpressibly happy circled the Limberlost
He kept snatches of song ringing as well as the wires
His heart was so full that tears of joy glistened in his eyes
He rigorously strove to divide his thought evenly between McLean and the Angel
He realized to the fullest the debt he already owed the Boss and the magnitude of last nights declaration and promises
He was hourly planning to deliver his trust and then enter with equal zeal on whatever task his beloved Boss saw fit to set him next
He wanted to be ready to meet every device that Wessner and Black Jack could think of to outwit him
He recognized their double leverage for if they succeeded in felling even one tree McLean became liable for his wager
Freckles brow wrinkled in his effort to think deeply and strongly but from every swaying wild rose the Angel beckoned to him
When he crossed Sleepy Snake Creek and the goldfinch waiting as ever challenged SEE ME
Freckles saw the dainty swaying grace of the Angel instead
What is a man to do with an Angel who dismembers herself and scatters over a whole swamp thrusting a vivid reminder upon him at every turn
Freckles counted the days
This first one he could do little but test his wires sing broken snatches and dream but before the week would bring her again he could do many things
He would carry all his books to the swamp to show to her
He would complete his flower bed arrange every detail he had planned for his room and make of it a bower fairies might envy
He must devise a way to keep water cool
He would ask Mrs Duncan for a double lunch and an especially nice one the day of her next coming so that if the Bird Woman happened to be late the Angel might not suffer from thirst and hunger
He would tell her to bring heavy leather leggings so that he might take her on a trip around the trail
She should make friends with all of his chickens and see their nests
On the line he talked of her incessantly
You neednt be thinking he said to the goldfinch that because Im coming down this line alone day after day its always to be so
Some of these times youll be swinging on this wire and youll see me coming and youll swing skip and flirt yourself around and chip up right spunky SEE ME
Ill be saying See you
Oh Lord
See her
Youll look and there shell stand
The sunshine wont look gold any more or the roses pink or the sky blue because shell be the pinkest bluest goldest thing of all
Youll be yelling yourself hoarse with the jealousy of her
The sawbird will stretch his neck out of joint and shell turn the heads of all the flowers
Wherever she goes I can go back afterward and see the things shes seen walk the path shes walked hear the grasses whispering over all shes said and if theres a place too swampy for her bits of feet Holy Mother
Maybemaybe shed be putting the beautiful arms of her around me neck and letting me carry her over
Freckles shivered as with a chill
He sent the cudgel whirling skyward dexterously caught it and set it spinning
You damned presumptuous fool
he cried
The thing for you to be thinking of would be to stretch in the muck for the feet of her to be walking over and then you could hold yourself holy to be even of that service to her
Maybe shell be wanting the cup me blueandbrown chickens raised their babies in
Perhaps shed like to stop at the pool and see me bullfrog that had the goodness to take on human speech to show me the way out of me trouble
If theres any feathers falling that day why its from the wings of me chickensits sure to be for the only Angel outside the gates will be walking this timberline and every step of the way Ill be holding me breath and praying that she dont unfold wings and sail away before the hungry eyes of me
So Freckles dreamed his dreams made his plans and watched his line
He counted not only the days but the hours of each day
As he told them off every one bringing her closer he grew happier in the prospect of her coming
He managed daily to leave some offering at the big elm log for his black chickens
He slipped under the line at every passing and went to make sure that nothing was molesting them
Though it was a long trip he paid them several extra visits a day for fear a snake hawk or fox might have found the baby
For now his chickens not only represented all his former interest in them but they furnished the inducement that was bringing his Angel
Possibly he could find other subjects that the Bird Woman wanted
The teamster had said that his brother went after her every time he found a nest
He never had counted the nests that he knew of and it might be that among all the birds of the swamp some would be rare to her
The feathered folk of the Limberlost were practically undisturbed save by their natural enemies
It was very probable that among his chickens others as odd as the big black ones could be found
If she wanted pictures of halfgrown birds he could pick up fifty in one mornings trip around the line for he had fed handled and made friends with them ever since their eyes opened
He had gathered bugs and worms all spring as he noticed them on the grass and bushes and dropped them into the first little open mouth he had found
The babies gladly had accepted this queer triparent addition to their natural providers
When the week had passed Freckles had his room crisp and glowing with fresh living things that represented every color of the swamp
He carried bark and filled all the muckiest places of the trail
It was middle July
The heat of the past few days had dried the water around and through the Limberlost so that it was possible to cross it on foot in almost any directionif one had an idea of direction and did not become completely lost in its rank tangle of vegetation and bushes
The brighterhued flowers were opening
The trumpetcreepers were flaunting their gorgeous horns of red and gold sweetness from the tops of lordly oak and elm and below entire pools were pinksheeted in mallow bloom
The heat was doing one other thing that was bound to make Freckles as a good Irishman shiver
As the swale dried its inhabitants were seeking the cooler depths of the swamp
They liked neither the heat nor leaving the field mice moles and young rabbits of their chosen location
He saw them crossing the trail every day as the heat grew intense
The rattlers were sadly forgetting their manners for they struck on no provocation whatever and did not even remember to rattle afterward
Daily Freckles was compelled to drive big black snakes and blue racers from the nests of his chickens
Often the terrified squalls of the parent birds would reach him far down the line and he would run to rescue the babies
He saw the Angel when the carriage turned from the corduroy into the clearing
They stopped at the west entrance to the swamp waiting for him to precede them down the trail as he had told them it was safest for the horse that he should do
They followed the east line to a point opposite the big chickens tree and Freckles carried in the cameras and showed the Bird Woman a path he had cleared to the log
He explained to her the effect the heat was having on the snakes and creeping back to Little Chicken brought him to the light
As she worked at setting up her camera he told her of the birds of the line while she stared at him wideeyed and incredulous
They arranged that Freckles should drive the carriage into the east entrance in the shade and then take the horse toward the north to a better place he knew
Then he was to entertain the Angel at his study or on the line until the Bird Woman finished her work and came to them
This will take only a little time she said
I know where to set the camera now and Little Chicken is big enough to be good and too small to run away or to act very ugly so I will be coming soon to see about those nests
I have ten plates along and I surely wont use more than two on him so perhaps I can get some nests or young birds this morning
Freckles almost flew for his dream had come true so soon
He was walking the timberline and the Angel was following him
He asked to be excused for going first because he wanted to be sure the trail was safe for her
She laughed at his fears telling him that it was the polite thing for him to do anyway
Oh
said Freckles so you was after knowing that
Well I didnt spose you did and I was afraid youd think me wanting in respect to be preceding you
The astonished Angel looked at him caught the irrepressible gleam of Irish fun in his eyes so they stood and laughed together
Freckles did not realize how he was talking that morning
He showed her many of the beautiful nests and eggs of the line
She could identify a number of them but of some she was ignorant so they made notes of the number and color of the eggs material and construction of nest color size and shape of the birds and went to find them in the book
At his room when Freckles had lifted the overhanging bushes and stepped back for her to enter his heart was all out of time and place
The study was vastly more beautiful than a week previous
The Angel drew a deep breath and stood gazing first at one side then at another then far down the cathedral aisle
Its just fairyland
she cried ecstatically
Then she turned and stared at Freckles as she had at his handiwork
What are you planning to be
she asked wonderingly
Whatever Mr McLean wants me to he replied
What do you do most
she asked
Watch me lines
I dont mean work
Oh in me spare time I keep me room and study in me books
Do you work on the room or the books most
On the room only what it takes to keep it up and the rest of the time on me books
The Angel studied him closely
Well maybe you are going to be a great scholar she said but you dont look it
Your face isnt right for that but its got something big in itsomething really great
I must find out what it is and then you must work on it
Your father is expecting you to do something
One can tell by the way he talks
You should begin right away
Youve wasted too much time already
Poor Freckles hung his head
He never had wasted an hour in his life
There never had been one that was his to waste
The Angel studying him intently read the thought in his face
Oh I dont mean that
she cried with the frank dismay of sixteen
Of course youre not lazy
No one ever would think that from your appearance
Its this I mean there is something fine strong and full of power in your face
There is something you are to do in this world and no matter how you work at all these other things or how successfully you do them it is all wasted until you find the ONE THING that you can do best
If you hadnt a thing in the world to keep you and could go anywhere you please and do anything you want what would you do
persisted the Angel
Id go to Chicago and sing in the First Episcopal choir answered Freckles promptly
The Angel dropped on a seatthe hat she had removed and held in her fingers rolled to her feet
There
she exclaimed vehemently
You can see what Im going to be
Nothing
Absolutely nothing
You can sing
Of course you can sing
It is written all over you
Anyone with half wit could have seen he could sing without having to be told she thought
Its in the slenderness of his fingers and his quick nervous touch
It is in the brightness of his hair the fire of his eyes the breadth of his chest the muscles of his throat and neck and above all its in every tone of his voice for even as he speak its the sweetest sound I ever heard from the throat of a mortal
Will you do something for me
she asked
Ill do anything in the world you want me to said Freckles largely and if I cant do what you want Ill go to work at once and Ill try til I can
Good
Thats business
said the Angel
You go over there and stand before that hedge and sing something
Just anything you think of first
Freckles faced the Angel from his banked wall of brown blue and crimson with its background of solid green and lifting his face to the sky he sang the first thing that came into his mind
It was a childrens song that he had led for the little folks at the Home many times recalled to his mind by the Angels exclamation To fairyland we go With a song of joy heigho
In dreams well stand upon that shore And all the realm behold Well see the sights so grand That belong to fairyland Its mysteries we will explore Its beauties will unfold
Oh tra la la oh ha ha ha
Were happy now as we can be Our welcome song we will prolong and greet you with our melody
O fairyland sweet fairyland we love to sing No song could have given the intense sweetness and rollicking quality of Freckles voice better scope
He forgot everything but pride in his work
He was singing the chorus and the Angel was shivering in ecstasy when clip
clip
came the sharply beating feet of a swiftly ridden horse down the trail from the north
They both sprang toward the entrance
Freckles
Freckles
called the voice of the Bird Woman
They were at the trail on the instant
Both those revolvers loaded
she asked
Yes said Freckles
Is there a way you can cut across the swamp and reach the chicken tree in a few minutes and with little noise
Yes
Then go flying said the Bird Woman
Give the Angel a lift behind me and we will ride the horse back where you left him and wait for you
I finished Little Chicken in no time and put him back
His mother came so close I felt sure she would enter the log
The light was fine so I set and focused the camera and covered it with branches attached the long hose and went away over a hundred feet and hid in some bushes to wait
A short stout man and a tall dark one passed me so closely I almost could have reached out and touched them
They carried a big saw on their shoulders
They said they could work until near noon and then they must lay off until you passed and then try to load and get out at night
They went onnot entirely from sightand began cutting a tree
Mr McLean told me the other day what would probably happen here and if they fell that tree he loses his wager on you
Keep to the east and north and hustle
Well meet you at the carriage
I always am armed
Give Angel one of your revolvers and you keep the other
We will separate and creep toward them from different sides and give them a fusillade that will send them flying
You hurry now
She lifted the reins and started briskly down the trail
The Angel hatless and with sparkling eyes was clinging around her waist
Freckles wheeled and ran
He worked his way with much care dodging limbs and bushes with noiseless tread and cutting as closely where he thought the men were as he felt that he dared if he were to remain unseen
As he ran he tried to think
It was Wessner burning for his revenge aided by the bully of the locality that he was going to meet
He was accustomed to that thought but not to the complication of having two women on his hands who undoubtedly would have to be taken care of in spite of the Bird Womans offer to help him
His heart was jarring as it never had before with running
He must follow the Bird Womans plan and meet them at the carriage but if they really did intend to try to help him he must not allow it
Allow the Angel to try to handle a revolver in his defence
Never
Not for all the trees in the Limberlost
She might shoot herself
She might forget to watch sharply and run across a snake that was not particularly well behaved that morning
Freckles permitted himself a grim smile as he went speeding on
When he reached the carriage the Bird Woman and the Angel had the horse hitched the outfit packed and were calmly waiting
The Bird Woman held a revolver in her hand
She wore dark clothing
They had pinned a big focusing cloth over the front of the Angels light dress
Give Angel one of your revolvers quick
said the Bird Woman
We will creep up until we are in fair range
The underbrush is so thick and they are so busy that they will never notice us if we dont make a noise
You fire first then I will pop in from my direction and then you Angel and shoot quite high or else very low
We mustnt really hit them
Well go close enough to the cowards to make it interesting and keep it up until we have them going
Freckles protested
The Bird Woman reached over and taking the smaller revolver from his belt handed it to the Angel
Keep your nerve steady dear watch where you step and shoot high she said
Go straight at them from where you are
Wait until you hear Freckles first shot then follow me as closely as you can to let them know that we outnumber them
If you want to save McLeans wager on you now you go
she commanded Freckles who with an agonized glance at the Angel ran toward the east
The Bird Woman chose the middle distance and for a last time cautioned the Angel as she moved away to lie down and shoot high
Through the underbrush the Bird Woman crept even more closely than she had intended found a clear range and waited for Freckles shot
There was one long minute of sickening suspense
The men straightened for breath
Work was difficult with a handsaw in the heat of the swamp
As they rested the big dark fellow took a bottle from his pocket and began oiling the saw
We got to keep mighty quiet he said and wait to fell it until that damned guard has gone to his dinner
Again they bent to their work
Freckles revolver spat fire
Lead spanged on steel
The sawhandle flew from Wessners hand and he reeled from the jar of the shock
Black Jack straightened uttering a fearful oath
The hat sailed from his head from the far northeast
The Angel had not waited for the Bird Woman and her shot scarcely could have been called high
At almost the same instant the third shot whistled from the east
Black Jack sprang into the air with a yell of complete panic for it ripped a heel from his boot
Freckles emptied his second chamber and the earth spattered over Wessner
Shots poured in rapidly
Without even reaching for a weapon both men ran toward the east road in great leaping bounds while leaden slugs sung and hissed around them in deadly earnest
Freckles was trimming his corners as closely as he dared but if the Angel did not really intend to hit she was taking risks in a scandalous manner
When the men reached the trail Freckles yelled at the top of his voice Head them off on the south boys
Fire from the south
As he had hoped Jack and Wessner instantly plunged into the swale
A spattering of lead followed them
They crossed the swale running low with not even one backward glance and entered the woods beyond the corduroy
Then the little party gathered at the tree
Id better fix this saw so they cant be using it if they come back said Freckles taking out his hatchet and making sawteeth fly
Now we must leave here without being seen said the Bird Woman to the Angel
It wont do for me to make enemies of these men for I am likely to meet them while at work any day
You can do it by driving straight north on this road said Freckles
I will go ahead and cut the wires for you
The swale is almost dry
You will only be sinking a little
In a few rods you will strike a cornfield
I will take down the fence and let you into that
Follow the furrows and drive straight across it until you come to the other side
Be following the fence south until you come to a road through the woods east of it
Then take that road and follow east until you reach the pike
You will come out on your way back to town and two miles north of anywhere they are likely to be
Dont for your lives ever let it out that you did this he earnestly cautioned for its black enemies you would be making
Freckles clipped the wires and they drove through
The Angel leaned from the carriage and held out his revolver
Freckles looked at her in surprise
Her eyes were black while her face was a deeper rose than usual
He felt that his own was white
Did I shoot high enough
she asked sweetly
I really forgot about lying down
Freckles winced
Did the child know how close she had gone
Surely she could not
Or was it possible that she had the nerve and skill to fire like that purposely
I will send the first reliable man I meet for McLean said the Bird Woman gathering up the lines
If I dont meet one when we reach town we will send a messenger
If it wasnt for having the gang see me I would go myself but I will promise you that you will have help in a little over two hours
You keep well hidden
They must think some of the gang is with you now
There isnt a chance that they will be back but dont run any risks
Remain under cover
If they should come it probably would be for their saw
She laughed as at a fine joke
CHAPTER VII Wherein Freckles Wins Honor and Finds a Footprint on the Trail Roundeyed Freckles watched the Bird Woman and the Angel drive away
After they were from sight and he was safely hidden among the branches of a small tree he remembered that he neither had thanked them nor said goodbye
Considering what they had been through they never would come again
His heart sank until he had palpitation in his wadingboots
Stretching the length of the limb he thought deeply though he was not thinking of Black Jack or Wessner
Would the Bird Woman and the Angel come again
No other woman whom he ever had known would
But did they resemble any other women he ever had known
He thought of the Bird Womans unruffled face and the Angels revolver practice and presently he was not so sure that they would not return
What were the people in the big world like
His knowledge was so very limited
There had been people at the Home who exchanged a stilted perfunctory kindness for their salaries
The visitors who called on receiving days he had divided into three classes the psalmsinging kind who came with a tear in the eye and hypocrisy in every feature of their faces the kind who dressed in silks and jewels and handed to those poor little motherhungry souls worn toys that their children no longer cared for in exactly the same spirit in which they pitched biscuits to the monkeys at the zoo and for the same reasonto see how they would take them and be amused by what they would do and the third class whom he considered real people
They made him feel they cared that he was there and that they would have been glad to see him elsewhere
Now here was another class that had all they needed of the worlds best and were engaged in doing work that counted
They had things worth while to be proud of and they had met him as a son and brother
With them he could for the only time in his life forget the lost hand that every day tortured him with a new pang
What kind of people were they and where did they belong among the classes he knew
He failed to decide because he never had known others similar to them but how he loved them
In the world where he was going soon were the majority like them or were they of the hypocrite and bunthrowing classes
He had forgotten the excitement of the morning and the passing of time when distant voices aroused him and he gently lifted his head
Nearer and nearer they came and as the heavy wagons rumbled down the east trail he could hear them plainly
The gang were shouting themselves hoarse for the Limberlost guard
Freckles did not feel that he deserved it
He would have given much to he able to go to the men and explain but to McLean only could he tell his story
At the sight of Freckles the men threw up their hats and cheered
McLean shook hands with him warmly but big Duncan gathered him into his arms and hugged him as a bear and choked over a few words of praise
The gang drove in and finished felling the tree
McLean was angry beyond measure at this attempt on his property for in their haste to fell the tree the thieves had cut too high and wasted a foot and a half of valuable timber
When the last wagon rolled away McLean sat on the stump and Freckles told the story he was aching to tell
The Boss scarcely could believe his senses
Also he was much disappointed
I have been almost praying all the way over Freckles he said that you would have some evidence by which we could arrest those fellows and get them out of our way but this will never do
We cant mix up those women in it
They have helped you save me the tree and my wager as well
Going across the country as she does the Bird Woman never could be expected to testify against them
No indeed nor the Angel either sir said Freckles
The Angel
queried the astonished McLean
The Boss listened in silence while Freckles told of the coming and christening of the Angel
I know her father well said McLean at last and I have often seen her
You are right she is a beautiful young girl and she appears to be utterly free from the least particle of false pride or foolishness
I do not understand why her father risks such a jewel in this place
Hes daring it because she is a jewel sir said Freckles eagerly
Why shes trusting a rattlesnake to rattle before it strikes her and of course she thinks she can trust mankind as well
The man isnt made who wouldnt lay down the life of him for her
She doesnt need any care
Her face and the pretty ways of her are all the protection she would need in a band of howling savages
Did you say she handled one of the revolvers
asked McLean
She scared all the breath out of me body admitted Freckles
Seems that her father has taught her to shoot
The Bird Woman told her distinctly to lie low and blaze away high just to help scare them
The spunky little thing followed them right out into the west road spitting lead like hail and clipping all around the heads and heels of them and Im damned sir if I believe shed cared a rap if shed hit
I never saw much shooting but if that wasnt the nearest to miss I ever want to see
Scared the life near out of me body with the fear that shed drop one of them
As long as Id no one to help me but a couple of women that didnt dare be mixed up in it all I could do was to let them get away
Now will they come back
asked McLean
Of course
said Freckles
Theyre not going to be taking that
You could stake your life on it theyll be coming back
At least Black Jack will
Wessner may not have the pluck unless he is half drunk
Then hed be a terror
And the next time Freckles hesitated
What
It will be a question of who shoots first and straightest
Then the only thing for me to do is to double the guard and bring the gang here the first minute possible
As soon as I feel that we have the rarest of the stuff out below we will come
The fact is in many cases until it is felled its difficult to tell what a tree will prove to be
It wont do to leave you here longer alone
Jack has been shooting twenty years to your one and it stands to reason that you are no match for him
Who of the gang would you like best to have with you
No one sir said Freckles emphatically
Next time is where I run
I wont try to fight them alone
Ill just be getting wind of them and then make tracks for you
Ill need to come like lightning and Duncan has no extra horse so Im thinking youd best get me oneor perhaps a wheel would be better
I used to do extra work for the Home doctor and he would let me take his bicycle to ride around the place
And at times the head nurse would loan me his for an hour
A wheel would cost less and be faster than a horse and would take less care
I believe if you are going to town soon you had best pick up any kind of an old one at some secondhand store for if Im ever called to use it in a hurry there wont be the handlebars left after crossing the corduroy
Yes said McLean and if you didnt have a firstclass wheel you never could cross the corduroy on it at all
As they walked to the cabin McLean insisted on another guard but Freckles was stubbornly set on fighting his battle alone
He made one mental condition
If the Bird Woman was going to give up the Little Chicken series he would yield to the second guard solely for the sake of her work and the presence of the Angel in the Limberlost
He did not propose to have a second man unless it were absolutely necessary for he had been alone so long that he loved the solitude his chickens and flowers
The thought of having a stranger to all his ways come and meddle with his arrangements frighten his pets pull his flowers and interrupt him when he wanted to study so annoyed him that he was blinded to his real need for help
With McLean it was a case of letting his sober better judgment be overridden by the boy he was growing so to love that he could not endure to oppose him and to have Freckles keep his trust and win alone meant more than any money the Boss might lose
The following morning McLean brought the wheel and Freckles took it to the trail to test it
It was new chainless with as little as possible to catch in hurried riding and in every way the best of its kind
Freckles went skimming around the trail on it on a preliminary trip before he locked it in his case and started his minute examination of his line on foot
He glanced around his room as he left it and then stood staring
On the moss before his prettiest seat lay the Angels hat
In the excitement of yesterday all of them had forgotten it
He went and picked it up oh
so carefully gazing at it with hungry eyes but touching it only to carry it to his case where he hung it on the shining handlebar of the new wheel and locked it among his treasures
Then he went to the trail with a new expression on his face and a strange throbbing in his heart
He was not in the least afraid of anything that morning
He felt he was the veriest Daniel but all his lions seemed weak and harmless
What Black Jacks next move would be he could not imagine but that there would be a move of some kind was certain
The big bully was not a man to give up his purpose or to have the hat swept from his head with a bullet and bear it meekly
Moreover Wessner would cling to his revenge with a Dutchmans singleness of mind
Freckles tried to think connectedly but there were too many places on the trail where the Angels footprints were vet visible
She had stepped in one mucky spot and left a sharp impression
The afternoon sun had baked it hard and the horses hoofs had not obliterated any part of it as they had in so many places
Freckles stood fascinated gazing at it
He measured it lovingly with his eye
He would not have ventured a caress on her hat any more than on her person but this was different
Surely a footprint on a trail might belong to anyone who found and wanted it
He stooped under the wires and entered the swamp
With a little searching he found a big piece of thick bark loose on a log and carefully peeling it carried it out and covered the print so that the first rain would not obliterate it
When he reached his room he tenderly laid the hat upon his bookshelf and to wear off his awkwardness mounted his wheel and went spinning on trail again
It was like flying for the path was worn smooth with his feet and baked hard with the sun almost all the way
When he came to the bark he veered far to one side and smiled at it in passing
Suddenly he was off the wheel kneeling beside it
He removed his hat carefully lifted the bark and gazed lovingly at the imprint
I wonder what she was going to say of me voice he whispered
She never got it said but from the face of her I believe she was liking it fairly well
Perhaps she was going to say that singing was the big thing I was to be doing
Thats what they all thought at the Home
Well if it is Ill just shut me eyes think of me little room the face of her watching and the heart of her beating and Ill raise them
Damn them if singing will do it Ill raise them from the benches
With this dire threat Freckles knelt as at a wayside spring and deliberately laid his lips on the footprint
Then he arose appearing as if he had been drinking at the fountain of gladness
CHAPTER VIII Wherein Freckles Meets a Man of Affairs and Loses Nothing by the Encounter Weel I be drawed on
exclaimed Mrs Duncan
Freckles stood before her holding the Angels hat
Ive been thinking this long time that ye or Duncan would see that sunbonnets werena braw enough for a woman of my standing and yere a guid laddie to bring me this beautiful hat
She turned it around examining the weave of the straw and the foliage trimmings passing her rough fingers over the satin ties delightedly
As she held it up admiring it Freckles astonished eyes saw a new side of Sarah Duncan
She was jesting but under the jest the fact loomed strong that though poor overworked and with none but Godgiven refinement there was something in her soul crying after that bit of feminine finery and it made his heart ache for her
He resolved that when he reached the city he would send her a hat if it took fifty dollars to do it
She lingeringly handed it back to him
Its unco guid of ye to think of me she said lightly but I maun question your taste a wee
Dye no think ye had best return this and get a woman with half her hair gray a little plainer headdress
Seems like thats far ower gay for me
Im no saying that its no exactly what Id like to hae but I mauna mak mysel ridiculous
Yed best give this to somebody young and pretty say about sixteen
Where did ye come by it Freckles
If theres anything been dropping lately ye hae forgotten to mention it
Do you see anything heavenly about that hat
queried Freckles holding it up
The morning breeze waved the ribbons gracefully binding one around Freckles sleeve and the other across his chest where they caught and clung as if magnetized
Yes said Sarah Duncan
Its verra plain and simple but it juist makes ye feel that its all of the finest stuff
Its exactly what Id call a heavenly hat
Sure said Freckles for its belonging to an Angel
Then he told her about the hat and asked her what he should do with it
Take it to her of course
said Sarah Duncan
Like its the only ane she has and she may need it badly
Freckles smiled
He had a clear idea about the hat being the only one the Angel had
However there was a thing he felt he should do and wanted to do but he was not sure
You think I might be taking it home
he said
Of course ye must said Mrs Duncan
And without another hours delay
Its been here two days noo and she may want it and be too busy or afraid to come
But how can I take it
asked Freckles
Gang spinning on your wheel
Ye can do it easy in an hour
But in that hour what if
Nonsense
interrupted Sarah Duncan
Yeve watched that timberline until yere grown fast to it lad
Give me your boots and club and Ill gae walk the south end and watch doon the east and west sides until ye come back
Mrs Duncan
You never would be doing it cried Freckles
Why not
inquired she
But you know youre mortal afraid of snakes and a lot of other things in the swamp
I am afraid of snakes said Mrs Duncan but likely theyve gone into the swamp this hot weather
Ill juist stay on the trail and watch and ye might hurry the least bit
The days so bright it feels like storm
I can put the bairns on the woodpile to play until I get back
Ye gang awa and take the blessed little angel her beautiful hat
Are you sure it will be all right
urged Freckles
Do you think if Mr McLean came he would care
Na said Mrs Duncan I dinna
If ye and me agree that a thing ought to be done and I watch in your place why its bound to be all right with McLean
Let me pin the hat in a paper and ye jump on your wheel and gang flying
Ought ye put on your Sabbathday clothes
Freckles shook his head
He knew what he should do but there was no use in taking time to try to explain it to Mrs Duncan while he was so hurried
He exchanged his wadingboots for shoes gave her his club and went spinning toward town
He knew very well where the Angel lived
He had seen her home many times and he passed it again without even raising his eyes from the street steering straight for her fathers place of business
Carrying the hat Freckles passed a long line of clerks and at the door of the private office asked to see the proprietor
When he had waited a moment a tall spare keeneyed man faced him and in brisk nervous tones asked How can I serve you sir
Freckles handed him the package and answered By delivering to your daughter this hat which she was after leaving at me place the other day when she went away in a hurry
And by saying to her and the Bird Woman that Im more thankful than Ill be having words to express for the brave things they was doing for me
Im McLeans Limberlost guard sir
Why dont you take it yourself
questioned the Man of Affairs
Freckles clear gray eyes met those of the Angels father squarely and he asked If you were in my place would you take it to her yourself
No I would not said that gentleman quickly
Then why ask why I did not
came Freckles lamblike query
Bless me
said the Angels father
He stared at the package then at the lifted chin of the boy and then at the package again and muttered Excuse me
Freckles bowed
It would be favoring me greatly if you would deliver the hat and the message
Good morning sir and he turned away
One minute said the Angels father
Suppose I give you permission to return this hat in person and make your own acknowledgments
Freckles stood one moment thinking intently and then he lifted those eyes of unswerving truth and asked Why should you sir
You are kind indade to mention it and its thanking you I am for your good intintions but my wanting to go or your being willing to have me aint proving that your daughter would be wanting me or care to bother with me
The Angels father looked keenly into the face of this extraordinary young man for he found it to his liking
Theres one other thing I meant to say said Freckles
Every day I see something and at times a lot of things that I think the Bird Woman would be wanting pictures of badly if she knew
You might be speaking of it to her and if shed want me to I can send her word when I find things she wouldnt likely get elsewhere
If thats the case said the Angels father and you feel under obligations for her assistance the other day you can discharge them in that way
She is spending all her time in the fields and woods searching for subjects
If you run across things perhaps rarer than she may find about your work it would save her the time she spends searching for subjects and she could work in security under your protection
By all means let her know if you find subjects you think she could use and we will do anything we can for you if you will give her what help you can and see that she is as safe as possible
Its hungry for human beings I am said Freckles and its like Heaven to me to have them come
Of course Ill be telling or sending her word every time me work can spare me
Anything I can do it would make me uncommon happy butagain truth had to be told because it was Freckles who was speakingwhen it comes to protecting them Id risk me life to be sure but even that mightnt do any good in some cases
There are many dangers to be reckoned with in the swamp sir that call for every person to look sharp
If there wasnt really thieving to guard against why McLean wouldnt need be paying out good money for a guard
Id love them to be coming and Ill do all I can but you must be told that theres danger of them running into timber thieves again any day sir
Yes said the Angels father and I suppose theres danger of the earth opening up and swallowing the town any day but Im damned if I quit business for fear it will and the Bird Woman wont either
Everyone knows her and her work and there is no danger in the world of anyone in any way molesting her even if he were stealing a few of McLeans goldplated trees
Shes as safe in the Limberlost as she is at home so far as timber thieves are concerned
All I am ever uneasy about are the snakes poison vines and insects and those are risks she must run anywhere
You need not hesitate a minute about that
I shall be glad to tell them what you wish
Thank you very much and good day sir
There was no way in which Freckles could know it but by following his best instincts and being what he conceived a gentleman should be he surprised the Man of Affairs into thinking of him and seeing his face over his books many times that morning whereas if he had gone to the Angel as he had longed to do her father never would have given him a second thought
On the street he drew a deep breath
How had he acquitted himself
He only knew that he had lived up to his best impulse and that is all anyone can do
He glanced over his wheel to see that it was all right and just as he stepped to the curb to mount he heard a voice that thrilled him through and through Freckles
Oh Freckles
The Angel separated from a group of laughing sweetfaced girls and came hurrying to him
She was in snowy whitea quaint little frock with a marvel of soft lace around her throat and wrists
Through the sheer sleeves of it her beautiful rounded arms showed distinctly and it was cut just to the base of her perfect neck
On her head was a pure white creation of fancy braid with folds on folds of tulle soft and silken as cobwebs lining the brim while a mass of white roses clustered against the gold of her hair crept around the crown and fell in a riot to her shoulders at the back
There were gleams of gold with settings of blue on her fingers and altogether she was the daintiest sweetest sight he ever had seen
Freckles standing on the curb forgot himself in his cotton shirt corduroys and his belt to which his wirecutter and pliers were hanging and gazed as a man gazes when first he sees the woman he adores with all her charms enhanced by appropriate and beautiful clothing
Oh Freckles she cried as she came to him
I was wondering about you the other day
Do you know I never saw you in town before
You watch that old line so closely
Why did you come
Is there any trouble
Are you just starting to the Limberlost
I came to bring your hat said Freckles
You forgot it in the rush the other day
I have left it with your father and a message trying to ixpriss the gratitude of me for how you and the Bird Woman were for helping me out
The Angel nodded gravely then Freckles saw that he had done the proper thing in going to her father
His heart bounded until it jarred his body for she was saying that she scarcely could wait for the time to come for the next picture of the Little Chicken series
I want to hear the remainder of that song and I hadnt even begun seeing your room yet she complained
As for singing if you can sing like that every day I never can get enough of it
I wonder if I couldnt bring my banjo and some of the songs I like best
Ill play and you sing and well put the birds out of commission
Freckles stood on the curb with drooped eyes for he felt that if he lifted them the tumult of tender adoration in them would show and frighten her
I was afraid your ixperience the other day would scare you so that youd never be coming again he found himself saying
The Angel laughed gaily
Did I seem scared
she questioned
No said Freckles you did not
Oh I just enjoyed that she cried
Those hateful stealing old things
I had a big notion to pink one of them but I thought maybe someway it would be best for you that I shouldnt
They needed it
That didnt scare me and as for the Bird Woman shes accustomed to finding snakes tramps cross dogs sheep cattle and goodness knows what
You cant frighten her when shes after a picture
Did they come back
No said Freckles
The gang got there a little after noon and took out the tree but I must tell you and you must tell the Bird Woman that theres no doubt but they will be coming back and they will have to make it before long now for its soon the gang will be there to work on the swamp
Oh what a shame
cried the Angel
Theyll clear out roads cut down the beautiful trees and tear up everything
Theyll drive away the birds and spoil the cathedral
When they have done their worst then all these mills close here will follow in and take out the cheap timber
Then the landowners will dig a few ditches build some fires and in two summers more the Limberlost will be in corn and potatoes
They looked at each other and groaned despairingly in unison
You like it too said Freckles
Yes said the Angel I love it
Your room is a little piece right out of the heart of fairyland and the cathedral is Gods work not yours
You only found it and opened the door after He had it completed
The birds flowers and vines are all so lovely
The Bird Woman says it is really a fact that the mallows foxfire iris and lilies are larger and of richer coloring there than in the remainder of the country
She says its because of the rich loam and muck
I hate seeing the swamp torn up and to you it will be like losing your best friend wont it
Something like said Freckles
Still Ive the Limberlost in me heart so that all of it will be real to me while I live no matter what they do to it
Im glad past telling if you will be coming a few more times at least until the gang arrives
Past that time I dont allow mesilf to be thinking
Come have a cool drink before you start back said the Angel
I couldnt possibly said Freckles
I left Mrs Duncan on the trail and shes terribly afraid of a lot of things
If she even sees a big snake I dont know what shell do
It wont take but a minute and you can ride fast enough to make up for it
Please
I want to think of something fine for you to make up a little for what you did for me that first day
Freckles looked in sheer wonderment into the beautiful face of the Angel
Did she truly mean it
Would she walk down that street with him crippled homely in mean clothing with the tools of his occupation on him and share with him the treat she was offering
He could not believe it even of the Angel
Still in justice to the candor of her pure sweet face he would not think that she would make the offer and not mean it
She really did mean just what she said but when it came to carrying out her offer and he saw the stares of her friends the sneers of her enemiesif such as she could have enemiesand heard the whispered jeers of the curious then she would see her mistake and be sorry
It would be only a manly thing for him to think this out and save her from the results of her own blessed bigness of heart
I railly must be off said Freckles earnestly but Im thanking you more than youll ever know for your kindness
Ill just be drinking bowls of icy things all me way home in the thoughts of it
Down came the Angels foot
Her eyes flashed indignantly
Theres no sense in that she said
How do you think you would have felt when you knew I was warm and thirsty and you went and brought me a drink and I wouldnt take it becausebecause goodness knows why
You can ride faster to make up for the time
Ive just thought out what I want to fix for you
She stepped to his side and deliberately slipped her hand under his armthat right arm that ended in an empty sleeve
You are coming she said firmly
I wont have it
Freckles could not have told how he felt neither could anyone else
His blood rioted and his head swam but he kept his wits
He bent over her
Please dont Angel he said softly
You dont understand
How Freckles came to understand was a problem
Its this he persisted
If your father met me on the street in my station and dress with you on me arm hed have every right to be caning me before the people and not a finger would I lift to stay him
The Angels eyes snapped
If you think my father cares about my doing anything that is right and kind and that makes me happy to dowhy then you completely failed in reading my father and Ill ask him and just show you
She dropped Freckles arm and turned toward the entrance to the building
Why look there
she exclaimed
Her father stood in a big window fronting the street a bundle of papers in his hand interestedly watching the little scene with eyes that comprehended quite as thoroughly as if he had heard every word
The Angel caught his glance and made a despairing little gesture toward Freckles
The Man of Affairs answered her with a look of infinite tenderness
He nodded his head and waved the papers in the direction she had indicated and the veriest dolt could have read the words his lips formed Take him along
A sudden trembling seized Freckles
At sight of the Angels father he had stepped back as far from her as he could leaned the wheel against him and snatched off his hat
The Angel turned on him with triumphing eyes
She was highly strung and not accustomed to being thwarted
Did You see that
she demanded
Now are you satisfied
Will you come or must I call a policeman to bring you
Freckles went
There was nothing else to do
Guiding his wheel he walked down the street beside her
On every hand she was kept busy giving and receiving the cheeriest greetings
She walked into the parlors exactly as if she owned them
A clerk came hurrying to meet her
Theres a table vacant beside a window where it is cool
Ill save it for you and he started back
Please not said the Angel
Ive taken this man unawares when hes in a rush
Im afraid if we sit down well take too much time and afterward he will blame me
She walked to the fountain and a long row of people stared with all the varying degrees of insolence and curiosity that Freckles had felt they would
He glanced at the Angel
NOW would she see
On my soul
he muttered under his breath
They dont aven touch her
She laid down her sunshade and gloves
She walked to the end of the counter and turned the full battery of her eyes on the attendant
Please she said
The whiteaproned individual stepped back and gave delighted assent
The Angel stepped beside him and selecting a tall flaring glass of almost paper thinness she stooped and rolled it in a tray of cracked ice
I want to mix a drink for my friend she said
He has a long hot ride before him and I dont want him started off with one of those old palateteasing sweetnesses that you mix just on purpose to drive a man back in ten minutes
There was an appreciative laugh from the line at the counter
I want a clear cool sparkling drink that has a tang of acid in it
Wheres the cherry phosphate
That not at all sweet would be good dont you think
The attendant did think
He pointed out the different taps and the Angel compounded the drink while Freckles standing so erect he almost leaned backward gazed at her and paid no attention to anyone else
When she had the glass brimming she tilted a little of its contents into a second glass and tasted it
Thats entirely too sweet for a thirsty man she said
She poured out half the mixture and refilling the glass tasted it a second time
She submitted that result to the attendant
Isnt that about the thing
she asked
He replied enthusiastically
Id get my wages raised ten a month if I could learn that trick
The Angel carried the brimming frosty glass to Freckles
He removed his hat and lifting the icy liquid even with her eyes and looking straight into them he said in the mellowest of all the mellow tones of his voice Ill be drinking it to the Swamp Angel
As he had said to her that first day she now cautioned him Be drinking slowly
When the screendoor swung behind them one of the men at the counter asked of the attendant Now what did that mean
Exactly what you saw replied he rather curtly
Were accustomed to it here
Hardly a day passes this hot weather but shes picking up some poor godforsaken mortal and bringing him in
Then she comes behind the counter herself and fixes up a drink to suit the occasion
Shes all sorts of fancies about whats what for all kinds of times and conditions and you bet she can just hit the spot
Aint a clerk here can put up a drink to touch her
Shes a sort of knack at it
Every once in a while when the Boss sees her he calls out to her to mix him a drink
And does she
asked the man with an interested grin
Well I guess
But first she goes back and sees how long it is since hes had a drink
What he drank last
How warm he is
When he ate last
Then she comes here and mixes a glass of fizz with a little touch of acid and a bit of cherry lemon grape pineapple or something sour and cooling and it hits the spot just as no spot was ever hit before
I honestly believe that the INTEREST she takes in it is half the trick for I watch her closely and I cant come within gunshot of her concoctions
She has a running bill here
Her father settles once a month
She gives ninetenths of it away
Hardly ever touches it herself but when she does she makes me mix it
Shes just old persimmons
Even the scrubboy of this establishment would fight for her
It lasts the year round for in winter its some poor frozen cuss that shes warming up on hot coffee or chocolate
Mighty queer specimen she had this time volunteered another
Irish hand off straight as a ramrod and something worth while in his face
Notice that hat peel off and the eyes of him
Theres a case of fight for her
Wonder who he is
I think said a third that hes McLeans Limberlost guard and I suspect shes gone to the swamp with the Bird Woman for pictures and knows him that way
Ive heard that he is a master hand with the birds and that would just suit the Bird Woman to a T On the street the Angel walked beside Freckles to the first crossing and there she stopped
Now will you promise to ride fast enough to make up for the five minutes that took
she asked
I am a little uneasy about Mrs
Duncan
Freckles turned his wheel into the street
It seemed to him he had poured that delicious icy liquid into every vein in his body instead of his stomach
It even went to his brain
Did you insist on fixing that drink because you knew how intoxicating twould be
he asked
There was subtlety in the compliment and it delighted the Angel
She laughed gleefully
Next time maybe you wont take so much coaxing she teased
I wouldnt this if I had known your father and been understanding you better
Do you really think the Bird Woman will be coming again
The Angel jeered
Wild horses couldnt drag her away she cried
She will have hard work to wait the week out
I shouldnt be in the least surprised to see her start any hour
Freckles could not endure the suspense it had to come
And you
he questioned but he dared not lift his eyes
Wild horses me too she laughed couldnt keep me away either
I dearly love to come and the next time I am going to bring my banjo and Ill play and you sing for me some of the songs I like best wont you
Yis said Freckles because it was all he was capable of saying just then
Its beginning to act stormy she said
If you hurry you will just about make it
Now goodbye
CHAPTER IX Wherein the Limberlost Falls upon Mrs Duncan and Freckles Comes to the Rescue Freckles was halfway to the Limberlost when he dismounted
He could ride no farther because he could not see the road
He sat under a tree and leaning against it sobs shook twisted and rent him
If they would remind him of his position speak condescendingly or notice his hand he could endure it but thisit surely would kill him
His hot pulsing Irish blood was stirred deeply
What did they mean
Why did they do it
Were they like that to everyone
Was it pity
It could not be for he knew that the Bird Woman and the Angels father must know that he was not really McLeans son and it did not matter to them in the least
In spite of accident and poverty they evidently expected him to do something worth while in the world
That must be his remedy
He must work on his education
He must get away
He must find and do the great thing of which the Angel talked
For the first time his thoughts turned anxiously toward the city and the beginning of his studies
McLean and the Duncans spoke of him as the boy but he was a man
He must face life bravely and act a mans part
The Angel was a mere child
He must not allow her to torture him past endurance with her frank comradeship that meant to him high heaven earths richness and all that lay between and NOTHING to her
There was an ominous growl of thunder and amazed at himself Freckles snatched up his wheel and raced toward the swamp
He was worried to find his boots lying at the cabin door the children playing on the woodpile told him that mither said they were so heavy she couldnt walk in them and she had come back and taken them off
Thoroughly frightened he stopped only long enough to slip them on and then sped with all his strength for the Limberlost
To the west the long black hardbeaten trail lay clear but far up the east side straight across the path he could see what was certainly a limp brown figure
Freckles spun with all his might
Face down Sarah Duncan lay across the trail
When Freckles turned her over his blood chilled at the look of horror settled on her face
There was a low humming and something spatted against him
Glancing around Freckles shivered in terror for there was a swarm of wild bees settled on a scrubthorn only a few yards away
The air was filled with excited unsettled bees making ready to lead farther in search of a suitable location
Then he thought he understood and with a prayer of thankfulness in his heart that she had escaped even so narrowly he caught her up and hurried down the trail until they were well out of danger
He laid her in the shade and carrying water from the swamp in the crown of his hat he bathed her face and hands but she lay in unbroken stillness without a sign of life
She had found Freckles boots so large and heavy that she had gone back and taken them off although she was mortally afraid to approach the swamp without them
The thought of it made her nervous and the fact that she never had been there alone added to her fears
She had not followed the trail many rods when her trouble began
She was not Freckles so not a bird of the line was going to be fooled into thinking she was
They began jumping from their nests and darting from unexpected places around her head and feet with quick whirs that kept her starting and dodging
Before Freckles was halfway to the town poor Mrs Duncan was hysterical and the Limberlost had neither sung nor performed for her
But there was trouble brewing
It was quiet and intensely hot with that stifling stillness that precedes a summer storm and feathers and fur were tense and nervous
The birds were singing only a few broken snatches and flying around seeking places of shelter
One moment everything seemed devoid of life the next there was an unexpected whir buzz and sharp cry
Inside a pandemonium of growling spatting snarling and grunting broke loose
The swale bent flat before heavy gusts of wind and the big black chicken swept lower and lower above the swamp
Patches of clouds gathered shutting out the sun and making it very dark and the next moment were swept away
The sun poured with fierce burning brightness and everything was quiet
It was at the first growl of thunder that Freckles really had noticed the weather and putting his own troubles aside resolutely raced for the swamp
Sarah Duncan paused on the line
Weel I wouldna stay in this place for a million a month she said aloud and the sound of her voice brought no comfort for it was so little like she had thought it that she glanced hastily around to see if it had really been she that spoke
She tremblingly wiped the perspiration from her face with the skirt of her sunbonnet
Awfu hot she panted huskily
Blieve theres going to be a big storm
I do hope Freckles will hurry
Her chin was quivering as a terrified childs
She lifted her bonnet to replace it and brushed against a bush beside her
WHIRR almost into her face went a nighthawk stretched along a limb for its daytime nap
Mrs Duncan cried out and sprang down the trail alighting on a frog that was hopping across
The horrible croak it gave as she crushed it sickened her
She screamed wildly and jumped to one side
That carried her into the swale where the grasses reached almost to her waist and her horror of snakes returning she made a flying leap for an old log lying beside the line
She alighted squarely but it was so damp and rotten that she sank straight through it to her knees
She caught at the wire as she went down and missing raked her wrist across a barb until she tore a bleeding gash
Her fingers closed convulsively around the second strand
She was too frightened to scream now
Her tongue stiffened
She clung frantically to the sagging wire and finally managed to grasp it with the other hand
Then she could reach the top wire and so she drew herself up and found solid footing
She picked up the club that she had dropped in order to extricate herself
Leaning heavily on it she managed to return to the trail but she was trembling so that she scarcely could walk
Going a few steps farther she came to the stump of the first tree that had been taken out
She sat bolt upright and very still trying to collect her thoughts and reason away her terror
A squirrel above her dropped a nut and as it came rattling down bouncing from branch to branch every nerve in her tugged wildly
When the disgusted squirrel barked loudly she sprang to the trail
The wind arose higher the changes from light to darkness were more abrupt while the thunder came closer and louder at every peal
In swarms the blackbirds arose from the swale and came flocking to the interior with a clamoring cry TCHECK TCHECK
Grackles marshaled to the tribal call TRALLAHEE TRALLAHEE
Redwinged blackbirds swept low calling to belated mates FOLLOWME FOLLOWME
Big jetty crows gathered close to her crying as if warning her to flee before it was everlastingly too late
A heron fishing the nearby pool for Freckles findout frog fell into trouble with a muskrat and uttered a rasping note that sent Mrs Duncan a rod down the line without realizing that she had moved
She was too shaken to run far
She stopped and looked around her fearfully
Several bees struck her and were angrily buzzing before she noticed them
Then the humming swelled on all sides
A convulsive sob shook her and she ran into the bushes now into the swale anywhere to avoid the swarming bees ducking dodging fighting for her very life
Presently the humming seemed to become a little fainter
She found the trail again and ran with all her might from a few of her angry pursuers
As she ran straining every muscle she suddenly became aware that crossing the trail before her was a big round black body with brown markings on its back like painted geometrical patterns
She tried to stop but the louder buzzing behind warned her she dared not
Gathering her skirts higher with hair flying around her face and her eyes almost bursting from their sockets she ran straight toward it
The sound of her feet and the humming of the bees alarmed the rattler so it stopped across the trail lifting its head above the grasses of the swale and rattling inquiringlyrattled until the bees were outdone
Straight toward it went the panicstricken woman running wildly and uncontrollably
She took one leap clearing its body on the path then flew ahead with winged feet
The snake coiled to strike missed Mrs Duncan and landed among the bees instead
They settled over and around it and realizing that it had found trouble it sank among the grasses and went threshing toward its den in the deep willowfringed low ground
The swale appeared as if a reaper were cutting a wide swath
The mass of enraged bees darted angrily around searching for it and striking the scrubthorn began a temporary settling there to discover whether it were a suitable place
Completely exhausted Mrs Duncan staggered on a few steps farther fell facing the path where Freckles found her and lay quietly
Freckles worked over her until she drew a long quivering breath and opened her eyes
When she saw him bending above her she closed them tightly and gripping him struggled to her feet
He helped her and with his arm around and half carrying her they made their way to the clearing
She clung to him with all her remaining strength but open her eyes she would not until her children came clustering around her
Then brawny big Scotswoman though she was she quietly keeled over again
The children added their wailing to Freckles panic
This time he was so close the cabin that he could carry her into the house and lay her on the bed
He sent the oldest boy scudding down the corduroy for the nearest neighbor and between them they undressed Mrs Duncan and discovered that she was not bitten
They bathed and bound the bleeding wrist and coaxed her back to consciousness
She lay sobbing and shuddering
The first intelligent word she said was Freckles look at that jar on the kitchen table and see if my yeast is no running ower
Several days passed before she could give Duncan and Freckles any detailed account of what had happened to her even then she could not do it without crying as the least of her babies
Freckles was almost heartbroken and nursed her as well as any woman could have done while big Duncan with a heart full for them both worked early and late to chink every crack of the cabin and examine every spot that possibly could harbor a snake
The effects of her morning on the trail kept her shivering half the time
She could not rest until she sent for McLean and begged him to save Freckles from further risk in that place of horrors
The Boss went to the swamp with his mind fully determined to do so
Freckles stood and laughed at him
Why Mr McLean dont you let a womans nervous system set you worrying about me he said
Im not denying how she felt because Ive been through it meself but thats all over and gone
Its the height of me glory to fight it out with the old swamp and all thats in it or will be coming to it and then to turn it over to you as I promised you and meself Id do sir
You couldnt break the heart of me entire quicker than to be taking it from me now when Im just on the homestretch
It wont be over three or four weeks yet and when Ive gone it almost a year why whats that to me sir
You mustnt let a woman get mixed up with business for Ive always heard about how its bringing trouble
McLean smiled
What about that last tree
he said
Freckles blushed and grinned appreciatively
Angels and Bird Women dont count in the common run sir he affirmed shamelessly
McLean sat in the saddle and laughed
CHAPTER X Wherein Freckles Strives Mightily and the Swamp Angel Rewards Him The Bird Woman and the Angel did not seem to count in the common run for they arrived on time for the third of the series and found McLean on the line talking to Freckles
The Boss was filled with enthusiasm over a marsh article of the Bird Womans that he just had read
He begged to be allowed to accompany her into the swamp and watch the method by which she secured an illustration in such a location
The Bird Woman explained to him that it was an easy matter with the subject she then had in hand and as Little Chicken was too small to be frightened by him and big enough to be growing troublesome she was glad for his company
They went to the chicken log together leaving to the happy Freckles the care of the Angel who had brought her banjo and a roll of songs that she wanted to hear him sing
The Bird Woman told them that they might practice in Freckles room until she finished with Little Chicken and then she and McLean would come to the concert
It was almost three hours before they finished and came down the west trail for their rest and lunch
McLean walked ahead keeping sharp watch on the trail and clearing it of fallen limbs from overhanging trees
He sent a big piece of bark flying into the swale and then stopped short and stared at the trail
The Bird Woman bent forward
Together they studied that imprint of the Angels foot
At last their eyes met the Bird Womans filled with astonishment and McLeans humid with pity
Neither said a word but they knew
McLean entered the swale and hunted up the bark
He replaced it and the Bird Woman carefully stepped over
As they reached the bushes at the entrance the voice of the Angel stopped them for it was commanding and filled with much impatience
Freckles James Ross McLean
she was saying
You fill me with darkblue despair
Youre singing as if your voice were glass and might break at any minute
Why dont you sing as you did a week ago
Answer me that please
Freckles smiled confusedly at the Angel who sat on one of his fancy seats playing his accompaniment on her banjo
You are a fraud she said
Here you went last week and led me to think that there was the making of a great singer in you and now you are singingdo you know how badly you are singing
Yis said Freckles meekly
Im thinking Im too happy to be singing well today
The music dont come right only when Im lonesome and sad
The worlds for being all sunshine at prisint for among you and Mr McLean and the Bird Woman Im after being THAT happy that I cant keep me thoughts on me notes
Its more than sorry I am to be disappointing you
Play it over and Ill be beginning again and this time Ill hold hard
Well said the Angel disgustedly it seems to me that if I had all the things to be proud of that you have Id lift up my head and sing
And what is it Ive to be proud of maam
politely inquired Freckles
Why a whole worldful of things cried the Angel explosively
For one thing you can be good and proud over the way youve kept the timber thieves out of this lease and the trust your father has in you
You can be proud that youve never even once disappointed him or failed in what he believed you could do
You can be proud over the way everyone speaks of you with trust and honor and about how brave of heart and strong of body you are I heard a big man say a few days ago that the Limberlost was full of disagreeable thingspositive dangers unhealthful as it could be and that since the memory of the first settlers it has been a rendezvous for runaways thieves and murderers
This swamp is named for a man that was lost here and wandered around til he starved
That man I was talking with said he wouldnt take your job for a thousand dollars a monthin fact he said he wouldnt have it for any money and youve never missed a day or lost a tree
Proud
Why I should think you would just parade around about proper over that
And you can always be proud that you are born an Irishman
My father is Irish and if you want to see him get up and strut give him a teeny opening to enlarge on his race
He says that if the Irish had decent territory theyd lead the world
He says theyve always been handicapped by lack of space and of fertile soil
He says if Ireland had been as big and fertile as Indiana why England wouldnt ever have had the upper hand
Shed only be an appendage
Fancy England an appendage
He says Ireland has the finest orators and the keenest statesmen in Europe today and when England wants to fight with whom does she fill her trenches
Irishmen of course
Ireland has the greenest grass and trees the finest stones and lakes and theyve jauntingcars
I dont know just exactly what they are but Ireland has all there are anyway
Theyve a lot of great actors and a few singers and there never was a sweeter poet than one of theirs
You should hear my father recite Dear Harp of My Country
He does it this way
The Angel arose made an elaborate oldtime bow and holding up the banjo recited in clipping feet and meter with rhythmic swing and a touch of brogue that was simply irresistible Dear harp of my country The Angel ardently clasped the banjo In darkness I found thee She held it to the light The cold chain of silence had hung oer thee long She muted the strings with her rosy palm Then proudly my own Irish harp I unbound thee She threw up her head and swept a ringing harmony And gave all thy chords to light freedom and song She crashed into the notes of the accompaniment she had been playing for Freckles
Thats what you want to be thinking of
she cried
Not darkness and lonesomeness and sadness but light freedom and song
I cant begin to think offhand of all the big splendid things an Irishman has to be proud of but whatever they are they are all yours and you are a part of them
I just despise that saddest whenIsing business
You can sing
Now you go over there and do it
Ireland has had her statesmen warriors actors and poets now you be her voice
You stand right out there before the cathedral door and Im going to come down the aisle playing that accompaniment and when I stop in front of youyou sing
The Angels face wore an unusual flush
Her eyes were flashing and she was palpitating with earnestness
She parted the bushes and disappeared
Freckles straight and tense stood waiting
Presently before he saw she was there she was coming down the aisle toward him playing compellingly and rifts of light were touching her with golden glory
Freckles stood as if transfixed
The cathedral was majestically beautiful from arched dome of frescoed gold green and blue in neverending shades and harmonies to the mosaic aisle she trod richly inlaid in choicest colors and gigantic pillars that were Gods handiwork fashioned and perfected through ages of sunshine and rain
But the fair young face and divinely molded form of the Angel were His most perfect work of all
Never had she appeared so surpassingly beautiful
She was smiling encouragingly now and as she came toward him she struck the chords full and strong
The heart of poor Freckles almost burst with dull pain and his great love for her
In his desire to fulfill her expectations he forgot everything else and when she reached his initial chord he was ready
He literally burst forth Three little leaves of Irish green United on one stem Love truth and valor do they mean They form a magic gem
The Angels eyes widened curiously and her lips parted
A deep color swept into her cheeks
She had intended to arouse him
She had more than succeeded
She was too young to know that in the effort to rouse a man women frequently kindle fires that they neither can quench nor control
Freckles was looking over her head now and singing that song as it never had been sung before for her alone and instead of her helping him as she had intended he was carrying her with him on the waves of his voice away away into another world
When he struck into the chorus wideeyed and panting she was swaying toward him and playing with all her might
Oh do you love
Oh say you love You love the shamrock green
At the last note Freckles voice ceased and he looked at the Angel
He had given his best and his all
He fell on his knees and folded his arms across his breast
The Angel as if magnetized walked straight down the aisle to him and running her fingers into the crisp masses of his red hair tilted his head back and laid her lips on his forehead
Then she stepped back and faced him
Good boy
she said in a voice that wavered from the throbbing of her shaken heart
Dear boy
I knew you could do it
I knew it was in you
Freckles when you go into the world if you can face a big audience and sing like that just once you will be immortal and anything you want will be yours
Anything
gasped Freckles
Anything said the Angel
Freckles arose muttered something and catching up his old bucket plunged into the swamp blindly on a pretence of bringing water
The Angel walked slowly across the study sat on the rustic bench and through narrowed lids intently studied the tip of her shoe
On the trail the Bird Woman wheeled to McLean with a dumbfounded look
God
muttered he
At last the Bird Woman spoke
Do you think the Angel knew she did that
she asked softly
No said McLean I do not
But the poor boy knew it
Heaven help him
The Bird Woman stared across the gently waving swale
I dont see how I am going to blame her she said at last
Its so exactly what I would have done myself
Say the remainder demanded McLean hoarsely
Do him justice
He was born a gentleman conceded the Bird Woman
He took no advantage
He never even offered to touch her
Whatever that kiss meant to him he recognized that it was the loving impulse of a child under stress of strong emotion
He was fine and manly as any man ever could have been
McLean lifted his hat
Thank you he said simply and parted the bushes for her to enter Freckles room
It was her first visit
Before she left she sent for her cameras and made studies of each side of it and of the cathedral
She was entranced with the delicate beauty of the place while her eyes kept following Freckles as if she could not believe that it could be his conception and work
That was a happy day
The Bird Woman had brought a lunch and they spread it with Freckles dinner on the study floor and sat resting and enjoying themselves
But the Angel put her banjo into its case silently gathered her music and no one mentioned the concert
The Bird Woman left McLean and the Angel to clear away the lunch and with Freckles examined the walls of his room and told him all she knew about his shrubs and flowers
She analyzed a cardinalflower and showed him what he had wanted to know all summerwhy the bees buzzed ineffectually around it while the hummingbirds found in it an everready feast
Some of his specimens were so rare that she was unfamiliar with them and with the flower book between them they knelt studying the different varieties
She wandered the length of the cathedral aisle with him and it was at her suggestion that he lighted his altar with a row of flaming foxfire
As Freckles came to the cabin from his long day at the swamp he saw Mrs Chicken sweeping to the south and wondered where she was going
He stepped into the bright cosy little kitchen and as he reached down the washbasin he asked Mrs Duncan a question
Mother Duncan do kisses wash off
So warm a wave swept her heart that a halfflush mantled her face
She straightened her shoulders and glanced at her hands tenderly
Lord na
Freckles she cried
At least the anes ye get from people ye love dinna
They dinna stay on the outside
They strike in until they find the center of your heart and make their stoppingplace there and naething can take them from yeI doubt if even deathNa lad ye can be reet sure kisses dinna wash off
Freckles set the basin down and muttered as he plunged his hot tired face into the water I neednt be afraid to be washing then for that one struck in
CHAPTER XI Wherein the Butterflies Go on a Spree and Freckles Informs the Bird Woman I wish said Freckles at breakfast one morning that I had some way to be sending a message to the Bird Woman
Ive something at the swamp that Im believing never happened before and surely shell be wanting it
What now Freckles
asked Mrs Duncan
Why the oddest thing you ever heard of said Freckles the whole insect tribe gone on a spree
Im supposing its my doings but it all happened by accident like
You see on the swale side of the line right against me trail theres one of these scrub wild crabtrees
Where the grass grows thick around it is the finest place you ever conceived of for snakes
Having women about has set me trying to clean out those fellows a bit and yesterday I noticed that tree in passing
It struck me that it would be a good idea to be taking it out
First I thought Id take me hatchet and cut it down for it aint thicker than me upper arm
Then I remembered how it was blooming in the spring and filling all the air with sweetness
The coloring of the blossoms is beautiful and I hated to be killing it
I just cut the grass short all around it
Then I started at the ground trimmed up the trunk near the height of me shoulder and left the top spreading
That made it look so truly ornamental that idle like I chips off the rough places neat and this morning on me soul its a sight
You see cutting off the limbs and trimming up the trunk sets the sap running
In this hot sun it ferments in a few hours
There isnt much room for more things to crowd on that tree than there are and to get drunker isnt noways possible
Weel I be drawed on
exclaimed Mrs Duncan
What kind of things do ye mean Freckles
Why just an army of black ants
Some of them are sucking away like old topers
Some of them are setting up on their tails and hind legs fiddling with their forefeet and wiping their eyes
Some are rolling around on the ground contented
There are quantities of big bluebottle flies over the bark and hanging on the grasses around too drunk to steer a course flying so they just buzz away like flying and all the time sitting still
The snakefeeders are too full to feed anythingeven more sap to themselves
Theres a lot of hardbacked bugsbeetles I guesscolored like the brown blue and black of a peacocks tail
They hang on until the legs of them are so wake they cant stick a minute longer and then they break away and fall to the ground
They just lay there on their backs fably clawing air
When it wears off a bit up they get and go crawling back for more and they so full they bump into each other and roll over
Sometimes they cant climb the tree until they wait to sober up a little
Theres a lot of big blackandgold bumblebees done for entire stumbling over the bark and rolling on the ground
They just lay there on their backs rocking from side to side singing to themselves like fat happy babies
The wild bees keep up a steady buzzing with the beating of their wings
The butterflies are the worst old topers of them all
Theyre just a circus
You never saw the like of the beauties
They come every color you could be naming and every shape you could be thinking up
They drink and drink until if Im driving them away they stagger as they fly and turn somersaults in the air
If I lave them alone they cling to the grasses shivering happy like and Im blest Mother Duncan if the best of them could be unlocking the front door with a lead pencil even
I never heard of anything sae surprising said Mrs Duncan
Its a rare sight to watch them and no one ever made a picture of a thing like that before Im for thinking said Freckles earnestly
Na said Mrs Duncan
Ye can be pretty sure there didna
The Bird Woman must have word in some way if ye walk the line and I walk to town and tell her
If ye think ye can wait until after supper I am most sure ye can gang yoursel for Duncan is coming home and hed be glad to watch for ye
If he does na come and na ane passes that I can send word with today I really will gang early in the morning and tell her mysel
Freckles took his lunch and went to the swamp
He walked and watched eagerly
He could find no trace of anything yet he felt a tense nervousness as if trouble might be brooding
He examined every section of the wire and kept watchful eyes on the grasses of the swale in an effort to discover if anyone had passed through them but he could discover no trace of anything to justify his fears
He tilted his hat brim to shade his face and looked for his chickens
They were hanging almost beyond sight in the sky
Gee
he said
If I only had your sharp eyes and convenient location now I wouldnt need be troubling so
He reached his room and cautiously scanned the entrance before he stepped in
Then he pushed the bushes apart with his right arm and entered his left hand on the butt of his favorite revolver
Instantly he knew that someone had been there
He stepped to the center of the room closely scanning each wall and the floor
He could find no trace of a clue to confirm his belief yet so intimate was he with the spirit of the place that he knew
How he knew he could not have told yet he did know that someone had entered his room sat on his benches and walked over his floor
He was surest around the case
Nothing was disturbed yet it seemed to Freckles that he could see where prying fingers had tried the lock
He stepped behind the case carefully examining the ground all around it and close beside the tree to which it was nailed he found a deep fresh footprint in the spongy soila long narrow print that was never made by the foot of Wessner
His heart tugged in his breast as he mentally measured the print but he did not linger for now the feeling arose that he was being watched
It seemed to him that he could feel the eyes of some intruder at his back
He knew he was examining things too closely if anyone were watching he did not want him to know that he felt it
He took the most open way and carried water for his flowers and moss as usual but he put himself into no position in which he was fully exposed and his hand was close his revolver constantly
Growing restive at last under the strain he plunged boldly into the swamp and searched minutely all around his room but he could not discover the least thing to give him further cause for alarm
He unlocked his case took out his wheel and for the remainder of the day he rode and watched as he never had before
Several times he locked the wheel and crossed the swamp on foot zigzagging to cover all the space possible
Every rod he traveled he used the caution that sprang from knowledge of danger and the direction from which it probably would come
Several times he thought of sending for McLean but for his life he could not make up his mind to do it with nothing more tangible than one footprint to justify him
He waited until he was sure Duncan would be at home if he were coming for the night before he went to supper
The first thing he saw as he crossed the swale was the big bays in the yard
There had been no one passing that day and Duncan readily agreed to watch until Freckles rode to town
He told Duncan of the footprint and urged him to guard closely
Duncan said he might rest easy and filling his pipe and taking a good revolver the big man went to the Limberlost
Freckles made himself clean and neat and raced to town but it was night and the stars were shining before he reached the home of the Bird Woman
From afar he could see that the house was ablaze with lights
The lawn and veranda were strung with fancy lanterns and alive with people
He thought his errand important so to turn back never occurred to Freckles
This was all the time or opportunity he would have
He must see the Bird Woman and see her at once
He leaned his wheel inside the fence and walked up the broad front entrance
As he neared the steps he saw that the place was swarming with young people and the Angel with an excuse to a group that surrounded her came hurrying to him
Oh Freckles
she cried delightedly
So you could come
We were so afraid you could not
Im as glad as I can be
I dont understand said Freckles
Were you expecting me
Why of course
exclaimed the Angel
Havent you come to my party
Didnt you get my invitation
I sent you one
By mail
asked Freckles
Yes said the Angel
I had to help with the preparations and I couldnt find time to drive out but I wrote you a letter and told you that the Bird Woman was giving a party for me and we wanted you to come surely
I told them at the office to put it with Mr Duncans mail
Then thats likely where it is at present said Freckles
Duncan comes to town only once a week and at times not that
Hes home tonight for the first in a week
Hes watching an hour for me until I come to the Bird Woman with a bit of work I thought shed be caring to hear about bad
Is she where I can see her
The Angels face clouded
What a disappointment
she cried
I did so want all my friends to know you
Cant you stay anyway
Freckles glanced from his wadingboots to the patent leathers of some of the Angels friends and smiled whimsically but there was no danger of his ever misjudging her again
You know I cannot Angel he said
I am afraid I do she said ruefully
Its too bad
But there is a thing I want for you more than to come to my party and that is to hang on and win with your work
I think of you every day and I just pray that those thieves are not getting ahead of you
Oh Freckles do watch closely
She was so lovely a picture as she stood before him ardent in his cause that Freckles could not take his eyes from her to notice what her friends were thinking
If she did not mind why should he
Anyway if they really were the Angels friends probably they were better accustomed to her ways than he
Her face and bared neck and arms were like the wild rose bloom
Her soft frock of white tulle lifted and stirred around her with the gentle evening air
The beautiful golden hair that crept around her temples and ears as if it loved to cling there was caught back and bound with broad blue satin ribbon
There was a sash of blue at her waist and knots of it catching up her draperies
Must I go after the Bird Woman
she pleaded
Indade you must answered Freckles firmly
The Angel went away but returned to say that the Bird Woman was telling a story to those inside and she could not come for a short time
You wont come in
she pleaded
I must not said Freckles
I am not dressed to be among your friends and I might be forgetting meself and stay too long
Then said the Angel we mustnt go through the house because it would disturb the story but I want you to come the outside way to the conservatory and have some of my birthday lunch and some cake to take to Mrs Duncan and the babies
Wont that be fun
Freckles thought that it would be more than fun and followed delightedly
The Angel gave him a big glass brimming with some icy sparkling liquid that struck his palate as it never had been touched before because a combination of frosty fruit juices had not been a frequent beverage with him
The night was warm and the Angel most beautiful and kind
A triple delirium of spirit mind and body seized upon him and developed a boldness all unnatural
He slightly parted the heavy curtains that separated the conservatory from the company and looked between
He almost stopped breathing
He had read of things like that but he never had seen them
The open space seemed to stretch through half a dozen rooms all ablaze with lights perfumed with flowers and filled with elegantly dressed people
There were glimpses of polished floors sparkling glass and fine furnishings
From somewhere the voice of his beloved Bird Woman arose and fell
The Angel crowded beside him and was watching also
Doesnt it look pretty
she whispered
Do you suppose Heaven is any finer than that
asked Freckles
The Angel began to laugh
Do you want to be laughing harder than that
queried Freckles
A laugh is always good said the Angel
A little more avoirdupois wont hurt me
Go ahead
Well then said Freckles its only that I feel all over as if I belonged there
I could wear fine clothes and move over those floors and hold me own against the best of them
But where does my laugh come in
demanded the Angel as if she had been defrauded
And you ask me where the laugh comes in looking me in the face after that marveled Freckles
I wouldnt be so foolish as to laugh at such a manifest truth as that said the Angel
Anyone who knows you even half as well as I do knows that you are never guilty of a discourtesy and you move with twice the grace of any man here
Why shouldnt you feel as if you belonged where people are graceful and courteous
On me soul
said Freckles you are kind to be thinking it
You are doubly kind to be saying it
The curtains parted and a woman came toward them
Her silks and laces trailed across the polished floors
The lights gleamed on her neck and arms and flashed from rare jewels
She was smiling brightly and until she spoke Freckles had not realized fully that it was his loved Bird Woman
Noticing his bewilderment she cried Why Freckles
Dont you know me in my war clothes
I do in the uniform in which you fight the Limberlost said Freckles
The Bird Woman laughed
Then he told her why he had come but she scarcely could believe him
She could not say exactly when she would go but she would make it as soon as possible for she was most anxious for the study
While they talked the Angel was busy packing a box of sandwiches cake fruit and flowers
She gave him a last frosty glass thanked him repeatedly for bringing news of new material then Freckles went into the night
He rode toward the Limberlost with his eyes on the stars
Presently he removed his hat hung it to his belt and ruffled his hair to the sweep of the night wind
He filled the air all the way with snatches of oratorios gospel hymns and dialect and coon songs in a startlingly varied programme
The one thing Freckles knew that he could do was to sing
The Duncans heard him coming a mile up the corduroy and could not believe their senses
Freckles unfastened the box from his belt and gave Mrs Duncan and the children all the eatables it contained except one big piece of cake that he carried to the sweetloving Duncan
He put the flowers back in the box and set it among his books
He did not say anything but they understood it was not to be touched
Thaes Freckles flowrs said a tiny Scotsman but he added cheerfully its oor sweeties
Freckles face slowly flushed as he took Duncans cake and started toward the swamp
While Duncan ate Freckles told him something about the evening as well as he could find words to express himself and the big man was so amazed he kept forgetting the treat in his hands
Then Freckles mounted his wheel and began a spin that terminated only when the biggest Plymouth Rock in Duncans coop saluted a new day and long lines of light reddened the east
As he rode he sang while he sang he worshiped but the god he tried to glorify was a dim and faraway mystery
The Angel was warm flesh and blood
Every time he passed the little barkcovered imprint on the trail he dismounted removed his hat solemnly knelt and laid his lips on the impression
Because he kept no account himself only the laughingfaced old man of the moon knew how often it happened and as from the beginning to the follies of earth that gentleman has ever been kind
With the near approach of dawn Freckles tuned his last note
Wearied almost to falling he turned from the trail into the path leading to the cabin for a few hours rest
CHAPTER XII Wherein Black Jack Captures Freckles and the Angel Captures Jack As Freckles left the trail from the swale close the south entrance four large muscular men arose and swiftly and carefully entered the swamp by the wagon road
Two of them carried a big saw the third coils of rope and wire and all of them were heavily armed
They left one man on guard at the entrance
The other three made their way through the darkness as best they could and were soon at Freckles room
He had left the swamp on his wheel from the west trail
They counted on his returning on the wheel and circling the east line before he came there
A little below the west entrance to Freckles room Black Jack stepped into the swale and binding a wire tightly around a scrub oak carried it below the waving grasses stretched it taut across the trail and fastened it to a tree in the swamp
Then he obliterated all signs of his work and arranged the grass over the wire until it was so completely covered that only minute examination would reveal it
They entered Freckles room with coarse oaths and jests
In a few moments his specimen case with its precious contents was rolled into the swamp while the saw was eating into one of the finest trees of the Limberlost
The first report from the man on watch was that Duncan had driven to the South camp the second that Freckles was coming
The man watching was sent to see on which side the boy turned into the path as they had expected he took the east
He was a little tired and his head was rather stupid for he had not been able to sleep as he had hoped but he was very happy
Although he watched until his eyes ached he could see no sign of anyone having entered the swamp
He called a cheery greeting to all his chickens
At Sleepy Snake Creek he almost fell from his wheel with surprise the sawbird was surrounded by four lanky youngsters clamoring for breakfast
The father was strutting with all the importance of a drum major
No use to expect the Bird Woman today said Freckles but now wouldnt she be jumping for a chance at that
As soon as Freckles was far down the east line the watch was posted below the room on the west to report his coming
It was only a few moments before the signal came
Then the saw stopped and the rope was brought out and uncoiled close to a sapling
Wessner and Black Jack crowded to the very edge of the swamp a little above the wire and crouched waiting
They heard Freckles before they saw him
He came gliding down the line swiftly and as he rode he was singing softly Oh do you love Oh say you love He got no farther
The sharply driven wheel struck the tense wire and bounded back
Freckles shot over the handlebar and coasted down the trail on his chest
As he struck Black Jack and Wessner were upon him
Wessner caught off an old felt hat and clapped it over Freckles mouth while Black Jack twisted the boys arms behind him and they rushed him into his room
Almost before he realized that anything had happened he was trussed to a tree and securely gagged
Then three of the men resumed work on the tree
The other followed the path Freckles had worn to Little Chickens tree and presently he reported that the wires were down and two teams with the loading apparatus coming to take out the timber
All the time the saw was slowly eating eating into the big tree
Wessner went to the trail and removed the wire
He picked up Freckles wheel that did not seem to be injured and leaned it against the bushes so that if anyone did pass on the trail he would not see it doubled in the swampgrass
Then he came and stood in front of Freckles and laughed in devilish hate
To his own amazement Freckles found himself looking fear in the face and marveled that he was not afraid
Four to one
The tree halfway eaten through the wagons coming up the inside roadhe bound and gagged
The men with Black Jack and Wessner had belonged to McLeans gang when last he had heard of them but who those coming with the wagons might be he could not guess
If they secured that tree McLean lost its value lost his wager and lost his faith in him
The words of the Angel hammered in his ears
Oh Freckles do watch closely
The saw worked steadily
When the tree was down and loaded what would they do
Pull out and leave him there to report them
It was not to be hoped for
The place always had been lawless
It could mean but one thing
A mist swept before his eyes while his head swam
Was it only last night that he had worshiped the Angel in a delirium of happiness
And now what
Wessner released from a turn at the saw walked to the flower bed and tearing up a handful of rare ferns by the roots started toward Freckles
His intention was obvious
Black Jack stopped him with an oath
You see here Dutchy he bawled mebby you think youll wash his face with that but you wont
A contracts a contract
We agreed to take out these trees and leave him for you to dispose of whatever way you please provided you shut him up eternally on this deal
But Ill not see a tied man tormented by a fellow that he can lick up the ground with loose and thats flat
It raises my gorge to think what hell get when were gone but you neednt think youre free to begin before
Dont you lay a hand on him while Im here
What do you say boys
I say yes growled one of McLeans latest deserters
Whats more were a pack of fools to risk the dirty work of silencing him
You had him face down and you on his back why the hell didnt you cover his head and roll him into the bushes until we were gone
When I went into this I didnt understand that he was to see all of us and that there was murder on the ticket
Im not up to it
I dont mind lifting trees we came for but Im cursed if I want blood on my hands
Well you aint going to get it bellowed Jack
You fellows only contracted to help me get out my marked trees
He belong to Wessner and it aint in our deal what happens to him
Yes and if Wessner finishes him safely we are practically in for murder as well as stealing the trees and if he dont all hells to pay
I think youve made a damnable bungle of this thing thats what I think
Then keep your thoughts to yourself cried Jack
Were doing this and its all planned safe and sure
As for killing that buckcome to think of it killing is what he needs
Hes away too good for this world of woe anyhow
I tell you its all safe enough
His dropping out wont be the only secret the old Limberlost has never told
Its too dead easy to make it look like he helped take the timber and then cut
Why hes played right into our hands
He was here at the swamp all last night and back again in an hour or so
When we get our plan worked out even old fool Duncan wont lift a finger to look for his carcass
We couldnt have him going in better shape
You just bet said Wessner
I owe him all hell get and be damned to you but Ill pay
he snarled at Freckles
So it was killing then
They were not only after this one tree but many and with his body it was their plan to kill his honor
To brand him a thief with them before the Angel the Bird Woman the dear Boss and the DuncansFreckles in sick despair sagged against the ropes
Then he gathered his forces and thought swiftly
There was no hope of McLeans coming
They had chosen a day when they knew he had a big contract at the South camp
The Boss could not come before tomorrow by any possibility and there would be no tomorrow for the boy
Duncan was on his way to the South camp and the Bird Woman had said she would come as soon as she could
After the fatigue of the party it was useless to expect her and the Angel today and God save them from coming
The Angels father had said they would be as safe in the Limberlost as at home
What would he think of this
The sweat broke on Freckles forehead
He tugged at the ropes whenever he felt that he dared but they were passed around the tree and his body several times and knotted on his chest
He was helpless
There was no hope no help
And after they had conspired to make him appear a runaway thief to his loved ones what was it that Wessner would do to him
Whatever it was Freckles lifted his head and resolved that he would bear in mind what he had once heard the Bird Woman say
He would go out bonnily
Never would he let them see if he grew afraid
After all what did it matter what they did to his body if by some scheme of the devil they could encompass his disgrace
Then hope suddenly rose high in Freckles breast
They could not do that
The Angel would not believe
Neither would McLean
He would keep up his courage
Kill him they could dishonor him they could not
Yet summon all the fortitude he might that saw eating into the tree rasped his nerves worse and worse
With whirling brain he gazed into the Limberlost searching for something he knew not what and in blank horror found his eyes focusing on the Angel
She was quite a distance away but he could see her white lips and angry expression
Last week he had taken her and the Bird Woman across the swamp over the path he followed in going from his room to the chicken tree
He had told them the night before that the butterfly tree was on the line close to this path
In figuring on their not coming that day he failed to reckon with the enthusiasm of the Bird Woman
They must be there for the study and the Angel had risked crossing the swamp in search of him
Or was there something in his room they needed
The blood surged in his ears as the roar of the Limberlost in the wrath of a storm
He looked again and it had been a dream
She was not there
Had she been
For his life Freckles could not tell whether he really had seen the Angel or whether his strained senses had played him the most cruel trick of all
Or was it not the kindest
Now he could go with the vision of her lovely face fresh with him
Thank You for that oh God
whispered Freckles
Twas more than kind of You and I dont spose I ought to be wanting anything else but if You can oh I wish I could know before this ends if twas me motherFreckles could not even whisper the words for he hesitated a second and endedIF TWAS ME MOTHER DID IT
Freckles
Freckles
Oh Freckles
the voice of the Angel came calling
Freckles swayed forward and wrenched at the rope until it cut deeply into his body
Hell
cried Black Jack
Who is that
Do you know
Freckles nodded
Jack whipped out a revolver and snatched the gag from Freckles mouth
Say quick or its up with you right now and whoever that is with you
Its the girl the Bird Woman takes with her whispered Freckles through dry swollen lips
They aint due here for five days yet said Wessner
We got on to that last week
Yes said Freckles but I found a tree covered with butterflies and things along the east line yesterday that I thought the Bird Woman would want extra and I went to town to tell her last night
She said shed come soon but she didnt say when
They must be here
I take care of the girl while the Bird Woman works
Untie me quick until she is gone
Ill try to send her back and then you can go on with your dirty work
He aint lying volunteered Wessner
I saw that tree covered with butterflies and him watching around it when we were spying on him yesterday
No he leaves lying to your sort snapped Black Jack as he undid the rope and pitched it across the room
Remember that youre covered every move you make my buck he cautioned
Freckles
Freckles
came the Angels impatient voice closer and closer
I must be answering said Freckles and Jack nodded
Right here
he called and to the men You go on with your work and remember one thing yourselves
The work of the Bird Woman is known all over the world
This girls father is a rich man and she is all he has
If you offer hurt of any kind to either of them this world has no place far enough away or dark enough for you to be hiding in
Hell will be easy to what any man will get if he touches either of them
Freckles where are you
demanded the Angel
Soulsick with fear for her Freckles went toward her and parted the bushes that she might enter
She came through without apparently giving him a glance and the first words she said were Why have the gang come so soon
I didnt know you expected them for three weeks yet
Or is this some especial tree that Mr McLean needs to fill an order right now
Freckles hesitated
Would a man dare lie to save himself
No
But to save the Angelsurely that was different
He opened his lips but the Angel was capable of saving herself
She walked among them exactly as if she had been reared in a lumber camp and never waited for an answer
Why your specimen case
she cried
Look
Havent you noticed that its tipped over
Set it straight quickly
A couple of the men stepped out and carefully righted the case
There
Thats better she said
Freckles Im surprised at your being so careless
It would be a shame to break those lovely butterflies for one old tree
Is that a valuable tree
Why didnt you tell us last night you were going to take out a tree this morning
Oh say did you put your case there to protect that tree from that stealing old Black Jack and his gang
I bet you did
Well if that wasnt bright
What kind of a tree is it
Its a white oak said Freckles
Like those they make diningtables and sideboards from
Yes
My
How interesting
she cried
I dont know a thing about timber but my father wants me to learn just everything I can
I am going to ask him to let me come here and watch you until I know enough to boss a gang myself
Do you like to cut trees gentlemen
she asked with angelic sweetness of the men
Some of them appeared foolish and some grim but one managed to say they did
Then the Angels eyes turned full on Black Jack and she gave the most natural little start of astonishment
Oh
I almost thought that you were a ghost
she cried
But I see now that you are really and truly
Were you ever in Colorado
No said Jack
I see you arent the same man said the Angel
You know we were in Colorado last year and there was a cowboy who was the handsomest man anywhere around
Hed come riding into town every night and all we girls just adored him
Oh but he was a beauty
I thought at first glance you were really he but I see now he wasnt nearly so tall nor so broad as you and only half as handsome
The men began to laugh while Jack flushed crimson
The Angel joined in the laugh
Well Ill leave it to you
Isnt he handsome
she challenged
As for that cowboys face it couldnt be compared with yours
The only trouble with you is that your clothes are spoiling you
Its the dress those cowboys wear that makes half their attraction
If you were properly clothed you could break the heart of the prettiest girl in the country
With one accord the other men looked at Black Jack and for the first time realized that he was a superb specimen of manhood for he stood six feet tall was broad wellrounded and had dark even skin big black eyes and full red lips
Ill tell you what
exclaimed the Angel
Id just love to see you on horseback
Nothing sets a handsome man off so splendidly
Do you ride
Yes said Jack and his eyes were burning on the Angel as if he would fathom the depths of her soul
Well said the Angel winsomely I know what I just wish youd do
I wish you would let your hair grow a little longer
Then wear a blue flannel shirt a little open at the throat a red tie and a broadbrimmed felt hat and ride past my house of evenings
Im always at home then and almost always on the veranda and oh
but I would like to see you
Will you do that for me
It is impossible to describe the art with which the Angel asked the question
She was looking straight into Jacks face coarse and hardened with sin and careless living which was now taking on a wholly different expression
The evil lines of it were softening and fading under her clear gaze
A dull red flamed into his bronze cheeks while his eyes were growing brightly tender
Yes he said and the glance he gave the men was of such a nature that no one saw fit even to change countenance
Oh goody
she cried tilting on her toes
Ill ask all the girls to come see but they neednt stick in
We can get along without them cant we
Jack leaned toward her
He was the charmed fluttering bird while the Angel was the snake
Well I rather guess
he cried
The Angel drew a deep breath and surveyed him rapturously
My but youre tall
she commented
Do you suppose I ever will grow to reach your shoulders
She stood on tiptoe and measured the distance with her eyes
Then she developed timid confusion while her glance sought the ground
I wish I could do something she half whispered
Jack seemed to increase an inch in height
What
he asked hoarsely
Lariat Bill used always to have a bunch of red flowers in his shirt pocket
The red lit up his dark eyes and olive cheeks and made him splendid
May I put some red flowers on you
Freckles stared as he wheezed for breath
He wished the earth would open and swallow him
Was he dead or alive
Since his Angel had seen Black Jack she never had glanced his way
Was she completely bewitched
Would she throw herself at the mans feet before them all
Couldnt she give him even one thought
Hadnt she seen that he was gagged and bound
Did she truly think that these were McLeans men
Why she could not
It was only a few days ago that she had been close enough to this man and angry enough with him to peel the hat from his head with a shot
Suddenly a thing she had said jestingly to him one day came back with startling force You must take Angels on trust
Of course you must
She was his Angel
She must have seen
His life and what was far more her own was in her hands
There was nothing he could do but trust her
Surely she was working out some plan
The Angel knelt beside his flower bed and recklessly tore up by the roots a big bunch of foxfire
These stems are so tough and sticky she said
I cant break them
Loan me your knife she ordered Freckles
As she reached for the knife her back was for one second toward the men
She looked into his eyes and deliberately winked
She severed the stems tossed the knife to Freckles and walking to Jack laid the flowers over his heart
Freckles broke into a sweat of agony
He had said she would be safe in a herd of howling savages
Would she
If Black Jack even made a motion toward touching her Freckles knew that from somewhere he would muster the strength to kill him
He mentally measured the distance to where his club lay and set his muscles for a spring
But noby the splendor of God
The big fellow was baring his head with a hand that was unsteady
The Angel pulled one of the long silver pins from her hat and fastened her flowers securely
Freckles was quaking
What was to come next
What was she planning and oh
did she understand the danger of her presence among those men the real necessity for action
As the Angel stepped from Jack she turned her head to one side and peered at him quite as Freckles had seen the little yellow fellow do on the line a hundred times and said Well that does the trick
Isnt that fine
See how it sets him off boys
Dont you forget the tie is to be red and the first ride soon
I cant wait very long
Now I must go
The Bird Woman will be ready to start and she will come here hunting me next for she is busy today
What did I come here for anyway
She glanced inquiringly around and several of the men laughed
Oh the delight of it
She had forgotten her errand for him
Jack had a second increase in height
The Angel glanced helplessly as if seeking a clue
Then her eyes fell as if by accident on Freckles and she cried Oh I know now
It was those magazines the Bird Woman promised you
I came to tell you that we put them under the box where we hide things at the entrance to the swamp as we came in
I knew I would need my hands crossing the swamp so I hid them there
Youll find them at the same old place
Then Freckles spoke
Its mighty risky for you to be crossing the swamp alone he said
Im surprised that the Bird Woman would be letting you try it
I know its a little farther but its begging you I am to be going back by the trail
Thats bad enough but its far safer than the swamp
The Angel laughed merrily
Oh stop your nonsense
she cried
Im not afraid
Not in the least
The Bird Woman didnt want me to try following a path that Id been over only once but I was sure I could do it and Im rather proud of the performance
Now dont go babying
You know Im not afraid
No said Freckles gently I know youre not but that has nothing to do with the fact that your friends are afraid for you
On the trail you can see your way a bit ahead and youve all the world a better chance if you meet a snake
Then Freckles had an inspiration
He turned to Jack imploringly
You tell her
he pleaded
Tell her to go by the trail
She will for you
The implication of this statement was so gratifying to Black Jack that he seemed again to expand and take on increase before their very eyes
You bet
exclaimed Jack
And to the Angel You better take Freckles word for it miss
He knows the old swamp better than any of us except me and if he says go by the trail youd best do it
The Angel hesitated
She wanted to recross the swamp and try to reach the horse
She knew Freckles would brave any danger to save her crossing the swamp alone but she really was not afraid while the trail added over a mile to the walk
She knew the path
She intended to run for dear life the instant she felt herself from their sight and tucked in the folds of her blouse was a fine little 32caliber revolver that her father had presented her for her share in what he was pleased to call her military exploit
One last glance at Freckles showed her the agony in his eyes and immediately she imagined he had some other reason
She would follow the trail
All right she said giving Jack a thrilling glance
If you say so Ill return by the trail to please you
Goodbye everybody
She lifted the bushes and started toward the entrance
You damned fool
Stop her
growled Wessner
Keep her till were loaded anyhow
Youre playing hell
Cant you see that when this thing is found out there shell be to ruin all of us
If you let her go every man of us has got to cut and some of us will be caught sure
Jack sprang forward
Freckles heart muffled in his throat
The Angel seemed to divine Jacks coming
She was humming a little song
She deliberately stopped and began pulling the heads of the curious grasses that grew all around her
When she straightened she took a step backward and called Ho
Freckles the Bird Woman wants that natural history pamphlet returned
It belongs to a set she is going to have bound
Thats one of the reasons we put it under the box
You be sure to get them as you go home tonight for fear it rains or becomes damp with the heavy dews
All right said Freckles but it was in a voice that he never had heard before
Then the Angel turned and sent a parting glance at Jack
She was overpoweringly human and bewitchingly lovely
You wont forget that ride and the red tie she half asserted half questioned
Jack succumbed
Freckles was his captive but he was the Angels soul and body
His face wore the holiest look it ever had known as he softly reechoed Freckles All right
With her head held well up the Angel walked slowly away and Jack turned to the men
Drop your damned staring and saw wood he shouted
Dont you know anything at all about how to treat a lady
It might have been a question which of the cronies that crouched over green wood fires in the cabins of Wildcat Hollow eternally sucking a corncob pipe and stirring the endless kettles of stewing coon and opossum had taught him to do even as well as he had by the Angel
The men muttered and threatened among themselves but they began working desperately
Someone suggested that a man be sent to follow the Angel and to watch her and the Bird Woman leave the swamp
Freckles heart sank within him but Jack was in a delirium and past all caution
Yes he sneered
Mebby all of you had better give over on the saw and run after the girl
I guess not
Seems to me I got the favors
I didnt see no bouquets on the rest of you
If anybody follows her I do and Im needed here among such a pack of idiots
Theres no danger in that baby face
She wouldnt give me away
You double and work like forty while me and Wessner will take the axes and begin to cut in on the other side
What about the noise
asked Wessner
No difference about the noise answered Jack
She took us to be from McLeans gang slick as grease
Make the chips fly
So all of them attacked the big tree
Freckles sat on one of his benches and waited
In their haste to fell the tree and load it so that the teamsters could start and leave them free to attack another they had forgotten to rebind him
The Angel was on the trail and safely started
The cold perspiration made Freckles temples clammy and ran in little streams down his chest
It would take her more time to follow the trail but her safety was Freckles sole thought in urging her to go that way
He tried to figure on how long it would require to walk to the carriage
He wondered if the Bird Woman had unhitched
He followed the Angel every step of the way
He figured on when she would cross the path of the clearing pass the deep pool where his findout frog lived cross Sleepy Snake Creek and reach the carriage
He wondered what she would say to the Bird Woman and how long it would take them to pack and start
He knew now that they would understand and the Angel would try to get the Boss there in time to save his wager
She could never do it for the saw was over half through and Jack and Wessner cutting into the opposite side of the tree
It appeared as if they could fell at least that tree before McLean could come and if they did he lost his wager
When it was down would they rebind him and leave him for Wessner to wreak his insane vengeance on or would they take him along to the next tree and dispose of him when they had stolen all the timber they could
Jack had said that he should not be touched until he left
Surely he would not run all that risk for one tree when he had many others of far greater value marked
Freckles felt that he had some hope to cling to now but he found himself praying that the Angel would hurry
Once Jack came to Freckles and asked if he had any water
Freckles arose and showed him where he kept his drinkingwater
Jack drank in great gulps and as he passed back the bucket he said When a mans got a chance of catching a fine girl like that he ought not be mixed up in any dirty business
I wish to God I was out of this
Freckles answered heartily I wish I was too
Jack stared at him a minute and then broke into a roar of rough laughter
Blest if I blame you he said
But you had your chance
We offered you a fair thing and you gave Wessner his answer
I aint envying you when he gives you his
Youre six to one answered Freckles
It will be easy enough for you to be killing the body of me but curse you all you cant blacken me soul
Well Id give anything you could name if I had your honesty said Jack
When the mighty tree fell the Limberlost shivered and screamed with the echo
Freckles groaned in despair but the gang took heart
That was so much accomplished
They knew where to dispose of it safely with no questions asked
Before the day was over they could remove three others all suitable for veneer and worth far more than this
Then they would leave Freckles to Wessner and scatter for safety with more money than they had ever hoped for in their possession
CHAPTER XIII Wherein the Angel Releases Freckles and the Curse of Black Jack Falls upon Her On the line the Angel gave one backward glance at Black Jack to see that he had returned to his work
Then she gathered her skirts above her knees and leaped forward on the run
In the first three yards she passed Freckles wheel
Instantly she imagined that was why he had insisted on her coming by the trail
She seized it and sprang on
The saddle was too high but she was an expert rider and could catch the pedals as they came up
She stopped at Duncans cabin long enough to remedy this telling Mrs Duncan while working what was happening and for her to follow the east trail until she found the Bird Woman and told her that she had gone after McLean and for her to leave the swamp as quickly as possible
Even with her fear for Freckles to spur her Sarah Duncan blanched and began shivering at the idea of facing the Limberlost
The Angel looked her in the eyes
No matter how afraid you are you have to go she said
If you dont the Bird Woman will go to Freckles room hunting me and they will have trouble with her
If she isnt told to leave at once they may follow me and finding Im gone do some terrible thing to Freckles
I cant gothats flatfor if they caught me then thered be no one to go for help
You dont suppose they are going to take out the trees theyre after and then leave Freckles to run and tell
They are going to murder the boy thats what they are going to do
You run and run for life
For Freckles life
You can ride back with the Bird Woman
The Angel saw Mrs Duncan started then began her race
Those awful miles of corduroy
Would they never end
She did not dare use the wheel too roughly for if it broke she never could arrive on time afoot
Where her way was impassable for the wheel she jumped off and pushing it beside her or carrying it she ran as fast as she could
The day was fearfully warm
The sun poured with the fierce baking heat of August
The bushes claimed her hat and she did not stop for it
Where it was at all possible the Angel mounted and pounded over the corduroy again
She was panting for breath and almost worn out when she reached the level pike
She had no idea how long she had beenand only two miles covered
She leaned over the bars almost standing on the pedals racing with all the strength in her body
The blood surged in her ears while her head swam but she kept a straight course and rode and rode
It seemed to her that she was standing still while the trees and houses were racing past her
Once a farmers big dog rushed angrily into the road and she swerved until she almost fell but she regained her balance and setting her muscles pedaled as fast as she could
At last she lifted her head
Surely it could not be over a mile more
She had covered two of corduroy and at least three of gravel and it was only six in all
She was reeling in the saddle but she gripped the bars with new energy and raced desperately
The sun beat on her bare head and hands
Just when she was choking with dust and almost prostrate with heat and exhaustioncrash she ran into a broken bottle
Snap
went the tire the wheel swerved and pitched over
The Angel rolled into the thick yellow dust of the road and lay quietly
From afar Duncan began to notice a strange dustcovered object in the road as he headed toward town with the first load of the days felling
He chirruped to the bays and hurried them all he could
As he neared the Angel he saw it was a woman and a broken wheel
He was beside her in an instant
He carried her to a shaded fencecorner stretched her on the grass and wiped the dust from the lovely face all dirtstreaked crimson and bearing a startling whiteness around the mouth and nose
Wheels were common enough
Many of the farmers daughters owned and rode them but he knew these same farmers daughters this face was a strangers
He glanced at the Angels tumbled clothing the silkiness of her hair with its pale satin ribbon and noticed that she had lost her hat
Her lips tightened in an ominous quiver
He left her and picked up the wheel as he had surmised he knew it
This then was Freckles Swamp Angel
There was trouble in the Limberlost and she had broken down racing to McLean
Duncan turned the bays into a fencecorner tied one of them unharnessed the other fastened up the trace chains and hurried to the nearest farmhouse to send help to the Angel
He found a woman who took a bottle of camphor a jug of water and some towels and started on the run
Then Duncan put the bay to speed and raced to camp
The Angel left alone lay still for a second then she shivered and opened her eyes
She saw that she was on the grass and the broken wheel beside her
Instantly she realized that someone had carried her there and gone after help
She sat up and looked around
She noticed the load of logs and the one horse
Someone was riding after help for her
Oh poor Freckles
she wailed
They may be killing him by now
Oh how much time have I wasted
She hurried to the other bay her fingers flying as she set him free
Snatching up a big blacksnake whip that lay on the ground she caught the hames stretched along the horses neck and for the first time the fine big fellow felt on his back the quality of the lash that Duncan was accustomed to crack over him
He was frightened and ran at top speed
The Angel passed a wildly waving screaming woman on the road and a little later a man riding as if he too were in great haste
The man called to her but she only lay lower and used the whip
Soon the feet of the mans horse sounded farther and farther away
At the South camp they were loading a second wagon when the Angel appeared riding one of Duncans bays lathered and dripping and cried Everybody go to Freckles
There are thieves stealing trees and they had him bound
Theyre going to kill him
She wheeled the horse toward the Limberlost
The alarm sounded through camp
The gang were not unprepared
McLean sprang to Nellies back and raced after the Angel
As they passed Duncan he wheeled and followed
Soon the pike was an irregular procession of barebacked riders wildly driving flying horses toward the swamp
The Boss rode neckandneck with the Angel
He repeatedly commanded her to stop and fall out of line until he remembered that he would need her to lead him to Freckles
Then he gave up and rode beside her for she was sending the bay at as sharp a pace as the other horses could keep and hold out
He could see that she was not hearing him
He glanced back and saw that Duncan was close
There was something terrifying in the appearance of the big man and the manner in which he sat his beast and rode
It would be a sad day for the man on whom Duncans wrath broke
There were four others close behind him and the pike filling with the remainder of the gang so McLean took heart and raced beside the Angel
Over and over he asked her where the trouble was but she only gripped the hames leaned along the bays neck and slashed away with the blacksnake
The steaming horse with crimson nostrils and heaving sides stretched out and ran for home with all the speed there was in him
When they passed the cabin the Bird Womans carriage was there and Mrs Duncan in the door wringing her hands but the Bird Woman was nowhere to be seen
The Angel sent the bay along the path and turned into the west trail while the men bunched and followed her
When she reached the entrance to Freckles room there were four men with her and two more very close behind
She slid from the horse and snatching the little revolver from her pocket darted toward the bushes
McLean caught them back and with drawn weapon pressed beside her
There they stopped in astonishment
The Bird Woman blocked the entrance
Over a small limb lay her revolver
It was trained at short range on Black Jack and Wessner who stood with their hands above their heads
Freckles with the blood trickling down his face from an ugly cut in his temple was gagged and bound to the tree again the remainder of the men were gone
Black Jack was raving as a maniac and when they looked closer it was only the left arm that he raised
His right with the hand shattered hung helpless at his side while his revolver lay at Freckles feet
Wessners weapon was in his belt and beside him Freckles club
Freckles face was white with colorless lips but in his eyes was the strength of undying courage
McLean pushed past the Bird Woman crying
Hold steady on them only one minute more
He snatched the revolver from Wessners belt and stooped for Jacks
At that instant the Angel rushed past
She tore the gag from Freckles and seizing the rope knotted on his chest she tugged at it desperately
Under her fingers it gave way and she hurled it to McLean
The men were crowding in and Duncan seized Wessner
As the Angel saw Freckles stand out free she reached her arms to him and pitched forward
A fearful oath burst from the lips of Black Jack
To have saved his life Freckles could not have avoided the glance of triumph he gave Jack when folding the Angel in his arms and stretching her on the mosses
The Bird Woman cried out sharply for water as she ran to them
Someone sprang to bring that and another to break open the case for brandy
As McLean arose from binding Wessner there was a cry that Jack was escaping
He was already far in the swamp running for its densest part in leaping bounds
Every man who could be spared plunged after him
Other members of the gang arriving were sent to follow the tracks of the wagons
The teamsters had driven from the west entrance and crossing the swale had taken the same route the Bird Woman and the Angel had before them
There had been ample time for the drivers to reach the road after that they could take any one of four directions
Traffic was heavy and lumber wagons were passing almost constantly so the men turned back and joined the more exciting hunt for a man
The remainder of the gang joined them also farmers of the region and travelers attracted by the disturbance
Watchers were set along the trail at short intervals
They patrolled the line and roads through the swamp that night with lighted torches and the next day McLean headed as thorough a search as he felt could be made of one side while Duncan covered the other but Black Jack could not be found
Spies were set around his home in Wildcat Hollow to ascertain if he reached there or aid was being sent in any direction to him but it was soon clear that his relatives were ignorant of his hidingplace and were searching for him
Great is the elasticity of youth
A hot bath and a sound nights sleep renewed Freckles strength and it needed but little more to work the same result with the Angel
Freckles was on the trail early the next morning
Besides a crowd of people anxious to witness Jacks capture he found four stalwart guards one at each turn
In his heart he was compelled to admit that he was glad to have them there
Close noon McLean placed his men in charge of Duncan and taking Freckles drove to town to see how the Angel fared
McLean visited a greenhouse and bought an armload of its finest products but Freckles would have none of them
He would carry his message in a glowing mass of the Limberlosts first goldenrod
The Bird Woman received them and in answer to their eager inquiries said that the Angel was in no way seriously injured only so bruised and shaken that their doctor had ordered her to lie quietly for the day
Though she was sore and stiff they were having work to keep her in bed
Her callers sent up their flowers with their grateful regards and the Angel promptly returned word that she wanted to see them
She reached both hands to McLean
What if one old tree is gone
You dont care sir
You feel that Freckles has kept his trust as nobody ever did before dont you
You wont forget all those long first days of fright that you told us of the fearful cold of winter the rain heat and lonesomeness and the brave days and lately nights too and let him feel that his trust is broken
Oh Mr McLean she begged say something to him
Do something to make him feel that it isnt for nothing he has watched and suffered it out with that old Limberlost
Make him see how great and fine it is and how far far better he has done than you or any of us expected
Whats one old tree anyway
she cried passionately
I was thinking before you came
Those other men were rank big cowards
They were scared for their lives
If they were the drivers I wager you gloves against gloves they never took those logs out to the pike
My coming upset them
Before you feel bad any more you go look and see if they didnt lose courage the minute they left Wessner and Black Jack dump that timber and run
I dont believe they ever had the grit to drive out with it in daylight
Go see if they didnt figure on leaving the way we did the other morning and youll find the logs before you reach the road
They never risked taking them into the open when they got away and had time to think
Of course they didnt
And then another thing
You havent lost your wager
It never will be claimed because you made it with a stout dark redfaced man who drives a bay and a gray
He was right back of you Mr McLean when I came yesterday
He went deathly white and shook on his feet when he saw those men probably would be caught
Some one of them was something to him and you can just spot him for one of the men at the bottom of your troubles and urging those younger fellows to steal from you
I suppose hed promised to divide
You settle with him and that business will stop
She turned to Freckles
And you be the happiest man alive because you have kept your trust
Go look where I tell you and youll find the logs
I can see just about where they are
When they go up that steep little hill into the next woods after the cornfield why they could unloose the chains and the logs would roll from the wagons themselves
Now you go look and Mr McLean you do feel that Freckles has been brave and faithful
You wont love him any the less even if you dont find the logs The Angels nerve gave way and she began to cry
Freckles could not endure it
He almost ran from the room with the tears in his eyes but McLean took the Angel from the Bird Womans arms and kissed her brave little face stroked her hair and petted her into quietness before he left
As they drove to the swamp McLean so earnestly seconded all that the Angel had said that he soon had the boy feeling much better
Freckles your Angel has a spice of the devil in her but shes superb
You neednt spend any time questioning or bewailing anything she does
Just worship blindly my boy
By heaven
shes sense courage and beauty for half a dozen girls said McLean
Its altogether right you are sir affirmed Freckles heartily
Presently he added Theres no question but the series is over now
Dont think it
answered McLean
The Bird Woman is working for success and success along any line is not won by being scared out
She will be back on the usual day and ten to one the Angel will be with her
They are made of pretty stern stuff and they dont scare worth a cent
Before I left I told the Bird Woman it would be safe and it will
You may do your usual walking but those four guards are there to remain
They are under your orders absolutely
They are prohibited from firing on any bird or molesting anything that you want to protect but there they remain and this time it is useless for you to say one word
I have listened to your pride too long
You are too precious to me and that voice of yours is too precious to the world to run any more risks
I am sorry to have anything spoil the series said Freckles and Id love them to be coming the Angel especial but it cant be
Youll have to tell them so
You see Jack would have been ready to stake his life she meant what she said and did to him
When the teams pulled out Wessner seized me then he and Jack went to quarreling over whether they should finish me then or take me to the next tree they were for felling
Between them they were pulling me around and hurting me bad
Wessner wanted to get at me right then and Jack said he shouldnt be touching me till the last tree was out and all the rest of them gone
Im belaying Jack really hated to see me done for in the beginning and I think too he was afraid if Wessner finished me then hed lose his nerve and cut and they couldnt be managing the felling without him anyway they were hauling me round like I was already past all feeling and they tied me up again
To keep me courage up I twits Wessner about having to tie me and needing another man to help handle me
I told him what Id do to him if I was free and he grabs up me own club and lays open me head with it
When the blood came streaming it set Jack raving and he cursed and damned Wessner for a coward and a softy
Then Wessner turned on Jack and gives it to him for letting the Angel make a fool of him
Tells him she was just playing with him and beyond all manner of doubt shed gone after you and there was nothing to do on account of his foolishness but finish me get out and let the rest of the timber go for likely you was on the way right then
That drove Jack plum crazy
I dont think he was for having a doubt of the Angel before but then he just raved
He grabbed out his gun and turned on Wessner
Spang
It went out of his fist and the order comes Hands up
Wessner reached for kingdom come like he was expecting to grab hold and pull himself up
Jack puts up what he has left
Then he leans over to me and tells me what hell do to me if he ever gets out of there alive
Then just like a snake hissing he spits out what hell do to her for playing him
He did get away and with his strength that wound in his hand wont be bothering him long
Hell do to me just what he said and when he hears it really was she that went after you why hell keep his oath about her
Hes lived in the swamp all his life sir and everybody says its always been the home of cutthroats outlaws and runaways
He knows its most secret places as none of the others
Hes alive
Hes in there now sir
Some way hell keep alive
If youd seen his face all scarlet with passion twisted with pain and black with hate and heard him swearing that oath youd know it was a sure thing
I aint done with him yet and Ive brought this awful thing on her
And I havent begun with him yet said McLean setting his teeth
Ive been away too slow and too easy believing thered be no greater harm than the loss of a tree
Ive sent for a couple of firstclass detectives
We will put them on his track and rout him out and rid the country of him
I dont propose for him to stop either our work or our pleasure
As for his being in the swamp now I dont believe it
Hed find a way out last night in spite of us
Dont you worry
I am at the helm now and Ill see to that gentleman in my own way
I wish to my soul you had seen and heard him
said Freckles unconvinced
They entered the swamp taking the route followed by the Bird Woman and the Angel
They really did find the logs almost where the Angel had predicted they would be
McLean went to the South camp and had an interview with Crowen that completely convinced him that the Angel was correct there also
But he had no proof so all he could do was to discharge the man although his guilt was so apparent that he offered to withdraw the wager
Then McLean sent for a pack of bloodhounds and put them on the trail of Black Jack
They clung to it on and on into the depths of the swamp leading their followers through what had been considered impassable and impenetrable ways and finally around near the west entrance and into the swale
Here the dogs bellowed raved and fell over each other in their excitement
They raced back and forth from swamp to swale but follow the scent farther they would not even though cruelly driven
At last their owner attributed their actions to snakes and as they were very valuable dogs abandoned the effort to urge them on
So that all they really established was the fact that Black Jack had eluded their vigilance and crossed the trail some time in the night
He had escaped to the swale from there he probably crossed the corduroy and reaching the lower end of the swamp had found friends
It was a great relief to feel that he was not in the swamp and it raised the spirits of every man on the line though many of them expressed regrets that he who was undoubtedly most to blame should escape while Wessner who in the beginning was only his tool should be left to punishment
But for Freckles with Jacks fearful oath ringing in his ears there was neither rest nor peace
He was almost ill when the day for the next study of the series arrived and he saw the Bird Woman and the Angel coming down the corduroy
The guards of the east line he left at their customary places but those of the west he brought over and placed one near Little Chickens tree and the other at the carriage
He was firm about the Angels remaining in the carriage that he did not offer to have unhitched
He went with the Bird Woman to secure the picture which was the easiest matter it had been at any time yet for the simple reason that the placing of the guards and the unusual movement around the swamp had made Mr and Mrs Chicken timid and they had not carried Little Chicken the customary amount of food
Freckles in the anxiety of the past few days had neglected him and he had been so hungry much of the time that when the Bird Woman held up a sweetbread although he had started toward the recesses of the log at her coming he stopped with slightly opened beak he waited anxiously for the treat and gave a study of great value showing every point of his head also his wing and tail development
When the Bird Woman proposed to look for other subjects close about the line Freckles went so far as to tell her that Jack had made fearful threats against the Angel
He implored her to take the Angel home and keep her under unceasing guard until Jack was located
He wanted to tell her all about it but he knew how dear the Angel was to her and he dreaded to burden her with his fears when they might prove groundless
He allowed her to go but afterward blamed himself severely for having done so
CHAPTER XIV Wherein Freckles Nurses a Heartache and Black Jack Drops Out McLean said Mrs Duncan as the Boss paused to greet her in passing the cabin do you know that Freckles hasna been in bed the past five nights and all hes eaten in that many days ye could pack into a pint cup
Why what does the boy mean
demanded McLean
Theres no necessity for him being on guard with the watch Ive set on the line
I had no idea he was staying down there
Hes no there said Mrs Duncan
He goes somewhere else
He leaves on his wheel juist after were abed and rides in close cockcrow or a little earlier and hes looking like death and nothing short of it
But where does he go
asked McLean in astonishment
Im no given to bearing tales out of school said Sarah Duncan but in this case Id tell ye if I could
What the trouble is I dinna ken
If it is no stopped hes in for dreadful sickness and I thought ye could find out and help him
Hes in sair trouble thats all I know
McLean sat brooding as he stroked Nellies neck
At last he said I suspect I understand
At any rate I think I can find out
Thank you for telling me
Yell no need telling once ye clap your eyes on him prophesied Mrs Duncan
His face is all a glistny yellow and hes peaked as a starving caged bird
McLean rode to the Limberlost and stopping in the shade sat waiting for Freckles whose hour for passing the foot of the lease had come
Along the north line came Freckles fairly staggering
When he turned east and reached Sleepy Snake Creek sliding through the swale as the long black snake for which it was named he sat on the bridge and closed his burning eyes but they would not remain shut
As if pulled by wires the heavy lids flew open while the outraged nerves and muscles of his body danced twitched and tingled
He bent forward and idly watched the limpid little stream flowing beneath his feet
Stretching into the swale it came creeping between an impenetrable wall of magnificent wild flowers vines and ferns
Milkweed goldenrod ironwort fringed gentians cardinalflowers and turtlehead stood on the very edge of the creek and every flower of them had a double in the water
Wild clematis crowned with snow the heads of trees scattered here and there on the bank
From afar the creek appeared to be murky dirty water
Really it was clear and sparkling
The tinge of blackness was gained from its bed of muck showing through the transparent current
He could see small and wonderfully marked fish
What became of them when the creek spread into the swamp
For one thing they would make mighty fine eating for the family of that selfsatisfied old blue heron
Freckles sat so quietly that soon the brim of his hat was covered with snakefeeders rasping their crisp wings and singing while they rested
Some of them settled on the club and one on his shoulder
He was so motionless feathers fur and gauze were so accustomed to him that all through the swale they continued their daily life and forgot he was there
The heron family were wading the mouth of the creek
Freckles idly wondered whether the nerveracking rasps they occasionally emitted indicated domestic felicity or a raging quarrel
He could not decide
A sheitpoke with flaring crest went stalking across a bare space close to the creeks mouth
A stately brown bittern waded into the clearflowing water lifting his feet high at every step and setting them down carefully as if he dreaded wetting them and with slightly parted beak stood eagerly watching around him for worms
Behind him were some mighty trees of the swamp above and below the bank glowed a solid wall of goldenrod
No wonder the ancients had chosen yellow as the color to represent victory for the fierce conquering hue of the sun was in it
They had done well too in selecting purple as the emblem of royalty
It was a dignified compelling color while in its warm tone there was a hint of blood
It was the Limberlosts hour to proclaim her sovereignty and triumph
Everywhere she flaunted her yellow banner and trailed the purple of her mantle that was paler in the thistleheads took on strength in the first opening asters and glowed and burned in the ironwort
He gazed into her damp mossy recesses where highpiled riven trees decayed under coats of living green where dainty vines swayed and clambered and here and there a yellow leaf fluttering down presaged the coming of winter
His love of the swamp laid hold of him and shook him with its force
Compellingly beautiful was the Limberlost but cruel withal for inside bleached the uncoffined bones of her victims while she had missed cradling him oh
so narrowly
He shifted restlessly the movement sent the snakefeeders skimming
The hum of life swelled and roared in his strained ears
Small turtles that had climbed on a log to sun splashed clumsily into the water
Somewhere in the timber of the bridge a bloodthirsty little frog cried sharply
KEELIM
KEELIM
Freckles muttered Its worse than that Black Jack swore to do to me little fellow
A muskrat waddled down the bank and swam for the swamp its pointed nose riffling the water into a shining trail in its wake
Then below the turtlelog a dripping silvergray head with shining eyes was cautiously lifted and Freckles hand slid to his revolver
Higher and higher came the head a long heavy furcoated body arose now half now threefourths from the water
Freckles looked at his shaking hand and doubted but he gathered his forces the shot rang and the otter lay quiet
He hurried down and tried to lift it
He scarcely could muster strength to carry it to the bridge
The consciousness that he really could go no farther with it made Freckles realize the fact that he was close the limit of human endurance
He could bear it little if any longer
Every hour the dear face of the Angel wavered before him and behind it the awful distorted image of Black Jack as he had sworn to the punishment he would mete out to her
He must either see McLean or else make a trip to town and find her father
Which should he do
He was almost a stranger so the Angels father might not be impressed with what he said as he would if McLean went to him
Then he remembered that McLean had said he would come that morning
Freckles never had forgotten before
He hurried on the east trail as fast as his tottering legs would carry him
He stopped when he came to the first guard and telling him of his luck asked him to get the otter and carry it to the cabin as he was anxious to meet McLean
Freckles passed the second guard without seeing him and hurried to the Boss
He took off his hat wiped his forehead and stood silent under the eyes of McLean
The Boss was dumbfounded
Mrs Duncan had led him to expect that he would find a change in Freckles but this was almost deathly
The fact was apparent that the boy scarcely knew what he was doing
His eyes had a glazed farsighted appearance that wrung the heart of the man who loved him
Without a thought of preliminaries McLean leaned in the saddle and drew Freckles to him
My poor lad
he said
My poor dear lad
tell me and we will try to right it
Freckles had twisted his fingers in Nellies mane
At the kind words his face dropped on McLeans thigh and he shook with a nervous chill
McLean gathered him closer and waited
When the guard came with the otter McLean without a word motioned him to lay it down and leave them
Freckles said McLean at last will you tell me or must I set to work in the dark and try to find the trouble
Oh I want to tell you
I must tell you sir shuddered Freckles
I cannot be bearing it the day out alone
I was coming to you when I remimbered you would be here
He lifted his face and gazed across the swale with his jaws set firmly a minute as if gathering his forces
Then he spoke
Its the Angel sir he said
Instinctively McLeans grip on him tightened and Freckles looked into the Bosss face in wonder
I tried the other day said Freckles and I couldnt seem to make you see
Its only that there hasnt been an hour waking or sleeping since the day she parted the bushes and looked into me room that the face of her hasnt been before me in all the tinderness beauty and mischief of it
She talked to me friendly like
She trusted me entirely to take right care of her
She helped me with things about me books
She traited me like I was born a gintleman and shared with me as if I were of her own blood
She walked the streets of the town with me before her friends with all the pride of a queen
She forgot herself and didnt mind the Bird Woman and run big risks to help me out that first day sir
This last time she walked into that gang of murderers took their leader and twisted him to the will of her
She outdone him and raced the life almost out of her trying to save me
Since I can remimber whatever the thing was that happened to me in the beginning has been me curse
Ive been bitter hard and smarting under it hopelessly
She came by and found me voice and put hope of life and success like other men into me in spite of it
Freckles held up his maimed arm
Look at it sir
he said
A thousand times Ive cursed it hanging there helpless
She took it on the street before all the people just as if she didnt see that it was a thing to hide and shrink from
Again and again Ive had the feeling with her if I didnt entirely forget it that she didnt see it was gone and I must he pointing it out to her
Her touch on it was so sacredlike at times since Ive caught meself looking at the awful thing near like I was proud of it sir
If I had been born your son she couldnt be traiting me more as her equal and she cant help knowing you aint truly me father
Nobody can know the homeliness or the ignorance of me better than I do and all me lack of birth relatives and money and whats it all to her
Freckles stepped back squared his shoulders and with a royal lift of his head looked straight into the Bosss eyes
You saw her in the beautiful little room of her and you cant be forgetting how she begged and plead with you for me
She touched me body and twas sanctified
She laid her lips on my brow and twas sacrament
Nobody knows the height of her better than me
Nobodys studied my depths closer
Theres no bridge for the great distance between us sir and clearest of all Im for realizing it but she risked terrible things when she came to me among that gang of thieves
She wore herself past bearing to save me from such an easy thing as death
Now heres me a man a big strong man and letting her live under that fearful oath so worse than any death twould be for her and lifting not a finger to save her
I cannot hear it sir
Its killing me by inches
Black Jacks hand may not have been hurt so bad
Any hour he may be creeping up behind her
Any minute the awful revenge he swore to be taking may in some way fall on her and I havent even warned her father
I cant stay here doing nothing another hour
The five nights gone Ive watched under her windows but theres the whole of the day
Shes her own horse and little cart ands free to be driving through the town and country as she pleases
If any evil comes to her through Black Jack it comes from her angellike goodness to me
Somewhere hes hiding
Somewhere he is waiting his chance
Somewhere he is reaching out for her
I tell you I cannot I dare not be bearing it longer
Freckles be quiet
said McLean his eyes humid and his voice quivering with the pity of it all
Believe me I did not understand
I know the Angels father well
I will go to him at once
I have transacted business with him for the past three years
I will make him see
I am only beginning to realize your agony and the real danger there is for the Angel
Believe me I will see that she is fully protected every hour of the day and night until Jack is located and disposed of
And I promise you further that if I fail to move her father or make him understand the danger I will maintain a guard over her until Jack is caught
Now will you go bathe drink some milk go to bed and sleep for hours and then be my brave bright old boy again
Yis said Freckles simply
But McLean could see the flesh was twitching on the lads bones
What was it the guard brought there
McLean asked in an effort to distract Freckles thoughts
Oh
Freckles said glancing where the Boss pointed I forgot it
Tis an otter and fine past believing for this warm weather
I shot it at the creek this morning
Twas a good shot considering
I expected to miss
Freckles picked up the animal and started toward McLean with it but Nellie pricked up her dainty little ears danced into the swale and snorted with fright
Freckles dropped the otter and ran to her head
For pitys sake get her on the trail sir he begged
Shes just about where the old king rattler crosses to go into the swampthe old buster Duncan and I have been telling you of
I havent a doubt but it was the one Mother Duncan met
Twas down the trail there just a little farther on that I found her and its sure to be close yet
McLean slid from Nellies back led her into the trail farther down the line and tied her to a bush
Then he went to examine the otter
It was a rare big specimen with exquisitely fine long silky hair
What do you want to do with it Freckles
asked McLean as he stroked the soft fur lingeringly
Do you know that it is very valuable
I was for almost praying so sir said Freckles
As I saw it coming up the bank I thought this Once somewhere in a book there was a picture of a young girl and she was just a breath like the beautifulness of the Angel
Her hands were in a muff as big as her body and I thought it was so pretty
I think she was some queen or the like
Do you suppose I could have this skin tanned and made into such a muff as thatan enormous big one sir
Of course you can said McLean
Thats a fine idea and its easy enough
We must box and express the otter cold storage by the first train
You stand guard a minute and Ill tell Hall to carry it to the cabin
Ill put Nellie to Duncans rig and well drive to town and call on the Angels father
Then well start the otter while it is fresh and Ill write your instructions later
It would be a mighty fine thing for you to give to the Angel as a little reminder of the Limberlost before it is despoiled and as a souvenir of her trip for you
Freckles lifted a face with a glow of happy color creeping into it and eyes lighting with a former brightness
Throwing his arms around McLean he cried Oh how I love you
Oh I wish I could make you know how I love you
McLean strained him to his breast
God bless you Freckles he said
I do know
Were going to have some good old times out of this world together and we cant begin too soon
Would you rather sleep first or have a bite of lunch take the drive with me and then rest
I dont know but sleep will come sooner and deeper to take the ride and have your mind set at ease before you lie down
Suppose you go
Suppose I do said Freckles with a glimmer of the old light in his eyes and newly found strength to shoulder the otter
Together they turned into the trail
McLean noticed and spoke of the big black chickens
Theyve been hanging round out there for several days past said Freckles
Ill tell you what I think it means
I think the old rattler has killed something too big for him to swallow and hes keeping guard and wont let me chickens have it
Im just sure from the way the birds have acted out there all summer that it is the rattlers den
You watch them now
See the way they dip and then rise frightened like
Suddenly McLean turned toward him with blanching face Freckles
he cried
My God sir
shuddered Freckles
He dropped the otter caught up his club and plunged into the swale
Reaching for his revolver McLean followed
The chickens circled higher at their coming and the big snake lifted his head and rattled angrily
It sank in sinuous coils at the report of McLeans revolver and together he and Freckles stood beside Black Jack
His fate was evident and most horrible
Come said the Boss at last
We dont dare touch him
We will get a sheet from Mrs Duncan and tuck over him to keep these swarms of insects away and set Hall on guard while we find the officers
Freckles lips closed resolutely
He deliberately thrust his club under Black Jacks body and raising him rested it on his knee
He pulled a long silver pin from the front of the dead mans shirt and sent it spinning into the swale
Then he gathered up a few crumpled bright flowers and dropped them into the pool far away
My soul is sick with the horror of this thing said McLean as he and Freckles drove toward town
I cant understand how Jack dared risk creeping through the swale even in desperation
No one knew its dangers better than he
And why did he choose the rankest muckiest place to cross the swamp
Dont you think sir it was because it was on a line with the Limberlost south of the corduroy
The grass was tallest there and he counted on those willows to screen him
Once he got among them he would have been safe to walk by stooping
If hed made it past that place hed been sure to get out
Well Im as sorry for Jack as I know how to be said McLean but I cant help feeling relieved that our troubles are over for now they are
With so dreadful a punishment for Jack Wessner under arrest and warrants for the others we can count on their going away and remaining
As for anyone else I dont think they will care to attempt stealing my timber after the experience of these men
There is no other man here with Jacks fine ability in woodcraft
He was an expert
Did you ever hear of anyone who ever tried to locate any trees excepting him
asked Freckles
No I never did said McLean
I am sure there was no one besides him
You see it was only with the arrival of our company that the other fellows scented good stuff in the Limberlost and tried to work in
Jack knew the swamp better than anyone here
When he found there were two companies trying to lease he wanted to stand in with the one from which he could realize the most
Even then he had trees marked that he was trying to dispose of
I think his sole intention in forcing me to discharge him from my gang was to come here and try to steal timber
We had no idea when we took the lease what a gold mine it was
Thats exactly what Wessner said that first day said Freckles eagerly
That twas a gold mine
He said he didnt know where the marked trees were but he knew a man who did and if I would hold off and let them get the marked ones there were a dozen they could get out in a few days
Freckles
cried McLean
You dont mean a dozen
Thats what he said sira dozen
He said they couldnt tell how the grain of all of them would work up of course but they were all worth taking out and five or six were real gold mines
This makes three theyve tried so there must be nine more marked and several of them for being just fine
Well I wish I knew which they are said McLean so I could get them out first
I have been thinking said Freckles
I believe if you will leave one of the guards on the linesay Hallthat I will begin on the swamp at the north end and lay it off in sections and try to hunt out the marked trees
I suppose they are all marked something like that first maple on the line was
Wessner mentioned another good one not so far from that
He said it was best of all
Id be having the swelled head if I could find that
Of course I dont know a thing about the trees but I could hunt for the marks
Jack was so good at it he could tell some of them by the bark but all he wanted to take that weve found so far have just had a deep chip cut out rather low down and where the bushes were thick over it
I believe I could be finding some of them
Good head
said McLean
We will do that
You may begin as soon as you are rested
And about things you come across in the swamp Frecklesthe most trifling little thing that you think the Bird Woman would want take your wheel and go after her at any time
Ill leave two men on the line so that you will have one on either side and you can come and go as you please
Have you stopped to think of all we owe her my boy
Yis and the Angelwe owe her a lot too said Freckles
I owe her me life and honor
Its lying awake nights Ill have to be trying to think how Im ever to pay her up
Well begin with the muff suggested McLean
That should be fine
He bent down and ruffled the rich fur of the otter lying at his feet
I dont exactly see how it comes to be in such splendid fur in summer
Their coats are always thick in cold weather but this scarcely could be improved
Ill wire Cooper to be watching for it
They must have it fresh
When its tanned we wont spare any expense in making it up
It should be a royal thing and some way I think it will exactly suit the Angel
I cant think of anything that would be more appropriate for her
Neither can I agreed Freckles heartily
When I reach the city theres one other thing if Ive the money after the muff is finished
He told McLean of Mrs Duncans desire for a hat similar to the Angels
He hesitated a little in the telling keeping sharp watch on McLeans face
When he saw the Bosss eyes were full of comprehension and sympathy he loved him anew for as ever McLean was quick to understand
Instead of laughing he said I think youll have to let me in on that too
You mustnt be selfish you know
Ill tell you what well do
Send it for Christmas
Ill be home then and we can fill a box
You get the hat
Ill add a dress and wrap
You buy Duncan a hat and gloves
Ill send him a big overcoat and well put in a lot of little stuff for the babies
Wont that be fun
Freckles fairly shivered with delight
That would be away too serious for fun he said
That would be heavenly
How long will it be
He began counting the time and McLean deliberately set himself to encourage Freckles and keep his thoughts from the trouble of the past few days for he had been overwrought and needed quiet and rest
CHAPTER XV Wherein Freckles and the Angel Try Taking a Picture and Little Chicken Furnishes the Subject A week later everything at the Limberlost was precisely as it had been before the tragedy except the case in Freckles room now rested on the stump of the newly felled tree
Enough of the vines were left to cover it prettily and every vestige of the havoc of a few days before was gone
New guards were patrolling the trail
Freckles was roughly laying off the swamp in sections and searching for marked trees
In that time he had found one deeply chipped and the chip cunningly replaced and tacked in
It promised to be quite rare so he was jubilant
He also found so many subjects for the Bird Woman that her coming was of almost daily occurrence and the hours he spent with her and the Angel were nothing less than golden
The Limberlost was now arrayed as the Queen of Sheba in all her glory
The first frosts of autumn had bejewelled her crown in flashing topaz ruby and emerald
Around her feet trailed the purple of her garments while in her hand was her golden scepter
Everything was at full tide
It seemed as if nothing could grow lovelier and it was all standing still a few weeks waiting coming destruction
The swamp was palpitant with life
Every pair of birds that had flocked to it in the spring was now multiplied by from two to ten
The young were tame from Freckles triparenthood and so plump and sleek that they were quite as beautiful as their elders even if in many cases they lacked their brilliant plumage
It was the same story of increase everywhere
There were chubby little groundhogs scudding on the trail
There were cunning baby coons and opossums peeping from hollow logs and trees
Young muskrats followed their parents across the lagoons
If you could come upon a family of foxes that had not yet disbanded and see the young playing with a wild ducks carcass that their mother had brought and note the pride and satisfaction in her eyes as she lay at one side guarding them it would be a picture not to be forgotten
Freckles never tired of studying the devotion of a fox mother to her babies
To him whose early life had been so embittered by continual proof of neglect and cruelty in human parents toward their children the love of these furred and feathered folk of the Limberlost was even more of a miracle than to the Bird Woman and the Angel
The Angel liked the baby rabbits and squirrels
Earlier in the season when the young were yet very small it so happened that at times Freckles could give into her hands one of these little ones
Then it was pure joy to stand back and watch her heaving breast flushed cheek and shining eyes
Hers were such lovely eyes
Freckles had discovered lately that they were not so dark as he had thought them at first but that the length and thickness of lash by which they were shaded made them appear darker than they really were
They were forever changing
Now sparkling and darkling with wit now humid with sympathy now burning with the fire of courage now taking on strength of color with ambition now flashing indignantly at the abuse of any creature
She had carried several of the squirrel and bunny babies home and had littered the conservatory with them
Her care of them was perfect
She was learning her natural history from nature and having much healthful exercise
To her they were the most interesting of all but the Bird Woman preferred the birds with a close second in the moths and butterflies
Brown butterfly time had come
The edge of the swale was filled with milkweed and other plants beloved of them and the air was golden with the flashing satin wings of the monarch viceroy and argynnis
They outnumbered those of any other color three to one
Among the birds it really seemed as if the little yellow fellows were in the preponderance
At least they were until the redwinged blackbirds and bobolinks that had nested on the upland suddenly saw in the swamp the garden of the Lord and came swarming by hundreds to feast and adventure upon it these last few weeks before migration
Never was there a finer feast spread for the birds
The grasses were filled with seeds so too were weeds of every variety
Fall berries were ripe
Wild grapes and black haws were ready
Bugs were creeping everywhere
The muck was yeasty with worms
Insects filled the air
Nature made glorious pause for holiday before her next change and by none of the frequenters of the swamp was this more appreciated than by the big black chickens
They seemed to feel the new reign of peace and fullness most of all
As for food they did not even have to hunt for themselves these days for the feasts now being spread before Little Chicken were more than he could use and he was glad to have his parents come down and help him
He was a fine big overgrown fellow and his wings with quills of jetty black gleaming with bronze were so strong they almost lifted his body
He had three inches of tail and his beak and claws were sharp
His muscles began to clamor for exercise
He raced the forty feet of his home back and forth many times every hour of the day
After a few days of that he began lifting and spreading his wings and flopping them until the down on his back was filled with elm fiber
Then he commenced jumping
The funny little hops springs and sidewise bounds he gave set Freckles and the Angel hidden in the swamp watching him into smothered chuckles of delight
Sometimes he fell to coquetting with himself and that was the funniest thing of all for he turned his head up down from side to side and drew in his chin with prinky little jerks and tilts
He would stretch his neck throw up his head turn it to one side and smirkactually smirk the most complacent and selfsatisfied smirk that anyone ever saw on the face of a bird
It was so comical that Freckles and the Angel told the Bird Woman of it one day
When she finished her work on Little Chicken she left them the camera ready for use telling them they might hide in the bushes and watch
If Little Chicken came out and truly smirked and they could squeeze the bulb at the proper moment to snap him she would be more than delighted
Freckles and the Angel quietly curled beside a big log and with eager eyes and softest breathing they patiently waited but Little Chicken had feasted before they told of his latest accomplishment
He was tired and sleepy so he went into the log to bed and for an hour he never stirred
They were becoming anxious for the light soon would be gone and they had so wanted to try for the picture
At last Little Chicken lifted his head opened his beak and gaped widely
He dozed a minute or two more
The Angel said that was his beauty sleep
Then he lazily gaped again and stood up stretching and yawning
He ambled leisurely toward the gateway and the Angel said Now we may have a chance at last
I do hope so shivered Freckles
With one accord they arose to their knees and trained their eyes on the mouth of the log
The light was full and strong
Little Chicken prospected again with no results
He dressed his plumage polished his beak and when he felt fine and in full toilet he began to flirt with himself
Freckles eyes snapped and his breath sucked between his clenched teeth
Hes going to do it
whispered the Angel
That will come next
Youll best give me that bulb
Yis assented Freckles but he was looking at the log and he made no move to relinquish the bulb
Little Chicken nodded daintily and ruffled his feathers
He gave his head sundry little sidewise jerks and rapidly shifted his point of vision
Once there was the fleeting little ghost of a smirk
NowNo
snapped the Angel
Freckles leaned toward the bird
Tensely he waited
Unconsciously the hand of the Angel clasped his
He scarcely knew it was there
Suddenly Little Chicken sprang straight in the air and landed with a thud
The Angel started slightly but Freckles was immovable
Then as if in approval of his last performance the big overgrown baby wheeled until he was more than threequarters almost full side toward the camera straightened on his legs squared his shoulders stretched his neck full height drew in his chin and smirked his most pronounced smirk directly in the face of the lens
Freckles fingers closed on the bulb convulsively and the Angels closed on his at the instant
Then she heaved a great sigh of relief and lifted her hands to push back the damp clustering hair from her face
How soon do you spose it will be finished
came Freckles strident whisper
For the first time the Angel looked at him
He was on his knees leaning forward his eyes directed toward the bird the perspiration running in little streams down his red mosquitobitten face
His hat was awry his bright hair rampant his breast heaving with excitement while he yet gripped the bulb with every ounce of strength in his body
Do you think we were for getting it
he asked
The Angel could only nod
Freckles heaved a deep sigh of relief
Well if that aint the hardest work I ever did in me life
he exclaimed
Its no wonder the Bird Womans for coming out of the swamp looking as if shes been through a fire a flood and a famine if thats what she goes through day after day
But if you think we got it why its worth all it took and Im glad as ever you are sure
They put the holders in the case carefully closed the camera set it in also and carried it to the road
Then Freckles exulted
Now lets be telling the Bird Woman about it
he shouted wildly dancing and swinging his hat
We got it
We got it
I bet a farm we got it
Hand in hand they ran to the north end of the swamp yelling We got it
like young Comanches and never gave a thought to what they might do until a big bluegray bird with long neck and trailing legs arose on flapping wings and sailed over the Limberlost
The Angel became white to the lips and gripped Freckles with both hands
He gulped with mortification and turned his back
To frighten her subject away carelessly
It was the head crime in the Bird Womans category
She extended her hands as she arose baked blistered and dripping and exclaimed Bless you my children
Bless you
And it truly sounded as if she meant it
Why why stammered the bewildered Angel
Freckles hurried into the breach
You must be for blaming it every bit on me
I was thinking we got Little Chickens picture real good
I was so drunk with the joy of it I lost all me senses and Lets run tell the Bird Woman says I
Like a fool I was for running and I sort of dragged the Angel along
Oh Freckles
expostulated the Angel
Are you loony
Of course it was all my fault
Ive been with her hundreds of times
I knew perfectly well that I wasnt to let anythingNOT ANYTHINGscare her bird away
I was so crazy I forgot
The blame is all mine and shell never forgive me
She will too
cried Freckles
Wasnt you for telling me that very first day that when people scared her birds away she just killed them
Its all me foolishness and Ill never forgive meself
The Bird Woman plunged into the swale at the mouth of Sleepy Snake Creek and came wading toward them with a couple of cameras and dripping tripods
If you will permit me a word my infants she said I will explain to you that I have had three shots at that fellow
The Angel heaved a deep sigh of relief and Freckles face cleared a little
Two of them continued the Bird Woman in the rushesone facing crest lowered one light on back crest flared and the last on wing when you came up
I simply had been praying for something to make him arise from that side so that he would fly toward the camera for he had waded around until in my position I couldnt do it myself
See
Behold in yourselves the answer to the prayers of the longsuffering
Freckles took a step toward her
Are you really meaning that
he asked wonderingly
Only think Angel we did the right thing
She wont lose her picture through the carelessness of us when shes waited and soaked nearly two hours
Shes not angry with us
Never was in a sweeter temper in my life said the Bird Woman busily cleaning and packing the cameras
Freckles removed his hat and solemnly held out his hand
With equal solemnity the Angel grasped it
The Bird Woman laughed alone for to them the situation had been too serious to develop any of the elements of fun
Then they loaded the carriage and the Bird Woman and the Angel started for their homes
It had been a difficult time for all of them so they were very tired but they were joyful
Freckles was so happy it seemed to him that life could hold little more
As the Bird Woman was ready to drive away he laid his hand on the lines and looked into her face
Do you suppose we got it
he asked so eagerly that she would have given much to be able to say yes with conviction
Why my dear I dont know she said
Ive no way to judge
If you made the exposure just before you came to me there was yet a fine light
If you waited until Little Chicken was close the entrance you should have something good even if you didnt catch just the fleeting expression for which you hoped
Of course I cant say surely but I think there is every reason to believe that you have it all right
I will develop the plate tonight make you a proof from it early in the morning and bring it when we come
Its only a question of a day or two now until the gang arrives
I want to work in all the studies I can before that time for they are bound to disturb the birds
Mr McLean will need you then and I scarcely see how we are to do without you
Moved by an impulse she never afterward regretted she bent and laid her lips on Freckles forehead kissing him gently and thanking him for his many kindnesses to her in her loved work
Freckles started away so happy that he felt inclined to keep watching behind to see if the trail were not curling up and rolling down the line after him
CHAPTER XVI Wherein the Angel Locates a Rare Tree and Dines with the Gang From afar Freckles saw them coming
The Angel was standing waving her hat
He sprang on his wheel and raced jolting and pounding down the corduroy to meet them
The Bird Woman stopped the horse and the Angel gave him the bit of print paper
Freckles leaned the wheel against a tree and took the proof with eager fingers
He never before had seen a study from any of his chickens
He stood staring
When he turned his face toward them it was transfigured with delight
You see
he exclaimed and began gazing again
Oh me Little Chicken
he cried
Oh me ilegant Little Chicken
Id be giving all me money in the bank for you
Then he thought of the Angels muff and Mrs Duncans hat and added or at least all but what Im needing bad for something else
Would you mind stopping at the cabin a minute and showing this to Mother Duncan
he asked
Give me that little book in your pocket said the Bird Woman
She folded the outer edges of the proof so that it would fit into the book explaining as she did so its perishable nature in that state
Freckles went hurrying ahead and they arrived in time to see Mrs Duncan gazing as if awestruck and to hear her bewildered Weel I be drawed on
Freckles and the Angel helped the Bird Woman to establish herself for a long day at the mouth of Sleepy Snake Creek
Then she sent them away and waited what luck would bring to her
Now what shall we do
inquired the Angel who was a bundle of nerves and energy
Would you like to go to me room awhile
asked Freckles
If you dont care to very much Id rather not said the Angel
Ill tell you
Lets go help Mrs Duncan with dinner and play with the baby
I love a nice clean baby
They started toward the cabin
Every few minutes they stopped to investigate something or to chatter over some natural history wonder
The Angel had quick eyes she seemed to see everything but Freckles were even quicker for life itself had depended on their sharpness ever since the beginning of his work at the swamp
They saw it at the same time
Someone has been making a flagpole said the Angel running the toe of her shoe around the stump evidently made that season
Freckles what would anyone cut a tree as small as that for
I dont know said Freckles
Well but I want to know
said the Angel
No one came away here and cut it for fun
Theyve taken it away
Lets go back and see if we can see it anywhere around there
She turned retraced her footsteps and began eagerly searching
Freckles did the same
There it is
he exclaimed at last leaning against the trunk of that big maple
Yes and leaning there has killed a patch of dried bark said the Angel
See how dried it appears
Freckles stared at her
Angel
he shouted I bet you its a marked tree
Course it is
cried the Angel
No one would cut that sapling and carry it away there and lean it up for nothing
Ill tell you
This is one of Jacks marked trees
Hes climbed up there above anyones head peeled the bark and cut into the grain enough to be sure
Then hes laid the bark back and fastened it with that pole to mark it
You see therere a lot of other big maples close around it
Can you climb to that place
Yes said Freckles if I take off my wadingboots I can
Then take them off said the Angel and do hurry
Cant you see that I am almost crazy to know if this tree is a marked one
When they pushed the sapling over a piece of bark as big as the crown of Freckles hat fell away
I believe it looks kind of nubby encouraged the Angel backing away with her face all screwed into a twist in an effort to intensify her vision
Freckles reached the opening then slid rapidly to the ground
He was almost breathless while his eyes were flashing
The barks been cut clean with a knife the sap scraped away and a big chip taken out deep
The trunk is the twistiest thing you ever saw
Its full of eyes as a bird is of feathers
The Angel was dancing and shaking his hand
Oh Freckles she cried Im so delighted that you found it
But I didnt said the astonished Freckles
That tree isnt my find its yours
I forgot it and was going on you wouldnt give up and kept talking about it and turned back
You found it
Youd best be looking after your reputation for truth and veracity said the Angel
You know you saw that sapling first
Yes after you took me back and set me looking for it scoffed Freckles
The clear ringing echo of strongly swung axes came crashing through the Limberlost
Tis the gang
shouted Freckles
Theyre clearing a place to make the camp
Lets go help
Hadnt we better mark that tree again
cautioned the Angel
Its away in here
Theres such a lot of them and all so much alike
Wed feel good and green to find it and then lose it
Freckles lifted the sapling to replace it but the Angel motioned him away
Use your hatchet she said
I predict this is the most valuable tree in the swamp
You found it
Im going to play that youre my knight
Now you nail my colors on it
She reached up and pulling a blue bow from her hair untied and doubled it against the tree
Freckles turned his eyes from her and managed the fastening with shaking fingers
The Angel had called him her knight
Dear Lord how he loved her
She must not see his face or surely her quick eyes would read what he was fighting to hide
He did not dare lay his lips on that ribbon then but that night he would return to it
When they had gone a little distance they both looked back and the morning breeze set the bit of blue waving them a farewell
They walked at a rapid pace
I am sorry about scaring the birds said the Angel but its almost time for them to go anyway
I feel dreadfully over having the swamp ruined but isnt it a delight to hear the good honest ring of those axes instead of straining your ears for stealthy sounds
Isnt it fine to go openly and freely with nothing worse than a snake or a poisonvine to fear
Ah
said Freckles with a long breath its better than you can dream Angel
Nobody will ever be guessing some of the things Ive been through trying to keep me promise to the Boss and to hold out until this day
That its come with only one fresh stump and the log from that saved and this new tree to report isnt it grand
Maybe Mr McLean will be forgetting that stump when he sees this tree Angel
He cant forget it said the Angel and in answer to Freckles startled eyes she added because he never had any reason to remember it
He couldnt have done a whit better himself
My father says so
Youre all right Freckles
She reached him her hand and as two children they broke into a run when they came closer the gang
They left the swamp by the west road and followed the trail until they found the men
To the Angel it seemed complete charm
In the shadiest spot on the west side of the line at the edge of the swamp and very close Freckles room they were cutting bushes and clearing space for a big tent for the mens sleepingquarters another for a dininghall and a board shack for the cook
The teamsters were unloading the horses were cropping leaves from the bushes while each man was doing his part toward the construction of the new Limberlost quarters
Freckles helped the Angel climb on a wagonload of canvas in the shade
She removed her leggings wiped her heated face and glowed with happiness and interest
The gang had been sifted carefully
McLean now felt that there was not a man in it who was not trustworthy
They all had heard of the Angels plucky ride for Freckles relief several of them had been in the rescue party
Others new since that time had heard the tale rehearsed in its every aspect around the smudgefires at night
Almost all of them knew the Angel by sight from her trips with the Bird Woman to their leases
They all knew her father her position and the luxuries of her home
Whatever course she had chosen with them they scarcely would have resented it but the Angel never had been known to choose a course
Her spirit of friendliness was inborn and inbred
She loved everyone so she sympathized with everyone
Her generosity was only limited by what was in her power to give
She came down the trail hand in hand with the redhaired freckled timber guard whom she had worn herself past the limit of endurance to save only a few weeks before racing in her eagerness to reach them and laughing her Good morning gentlemen right and left
When she was ensconced on the wagonload of tenting she sat on a roll of canvas as a queen on her throne
There was not a man of the gang who did not respect her
She was a living exponent of universal brotherhood
There was no man among them who needed her exquisite face or dainty clothing to teach him that the deference due a gentlewoman should be paid her
That the spirit of good fellowship she radiated levied an especial tribute of its own and it became their delight to honor and please her
As they raced toward the wagonLet me tell about the tree please
she begged Freckles
Why sure
said Freckles
He probably would have said the same to anything she suggested
When McLean came he found the Angel flushed and glowing sitting on the wagon her hands already filled
One of the men who was cutting a scruboak had carried to her a handful of crimson leaves
Another had gathered a bunch of delicate marshgrass heads for her
Someone else in taking out a bush had found a daintily built and lined little nest fresh as when made
She held up her treasures and greeted McLean Good morning Mr Boss of the Limberlost
The gang shouted while he bowed profoundly before her
Everyone listen
cried the Angel climbing a roll of canvas
I have something to say
Freckles has been guarding here over a year now and he presents the Limberlost to you with every tree in it saved for good measure he has this morning located the rarest one of them all the one in from the east line that Wessner spoke of the first daynearest the one you took out
All together
Everyone
Hurrah for Freckles
With flushing cheeks and gleaming eyes gaily waving the grass above her head she led in three cheers and a tiger
Freckles slipped into the swamp and hid himself for fear he could not conceal his pride and his great surging throbbing love for her
The Angel subsided on the canvas and explained to McLean about the maple
The Boss was mightily pleased
He took Freckles and set out to relocate and examine the tree
The Angel was interested in the making of the camp so she preferred to remain with the men
With her sharp eyes she was watching every detail of construction but when it came to the stretching of the dininghall canvas she proceeded to take command
The men were driving the ropepins when the Angel arose on the wagon and leaning forward spoke to Duncan who was directing the work
I believe if you will swing that around a few feet farther you will find it better Mr Duncan she said
That way will let the hot sun in at noon while the sides will cut off the best breeze
Thats a fact said Duncan studying the conditions
So by shifting the pins a little they obtained comfort for which they blessed the Angel every day
When they came to the sleepingtent they consulted her about that
She explained the general direction of the night breeze and indicated the best position for the tent
Before anyone knew how it happened the Angel was standing on the wagon directing the location and construction of the cookingshack the erection of the crane for the big boilingpots and the building of the storeroom
She superintended the laying of the floor of the sleepingtent lengthwise So that it would be easier to sweep and suggested a new arrangement of the cots that would afford all the men an equal share of night breeze
She left the wagon and climbing on the newly erected diningtable advised with the cook in placing his stove table and kitchen utensils
When Freckles returned from the tree to join in the work around the camp he caught glimpses of her enthroned on a soapbox cleaning beans
She called to him that they were invited for dinner and that they had accepted the invitation
When the beans were steaming in the pot the Angel advised the cook to soak them overnight the next time so that they would cook more quickly and not burst
She was sure their cook at home did that way and the CHEF of the gang thought it would be a good idea
The next Freckles saw of her she was paring potatoes
A little later she arranged the table
She swept it with a broom instead of laying a cloth took the hatchet and hammered the deepest dents from the tin plates and nearly skinned her fingers scouring the tinware with rushes
She set the plates an even distance apart and laid the forks and spoons beside them
When the cook threw away half a dozen fruitcans she gathered them up and melted off the tops although she almost blistered her face and quite blistered her fingers doing it
Then she neatly covered these improvised vases with the Manila paper from the groceries tying it with wisps of marshgrass
These she filled with fringed gentians blazingstar asters goldenrod and ferns placing them the length of the diningtable
In one of the end cans she arranged her red leaves and in the other the fancy grass
Two men watching her went away proud of themselves and said that she was a born lady
She laughingly caught up a paper bag and fitted it jauntily to her head in imitation of a cooks cap
Then she ground the coffee and beat a couple of eggs to put in because there is company she gravely explained to the cook
She asked that delighted individual if he did not like it best that way and he said he did not know because he never had a chance to taste it
The Angel said that was her case exactlyshe never had either she was not allowed anything stronger than milk
Then they laughed together
She told the cook about camping with her father and explained that he made his coffee that way
When the steam began to rise from the big boiler she stuffed the spout tightly with clean marshgrass to keep the aroma in placed the boiler where it would only simmer and explained why
The influence of the Angels visit lingered with the cook through the remainder of his life while the men prayed for her frequent return
She was having a happy time when McLean came back jubilant from his trip to the tree
How jubilant he told only the Angel for he had been obliged to lose faith in some trusted men of late and had learned discretion by what he suffered
He planned to begin clearing out a road to the tree that same afternoon and to set two guards every night for it promised to be a rare treasure so he was eager to see it on the way to the mills
I am coming to see it felled cried the Angel
I feel a sort of motherly interest in that tree
McLean was highly amused
He would have staked his life on the honesty of either the Angel or Freckles yet their versions of the finding of the tree differed widely
Tell me Angel the Boss said jestingly
I think I have a right to know
Who really did locate that tree
Freckles she answered promptly and emphatically
But he says quite as positively that it was you
I dont understand
The Angels legal look flashed into her face
Her eyes grew tense with earnestness
She glanced around and seeing no towel or basin held out her hand for Sears to pour water over them
Then using the skirt of her dress to dry them she climbed on the wagon
Ill tell you word for word how it happened she said and then you shall decide and Freckles and I will agree with you
When she had finished her version Tell us oh most learned judge
she laughingly quoted which of us located that tree
Blest if I know who located it
exclaimed McLean
But I have a fairly accurate idea as to who put the blue ribbon on it
The Boss smiled significantly at Freckles who just had come for they had planned that they would instruct the company to reserve enough of the veneer from that very tree to make the most beautiful dressing table they could design for the Angels share of the discovery
What will you have for yours
McLean had asked of Freckles
If its all the same to you Ill be taking mine out in music lessons begging your pardonvoice culture said Freckles with a grimace
McLean laughed for Freckles needed to see or hear only once to absorb learning as the thirsty earth sucks up water
The Angel placed McLean at the head of the table
She took the foot with Freckles on her right while the lumber gang washed brushed and straightened until they felt unfamiliar with themselves and each other filled the sides
That imposed a slight constraint
Then too the men were afraid of the flowers the polished tableware and above all of the dainty grace of the Angel
Nowhere do men so display lack of good breeding and culture as in dining
To sprawl on the table scoop with their knives chew loudly gulp coffee and duck their heads as snappingturtles for every bite had not been noticed by them until the Angel sitting straightly suddenly made them remember that they too were possessed of spines
Instinctively every man at the table straightened
CHAPTER XVII Wherein Freckles Offers His Life for His Love and Gets a Broken Body To reach the tree was a more difficult task than McLean had supposed
The gang could approach nearest on the outside toward the east but after they reached the end of the east entrance there was yet a mile of most impenetrable thicket trees big and little and bushes of every variety and stage of growth
In many places the muck had to be filled to give the horses and wagons a solid foundation over which to haul heavy loads
It was several days before they completed a road to the noble big tree and were ready to fell it
When the sawing began Freckles was watching down the road where it met the trail leading from Little Chickens tree
He had gone to the tree ahead of the gang to remove the blue ribbon
Carefully folded it now lay over his heart
He was promising himself much comfort with that ribbon when he would leave for the city next month to begin his studies and dream the summer over again
It would help to make things tangible
When he was dressed as other men and at his work he knew where he meant to home that precious bit of blue
It should be his goodluck token and he would wear it always to keep bright in memory the day on which the Angel had called him her knight
How he would study and oh how he would sing
If only he could fulfill McLeans expectations and make the Angel proud of him
If only he could be a real knight
He could not understand why the Angel had failed to come
She had wanted to see their tree felled
She would be too late if she did not arrive soon
He had told her it would be ready that morning and she had said she surely would be there
Why of all mornings was she late on this
McLean had ridden to town
If he had been there Freckles would have asked that they delay the felling but he scarcely liked to ask the gang
He really had no authority although he thought the men would wait but some way he found such embarrassment in framing the request that he waited until the work was practically ended
The saw was out and the men were cutting into the felling side of the tree when the Boss rode in
His first word was to inquire for the Angel
When Freckles said she had not yet come the Boss at once gave orders to stop work on the tree until she arrived for he felt that she virtually had located it and if she desired to see it felled she should
As the men stepped back a stiff morning breeze caught the top that towered high above its fellows
There was an ominous grinding at the base a shiver of the mighty trunk then directly in line of its fall the bushes swung apart and the laughing face of the Angel looked on them
A groan of horror burst from the dry throats of the men and reading the agony in their faces she stopped short glanced up and understood
South
shouted McLean
Run south
The Angel was helpless
It was apparent that she did not know which way south was
There was another slow shiver of the big tree
The remainder of the gang stood motionless but Freckles sprang past the trunk and went leaping in big bounds
He caught up the Angel and dashed through the thicket for safety
The swaying trunk was half over when for an instant a nearby tree stayed its fall
They saw Freckles foot catch and with the Angel he plunged headlong
A terrible cry broke from the men while McLean covered his face
Instantly Freckles was up with the Angel in his arms struggling on
The outer limbs were on them when they saw Freckles hurl the Angel face down in the muck as far from him as he could send her
Springing after in an attempt to cover her body with his own he whirled to see if they were yet in danger and with outstretched arms braced himself for the shock
The branches shut them from sight and the awful crash rocked the earth
McLean and Duncan ran with axes and saws
The remainder of the gang followed and they worked desperately
It seemed a long time before they caught a glimpse of the Angels blue dress but it renewed their vigor
Duncan fell on his knees beside her and tore the muck from underneath her with his hands
In a few seconds he dragged her out choking and stunned but surely not fatally hurt
Freckles lay a little farther under the tree a big limb pinning him down
His eyes were wide open
He was perfectly conscious
Duncan began mining beneath him but Freckles stopped him
You cant be moving me he said
You must cut off the limb and lift it
I know
Two men ran for the big saw
A number of them laid hold of the limb and bore up
In a short time it was removed and Freckles lay free
The men bent over to lift him but he motioned them away
Dont be touching me until I rest a bit he pleaded
Then he twisted his head until he saw the Angel who was wiping muck from her eyes and face on the skirt of her dress
Try to get up he begged
McLean laid hold of the Angel and helped her to her feet
Do you think any bones are broken
gasped Freckles
The Angel shook her head and wiped muck
You see if you can find any sir Freckles commanded
The Angel yielded herself to McLeans touch and he assured Freckles that she was not seriously injured
Freckles settled back a smile of ineffable tenderness on his face
Thank the Lord
he hoarsely whispered
The Angel leaned toward him
Now Freckles you
she cried
Its your turn
Please get up
A pitiful spasm swept Freckles face
The sight of it washed every vestige of color from the Angels
She took hold of his hands
Freckles get up
It was half command half entreaty
Easy Angel easy
Let me rest a bit first
implored Freckles
She knelt beside him
He reached his arm around her and drew her closely
He looked at McLean in an agony of entreaty that brought the Boss to his knees on the other side
Oh Freckles
McLean cried
Not that
Surely we can do something
We must
Let me see
He tried to unfasten Freckles neckband but his fingers shook so clumsily that the Angel pushed them away and herself laid Freckles chest bare
With one hasty glance she gathered the clothing together and slipped her arm under his head
Freckles lifted his eyes of agony to hers
You see
he said
The Angel nodded dumbly
Freckles turned to McLean
Thank you for everything he panted
Where are the boys
They are all here said the Boss except a couple who have gone for doctors Mrs Duncan and the Bird Woman
Its no use trying to do anything said Freckles
You wont forget the muff and the Christmas box
The muff especial
There was a movement above them so pronounced that it attracted Freckles attention even in that extreme hour
He looked up and a pleased smile flickered on his drawn face
Why if it aint me Little Chicken
he cried hoarsely
He must be making his very first trip from the log
Now Duncan can have his big wateringtrough
It was Little Chicken that made me late faltered the Angel
I was so anxious to get here early I forgot to bring his breakfast from the carriage
He must have been hungry for when I passed the log he started after me
He was so wabbly and so slow flying from tree to tree and through the bushes I just had to wait on him for I couldnt drive him back
Of course you couldnt
Me bird has too amazing good sinse to go back when he could be following you exulted Freckles exactly as if he did not realize what the delay had cost him
Then he lay silently thinking but presently he asked slowly And so twas me Little Chicken that was making you late Angel
Yes said the Angel
A spasm of fierce pain shook Freckles and a look of uncertainty crossed his face
All summer Ive been thanking God for the falling of the feather and all the delights its brought me he muttered but this looks as if He stopped short and raised questioning eyes to McLean
I cant help being Irish but I can help being superstitious he said
I mustnt be laying it to the Almighty or to me bird must I
No dear lad said McLean stroking the brilliant hair
The choice lay with you
You could have stood a rooted dolt like all the remainder of us
It was through your great love and your high courage that you made the sacrifice
Dont you be so naming it sir
cried Freckles
Its just the reverse
If I could be giving me body the hundred times over to save hers from this Id be doing it and take joy with every pain
He turned with a smile of adoring tenderness to the Angel
She was ghastly white and her eyes were dull and glazed
She scarcely seemed to hear or understand what was coming but she bravely tried to answer that smile
Is my forehead covered with dirt
he asked
She shook her head
You did once he gasped
Instantly she laid her lips on his forehead then on each cheek and then in a long kiss on his lips
McLean bent over him
Freckles he said brokenly you will never know how I love you
You wont go without saying goodbye to me
That word stung the Angel to quick comprehension
She started as if arousing from sleep
Goodbye
she cried sharply her eyes widening and the color rushing into her white face
Goodbye
Why what do you mean
Whos saying goodbye
Where could Freckles go when he is hurt like this save to the hospital
You neednt say goodbye for that
Of course we will all go with him
You call up the men
We must start right away
Its no use Angel said Freckles
Im thinking ivry bone in me breast is smashed
Youll have to be letting me go
I will not said the Angel flatly
Its no use wasting precious time talking about it
You are alive
You are breathing and no matter how badly your bones are broken what are great surgeons for but to fix you up and make you well again
You promise me that youll just grit your teeth and hang on when we hurt you for we must start with you as quickly as it can be done
I dont know what has been the matter with me
Heres good time wasted already
Oh Angel
moaned Freckles I cant
You dont know how bad it is
Ill die the minute you are for trying to lift me
Of course you will if you make up your mind to do it said the Angel
But if you are determined you wont and set yourself to breathing deep and strong and hang on to me tight I can get you out
Really you must Freckles no matter how it hurts for you did this for me and now I must save you so you might as well promise
She bent over him trying to smile encouragement with her fearstiffened lips
You will promise Freckles
Big drops of cold sweat ran together on Freckles temples
Angel darlin Angel he pleaded taking her hand in his
You aint understanding and I cant for the life of me be telling you but indade its best to be letting me go
This is my chance
Please say goodbye and let me slip off quick
He appealed to McLean
Dear Boss you know
You be telling her that for me living is far worse pain than dying
Tell her you know death is the best thing that could ever be happening to me
Merciful Heaven
burst in the Angel
I cant endure this delay
She caught Freckles hand to her breast and bending over him looked deeply into his stricken eyes
Angel I give you my word of honor that I will keep right on breathing
Thats what you are going to promise me she said
Do you say it
Freckles hesitated
Freckles
imploringly commanded the Angel YOU DO SAY IT
Yis gasped Freckles
The Angel sprang to her feet
Then thats all right she said with a tinge of her old time briskness
You just keep breathing away like a steam engine and I will do all the remainder
The eager men gathered around her
Its going to be a tough pull to get Freckles out she said but its our only chance so listen closely and dont for the lives of you fail me in doing quickly what I tell you
Theres no time to spend falling down over each other we must have some system
You four there get on those wagon horses and ride to the sleepingtent
Get the stoutest cot a couple of comforts and a pillow
Ride back with them some way to save time
If you meet any other men of the gang send them here to help carry the cot
We wont risk the jolt of driving with him
The others clear a path out to the road and Mr McLean you take Nellie and ride to town
Tell my father how Freckles is hurt and that he risked it to save me
Tell him Im going to take Freckles to Chicago on the noon train and I want him to hold it if we are a little late
If he cant then have a special ready at the station and another on the Pittsburgh at Fort Wayne so we can go straight through
You neednt mind leaving us
The Bird Woman will be here soon
We will rest awhile
She dropped into the muck beside Freckles and began stroking his hair and hand
He lay with his face of agony turned to hers and fought to smother the groans that would tell her what he was suffering
When they stood ready to lift him the Angel bent over him in a passion of tenderness
Dear old Limberlost guard were going to lift you now she said
I suspect you will faint from the pain of it but we will be as easy as ever we can and dont you dare forget your promise
A whimsical halfsmile touched Freckles quivering lips
Angel can a man be remembering a promise when he aint knowing
he asked
You can said the Angel stoutly because a promise means so much more to you than it does to most men
A look of strength flashed into Freckles face at her words
I am ready he said
With the first touch his eyes closed a mighty groan was wrenched from him and he lay senseless
The Angel gave Duncan one panic stricken look
Then she set her lips and gathered her forces again
I guess thats a good thing she said
Maybe he wont feel how we are hurting him
Oh boys are you being quick and gentle
She stepped to the side of the cot and bathed Freckles face
Taking his hand in hers she gave the word to start
She told the men to ask every ablebodied man they met to join them so that they could change carriers often and make good time
The Bird Woman insisted upon taking the Angel into the carriage and following the cot but she refused to leave Freckles and suggested that the Bird Woman drive ahead pack them some clothing and be at the station ready to accompany them to Chicago
All the way the Angel walked beside the cot shading Freckles face with a branch and holding his hand
At every pause to change carriers she moistened his face and lips and watched each breath with heartbreaking anxiety
She scarcely knew when her father joined them and taking the branch from her slipped an arm around her waist and almost carried her
To the city streets and the swarm of curious staring faces she paid no more attention than she had to the trees of the Limberlost
When the train came and the gang placed Freckles aboard big Duncan made a place for the Angel beside the cot
With the best physician to be found and with the Bird Woman and McLean in attendance the fourhours run to Chicago began
The Angel constantly watched over Freckles bathed his face stroked his hand and gently fanned him
Not for an instant would she yield her place or allow anyone else to do anything for him
The Bird Woman and McLean regarded her in amazement
There seemed to be no end to her resources and courage
The only time she spoke was to ask McLean if he were sure the special would be ready on the Pittsburgh road
He replied that it was made up and waiting
At five oclock Freckles lay stretched on the operatingtable of Lake View Hospital while three of the greatest surgeons in Chicago bent over him
At their command McLean picked up the unwilling Angel and carried her to the nurses to be bathed have her bruises attended and to be put to bed
In a place where it is difficult to surprise people they were astonished women as they removed the Angels dainty stained and torn clothing drew off hose muckbaked to her limbs soaked the dried loam from her silken hair and washed the beautiful scratched bruised dirtcovered body
The Angel fell fast asleep long before they had finished and lay deeply unconscious while the fight for Freckles life was being waged
Three days later she was the same Angel as of old except that Freckles was constantly in her thoughts
The anxiety and responsibility that she felt for his condition had bred in her a touch of womanliness and authority that was new
That morning she arose early and hovered near Freckles door
She had been allowed to remain with him constantly for the nurses and surgeons had learned with his returning consciousness that for her alone would the active highly strung painracked sufferer be quiet and obey orders
When she was dropping from loss of sleep the threat that she would fall ill had to be used to send her to bed
Then by telling Freckles that the Angel was asleep and they would waken her the moment he moved they were able to control him for a short time
The surgeon was with Freckles
The Angel had been told that the word he brought that morning would be final so she curled in a window seat dropped the curtains behind her and in dire anxiety waited the opening of the door
Just as it unclosed McLean came hurrying down the hall and to the surgeon but with one glance at his face he stepped back in dismay while the Angel who had arisen sank to the seat again too dazed to come forward
The men faced each other
The Angel with parted lips and frightened eyes bent forward in tense anxiety
II thought he was doing nicely
faltered McLean
He bore the operation well replied the surgeon and his wounds are not necessarily fatal
I told you that yesterday but I did not tell you that something else probably would kill him and it will
He need not die from the accident but he will not live the day out
But why
What is it
asked McLean hurriedly
We all dearly love the boy
We have millions among us to do anything that money can accomplish
Why must he die if those broken bones are not the cause
That is what I am going to give you the opportunity to tell me replied the surgeon
He need not die from the accident yet he is dying as fast as his splendid physical condition will permit and it is because he so evidently prefers death to life
If he were full of hope and ambition to live my work would be easy
If all of you love him as you prove you do and there is unlimited means to give him anything he wants why should he desire death
Is he dying
demanded McLean
He is said the surgeon
He will not live this day out unless some strong reaction sets in at once
He is so low that preferring death to life nature cannot overcome his inertia
If he is to live he must be made to desire life
Now he undoubtedly wishes for death and that it come quickly
Then he must die said McLean
His broad shoulders shook convulsively
His strong hands opened and closed mechanically
Does that mean that you know what he desires and cannot or will not supply it
McLean groaned in misery
It means he said desperately that I know what he wants but it is as far removed from my power to help him as it would be to give him a star
The thing for which he will die he can never have
Then you must prepare for the end very shortly said the surgeon turning abruptly away
McLean caught his arm roughly
You look here
he cried in desperation
You say that as if I could do something if I would
I tell you the boy is dear to me past expression
I would do anythingspend any sum
You have noticed and repeatedly commented on the young girl with me
It is that child that he wants
He worships her to adoration and knowing he can never be anything to her he prefers death to life
In Gods name what can I do about it
Barring that missing hand I never examined a finer man said the surgeon and she seemed perfectly devoted to him why cannot he have her
Why
echoed McLean
Why
Well for many reasons
I told you he was my son
You probably knew that he was not
A little over a year ago I never had seen him
He joined one of my lumber gangs from the road
He is a stray left at one of your homes for the friendless here in Chicago
When he grew up the superintendent bound him to a brutal man
He ran away and landed in one of my lumber camps
He has no name or knowledge of legal birth
The Angelwe have talked of her
You see what she is physically and mentally
She has ancestors reaching back to Plymouth Rock and across the sea for generations before that
She is an idolized petted only child and there is great wealth
Life holds everything for her nothing for him
He sees it more plainly than anyone else could
There is nothing for the boy but death if it is the Angel that is required to save him
The Angel stood between them
Well I just guess not
she cried
If Freckles wants me all he has to do is to say so and he can have me
The amazed men stepped back staring at her
That he will never say said McLean at last and you dont understand Angel
I dont know how you came here
I wouldnt have had you hear that for the world but since you have dear girl you must be told that it isnt your friendship or your kindness Freckles wants it is your love
The Angel looked straight into the great surgeons eyes with her clear steady orbs of blue and then into McLeans with unwavering frankness
Well I do love him she said simply
McLeans arms dropped helplessly
You dont understand he reiterated patiently
It isnt the love of a friend or a comrade or a sister that Freckles wants from you it is the love of a sweetheart
And if to save the life he has offered for you you are thinking of being generous and impulsive enough to sacrifice your futurein the absence of your father it will become my plain duty as the protector in whose hands he has placed you to prevent such rashness
The very words you speak and the manner in which you say them prove that you are a mere child and have not dreamed what love is
Then the Angel grew splendid
A rosy flush swept the pallor of fear from her face
Her big eyes widened and dilated with intense lights
She seemed to leap to the height and the dignity of superb womanhood before their wondering gaze
I never have had to dream of love she said proudly
I never have known anything else in all my life but to love everyone and to have everyone love me
And there never has been anyone so dear as Freckles
If you will remember we have been through a good deal together
I do love Freckles just as I say I do
I dont know anything about the love of sweethearts but I love him with all the love in my heart and I think that will satisfy him
Surely it should
muttered the man of knives and lancets
McLean reached to take hold of the Angel but she saw the movement and swiftly stepped back
As for my father she continued he at once told me what he learned from you about Freckles
Ive known all you know for several weeks
That knowledge didnt change your love for him a particle
I think the Bird Woman loved him more
Why should you two have all the fine perceptions there are
Cant I see how brave trustworthy and splendid he is
Cant I see how his soul vibrates with his music his love of beautiful things and the pangs of loneliness and heart hunger
Must you two love him with all the love there is and I give him none
My father is never unreasonable
He wont expect me not to love Freckles or not to tell him so if the telling will save him
She darted past McLean into Freckles room closed the door and turned the key
CHAPTER XVIII Wherein Freckles refuses Love Without Knowledge of Honorable Birth and the Angel Goes in Quest of it Freckles lay on a flat pillow his body immovable in a plaster cast his maimed arm as always hidden
His greedy gaze fastened at once on the Angels face
She crossed to him with light step and bent over him with infinite tenderness
Her heart ached at the change in his appearance
He seemed so weak heart hungry so utterly hopeless so alone
She could see that the night had been one long terror
For the first time she tried putting herself in Freckles place
What would it mean to have no parents no home no name
No name
That was the worst of all
That was to be lostindeedutterly and hopelessly lost
The Angel lifted her hands to her dazed head and reeled as she tried to face that proposition
She dropped on her knees beside the bed slipped her arm under the pillow and leaning over Freckles set her lips on his forehead
He smiled faintly but his wistful face appeared worse for it
It hurt the Angel to the heart
Dear Freckles she said there is a story in your eyes this morning tell me
Freckles drew a long wavering breath
Angel he begged be generous
Be thinking of me a little
Im so homesick and worn out dear Angel be giving me back me promise
Let me go
Why Freckles
faltered the Angel
You dont know what you are asking
Let you go
I cannot
I love you better than anyone Freckles
I think you are the very finest person I ever knew
I have our lives all planned
I want you to be educated and learn all there is to know about singing just as soon as you are well enough
By the time you have completed your education I will have finished college and then I want she choked a second I want you to be my real knight Freckles and come to me and tell me that youlike mea little
I have been counting on you for my sweetheart from the very first Freckles
I cant give you up unless you dont like me
But you do like mejust a littledont you Freckles
Freckles lay whiter than the coverlet his staring eyes on the ceiling and his breath wheezing between dry lips
The Angel awaited his answer a second and when none came she dropped her crimsoning face beside him on the pillow and whispered in his ear Freckles IIm trying to make love to you
Oh cant you help me only a little bit
Its awful hard all alone
I dont know how when I really mean it but Freckles I love you
I must have you and now I guessI guess maybe Id better kiss you next
She lifted her shamed face and bravely laid her feverish quivering lips on his
Her breath like cloverbloom was in his nostrils and her hair touched his face
Then she looked into his eyes with reproach
Freckles she panted Freckles
I didnt think it was in you to be mean
Mean Angel
Mean to you
gasped Freckles
Yes said the Angel
Downright mean
When I kiss you if you had any mercy at all youd kiss back just a little bit
Freckles sinewy fist knotted into the coverlet
His chin pointed ceilingward while his head rocked on the pillow
Oh Jesus
burst from him in agony
You aint the only one that was crucified
The Angel caught Freckles hand and carried it to her breast
Freckles
she wailed in terror Freckles
It is a mistake
Is it that you dont want me
Freckles head rolled on in wordless suffering
Wait a bit Angel
he panted at last
Be giving me a little time
The Angel arose with controlled features
She bathed his face straightened his hair and held water to his lips
It seemed a long time before he reached toward her
Instantly she knelt again carried his hand to her breast and leaned her cheek upon it
Tell me Freckles she whispered softly
If I can said Freckles in agony
Its just this
Angels are from above
Outcasts are from below
Youve a sound body and youre beautifulest of all
You have everything that loving careful raising and money can give you
I have so much less than nothing that I dont suppose I had any right to be born
Its a sure thingnobody wanted me afterward so of course they didnt before
Some of them should have been telling you long ago
If thats all you have to say Freckles Ive known that quite a while said the Angel stoutly
Mr McLean told my father and he told me
That only makes me love you more to pay for all youve missed
Then Im wondering at you said Freckles in a voice of awe
Cant you see that if you were willing and your father would come and offer you to me I couldnt be touching the soles of your feet in loveme whose people brawled over me cut off me hand and throwed me away to freeze and to die
Me who has no name just as much because Ive no RIGHT to any as because I dont know it
When I was little I planned to find me father and mother when I grew up
Now I know me mother deserted me and me father was maybe a thief and surely a liar
The pity for me suffering and the watching over me have gone to your head dear Angel and its me must be thinking for you
If you could be forgetting me lost hand where I was raised and that I had no name to give you and if you would be taking me as I am some day people such as mine must be might come upon you
I used to pray ivery night and morning and many times the day to see me mother
Now I only pray to die quickly and never risk the sight of her
Taint no ways possible Angel
Its a wildness of your dear head
Oh do for mercy sake kiss me once more and be letting me go
Not for a minute
cried the Angel
Not for a minute if those are all the reasons you have
Its you who are wild in your head but I can understand just how it happened
Being shut in that Home most of your life and seeing children every day whose parents did neglect and desert them makes you sure yours did the same and yet there are so many other things that could have happened so much more easily than that
There are thousands of young couples who come to this country and start a family with none of their relatives here
Chicago is a big wicked city and grown people could disappear in many ways and who would there ever be to find to whom their little children belonged
The minute my father told me how you felt I began to study this thing over and Ive made up my mind you are dead wrong
I meant to ask my father or the Bird Woman to talk to you before you went away to school but as matters are right now I guess Ill just do it myself
Its all so plain to me
Oh if I could only make you see
She buried her face in the pillow and presently lifted it transfigured
Now I have it
she cried
Oh dear heart
I can make it so plain
Freckles can you imagine you see the old Limberlost trail
Well when we followed it you know there were places where ugly prickly thistles overgrew the path and you went ahead with your club and bent them back to keep them from stinging through my clothing
Other places there were big shining pools where lovely snowwhite lilies grew and you waded in and gathered them for me
Oh dear heart dont you see
Its this
Everywhere the wind carried that thistledown other thistles sprang up and grew prickles and wherever those lily seeds sank to the mire the pure white of other lilies bloomed
But Freckles there was never a place anywhere in the Limberlost or in the whole world where the thistledown floated and sprang up and blossomed into white lilies
Thistles grow from thistles and lilies from other lilies
Dear Freckles think hard
You must see it
You are a lily straight through
You never never could have drifted from the thistlepatch
Where did you find the courage to go into the Limberlost and face its terrors
You inherited it from the blood of a brave father dear heart
Where did you get the pluck to hold for over a year a job that few men would have taken at all
You got it from a plucky mother you bravest of boys
You attacked singlehanded a man almost twice your size and fought as a demon merely at the suggestion that you be deceptive and dishonest
Could your mother or your father have been untruthful
Here you are so hungry and starved that you are dying for love
Where did you get all that capacity for loving
You didnt inherit it from hardened heartless people who would disfigure you and purposely leave you to die thats one sure thing
You once told me of saving your big bullfrog from a rattlesnake
You knew you risked a horrible death when you did it
Yet you will spend miserable years torturing yourself with the idea that your own mother might have cut off that hand
Shame on you Freckles
Your mother would have done this The Angel deliberately turned back the cover slipped up the sleeve and laid her lips on the scars
Freckles
Wake up
she cried almost shaking him
Come to your senses
Be a thinking reasoning man
You have brooded too much and been all your life too much alone
Its all as plain as plain can be to me
You must see it
Like breeds like in this world
You must be some sort of a reproduction of your parents and I am not afraid to vouch for them not for a minute
And then too if more proof is needed here it is Mr McLean says that you never once have failed in tact and courtesy
He says that you are the most perfect gentleman he ever knew and he has traveled the world over
How does it happen Freckles
No one at that Home taught you
Hundreds of men couldnt be taught even in a school of etiquette so it must be instinctive with you
If it is why that means that it is born in you and a direct inheritance from a race of men that have been gentlemen for ages and couldnt be anything else
Then theres your singing
I dont believe there ever was a mortal with a sweeter voice than yours and while that doesnt prove anything there is a point that does
The little training you had from that choirmaster wont account for the wonderful accent and ease with which you sing
Somewhere in your close blood is a marvelously trained vocalist we every one of us believe that Freckles
Why does my father refer to you constantly as being of fine perceptions and honor
Because you are Freckles
Why does the Bird Woman leave her precious work and come here to help look after you
I never heard of her losing any time over anyone else
Its because she loves you
And why does Mr McLean turn all of his valuable business over to hired men and watch you personally
And why is he hunting excuses every day to spend money on you
My father says McLean is full Scotchclose with a dollar
He is a hardheaded business man Freckles and he is doing it because he finds you worthy of it
Worthy of all we all can do and more than we know how to do dear heart
Freckles are you listening to me
Oh
wont you see it
Wont you believe it
Oh Angel
chattered the bewildered Freckles are you truly maning it
Could it be
Of course it could flashed the Angel because it just is
But you cant prove it wailed Freckles
It aint giving me a name or me honor
Freckles said the Angel sternly you are unreasonable
Why I did prove every word I said
Everything proves it
You look here
If you knew for sure that I could give you a name and your honor and prove to you that your mother did love you why then would you just go to breathing like perpetual motion and hang on for dear life and get well
A bright light shone in Freckles eyes
If I knew that Angel he said solemnly you couldnt be killing me if you felled the biggest tree in the Limberlost smash on me
Then you go right to work said the Angel and before night Ill prove one thing to you I can show you easily enough how much your mother loved you
That will be the first step and then the remainder will all come
If my father and Mr McLean are so anxious to spend some money Ill give them a chance
I dont see why we havent comprehended how you felt and so have been at work weeks ago
Weve been awfully selfish
Weve all been so comfortable we never stopped to think what other people were suffering before our eyes
None of us has understood
Ill hire the finest detective in Chicago and well go to work together
This is nothing compared with things people do find out
Well go at it beak and claw and well show you a thing or two
Freckles caught her sleeve
Me mother Angel
Me mother
he marveled hoarsely
Did you say you could be finding out today if me mother loved me
How
Oh Angel
Nothing matters IF ONLY ME MOTHER DIDNT DO IT
Then you rest easy said the Angel with large confidence
Your mother didnt do it
Mothers of sons such as you dont do things like that
Ill go to work at once and prove it to you
The first thing to do is to go to that Home where you were and get the clothes you wore the night you were left there
I know that they are required to save those things carefully
We can find out almost all there is to know about your mother from them
Did you ever see them
Yis he replied
Freckles
Were they white
she cried
Maybe they were once
Theyre all yellow with laying and brown with bloodstains now said Freckles the old note of bitterness creeping in
You cant be telling anything at all by them Angel
Well but I just can
said the Angel positively
I can see from the quality what kind of goods your mother could afford to buy
I can see from the cut whether she had good taste
I can see from the care she took in making them how much she loved and wanted you
But how
Angel tell me how
implored Freckles with trembling eagerness
Why easily enough said the Angel
I thought youd understand
People that can afford anything at all always buy white for little new babieslinen and lace and the very finest things to be had
Theres a young woman living near us who cut up her wedding clothes to have fine things for her baby
Mothers who love and want their babies dont buy little rough readymade things and they dont run up what they make on an old sewing machine
They make fine seams and tucks and put on lace and trimming by hand
They sit and stitch and stitchlittle even stitches every one just as careful
Their eyes shine and their faces glow
When they have to quit to do something else they look sorry and fold up their work so particularly
There isnt much worth knowing about your mother that those little clothes wont tell
I can see her putting the little stitches into them and smiling with shining eyes over your coming
Freckles Ill wager you a dollar those little clothes of yours are just alive with the dearest tiny handmade stitches
A new light dawned in Freckles eyes
A tinge of warm color swept into his face
Renewed strength was noticeable in his grip of her hands
Oh Angel
Will you go now
Will you be hurrying
he cried
Right away said the Angel
I wont stop for a thing and Ill hurry with all my might
She smoothed his pillow straightened the cover gave him one steady look in the eyes and went quietly from the room
Outside the door McLean and the surgeon anxiously awaited her
McLean caught her shoulders
Angel what have you done
he demanded
The Angel smiled defiance into his eyes
What have I done
she repeated
Ive tried to save Freckles
What will your father say
groaned McLean
It strikes me said the Angel that what Freckles said would be to the point
Freckles
exclaimed McLean
What could he say
He seemed to be able to say several things answered the Angel sweetly
I fancy the one that concerns you most at present was that if my father should offer me to him he would not have me
And no one knows why better than I do cried McLean
Every day he must astonish me with some new fineness
He turned to the surgeon
Save him
he commanded
Save him
he implored
He is too fine to be sacrificed
His salvation lies here said the surgeon stroking the Angels sunshiny hair and I can read in the face of her that she knows how she is going to work it out
Dont trouble for the boy
She will save him
The Angel laughingly sped down the hall and into the street just as she was
I have come she said to the matron of the Home to ask if you will allow me to examine or better yet to take with me the little clothes that a boy you called Freckles discharged last fall wore the night he was left here
The woman looked at her in greater astonishment than the occasion demanded
Well Id be glad to let you see them she said at last but the fact is we havent them
I do hope we havent made some mistake
I was thoroughly convinced and so was the superintendent
We let his people take those things away yesterday
Who are you and what do you want with them
The Angel stood dazed and speechless staring at the matron
There couldnt have been a mistake continued the matron seeing the Angels distress
Freckles was here when I took charge ten years ago
These people had it all proved that he belonged to them
They had him traced to where he ran away in Illinois last fall and there they completely lost track of him
Im sorry you seem so disappointed but it is all right
The man is his uncle and as like the boy as he possibly could be
He is almost killed to go back without him
If you know where Freckles is theyd give big money to find out
The Angel laid a hand along each cheek to steady her chattering teeth
Who are they
she stammered
Where are they going
They are Irish folks miss said the matron
They have been in Chicago and over the country for the past three months hunting him everywhere
They have given up and are starting home today
They Did they leave an address
Where could I find them
interrupted the Angel
They left a card and I notice the morning paper has the mans picture and is full of them
Theyve advertised a great deal in the city papers
Its a wonder you havent seen something
Trains dont run right
We never get Chicago papers said the Angel
Please give me that card quickly
They may escape me
I simply must catch them
The matron hurried to the secretary and came back with a card
Their addresses are there she said
Both in Chicago and at their home
They made them full and plain and I was to cable at once if I got the least clue of him at any time
If theyve left the city you can stop them in New York
Youre sure to catch them before they sailif you hurry
The matron caught up a paper and thrust it into the Angels hand as she ran to the street
The Angel glanced at the card
The Chicago address was Suite Eleven Auditorium
She laid her hand on her drivers sleeve and looked into his eyes
There is a fastdriving limit
she asked
Yes miss
Will you crowd it all you can without danger of arrest
I will pay well
I must catch some people
Then she smiled at him
The hospital an Orphans Home and the Auditorium seemed a queer combination to that driver but the Angel was always and everywhere the Angel and her methods were strictly her own
I will take you there as quickly as any man could with a team he said promptly
The Angel clung to the card and paper and as best she could in the lurching swaying cab read the addresses over
OMore Suite Eleven Auditorium
OMore she repeated
Seems to fit Freckles to a dot
Wonder if that could be his name
Suite Eleven means that you are pretty well fixed
Suites in the Auditorium come high
Then she turned the card and read on its reverse Lord Maxwell OMore M P Killvany Place County Clare Ireland
The Angel sat on the edge of the seat bracing her feet against the one opposite as the cab pitched and swung around corners and past vehicles
She mechanically fingered the pasteboard and stared straight ahead
Then she drew a deep breath and read the card again
A Lordman
she groaned despairingly
A Lordman
Bet my hoecakes scorched
Here Ive gone and pledged my word to Freckles Id find him some decent relatives that he could be proud of and now there isnt a chance out of a dozen that hell have to be ashamed of them after all
Its too mean
The tears of vexation rolled down the tired nerveracked Angels cheeks
This isnt going to do she said resolutely wiping her eyes with the palm of her hand and gulping down the nervous spasm in her throat
I must read this paper before I meet Lord OMore
She blinked back the tears and spreading the paper on her knee read After three months fruitless search Lord OMore gives up the quest of his lost nephew and leaves Chicago today for his home in Ireland
She read on and realized every word
The likeness settled any doubt
It was Freckles over again only older and well dressed
Well I must catch you if I can muttered the Angel
But when I do if you are a gentleman in name only you shant have Freckles thats flat
Youre not his father and he is twenty
Anyway if the law will give him to you for one year you cant spoil him because nobody could and she added brightening hell probably do you a lot of good
Freckles and I both must study years yet and you should be something that will save him
I guess it will come out all right
At least I dont believe you can take him away if I say no
Thank you and wait no matter how long she said to her driver
Catching up the paper she hurried to the desk and laid down Lord OMores card
Has my uncle started yet
she asked sweetly
The surprised clerk stepped back on a bellboy and covertly kicked him for being in the way
His lordship is in his room he said with a low bow
All right said the Angel picking up the card
I thought he might have started
Ill see him
The clerk shoved the bellboy toward the Angel
Show her ladyship to the elevator and Lord OMores suite he said bowing double
Aw thanks said the Angel with a slight nod as she turned away
Im not sure she muttered to herself as the elevator sped upward whether its the Irish or the English who say Aw thanks but its probable he isnt either and anyway I just had to do something to counteract that All right
How stupid of me
At the bellboys tap the door swung open and the liveried servant thrust a cardtray before the Angel
The opening of the door created a current that swayed a curtain aside and in an adjoining room lounging in a big chair with a paper in his hand sat a man who was beyond question of Freckles blood and race
With perfect control the Angel dropped Lord OMores card in the tray stepped past his servant and stood before his lordship
Good morning she said with tense politeness
Lord OMore said nothing
He carelessly glanced her over with amused curiosity until her color began to deepen and her blood to run hotly
Well my dear he said at last how can I serve you
Instantly the Angel became indignant
She had been so shielded in the midst of almost entire freedom owing to the circumstances of her life that the words and the look appeared to her as almost insulting
She lifted her head with a proud gesture
I am not your dear she said with slow distinctness
There isnt a thing in the world you can do for me
I came here to see if I could do somethinga very great somethingfor you but if I dont like you I wont do it
Then Lord OMore did stare
Suddenly he broke into a ringing laugh
Without a change of attitude or expression the Angel stood looking steadily at him
There was a silken rustle then a beautiful woman with cheeks of satiny pink dark hair and eyes of pure Irish blue moved to Lord OMores side and catching his arm shook him impatiently
Terence
Have you lost your senses
she cried
Didnt you understand what the child said
Look at her face
See what she has
Lord OMore opened his eyes widely and sat up
He did look at the Angels face intently and suddenly found it so good that it was difficult to follow the next injunction
He arose instantly
I beg your pardon he said
The fact is I am leaving Chicago sorely disappointed
It makes me bitter and reckless
I thought you one more of those queer useless people who have thrust themselves on me constantly and I was careless
Forgive me and tell me why you came
I will if I like you said the Angel stoutly and if I dont I wont
But I began all wrong and now I dont know how to make you like me said his lordship with sincere penitence in his tone
The Angel found herself yielding to his voice
He spoke in a soft mellow smoothly flowing Irish tone and although his speech was perfectly correct it was so rounded and accented and the sentences so turned that it was Freckles over again
Still it was a matter of the very greatest importance and she must be sure so she looked into the beautiful womans face
Are you his wife
she asked
Yes said the woman I am his wife
Well said the Angel judicially the Bird Woman says no one in the whole world knows all a mans bignesses and all his littlenesses as his wife does
What you think of him should do for me
Do you like him
The question was so earnestly asked that it met with equal earnestness
The dark head moved caressingly against Lord OMores sleeve
Better than anyone in the whole world said Lady OMore promptly
The Angel mused a second and then her legal tinge came to the fore again
Yes but have you anyone you could like better if he wasnt all right
she persisted
I have three of his sons two little daughters a father mother and several brothers and sisters came the quick reply
And you like him best
persisted the Angel with finality
I love him so much that I would give up every one of them with dry eyes if by so doing I could save him cried Lord OMores wife
Oh
cried the Angel
Oh my
She lifted her clear eyes to Lord OMores and shook her head
She never never could do that
she said
But its a mighty big thing to your credit that she THINKS she could
I guess Ill tell you why I came
She laid down the paper and touched the portrait
When you were only a boy did people call you Freckles
she asked
Dozens of good fellows all over Ireland and the Continent are doing it today answered Lord OMore
The Angels face wore her most beautiful smile
I was sure of it she said winningly
Thats what we call him and he is so like you I doubt if any one of those three boys of yours are more so
But its been twenty years
Seems to me youve been a long time coming
Lord OMore caught the Angels wrists and his wife slipped her arms around her
Steady my girl
said the mans voice hoarsely
Dont make me think youve brought word of the boy at this last hour unless you know surely
Its all right said the Angel
We have him and theres no chance of a mistake
If I hadnt gone to that Home for his little clothes and heard of you and been hunting you and had met you on the street or anywhere I would have stopped you and asked you who you were just because you are so like him
Its all right
I can tell you where Freckles is but whether you deserve to knowthats another matter
Lord OMore did not hear her
He dropped in his chair and covering his face burst into those terrible sobs that shake and rend a strong man
Lady OMore hovered over him weeping
Umph
Looks pretty fair for Freckles muttered the Angel
Lots of things can be explained now perhaps they can explain this
They did explain so satisfactorily that in a few minutes the Angel was on her feet hurrying Lord and Lady OMore to reach the hospital
You said Freckles old nurse knew his mothers picture instantly said the Angel
I want that picture and the bundle of little clothes
Lady OMore gave them into her hands
The likeness was a large miniature painted on ivory with a frame of beaten gold
Surrounded by masses of dark hair was a delicately cut face
In the upper part of it there was no trace of Freckles but the lips curving in a smile were his very own
The Angel gazed at it steadily
Then with a quivering breath she laid the portrait aside and reached both hands to Lord OMore
That will save Freckles life and insure his happiness she said positively
Thank you oh thank you for coming
She opened the bundle of yellow and brown linen and gave only a glance at the texture and work
Then she gathered the little clothes and the picture to her heart and led the way to the cab
Ushering Lord and Lady OMore into the reception room she said to McLean Please go call up my father and ask him to come on the first train
She closed the door after him
These are Freckles people she said to the Bird Woman
You can find out about each other Im going to him
CHAPTER XIX Wherein Freckles Finds His Birthright and the Angel Loses Her Heart The nurse left the room quietly as the Angel entered carrying the bundle and picture
When they were alone she turned to Freckles and saw that the crisis was indeed at hand
That she had good word to give him was his salvation for despite the heavy plaster jacket that held his body immovable his head was lifted from the pillow
Both arms reached for her
His lips and cheeks flamed while his eyes flashed with excitement
Angel he panted
Oh Angel
Did you find them
Are they white
Are the little stitches there
OH ANGEL
DID ME MOTHER LOVE ME
The words seemed to leap from his burning lips
The Angel dropped the bundle on the bed and laid the picture face down across his knees
She gently pushed his head to the pillow and caught his arms in a firm grasp
Yes dear heart she said with fullest assurance
No little clothes were ever whiter
I never in all my life saw such dainty fine little stitches and as for loving you no boys mother ever loved him more
A nervous trembling seized Freckles
Sure
Are you sure
he urged with clicking teeth
I know said the Angel firmly
And Freckles while you rest and be glad I want to tell you a story
When you feel stronger we will look at the clothes together
They are here
They are all right
But while I was at the Home getting them I heard of some people that were hunting a lost boy
I went to see them and what they told me was all so exactly like what might have happened to you that I must tell you
Then youll understand that things could be very different from what you always have tortured yourself with thinking
Are you strong enough to listen
May I tell you
Maybe twasnt me mother
Maybe someone else made those little stitches
Now goosie dont you begin that said the Angel because I know that it was
Know
cried Freckles his head springing from the pillow
Know
How can you know
The Angel gently soothed him back
Why because nobody else would ever sit and do it the way it is done
Thats how I know she said emphatically
Now you listen while I tell you about this lost boy and his people who have hunted for months and cant find him
Freckles lay quietly under her touch but he did not hear a word that she was saying until his roving eyes rested on her face he immediately noticed a remarkable thing
For the first time she was talking to him and avoiding his eyes
That was not like the Angel at all
It was the delight of hearing her speak that she looked one squarely in the face and with perfect frankness
There were no side glances and downdrooping eyes when the Angel talked she was business straight through
Instantly Freckles wandering thoughts fastened on her words 
and he was a sour grumpy old man she was saying
He always had been spoiled because he was an only son so he had a title and a big estate
He would have just his way no matter about his sweet little wife or his boys or anyone
So when his elder son fell in love with a beautiful girl having a title the very girl of all the world his father wanted him to and added a big adjoining estate to his why that pleased him mightily
Then he went and ordered his younger son to marry a poky kind of a girl that no one liked to add another big estate on the other side and that was different
That was all the world different because the elder son had been in love all his life with the girl he married and oh Freckles its no wonder for I saw her
Shes a beauty and she has the sweetest way
But that poor younger son he had been in love with the village vicars daughter all his life
Thats no wonder either for she was more beautiful yet
She could sing as the angels but she hadnt a cent
She loved him to death too if he was bony and freckled and redhairedI dont mean that
They didnt say what color his hair was but his fathers must have been the reddest ever for when he found out about them and it wasnt anything so terrible HE JUST CAVED
The old man went to see the girlthe pretty one with no money of courseand he hurt her feelings until she ran away
She went to London and began studying music
Soon she grew to be a fine singer so she joined a company and came to this country
When the younger son found that she had left London he followed her
When she got here all alone and afraid and saw him coming to her why she was so glad she up and married him just like anybody else would have done
He didnt want her to travel with the troupe so when they reached Chicago they thought that would be a good place and they stopped while he hunted work
It was slow business because he never had been taught to do a useful thing and he didnt even know how to hunt work least of all to do it when he found it so pretty soon things were going wrong
But if he couldnt find work she could always sing so she sang at night and made little things in the daytime
He didnt like her to sing in public and he wouldnt allow her when he could HELP himself but winter came it was very cold and fire was expensive
Rents went up and they had to move farther out to cheaper and cheaper places and you were comingI mean the boy that is lost was comingand they were almost distracted
Then the man wrote and told his father all about it and his father sent the letter back unopened with a line telling him never to write again
When the baby came there was very little left to pawn for food and a doctor and nothing at all for a nurse so an old neighbor woman went in and took care of the young mother and the little baby because she was so sorry for them
By that time they were away in the suburbs on the top floor of a little wooden house among a lot of big factories and it kept growing colder with less to eat
Then the man grew desperate and he went just to find something to eat and the woman was desperate too
She got up left the old woman to take care of her baby and went into the city to sing for some money
The woman became so cold she put the baby in bed and went home
Then a boiler blew up in a big factory beside the little house and set it on fire
A piece of iron was pitched across and broke through the roof
It came down smash and cut just one little hand off the poor baby
It screamed and screamed and the fire kept coming closer and closer
The old woman ran out with the other people and saw what had happened
She knew there wasnt going to be time to wait for firemen or anything so she ran into the building
She could hear the baby screaming and she couldnt stand that so she worked her way to it
There it was all hurt and bleeding
Then she was almost scared to death over thinking what its mother would do to her for going away and leaving it so she ran to a Home for little friendless babies that was close and banged on the door
Then she hid across the street until the baby was taken in and then she ran back to see if her own house was burning
The big factory and the little house and a lot of others were all gone
The people there told her that the beautiful lady came back and ran into the house to find her baby
She had just gone in when her husband came and he went in after her and the house fell over both of them
Freckles lay rigidly with his eyes on the Angels face while she talked rapidly to the ceiling
Then the old woman was sick about that poor little baby
She was afraid to tell them at the Home because she knew she never should have left it but she wrote a letter and sent it to where the beautiful woman when she was ill had said her husbands people lived
She told all about the little baby that she could remember when it was born how it was named for the mans elder brother that its hand had been cut off in the fire and where she had put it to be doctored and taken care of
She told them that its mother and father were both burned and she begged and implored them to come after it
Youd think that would have melted a heart of ice but that old man hadnt any heart to melt for he got that letter and read it
He hid it away among his papers and never told a soul
A few months ago he died
When his elder son went to settle his business he found the letter almost the first thing
He dropped everything and came with his wife to hunt that baby because he always had loved his brother dearly and wanted him back
He had hunted for him all he dared all these years but when he got here you were goneI mean the baby was gone and I had to tell you Freckles for you see it might have happened to you like that just as easy as to that other lost boy
Freckles reached up and turned the Angels face until he compelled her eyes to meet his
Angel he asked quietly why dont you look at me when you are telling about that lost boy
II didnt know I wasnt faltered the Angel
It seems to me said Freckles his breath beginning to come in sharp wheezes that you got us rather mixed and it aint like you to be mixing things till one cant be knowing
If they were telling you so much did they say which hand was for being off that lost boy
The Angels eyes escaped again
Itit was the same as yours she ventured barely breathing in her fear
Still Freckles lay rigid and whiter than the coverlet
Would that boy be as old as me
he asked
Yes said the Angel faintly
Angel said Freckles at last catching her wrist are you trying to tell me that there is somebody hunting a boy that youre thinking might be me
Are you belavin youve found me relations
Then the Angels eyes came home
The time had come
She pinioned Freckles arms to his sides and bent above him
How strong are you dear heart
she breathed
How brave are you
Can you bear it
Dare I tell you that
No
gasped Freckles
Not if youre sure
I cant bear it
Ill die if you do
The day had been one unremitting strain with the Angel
Nerve tension was drawn to the finest thread
It snapped suddenly
Die
she flamed
Die if I tell you that
You said this morning that you would die if you DIDNT know your name and if your people were honorable
Now Ive gone and found you a name that stands for ages of honor a mother who loved you enough to go into the fire and die for you and the nicest kind of relatives and you turn round and say youll die over that
YOU JUST TRY DYING AND YOULL GET A GOOD SLAP
The Angel stood glaring at him
One second Freckles lay paralyzed and dumb with astonishment
The next the Irish in his soul arose above everything
A laugh burst from him
The terrified Angel caught him in her arms and tried to stifle the sound
She implored and commanded
When he was too worn to utter another sound his eyes laughed silently
After a long time when he was quiet and rested the Angel commenced talking to him gently and this time her big eyes humid with tenderness and mellow with happiness seemed as if they could not leave his face
Dear Freckles she was saying across your knees there is the face of the mother who went into the fire for you and I know the nameold and full of honorto which you were born
Dear heart which will you have first
Freckles was very tired the big drops of perspiration ran together on his temples but the watching Angel caught the words his lips formed Me mother
She lifted the lovely pictured face and set it in the nook of his arm
Freckles caught her hand and drew her beside him and together they gazed at the picture while the tears slid over their cheeks
Me mother
Oh me mother
Can you ever be forgiving me
Oh me beautiful little mother
chanted Freckles over and over in exalted wonder until he was so completely exhausted that his lips refused to form the question in his weary eyes
Wait
cried the Angel with inborn refinement for she could no more answer that question than he could ask
Wait I will write it
She hurried to the table caught up the nurses pencil and on the back of a prescription tablet scrawled it Terence Maxwell OMore Dunderry House County Clare Ireland
Before she had finished came Freckles voice Angel are you hurrying
Yes said the Angel I am
But there is a good deal of it
I have to put in your house and country so that you will feel located
Me house
marveled Freckles
Of course said the Angel
Your uncle says your grandmother left your father her dower house and estate because she knew his father would cut him off
You get that and all your share of your grandfathers property besides
It is all set off for you and waiting
Lord OMore told me so
I suspect you are richer than McLean Freckles
She closed his fingers over the slip and straightened his hair
Now you are all right dear Limberlost guard she said
You go to sleep and dont think of a thing but just pure joy joy joy
Ill keep your people until you wake up
You are too tired to see anyone else just now
Freckles caught her skirt as she turned from him
Ill go to sleep in five minutes he said if you will be doing just one thing more for me
Send for your father
Oh Angel send for him quick
How will I ever be waiting until he comes
One instant the Angel stood looking at him
The next a crimson wave darkly stained her lovely face
Her chin began a spasmodic quivering and the tears sprang into her eyes
Her hands caught at her chest as if she were stifling
Freckles grasp on her tightened until he drew her beside him
He slipped his arm around her and drew her face to his pillow
Dont Angel for the love of mercy dont be doing that he implored
I cant be bearing it
Tell me
You must tell me
The Angel shook her head
That aint fair Angel said Freckles
You made me tell you when it was like tearing the heart raw from me breast
And you was for making everything heavenjust heaven and nothing else for me
If Im so much more now than I was an hour ago maybe I can be thinking of some way to fix things
You will be telling me
he coaxed moving his cheek against her hair
The Angels head moved in negation
Freckles did a moment of intent thinking
Maybe I can be guessing he whispered
Will you be giving me three chances
There was the faintest possible assent
You didnt want me to be knowing me name guessed Freckles
The Angels head sprang from the pillow and her tearstained face flamed with outraged indignation
Why I did too
she cried angrily
One gone said Freckles calmly
You didnt want me to have relatives a home and money
I did
exclaimed the Angel
Didnt I go myself all alone into the city and find them when I was afraid as death
I did too
Two gone said Freckles
You didnt want the beautifulest girl in the world to be telling me Down went the Angels face and a heavy sob shook her
Freckles clasp tightened around her shoulders while his face in its conflicting emotions was a study
He was so stunned and bewildered by the miracle that had been performed in bringing to light his name and relatives that he had no strength left for elaborate mental processes
Despite all it meant to him to know his name at last and that he was of honorable birthknowledge without which life was an eternal disgrace and burden the one thing that was hammering in Freckles heart and beating in his brain past any attempted expression was the fact that while nameless and possibly born in shame the Angel had told him that she loved him
He could find no word with which to begin to voice the rapture of his heart over that
But if she regretted itif it had been a thing done out of her pity for his condition or her feeling of responsibility if it killed him after all there was only one thing left to do
Not for McLean not for the Bird Woman not for the Duncans would Freckles have done itbut for the Angelif it would make her happyhe would do anything
Angel whispered Freckles with his lips against her hair you havent learned your history book very well or else youve forgotten
Forgotten what
sobbed the Angel
Forgotten about the real knight Ladybird breathed Freckles
Dont you know that if anything happened that made his lady sorry a real knight just simply couldnt be remembering it
Angel darling little Swamp Angel you be listening to me
There was one night on the trail one solemn grand white night that there wasnt ever any other like before or since when the dear Boss put his arm around me and told me that he loved me but if you care Angel if you dont want it that way why I aint remembering that anyone else ever didnot in me whole life
The Angel lifted her head and looked into the depths of Freckles honest gray eyes and they met hers unwaveringly but the pain in them was pitiful
Do you mean she demanded that you dont remember that a brazen forward girl told you when you hadnt asked her that shethe Angel choked on it a second but she gave a gulp and brought it out bravelythat she loved you
No
cried Freckles
No
I dont remember anything of the kind
But all the songbirds of his soul burst into melody over that one little clause When you hadnt asked her
But you will said the Angel
You may live to be an old old man and then you will
I will not
cried Freckles
How can you think it Angel
You wont even LOOK as if you remember
I will not
persisted Freckles
Ill be swearing to it if you want me to
If you wasnt too tired to think this thing out straight youd be seeing that I couldntthat I just simply couldnt
Id rather give it all up now and go into eternity alone without ever seeing a soul of me same blood or me home or hearing another man call me by the name I was born to than to remember anything that would be hurting you Angel
I should think youd be understanding that it aint no ways possible for me to do it
The Angels tearstained face flashed into dazzling beauty
A halfhysterical little laugh broke from her heart and bubbled over her lips
Oh Freckles forgive me
she cried
Ive been through so much that Im scarcely myself or I wouldnt be here bothering you when you should be sleeping
Of course you couldnt
I knew it all the time
I was just scared
I was forgetting that you were you
Youre too good a knight to remember a thing like that
Of course you are
And when you dont remember why then its the same as if it never happened
I was almost killed because Id gone and spoiled everything but now it will be all right
Now you can go on and do things like other men and I can have some flowers and letters and my sweetheart coming and when you are SURE why then YOU can tell ME things cant you
Oh Freckles Im so glad
Oh Im so happy
Its dear of you not to remember Freckles perfectly dear
Its no wonder I love you so
The wonder would be if I did not
Oh I should like to know how Im ever going to make you understand how much I love you
Pillow and all she caught him to her breast one long second then she was gone
Freckles lay dazed with astonishment
At last his amazed eyes searched the room for something approaching the human to which he could appeal and falling on his mothers portrait he set it before him
For the love of life
Me little mother he panted did you hear that
Did you hear it
Tell me am I living or am I dead and all heaven come true this minute
Did you hear it
He shook the frame in his impatience at receiving no answer
You are only a pictured face he said at last and of course you cant talk but the soul of you must be somewhere and surely in this hour you are close enough to be hearing
Tell me did you hear that
I cant ever be telling a living soul but darling little mother who gave your life for mine I can always be talking of it to you
Every day well talk it over and try to understand the miracle of it
Tell me are all women like that
Were you like me Swamp Angel
If you were then Im understanding why me father followed across the ocean and went into the fire
CHAPTER XX Wherein Freckles returns to the Limberlost and Lord OMore Sails for Ireland Without Him Freckles voice ceased his eyes closed and his head rolled back from exhaustion
Later in the day he insisted on seeing Lord and Lady OMore but he fainted before the resemblance of another man to him and gave all of his friends a terrible fright
The next morning the Man of Affairs with a heart filled with misgivings undertook the interview on which Freckles insisted
His fears were without cause
Freckles was the soul of honor and simplicity
Have they been telling you whats come to me
he asked without even waiting for a greeting
Yes said the Angels father
Do you think you have the very worst of it clear to your understanding
Under Freckles earnest eyes the Man of Affairs answered soberly I think I have Mr
OMore
That was the first time Freckles heard his name from the lips of another
One second he lay overcome the next tears filled his eyes and he reached out his hand
Then the Angels father understood and he clasped that hand and held it in a strong firm grasp
Terence my boy he said let me do the talking
I came here with the understanding that you wanted to ask me for my only child
I should like at the proper time to regard her marriage if she has found the man she desires to marry not as losing all I have but as gaining a man on whom I can depend to love as a son and to take charge of my affairs for her when I retire from business
Bend all of your energies toward rapid recovery and from this hour understand that my daughter and my home are yours
Youre not forgetting this
Freckles lifted his right arm
Terence Im sorrier than I have words to express about that said the Man of Affairs
Its a damnable pity
But if its for me to choose whether I give all I have left in this world to a man lacking a hand or to one of these gambling tippling immoral spendthrifts of today with both hands and feet off their souls and a rotten spot in the core I choose you and it seems that my daughter does the same
Put what is left you of that right arm to the best uses you can in this world and never again mention or feel that it is defective so long as you live
Good day sir
One minute more said Freckles
Yesterday the Angel was telling me that there was money coming to me from two sources
She said that me grandmother had left me father all of her fortune and her house because she knew that his father would be cutting him off and also that me uncle had set aside for me what would be me fathers interest in his fathers estate
Whatever the sum is that me grandmother left me father because she loved him and wanted him to be having it that Ill be taking
Twas hers from her father and she had the right to be giving it as she chose
Anything from the man that knowingly left me father and me mother to go cold and hungry and into the fire in misery when just a little would have made life so beautiful to them and saved me this crippled bodymoney that he willed from me when he knew I was living of his blood and on charity among strangers I dont touch not if I freeze starve and burn too
If there aint enough besides that and I cant be earning enough to fix things for the Angel We are not discussing money
burst in the Man of Affairs
We dont want any bloodmoney
We have all we need without it
If you dont feel right and easy over it dont you touch a cent of any of it
Its right I should have what me grandmother intinded for me father and I want it said Freckles but Id die before Id touch a cent of me grandfathers money
Now said the Angel we are all going home
We have done all we can for Freckles
His people are here
He should know them
They are very anxious to become acquainted with him
Well resign him to them
When he is well why then he will be perfectly free to go to Ireland or come to the Limberlost just as he chooses
We will go at once
McLean held out for a week and then he could endure it no longer
He was heart hungry for Freckles
Communing with himself in the long soundful nights of the swamp he had learned to his astonishment that for the past year his heart had been circling the Limberlost with Freckles
He began to wish that he had not left him
Perhaps the boyhis boy by first right after allwas being neglected
If the Boss had been a nervous old woman he scarcely could have imagined more things that might be going wrong
He started for Chicago loaded with a big box of goldenrod asters fringed gentians and crimson leaves that the Angel carefully had gathered from Freckles room and a little long slender package
He traveled with biting stinging jealousy in his heart
He would not admit it even to himself but he was unable to remain longer away from Freckles and leave him to the care of Lord OMore
In a few minutes talk while McLean awaited admission to Freckles room his lordship had chatted genially of Freckles rapid recovery of his delight that he was unspotted by his early surroundings and his desire to visit the Limberlost with Freckles before they sailed he expressed the hope that he could prevail upon the Angels father to place her in his wifes care and have her education finished in Paris
He said they were anxious to do all they could to help bind Freckles arrangements with the Angel as both he and Lady OMore regarded her as the most promising girl they knew and one who could be fitted to fill the high position in which Freckles would place her
Every word he uttered was pungent with bitterness to McLean
The swamp had lost its flavor without Freckles and yet as Lord OMore talked McLean fervently wished himself in the heart of it
As he entered Freckles room he almost lost his breath
Everything was changed
Freckles lay beside a window where he could follow Lake Michigans blue until the horizon dipped into it
He could see big soft clouds whitecapped waves shimmering sails and puffing steamers trailing billowing banners of lavender and gray across the sky
Gulls and curlews wheeled over the water and dipped their wings in the foam
The room was filled with every luxury that taste and money could introduce
All the tan and sunburn had been washed from Freckles face in sweats of agony
It was a smooth even white its brown rift scarcely showing
What the nurses and Lady OMore had done to Freckles hair McLean could not guess but it was the most beautiful that he ever had seen
Fine as floss bright in color waving and crisp it fell around the white face
They had gotten his arms into and his chest covered with a finely embroidered paleblue silk shirt with soft white tie at the throat
Among the many changes that had taken place during his absence the fact that Freckles was most attractive and barely escaped being handsome remained almost unnoticed by the Boss so great was his astonishment at seeing both cuffs turned back and the right arm in view
Freckles was using the maimed arm that previously he always had hidden
Oh Lord sir but Im glad to see you
cried Freckles almost rolling from the bed as he reached toward McLean
Tell me quick is the Angel well and happy
Can me Little Chicken spread six feet of wing and sail to his mother
Hows me new father the Bird Woman Duncans and Nelliedarling little highstepping Nelie
Me Aunt Alice is going to choose the hat just as soon as Im mended enough to be going with her
How are all the gang
Have they found any more good trees
Ive been thinking a lot sir
I believe I can find others near that last one
Me Aunt Alice thinks maybe I can and Uncle Terence says its likely
Golly but theyre nice ilegant people
I tell you Im proud to be same blood with them
Come closer quick
I was going to do this yesterday and somehow I just felt that youd surely be coming today and I waited
Im selecting the Angels ring stone
The ring she ordered for me is finished and they sent it to keep me company
See
Its an emeraldjust me color Lord OMore says
Freckles flourished his hand
Aint that fine
Never took so much comfort with anything in me life
Every color of the old swamp is in it
I asked the Angel to have a little shamrock leaf cut on it so every time I saw it Id be thinking of the love truth and valor of that song she was teaching me
Aint that a beautiful song
Some of these days Im going to make it echo
Im a little afraid to be doing it with me voice yet but me hearts tuning away on it every blessed hour
Will you be looking at these now
Freckles tilted a tray of unset stones from Peacocks that would have ransomed several valuable kings
He held them toward McLean stirring them with his right arm
I tell you Im glad to see you sir he said
I tried to tell me uncle what I wanted but this aint for him to be mixed up in anyway and I dont think I made it clear to him
I couldnt seem to say the words I wanted
I can be telling you sir
McLeans heart began to thump as a lovers
Go on Freckles he said assuringly
Its this said Freckles
I told him that I would pay only three hundred dollars for the Angels stone
Im thinking that with what he has laid up for me and the bigness of things that the Angel did for me it seems like a stingy little sum to him
I know he thinks I should be giving much more but I feel as if I just had to be buying that stone with money I earned meself and that is all I have saved of me wages
I dont mind paying for the muff or the drexing table or Mrs Duncans things from that other money and later the Angel can have every last cent of me grandmothers if shell take it but just nowoh sir cant you see that I have to be buying this stone with what I have in the bank
Im feeling that I couldnt do any other way and dont you think the Angel would rather have the best stone I can buy with the money I earned meself than a finer one paid for with other money
In other words Freckles said the Boss in a husky voice you dont want to buy the Angels ring with money
You want to give for it your first awful fear of the swamp
You want to pay for it with the loneliness and heart hunger you have suffered there with last winters freezing on the line and this summers burning in the sun
You want it to stand to her for every hour in which you risked your life to fulfill your contract honorably
You want the price of that stone to be the fears that have chilled your heartthe sweat and blood of your body
Freckles eyes were filled with tears and his face quivering with feeling
Dear Mr McLean he said reaching with a caress over the Bosss black hair and his cheek
Dear Boss thats why Ive wanted you so
I knew you would know
Now you will be looking at these
I dont want emeralds because thats what she gave me
He pushed the green stones into a little heap of rejected ones
Then he singled out all the pearls
Aint they pretty things
he said
Ill be getting her some of those later
They are like lily faces turtlehead flowers dewdrops in the shade or moonlight but they havent the life in them that I want in the stone I give to the Angel right now
Freckles heaped the pearls with the emeralds
He studied the diamonds a long time
These things are so fascinating like they almost tempt one though they aint quite the proper thing he said
Ive always dearly loved to be watching yours sir
I must get her some of these big ones too some day
Theyre like the Limberlost in January when its all icecoated and the sun is in the west and shines through and makes all you can see of the whole world look like fire and ice but fire and ice aint like the Angel
The diamonds joined the emeralds and pearls
There was left a little red heap and Freckles fingers touched it with a new tenderness
His eyes were flashing
Im thinking heres me Angels stone he exulted
The Limberlost and me with it grew in mine but its going to bloom and her with it in this
Theres the red of the wild poppies the cardinalflowers and the little bunch of crushed foxfire that we found where she put it to save me
Theres the light of the campfire and the sun setting over Sleepy Snake Creek
Theres the red of the blood we were willing to give for each other
Its like her lips and like the drops that dried on her beautiful arm that first day and Im thinking it must be like the brave tender clean red heart of her
Freckles lifted the ruby to his lips and handed it to McLean
Ill be signing me cheque and you have it set he said
I want you to draw me money and pay for it with those very same dollars sir
Again the heart of McLean took hope
Freckles may I ask you something
he said
Why sure said Freckles
Theres nothing you would be asking that it wouldnt be giving me joy to be telling you
McLeans eyes traveled to Freckles right arm with which he was moving the jewels
Oh that
cried Freckles with a laugh
Youre wanting to know where all the bitterness is gone
Well sir twas carried from me soul heart and body on the lips of an Angel
Seems that hurt was necessary in the beginning to make today come true
The wound had always been raw but the Angel was healing it
If she doesnt care I dont
Me dear new father doesnt nor me aunt and uncle and you never did
Why should I be fretting all me life about what cant be helped
The real truth is that since what happened to it last week Im so everlastingly proud of it I catch meself sticking it out on display a bit
Freckles looked the Boss in the eyes and began to laugh
Well thank heaven
said McLean
Now its me turn said Freckles
I dont know as I ought to be asking you and yet I cant see a reason good enough to keep me from it
Its a thing Ive had on me mind every hour since Ive had time to straighten things out a little
May I be asking you a question
McLean reached over and took Freckles hand
His voice was shaken with feeling as he replied Freckles you almost hurt me
Will you never learn how much you are to mehow happy you make me in coming to me with anything no matter what
Then its this said Freckles gripping the hand of McLean strongly
If this accident and all thats come to me since had never happened where was it you had planned to send me to school
What was it you meant for me to do
Why Freckles answered McLean Im scarcely prepared to state definitely
My ideas were rather hazy
I thought we would make a beginning and see which way things went
I figured on taking you to Grand Rapids first and putting you in the care of my mother
I had an idea it would be best to secure a private tutor to coach you for a year or two until you were ready to enter Ann Arbor or the Chicago University in good shape
Then I thought wed finish in this country at Yale or Harvard and end with Oxford to get a good allround flavor
Is that all
asked Freckles
No thats leaving the music out said McLean
I intended to have your voice tested by some master and if you really were endowed for a career as a great musician and had inclinations that way I wished to have you drop some of the college work and make music your chief study
Finally I wanted us to take a trip through Europe and clear around the circle together And then what
queried Freckles breathlessly
Why then said McLean you know that my heart is hopelessly in the woods
I never will quit the timber business while there is timber to handle and breath in my body
I thought if you didnt make a profession of music and had any inclination my way we would stretch the partnership one more and take you into the firm placing your work with me
Those plans may sound jumbled in the telling but they have grown steadily on me Freckles as you have grown dear to me
Freckles lifted anxious and eager eyes to McLean
You told me once on the trail and again when we thought that I was dying that you loved me
Do these things that have come to me make any difference in any way with your feeing toward me
None said McLean
How could they Freckles
Nothing could make me love you more and you never will do anything that will make me love you less
Glory be to God
cried Freckles
Glory to the Almighty
Hurry and be telling your mother Im coming
Just as soon as I can get on me feet Ill be taking that ring to me Angel and then Ill go to Grand Rapids and be making me start just as you planned only that I can be paying me own way
When Im educated enough well allthe Angel and her father the Bird Woman you and meall of us will go together and see me house and me relations and be taking that trip
When we get back well add OMore to the Lumber Company and golly sir but well make things hum
Good land sir
Dont do that
Why Mr McLean dear Boss dear father dont be doing that
What is it
Nothing nothing
boomed McLeans deep bass nothing at all
He abruptly turned and hurried to the window
This is a mighty fine view he said
Lakes beautiful this morning
No wonder Chicago people are so proud of their citys location on its shore
But Freckles what is Lord OMore going to say to this
I dont know said Freckles
I am going to be cut deep if he cares for hes been more than good to me and Lady Alice is next to me Angel
Hes made me feel me blood and race me own possession
Shes talked to me by the hour of me father and mother and me grandmother
Shes made them all that real I can lay claim to them and feel that they are mine
Im very sorry to be hurting them if it will but it cant be changed
Nobody ever puts the width of the ocean between me and the Angel
From here to the Limberlost is all I can be bearing peaceable
I want the education and then I want to work and live here in the country where I was born and where the ashes of me father and mother rest
Ill be glad to see Ireland and glad especial to see those little people who are my kin but I aint ever staying long
All me heart is the Angels and the Limberlost is calling every minute
Youre thinking sir that when I look from that window I see the beautiful water aint you
Im not
I see soft slow clouds oozing across the blue me big black chickens hanging up there and a great feather softly sliding down
I see mighty trees swinging vines bright flowers and always masses of the wild roses with the wild rose face of me Ladybird looking through
I see the swale rocking smell the sweetness of the blooming things and the damp mucky odor of the swamp and I hear me birds sing me squirrels bark the rattlers hiss and the step of Wessner or Black Jack coming and whether its the things that I loved or the things that I feared its all a part of the day
Me hearts all me Swamp Angels and me love is all hers and I have her and the swamp so confused in me mind I never can be separating them
When I look at her I see blue sky the sun rifting through the leaves and pink and red flowers and when I look at the Limberlost I see a pink face with blue eyes gold hair and red lips and its the truth sir theyre mixed till theyre one to me
Im afraid it will be hurting some but I have the feeing that I can be making my dear people understand so that they will be willing to let me come back home
Send Lady OMore to put these flowers God made in the place of these glasshouse ilegancies and please be cutting the string of this little package the Angels sent me
As Freckles held up the package the lights of the Limberlost flashed from the emerald on his finger
On the cover was printed To the Limberlost Guard
Under it was a big crisp iridescent black feather
