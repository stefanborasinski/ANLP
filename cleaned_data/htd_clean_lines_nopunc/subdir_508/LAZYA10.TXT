Jean sixteen and a range girl to the last fiber of her being had gotten up early that morning and had washed the dishes and swept and had shaken the rugs of the little livingroom most vigorously
On her knees with stiff brush and much soapy water she had scrubbed the kitchen floor until the boards dried white as kitchen floors may be
She had baked a loaf of gingerbread that came from the oven with a most delectable odor and had wrapped it in a clean cloth to cool on the kitchen table
Her dad and Lite Avery would show cause for the baking of it when they sat down fresh washed and ravenous to their supper that evening
I mention Jean and her scrubbed kitchen and the gingerbread by way of proving how the Lazy A went unwarned and unsuspecting to the very brink of its disaster
Lite Avery long and lean and silently content with life had ridden away with a package of sandwiches after a full breakfast and a smile from the slim girl who cooked it upon the business of the day which happened to be a long ride with one of the Bar Nothing riders down in the breaks along the river
Jeans father big Aleck Douglas had saddled and ridden away alone upon business of his own
And presently in mid forenoon Jean closed the kitchen door upon an immaculately clean house filled with the warm fragrant odor of her baking and in fresh shirt waist and her best ridingskirt and Stetson went whistling away down the path to the stable and saddled Pard the brown colt that Lite had broken to the saddle for her that spring
In ten minutes or so she went galloping down the coulee and out upon the trail to town which was fifteen miles away and held a chum of hers
So Lazy A coulee was left at peace with scratching hens busy with the feeding of halffeathered chicks and a rooster that crowed from the corral fence seven times without stopping to take breath
In the big corral a sorrel mare nosed her colt and nibbled abstractedly at the pile of hay in one corner while the colt wabbled aimlessly up and sniffed curiously and then turned to inspect the rails that felt so queer and hard when he rubbed his nose against them
The sun was warm and cloudshadows drifted lazily across the coulee with the breeze that blew from the west
You never would dream that this was the last daythe last few hours evenwhen the Lazy A would be the untroubled home of three persons of whose lives it formed so great a part
At noon the hens were hovering their chickens in the shade of the mower which Lite was overhauling during his spare time getting it ready for the hay that was growing apace out there in the broad mouth of the coulee
The rooster was wallowing luxuriously in a dusty spot in the corral
The young colt lay stretched out on the fat of its side in the sun sound asleep
The sorrel mare lay beside it asleep also with her head thrown up against her shoulder
Somewhere in a shed a calf was bawling in bored lonesomeness away from its mother feeding down the pasture
And over all the coulee and the buildings nestled against the bluff at its upper end was spread that atmosphere of homey comfort and sheltered calm which surrounds always a home that is happy
Lite Avery riding toward home just when the shadows were beginning to grow long behind him wondered if Jean would be back by the time he reached the ranch
He hoped so with a vague distaste at finding the place empty of her cheerful presence
Be looked at his watch it was nearly four oclock
She ought to be home by halfpast four or five anyway
He glanced sidelong at Jim and quietly slackened his pace a little
Jim was telling one of those long rambling tales of the little happenings of a narrow life and Lite was supposed to be listening instead of thinking about when Jean would return home
Jim believed he was listening and drove home the point of his story
Yes sir thems his very words
Art Osgood heard him
Hell do it too take it from me Crofty is shore riled up this time
Always is Lite observed without paying much attention
Ill turn off here Jim and cut across
Got some work I want to get done yet tonight
So long
He swung away from his companion whose trail to the Bar Nothing led him straight west passing the Lazy A coulee well out from its mouth toward the river
Lite could save a half mile by bearing off to the north and entering the coulee at the eastern side and riding up through the pasture
He wanted to see how the grass was coming on anyway
The last rain should have given it a fresh start
He was in no great hurry after all he had merely been bored with Jims company and wanted to go on alone
And then he could get the fire started for Jean
Lites life was running very smoothly indeed so smoothly that his thoughts occupied themselves largely with little things save when they concerned themselves with Jean who had been away to school for a year and had graduated from high as she called it just a couple of weeks ago and had come home to keep house for dad and Lite
The novelty of her presence on the ranch was still fresh enough to fill his thoughts with her slim attractiveness
Town hadnt spoiled her he thought glowingly
She was the same good little palonly she was growing up pretty fast now
She was a young lady already
So thinking of her with the brightening of spirits which is the first symptom of the worldold emotion called love Lite rounded the eastern arm of the bluff and came within sight of the coulee spread before him shaped like the half of a huge platter with a high rim of bluff on three sides
His first involuntary glance was towards the house and there was unacknowledged expectancy in his eyes
But he did not see Jean nor any sign that she had returned
Instead he saw her father just mounting in haste at the corral
He saw him swing his quirt down along the side of his horse and go tearing down the trail leaving the wire gate flat upon the ground behind himwhich was against all precedent
Lite quickened his own pace
He did not know why big Aleck Douglas should be hitting that pace out of the coulee but since Alecks pace was habitually unhurried the inference was plain enough that there was some urgent need for haste
Lite let down the rails of the barred gate from the meadow into the pasture mounted and went galloping across the uneven sod
His first anxious thought was for the girl
Had something happened to her
At the stable he looked and saw that Jeans saddle did not hang on its accustomed peg inside the door and he breathed freer
She could not have returned then
He turned his own horse inside without taking off the saddle and looked around him puzzled
Nothing seemed wrong about the place
The sorrel mare stood placidly switching at the flies and suckling her gangling colt in the shady corner of the corral and the chickens were pecking desultorily about their feedingground in expectation of the wheat that Jean or Lite would fling to them later on
Not a thing seemed unusual
Yet Lite stood just outside the stable and the sensation that something was wrong grew keener
He was not a nervous personyou would have laughed at the idea of nerves in connection with Lite Avery
He felt that something was wrong just the same
It was not altogether the hurried departure of Aleck Douglas either that made him feel so
He looked at the house setting back there close to the bluff just where it began to curve rudely out from the narrowest part of the coulee
It was still and quiet with closed windows and doors to tell there was no one at home
And yet to Lite its very silence seemed sinister
Wolves were many down in the breaks along the river that spring and the coyotes were an everpresent evil among the calves so that Lite never rode abroad without his sixshooter
He reached back and loosened it in the holster before he started up the sandy path to the house and if you knew the Lazy A ranch as well as Lite knew it from six years of calling it home you would wonder at that action of his which was instinctive and wholly unconscious
So he went up through the sunshine of late afternoon that sent his shadow a full rod before him and he stepped upon the narrow platform before the kitchen door and stood there a minute listening
He heard the mantel clock in the livingroom ticking with the resonance given by a room empty of all other sound
Because his ears were keen he heard also the little alarm clock in the kitchen tickticktick on the shelf behind the stove where Jean kept it daytimes
Peaceful enough for all the silence yet Lite reached back and laid his fingers upon the smooth butt of his sixshooter and opened the door with his left hand which was more or less awkward
He pushed the door open and stepped inside
Then for a full minute he did not move
On the floor that Jean had scrubbed till it was so white a man lay dead stretched upon his back
His eyes stared vacantly straight up at the ceiling where a single cobweb which Jean had not noticed swayed in the aircurrent Lite set in motion with the opening of the door
On the floor where it had dropped from his hand perhaps when he fell a small square piece of gingerbread lay crumbled around the edges
Tragic halo around his head a pool of blood was turning brown and clotted
Lite shivered a little while he stared down at him
In a minute he lifted his eyes from the figure and looked around the small room
The stove shone black in the sunlight which the open door let in
On the table covered with white oilcloth the loaf of gingerbread lay uncovered and beside it lay a knife used to cut off the piece which the man on the floor had not eaten before he died
Nothing else was disturbed
Nothing else seemed in the least to bear any evidence of what had taken place
Lites thoughts turned in spite of him to the man who had ridden from the coulee as though fiends had pursued
The conclusion was obvious yet Lite loyally rejected it in the face of reason
Reason told him that there went the slayer
For this dead man was what was left of Johnny Croft the Crofty of whom Jim had gossiped not more than half an hour before
And the gossip had been of threats which Johnny Croft had made against the two Douglas brothersbig Aleck of the Lazy A and Carl of the Bar Nothing ranch adjoining
Suicide it could scarcely be for Crofty was the type of man who would cling to life besides his gun was in its holster and a man would hardly have the strength or the desire to put away his gun after he has shot himself under one eye
Death had undoubtedly been immediate
Lite thought of these things while he stood there just inside the door
Then he turned slowly and went outside and stood hesitating upon the porch
He did not quite know what he ought to do about it and so he did not mean to be in too great a hurry to do anything that was Lites habit and he had always found that it served him well
If the rider had been fleeing from his crime as was likely Lite had no mind to raise at once the hue and cry
An hour or two could make no difference to the dead manand you must remember that Lite had for six years called this place his home and big Aleck Douglas his friend as well as the man who paid him wages for the work he did
He was half tempted to ride away and say nothing for a while
He could let it appear that he had not been at the house at all and so had not discovered the crime when he did
That would give Aleck Douglas more time to get away
But there was Jean due at any moment now
He could not go away and let Jean discover that gruesome thing on the kitchen floor
He could not take it up and hide it away somewhere he could not do anything it seemed to him but just wait
He went slowly down the path to the stable his chin on his chest his mind grappling with the tragedy and with the problem of how best he might lighten the blow that had fallen upon the ranch
It was unrealit was unthinkablethat Aleck Douglas the man who met but friendly glances ride where he might had done this thing
And yet there was nothing else to believe
Johnny Croft had worked here on the ranch for a couple of months off and on
He had not been steadily employed and he had been paid by the day instead of by the month as was the custom
He had worked also for Carl Douglas at the Bar Nothing back and forth for one or the other as work pressed
He was too erratic to be depended upon except from day to day too prone to saddle his horse and ride to town and forget to return for a day or two days or a week as the mood seized him or his money held out
Lite knew that there had been some dispute when he had left he had claimed payment for more days than he had worked
Aleck was a just man who paid honestly what he owed he was also known to be close fisted
He would pay what he owed and not a nickel morehence the dispute
Johnny had gone away seeming satisfied that his own figures were wrong but later on he had quarreled with Carl over wages and other things
Carl had a bad temper that sometimes got beyond his control and he had ordered Johnny off the ranch
This was part of the long fulldetailed story Jim had been telling
Johnny had left and he had talked about the Douglas brothers to any one who would listen
He had said they were crooked both of them and would cheat a workingman out of his pay
He had come back evidently to renew the argument with Aleck
With the easy ways of ranch people he had gone inside when he found no one at home hungry probably and not at all backward about helping himself to whatever appealed to his appetite
That was Johnnys waya way that went unquestioned since he had lived there long enough to feel at home
Lite remembered with an odd feeling of pity how Johnny had praised the first gingerbread which Jean had baked the day after her arrival and how he had eaten three pieces and had made Jeans cheeks burn with confusion at his bold flattery
He had come back and he had helped himself to the gingerbread
And then he had been shot down
He was lying in there now just as he had fallen and his blood was staining deep the freshscrubbed floor
And Jean would be coming home soon
Lite thought it would be better if he rode out to meet her and told her what had happened so that she need not come upon it unprepared
There was nothing else that he could bring himself to do and his mood demanded action of some sort one could not sit down at peace with a fresh tragedy like that hanging over the place
He had reached the stable when a horse walked out from behind the hay corral and stopped eyeing him curiously
It was Johnnys horse
Even as improvident a cowpuncher as Johnny Croft had been likes to own a private horseone that is his own and can be ridden when and where the owner chooses
Lite turned and went over to it caught it by the dragging bridlereins and led it into an empty stall
He did not know whether he ought to unsaddle it or leave it as it was but on second thought he loosened the cinch in kindness to the animal and took off its bridle so that it could eat without being hampered by the bit
Lite was too thorough a horseman not to be thoughtful of an animals comfort
He led his own horse out and then he stopped abruptly
For Pard stood in front of the kitchen door and Jean was untying a package or two from the saddle
He opened his mouth to call to her he started forward but he was too late to prevent what happened
Before his throat had made a sound Jean turned with the packages in the hollow of her arm and stepped upon the platform with that springy haste of movement which belongs to health and youth and happiness and before he had taken more than the first step away from his horse she had opened the kitchen door
Lite ran then
He did not call to her
What was the use
She had seen
She had dropped her packages and turned and ran to meet him and caught him by the arm in a panic of horror
Lite patted her hand awkwardly not knowing what he ought to say
What made you go in there
came of its own accord from his lips
Thats no place for a girl
Its Johnny Croft
she gasped just above her breath
Howdid it happen Lite
I dont know said Lite slowly looking down and still patting her hand
Your father and I have both been gone all day
I just got back a few minutes ago and found out about it
His tone his manner and his words impressed upon Jean the point he wanted her to getthat her father had not yet returned and so knew nothing of the crime
He led her back to where Pard stood and told her to get on
Without asking him why Jean obeyed him with a shudder when her wide eyes strayed fascinated to the open door and to what lay just within
Lite went up and pulled the door shut and then walking beside her with an arm over Pards neck he led the way down to the stable and mounted Ranger
You cant stay here he explained when she looked at him inquiringly
Do you want to go over and stay at Carls or would you rather go back to town
He rode down toward the gate and Jean kept beside him
Im going to stay with dad she told him shakily
If he stays IllIll stay
Youll not stay he contradicted her bluntly
You cant
It wouldnt be right
And he added selfreproachfully I never thought of your cutting across the bench and riding down the trail back of the house
I meant to head you off Its shorter said Jean briefly
Iif I cant stay Id rather go to town Lite
I dont like to stay over at Uncle Carls
Therefore when they reached the mouth of the coulee Lite turned into the trail that led to town
All down the coulee the trail had been dug deep with the hoofprints of a galloping horse and now on the town trail they were as plain as a primer to one schooled in the open
But Jean was too upset to notice them and for that Lite was thankful
They did not talk much beyond the commonplace speculations which tragedy always brings to the lips of the bystanders
Comments that were perfectly obvious they made it is true
Jean said it was perfectly awful and Lite agreed with her
Jean wondered how it could have happened and Lite said he didnt know
Neither of them said anything about the effect it would have upon their future I dont suppose that Jean at least could remotely guess at the effect
It is certain that Lite preferred not to do so
They were no more than half way to town when they met a group of galloping horsemen their coming heralded for a mile by the dust they kicked out of the trail
In the midst rode Jeans father
Alongside him rode the coroner and behind him rode the sheriff
The rest of the company was made up of men who had heard the news and were coming to look upon the tragedy
Lite drew a long breath of relief
Aleck Douglas then had not been running away
CHAPTER II CONCERNING LITE AND A FEW FOOTPRINTS Lucky you was with me all day up to four oclock Lite Jim said
That lets you out slick and clean seeing the doctor claims hed been dead six hours when he seen him last night
Croftywhy Crofty was laying in there dead when I was talking about him to you
Kinda gives a man the creeps to think of it
Who do you reckon done it Lite
Hown hell do I know
Lite retorted irritably
I didnt see it done
Jim studied awhile an ear cocked for the signal that the coroner was ready to begin the inquest
Say he leaned over and whispered in Lites ear where was Aleck at all day yesterday
Riding over in the bend looking for blackleg signs said Lite promptly
Packed a lunch same as I did
The answer seemed to satisfy Jim and to eliminate from his mind any slight suspicion he may have held but Lite had a sudden impulse to improve upon his statement
I saw Aleck ride into the ranch as I was coming home he said
As he spoke his face lightened as with a weight lifted from his mind
Later when the coroner questioned him about his movements and the movements of Aleck Lite repeated the lie as casually as possible
It might have carried more weight with the jury if Aleck Douglas himself had not testified just before then that he had returned about three oclock to the ranch and pottered around the corral with the mare and colt and unsaddled his horse before going into the house at all
It was only when he had discovered Johnny Crofts horse at the haystack he said that he began to wonder where the rider could be
He had gone to the houseand found him on the kitchen floor
Lite had not heard this statement for the simple reason that being a closely interested person he had been invited to remain outside while Aleck Douglas testified
He wondered why the jurymen whom he knew and had known for years most of them looked at one another so queerly when he declared that he had seen Aleck ride home
The coroner also had given him a queer look but he had not made any comment
Aleck too had turned his head and stared at Lite in a way which Lite preferred to think he had not understood
Beyond that one statement which had produced such a curious effect Lite did not have anything to say that shed the faintest light upon the matter
He told where he had been and that he had discovered the body just before Jean arrived and that he had immediately started with her to town
The coroner did not cross question him
Counting from four oclock which Jim had already named as the time of their separation Lite would have had just about time to do the things he testified to doing
The only thing he claimed to have done and could not possibly have done was to see Aleck Douglas riding into the coulee
Aleck himself had branded that a lie before Lite had ever uttered it
The result was just what was to be expected
Aleck Douglas was placed under arrest and as a prisoner he rode back to town alongside the sheriffan old friend of his by the wayto where Jean waited impatiently for news
It was Lite who told her
Itll come out all right he said in his calm way that might hide a good deal of emotion beneath it
Its just to have something to work fromdont mean anything in particular
Its a funny way the law has got he explained of arresting the last man that saw a fellow alive or the first one that sees him dead
Jean studied this explanation dolefully
They ought to find out the last one that saw him alive she said resentfully and arrest him thenand leave dad out of it
Theres no sense in the law if thats the way it works
Well I didnt make the law Lite observed in a tone that made Jean look up curiously into his face
Why dont they find out who saw him last
she repeated
Somebody did
Somebody must have gone there with him
Lite do you know that Art Osgood came into town with his horse all in a lather of sweat and took the afternoon train yesterday
I saw him
I met him square in the middle of the street and he didnt even look at me
He was in a frightful hurry and he looked all upset
If I was the law Id leave dad alone and get after Art Osgood
He acted to me she added viciously exactly as if he were running away
He wasnt though
Jim told me Art was going to leave yesterday that was in the forenoon
Hes going to Alaskabeen planning it all spring
And Carl said he was with Art till Art left to catch the train
Somebody else from town here had seen him take the train and asked about him
No it wasnt Art
Well who was it then
Never before had Lite failed to tell Jean just what she wanted to know
He failed now and he went away as though he was glad to put distance between them
He did not know what to think
He did not want to think
Certainly he did not want to talk to Jean especially
For lies never came easily to the tongue of Lite Avery
It was all very well to tell Jean that he didnt know who it was he did tell her so and made his escape before she could read in his face the fear that he did know
It was not so easy to guard his fear from the keen eyes of his fellows with whom he must mingle and discuss the murder or else pay the penalty of having them suspect that he knew a great deal more about it than he admitted
Several men tried to stop him and talk about it but he put them off
He was due at the ranch he said to look after the stock
He didnt know a thing about it anyway
Lazy A coulee when he rode into it seemed to wear already an air of depression foretaste of what was to come
The trail was filled with hoofprints and cut deep with the wagon that had borne the dead man to town and to an unwept burial
At the gate he met Carl Douglas riding with his head sunk deep on his chest
Lite would have avoided that meeting if he could have done so unobtrusively but as it was he pulled up and waited while Carl opened the wire gate and dragged it to one side
From the look of his face Carl also would have avoided the meeting if he could have done so
He glanced up as Lite passed through
Hell of a verdict Lite made brief comment when he met Carls eyes
Carl stopped leaning against his horse with one hand thrown up to the saddlehorn
He was a small man not at all like Aleck in size or in features
He looked haggard now and white
What do you make of it
he asked Lite
Do you believe
Of course I dont
Great question for a brother to ask Lite retorted sharply
Its not in Aleck to do a thing like that
What made you say you saw him ride home
You didnt did you
You heard what I said take it or leave it
Lite scowled down at Carl
What was there queer about it
Why If youd been inside ten minutes before then Carl told him bluntly youd have heard Aleck say he came home a full hour or more before you say you saw him ride in
Thats whats queer
What made you do that
It wont help Aleck none
Well what are you going to do about it
Lite slouched miserably in the saddle and eyed the other without really seeing him at all
They cant prove anything on Aleck he added with faint hope
I dont see myself how they can
Carl brightened perceptibly
His being alone all day is bad he cant furnish the alibi you can furnish
But they cant prove anything
Theyll turn him loose the grand jury will theyll have to
They cant indict him on the evidence
They havent got any evidencenot any more than just the fact that he rode in with the news
No need to worry hell be turned loose in a few days
He picked up the gate dragged it after him as he went through and fumbled the wire loop into place over the post
I wish he said when he had mounted with the gate between them you hadnt been so particular to say you saw him ride home about the same time you did
That looks bad Lite
Bad for who
Lite turned in the saddle aggressively
Looks bad all around
I dont see what made you do thatnot when you knew Jim and Aleck had both testified before you did
Lite rode slowly down the road to the stable and cursed the impulse that had made him blunder so
He had no compunctions for the lie if only it had done any good
It had done harm he could see now that it had
But he could not believe that it would make any material difference in Alecks case
As the story had been repeated to Lite by half a dozen men who had heard him tell it Alecks own testimony had been responsible for the verdict
Men had told Lite plainly that Aleck was a fool not to plead selfdefense even in face of the fact that Johnny Croft had not drawn any weapon
Jim had declared that Aleck could have sworn that Johnny reached for his gun
Others admitted voluntarily that while it would be a pretty weak defense it would beat the story Aleck had told
Lite turned the mare and colt into a shed for the night
He milked the two cows without giving any thought to what he was doing and carried the milk to the kitchen door before he realized that it would be wasted sitting in pans when the house would be empty
Still it occurred to him that he might as well go on with the routine of the place until they knew to a certainty what the grand jury would do
So he went in and put away the milk
After that Lite let other work wait while he cleaned the kitchen and tried to wash out that brown stain on the floor
His face was moody his eyes dull with trouble
Like a treadmill his mind went over and over the meager knowledge he had of the tragedy
He could not bring himself to believe Aleck Douglas guilty of the murder yet he could not believe anything else
Johnny Croft it had been proven at the inquest rode out from town alone bent on mischief if vague halfdrunken threats meant anything
He had told more than one that he was going to the Lazy A but it was certain that no one had followed him from town
His threats had been for the most part directed against Carl it is true but if he had meant to quarrel with Carl he would have gone to the Bar Nothing instead of the Lazy A
Probably he had meant to see both Carl and Aleck and had come here first since it was the nearest to town
As to enemies no one had particularly liked Johnny
He was not a likeable sort he was too mouthy according to his associates
He had quarreled with a good many for slight cause but since he was so notoriously blatant and argumentative no one had taken him seriously enough to nurse any grudge that would be likely to breed assassination
It was inconceivable to Lite that any man had trailed Johnny Croft to the Lazy A and shot him down in the kitchen while he was calmly helping himself to Jeans gingerbread
Still he must take that for granted or else believe what he steadfastly refused to confess even to himself that he believed
It was nearly dark when he threw out the last pail of water and stood looking down dissatisfied at the result of his labor while he dried his hands
The stain was still there in spite of him just as the memory of the murder would cling always to the place
He went out and watered Jeans poppies and sweet peas and pansies still going over and over the evidence and trying to fill in the gaps
He had blundered with his lie that had meant to help
The lie had proven to every man who heard him utter it that his faith in Alecks innocence was not strong it had proven that he did not trust the facts
That hurt Lite and made it seem more than ever his task to clear up the matter if he could
If he could not then he would make amends in whatever way he might
Almost as if he were guarding that gruesome room which was empty now and silentsince the clock had not been wound and had run downhe sat long upon the narrow platform before the kitchen door and smoked and stared straight before him
Once he thought he saw a man move cautiously from the corner of the shed where the youngest calf slept beside its mother He had been thinking so deeply of other things that he was not sure but he went down there his cigarette glowing in the gloom and stood looking and listening
He neither saw nor heard anything and presently he went back to the house but his abstraction was broken by the fancy so that he did not sit down again to smoke and think
He had thought until his brain felt heavy and stupid and the last cigarette he lighted he threw away for he had smoked until his tongue was sore
He went in and went to bed
For a long time he lay awake
Finally he dropped into a sleep so heavy that it was nearer to a torpor and it was the sunlight that awoke him sunlight that was warm in the room and proved how late the morning was
He swore in his astonishment and got up hastily a great deal more optimistic than when he had lain down and hurried out to feed the stock before he boiled coffee and fried eggs for himself
It was when he went in to cook his belated breakfast that Lite noticed something which had no logical explanation
There were footprints on the kitchen floor that he had scrubbed so diligently
He stood looking at them much as he had looked at the stain that would not come out no matter how hard he scrubbed
He had not gone in the room after he had pulled the door shut and gone off to water Jeans dowers
He was positive upon that point and even if he had gone in his tracks would scarcely have led straight across the room to the cupboard where the table dishes were kept
The tracks led to the cupboard and were muddled confusedly there as though the maker had stood there for some minutes
Lite could not see any sense in that
They were very distinct just as footprints always show plainly on clean boards
The floor had evidently been moist stillLite had scrubbed manfashion with a broom and had not been very particular about drying the floor afterwards
Also he had thrown the water straight out from the door and the fellow must have stepped on the moist sand that clung to his boots
In the dark he could not notice that or see that he had left tracks on the floor
Lite went to the cupboard and looked inside it wondering what the man could have wanted there
It was one of those oldfashioned safes such as our grandmothers considered indispensable in the furnishing of a kitchen
It held the table dishes neatly piled dinner plates at the end of the middle shelf smaller plates next then a stack of saucersthe arrangement stereotyped unvarying since first Lite Avery had taken dishtowel in hand to dry the dishes for Jean when she was ten and stood upon a footstool so that her elbows would be higher than the rim of the dishpan
The cherry blossom dinner set that had come from the mailorder house long ago was chipped now and incomplete but the familiar rows gave Lite an odd sense of the unreality of the tragedy that had so lately taken place in that room
Clearly there was nothing there to tempt a thief and there was nothing disturbed
Lite straightened up and looked down thoughtfully upon the top of the cupboard where Jean had stacked outofdate newspapers and magazines and where Aleck had laid a pair of extra gloves
He pulled out the two small drawers just under the cupboard top and looked within them
The first held pipes and sacks of tobacco and books of cigarette papers Lite knew well enough the contents of that drawer
He appraised the supply of tobacco remembered how much had been there on the morning of the murder and decided that none had been taken
He helped himself to a fresh tencent sack of tobacco and inspected the other drawer
Here were merchants bills a few letters of no consequence a couple of writing tablets two lead pencils and a steel pen and a squat bottle of ink
This was called the writingdrawer and had been since Lite first came to the ranch
Here Lite believed the confusion was recent
Jean had been very domestic since her return from school and all disorder had been frowned upon
Lately the letters had been stacked in a corner whereas now they were scattered
But they were of no consequence once they had been read and there was nothing else to merit attention from any one
Lite looked down at the tracks and saw that they led into another room which was Alecks bedroom
He went in there but he could not find any reason for a nightprowlers visit
Alecks desk was always open
There was never anything there which he wanted to hide away
His account books and his business correspondence such as it was lay accessible to the curious
There was nothing intricate or secret about the running of the Lazy A ranch nothing that should interest any one save the owner
It occurred to Lite that incriminating evidence is sometimes placed surreptitiously in a suspected mans desk
He had heard of such things being done
He could not imagine what evidence might be placed here by any one but he made a thorough search
He did not find anything that remotely concerned the murder
He looked through the livingroom and even opened the door which led from the kitchen into Jeans room which had been built on to the rest of the house a few years before
He could not find any excuse for those footprints
He cooked and ate his breakfast absentmindedly glancing often down at the footprints on the floor and occasionally at the brown stain in the center
He decided that he would not say anything about those tracks
He would keep his eyes open and his mouth shut and see what came of it
CHAPTER III WHAT A MANS GOOD NAME IS WORTH You would think that the bare word of a man who has lived uprightly in a community for fifteen years or so would be believed under oath even if his whole future did depend upon it
You would think that Aleck Douglas could not be convicted of murder just because he had reported that a man was shot down in Alecks house
The report of Aleck Douglas trial is not the main feature of this story it is merely the commencement one might say
Therefore I am going to be brief as I can and still give you a clear idea of the situation and then I am going to skip the next three years and begin where the real story begins
Alecks position was dishearteningly simple and there was nothing much that one could do to soften the facts or throw a new light on the murder
Lite watched wide awake and eager many a night for the return of that prowler but he never saw or heard a thing that gave him any clue whatever
So the footprints seemed likely to remain the mystery they had seemed on the morning when he discovered them
He laid traps pretending to ride away from the ranch to town before dark and returning cautiously by way of the trail down the bluff behind the house
But nothing came of it
Lazy A ranch was keeping its secret well and by the time the trial was begun Lite had given up hope
Once he believed the house had been visited in the daytime during his absence in town but he could not be sure of that
Jean went to Chinook and stayed there so that Lite saw her seldom
Carl also was away much of the time trying by every means he could think of to swing public opinion and the evidence in Alecks favor
He prevailed upon Rossman who was Montanas bestknown lawyer to defend the case for one thing
He seemed to pin his faith almost wholly upon Rossman and declared to every one that Aleck would never be convicted
It would be he maintained impossible to convict him with Rossman handling the case and he always added the statement that you cant send an innocent man to jail if things are handled right
Perhaps he did not after all handle things right
For in spite of Rossman and Alecks splendid reputation and the meager evidence against him he was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years in Deer Lodge penitentiary
Rossman had made a great speech and had made men in the jury blink back unshed tears
But he could not shake from them the belief that Aleck Douglas had ridden home and met Johnny Croft calmly making himself at home in the Lazy A kitchen
He could not convince them that there had not been a quarrel and that Aleck had not fired the shot in the grip of a sudden overwhelming rage against Croft
By Alecks own statement he had been at the ranch some time before he had started for town to report the murder
By the word of several witnesses it had been proven that Croft had left town meaning to collect wages which he claimed were due him or else he would get even
His last words to a group out by the hitching pole in front of the saloon which was Johnnys hangout were Im going to get whats coming to me or therell be one fine large bunch of trouble
He had not mentioned Aleck Douglas by name it is true but the fact that he had been found at the Lazy A was proof enough that he had referred to Aleck when he spoke
There is no means of knowing just how farreaching was the effect of that impulsive lie which Lite had told at the inquest
He did not repeat the blunder at the trial
When the district attorney reminded Lite of the statement he had made Lite had calmly explained that he had made a mistake he should have said that he had seen Aleck ride away from the ranch instead of to it
Beyond that he would not go question him as they might
The judge sentenced Aleck to eight years and publicly regretted the fact that Aleck had persisted in asserting his innocence had he pleaded guilty instead the judge more than hinted the sentence would have been made as light as the law would permit
It was the stubborn denial of the deed in the face of all reason he said that went far toward weaning from the prisoner what sympathy he would otherwise have commanded from the public and the court of justice
You know how those things go
There was nothing particularly out of the ordinary in the case we read of such things in the paper and a paragraph or two is considered sufficient space to give so commonplace a happening
But there was Lite loyal to his last breath in the face of his secret belief that Aleck was probably guilty loyal and blaming himself bitterly for hurting Alecks cause when he had meant only to help
There was Jean dazed by the magnitude of the catastrophe that had overtaken them all clinging to Lite as to the only part of her home that was left to her steadfastly refusing to believe that they would actually take her dad away to prison until the very last minute when she stood on the crowded depot platform and watched in dryeyed misery while the train slid away and bore him out of her life
These things are not put in the papers
Come on Jean
Lite took her by the arm and swung her away from the curious crowd which she did not see
Youre my girl now and Im going to start right in using my authority
Ive got Pard here in the stable
You go climb into your ridingclothes and well hit it outa this darned burg where every man and his dog has all gone to eyes and tongues
They make me sick
Come on
Where
Jean held back a little with vague stubbornness against the thought of taking up life again without her dad
Thisthis is the jumpingoff place Lite
Theres nothing beyond
Lite gripped her arm a little tighter if anything and led her across the street and down the high sidewalk that bridged a swampy tract at the edge of town beyond the depot
Were taking the long way round he observed because Im going to talk to you like a Dutch uncle for saying things like that
Ihad a talk with your dad last night Jean
Hes turned you over to me to look after till he gets back
I wish he coulda turned the ranch over along with you but he couldnt
Thats been signed over to Carl somehow I didnt go into that with your dad we didnt have much time
Seems Carl put up the money to pay Rossmanand other thingsand took over the ranch to square it
Anyway I havent got anything to say about the business end of the deal
Ive got permission to boss you though and Im sure going to do it to a fareyouwell
He cast a sidelong glance down at her
He could not see anything of her face except the droop of her mouth a bit of her cheek and her chin that promised firmness
Her mouth did not change expression in the slightest degree until she moved her lips in speech
I dont care
What is there to boss me about
The world has stopped
Her voice was steady and it was also sullen
Right there is where the need of bossing begins
You cant stay in town any longer
Theres nothing here to keep you from going crazy and the Allens are altogether too sympathetic nice folks and they mean wellbut you dont want a bunch like that slopping around crying all over you and keeping you in mind of things
Im going to work for Carl from now on
Youre going out there to the Bar Nothing He felt a stiffening of the muscles under his fingers and answered calmly the signal of rebellion
Sure thats the place for you
Your dad and Carl fixed that up between them anyway
Thats to be your home so my saying so is just an extra rope to bring you along peaceable
Youre going to stay at the Bar Nothing
And Im going to make a top hand outa you Jean
Im going to teach you to shoot and rope and punch cows and ride till there wont be a girl in the United States to equal you
What for
Jean still had an air of sullen apathy
That wont help dad any
Itll start the world moving again
Lite forced himself to cheerfulness in the face of his own despondency
You say its stopped
Its us that have stopped
Weve come to a blind pocket you might say in the trail weve been taking through life
Weve got to start in a new place thats all
Now I know youre dead game Jean at least I know you used to be and Im gambling on school not taking that outa you
Youre maybe thinking about going away off somewhere among strangers but that wouldnt do at all
Your dad always counted on keeping you away from town life
Im just going to ride herd on you Jean and see to it that you go on the way your dad wanted you to go
He cant be on the job and so Im what you might call his foreman
I know how he wants you to grow up Im going to make it my business to grow you according to directions
He saw a little quirk of her lips at that and was vastly encouraged thereby
Has it struck you that youre liable to have your hands full
she asked him with a certain drawl that Jean had possessed since she first learned to express herself in words
Sure
Ill likely have both hand and my hat full of trouble
But shes going to be done according to contract
I reckon Ill wish you was a bronk before Im through What maddens me so that I could run amuck down this street shooting everybody I saw Jean flared out suddenly is the sickening injustice of it
Dad never did that you know he never did it
She turned upon him fiercely
Do you think he did
she demanded her eyes boring into his
Now thats a bright question to be asking me aint it
Lite rebuked
Thats a real bright sensible question I must say
I reckon you ought to be stood in the corner for thatbut Ill let it go this time
Only dont never spring anything like that again
Jean looked ashamed
I could doubt God Himself right now she gritted through her teeth
Well dont doubt me unless you want a scrap on your hands Lite warned
Im sure ashamed of you
Well stop here at the stable and get the horses
You can ride sideways as far as the Allens and get your ridingskirt and come on
The sooner you are on top of a horse the quicker youre going to come outa that state of mind
It was pitifully amusing to see Lite Avery attempt to bully any oneespecially Jeanwho might almost be called Lites religion
The idea of that long lank cowpuncher whose shyness was so ingrained that it had every outward appearance of being a phlegmatic coldness assuming the duties of Jeans dad and undertaking to see that she grew up according to directions would have been funny if he had not been so absolutely in earnest
His method of comforting her and easing her through the first stage of black despair was unorthodox but it was effective
Because she was too absorbed in her own misery to combat him openly he got her started toward the Bar Nothing and away from the friends whose enervating pity was at that time the worst influence possible
He set the pace and he set it for speed
The first mile they went at a sharp gallop that was not far from a run and the horses were breathing heavily when he pulled up well out of sight of the town and turned to the girl
There was color in her cheeks and the dullness was gone from her eyes when she returned his glance inquiringly
The droop of her lips was no longer the droop of a weak yielding to sorrow but rather the beginning of a brave facing of the future
Lite managed a grin that did not look forced
Ill make a real range hand outa you yet he announced confidently
You remember the roping and shooting science I taught you before you went off to school
Youre going to start right in where you left off and learn all I know and some besides
Ill make a lady of you yetdarned if I dont
At that Jean laughed unexpectedly
Lite drew a long breath of relief
CHAPTER IV
JEAN The still loneliness of desertion held fast the clutter of sheds and old stables roofed with dirt and rotting hay
The melancholy of emptiness hung like an invisible curtain before the sprawling house with warped weatherblackened shingles and sagging windowframes
You felt the silence when first you sighted the ranch buildings from the broad mouth of the Lazy A couleethe broad mouth that yawned always at the narrow valley and the undulations of the open range and the purple line of mountains beyond
You felt it more strongly when you rode up to the gate of barbedwire spliced here and there and having an unexpected stubbornness to harry the patience of men who would pass through it in haste
You grew unaccountably depressed if you rode on past the stables and corrals to the house where the door was closed but never locked and opened with a squeal of rusty hinges if you turned the brown earthenware knob and at the same instant pressed sharply with your knee against the paintless panel
You might notice the brown spot on the kitchen door where a man had died you might notice the brown spot but unless you had been told the grim story of the Lazy A you would never guess the spot was a bloodstain
Even though you guessed and shuddered you would forget it presently in the amazement with which you opened the door beyond and looked in upon a room where the chill atmosphere of the whole place could find no lodgment
This was Jeans room held sacred to her own needs and uses in defiance of the dreariness that compassed it close
A square of old rag carpet covered the center of the floor and beyond its border the warped boards were painted a dull pale green
The walls were ugly with a cheap flowered paper that had done its best to fade into inoffensive neutral tints
Jean had helped where she could by covering the intricate rose pattern with old prints cut from magazines and with cheap pretty souvenirs gleaned here and there and hoarded jealously
And there were books which caught the eyes and held them even to forgetfulness of the paper
You would laugh at Jeans room
Just at first you would laugh after that you would want to cry or pat Jean on her hardmuscled capable shoulder but if you knew Jean at all you would not do either
First you would notice an old wooden cradle painted blue that stood in a corner
A buttoneyed blankfaced rag doll the size of a baby at the fistsucking age was tucked neatly under the redandwhite patchwork quilt made to fit the cradle
Hanging directly over the cradle by a stirrup was Jeans first saddlea cheap pigskin affair with harsh straps and buckles that her father had sent East for
Jean never had liked that saddle even when it was new
She used to stand perfectly still while her father buckled it on the little buckskin pony she rode and she would laugh when he picked her up and tossed her into the seat
She would throw her dad a kiss and go galloping off down the trailbut when she was quite out of sight around the bend of the benchland she would stop and take the saddle off and hide it in a certain clump of wild currant bushes and continue her journey bareback
A kitfox found it one day that is how the edge of the cantle came to have that queer chewed look
There was an old black wooden rocker with an oval picture of a ship under full sail just where Jeans brown head rested when she leaned back and stared bigeyed down the coulee to the hills beyond
There was an oldfashioned workbasket always full of stockings that never were mended and a crumpled dresser scarf which Jean had begun to hemstitch more than a year ago in a brief spasm of domesticity
There were magazines everywhere and you may be sure that Jean had read them all even to the soap advertisements and the sanitary kitchens and the vacuum cleaners
There was an old couch with a coarse Navajo rug thrown over it and three or four bright cushions that looked much used
And there were hair macartas and hackamores and two pairs of her fathers old spurs and her fathers stock saddle and chaps and slicker and hat and a jelly glass half full of rattlesnake rattles and her mothers old checked sunbonnetthe kind with pasteboard slats
Half the slats were broken
There was a guitar and an old old sewing machine with a reloading shotgun outfit spread out upon it
There was a desk made of boxes and on the desk lay a shotloaded quirt that more than one rebellious cowhorse knew to its sorrow
There was a rawhide lariat that had parted its strands in a tussle with a stubborn cow
Jean meant to fix the broken end of the longest piece and use it for a tierope some day when she had time and thought of it
Somewhere in the desk were verses which Jean had writtendozens of them and not nearly as bad as you might think
Jean laughed at them after they were written but she never burned them and she never spoke of them to any one but Lite who listened with fixed attention and a solemn appreciation when she read them to him
On the whole the room was contradictory
But Jean herself was somewhat contradictory and the place fitted her
Here was where she spent those hours when her absence from the Bar Nothing was left unexplained to any one save Lite
Here was where she drew into her shell when her Uncle Carl made her feel more than usually an interloper or when her Aunt Ellas burden of complaints and worry and headaches grew just a little too much for Jean
She never opened the door into the kitchen
There was another just beyond the sewingmachine that gave an intimate look into the face of the bluff which formed that side of the coulee wall
There were hollyhocks along the path that led to this door and stunted rosebushes which were kept alive with much mysterious assistance in the way of water and cultivation
There was a little spring just under the foot of the bluff where the trail began to climb and some young alders made a shady nook there which Jean found pleasant on a hot day
The rest of the house might be ratridden and desolate
The coulee might wear always the look of emptiness but here under the bluff by the spring and in the room Jean called hers one felt the air of occupancy that gave the lie to all around it
When she rode around the bold outthrust shoulder of the hill which formed the western rim of the coulee and went loping up the trail to where the barbedwire gate stopped her you would have said that Jean had not a trouble to call her own
She wore her old gray Stetson pretty well over one eye because of the sun glare and she was riding on one stirrup and letting the other foot swing free and she was whirling her quirt round and round cartwheel fashion and whistling an air that every one knowsand putting in certain complicated variations of her own
At the gate she dismounted without ever missing a note gave the warped stake a certain twist and jerk which loosened the wire loop so that she could slip it easily over the post passed through and dragged the gate with her dropping it flat upon the ground beside the trail
There was no stock anywhere in the coulee and she would save a little trouble by leaving the gate open until she came out on her way home
She stepped aside to inspect the meadow larks nest cunningly hidden under a wild rosebush and then mounted and went on to the stable still whistling carelessly
She turned Pard into the shed where she invariably left him when she came to the Lazy A and went on up the grassgrown path to the house
She had the preoccupied air of one who meditates deeply upon things apart as a matter of fact she had glanced down the coulee to its wideopen mouth and had thrilled briefly at the wordless beauty of the green spread of the plain and the hazy blue sweep of the mountains and had come suddenly into the poetic mood
She had even caught a phraseThe lazy line of the watchful hills it wasand she was trying to fit it into a verse and to find something beside rills that would rhyme with hills
She followed the path absentmindedly to where she would have to turn at the corner of the kitchen and go around to the door of her own room and until she came to the turn she did not realize what was jarring vaguely and yet insistently upon her mood
Then she knew and she stopped full and stared down at the loose sand just before the warped kitchen steps
There were footprints in the pathalien footprints and they pointed toward that forbidden door into the kitchen of gruesome memory
Jean looked up frowning and saw that the door had been opened and closed again carelessly
And upon the top step strange feet had pressed a little caked earth carried from the trail where she stood
There were the smallheeled pointed prints of a womans foot and there were the larger tracks of a mana man of the town
Jean stood with her quirt dangling loosely from her wrist and glanced back toward the stables and down the coulee
She completely forgot that she wanted a rhyme for hills
What were towns people doing here
And how did they get here
They had not ridden up the coulee there were no tracks through the gate and besides these were not the prints of ridingboots
She twitched her shoulders and went around to the door leading into her own room
The door stood wide open when it should have been closed
Inside there were evidences of curious inspection
She went hot with an unreasoning anger when she saw the wideopen door into the kitchen first of all she went over and closed that door her lips pressed tightly together
To her it was as though some wanton hand had forced up the lid of a coffin where slept her dead
She stood with her back against the door and looked around the room breathing quickly
She felt the womans foolish amusement at the old cradle with the rag doll tucked under the patchwork quilt and at her pitiful attempts at adorning the tawdry walls
Without having seen more than the prints of her shoes in the path Jean hated the woman who had blundered in here and had looked and laughed
She hated the man who had come with the woman
She went over to her desk and stood staring at the litter
A couple of sheets of cheap tablet paper whereon Jean had scribbled some verses of the range lay across the quirt she had forgotten on her last trip
They had prowled among the papers even
They had respected nothing of hers had considered nothing sacred from their inquisitiveness
Jean picked up the paper and read the verses through and her cheeks reddened slowly
Then she discovered something else that turned them white with fresh anger
Jean had an old ledger wherein she kept a sporadic kind of a diary which she had entitled More or Less the Record of my Sins
She did not write anything in it unless she felt like doing so when she did she wrote just exactly what she happened to think and feel at the time and she had never gone back and read what was written there
Some one else had read however at least the book had been pulled out of its place and inspected along with her other personal belongings
Jean had pressed the first windflowers of the season between the pages where she had done her last scribbling and these were crumpled and two petals broken so she knew that the book had been opened carelessly and perhaps read with that same brainless laughter
She did not say anything
She straightened the windflowers as best she could put the book back where it belonged and went outside and down to a lopsided shack which might pass anywhere as a junkshop
She found some nails and a hammer and after a good deal of rummaging and some sneezing because of the dust she raised whenever she moved a pile of rubbish she found a padlock with a key in it
More dusty search produced a hasp and some staples and then she went back and nailed two planks across the door which opened into the kitchen
After that she fastened the windows shut with nails driven into the casing just above the lower sashes and cracked the outer door with twelve penny nails which she clinched on the inside with vicious blows of the hammer so that the hasp could not be taken off without a good deal of trouble
She had pulled a great staple off the door of a useless boxstall and when she had driven it in so deep that she could scarcely force the padlock into place over the hasp and had put the key in her pocket she felt in a measure protected from future prowlers
As a final hint however she went back to the shop and mixed some paint with lampblack and oil and lettered a thin board which she afterwards carried up and nailed firmly across the outside kitchen door
Hammer in hand she backed away and read the words judicially her head tilted sidewise ONLY SNEAKS GO WHERE THEY ARE NOT WANTED
ARE YOU A SNEAK
The hint was plain enough
She took the hammer back to the shop and led Pard out of the stable and down to the gate her eyes watching suspiciously the trail for tracks of trespassers
She closed the gate so thoroughly with baling wire twisted about a stake that the next comer would have troubles of his own in getting it open again
She mounted and went away down the trail sitting straight in the saddle both feet in the stirrups head up and hat pulled firmly down to her very eyebrows glances going here and there alert antagonistic
No whistling this time of ragtime tunes with queer little variations of her own no twirling of the quirt instead Pard got the feel of it in a tender part of the flank and went clean over a narrow washout that could have been avoided quite easily
No groping for rhythmic phrasings to fit the beauty of the land she lived in Jean was in the mood to combat anything that came in her way
CHAPTER V JEAN RIDES INTO A SMALL ADVENTURE At the mouth of the coulee she turned to the left instead of to the right and so galloped directly away from the Bar Nothing ranch down the narrow valley known locally as the Flat and on to the hills that invited her with their untroubled lights and shadows and the deep scars she knew for canyons
There were no ranches out this way
The land was too broken and too barren for anything but grazing so that she felt fairly sure of having her solitude unspoiled by anything human
Solitude was what she wanted
Solitude was what she had counted upon having in that little room at the Lazy A robbed of it there she rode straight to the hills where she was most certain of finding it
And then she came up out of a hollow upon a little ridge and saw three horsemen down in the next coulee
They were not close enough so that she could distinguish their features but by the horses they rode by the swing of their bodies in the saddles by all those little indefinable marks by which we recognize acquaintances at a distance Jean knew them for strangers
She pulled up and watched them puzzled for a minute at their presence and behavior
When first she discovered them they were driving a small bunch of cattle mostly cows and calves down out of a little draw to the level bottom of the narrow coulee
While she watched herself screened effectually by a clump of bushes she saw one rider leave the cattle and gallop out into the open stand there looking toward the mouth of the coulee and wave his hand in a signal for the others to advance
This looked queer to Jean accustomed all her life to seeing men go calmly about their business upon the range careless of observation because they had nothing to conceal
She urged Pard a little nearer keeping well behind the bushes still and leaned forward over the saddle horn watching the men closely
Their next performance was enlightening but incredibly bold for the business they were engaged in
One of the three got off his horse and started a little fire of dry sticks under a convenient ledge
Another untied the rope from his saddle widened the loop swung it twice over his head and flipped it neatly over the head of a calf
Jean did not wait to see any more than that she did not need to see any more to know them for rustlers
Brazen rustlers indeed to go about their work in broad daylight like that
She was not sure as to the ownership of the calf but down here was where the Bar Nothing cattle and what few were left of the Lazy A ranged while the feed was good in the spring so that the probabilities were that this theft would strike rather close home
Whether it did or not Jean was not one to ride away and leave range thieves calmly at work
She turned back behind the bushy screen rode hastily along the ridge to the head of the little coulee and dismounted leading Pard down a steep bank that was treacherous with loose shale
The coulee was more or less open but it had convenient twists and windings and if you think that Jean failed to go down it quietly and unseen that merely proves how little you know Jean
She hurried as much as she dared
She knew that the rustlers would be in something of a hurry themselves and she very much desired to ride on them unawares and catch them at that branding so that there would be no shadow of a doubt of their guilt
What she would do after she had ridden upon them she did not quite know
So she came presently around the turn that revealed them to her
They were still fussing with the calf or it may have been another oneand did not see her until she was close upon them
When they did see her she had them covered with her 38caliber sixshooter that she usually carried with her on the chance of getting a shot at a coyote or a fox or something like that
The three stood up and stared at her their jaws sagging a little at the suddenness of her appearance and their eyes upon the gun
Jean held it steady and she had all the look of a person who knew exactly what she meant and who meant business
She eyed them curiously noting the fact that they were strangers and cowboysthough of a type that she had never seen on the range
She glanced sharply at the beaded buckskin jacket of one of them and the high widebrimmed sombrero of another
Well she said at length turn your backs youve had a good look at me
Turnyourbacks I said
Now drop those guns on the ground
Walk straight ahead of you till you come to that bank
You neednt look around Im still here
She leaned a little sending Pard slowly forward until he was close to the sixshooters lying on the ground
She glanced down at them quickly and again at the men who stood an uneasy trio with their faces toward the wall except when they ventured a glance sidewise or back at her over one shoulder
She glanced at the cattle huddled in the narrow mouth of the draw behind them and saw that they were indeed Bar Nothing and Lazy A stock
The horses the three had been riding she did not remember to have seen before
Jean hesitated not quite knowing what she ought to do next
So far she had acted merely upon instincts born of her range life and training the rest would not be so easy
She knew she ought to have those guns at any rate so she dismounted still keeping the three in line with her own weapon and went to where the revolvers lay on the ground
With her boot toe she kicked them close together and stooped and picked one up
The last man in the line turned toward her protestingly and Jean fired so close to his head that he ducked
Believe me I could kill the three of you if I wanted to before you could turn around she informed them calmly so you had better stand still till I tell you to move
She frowned down at the rustlers gun in her hand
There was something queer about that gun
Hey Burns called the man in the middle without venturing to turn his head come out of there and explain to the lady
This aint in the scene
Oh yes it is
a voice retorted chucklingly
You bet your life this is in the scene
Lowrys been pamming it all in dont you worry about that
Jean was startled but she did not lower her gun from its steady aiming at the three of them
It was just some trick very likely meant to throw her off her guard
There were more than the three and the fourth man probably had her covered with a gun
But she would not turn her head toward his voice for all that
The gentleman called Burns may walk out into the open and explain if he can she announced sharply her eyes upon the three whom she had captured so easily
She heard the throaty chuckle again from somewhere to the left of her
She saw the three men in front of her look at each other with sickly grins
She felt that the whole situation was swinging against herthat she had somehow blundered and made herself ridiculous
It never occurred to her that she was in any particular danger men did not shoot down women in that country unless they were drunk or crazy and the man called Burns had sounded extremely sane humorous even
She heard a rattle of bushes and the soft crunching of footsteps coming toward her
Still she would not turn her head nor would she lower the gun if it was a trick they should not say that it had been successful
Its all right sister said the chuckling voice presently almost at her elbow
This isnt any real honesttoJohn bandit party
Were just movie people and were making pictures
Thats all
He stopped but Jean did not move or make any reply whatever so he went on
I must say I appreciate the compliment you paid us in taking it for the real dope sister Dont call me sister again
Jean flashed him a sidelong glance of resentment
Youve already done it twice too often
Come around in front where I can see you if youre what you claim to be
Well dont shoot and I will soothed the chuckling voice
My my it certainly is a treat to see a real live Prairie Queen once
Beats making them to order Well omit the superfluous chatter please
Jean looked him over and tagged him mentally with one glance
He did not look like a rustlerwith his fat goodnature and his townbred personality and his gray tweed suit and pigskin puttees and the big cameo ring on his manicured little finger and his freshshaven face as round as the sun above his head and almost as cheerful
Perfectly harmless but Jean would not yield to the extent of softening her glance or her manner one hundredth of a degree
The more harmless these people the more ridiculous she had made herself appear
The chuckly one grinned and removed his soft gray hat held it against his generous equator and bowed so low as to set him puffing a little afterward
His eyes however appraised her shrewdly
Omitting all superfluous chatter as you suggest I am Robert Grant Burns of the Great Western Film Company
These men are also members of that company
We are here for the purpose of making Western pictures and this little bit of unlawful branding of stock which you were flattering enough to mistake for the real thing is merely a scene which we were making
He was about to indulge in what he would have termed a little kidding of the girl but wisely refrained after another shrewd reading of her face
Jean looked at the three men who had taken it for granted that they might leave their intimate study of the clay bank and were coming toward her
She looked at the gun she had picked up from the groundbeing loaded with blank cartridges was what had made it look so queerand at Robert Grant Burns of the Great Western Film Company who had put on his hat again and was studying her the way he was wont to study applicants for a position in his company
Did you get permission to haze our cattle around like this
she asked abruptly to hide how humiliated she really felt
Whyno
Just for a few scenes I did not consider it necessary
Plainly the chuckly Mr Burns was taken at a disadvantage
But it is necessary
Dont make the mistake Mr Burns of thinking this country and all it contains is at the disposal of any chance stranger just because we do not keep it under lock and key
You are making rather free with another mans personal property when you use my uncles cattle for your rustling scenes
Your uncle
Well I shall be very glad to make some arrangement with your uncle if that is customary
Why the doubt
Are you in the habit of walking into a mans house for instance and using his kitchen to make pictures without permission
Has it been your custom to lead a mans horses out of his stable whenever you chose and use them for race pictures
No nonothing like that
Sorry to have infringed upon your propertyrights I am sure
Mr Burns did not sound so chuckly now but that may have been because the three picturerustlers were quite openly pleased at the predicament of their director
It never occurred to me that That the cattle were not as free as the hills
The quiet voice of Jean searched out the tenderest places in the selfesteem of Robert Grant Burns
She tossed the blankloaded gun back upon the ground and turned to her horse
It does seem hard to impress it upon city people that we savages do have a few rights in this country
We should have policemen stationed on every hilltop I suppose and No Trespassing signs planted along every cowtrail
Even then I doubt whether we could convince some people that we are perfectly human and that we actually do own property here
While she drawled the last biting sentences she stuck her toe in the stirrup and went up into the saddle as easily as any cowpuncher in the country could have done
Robert Grant Burns stood with his hands at his hips and watched her with the critical eye of the expert who sees in every gesture a picture effective or ineffective good bad or merely soso
Robert Grant Burns had never in all his experience in directing Western pictures seen a girl mount a horse with such unconscious ease of every movement
Jean twitched the reins and turned towards him looking down at the little group with unfriendly eyes
I dont want to seem inhospitable or unaccommodating Mr Burns she told him but I fear that I must take these cattle back home with me
You probably will not want to use them any longer
Mr Burns did not say whether she was right or wrong in her conjecture
As a matter of fact he did want to use them for several more scenes but he stood silent while Jean with a chilly bow to the four of them sent Pard up the rough bank of the little gulley
Rather he made no reply to Jean but he waved his three rustlers back retreating himself to where the bank stopped them
And he turned toward the bushes that had at first hidden him from Jean waved his hand in an imperative gesture and called guardedly through cupped palms
Take that
All you can get of it
Which goes far to show why he was considered one of the best directors the Great Western Film Company had in its employ
So Jean unconsciously made a picture which caused the eyes of Robert Grant Burns to glisten while he watched
She ignored the men who had so fooled her and took down her rope that she might swing the loop of it toward the cattle and drive them back across the gulley and up the coulee toward home
Cattle are stubborn things at best and this little bunch seemed determined to seek the higher slopes
Put upon her mettle because of that little audience down below a mildly jeering audience at that she imaginedJean had need of her skill and her fifteen years or so of experience in handling stock
She swung her rope and shouted weaving back and forth across the gulley with little lunging rushes now and then to head off an animal that tried to bolt past her up the hill
She would not have glanced toward Robert Grant Burns to save her life and she did not hear him saying Great
Great stuff
Get it all Pete
By George you cant beat the real thing can you
J get that uphill dash
Good
Now panoram the drive up the gulleyget it ALL Peteturn as long as you can see the top of her hat
My Lord
You wouldnt get stuff like that in ten years
I wish Gay could handle herself like that in the saddle but there aint a leading woman in the business today that could put that over the way shes doing it
By George
Say Gil you get on your horse and ride after her and find out where she lives
We cant work any more now anyway shes gone off with the cattle
And say
You dont want to let her get a sight of you or she might take a shot at you
And if she can shoot the way she ridesgood night
CHAPTER VI AND THE VILLAIN PURSUED HER The young man called Gilto avoid wasting time in saying Gilbert James Huntley mounted in haste and rode warily up the coulee some distance behind Jean
At that time and in that locality he was quite anxious that she should not discover him
Gil was not such a bad fellow even though he did play heavies in all the pictures which Robert Grant Burns directed
A villain he was on the screen and a bad one
Manys the man he had killed as cold bloodedly as the Board of Censorship would permit
Manys the girlish Western heart he had broken and manys the time he had paid the penalty to brother father or sweetheart as the scenario of the play might decree
Manys the time he had followed girls and men warily through brushfringed gullies and over picturesque ridges for the entertainment of shop girls and their escorts sitting in darkened theaters and watching breathlessly the wicked deeds of Gilbert James Huntley
But in his everyday life Gil Huntley was very good looking very goodnatured and very harmless
His position and his salary as heavy in the Great Western Company he owed chiefly to his good acting and his thick eyebrows and his facility for making himself look treacherous and mean
He followed Jean because the boss told him to do so in the first place
In the second place he followed her because he was even more interested in her than his director had been and he hoped to have a chance to talk with her
In his work aday life Gil Huntley was quite accustomed to being discovered in some villainy and to having some man or woman point a gun at him with more or less antagonism in voice and manner
But he had never in his life had a girl ride up and throw down on him with a gun actually believing him to be a thief and a scoundrel whom she would shoot if she thought it necessary
There was a difference
Gil did not take the time or trouble to analyze the difference but he knew that he was glad the boss had not sent Johnny or Bill in his place
He did not believe that either of them would have enough sense to see the difference and they might offend her in some waythough Gil Huntley need not have worried in the least over any mans treatment of Jean who was eminently qualified to attend to that for herself
He grinned when he saw her turn the cattle loose down the very next coulee and with a final flip of her rope loop toward the hindermost cow ride on without them
He should have ridden in haste then to tell Robert Grant Burns that the cattle could be brought back in twenty minutes or so and the picturemaking go on as planned
It was not likely that the girl would come back they could go on with their work and get permission from the girls uncle afterward
But he did not turn and hurry back
Instead he waited behind a rockhuddle until Jean was well out of sight and while he waited he took his handkerchief and rubbed hard at the makeup on his face which had made him look sinister and boldly bad
Without mirror or cold cream he was not very successful so that he rode on somewhat spotted in appearance and looking even more sinister than before
But he was much more comfortable in his mind which meant a good deal in the interview which he hoped by some means to bring about
With Jean a couple of hundred yards in advance they crossed a little flat so bare of concealment that Gil Huntley was worried for fear she might look back and discover him
But she did not turn her head and he rode on more confidently
At the mouth of Lazy A coulee just where stood the cluster of huge rocks that had at one time come hurtling down from the higher slopes and the clump of currant bushes beneath which Jean used to hide her muchdespised saddle when she was a child she disappeared from view
Gil knowing very little of the ways of the range folk and less of the country kicked his horse into a swifter pace and galloped after her
Fifty yards beyond the currant bushes he heard a sound and looked back and there was Jean riding out from her hidingplace and coming after him almost at a run
While he was trying to decide what to do about it she overtook him rather the wide loop of her rope overtook him
He ducked but the loop settled over his head and shoulders and pulled tight about the chest
Jean took two turns of the rope around the saddle horn and then looked him over critically
In spite of herself she smiled a little at his face streaked still with grease paint and at his eyes staring at her from between heavily penciled lids
Thats what you get for following she said after a minute of staring at each other
Did you think I didnt know you were trailing along behind me
I saw you before I turned the cattle loose but I just let you think you were being real sly and cunning about it
You did it in real movingpicture style did your fat Mr Robert Grant Burns teach you how
What is the idea anyway
Were you going to abduct me and lead me to the swarthy chief of your gang or band or whatever you call it
Having scored a point against him and so put herself into a good humor again Jean laughed at him and twitched the rope just to remind him that he was at her mercy
To be haughtily indignant with this honest eyed embarrassed young fellow with the streaky face and heavilypenciled eyelids was out of the question
The wind caught his high peakedcrowned sombrero and sent it sailing like a great flapping bird to the ground and he could not catch it because Jean had his arms pinioned with the loop
She laughed again and rode over to where the hat had lodged
Gil Huntley to save himself from being dragged ignominiously from the saddle kicked his horse and kept pace with her
Jean leaned far over and picked up the hat and examined it with amusement
If you could just live up to your hat my wouldnt you be a villain though
she commented in a soft drawling voice
You dont look so terribly blood thirsty without it I just guess Id better keep it for a while
It would make a dandy wastebasket
Do you know if your face were clean I think youd look almost humanfor an outlaw
She started on up the trail nonchalantly leading her captive by the rope
Gil Huntley could have wriggled an arm loose and freed himself but he did not
He wanted to see what she was going to do with him
He grinned when she had her back turned toward him but he did not say anything for fear of spoiling the joke or offending her in some way
So presently Jean began to feel silly and the joke lost its point and seemed inane and weak
She turned back threw off the loop that bound his arms to his sides and coiled the rope
I wish you playacting people would keep out of the country she said impatiently
Twice youve made me act ridiculous
I dont know what in the world you wanted to follow me forand I dont care
Whatever it was it isnt going to do you one particle of good so you neednt go on doing it
She looked at him full refused to meet halfway the friendliness of his eyes tossed the hat toward him and wheeled her horse away
Goodby she said shortly and touched Pard with the spurs
She was out of hearing before Gil Huntley could think of the right thing to say and she increased the distance between them so rapidly that before he had quite recovered from his surprise at her sudden change of mood she was so far away that he could not have overtaken her if he had tried
He watched her out of sight and rode back to where Burns mouthed a big black cigar and paced up and down the level space where he had set the interrupted scene and waited his coming
Rode away from you did she
Whered she take the cattle to
Left em in the next gulch
Well why didnt you say so
You boys can bring em back and well get to work again
Whered you say that spring was Gil
Well eat before we do anything else
One thing about this blamed country is we dont have to be afraid of the light
Got to hand it to em for having plenty of good clear sunlight anyway
He followed Gil to the feeble spring that seeped from under a huge boulder and stooped uncomfortably to fill a tin cup
While he waited for the trickle to yield him a drink he cocked his head sidewise and looked up quizzically at his heavy
You must have come within speaking distance Gil he guessed shrewdly
Got any makeup along
You look like a mild case of the measles right now
What did she have to say anyhow
Nothing said Gil shortly
I didnt talk to her at all
I didnt want to run my horse to death trying to say hello when she didnt want it that way
Huh
grunted Robert Grant Burns unbelievingly and fished a bit of grass out of the cup with his little finger
He drank and said no more
CHAPTER VII ROBERT GRANT BURNS GETS HELP You know the brand dont you
the proprietor of the hotel which housed the Great Western Company asked with the tolerant air which the sophisticated wear when confronted by ignorance
Easy enough to locate the outfit by the cattle brand
What was it
Whereupon Robert Grant Burns rolled his eyes helplessly toward Gil Huntley
I noticed it at the time butwhat was that brand Gil
And Gil if you would believe me did not remember either
He had driven the cattle half a mile or more had helped to steal two calves out of the little herd and yet he could not recall the mark of their owner
So the proprietor of the hotel an old cowman who had sold out and gone into the hotel business when the barbedwire came by carloads into the country pulled a newspaper towards him borrowed a pencil from Burns and sketched all the cattle brands in that part of the country
While he drew one after the other he did a little thinking
Must have been the Bar Nothing or else the Lazy A cattle you got hold of he concluded pointing to the pencil marks on the margin of the paper
They range down in there and Jean Douglas answers your description of the girlas far as looks go
She aint all that wild and dangerous though
Swing a loop with any man in the country and ride and all that been raised right out there on the Lazy A
Say
Why dont you go out and see Carl Douglas and see if you cant get the use of the Lazy A for your pictures
Seems to me thats just the kinda place you want
Dont anybody live there now
Its been left alone ever sincethe trouble out there
House and barns and corralseverything you want
He leaned closer with a confidential tone creeping into his voice for Robert Grant Burns and his company were profitable guests and should be given every inducement to remain in the country
It aint but fifteen miles out there you could go back and forth in your machine easy
You go out and see Carl Douglas anyway wont do no harm
You offer him a little something for the use of the Lazy A hell take anything that looks like money
Take it from me thats the place you want to take your pictures in
And say
You want a written agreement with Carl
Have the use of his stock included or hell tax you extra
Have everything included advised the old cowman with a sweep of his palm and his voice lowered discreetly
Wont need to cost you much not if you dont give him any encouragement to expect much
Carls that kindgood fellow enoughbut he wantsthebigend
I know him you bet
And say
Dont let on to Carl that I steered you out there
Just claim like you was scouting around and seen the Lazy A ranch and took a notion to it not too much of a notion though or its liable to come kinda high
And say
Real enthusiasm for the idea began to lighten his eyes
If you want good range dope right out theres where you can sure find it
You play up to them Bar Nothing boysLite Avery and Joe Morris and Red
You ought to get some great pictures out there man
Them boys can sure ride and rope and handle stock if thats what you want and I reckon it is or you wouldnt be out here with your bunch of actors looking for the real stuff
They talked a long while after that
Gradually it dawned upon Burns that he had heard of the Lazy A ranch before though not by that euphonious title
It seemed worth investigating for he was going to need a good location for some exterior ranch scenes very soon and the place he had half decided upon did not alto gether please him
He inquired about roads and distances and waddled off to the hotel parlor to ask Muriel Gay his blond leading woman if she would like to go out among the natives next morning
Also he wanted her to tell him more about that picturesque place she and Lee Milligan had stumbled upon the day before the place which he suspected was none other than the Lazy A
That is how it came to pass that Jean riding out with big Lite Avery the next morning on a little private scoutingtrip of their own to see if that fat moving picture man was making free with the stock again met the man unexpectedly half a mile from the Bar Nothing ranchhouse
Along every trail which owns certain obstacles to swift easy passing there are places commonly spoken of as that place
In his journey to the Bar Nothing Robert Grant Burns had come unwarned upon that sandy hollow which experienced drivers approached with a mental bracing for the struggle ahead and with tightened lines and whip held ready
Even then they stuck fast as often as not if the load were heavy though Bar Nothing drivers gaged their loads with that hollow in mind
If they could pull through there without mishap they might feel sure of having no trouble elsewhere
Robert Grant Burns had come into the hollow unsuspectingly
He had been careening along the prairie road at a twentymile pace his mind fixed upon hurrying through his interview with Carl Douglas so that he would have time to stop at the Lazy A on the way back to town
He wanted to take a few exterior ranch house scenes that day for Robert Grant Burns was far more energetic than his bulk would lead one to suppose
He had Pete Lowry his camera man in the seat beside him
Back in the tonneau Muriel Gay and her mother who played the character parts clung to Lee Mulligan and a colorless individual who was Lowrys assistant and gave little squeals whenever the machine struck a bigger bump than usual
At the top of the hill which guarded the deceptive hollow Robert Grant Burns grinned over his shoulder at his characterwoman
Wait till we start back Ill know the road then and well do some traveling
he promised darkly and laid his toe lightly on the brake
It pleased him to be considered a daredevil driver that is why he always drove whatever machine carried him
They went lurching down the curving grade into the hollow and struck the patch of sand that had worn out the vocabularies of more eloquent men than he
Robert Grant Burns fed more gas and the engine kicked and groaned and sent the wheels bur rowing like moles to where the sand was deepest
Axles under they stuck fast
When Jean and Lite came loping leisurely down the hill the two women were fraying perfectly good gloves trying to pull rabbit brush up by the roots to make firmer foothold for the wheels
Robert Grant Burns was headandshoulders under the car digging badgerlike with his paws to clear the front axle and coming up now and then to wipe the perspiration from his eyes and puff the purple out of his complexion
Pete Lowry always ducked his head lower over the jack when he saw the heaving of flesh which heralded these resting times so that the boss could not catch him laughing
Lee Milligan was scooping sand upon the other side and mumbling to himself with a glance now and then at the trail in the hope of sighting a good samaritan with six or eight mules perhaps
Lee thought that it would take about that many mules to pull them out
The two riders pulled up smiling pityingly just as wellmounted riders invariably smile upon stalled automobilists
This was not the first machine that had come to grief in that hollow though they could not remember ever to have seen one sunk deeper in the sand
I guess you wouldnt refuse a little help about now Lite observed casually to Lee who was most in evidence
We wouldnt refuse a little but a lot is what we need Lee amended glumly
Any ranch within forty miles of here
We need about twelve good horses I should say
Lees experience with sand had been unhappy and his knowledge of what one good horse could do was slight
Shall we snake em out Jean
Lite asked her as if he himself were absolutely indifferent to their plight
Oh I suppose we might as well
We cant leave them blocking the trail somebody might want to drive past Jean told him in much the same tone just to tease Lee Milligan who was looking them over disparagingly
Well be blocking the trail a good long while if we stay here till you move us snapped Lee who was rather sensitive to tones
Then Robert Grant Burns gave a heave and a wriggle and came up for air and a look around
He had been composing a monologue upon the subject of sand and he had not noticed that strange voices were speaking on the other side of the machine
Hello sis Howdedo Miss he greeted Jean guardedly with a hasty revision of the terms when he saw how her eyebrows pinched together
I wonder if you could tell us where we can find teams to pull us out of this mess
I dont believe this old junkwagon is ever going to do it herself
How do you do Mr Burns
Lite and I offered to take you out on solid ground but your man seemed to think we couldnt do it
What man was that
Wasnt me anyway
I think you can do just about anything you start out to do if you ask me
Thank you chilled Jean and permitted Pard to back away from his approach
Say youre some rider he praised tactlessly and got no reply whatever
Jean merely turned and rode around to where Lite eased his long legs in the stirrups and waited her pleasure
Shall we help them out Lite
she asked distinctly
I think perhaps we ought to its a long walk to town
I guess we better wont take but a minute to tie on Lite agreed his fingers dropping to his coiled rope
Seems queer to me that folks should want to ride in them things when theres plenty of good horses in the country
No accounting for tastes Lite Jean replied cheerfully
Listen
If that thin man will start the enginehe doesnt weigh more than half as much as you do Mr Burnswell pull you out on solid ground
And if you have occasion to cross this hollow again I advise you to keep out there to the right
Theres a little sod to give your tires a better grip
Its rough but you could make it all right if you drive carefully and the bunch of you get out and walk
Dont try to keep around on the ridge theres a deep washout on each side so you couldnt possibly make it
We cant with the horses even
Jean did not know that there was a note of superiority in her voice when she spoke the last sentence but her listeners winced at it
Only Pete Lowry grinned while he climbed obediently into the machine to advance his spark and see that the gears were in neutral
Dont crank up till were ready
Lite expostulated
These cayuses of ours are pretty sensible and theyll stand for a whole lot but theres a limit
Wait till I get the ropes fixed before you start the engine
And the rest of you all be ready to give the wheels a lift
Youre in pretty deep
When Jean dismounted and hooked the stirrup over the horn so that she could tighten the cinch the eyes of Robert Grant Burns glistened at the picturestuff she made
He glanced eloquently at Pete and Pete gave a twisted smile and a pantomime of turning the cameracrank whereat Robert Grant Burns shook his head regretfully and groaned again
Say if I had a leading woman he began discontentedly and stopped short for Muriel Gay was standing quite close and even through her greasepaint makeup she betrayed the fact that she knew exactly what her director was thinking had seen and understood the gesture of the camera man and was close to tears because of it all
Muriel Gay was a conscientious worker who tried hard to please her director
Sometimes it seemed to her that her director demanded impossibilities of her that he was absolutely soulless where pictureeffects were concerned
Her riding had all along been a subject of discord between them
She had learned to ride very well along the bridlepaths of Golden Gate Park but Robert Grant Burns seemed to expect her to ride well like this girl for instance which was unjust
One could not blame her for glaring jealously while Jean tightened the cinch and remounted tying her rope to the saddle horn all ready to pull with her muscles tensed for the coming struggle with the sandand perhaps with her horse as welland with every line of her figure showing how absolutely at home she was in the saddle and how sure of herself
Ive tied my rope Lite Jean drawled with a little laugh at what might happen
Lite turned his face toward her
You better not be warned
Things are liable to start apopping when that engine wakes up
Well then Ill want both hands for Pard
Ive taken a couple of halfhitches anyway
You folks want to be ready at the wheels Lite directed waiving the argument
When we start you all want to heaveho together
Good teamwork will do it
All set
he called to Jean when Pete Lowry bent his back to start the engine
Businessll be pickin up directly
All set replied Jean cheerfully
It seemed then that everything began to start at once and to start in different directions
The engine snorted and pounded so that the whole machine shook with ague
When Pete jumped in and threw in the clutch there was a backfire that sounded like the crack of doom
The two horses went wild as their riders had half expected them to do
They lunged away from the horror behind them and the slack ropes tightened with a jerk
Both were good rope horses and the strain of the ropes almost recalled them to sanity and their training at least they held the ropes tight for a few seconds so that the machine jumped ahead and veered toward the firmer soil beside the trail in response to Petes turn of the wheel
Then Pard looked back and saw the thing coming after him and tried to bolt
When he found that he could not because of the rope he bucked as he had not done since he was a halfbroken broncho
That started Lite Averys horse to pitching and Pete absorbed in watching what would have made a great picture forgot to shut off the gas
Robert Grant Burns picked himself out of the sand where he had sprawled at the first wild lunge of the machine and saw Pete Lowry humped over the wheel like any speed demon go lurching off across the hollow in the wake of two fearcrazed animals that threatened at any instant to bolt off at an angle that would overturn the car
Then Lite let his rope slip from the saddlehorn and spurred his horse to one side out of the danger zone of the other while he felt frantically in his pockets for his knife
Dont you cut my rope Jean warned when she saw him come plunging toward her knife in hand
This isfine trainingfor Pard
Pete came to himself then and killed the engine before he landed in the bottom of a yawning water washed hole and Lite rode close and slashed Jeans rope in spite of her protest whereupon Pard went off up the slope as though witches were riding him hard
At long rifle range he circled and faced the thing that had scared him so and after a little Jean persuaded him to go back as far as the trail
Nearer he would not stir so she waited there for Lite
Never even thanked us Lite grumbled when he came up his mouth stretched in a wide smile
That girl with the kalsomine on her face made remarks about folks butting in
And the fat man talked into his double chin dunno what all he was saying
Heres whats left of your rope
Ill get you another one Jean
I was afraid that gazabo was going to run over you is why I cut it
Whats the matter over there
Arent they glad theyre out of the sand
Jean held her horse quiet while she studied the buzzing group
Something busted
I guess we done some damage
Lite grinned and watched them over his shoulder
You neednt go any further with me Lite
That fat mans the one that had the cattle
I am going over to the ranch for awhile but dont tell Aunt Ella
She turned to ride on up the hill toward the Lazy A but stopped for another look at the perturbed motorists
Well anyway we snaked them out of the sand didnt we Lite
We sure did Lite chuckled
They dont seem thankful but I guess they aint any worse off than they was before
Anyway it serves them right
Theyve no business here acting fresh
Lite said that because he was not given the power to peer into the future and so could not know that Fate herself had sent Robert Grant Burns into their lives and that by a somewhat roundabout method she was going to use the Great Western Film Company and Jean and himself for her servants in doing a work which Fate had set herself to do
CHAPTER VIII JEAN SPOILS SOMETHING Jean found the padlock key where she had hidden it under a rock ten feet from the door and let herself into her room
The peaceful familiarity of its four walls and the cheerful patch of sunlight lying warm upon the faded rag carpet gave her the feeling of security and of comfort which she seldom felt elsewhere
She wandered aimlessly around the room brushing the dust from her books and straightening a tiny fold in the cradle quilt
She ran an investigative forefinger along the seat of her fathers saddle brought the finger away dusty pulled one of the stockings from the overflowing basket and used it for a dust cloth
She wiped and polished the stamped leather with a painstaking tenderness that had in it a good deal of yearning and finally left it with a gesture of hopelessness
She went next to her desk and fumbled the quirt that lay there still
Then she pulled out the old ledger picked up a pencil and began to write sitting on the arm of an old caneseated chair while she did so
As I told you before Jean never wrote anything in that book except when her moods demanded expression of some sort when she did write she said exactly what she thought and felt at the time
So if you are permitted to know what she wrote at this time you will have had a peep into Jeans hidden inner life that none of her world save Lite knew anything about
She wrote rapidly and she did not always take the trouble to finish her sentences properlyas if she never could quite keep pace with her thoughts
So this is what that page held when finally she slammed the book shut and slid it back into the desk I dont know whats the matter with me lately
I feel as if I wanted to shoot somebody or rob a bank or run awayI guess its the old trouble nagging at me
I KNOW dad never did it
I dont know why but I know it just the sameand I know Uncle Carl knows it too
Id like to take out his brain and put it into some scientific machine that would squeeze out his thoughtshope it wouldnt hurt himId give him ether maybe
What I want is money enough to buy back this place and the stock
I dont believe Uncle Carl spent as much defending dad as he claims he didnot enough to take the whole ranch anyway
If I had money Id find Art Osgood if I had to hunt from Alaska to Africadont believe he went to Alaska at all
Uncle Carl thinks so



Id like the price of that machine I helped drag out of the sandsome people can have anything they want but all I want is dad back and this place the way it was before



If I had any brains I could write something wonderful and be rich and famous and do the things I want to do but theres no profit in just feeling wonderful things if I could make the world see and feel what I see and feel when Im here or riding alone



If I could find Art Osgood I believe I could make him tellI know he knows something even if he didnt do it himself
I believe he didBut what can you do when youre a woman and havent any money and must stay where youre put and cant even get out and do the little you might do because somebody must have you around to lean on and tell their troubles to



I dont blame Aunt Ella so much but thank goodness I can do without a shoulder to weep on anyway
Whats life for if youve got to spend your days hopping round and round in a cage
It wouldnt be a cage if I could have dad backId be doing things for him all the time and that would make life worth while
Poor dadfour more years isI cant think about it
Ill go crazy if I do It was there that she stopped and slammed the book shut and pushed it back out of sight in the desk
She picked up her hat and gloves and went out with blurred eyes and began to climb the bluff above the little spring where a faint littleused trail led to the benchland above
By following a rock ledge to where it was broken and climbing through the crevice to where the trail marked faintly the way to the top one could in a few minutes leave the Lazy A coulee out of sight below and stand on a high level where the winds blew free from the mountains in the west to the mountains in the east
Some day it was predicted the benchland would be cut into squares and farmedsome day when the government brought to reality a longtalkedof irrigation project
But in the meantime the land lay unfenced and free
One could look far away to the north and at certain times see the smoke of passing trains through the valley off there
One could look south to the distant river bluffs and east and west to the mountains
Jean often climbed the bluff just for the wide outlook she gained
The cage did not seem so small when she could stand up there and tire her eyes with looking
Life did not seem quite so purposeless and she could nearly always find little whispers of hope in the winds that blew there
She walked aimlessly and yet with a subconscious purpose for ten minutes or so and her face was turned directly toward the eastern hills
She stopped on the edge of the bluff that broke abruptly there and sat down and stared at the soft purple of the hills and the soft green of the nearer slopes and at the peaceful blue of the sky arched over it all
Her eyes cleared of their troubled look and grew dreamy
Her mouth lost its tenseness and softened to a half smile
She was not looking now into the past that was so full of heartbreak but into the future as hope pictured it for her
She was seeing the Lazy A alive again and all astir with the business of life and her father saddling Sioux and riding out to look after the stock
She was seeing herself riding with himor else cooking the things he liked best for his dinner when he came back hungry
She sat there for a long long while and never moved
A sparrow hawk swooped down quite close to Jean and then shot upward with a little brown bird in its claws and startled her out of her castle building
She felt a hot anger against the hawk which was like the sudden grasp of misfortune and a quick sympathy with the bird which was like herself and dad caught unawares and held helpless
But she did not move and the hawk circled and came back on his way to the nestingplace in the trees along the creek below
He came quite close and Jean shot him as he lifted his wings for a higher flight
The hawk dropped head foremost to the grass and lay there crumpled and quiet
Jean put back her gun in its holster and went over to where the hawk lay
The little brown bird fluttered terrifiedly and gave a piteous small chirp when her hand closed over it and then lay quite still in her cupped palms and blinked up at her
Jean cuddled it up against her cheek and talked to it and pitied it and promised it much in the way of fat little bugs and a warm nest and her tender regard
For the hawk she had no pity nor a thought beyond the one investigative glance she gave its body to make sure that she had hit it where she meant to hit it
Lite had taught her to shoot like thatstraight and quick
Lite was a man who trimmed life down to the essentials and he had long ago impressed it upon her that if she could not shoot quickly and hit where she aimed there was not much use in her attempting to shoot at all
Jean proved by her scant interest in the hawk how well she had learned the lesson and how sure she was of hitting where she aimed
The little brown bird had been gashed in the breast by a sharp talon
Jean was much concerned over the wound even though it did not reach any vital organ
She was afraid of septic poisoning she told the bird but added comfortingly Thereyou neednt worry one minute over that
Im almost sure theres a bottle of peroxide down at the house that isnt spoiled
Well go and put some on it right away and then well go bughunting
I believe I know where theres the fattest juiciest bugs
She cuddled the bird against her cheek and started back across the wide point of the benchland to where the trail led down the bluff to the house
She was wholly absorbed in the trouble of the little brown bird and the trail following a crevice through the rocks and later winding along behind some scant bushes partially concealed the buildings and the house yard from view until one was well down into the coulee
So it was not until she was at the spring looking at the moist earth there for fat bugs for the bird that she had any inkling of visitors
Then she heard voices and went quickly around the corner of the house toward the sound
It seemed to her that she was lately fated to come plump into the middle of that fat Mr Burns unauthorized picturemaking
The first thing she saw when she rounded the corner was the camera perched high upon its tripod and staring at her with its one round eye and the humorouseyed Pete Lowry turning a crank at the side and counting in a whisper
Close beside her the two women were standing in animated argument which they carried on in undertones with many gestures to point their meaning
Hey youre in the scene
called Pete Lowry and abruptly stopped counting and turning the crank
Youre in the scene sister
Step over here to one side will you
The fat director waved his pink cameoed hand impatiently
An old bench had been placed beside the house under a window
Jean backed a step and sat down upon the bench and looked from one to the other
The two women glanced at her wideeyed and moved away with mutual embracings
Jean lifted her hands and looked at the soft little crest and beady eyes of the bird to make sure that it was not disturbed by these strangers before she gave her attention to the expostulating Mr Burns
Did I spoil something
she inquired casually and watched curiously the pulling of many feet of narrow film from the camera
About fifteen feet of good scene Pete Lowry told her dryly but with that queer half smile twisting his lips
Jean looked at him and decided that save for the company he kept which made of him a latent enemy she might like that lean man in the red sweater who wore a pencil over one ear and was always smiling to himself about something
But what she did was to cross her feet and murmur a sympathetic sentence to the little brown bird
Inwardly she resented deeply this bold trespass of Robert Grant Burns but she meant to guard against making herself ridiculous again
She meant to be sure of her ground before she ordered them off
The memory of her humiliation before the supposed rustlers was too vivid to risk a repetition of the experience
When youre thoroughly rested said Robert Grant Burns in the tone that would have shriveled the soul of one of his actors wed like to make that scene over
Thank you
I am pretty tired she said in that soft drawly voice that could hide so effectually her meaning
She leaned her head against the wall and gave a luxurious sigh and crossed her feet the other way
She believed that she knew why Robert Grant Burns was growing so red in the face and stepping about so uneasily and why the women were looking at her like that
Very likely they expected her to prove herself crude and uncivilized but she meant to disappoint them even while she made them all the trouble she could
She pushed back her hat until its crown rested against the rough boards and cuddled the little brown bird against her cheek again and talked to it caressingly
Though she seemed unconscious of his presence she heard every word that Robert Grant Burns was muttering to himself
Some of the words were plain mansized swearing if she were any judge of language
It occurred to her that she really ought to go and find that peroxide but she could not forego the pleasure of irritating this man
I always supposed that fat men were essentially sweettempered she observed to the world in general when the mutterings ceased for a moment
Gee
Id like to make that Pete Lowry said in an undertone to his assistant
Jean did not know that he referred to herself and the unstudied picture she made sitting there with her hat pushed back and the little bird blinking at her from between her cupped palms
But she looked at him curiously with an impulse to ask questions about what he was doing with that queerlooking camera and how he could inject motion into photography
While she watched he drew out a narrow gray strip of film and made mysterious markings upon it with the pencil which he afterwards thrust absentmindedly behind his ear
He closed a small door in the side of the camera placed his palm over the lens and turned the little crank several times around
Then he looked at Jean and from her to the director
Robert Grant Burns gave a sweeping downward gesture with both handsa gesture which his company knew welland came toward Jean
You may not know it he began in a repressed tone but were in a hurry
Weve got work to do
We aint here on any pleasure excursion and youll be doing me a favor by getting out of the scene so we can go on with our work
Jean sat still upon the bench and looked at him
I suppose so but why should I be doing you favors
You havent seemed to appreciate them so far
Of course I dislike to seem disobliging or anything like that but your tone and manner would not make any one very enthusiastic about pleasing you Mr Burns
In fact I dont see why you arent apologizing for being here instead of ordering me about as if I worked for you
This benchis my bench
This ranchis where I have lived nearly all my life
I hate to seem vain Mr Burns but at the same time I think it is perfectly lovely of me to explain that I have a right here and I consider myself an angel of patience and graciousness and many other rare virtues because I have not even hinted that you are once more taking liberties with other peoples property
She looked at him with a smile at the corners of her eyes and just easing the firmness of her lips as if the humor of the situation was beginning to appeal to her
If you would stop dancing about and let your naturally sweet disposition have a chance and would explain just why you are here and what you want to do and would ask me nicelyit might help you more than to get apoplexy over it
The two women exclaimed under their breaths to each other and moved farther away as if from an impending explosion
The assistant camera man gurgled and turned his back abruptly
Lee Milligan wandering up from the stables stopped and stared
No one within the knowledge of those present had ever spoken so to Robert Grant Burns no one had ever dreamed of speaking thus to him
They had seen him when rage had mastered him and for slighter cause it was not an experience that one would care to repeat
Robert Grant Burns walked up to Jean as if he meant to lift her from the bench and hurl her by sheer brute force out of his way
He stopped so close to her that his shadow covered her
Are you going to get out of the way so we can go on
he asked in the tone of one who gives a last merciful chance of escape from impending doom
Are you going to explain why youre here and apologize for your tone and manner which are extremely rude
Jean did not pay his rage the compliment of a glance at him
She was looking at the dainty beak of the little brown bird and was telling herself that she could not be bullied into losing control of herself
These two women should not have the satisfaction of calling her a crude ignorant country girl and Robert Grant Burns should not have the triumph of browbeating her into yielding one inch of ground
She forced herself to observe the wonderfully delicate feathers on the birds head
It seemed more content now in the little nest her two palms had made for it
Its heart did not flutter so much and she fancied that the tiny beadlike eyes were softer in their bright regard of her
Robert Grant Burns came to a pause
Jean sensed that he was waiting for some reply and she looked up at him
His hand was just reaching out to her shoulder but it dropped instead to his coat pocket and fumbled for his handkerchief
Her eyes strayed to Pete Lowry
He was looking upward with that measuring glance which belongs to his profession estimating the length of time the light would be suitable for the scene he had focussed
She followed his glance to where the shadow of the kitchen had crept closer to the bench
Jean was not stupid and she had passed through the various stages of the kodak fever she guessed what was in the mind of the operator and when she met his eyes full she smiled at him sympathetically
I should dearly love to watch you work she said to him frankly
But you see how it is Mr Burns hasnt got hold of himself yet
If he comes to his senses before he has a stroke of apoplexy will you show me how you run that thing
You bet I will the redsweatered one promised her cheerfully
How much longer will it be before this bench is in the shade
she asked him next
Half an hourmaybe a little longer
Pete glanced again anxiously upward
Andhow long do these spasms usually last
Jeans head tilted toward Robert Grant Burns as impersonally as if she were indicating a horse with colic
But the camera man had gone as far as was wise if he cared to continue working for Burns and he made no reply whatever
So Jean turned her attention to the man whose bulk shaded her from the sun and whose remarks would have been wholly unforgivable had she not chosen to ignore them
If you really are anxious to go on making pictures why dont you stop all that ranting and be sensible about it
she asked him
You cant bully me into being afraid of you you know
And really you are making an awful spectacle of yourself going on like that
Listen here
Are you going to get off that bench and out of the scene
By a tremendous effort Robert Grant Burns spoke that sentence with a husky kind of calm
That all depends upon yourself Mr Burns
First I want to know by what right you come here with your picturemaking
You havent explained that yet you know
The highest paid director of the Great Western Film Company looked at her long
With her head tilted back Jean returned the look
Oh all rightall right he surrendered finally
Read that paper
That ought to satisfy you that we aint trespassing here or anywhere else
And if youd kindlyand Mr Burns emphasized the word kindlyremove yourself to some other spot that is just as comfortable Jean did not even hear him once she had the paper in her hands and had begun to read it
So Robert Grant Burns folded his arms across his heaving chest and watched her and studied her and measured her with his mind while she read
He saw the pulling together of her eyebrows and the pinching of her under lip between her teeth
He saw how she unconsciously sheltered the little brown bird under her left hand in her lap because she must hold the paper with the other and he quite forgot his anger against her
Sitting so she made a picture that appealed to him
Had you asked him why he would have said that she was the type that would photograph well and that she had a screen personality which would have been high praise indeed coming from him
Jean read the brief statement that in consideration of a certain sum paid to him that day by Robert G Burns her uncle Carl Douglas thereby gave the said Robert G Burns permission to use the Lazy A ranch and anything upon it or in any manner pertaining to it for the purpose of making motion pictures
It was plainly set forth that Robert G Burns should be held responsible for any destruction of or damage to the property and that he might for the sum named use any cattle bearing the Lazy A or Bar O brands for the making of pictures so long as he did them no injury and returned them in good condition to the range from which he had gathered them
Jean recognized her uncles ostentatious attempt at legal phraseology and knew even without the evidence of his angular writing that the document was genuine
She knew also that Robert Grant Burns was justified in ordering her off that bench she had no right there where he was making his pictures
She forced back the bitterness that filled her because of her own helplessness and folded the paper carefully
The little brown bird chirped shrilly and fluttered a feeble protest when she took away her sheltering hand
Jean returned the paper hastily to its owner and took up the bird
I beg your pardon for delaying your work she said coldly and rose from the bench
But you might have explained your presence in the first place
She wrapped the bird carefully in her handkerchief so that only its beak and its bright eyes were uncovered pulled her hat forward upon her head and walked away from them down the path to the stables
Robert Grant Burns turned slowly on his heels and watched her go and until she had led out her horse mounted and ridden away he said never a word
Pete Lowry leaned an elbow upon the camera and watched her also until she passed out of sight around the corner of the dilapidated calf shed and he was as silent as the director
Some rider Lee Milligan commented to the assistant camera man and without any tangible reason regretted that he had spoken
Robert Grant Burns turned harshly to the two women
Now then you two go through that scene again
And when you put out your hand to stop Muriel dont grab at her Mrs
Gay
Hesitate
You want your son to get the warning but youve got your doubts about letting her take the risk of going
And Gay when you read the letter try and show a little emotion in your face
You saw how that girl looked see if you cant get that hurt bitter look GRADUALLY as you read
The way she got it
Put in more feeling and not so much motion
You know what I mean you saw the girl
Thats the stuff that gets over
Ready
Camera
CHAPTER IX A MANSIZED JOB FOR JEAN Jean was just returning wetlashed from burying the little brown bird under a wildrose bush near the creek
She had known all along that it would die everything that she took any interest in turned out badly it seemed to her
The wonder was that the bird had lived so long after she had taken it under her protection
All that day her Aunt Ella had worn a wet towel turbanwise upon her head and the look of a martyr about to enter a den of lions
Add that to the habitual atmosphere of injury which she wore and Aunt Ella was not what one might call a cheerful companion
Besides the appearance of the wet towel was a danger signal to Jeans conscience and forbade any thought of saddling Pard and riding away from the Bar Nothing into her own dream world and the great outdoors
Jeans conscience commanded her instead to hang her ridingclothes in the closet and wear striped percale and a gingham apron which she hated and to sweep and dust and remember not to whistle and to look sympatheticwhich she was not particularly and to ask her Aunt Ella frequently if she felt any better and if there was anything Jean could do for her
There never was anything she could do but conscience and custom required her to observe the ceremony of asking
Aunt Ella found some languid satisfaction in replying dolorously that there was nothing that anybody could do and that her part in life seemed to be to suffer
You may judge what Jeans mood was that day when you are told that she came to the point not an hour before the bird died of looking at her aunt with that little smile at the corners of her eyes and just easing her lips
Well you certainly play your part in life with a heap of enthusiasm she had replied and had gone out into the kitchen and whistled when she did not feel in the least like whistling
Her conscience knew Jean pretty well and did not attempt to reprove her for what she had done
Then she found the bird dead in the little nest she had made for it and things went all wrong
She was returning from the burial of the bird and was trying to force herself back to her normal attitude of philosophic calm when she saw her Uncle Carl sitting on the edge of the front porch with his elbows resting loosely upon his knees his head bowed and his bootheel digging a rude trench in the hardpacked earth
The sight of him incensed her suddenly
Once more she wished that she might get at his brain and squeeze out his thoughts and it never occurred to her that she would probably have found them extremely commonplace thoughts that strayed no farther than his own little personal business of life and that they would easily be translated to the dollar sign
His attitude was one of gloomy meditation and her own mood supplied the subject
She watched him for a minute or two and his abstraction was so deep that he did not feel her presence
Uncle Carl just how much did the Lazy A cost you
she asked so abruptly that she herself was surprised at the question
Or putting it another way just how many dollars and cents did you spend in defending dad
Carl started which was perfectly natural and glared at her which was natural also when one considers that Jean had without warning opened a subject tacitly forbidden upon that ranch
His eyes hardened a little while he looked at her for between these two there was scant affection
What do you want to know for
he countered when she persisted in looking at him as though she was waiting for an answer
Because Ive a right to know
Some time within four yearsI mean to buy back the Lazy A I want to know how much it will take
Until that moment Jean had merely dreamed of some day buying it back
Until she spoke she would have named the idea a beautiful impossible desire
Where you going to get the money
Carl looked at her curiously as if he almost doubted her sanity
Rob a bank perhaps
How much will it take to square things with you
Of course being a relative I expect to be cheated a little
So I am going to adopt sly sleuthlike methods and find out just how much dad owed you beforeit happened and just how much the lawyers charged and what was the real market value of the outfit and all that
Dad told me dad told me that there was something left over for me
He didnt explainthere wasnt time and I couldnt listen to dollartalk then
Ive gone along all this time just drifting and getting used to facts and taking it for granted that everything is all right Well whats wrong
Everything is all right far as I know
I can see what youre driving at And Im a pretty fair driver too Jean cut in calmly
Ill reach my destination I thinkgive me time enough
Whatever fool notion youve got in your head youd better drop it Carl told her harshly
There aint anything you can do to better matters
I came out with the worst of it when you come right down to facts and all the nagging Jean went toward him as if she would strike him with her uplifted hand
Dont dare say that
How can you say thatand think of dad
He got the worst of it
Hes the one that suffers mostand hes as innocent as you or I
You know it
Carl rose from the porch and faced her like an enemy
What do you mean by that
I know it
If I knew anything like that do you think Id leave a stone unturned to prove it
Do you think I think we both know dad
And some things were not provedto my satisfaction at least
And you know how long the jury was out and what a time they had agreeing
Some points were weak
It was simply that they couldnt point to any one else
You know that was it
If I could find Art Osgood Whats he got to do with it
Her uncle leaned a little and peered into her face which the dusk was veiling
That is what I want to find out
Jeans voice was quiet but it had a quality which he had never before noticed
Youd better he advised her tritely let sleeping dogs lie
Thats the trouble with sleeping dogs they do lie more often than not
These particular dogs have lied for nearly three years
Im going to stir them up and see if I cant get a yelp of the truth out of them
Oh you are
Carl laughed ironically
Youll stir up a lot of unpleasantness for yourself and the rest of us is what youll do
The things over and done with
Folks are beginning to forget it
Youve got a home Jean laughed and her laugh was extremely unpleasant
You get as good as the rest of us get her uncle reminded her sharply
I came near going broke myself over the affair if you want to know and you stand there and accuse me of cheating you out of something
I dont know what in heavens name you expect
The Lazy A didnt make me rich I can tell you that
It just barely helped to tide things over
Youve got a home here and you can come and go as you please
What you aint got he added bitterly is common gratitude
He turned away from her and went into the house and Jean sat down upon the edge of the porch and stared away at the dimming outline of the hills and wondered what had come over her
Three years on this ranch seeing her uncle every day almost living under the same roof with him talking with him upon the everyday business of lifeand to night for the first time the forbidden subject had been opened
She had said things that until lately she had not realized were in her mind
She had never liked her uncle who was so different from her father but she had never accused him in her mind of unfairness until she had written something of the sort in her ledger
She had never thought of quarrellingand yet one could scarcely call this encounter less than a quarrel
And the strange part of it was that she still believed what she had said she still intended to do the things she declared she would do
Just how she would do them she did not know but her purpose was hardening and coming cleancut out of the vague background of her mind
After awhile the dim outline of the highshouldered hills glowed under a yellowing patch of light
Jean sat with her chin in her palms and watched the glow brighten swiftly
Then some unseen force seemed to be pushing a bright yellow disk up through a gap in the hills and the gap was almost too narrow so that the disk touched either side as it slid slowly upward
At last it was up launched fairly upon its leisurely drifting journey across to the farther hills behind her
It was not quite round
That was because one edge had scraped too hard against the side of the hill perhaps
But warped though it was its light fell softly upon Jeans face and showed it set and still and sterneyed and somber
She sat there awhile longer until the slopes lay softly revealed to her their hollows filled with inky shadows
She drew a long breath then and looked around her at the familiar details of the Bar Nothing dwellingplace softened a little by the moonlight but harsh with her memories of unhappy days spent there
She rose and went into the house and to her room and changed the hated striped percale for her ridingclothes
A tall lank form detached itself from the black shade of the bunkhouse as she went by hesitated perceptibly and then followed her down to the corral
When she had gone in with a rope and later led out Pard the form stood forth in the white light of the moon
Where are you going Jean
Lite asked her in a tone that was soothing in its friendliness
That you Lite
Im goingwell just going
Ive got to ride
She pulled Pards bridle off the peg where she always hung it and laid an arm over his neck while she held the bit against his clinched teeth
Pard never did take kindly to the feel of the cold steel in his mouth and she spoke to him sharply before his jaws slackened
Want me to go along with you
Lite asked and reached for his saddle and blanket
No I want you to go to bed
Jeans tone was softer than it had been for that whole day
Youve had all the riding you need
Ive been shut up with Aunt Ella and her favorite form of torture
Got your gun
Lite gave the latigo a final pull which made Pard grunt
Of course
Why
Nothingonly its a good night for coyotes and you might get a shot at one
Another thing a guns no good on earth when you havent got it with you
Yes and youve told me so about once a week ever since I was big enough to pull a trigger Jean retorted with something approaching her natural tone
Maybe I wont come back Lite
Maybe Ill camp over home till morning
Lite did not say anything in reply to that
He leaned his long person against a corral post and watched her out of sight on the trail up the hill
Then he caught his own horse saddled it leisurely and rode away
Jean rode slowly leaving the trail and striking out across the open country straight for the Lazy A
She had no direct purpose in riding this way she had not intended to ride to the Lazy A until she named the place to Lite as her destination but since she had told him so she knew that was where she was going
The picturepeople would not be there at night and she felt the need of coming as close as possible to her father at the Lazy A where his thoughts would cling she felt near to himmuch nearer than when she was at the Bar Nothing
And that the gruesome memory of what had happened there did not make the place seem utterly horrible merely proves how unshakable was her faith in him
A coyote trotted up out of a hollow facing her stiffened with astonishment dropped nose and tail and slid away in the shadow of the hill
A couple of minutes later Jean saw him sitting alert upon his haunches on a moonbathed slope watching to see what she would do
She did nothing and the coyote pointed his nose to the moon yapyapyapped a quavering defiance and slunk out of sight over the hill crest
Her mind now was more at ease than it had been since the day of horror when she had first stared black tragedy in the face
She was passing through that phase of calm elation which follows close upon the heels of a great resolve
She had not yet come to the actual surmounting of the obstacles that would squeeze hope from the heart of her she had not yet looked upon the possibility of absolute failure
She was going to buy back the Lazy A from her Uncle Carl and she was going to tear away that atmosphere of emptiness and desolation which it had worn so long
She was going to prove to all men that her father never had killed Johnny Croft
She was going to do it
Then life would begin where it had left off three years ago
And when this deadening load of trouble was lifted then perhaps she could do some of the glorious great things she had all of her life dreamed of doing
Or if she never did the glorious great things she would at least have done something to justify her existence
She would be content in her cage if she could go round and round doing things for dad
A level stretch of country lay at the foot of the long bluff which farther along held the Lazy A coulee close against its rocky side
The high ridges stood out boldly in the moonlight so that she could see every rock and the shadow that it cast upon the ground
Little soothing night noises fitted themselves into her thoughts and changed them to waking dreams
Crickets that hushed while she passed them by the faint hissing of a half wakened breeze that straightway slept upon the grasses it had stirred the sleepy protest of some bird which Pards footsteps had startled
She came into Lazy A coulee half fancying that it was a real homecoming
But when she reached the gate and found it lying flat upon the ground away from the broad tread of the picturepeoples machine her mind jarred from dreams back to reality
From sheer habit she dismounted picked up the spineless thing of stakes and barbed wire dragged it into place across the trail and fastened it securely to the post
She remounted and went on and a little of the hopefulness was gone from her face
Ill just about have to rob a bank I guess she told herself with a grim humor at the tremendous undertaking to which she had so calmly committed herself
This is what dad would call a mansized job I reckon
She pulled up in the whitelighted trail and stared along the empty saggingroofed sheds and stables and at the corral with its open gate and warped rails and leaning posts
Ill just about have to rob a bankor write a book that will make me famous
She touched Pard with a rein end and went on slowly
Robbing a bank would be the quickest and easiest she decided whimsically as she neared the place where she always sheltered Pard
But not so ladylike
I guess Ill write a book
It should be something real thrilly so the people will rush madly to all the bookstores to buy it
It should have a beautiful girl and at least two handsome menone with all the human virtues and the other with all the arts of the devil and the cruel strength of the savage
AndI think some Indians and outlaws would add several dollars worth of thrills or else a ghost and a haunted house
I wonder which would sell the best
Indians could steal the girl and give her two handsome men a chance to do chapters of stunts and the wicked one could find her first and carry her away in front of him on a horse they do those things in books
and the hero could follow in a mad chase for miles and miles But then ghosts can be made very creepy with tantalizing glimpses of them now and then in about every other chapter and mysterious hints here and there and characters coming down to breakfast with white drawn faces and haggard eyes
And the wicked one would look over his shoulder and then utter a sardonic laugh
Sardonic is such an effective word I dont believe Indians would give him any excuse for sardonic laughter
She swung down from the saddle and led Pard into his stall that was very black next the manger and very light where the moon shone in at the door
I must have lots of moonlight and several stormy sunsets and the wind soughing in the branches
I shall have to buy a new dictionarya big fat heavy one with the flags of all nations and how to measure the contents of an empty hogshead and the deaf and dumb alphabet and everything but the word you want to know the meaning of and whether it begins with ph or an f She took the saddle off Pard and hung it up by a stirrup on the rusty spike where she kept it with the bridle hung over the stirrup and the saddle blanket folded over the horn
She groped in the manger and decided that there was hay enough to last him till morning and went out and closed the door
Her shadow fell clean cut upon the rough planks and she stood for a minute looking at it as if it were a person
Her Stetson hat tilted a little to one side her hair fluffed loosely at the sides leaving her neck daintily slender where it showed above the turnedback collar of her gray sweater her shoulders square and capable and yet not too heavy and the slim contour of her figure reaching down to the ground
She studied it abstractedly as she would study herself in her mirror conscious of the individuality its likeness to herself
I dont know what kind of a mess youll make of it she said to her shadow but youre going to tackle it just the same
You cant do a thing till you get some money
She turned then and went thoughtfully up to the house and into her room which had as yet been left undisturbed behind the bars she had placed against idle invasion
The moon shone full into the window that faced the coulee and she sat down in the old black wooden rocker and gazed out upon the familiar open stretch of sand and scant grassgrowth that lay between the house and the corrals
She turned her eyes to the familiar bold outline of the bluff that swung round in a crude oval to the point where the trail turned into the coulee from the southwest
Halfway between the base and the ragged skyline the boulder that looked like an elephants head stood out white of profile hooded with black shade
Beyond was the fat shelf of ledge that had a small cave beneath where she had once found a nest full of little hungry birds and upon the slope beneath the telltale scattered wingfeathers to show what fate had fallen upon the mother
Those birds had died also and she had wept and given them Christian burial and had afterwards spent hours every day with her little rifle hunting the destroyer of that small home
She remembered the incident now as a small thread in the memorypattern she was weaving
While the shadows shortened as the moon swung high she sat and looked out upon the coulee and the bluff that sheltered it and she saw the things that were blended cunningly with the things that were not
After a long while her hands unclasped themselves from behind her head and dropped numbly to her lap
She sighed and moved stiffly and knew that she was tired and that she must get some sleep because she could not sit down in one spot and think her way through the problems she had taken it upon herself to solve
So she got up and crept under the Navajo blanket upon the couch tucked it close about her shoulders and shut her eyes deliberately
Presently she fell asleep
CHAPTER X JEAN LEARNS WHAT FEAR IS LIKE Sometime in the still part of the night which comes after midnight Jean woke slowly from dreaming of the old days that had been so vivid in her mind when she went to sleep
Just at first she did not know what it was that awakened her though her eyes were open and fixed upon the lighted square of the window
She knew that she was in her room at the Lazy A but just at first it seemed to her that she was there because she had always been sleeping in that room
She sighed and turned her face away from the moonlight and closed her eyes again contentedly
Half dreaming she opened them again and stared up at the low ceiling
Somewhere in the house she heard footsteps
Very slowly she wakened enough to listen
They were footstepsthe heavy measured tread of some man
They were in the room that had been her fathers bedroom and at first they seemed perfectly natural and right they seemed to be her dads footsteps and she wondered mildly what he was doing up at that time of night
The footsteps passed from there into the kitchen and stopped in the corner where stood the oldfashioned cupboard with perforated tin panels in the doors and at the sides and the little drawers at the topthe kind that old people call a safe
She heard a drawer pulled out
Without giving any conscious thought to it she knew which drawer it was it was the one next the wall the one that did not pull out straight and so had to be jerked out
What was her dad 



Jean thrilled then with a tremor of fear
She had wakened fully enough to remember
That was not her dad out there in the kitchen
She did not know who it was it was some strange man prowling through the house hunting for something
She felt again the tremor of fear that is the heritage of womanhood alone in the dark
She pulled the Navajo blanket up to her ears with the instinct of the woman to hide because she is not strong enough to face and fight the danger that comes in the dark
She listened to the sound of that drawer being pushed back and the other drawer being pulled out and she shivered under the blanket
Then she reached out her hand and got hold of her sixshooter which she had laid down unthinkingly upon a chair near the couch
She wondered if she had locked the outside door when she came in
She could not remember having done so probably she had not since it is not the habit of honest ranchdwellers to lock their doors at night
She wanted to get up and see and fasten it somehow but she was afraid the man out there might hear her
As it was she reasoned nervously with herself he probably did not suspect that there was any one in the house
It was an empty house
And unless he had seen Pard in the closed stall



She wondered if he had heard Pard there and had investigated and found him
She wondered if he would come into this room
She remembered how securely she had nailed up the door from the kitchen and she breathed freer
She remembered also that she had her gun there under her hand
She closed her trembling fingers on the familiar grip of it and the feel of it comforted her and steadied her
Yet she had no desire no slightest impulse to get up and see who was there
She was careful not to move except to cover the doorway to the kitchen with her gun
After a few minutes the man came and tried the door and Jean lifted herself cautiously upon her elbow and waited in grim desperation
If he forced that door open if he came in she certainly would shoot and if she shotwell you remember the fate of that hawk on the wing
The man did not force the door open which was perhaps the luckiest thing that ever happened to him
He fussed there until he must have made sure that it was fastened firmly upon the inside and then he left it and went into what had been the livingroom
Jean did not move from her halfsitting position nor did she change the aim of her gun
He might come back and try again
She heard him moving about in the livingroom
Surely he did not expect to find money in an empty house or anything else of any commercial value
What was he after
Finally he came back to the kitchen crossed it and stood before the barred door
He pushed against it tentatively then stood still for a minute and finally went out
Jean heard him step upon the porch and pull the kitchen door shut behind him
She knew that squeal of the bottom hinge and she knew the final gasp and click that proved the latch was fastened
She heard him step off the porch to the path she heard the soft crunch of his feet in the sandy gravel as he went away toward the stable
Very cautiously she got off the couch and crept to the window and with her gun gripped tight in her hand she looked out
But he had moved into a deep shadow of the bluff and she could see nothing of him save the deeper shadow of his swiftmoving body as he went down to the corral
Jean gave a long sigh of nervous relaxation and crept shivering under the Navajo blanket
The gun she slid under the pillow and her fingers rested still upon the cool comfort of the butt
Soon she heard a horse galloping and she went to the window again and looked out
The moon hung low over the bluff so that the trail lay mostly in the shadow
But down by the gate it swung out in a wide curve to the rocky knoll and there it lay moonlighted and empty
She fixed her eyes upon that curve and waited
In a moment the horseman galloped out upon the curve rounded it and disappeared in the shadows beyond
At that distance and in that deceptive light she could not tell who it was but it was a horseman a man riding at night in haste and with some purpose in mind
Jean had thought that the prowler might be some tramp who had wandered far off the beaten path of migratory humans and who stumbling upon the coulee and its empty dwellings was searching at random for whatever might be worth carrying off
A horseman did not fit that theory anywhere
That particular horseman had come there deliberately had given the house a deliberate search and had left in haste when he had finished
Whether he had failed or succeeded in finding what he wanted he had left
He had not searched the stables unless he had done that before coming into the house
He had not forced his way into her room probably because he did not want to leave behind him the evidence of his visit which the door would have given or because he feared to disturb the contents of Jeans room
Jean stared up in the dark and puzzled long over the identity of that man and his errand
And the longer she thought about it the more completely she was at sea
All the men that she knew were aware that she kept this room habitable and visited the ranch often
That was no secret it never had been a secret
No one save Lite Avery had ever been in it so far as she knewunless she counted those chance trespassers who had prowled boldly through her most sacred belongings
So that almost any one in the country had he any object in searching the house would know that this room was hers and would act in that knowledge
As to his errand
There could be no errand so far as she knew
There were no missing papers such as plays and novels are accustomed to have cunningly hidden in empty houses
There was no stolen will no hidden treasure no money no Rajahs ruby no ransom of a king these things Jean named over mentally and chuckled at the idea of treasurehunting at the Lazy A
It vas very romantic very mysterious she told herself
And she analyzed the sensation of little wet alligators creeping up her spine that was her own simile and decided that her book should certainly have a ghost in it she was sure that she could describe with extreme vividness the effect of a ghost upon her various characters
In this wise she recovered her composure and laughed at her fear and planned new and thrilly incidents for her novel
She would not tell Lite anything about it she decided
He would try to keep her from coming over here by herself and that would precipitate one of those arguments between them that never seemed to get them anywhere because Lite never would yield gracefully and Jean never would yield at allwhich does not make for peace
She wished just the same that Lite was there
It would be much more comfortable if he were near instead of away over to the Bar Nothing sound asleep in the bunkhouse
As a selfappointed guardian Jean considered Lite something of a nuisance when he wasnt funny
But as a big steadynerved friend and comrade he certainly was a comfort
CHAPTER XI LITES PUPIL DEMONSTRATES Jean awoke to hear the businesslike buzzing of an automobile coming up from the gate
Evidently they were going to make pictures there at the house which did not suit her plans at all
She intended to spend the early morning writing the first few chapters of that book which to her inexperience seemed a simple task and to leave before these people arrived
As it was she was fairly caught
There was no chance of escaping unnoticed unless she slipped out and up the bluff afoot and that would not have helped her in the least since Pard was in the stable
From behind the curtains she watched them for a few minutes
Robert Grant Burns wore a light overcoat which made him look pudgier than ever and he scowled a good deal over some untidylooking papers in his hands and conferred with Pete Lowry in a dissatisfied tone though his words were indistinguishable
Muriel Gay watched the two covertly it seemed to Jean and she also looked dissatisfied over something
Burns and the camera man walked down toward the stables studying the bluff and the immediate surroundings and still talking together
Lee Milligan with his paintshaded eyes and his rouged lips and heavily pencilled eyebrows came up and stood close to Muriel who was sitting now upon the bench near Jeans window
Burns ought to cut out those scenes Gay he began sympathetically
You cant do any more than you did yesterday
And believe me you put it over in good style
I dont see what he wants more than you did
What he wants said Muriel Gay dispiritedly is for me to pull off stunts like that girl
I never saddled a horse in my life till he ordered me to do it in the scene yesterday
Why didnt he tell me far enough ahead so I could rehearse the business
Latigo
It sounds like some Spanish dish with grated cheese on top
I dont believe he knows himself what he meant
Hes getting nutty on Western dope sympathized Lee Milligan
I dont see where this countrys got anything on Griffith Park for atmosphere anyway
What did he want to come away up here in this God forsaken country for
What is there TO it more than he could get within an hours ride of Los Angeles
I should worry about the country said Muriel despondently if somebody would kindly tell me what looping up your latigo means
Burns says that hes got to retake that saddling scene just as soon as the horses get here
It looks just as simple she added spitefully as climbing to the top of the Berry Building tower and doing a leap to a passing airship
In fact Id choose the leap
A warm impulse of helpfulness stirred Jean
She caught up her hat buckled her gun belt around her from pure habit tucked a few loose strands of hair into place and went out where they were
If youll come down to the stable with me she drawled while they were staring their astonishment at her unexpected appearance before them Ill show you how to saddle up
Pards awfully patient about being fussed with you can practice on him
Hes mean about taking the bit though unless you know just how to take hold of him
Come on
The three of themMuriel Gay and her mother and Lee Milliganstared at Jean without speaking
To her it seemed perfectly natural that she should walk up and offer to help the girl to them it seemed not so natural
For a minute the product of the cities and the product of the open country studied each other curiously
Come on urged Jean in her lazily friendly drawl
Its simple enough once you get the hang of it
And she smiled before she added A latigo is just the strap that fastens the cinch
Ill show you
Ill bet Bobby Burns doesnt know that said Muriel Gay and got up from the bench
Its awfully good of you Mr Burns is so I noticed that said Jean while Muriel was waiting for a word that would relieve her feelings without being too blunt
Burns and Pete Lowry and the assistant had gone down the coulee still studying the bluff closely
Ive got to ride down that bluff Muriel informed Jean her eyes following her director gloomily
He asked me last night if I could throw a rope
I dont know what for its an extra punch he wants to put in this picture somewhere
I wish to goodness they wouldnt let him write his own scenarios he just lies awake nights lately thinking up impossible scenes so he can bully us afterwards
Hes simply gone nutty on the subject of punches
Well its easy enough to learn how to saddle a horse Jean told Muriel cheerfully
First you want to put on the bridle Burns told me to put on the saddle first and then he cuts the scene just as I pick up the bridle
The trouble is to get the saddle on right and thenthat latigo dope
But you ought to bridle him first Jean insisted
Supposing you just got the saddle on and your horse got startled and ran off
If you have the bridle on even if you havent the reins you can grab them when he jumps
Well that isnt the way Burns directed the scene yesterday Muriel Gay contended
The scene ends where I pick up the bridle
Then Robert Grant Burns doesnt know
Ive seen men put on the bridle last but its wrong
Lite Avery and everybody who knows Muriel Gay looked at Jean with a weary impatience
What I have to do she stated is what Burns tells me to do
I should worry about its being right or wrong Im not the producer
Jean faced her frowning a little
Then she laughed hung the bridle back on the rusty spike and took down the saddle blanket
Well play Im Robert Grant Burns she said
Ill tell you what to do Lay the blanket on straightits shaped to Pards back so that ought to be easywith the front edge coming forward to his withers thats not right
Maybe I had better do it first and show you
Then youll get the idea
So Jean with the best intention in the world saddled Pard and wondered what there was about so simple a process that need puzzle any one
When she had tightened the cinch and looped up the latigo and explained to Muriel just what she was doing she immediately unsaddled him and laid the saddle down upon its side with the blanket folded once on top and stepped close to the manger
If your saddle isnt hanging up thats the way it should be put on the ground she said
Now you do it
Its easy
It was easy for Jean but Muriel did not find it so simple
Jean went through the whole performance a second time though she was beginning to feel that nature had never fitted her for a teacher of young ladies
Muriel she began to suspect rather resented the process of being taught
In another minute Muriel confirmed the suspicion
I think Ive got it now she said coolly
Thank you ever so much
Robert Grant Burns returned then and close behind him rode Gil Huntley and those other desperados who had helped to brand the calf that other day
Gil was leading a little sorrel with a saddle onMuriels horse evidently
Jean had started back to the house and her own affairs but she lingered with a very human curiosity to see what they were all going to do
She did not know that Robert Grant Burns was perfectly conscious of her presence even when he seemed busiest and was studying her covertly even when he seemed not to notice her at all
Of his company Pete Lowry was the only one who did know it but that was because Pete himself was trained in the art of observation
Pete also knew why Burns was watching Jean and studying her slightest movement and expression and that was why Pete kept smiling that little hidden smile of his while he made ready for the days work and explained to Jean the mechanical part of making movingpictures
Id rather work with live things said Jean after a while
But I can see where this must be rather fascinating too
This is working with live things if anybody wants to know Pete declared
Wait till you see Burns in action handling bronks is easy compared to About where does the side line come Pete
Burns interrupted
If Gil stands here and holds the horse for that closeup saddling He whirled upon Gil Huntley
Lead that sorrel up here he commanded
Well have to cut off his head so the halter wont show
Now hows that
This was growing interesting
Jean backed to a convenient pile of old corral posts and sat down to watch with her chin in her palms and her mind weaving shuttlewise back and forth from one person to another fitting them all into the pattern which made the whole
She watched Robert Grant Burns walking back and forth growling and chuckling by turns as things pleased him or did not please him
She watched Muriel Gay walk to a certain spot which Burns had previously indicated show sudden and uncalledfor fear and haste and go through a pantomime of throwing the saddle on the sorrel
She watched Lee Milligan carry the saddle up and throw it down upon the ground with skirts curled under and stirrups sprawling
Oh dont leave it that way she remonstrated
Lay it on its side
Youll have the skirts kinked so it never will set right
Muriel Gay gasped and looked from her to Robert Grant Burns
For betraying your country and your flag is no crime at all compared with telling your director what he must do
Bring that saddle over here commanded Burns indicating another spot eighteen inches from the first
And dont slop it down like it was a bundle of old clothes
Lay it on its side
How many times have I got to tell you a thing before it soaks into your mind
Not by tone or look or manner did he betray any knowledge that Jean had spoken and Muriel decided that he could not have heard
Lee Milligan moved the saddle and placed it upon its side and Burns went to the camera and eyed the scene critically for its photographic value
He fumbled the script in his hands cocked an eye upward at the sun stepped back and gave a last glance to make sure that nothing could be bettered by altering the detail
Hows Gil outside the line Pete
All right
Now Miss Gay remember youre in a hurry and youre worried half to death
Youve just time enough to get there if you use every second
You were crying when the letterscene closed and this is about five minutes afterwards you just had time enough to catch your horse and lead him out here to saddle him
Register a sob when you turn to pick up the saddle
You ought to do this all right without rehearsing
Get into the scene and start your action at the same time
Pete you pick it up just as she gets to the horses shoulder and starts to turn
Dont forget that sob Gay
Ready
Camera
Jean was absorbed fascinated by this glimpse into a new and very busy little worldthe world of moving picture makers
She leaned forward and watched every moment every little detail
Grab the horn with your right hand Miss Gay
she cried involuntarily when Muriel stooped and started to pick up the saddle
Dontoh it looks as if you were picking up a washboiler
I told you Register that sob
bawled Robert Grant Burns shooting a glance at Jean and stepping from one foot to the other like a fat gobbler in freshfallen snow
Muriel registered that sob and a couple more before she succeeded in heaving the saddle upon the back of the flinching sorrel
Because she took up the saddle by horn and cantle instead of doing it as Jean had taught her she bungled its adjustment upon the horses back
Then the sorrel began to dance away from her and Robert Grant Burns swore under his breath
Stop the camera
he barked and waddled irately up to Muriel
This he observed ironically is drama Miss Gay
We are not making slapstick comedy today and you neednt give an imitation of boosting a barrel over a fence
Tears that were real slipped down over the rouge and grease paint on Muriels cheeks
Why dont you make that girl stop butting in
she flashed unexpectedly
Im not accustomed to working under two directors
She registered another sob which the camera never got
This brought Jean over to where she could lay her hand contritely upon the girls shoulder
Im awfully sorry she drawled with perfect sincerity
I didnt mean to rattle you but you know you never in the world could throw the stirrup over free the way you had hold of the saddle
I thought Burns turned heavily around and looked at Jean as though he had something in his mind to say to her but whatever that something may have been he did not say it
Jean looked at him questioningly and walked back to the pile of posts
I wont butt in any more she called out to Muriel
Only it does look so simple
She rested her elbows on her knees again dropped her chin into her palms and concentrated her mind upon the subject of pictureplays in the making
Muriel recovered her composure stood beside Gil Huntley at the horses head just outside the range of the camera waited for the word of command from Burns and rushed into the saddle scene
Burns shouted Sob
and Muriel sobbed with her face toward the camera
Burns commanded her to pick up the saddle and Muriel picked up the saddle and flung it spitefully upon the back of the sorrel
Oh you forgot the blanket
exclaimed Jean and stopped herself with her hand over her tooimpulsive mouth just as Burns stopped the camera
The director bowed his head and shook it twice slowly and with much meaning
He did not say anything at all no one said anything
Gil Huntley looked at Jean and tried to catch her eye so that he might give her some greeting or at least a glance of understanding
But Jean was wholly concerned with the problem which confronted Muriel
It was a shame she thought to expect a girland when she had reached that far she straightway put the thought into speech as was her habit
Its a shame to expect that girl to do something she doesnt know how to do she said suddenly to Robert Grant Burns
Work at something else why dont you and let me take her somewhere and show her how
Its simple Get up and show her now snapped Burns with some sarcasm and a good deal of exasperation
You seem determined to get into the foreground somehow get up and go through that scene and show us how a girl gets a saddle on a horse
Jean sat still for ten seconds and deliberated while she looked from him to the horse
Again she made a picture that drove its elusive quality of individuality straight to the professional soul of Robert Grant Burns
I will if youll let me do it the right way she said just when he was thinking she would not answer him
She did not wait for his assurance once she had decided to accept the challenge or the invitation she did not quite know which he had meant it to be
Im going to bridle him first though she informed him
And you can tell that star villain to back out of the way
I dont need him
Still Burns did not say anything
He was watching her studying her measuring her seeing her as she would have looked upon the screen
It was his habit to leave people alone until they betrayed their limitations or proved their talent after that if they remained under his direction he drove them as far as their limitations would permit
Jean went first and placed the saddle to her liking upon the ground
You want me to act just as if you were going to take a picture of it dont you
she asked Burns over her shoulder
She was not sure whether he nodded but she acted upon the supposition that he did and took the leadrope from Gils hand
Shall I be hurried and worriedand shall I sob
she asked with the little smile at the corners of her eyes and just easing the line of her lips
Robert Grant Burns seemed to make a quick decision
Sure he said
You saw the action as Miss Gay went through it
Do as she did only well let you have your own ideas of saddling the horse
He turned his head toward Pete and made a very slight gesture and Pete grinned
All ready
Start the action
After that he did not help her by a single suggestion
He tapped Pete upon the shoulder and stood with his feet far apart and his hands on his hips watching her very intently
Jean was plainly startled just at first by the businesslike tone in which he gave the signal
Then she laughed a little
Oh I forgot
I must be hurried and worriedand I must sob she corrected herself
So she hurried and every movement she made counted for something accomplished
She picked up the bridle and shortened her hold upon the lead rope and discovered that the sorrel had a trick of throwing up his head and backing away from the bit
She knew how to deal with that habit however but in her haste she forgot to look as worried as Muriel had looked and so appeared to her audience as being merely determined
She got the bridle on and then she saddled the sorrel
And for good measure she picked up the reins caught the stirrup and went up pivoting the horse upon his hind feet as though she meant to dash madly off into the distance
But she only went a couple of rods before she pulled him up sharply and dismounted
That didnt take me long did it
she asked
I could have hurried a lot more if I had known the horse
Then she stopped dead still and looked at Robert Grant Burns
Oh my goodness I forgot to sob
she gasped
And she caught her hat brim and pulling her Stetson more firmly down upon her head turned and ran up the path to the house and shut herself into her room
CHAPTER XII TO DOUBLE FOR MURIEL GAY While she breakfasted unsatisfactorily upon soda crackers and a bottle of olives which happened to have been left over from a previous luncheon Jean meditated deeply upon the proper beginning of a book
The memory of last night came to her vividly and she smiled while she fished with a pair of scissors for an olive
She would start the book off weirdly with mysterious sounds in an empty room
That she argued should fix firmly the interest of the reader right at the start
By the time she had fished the olive from the bottle however her thoughts swung from the artistic to the material aspect of those mysterious footsteps
What had the man wanted or expected to find
She set down the olive bottle impulsively and went out and around to the kitchen door and opened it
In spite of herself she shuddered as she went in and she walked close to the wall until she was well past the brown stain on the floor
She went to the oldfashioned cupboard and examined the contents of the drawers and looked into a cigarbox which stood open upon the top
She went into her fathers bedroom and looked through everything which did not take long since the room had little left in it
She went into the livingroom also depressingly dusty and forlorn but try as she would to think of some article that might have been left there and was now wanted by some one she could imagine no reason whatever for that nocturnal visit
At the same time there must have been a reason
Men of that country did not ride abroad during the still hours of the night just for the love of riding
Most of them went to bed at dark and slept until dawn
She went out intending to go back to her literary endeavors if she never started that book certainly it would never make her rich and she would never be able to make war upon circumstances
She thought of her father with a twinge of remorse because she had wasted so much time this morning and she scarcely glanced toward the picturepeople down by the corrals so she did not see that Robert Grant Burns turned to look at her and then started hurriedly up the path to the house
Say he called just before she disappeared around the corner
Wait a minute
I want to talk to you
Jean waited and the fat man came up breathing hard because of his haste in the growing heat of the forenoon
Say Id like to use you in a few scenes he began abruptly when he reached her
Gay cant put over the stuff I want and Id like to have you double for her in some riding and roping scenes
Youre about the same size and build and Ill get you a blond wig for closeups like that saddling scene
I believe youve got it in you to make good on the screen anyway the practice youll get doubling for Gay wont do you any harm
Jean looked at him tempted to consent for the fun there would be in it
Id like to she told him after a little silence
I really would love it
But Ive got some work that I must do
Let the work wait urged Burns relieved because she showed no resentment against the proposal
I want to get this picture made
Its going to be a hummer
Theres punch to it or there will be if But you see Jeans drawl slipped across his eager domineering voice I have to earn some money lots of it
Theres something I need it for
Its important
Youll earn money at this he told her bluntly
You didnt think Id ask you to work for nothing I hope
I aint that cheap
Its like this If youll work in this picture and put over what I want itll be feature stuff
Ill pay accordingly
Of course I cant say just how muchthis is just a tryout you understand that
But if you can deliver the goods Ill see that you get treated right
Some producers might play the cheap game just because youre green but I aint that kind and my company aint that kind
Im out after results
Involuntarily his eyes turned toward the bluff
Theres a ride down the bluff that I want and a ropingsay can you throw a rope
Jean laughed
Lite Avery says I can she told him and Lite Avery can almost write his name in the air with a rope
If you can make that dash down the bluff and do the roping I want whyLord
Youll have to be working a gold mine to beat what Id be willing to pay for the stuff
Theres no place here in the coulee where you can ride down the bluff Jean informed him except back of the house and thats out of sight
Farther over theres a kind of trail that a good horse can handle
I came down it on a run once with Pard
A man was drowning over here in the creek and I was up on the bluff and happened to see him and his horse turn over it was during the high water
So I made a run down off the point and got to him in time to rope him out
You might use that trail
Robert Grant Burns stood and stared at her as though he did not see her at all
In truth he was seeing with his professional eyes a picture of that dash down the bluff
He was seeing a closeup of Jean whirling her loop and lassoing the drowning man just as he had given up hope and was going under for the third time
Lee Milligan was the drowning man
and the agony of his eyes and the tenseness of Jeans face made Robert Grant Burns draw a long breath
Lord what featurestuff that would make
he said under his breath
Ill write a scenario around that rescue scene
Whereupon he caught himself
It is not well for a director to permit his enthusiasm to carry him into injudicious speech
He chuckled to hide his eagerness
Well you can show me that location he said and well get to work
Youll have to use the sorrel of course but I guess hell be all right
This saddling scene will have to wait till I send for a wig
You can change clothes with Miss Gay and get by all right at a distance just as you are
A little makeup maybe shell fix that
Come on lets get to work
And dont worry about the salary Ill tell you tonight what itll be after I see you work
When he was in that mood Robert Grant Burns swept everything before him
He swept Jean into his plans before she had really made up her mind whether to accept his offer or stick to her literary efforts
He had Muriel Gay up at the house and preparing to change clothes with Jean and he had Lee Milligan started for town in the machine with the key to Burns emergency wardrobe trunk before Jean realized that she was actually going to do things for the camera to make into a picture
Im glad you are going to double in that ride down the bluff anyway Muriel declared while she blacked Jeans brows and put shadows around her eyes
I could have done it of course but mamma is so nervous about my getting hurt that I hate to do anything risky like that
It upsets her for days
There isnt much risk in riding down the bluff said Jean carelessly
Not if youve got a good horse
I wonder if that sorrel is rope broke
Have you ever roped off him
No said Muriel I havent
She might have added that she never roped off any horse but she did not
Ill have to try him out and see what hes like before I try to rope for a picture
I wonder if therell be time now
Jean was pleasantly excited over this new turn of events
She had dreamed of doing many things but never of helping to make moving pictures
She was eager and full of curiosity like a child invited to play a new and fascinating game and she kept wondering what Lite would have to say about her posing for moving pictures
Try to stop her probablyand fail as usual
When she went out to where the others were grouped in the shade she gave no sign of any inner excitement or perturbation
She went straight up to Burns and waited for his verdict
Do I look like Miss Gay
she drawled
The keen eyes of Burns half closed while he studied her
No I cant say that you do he said after a moment
Walk off toward the corralsand say
Mount the sorrel and start off like you were in a deuce of a hurry
Thatll be one scene and Id like to see how you do it when you can have your own way about it and how close up we can make it and have you pass for Gay
How far shall I ride
Jeans eyes had a betraying light of interest
Ohto the gate maybe
Can you get a long shot down the trail to the gate Pete and keep skyline in the scene
Pete moved the camera fussed and squinted and then nodded his head
Sure I can
But youll have to make it right away or else wait till tomorrow
The suns getting around pretty well in front
Well take it right after this rehearsal if the girl can put the stuff over right Burns muttered
And she can or Im badly mistaken
Pete that girls He stopped short because the shadow of Lee Milligan was moving up to them
All right Misssay whats your name anyway
He was told and went on briskly
Miss Douglas just start from off that wayabout where that round rock is
Youll come into the scene a little beyond
Hurry straight up to the sorrel and mount and ride off
Your lover is going to be trapped by the bandits and youve just heard it and are hurrying to save him
Get the idea
Now lets see you do it
You dont want me to sob do you
Jean looked over her shoulder to inquire
Because if I were going to save my lover I dont believe Id want to waste time weeping around all over the place
Burns chuckled
You can cut out the sob he permitted
Just go ahead like it was real stuff
Jean was standing by the rock ready to start
She looked at Burns speculatively
Oh well if it were real Id run
Go ahead and run then
Burns commanded
Run she did and startled the sorrel so that it took quick work to catch him
Camera
She might not do it like that again ever
cried Burns
She was up in the saddle and gone in a flurry of dusts while Robert Grant Burns stood with his hands on his hips and watched her gloatingly
Lord
But that girls a find
he ejaculated and this time he did not seem to care who heard him
He cut the scene just as Jean pulled up at the gate
See how she set that sorrel down on his haunches
he chuckled to Pete
Talk about featurestuff that girl will jump our releases up ten per cent Pete with the punches I can put into Gays parts now
How many feet was that scene twentyfive
Fifteen corrected Pete
And every foot with a punch in it
Too bad shes got to double for Gay
Shes got the face for closeup work believe me
To this tentative remark Robert Grant Burns made no reply whatever
He went off down the path to meet Jean critically watching her approach to see how nearly she resembled Muriel Gay and how close she could come to the camera without having the substitution betrayed upon the screen
Muriel Gay was a leading woman with a certain assured following among movie audiences
Daring horsewomanship would greatly increase that following and therefore the financial returns of these Western pictures
Burns was her director and it was to his interest to build up her popularity
Since the idea first occurred to him therefore of using Jean as a substitute for Muriel in all the scenes that required nerve and skill in riding he looked upon her as a double for Muriel rather than from the viewpoint of her own individual possibilities on the screen
I dont know about your hair he told her when she came up to him and stopped
Well run the negative tonight and see how it shows up
The rest of the scene was all right
I had Pete make it
Im going to take some scenes down here by the gate now with the boys
I wont need you till after lunch probably then Ill have you make that ride down off the bluff and some closeup rope work
I suppose I ought to ride over to the ranch Jean said undecidedly
And I ought to try out this sorrel if you want me to use him
Would some other day do just In the picture business interrupted Robert Grant Burns dictatorially the workinghours of an actor belong to the director hes working for
If I use you in pictures your time will belong to me on the days when I use you
Ill expect you to be on hand when I want you get that
My time said Jean resolutely will belong to you if I consider it worth my while to let you have it
Otherwise it will belong to me
Burns chuckled
Well we might as well get down to brass tacks and have things thoroughly understood he decided
Ill use you as an extra to double for Miss Gay where theres any riding stunts and so on
Miss Gay is a good actress but she cant ride to amount to anything
With the clothes and makeup you impersonate her
See what I mean
And for straight riding Ill pay you five dollars a day five dollars for your time on the days that I want to use you
For any feature stuff like that ride down the bluff and the roping and the like of that itll be more
Twenty five dollars for featurestuff say and five dollars for straight riding
Get me
I do yes
Jeans drawl gave no hint of her inner elation at the prospect of earning so much money so easily
What she wondered would Lite say to that
Well that parts all right then
By featurestuff I mean anything I want you to do to put a punch in the story anything from riding bucking horses and shootingsay can you shoot
Yes I think so
Well Ill have use for that too later on
The more stunts you can pull off the bigger hits these pictures are going to make
You see that of course
And what Ive offered you is a pretty good rate but I expect to get results
I told you I wasnt any cheap John to work for
Now get this point and get it right Ill expect you to report to me every morning here at eight oclock
I may need you that day and I may not but youre to be on hand
If I do need you you get paid for that day whether its one scene or twenty youre to work in
If I dont need you that day you dont get anything
Thats what being an extra means
You start in today and if you make the ride down the bluff itll be twentyfive today
But you cant go riding off somewhere else and maybe not be here when I want you
Youre under my orders like the rest of the company
Get that
Ill try it for a week anyway she said
Obeying your orders will be the hardest part of it Mr Burns
I always want to stamp my foot and say I wont when any one tells me I must do something
She laughed infectiously
Youll probably fire me before the weeks out she prophesied
Ill be as meek as possible but if we quarrelwell you know how sweettempered I can be
Burns looked at her queerly and laughed
Ill take a chance on that he said and went chuckling back to the camera
To have a girl absolutely ignore his position and authority and treat him in that offhand manner of equality was a new experience to Robert Grant Burns terror among photoplayers
Jean went over to where Muriel and her mother were sitting in the shade and asked Muriel if she would like to ride Pard out into the flat beyond the corrals where she meant to try out the sorrel
Id like to use you anyway she added frankly to practice on
You can ride past you know and let me rope you
Oh it wont hurt you and therell be no risk at all she hastened to assure the other when she saw refusal in Muriels eyes
Ill not take any turns around the horn you know
I dont want Muriel taking risks like that put in Mrs
Gay hastily
Thats just why Burns is going to have you double for her
A leading woman cant afford to get hurt
Muriel you stay here and rest while you have a chance
Goodness knows its hard enough at best to work under Burns
Jean looked at her and turned away
So that was it a leading woman could not afford to be hurt
Some one else who didnt amount to anything must take the risks
She had received her first little lesson in this new business
She went straight to Burns interrupted him in coaching his chief villain for a scene and asked him if he could spare a man for half an hour or so
I want some one to throw a rope over on the run she explained naively to try out this sorrel
Burns regarded her somberly he hated to be interrupted in his work
Aint there anybody else you can rope
he wanted to know
Wheres Gay
A leading woman quoted Jean serenely cant afford to get hurt
Burns chuckled
He knew who was the author of that sentence he had heard it before
Well if youre as fatal as all that I cant turn over my leading man for you to practice on either he pointed out to her
Whats the matter with a calf or something
You wont let me ride out of your sight to round one up Jean retorted
There are no calves handy thats why I asked for a man
Whereupon the villains looked at one another queerly and the chuckle of their director exploded into a full lunged laugh
Im going to use all these fellows in a couple of scenes he told her
Cant you practice on a post
I dont have to practice
Its the sorrel I want to try out
Jeans voice lost a little of its habitual soft drawl
Really these picturepeople did seem very dense upon some subjects
Well now look here
Robert Grant Burns caught at the shreds of his domineering manner
My part of this business is producing the scenes
Youll have to attend to the gettingready part
Youyou wouldnt expect me to help you put on your makeup would you
No now that I recognize your limitations I shall not ask any help which none of you are able or have the nerve to give she returned coolly
I wish I had Lite here but I guess Pard and I can handle the sorrel ourselves
Sorry to have disturbed you
Robert Grant Burns his leading man and all his villains stood and watched her walk away from them to the stable
They watched her lead Pard out and turn him loose in the biggest corral
When they saw her take her coiled rope mount the sorrel and ride in they went in a hurried group to where they might look into that corral
They watched her pull the gate shut after her lean from the saddle and fasten the chain hook in its accustomed link
By the time she had widened her loop and turned to charge down upon unsuspecting Pard Robert Grant Burns his leading man and all his villains were lined up along the widest space between the corral rails and Pete Lowry was running over so as to miss none of the show
Oh I thought you were all so terribly busy
taunted Jean while her loop was circling over her head
Pard wheeled just then upon his hind feet but the loop settled true over his head and drew tight against his shoulders
The sorrel lunged and fought the rope and snorted and reared
It took fully two minutes for Jean to force him close enough to Pard so that she might flip off the loop
Pard himself caught the excitement and snorted and galloped wildly round and round the enclosure but Jean did not mind that what brought her lips so tightly together was the performance of the sorrel
While she was coiling her rope he was making halfhearted buck jumps across the corral
When she swished the rope through the air to widen her loop he reared and whirled
She jabbed him smartly with the spurs and he kicked forward at her feet
Say she drawled to Burns I dont know what sort of a picture youre going to make but if you want any roping done from this horse youll have to furnish meals and beds for your audiences
With that she was off across the corral at a tearing pace that made the watchers gasp
The sorrel swung clear of the fence
He came near going down in a heap but recovered himself after scrambling along on his knees
Jean brought him to a stand before Burns
Ill have to ask you to raise your price Mr Burns if you want me to run this animal down the bluff she stated firmly
Hes just what I thought he was all along a ridearoundtheblock horse from some livery stable
When it comes to range work he doesnt know as much as Some people
I get you Burns cut in drily
How about that horse of yours
Would you be willing to let me have the use of himat so much per
If I do the riding yes
Now since youre here and dont seem as busy as you thought you were Ill show you the difference between this liverystable beast and a real ropehorse
She dismounted and called to Pard and Pard came to her stepping warily because of the sorrel and the rope
Just to save time will one of you boys go and bring my riding outfit from the stable
she asked the line at the fence whereupon the leading man and all the villains started unanimously to perform that slight service which shows pretty well how Jean stood in their estimation
Now thats a real typical liverystable saddle and bridle she observed to Burns pointing scornfully at the sorrel
I was going to tell you that Id hate to be seen in a picture riding that outfit anyway
Now you watch how differently Pard behaves with a rope and everything
And you watch the sorrel get whats coming to him
Shall I bust him
You mean throw him
Burns in his eagerness began to climb the corral fenceuntil he heard a rail crack under his weight
Yes BUST him if you want to
John Jimpson
if you can rope and throw that sorrel Jean did not reply to that halffinished sentence
She was busy saddling Pard now she mounted and widened her loop with a sureness of the result that flashed a thrill of expectation to her audience
Twice the loop circled over her head before she flipped it out straight and true toward the frantic sorrel as he surged by
She caught him fairly by both front feet and swung Pard half away from him
Pards muscles stiffened against the jerk of the rope and the sorrel went down with a bump
Pard backed knowingly and braced himself like the trained ropehorse he was and Jean looked at Robert Grant Burns and laughed
I didnt bust him she disclaimed whimsically
He done busted himself
She touched Pard with her heel and rode up so that the rope slackened and she could throw off the loop
Did you see how Pard set himself
she questioned eagerly
I could have gotten off and gone clear away and Pard would have kept that horse from getting on his feet
Now you see the difference dont you
Pard never would have gone down like that
Oh youll do chuckled Robert Grant Burns Ill pay you a little more and use you and your horse together
Call that settled
Come on boys lets get to work
CHAPTER XIII PICTURES AND PLANS AND MYSTERIOUS FOOTSTEPS When Lite objected to her staying altogether at the Lazy A Jean assured him that she was being terribly practical and cautious and businesslike and pointed out to him that staying there would save Pard and herself the trip back and forth each day and would give her time mornings and evenings to work on her book
Lite of course knew all about that soontobefamous book
He usually did know nearly everything that concerned Jean or held her interest
Whether after three years of futile attempts Lite still felt himself entitled to be called Jeans boss I cannot say for a certainty
He had grown rather silent upon that subject and rather inclined to keep himself in the background as Jean grew older and more determined in her ways
But certainly he was Jeans one confidential friend her pal
So Lite perforce listened while Jean told him the plot of her story
And when she asked him in all earnestness what he thought would be best for the tragic element ghosts or Indians Lite meditated gravely upon the subject and then suggested that she put in both
That is why Jean lavishly indulged in mysterious footsteps all through the first chapter and then opened the second with bloodcurdling warwhoops that chilled the soul of her heroine and led her to suspect that the rocks behind the cabin concealed the forms of painted savages
Her imagination must have been stimulated by her new work which called for wild rides after posses and wilder flights away from the outlaws while the flash of blank cartridges and the smokepots of disaster by fire added their spectacular effect to a scene now and then
Jean of course was invariably the wild rider who fled in a blond wig and Muriels clothes from pursuing villains or dashed up to the sheriffs office to give the alarm
Frequently she fired the blank cartridges until Lite warned her that blank cartridges would ruin her gunbarrel after which she insisted upon using bullets to the secret trepidation of the villains who must stand before her and who could never quite grasp the fact that Jean knew exactly where those bullets were going to land
She would sit in her room at the Lazy A when the sun and the big black automobile and the painted workers were gone and write feverishly of ghosts and Indians and the fair maiden who endured so much and the brave hero who dared so much and loved so well
Lee Milligan she visualized as the human wolf who looked with desire upon Lillian
Gil Huntley became the hero as the story unfolded and while I have told you absolutely nothing about Jeans growing acquaintance with these two you may draw your own conclusions from the place she made for them in her book that she was writing
And you may also form some idea of what Lite Avery was living through during those days when his work and his pride held him apart and Jean did stunts to her hearts content with these others
A letter from the higherups in the Great Western Company written just after a trial run of the first picture wherein Jean had worked had served to stimulate Burns appetite for the spectacular so that the stunts became more and more the features of his pictures
Muriel Gay was likely to become the most famous photo play actress in the West he believed
That is she would if Jean continued to double for her in everything save the straight dramatic work
Jean did not care just at that time how much glory Muriel Gay was collecting for work that Jean herself had done
Jean was experiencing the first thrills of seeing her name written upon the face of fat weekly checks that promised the fulfillment of her hopes and she would not listen to Lite when he ventured a remonstrance against some of the things she told him about doing
Jean was seeing the Lazy A restored to its old time homelike prosperity
She was seeing her dad there going tranquilly about the everyday business of the ranch holding his head well up and looking every man straight in the eye
She could not and she would not let even Lite persuade her to give up risking her neck for the money the risk would bring her
If she could change these dreams to reality by dashing madly about on Pard while Pete Lowry wound yards and yards of narrow gray film around something on the inside of his camera and watched her with that little secret smile on his face and while Robert Grant Burns waddled here and there with his hands on his hips and watched her also and while villains pursued or else fled before her and Lee Milligan appeared furiously upon the scene in various guises to rescue herif she could win her dads freedom and the Lazy As possession by doing these foolish things she was perfectly willing to risk her neck and let Muriel receive the applause
She did not know that she was doubling the profit on these Western pictures which Robert Grant Burns was producing
She did not know that it would have hastened the attainment of her desires had her name appeared in the cast as the girl who put the punches in the plays
She did not know that she was being cheated of her rightful reward when her name never appeared anywhere save on the payroll and the weekly checks which seemed to her so magnificently generous
In her ignorance of what Gil Huntley called the movie game she was perfectly satisfied to give the best service of which she was capable and she never once questioned the justice of Robert Grant Burns
Jean started a savings account in the little bank where her father had opened an account before she was born and Lite was made to writhe inwardly with her boasting
Lite if you please had long ago started a savings account at that same bank and had lately cut out poker and even pool from among his joys that his account might fatten the faster
He had the same object which Jean had lately adopted so zealously but he did not tell her these things
He listened instead while Jean read gloatingly her balance and talked of what she would do when she had enough saved to buy back the ranch
She had stolen unwittingly the air castle which Lite had been three years building but he did not say a word about it to Jean
Wistful eyed but smiling with his lips he would sit while Jean spoiled whole sheets of perfectly good storypaper just figuring and estimating and building castles with the dollar sign
If Robert Grant Burns persisted in his mania for featurestuff and punches in his pictures Jean believed that she would have a fair start toward buying back the Lazy A long before her book was published and had brought her the thousands and thousands of dollars she was sure it would bring
Very soon she could go boldly to a lawyer and ask him to do something about her fathers case
Just what he should do she did not quite know and Lite did not seem to be able to tell her but she thought she ought to find out just how much the trial had cost
And she wished she knew how to get about setting some one on the trail of Art Osgood
Jean was sure that Art Osgood knew something about the murder and she frequently tried to make Lite agree with her
Sometimes she was sure that Art Osgood was the murderer and would argue and point out her reasons to Lite
Art had been working for her uncle and rode often to the Lazy A
He had not been friendly with Johnny Croftbut then nobody had been very friendly with Johnny Croft
Still Art Osgood was less friendly with Johnny than most of the men in the country and just after the murder he had left the country
Jean laid a good deal of stress upon the circumstance of Art Osgoods leaving on that particular afternoon and she seemed to resent it because no one had tried to find Art
No one had seemed to think his going at that time had any significance or any bearing upon the murder because he had been planning to leave and had announced that he would go that day
Jeans mind as her bank account grew steadily to something approaching dignity worked back and forth incessantly over the circumstances surrounding the murder in spite of Lites peculiar attitude toward the subject which Jean felt but could not understand since he invariably assured her that he believed her dad was innocent when she asked him outright
Sometimes in the throes of literary composition she could not think of the word that she wanted
Her eyes then would wander around familiar objects in the shabby little room and frequently they would come to rest upon her fathers saddle or her fathers chaps the chaps especially seemed potent reminders of her father and drew her thoughts to him and held them there
The worn leather stained with years of hard usage and wrinkled permanently where they had shaped themselves to his legs in the saddle brought his big bluff presence vividly before her when she was in a certain receptive mood
She would forget all about her story and the riding and shooting and roping she had done that day to appease the clamorous professional appetite of Robert Grant Burns and would sit and stare and think and think
Always her thoughts traveled in a wide circle and came back finally to the starting point to free her father and to give him back his home she must have money
To have money she must earn it she must work for it
So then she would give a great sigh of relaxed nervous tension and go back to her heroine and the Indians and the mysterious footsteps that marched on moonlight nights up and down a long porch just outside windows that frequently framed white scared faces with wide horrorstricken eyes which saw nothing of the marcher though the steps still went up and down
It was very creepy in spots
It was so creepy that one evening when Lite had come to smoke a cigarette or two in her company and to listen to her account of the days happenings Lite noticed that when she read the creepy passages in her story she glanced frequently over her shoulder
You want to cut out this story writing he said abruptly when she paused to find the next page
Its bad enough to work like you do in the pictures
This is going a little too strong youre as jumpy tonight as a guilty conscience
Cut it out
Im all right
Im just doing that for dramatic effect
This is very weird Lite
I ought to have a green shade on the lamp to get the proper effect
I dont you thinkerthose footsteps are terribly mysterious
Lite looked at her sharply for a minute
I sure do he said drily
Where did you get the idea Jean
Out of my head she told him airily and went on reading while Lite studied her curiously
That night Jean awoke and heard stealthy footsteps like a man walking in his socks and no boots going all through the house but never coming to her room
She did not get up to see who it was but lay perfectly still and heard her heart thump
When she saw a dim yellow ray of light under the door which opened into the kitchen she drew the blanket over her head and got no comfort whatever from the feel of her sixshooter close against her hand
The next morning she told herself that she had given in to a fine case of nerves and that the mysterious footsteps of her story had become mixed up with the midnight wanderings of a packrat that had somehow gotten into the house
Then she remembered the bar of light under the door and the packrat theory was spoiled
She had taken the board off the doorway into the kitchen so that she could use the cookstove
The man could have come in if he had wanted to and that knowledge she found extremely disquieting
She went all through the house that morning looking and wondering
The livingroom was now the dressingroom of Muriel and her mother and the makeup scattered over the centertable was undisturbed the wardrobe of the two women had apparently been left untouched
Yet she was sure that some one had been prowling in there in the night
She gave up the puzzle at last and went back to her breakfast but before the company arrived in the big black automobile she had found a stout hasp and two staples and had fixed the door which led from her room into the kitchen so that she could fasten it securely on the inside
Jean did not tell Lite about the footsteps
She was afraid that he might insist upon her giving up staying at the Lazy A Lite did not approve of it anyway and it would take very little encouragement in the way of extra risk to make him stubborn about it
Lite could be very obstinate indeed upon occasion and she was afraid he might take a stubborn streak about this and perhaps ride over every night to make sure she was all right or do something equally unnecessary and foolish
She did not know Lite as well as she imagined which is frequently the case with the closest of friends
As a matter of fact Jean had never spent one night alone on the ranch even though she did believe she was doing so
Lite had a homestead a few miles away upon which he was supposed to be sleeping occasionally to prove his good faith in the settlement
Instead of spending his nights there however he rode over and slept in the gable loft over the old granary where no one ever went and he left every morning just before the sky lightened with dawn
He did not know that Jean was frightened by the sound of footsteps but he had heard the man ride up to the stable and dismount and he had followed him to the house and watched him through the uncurtained windows and had kept his fingers close to his gun all the while
Jean did not dream of anything like that but Lite going about his work with the easy calm that marked his manner always was quite as puzzled over the errand of the nightprowler as was Jean herself
For three years Lite had lain aside the mystery of the footprints on the kitchen floor on the night after the inquest as a puzzle he would probably never solve
He had come to remember them as a vagrant incident that carried no especial meaning
But now they seemed to carry a new significanceif only he could get at the key
For three years he had gone along quietly working and saving all he could and looking after Jean in an unobtrusive way believing that Aleck was guilty and being careful to give no hint of that belief to any one
And now Jean herself seemed to be leading him unconsciously face to face with doubt and mystery
It tantalized him
He knew the prowler and for that reason he was all the more puzzled
What had he wanted or expected to find
Lite was tempted to face the man and ask him but on second thought he knew that would be foolish
He would say nothing to Jean
He thanked the Lord she slept soundly
and he would wait and see what happened
Jean herself was thoughtful all that day and was slow to lighten her mood or her manner even when Gil Huntley rode beside her to location and talked enthusiastically of the great work she was doing for a beginner and of the greater work she would do in the future if only she took advantage of her opportunities
It cant go on like this forever he told her impressively for the second time before he was sure of her attention and her interest
Think of you working extra under a threeday guarantee
Why youre whats making the pictures
I had a letter from a friend of mine hes with the Universal
Hed been down to see one of our picturesthat first one you worked in
You remember how you came down off that bluff and how you roped me and jerked me down off the bank just as Id got a bead on Lee
Say
that picture was a RIOT
Gloomy says he never saw a picture get the hand that scene got
And he wanted to know who was doubling for Gay up here
You see he got next that it was a double he knows darned well Gay never could put over that line of stuff
The photography was dandyPetes right there when it comes to camera work anywayand that run down the bluff he said had people standing on their hind legs even before the rope scene
You could tell it was a girl and no man doubling the part
Gloomy says everybody around the studio has begun to watch for our releases and go just to see you ride and rope and shoot
And Gay gets all the pressnotices
Say it makes me sick
He looked at Jean wistfully
The trouble is you dont realize what a raw deal youre getting he said with much discontent in his tone
As an extra youre getting fine treatment and fine pay I admit that
But the point is youve no business being an extra
Where you belong is playing leads
You dont know what that means but I do
Burns is just using you to boost Muriel Gay and I say its the rawest deal I ever saw handed out in the picture game and believe me Ive seen some raw deals
Now now dont get peevish Gil
Jeans drawl was soft and her eyes were friendly and amused
So far had their friendship progressed
Its awfully dear of you to want to see me a real leading lady
I appreciate it and I wont take off that lock of hair I said Id take when I shoot you in the foreground
Burns wants a real thrilling effect close up and hes told me five times to remember and keep my face turned away from the camera so they wont see it isnt Gay
If I turn around there will have to be a retake he says and you wont like that Gil not after youve heard a bullet zip past your ear so close that it will fan your hair
Arearent you afraid of me Gil
Afraid of you
Gils horse swung closer and Gils eyes threatened the opening of a tacitly forbidden subject
Because if you get nervous and move the least little bit To make it look real as Bobby described the scene to me Ive got to shoot the instant you stop to gather yourself for a spring at me
Its that lightning draw business I have to do Gil
Im to stand three quarters to the camera with my face turned away watching you
You keep coming and you stop just an instant when youre almost within reach of me
In that instant I have to grab my gun and shoot and it has to look as if I got you Gil
Ive got to come pretty close in order to bring the gun in line with you for the camera
Bobby wants to show off the quick draw that Lite Avery taught me
Thats to be the punch in the scene
I showed him this morning what it is like and Bobby is just tickled to death
You see I dont shoot the way they usually do in pictures I should say not
Gil interrupted admiringly
You havent seen that quick work either
Itll look awfully real Gil and you mustnt dodge or duck whatever you do
It will be just as if you really were a man Im deadly afraid of that has me cornered at last against that ledge
Im going to do it as if I meant it
That will mean that when you stop and kind of measure the distance meaning to grab me before I can do anything Ill draw and shoot from the level of my belt no higher Gil or it wont be the lightningdraw as advertised
I wont have time to take a fine aim you know
Listen
said Gil leaning toward her with his eyes very earnest
I know all about that
I heard you and Burns talking about it
You go ahead and shoot and put that scene over big
Dont you worry about me Im going to play up to you if I can
Listen
Petes just waiting for a chance to register your face on the film
Burns has planned his scenes to prevent that but were just lying low till the chance comes
Its got to be dramatic and its got to seem accidental
Get me
I shouldnt have told you but I cant seem to trick you Jean
Youre the kind of a girl a fellows got to play fair with
Bobby has told me five times already to remember and keep my face away from the camera Jean pointed out the second time
Makes me feel as if I had lost my nose or was crosseyed or something
I do feel as if Id lose my job Gil
No you wouldnt all hed do would be to have a retake of the whole scene and maybe step around like a turkey in the snow and swear to himself
Anyway you can forget what Ive said if youll feel more comfortable
Its up to Pete and me and well put it over smooth or we wont do it at all
Bobby wont realize its happened till he hears from it afterwards
Neither will you
He turned his greasepainted face toward her hearteningly and smiled as endearingly as the sinister painted lines would allow
Listen
he repeated as a final encouragement because he had sensed her preoccupation and had misread it for worry over the picture
You go ahead and shoot and dont bother about me
Make it real
Shoot as close as you like
If you pink me a little I wont careif youll promise to be my nurse
I want a vacation anyway
CHAPTER XIV PUNCH VERSES PRESTIGE It seems to be a popular belief among those who are unfamiliar with the business of making motion pictures that all dangerous or difficult feats are merely tricks of the camera and that the actors themselves take no risks whatever
The truth is that they take a good many more risks than the camera ever records and that directors who worship what they call punch in their scenes are frequently as tender of the physical safety of their actors as was Napoleon or any other great warrior who measured results rather than wounds
Robert Grant Burns had discovered that he had at least two persons in his company who were perfectly willing to do anything he asked them to do
He had set tasks before Jean Douglas that many a man would have refused without losing his selfrespect and Jean had performed those tasks with enthusiasm
She had let herself down over a nasty bit of the rimrock whose broken line extended half around the coulee bluff with only her rope between herself and broken bones and with her blond wig properly tousled and her face turned always towards the rock wall lest the camera should reveal the fact that she was not Muriel Gay
She had climbed that same rockrim with the aid of that same rope and with her face hidden as usual from the camera
She had been bound and gagged and flung across Gil Huntleys saddle and carried away at a sharp gallop and she had afterwards freed herself from her bonds in the semidarkness of a hut that half concealed her features and had stolen the knife from Gil Huntleys belt while he slept and crept away to where the horses were picketed
In the revealing light of a very fine mooneffect which was a triumph of Petes skill she slashed a rope that held a highstrung mustang so called in the scenario and had leaped upon his bare back and gone hurtling out of that scene and into another where she was riding furiously over dangerously rough ground the whole outlaw band in pursuit and silhouetted against the skyline and the moon which was another photographic triumph of Pete Lowry
Gil Huntley had also done many things that were risky
Jean had shot at him with real bullets so many times that her nervousness on this particular day was rather unaccountable to him
Jean had lassoed him and dragged him behind Pard through brush
She had pulled him from a quicksand bedmade of cement that showed a strong tendency to set about his form before she could rescue himand she had fought with him on the edge of a cliff and had thrown him over and his director anxious for the punch that was his fetish had insisted on a panorama of the fall so that there was no chance for Gil to save himself the bruises he got
Gil Huntleys part it was always to die a violent death or to be captured spectacularly because he was the villain whose horrible example must bear a moral to youthful brains
Since Jean had become one of the company he nearly always died at her hands or was captured by her
This left Muriel Gay unruffled and unhurt so that she could weep and accept the love of Lee Milligan in the artistic ending of which Robert Grant Burns was so fond
Jean had never before considered it necessary to warn Gil and implore him not to be nervous and Gil took her solicitude as an encouraging sign and was visibly cheered thereby
He knew little of guns and fine marksmanship and he did not know that it is extremely difficult to shoot a revolver accurately and instantaneously whereas Jean knew very well that Gil Huntley might be thrown off ledges every day in the week without taking the risk he would take that day
The scene was to close a full reel of desperate attempts upon the part of Gil Huntley to win Muriel such desperate attempts indeed that Muriel Gay spent most of the time sitting at ease in the shade talking with Lee Milligan who was two thirds in love with her and had half his love returned while Jean played her part for her
Sometimes Muriel would be called upon to assume the exact pose which Jean had assumed in a previous scene for closeup that would reveal to audiences Muriels wellknown prettiness and help to carry along the deception
Each morning the two stood side by side and were carefully inspected by Robert Grant Burns to make sure that hair and costumes were exactly alike in the smallest detail
This also helped to carry on the deceptionto those who were not aware of Muriels limitations
Their faces were not at all alike and that is why Jeans face must never be seen in a picture
This shooting scene was a fitting climax to a long and desperate chase over a difficult trail so difficult that Pard stumbled and fellsupposedly with a broken legand Jean must run on and on afoot and climb over rocks and spring across dangerous crevices
She was not supposed to know where her flight was taking her
Sometimes the camera caught her silhouetted against the sky Burns was partial to skyline silhouettes and sometimes it showed her quite closein which case it would be Muriel instead of Jeanclinging desperately to the face of a ledge ledges were also favorite scenes and seeking with hands or feet for a hold upon the rough face of the rock
During the last two or three scenes Gil Huntley had been shown gaining upon her
So they came to the location where the shooting scene was to be made that morning
Burns with the camera and Pete and Muriel and her mother and Lee Milligan drove to the place in the machine
Jean and Gil Huntley found them comfortably disposed in the shade out of range of the camera which Pete was setting up somewhat closer than usual under the direction of Burns
There wont be any rehearsal of this Burns stated at last stepping back
When its done if you dont bungle the scene itll be done
You stand here Jean and kind of lean against the rock as if youre all in from that chase
You hear Gil coming and you start forward and listen and lookhow far can she turn Pete without showing too much of her face
Pete squinted into the finder and gave the information
Well Gil you come from behind that bush
Shell be looking toward you then without turning too much
You grin and come up with that eager Igotyounow look
Dont hurry too much well give this scene plenty of time
This is the feature scene
Jean youre at the end of your rope
You couldnt run another step if you wanted to and youre cornered anyway so you cant get away get me
Youre scared
Did you ever get scared in your life
Yes said Jean simply remembering last night when she had pulled the blanket over her head
Well you think of that time you were scared
And you make yourself think that youre going to shoot the thing that scared you
You dont put in half the punch when you shoot blanks Ive noticed that all along
So thats why you shoot a bullet
See
And you come as close to Gil as you can and not hit him
Gil when youre shot you go down all in a heap you know what I mean
And Jean when he falls you start and lean forward looking at himremember and keep your face away from the cameraand then you start toward him kind of horrified
The scene stops right there just as you start towards him
Then Gay takes it up and does the remorse and horror stuff because shes killed a man
That will be a closeup
All right now take your places
Sure your gun is loose so you can pull it quick
Thats the feature of this scene remember
You want to get it across BIG
And make it realthe scare and all that
Hey you women get behind the camera
Bullets glance sometimes and play the very mischief
He looked all around to make sure that everything was as it should be faced Jean again and raised his hand
All ready
Start your action
Camera
Jean had never before been given so much dramatic work to do and Burns watched her anxiously wishing that he dared cut the scene in two and give Muriel that tense interval when Gil Huntley came creeping into the scene from behind the bush
But after the first few seconds his strained expression relaxed anxiety gave place to something like surprise
Jean stood leaning heavily against the rock panting from the flight of the day beforefor so must emotion be carried over into the next day when photo players work at their profession
Her face was dropped upon her arms flung up against the rock in an attitude of complete exhaustion and despair
Burns involuntarily nodded his head approvingly the girl had the idea all right even if she never had been trained to act a part
Come into the scene Gil
he commanded when Jean made a move as though she was tempted to drop down upon the ground and sob hysterically
Jean register that you hear him coming
Jeans head came up and she listened every muscle stiffening with fear
She turned her face toward Gil who stopped and looked at her most villainously
Gil you must know had come from legitimate and was a clever actor
Jean recoiled a little before the leering face of him pressed her shoulder hard against the ledge that had trapped her and watched him in an agony of fear
One felt that she did though one could not see her face
Gil spoke a few words and came on with a certain tigerish assurance of his power but Jean did not move a muscle
She had backed as far away from him as she could get
She was not the kind to weep and plead with him
She just waited and one felt that she was keyed up to the supreme moment of her life
Gil came closer and closer and there was a look in his eyes that almost frightened Jean accustomed as she had become to his acting a part there was an intensity of purpose which she instinctively felt was real
She did not know what it was he had in mind but whatever it was she knew what it meant
He was almost within reach so close that one saw Jean shrink a little from his nearness
He stopped and gathered himself for a quick forward lunge The two women screamed though they had been expecting that swift drawing of Jeans gun and the shot that seemed to sound the instant her hand dropped
Gil stiffened and his hand flew up to his temple
His eyes became two staring questions that bored into the soul of Jean
His hand dropped to his side and his head sagged forward
He lurched tried to steady himself and then went down limply
Jean dropped her gun and darted toward him her face like chalk as she turned it for one horrified instant toward Burns
She went down on her knees and lifted Gils head looking at the red blotch on his temple and the trickle that ran down his cheek
She laid his head down with a gentleness wholly unconscious and looked again at Burns
Ive killed him she said in a small dry flat voice
She put out her hands gropingly and fell forward across Gils inert body
It was the first time in her life that Jean had ever fainted
Stop the camera
Burns croaked tardily and Pete stopped turning
Pete had that little twisted grin on his face and he was perfectly calm and selfpossessed
You sure got the punch that time Burns he remarked unfeelingly while he held his palm over the lens and gave the crank another turn or two to divide that scene from the next
Shes fainted
Shes hit him
cried Burns and waddled over to where the two of them lay
The two women drew farther away clinging to each other with excited exclamations
And then Gil Huntley lifted himself carefully so as not to push Jean upon the ground and when he was sitting up he took her in his arms with some remorse and a good deal of tenderness
How was that for a punch
he inquired of his director
I didnt tell her I was going to furnish the bloodsponge I thought it might rattle her
I never thought shed take it so hard Robert Grant Burns stopped and looked at him in heavy silence
Good Lord
he snapped out at last
I dunno whether to fire you off the jobor raise your salary
You got the punch all right
And the chances are youve ruined her nerve for shooting into the bargain
He stood looking down perturbedly at Gil who was smoothing Jeans hair back from her forehead after the manner of men who feel tenderly toward the woman who cries or faints in their presence
Im after the punch every time Burns went on ruefully but theres no use being a hog about it
Wheres that waterbag Lee
Go get it out of the machine
Say
Cant you women do something besides stand there and howl
Nobodys hurt or going to be
While Muriel and Gil Huntley did what they could to bring Jean back to consciousness and composure Robert Grant Burns paced up and down and debated within himself a subject which might have been called punch versus prestige
Should he let that scene stand or should he order a retake because Jean had after all done the dramatic part the remorse stuff
Of course when Pete sent the film in the trimmers could cut the scene they probably would cut the scene just where Gil went down in a decidedly realistic heap
But it hurt the professional soul of Robert Grant Burns to retake a scene so compellingly dramatic because it had been so absolutely real
Jean was sitting up with her back against the ledge looking rather pale and feeling exceedingly foolish while Gil Huntley explained to her about the bloodsponge and how he had held it concealed in his hand until the right moment and had used it in the interest of realism and not to frighten her as she might have reason to suspect
Gil Huntley was showing a marked tendency to repeat himself
He had three times assured her earnestly that he did not mean to scare her so when the voice of the chief reminded him that this was merely an episode in the days work
He jumped up and gave his attention to Burns
Gil take that same position you had when you fell
Put a little more blood on your face you wiped most of it off
That right leg is sprawled out too far
Draw it up a little
Throw out your left arm a little more
Whoa Enough is plenty
Now Gay you take Jeans gun and hold it down by your side where her hand dropped right after she fired
You stand right about here where her tracks are
Get INTO her tracks
Were picking up the scene right where Gil fell
She looked straight into the camera and spoiled the rest or Id let it go in
Some acting if you ask me seeing it wasnt acting at all
He sent one of his slanteyed glances toward Jean who bit her lips and looked away
Lean forward a little and hold that gun like you knew what it was made for anyway
He regarded Muriel glumly
Say
that aint a stick of candy youre trying to hide in your skirt he pointed out with an exasperated rising inflection at the end of the sentence
John Jimpson
If I could take you two girls to pieces and make one out of the two of you Id have an actress that could play Western leads maybe
Oh wellthunder
All you can do is put over the action so theyll forget the gun
Say you drop it the second the camera starts
You pick up the action where Jean dropped the gun and started for Gil
See if you can put it over the way she did
She really thought shed killed him remember
You saw the real honesttoJohn horrordope that time
Now see how close you can copy it
All ready
START your ACTION
he barked
Camera
Brutally absorbed in his work he might be callous to the tragedy in Jeans eyes at what might have happened unfeeling in his greedy seizure of her horror as good stuff for Muriel Gay to mimic
Yet the mans energy was dynamic his callousness was born of his passion for the making of good pictures
He swept even Jean out of the emotional whirlpool and into the calm steady current of the work they had to do
He instructed Pete to count as spoiled those fifteen feet of film which recorded Jeans swift horror
But Pete Lowry did not always follow slavishly his instructions
He sent the film in as it was without comment
Then he and Gil Huntley counted on their fingers the number of days that would probably elapse before they might hope to hear the result and exchanged knowing glances now and then when Robert Grant Burns seemed especially careful that Jeans face should not be seen by the recording eye of the camera
And they waited and after awhile they began to show a marked interest in the mail from the west
CHAPTER XV A LEADING LADY THEY WOULD MAKE OF JEAN Sometimes events follow docilely the plans that would lead them out of the future of possibilities and into the present of actualities and sometimes they bring with them other events which no man may foresee unless he is indeed a prophet
You would never think for instance that Gil Huntley and his blood sponge would pull from the future a chain of incidents that would eventuallywell never mind what
Just follow the chain of incidents and see what lies at the end
Pete Lowry and Gil had planned cunningly for a certain readjustment of Jeans standing in the company for no deeper reasons than their genuine liking for the girl and a common human impulse to have a hand in the ordering of their little world
In ten days Robert Grant Burns received a letter from Dewitt president of the Great Western Film Company which amply fulfilled those plans and as I said opened the way for other events quite unforeseen
There were certain orders from the higherups which Robert Grant Burns must heed
They were briefly the immediate transfer of Muriel Gay to the position of leading woman in a new company which was being sent to Santa Barbara to make light comedydramas
Robert Grant Burns grunted when he read that though it was a step up the ladder for Muriel which she would be glad to take
The next paragraph instructed him to place the young woman who had been doubling for Miss Gay in the position which Miss Gay would leave vacant
It was politely suggested that he adapt the leading womans parts to the ability of this young woman which meant that he must write his scenarios especially with her in mind
He was informed that he should feature the young woman in her remarkable horsemanship etc
It was pointed out that her work was being noticed in the Western features which Robert Grant Burns had been sending in and that other film companies would no doubt make overtures shortly in the hope of securing her services
Under separate cover they were mailing a contract which would effectually forestall such overtures and they were relying upon him to see that she signed up with the Great Western as per contract
Finally it was suggested since Mr Dewitt chose always to suggest rather than to command that Robert Grant Burns consider the matter of writing a series of short stories having some connecting thread of plot and featuring this Miss Douglas
This by the way was the beginning of the serial form of motion picture plays which has since become so popular
Robert Grant Burns read that letter through slowly and then sat down heavily in an old armchair in the hotel office lighted one of his favorite fat black cigars and mouthed it absently while he read the letter through again
He said John Jimpson
just above a whisper
He held the letter in his two hands and regarded it strangely
Then he looked up caught the quizzical inquiring glance of Pete Lowry and beckoned that secretsmiling individual over to him
Read that
he grunted
Read it and tell me what you think of it
Pete Lowry read it carefully and grinned when he handed it back
He did not however tell Robert Grant Burns just exactly what he thought of it
He merely said that it had to come sometime he guessed
She cant put over the dramatic stuff objected Robert Grant Burns
Shes got the face for it all right and when she registers real emotions it gets over big
The bottledup kind of people always do
But shes never acted an emotion she didnt feel How about that allin stuff and the listeningand waiting business she put across before she took a shot at Gil that time she fainted
Pete reminded him
If you ask me that little girl can act
Well whether she can or not shes got to try it said Burns with some foreboding
Shes been going big with Gay to do all the closeup dramatic work
The trouble is Pete that girl always does as she darn pleases
If I put her opposite Lee in a scene and tell her to act like she is in love with him and that hes to kiss her and shes to kiss back he flung out his hands expressively
You must know the rest as well as I do
Shed turn around and give me a calldown and get on her horse and ride off and I and my picture could go to thunder for all of her
Thats the point she aint been through the mill
She dont know anything about taking ordersfrom me or anybody else
It is a pity that Lite did not hear that
He might have amended the statement a little
Jean had been taking orders enough she knew a great deal about receiving ultimatums
The trouble was that she seldom paid any attention to them
Lite was accustomed to that but Robert Grant Burns was not and it irked him sore
Well shes sure got the screen personality Pete defended
Ive said it all along
That girl dont have to act
Put her in the part and she is the part
Shes got something better than technique Burns
Shes got imagination
She puts herself in a character and lives it
Put her on a horse and she does Burns conceded gloomily
But will you tell me what kind of work shell make of interior scenes and love scenes and all that
Youve got to have it to pad out your story
You cant let your leading character do a whole two or threereel picture on horseback
There wouldnt be any contrast
Dewitt dont know that girl the way I do
If hed had to sidestep and scheme and give in the way Ive done to keep her working he wouldnt put her playing straight leads not until shed had a year or two of training Taming is a better word Pete suggested drily
Therell be fun when she gets to playing love scenes opposite Lee
You better let him take the heavies and put Gil in for leads Burns
Robert Grant Burns was so cast down by the prospect that he made no attempt to reply beyond grunting something about preferring to drive a team of balky mules to making Jean do something she did not want to do
But such is the mind trained to a profession insensibly he drifted away into the world of his imagination and began to draw therefrom the first tenuous threads of a plot wherein Jeans peculiar accomplishments were to be featured
Robert Grant Burns had long ago learned to adjust himself to circumstances which in themselves were not to his liking
He adjusted himself now to the idea of making Jean the Western star his employers seemed to think was inevitable
That night before he went to bed he wrote a play which had in it fiftytwo scenes
Thirtyfive of them were what is known technically as exteriors
In most of them Jean was to ride on horseback through wild places
The rest were dramatic closeups
Robert Grant Burns went over it carefully when it was finished and groaning inwardly he cut out two love scenes which were tense and which Muriel Gay and Lee Milligan would have eaten up as he mentally expressed it
The love interest he realized bitterly must be touched upon lightly in his scenarios from now on which would have lightened appreciably the heart of Lite Avery if he had only known it and would have erased from his mind a good many depressing visions of Jean as the film sweetheart of those movie men whom he secretly hated
Jean did not hesitate five minutes before she signed the contract which Burns presented to her the next morning
She was human and she had learned enough about the business to see that speaking from a purely professional point of view she was extremely fortunate
Not every girl surely can hope to jump in a few weeks from the lowly position of an inexperienced extra to the supposedly exalted one of leading woman
And to her that hundred dollars a week which the contract insured her looked a fortune
It spelled home to her and the vindication of her beloved dad of whom she dared not think sometimes it hurt her so
Her book was not progressing as fast as she had expected when she began it
She had been working at it sporadically now for eight weeks and she had only ten chapters doneand some of these were terribly short
She had looked through all of the novels that she owned and had computed the average number of chapters in each thirty she decided would be a good conservative number to write
She had even divided those thirty into three parts and had impartially allotted ten to adventure ten to mystery and horror and ten to love making
Such an arrangement should please everybody surely and need only be worked out smoothly to prove most satisfying
But as it happened comedy would creep into the mystery and horror which she mentally lumped together as agony
Adventure ran riot and straight love making chapters made her sleepy they bored her so
She had tried one or two and she had found it impossible to concentrate her mind upon them
Instead she had sat and planned what she would do with the money that was steadily accumulating in the bank a pitiful little sum to be sure to those who count by the thou sands but cheering enough to Jean who had never before had any money of her own
So she signed the contract and worked that day so lightheartedly that Robert Grant Burns forgot his pessimism
When the light began to fade and grow yellow and the big automobile went purring down the trail to town she rode on to the Bar Nothing to find Lite and tell him how fortune had come and tapped her on the shoulder
She did not see Lite anywhere about the ranch and so she did not put her hopes and her plans and her good fortune into speech
She did see her Aunt Ella who straightway informed her that people were talking about the way she rode here and there with those paintedup people and let the men put their arms around her and make love to her
Her Aunt Ella made it perfectly plain to Jean that she for one did not consider it respectable
Her Aunt Ella said that Carl was going to do something about it if things werent changed pretty quick
Jean did not appear to regard her aunts disapproval as of any importance whatever but the words stung
She had herself worried a little over the lovemaking scenes which she knew she would now be called upon to play
Jean you will have observed was not given to sentimental adventurings and she disliked the idea of letting Lee Milligan make love to her the way he had made love to Muriel Gay through picture after picture
She would do it she supposed if she had to she wanted the salary
But she would hate it intolerably
She made reply with sarcasm which she knew would particularly irritate her Aunt Ella and left the house feeling that she never wanted to enter it again as long as she lived
The sight of her uncle standing beside Pard in an attitude of disgusted appraisement of the new Navajo blanket and the silvertrimmed bridle and tapideros which Burns had persuaded her to add to her riding outfitfor photographic effectbrought a hot flush of resentment
She went up quietly enough however
Indeed she went up so quietly that he started when she appeared almost beside him and picked up Pards reins and took the stirrup to mount and ride away
She did not speak to him at all she had not spoken to him since that night when the little brown bird had died
Though perhaps that was because she had managed to keep out of his way
I see youve been staking yourself to a new bridle Carl began in a tone quite as sour as his look
You must have bought out all the tin decorations they had in stock didnt you
Jean swung up into the saddle before she looked at him
If I did its my own affair she retorted
I paid for the tin decorations with my own money
Oh you did
Well you might have been in better business than paying for that kind of thing
You might he sneered up at her have been paying for your keep these last three years if youve got more money of your own than you know what to do with
Jean could not ride off under the sting of that gratuitous insult
She held Pard quiet and looked down at him with hate in her eyes
I expect she said in a queer quiet wrath to prove before long that my own money has been paying for my keep these last three years for that and for other things that did not benefit me in the least
Id like to know what you mean by that
Carl caught Pard by the bridlerein and looked up at her in a white fury that startled even Jean accustomed as she was to his sudden rages that contrasted with his sullen attitude toward the world
What do you think I would mean
Let go my bridle
I dont want to quarrel with you
What did you mean by provingwhat do you expect to prove
His hand was heavy on the rein so that Pard began to fret under the restraint
Youve got to quit running around all over the country with them show folks and stay at home and behave yourself
Youve got to quit hanging out at the Lazy A Ive stood as much as Im going to stand of your performances
You get down off that horse and go into the house and behave yourself thats what youll do
If you havent got any shame or decency Jean scarcely knew what she did just then
She must have dug Pard with her spurs because the first thing that she realized was the lunge he gave
Carls hold slipped from the rein as he was jerked sidewise
He made an ineffective grab at Jeans skirt and he called her a name she had never heard spoken before in her life
A rod or so away she pulled up and turned to face him but the words she would have spoken stuck in her throat
She had never seen Carl Douglas look like that she had seen him when he was furious she had seen him when he sulked but she had never seen him look like that
He called her to come back
He made threats of what he would do if she refused to obey him
He shook his fist at her
He behaved like a man temporarily robbed of his reason his eyes as he came up glaring at her were the eyes of a madman
Jean felt a tremor of dread while she looked at him and listened to him
He was almost within reach of her again when she wheeled and went off up the trail at a run
She looked back often half fearing that he would get a horse and follow her but he stood just where she had left him and he seemed to be still uttering threats and groundless accusations as long as she was in sight
CHAPTER XVI FOR ONCE AT LEAST LITE HAD HIS WAY Half a mile she galloped and met Lite coming home
She glanced over her shoulder before she pulled Pard down to a walk and Lites greeting as he turned and rode alongside her was a question
He wanted to know what was the matter with her
He listened with his old manner of repression while she told him and he made no comment whatever until she had finished
You must have made him pretty sore he said dispassionately
I dont think myself that you ought to stay over to the ranch alone
Why dont you do as he says
And go back to the Bar Nothing
Jean shivered a little
Nothing could make me go back there
Lite you dont understand
He acted like a crazy man and I hadnt said anything to stir him up like that
He wasLite he scared me
I couldnt stay on the ranch with him
I couldnt be in the same room with him
You cant go on staying at the Lazy A Lite told her flatly
Theres no other place where Id stay
You could Lite pointed out stay in town and go back and forth with the rest of the bunch
It would be a lot better any way you look at it
It would be a lot worse
Theres my book I wouldnt have any chance to write on that
And theres the expense
Im saving every nickel I possibly can Lite and you know what for
And theres the bunchI see enough of them during working hours
Id go crazy if I had to live with them
Lite theyve put me in playing leads
Im to get a hundred dollars a week
Just think of that
And Burns says that Ill have to go back to Los Angeles with them when they go this fall because the contract I signed lasts for a year
She sighed
I rode over to tell you about it
It seemed to be good news when I left home
But now its just a part of the black tangle that lifes made up of
Aunt Ella started things off by telling me what a disgrace it is for me to work in these pictures
And Uncle Carl She shivered in spite of herself
I just cant understand Uncle Carls going into such a rage
It wasawful
Lite rode for some distance before he lifted his head or spoke
Then he looked at Jean who was staring straight ahead and seeing nothing save what her thoughts pictured
He did not say a word about her going to Los Angeles
He was the bottledup type the things that hit him hardest he seldom mentioned so by that rule it might be inferred that her going hit hard
But his voice was normally calm and his tone was the tone of authority which Jean knew very well and which nearly always amused her because she firmly believed it to be utterly useless
He said in the tone of an ultimatum If youre bound to stay at the ranch youve got to have somebody with you
Ill ride in and get Hepsy Atwood in the morning
Youre getting thin
I dont believe you take time to cook enough to eat
You cant work on soda crackers and sardines
The old lady wont charge much to come and stay with you
Ill come over after Im through work tomorrow and help her get things looking a little more like living
Youll do nothing of the sort
Jean looked at him mutinously
Im all right just as I am
I wont have her Lite
Thats settled
Sure its settled Lite agreed with more than his usual pertinacity
Ill have her out here by noon and a supply of real grub
How are you fixed for bedding
I wont have her I tell you
Youre always trying to make me do things I wont do
Dont be silly
Sure not
Lite shifted in the saddle with the air of a man who rides at perfect ease with himself and with the world
Shell likely have plenty of bedding of her own he meditated after a brief silence
Lite if you haul Hepsibah out here Ill send her back
Ill haul her out said Lite in a tone of finality but you wont send her back
He paused
She aint much protection maybe he remarked somewhat enigmatically but itll beat staying alone nights
Youyou cant tell who might come prowling around the place
What do you mean
Do you know about Jean caught herself on the verge of betrayal
You want to keep your gun handy
Just on general principles Lite remonstrated
You cant tell its away off from everywhere
I wont have Hepsy Atwood
Havent I enough to drive me mad without her
Is there anybody else that youd rather have
Lite looked at her speculatively
No there isnt
I wont have anybody
It would be a nuisance having some old lady in the house gabbling and gossiping
Im not the least bit afraid except Im not afraid and I like to be alone
I wont have her Lite
Lite said no more about it until they reached the house huddled lonesomely against the barren bluff its windows staring black into the dusk
Jean did not seem to expect Lite to dismount but he did not wait to see what she expected him to do
In his most matter offact manner he dismounted and turned his horse still saddled into the stable with Pard
He preceded Jean up the path and went into the kitchen ahead of her lighted a match and found the lamp and set its flame to brightening the dingy room
Jean had not done much in the way of making that part of the house more attractive
She used the kitchen to cook in because the stove was there and the dishes
She had spread an old braided rug over the brown stain on the floor and she ate in her own room with the door shut
Without being told Lite seemed to know all about her secret aversion to the kitchen
He took up the lamp and went now on a tour of inspection through the house
Jean followed him wondering a little and thinking that this was the way that mysterious stranger came and prowled at night except that he must have used matches to light the way or a candle since the lamp seemed never to be disturbed
Lite went into all the rooms and held the lamp so that its brightness searched out all the corners
He looked into the small stuffy closets
He stood in the middle of her fathers room and seemed to meditate deeply while Jean stood in the doorway and watched him inquiringly
He came back finally to the kitchen and looked into the cupboard as though he was taking an inventory of her supply of provisions
You might cook me some supper Jean he said when he had put the lamp on the table
I see youve got eggs and bacon
Im pretty hungryfor a man that had his dinner six or seven hours ago
Jean cooked supper and they ate together in the kitchen
It did not seem so gruesome with Lite there and she told him some funny things that had happened in her work and mimicked Robert Grant Burns with an accuracy of manner and tone that would have astonished that pompous person a good deal and flattered him not at all
She almost recovered her spirits under the stimulus of Lites presence and she quite forgot that he had threatened her with Hepsibah Atwood
But when he had wiped the dishes and had taken up his hat to go Lite proved how tenaciously his mind could hold to an idea and how even Jean could not quite match him for stubbornness
That mattress in the little bedroom looks all right he said
Ill pack it outside before I go so it will have all day tomorrow out in the sun
Ill have Hepsy bring her own bedding
Wellso long
Jean would have sworn in perfect good faith that Lite led his horse out of the stable mounted it and rode away to the Bar Nothing
He did mount and ride away as far as the mouth of the coulee
But that night he spent in the loft over the shop and he did not sleep five minutes during the night
Most of the time he spent leaning against his rolled bedding smoking and gazing at the silent house where Jean slept
You may interpret that as you will
Jean did not see or hear anything more of him until about four oclock the next afternoon when he drove calmly up to the house and deposited Hepsibah Atwood upon the kitchen steps
He did not wait for Jean to order them away
He hurried the unloading released the wagon brake and drove off
So Jean coming from the spring behind the house really got her first sight of him as he went rattling down to the gate
Jean stood and looked after him twitched her shoulders in a mental yielding of the point for the time being and said Howdado to the old lady
She was not so old as years go fiftyfive or thereabouts
And she could have whispered into Lites ear without standing on her toes or asking him to bend his head
Lite was a tall man at that
She had gray hair that was frizzy around her brows and at the back of her neck and she had an Irish disposition without the brogue to go with it
The first thing she did was to find an axe and chop a lot of fenceposts into firewood as easily as Lite himself could have done it and in other ways proceeded to make herself very much at home
The next day she dipped the spring almost dry and used up all the soap in the house and for three days went around with her skirts tucked up and her arms bare and the soles of her shoes soggy from wet floors
Jean kept out of her way but she owned to herself that after all it was not unpleasant to come home tired and not have to cook a solitary supper and eat it in silent meditation
The third night after Hepsys arrival Jean awoke to hear a mans furtive footsteps in her fathers room
This was the fifth time that the prowler had come in the night and custom had dulled her fear a little
She had not reached the point yet of getting up to see who it was and what he wanted
It was much easier to lie perfectly still with her sixshooter gripped in her hand and wait for him to go
Beyond stealthily trying her door and finding it fastened on the inside he had never shown any disposition to invade her room Tonight was as all other nights when he came and made that mysterious search until he went into the little bedroom where slept Hepsibah Atwood
Jean listened to the faint creaking of old boards which told her that he was approaching Hepsys room and she wondered if Hepsy would hear him
Hepsy did hear him
There was a squeak of the old bedstead that told how a hundred and seventytwo pounds of indignant womanhood was rising to do battle
Whos that
Git outa here or Ill smash you
There was no fear but a great deal of determination in Hepsys voice and there was the sound of her bare feet spatting on the floor
The mans footsteps retreated hurriedly
Jean heard the kitchen door open and slam shut with a shrill squeal of its rusty hinges and the sound of a man running down the path
She heard Hepsy muttering threats while she followed to the door and looked out and she heard the muttering continue while Hepsy returned to bed
It was very comforting
Jean tucked her gun under her pillow laughed to herself for having shuddered under the blankets at the sound of a man so easily put to flight and went to sleep feeling quite secure and for the first time really glad that Hepsibah Atwood was in the house
She listened the next morning to Hepsys colorful account of the affair but she did not tell Hepsy that the man had been there before
She did not even tell her that she had heard the disturbance and was lying with her gun in her hand ready to shoot if he came into her room
For a girl as frank and outspoken as was Jean she had almost as great a talent as Lite for holding her tongue
CHAPTER XVII WHY DONT YOU GIVE THEM SOMETHING REAL
Well you dont seem crazy about it
Whats the matter
Robert Grant Burns stood in his favorite attitude with his hands on his hips and his feet far apart and looked down at Jean with a secret anxiety in his eyes
Without realizing it in the least Jeans opinion had come to have a certain weight with Robert Grant Burns
Whats wrong with that
Burns having sat up until two oclock to finish that particular scenario to his liking plainly resented the expression on Jeans face while she read it
Oh nothing only Im getting awfully sick of these kidnapandrescue and kissinthelastscene pictures and Wild West stuff without a real Western man in the whole thing
Id like to do something real for a change
Robert Grant Burns grunted and reached for his slighted brainchild
What you want
Mother on knitting
Girl washing dishes
Lover arrives they sit on front steps and spoon
Become engaged
Lover hitches up team girl climbs into wagon they drive to town
Ten scenes of driving to town
Lover gets out ties team in front of courthouse
Goes in and gets license
Three scenes of license business
Goes out
Two scenes of driving to minister and hitching team to gate
One scene of getting to door
One scene getting inside the house
One scene preacher calling his wife and hired girl
One scene Do you take this woman one scene I do
Fifteen scenes getting team untied and driving back to ranch
Thats about as much pep as there is in real life in the far West these days
Something like that would suit you maybe
It dont suit the people who pay good nickels and dimes to get a thrill though
Neither does this sort of junk if theyve got any sense
Think of paying nickel after nickel to see Lee Milligan rush to the girls door knock learn the fatal news stagger back and clap his hand to his brow and say Great Heaven
GONE
Jean stirred to combat by the sarcasm of Robert Grant Burns did the stagger and the handtobrow and greatheaven scene with a realism that made Pete Lowry turn his back suddenly
Theyve seen Gil abduct me or Muriel seven times in a perfectly impossible manner and theyoh why dont you give them something REAL
Things that are thrilling and dangerous and terrible do happen out here Mr Burns
Real adventures and real tragedies She stopped and Burns turned his eyes involuntarily toward the kitchen
He had heard all about the history of the Lazy A though he had been very careful to hide the fact that he had heard it
Jeans glance following that of her director was a revealing one
She bit her lip and in a moment she went on with her chin held a shade higher and her pride revolting against subterfuge
I didnt mean that she said quietly
But well up to a certain point I dont mind if you put in real things if it will be good picturestuff
Youre featuring me anyway it seems
Listen
Jeans face changed
Her eyes took that farseeing look of the dreamer
She was looking full at Burns but he knew that she did not see him at all
She was looking at a mental picture of her own conjuring he judged
He stood still and waited curiously wondering to use his manner of speech what the girl was going to spring now
Listen Instead of all this impossible piffle lets start a real story
IIve What kind of a real story
The tone of Robert Grant Burns was carefully noncommittal but his eyes betrayed his eagerness
The girl did have some real ideas sometimes
And Robert Grant Burns was not the one to refuse a real idea because it did not come from his own brain
Well Jean flushed with an adorable shyness at the apparent egotism of her idea since you seem to want me for the central figure in everything suppose we start a story like this Suppose I am left here at the Lazy A with my mother to take care of and a ranch and a lot of cattle and suppose its a hard proposition because theres really a gang of rustlers that have been running off stock and never getting caught and they have a grudge against my family and grab our cattle every chance they get
Supposesuppose they killed my brother when he was about to round them up and they want to drive me and my mother out of the country
Scare us out you know
Well she hesitated and glanced diffidently at the boys who had edged up to listenthat would leave room for all kinds of feature stuff
Say that I have just one or two boys that I can depend on boys that I know are loyal
With an outfit the size of ours that keeps me in the saddle every day and all day and I would have some narrow escapes I reckon
Youve got your rustlers all made to orderonly Id make them up differently if I were doing it
Have them look real you know instead of stagey
Whereat Robert Grant Burns winced
Lee could be one of my loyal cowboys youd want some dramatic acting I reckon and he could do that
But Id want one puncher who can ride and shoot and handle a rope
For that to help me do the real work in the picture I want Lite Avery
There are things I can do that you have never had me do for the simple reason that you dont know the life well enough ever to think of them
Real stunts not these madetoorder shootthevillainandruntothearmsofthehero stuff
Id have to have Lite Avery I wouldnt start without him
Well go on
Robert Grant Burns still tried to sound noncommittal but he was plainly eager to hear all that she had to say
Well thats the idea
Theyre trying to drive us out of the country without really hurting me
And Ive got my mind set on staying
Not only that but I believe they killed my brother and Im going to hunt them down and break up their gang or die in the attempt
Theres your plot
It neednt be overdone in the least to have thrills enough
And there would be all kinds of chance for real rangestuff like the handling of cattle and all that
We can use this ranch just as it is and have the outlaws down next the river
Im glad you havent taken any scenes that show the ranch as a whole
Youve stuck to your closeup greatheaven scenes so much she went on with merciless frankness that youve really not cheapened the place by showing more than a little bit at a time
You might start by making Lee up for my brother and kill him in the first reel show the outlaws when they shoot him and run off with a bunch of stock theyre after
Lite can find him and bring him home
Lite would know just how to do that sort of thing and make people see its real stuff
I believe hed show he was a real cowpuncher even to the people who never saw one
Theres an awful lot of difference between the real thing and your actors
She was so perfectly sincere and so matteroffact that the men she criticised could do no more than grin
You might for the sake of complications put a traitor and spy on the ranch
Oh I tell you
Have Hepsibah be the mother of one of the outlaws
She wouldnt need to do any acting you could show her sneaking out in the dark to meet her son and tell him what she has overheard
And show her listening perhaps through the crack in a door
Mrs
Gay would have to be the mother
Gil says that Hepsibah has the figure of a comedy cook and what he calls a character face
I believe we could manage her all right for what little she would have to do dont you
Jean having poured out her inspiration with a fluency born of her first enthusiasm began to feel that she had been somewhat presumptuous in thus offering advice wholesale to the highest paid director of the Great Western Film Company
She blushed and laughed a little and shrugged her shoulders
Thats just a suggestion she said with forced lightness
Im subject to attacks of acute imagination sometimes
Dont mind me Mr Burns
Your scenario is a very nice scenario Im sure
Do you want me to be a braiddowntheback girl in this
Or a curlsaroundtheface girl
Robert Grant Burns stood absentmindedly tapping his left palm with the folded scenario which Jean had just damned by calling it a very nice scenario
Nice was not the adjective one would apply to it in sincere admiration
Robert Grant Burns himself had mentally called it a hummer
He did not reply to Jeans tentative apology for her own plotidea
He was thinking about the idea itself
Robert Grant Burns was not what one would call petty
He would not for instance stick to his own story if he considered that Jeans was a better one
And after all Jean was now his leading woman and it is not unusual for a leading woman to manufacture her own plots especially when she is being featured by her company
There was no question of hurt pride to be debated within the mind of him therefore
He was just weighing the idea itself for what it was worth
Seems to me your plotidea isnt so much tamer than mine after all
He tested her shrewdly after a prolonged pause
Youve got a killing in the first five hundred feet and outlaws and rustling Oh but dont you see it isnt the skeleton that makes the difference its the kind of meat you put on the bones
Paradise Lost would be a howling melodrama if some of you picturepeople tried to make it
Youd take this plot of mine and make it just like these pictures Ive been working in Mr Burns Exciting and all that but not the real West after all spectacular without being probable
What I meanI cant explain it to you Im afraid but I have it in my head
She looked at him with that lightening of the eyes which was not a smile really but rather the amusement which might grow into laughter later on
Youd better fine me for insubordination she drawled whimsically and tell me whether its to be braids or curls so I can go and make up
At that moment she saw Gil Huntley beckoning to her with a frantic kind of furtiveness that was a fair mixture of pinchedtogether eyebrows and slight jerkings of the head and a guarded movement of his hand that hung at his side
Gil she thought was trying to draw her away before she went too far with her troubleinviting freedom of speech
She laughed lazily
Braids or curls
she insisted
And please sir I wont do so no more honest
Robert Grant Burns looked at her from under his eyebrows and made a sound between his grunt of indignation and his chuckle of amusement
Sure you wont
he queried shortly
Stay the way you are if you want to chances are you wont go to work right away anyhow
Jean flashed him a glance of inquiry
Did that mean that she had at last gone beyond the limit
Was Robert Grant Burns going to FIRE her
She looked at Gil who was sauntering off with the perfectly apparent expectation that she would follow him and Mrs
Gay who was regarding her with a certain melancholy conviction that Jeans time as leading woman was short indeed
She pursed her lips with a rueful resignation and followed Gil to the spring behind the house
Say you mustnt hand out things like that Jean
he protested when they were quite out of sight and hearing of the others
Let me give you a tip girl
If youve got any photoplay ideas that are worth talking about dont go spreading them out like that for Bobby to pick and choose
Pick to pieces you mean Jean corrected
help it hes putting on some awfully stagey plots and they cost just as much to produce as Listen here
Youve got me wrong
That plot of yours could be worked up into a dandy series the idea of a story running through a lot of pictures is great
What I mean is its worth something
You dont have to give stuff like that away make him a present of it you know
I just want to put you wise
If youve got anything thats worth using make em pay for it
Put er into scenario form and sell it to em
Youre in this game to make money so why overlook a bet like that
Oh Gil
Could I
Sure you could
No reason why you shouldnt if you can deliver the goods
Burns has been writing his own plays to fit his company but aside from the features youve been putting into it its old stuff
Hes a darned good director and all that but he hasnt got the knack of building real stories
You see what I mean
If you have why I wonder said Jean with a sudden small doubt of her literary talents if I have
Sure you have
Gils faith in Jean was of the kind that scorns proof
You see youve got the dope on the West and he knows it
Why Ive been watching how he takes the cue from you right along for his features
Ever since you told Lee Milligan how to lay a saddle on the ground Burns has been getting tips and half the time you didnt even know you were giving them
Get into this game right Jean
Make em pay for that kind of thing
Jean regarded him thoughtfully tempted to yield
Mrs
Gay says a hundred dollars a week Its good pay for a beginner
Shes right and shes wrong
Theyre featuring you in stuff that nobody else can do
Who would they put in your place to do the stunts youve been doing
Muriel Gay was a good actress and as good a Western lead as they could produce and you know how she stacked up alongside you
Youre in a class by yourself Jean
You want to keep that in mind
They arent just trying to be nice to you its hardboiled business with the Great Western
Youre going awfully strong with the public
Why my chum writes me that youre announced ahead on the screen at one of the best theaters on Broadway
Coming Jean Douglas in Soandso
Do you know what that means
No you dont of course not
But let me tell you that it means a whole lot
I wish Id had a chance to tip you off to a little business caution before you signed that contract
That salary clause should have been doctored to make a sliding scale of it
As it is youre stuck for a year at a hundred dollars a week unless you spring something the contract does not cover
Dont give away any more dope
Youve got an idea there if Burns will let you work up to it
Make em pay for it
Ohh Gil
came the throaty call of Burns and Gil with a last earnest warning left her hurriedly
Jean sat down on a rock and meditated her chin in her palms and her elbows on her knees
Vague shadows of thoughts clouded her mind and then slowly clarified into definite ideas
Unconsciously she had been growing away from her first formulated plans
She was gradually laying aside the idea of reaching wealth and fame by way of the storytrail
She was almost at the point of admitting to herself that her story as far as she had gone with it could never be taken seriously by any one with any pretense of intelligence
It was too unreal too fantastic
It was almost funny in the most tragic parts
She was ready now to dismiss the book as she had dismissed her earlier ambitions to become a poet
But if she and Lite together could really act a story that had the stamp of realism which she instinctively longed for surely it would be worth while
And if she herself could build the picture story they would later enact before the camerathat would be better much better than writing silly things about an impossible heroine in the hope of later selling the stuff
Automatically her thoughts swung over to the actual building of the scenes that would make for continuity of her latelyconceived plot
Because she knew every turn and every crook of that coulee and every board in the buildings snuggled within it she began to plan her scenes to fit the Lazy A and her action to fit the spirit of the country and those countless small details of life which go to make what we call the local color of the place
There never had been an organized gang of outlaws just here in this part of the country butthere might have been
Her dad could remember when Sid Cummings and his bunch hung out in the Bad Lands fifty miles to the east of there
Neither had she ever had a brother for that matter and of her mother she had no more than the indistinct memory of a time when there had been a long black box in the middle of the livingroom and a lot of people and tears which fell upon her face and tickled her nose when her father held her tightly in his arms
But she had the country and she had Lite Avery and to her it was very very easy to visualize a story that had no foundation in fact
It was what she had done ever since she could rememberthe daydreaming that had protected her from the keen edge of her loneliness
CHAPTER XVIII A NEW KIND OF PICTURE What you doing now
Robert Grant Burns came around the corner of the house looking for her half an hour later and found her sitting on the doorstep with the old atlas on her knees and her hat far back on her head scribbling away for dear life
Jean smiled abstractedly up at him
Why Im whyy Im becoming a famous scenario writer
Do you want me to go and plaster my face with grease paint and become a mere common leading lady again
No I dont
Robert Grant Burns chuckled fatly and held out his hand with a big pink cameo on his little finger
Lets see what a famous scenario looks like
What is itthat plot you were telling me awhile ago
Why yes
Im putting on the meat
There was a slight hesitation before Jean handed him the pages she had done
I expect its awfully crude she apologized with one of her diffident spells
Im afraid youll laugh at me
Robert Grant Burns was reading rapidly mentally photographing the scenes as he went along
He held out his hand again without looking toward her
Lemme take your pencil a minute
I believe Id have a panoram of the couleea long shot from out there in the meadow
And show the brother and you leaving the house and riding toward the camera at the gate you separate
Youre going to town say
He rides on toward the hills
That fixes you both as belonging here at the ranch identifies you two and the home ranch both in thirty feet or so of the film with a leader that tells youre brother and sister
See what I mean
He scribbled a couple of lines crossed out a couple and went on reading to where he had interrupted Jean in the middle of a sentence
I see youre writing in a part for that Lite Avery how do you know hed do it
Or can put it over if he tries
He dont look to me like an actor
Lite declared Jean with a positiveness that would have thrilled Lite had he heard her can put over anything he tries to put over
And hell do it if I tell him he must
Which showed what were Jeans ideas at least on the subject of which was the master
What you going to call it a The Perils of the Prairie say
Burns abandoned further argument on the subject of Lites ability
Oh no
Thats awfully cheap
That would stamp it as a melodrama before any of the picture appeared on the screen
Robert Grant Burns had not been serious he had been testing Jeans originality
Well what will we call it then
Oh well call it Jean nibbled the rubber on her pencil and looked at him with that unseeing introspective gaze which was a trick of hers
Well call itdoes it hurt if we use real names that weve a right to
She got a headshake for answer
Well well call itlets just call itJean of the Lazy A
Would that sound as if Great
Girl youre a winner
Jean of the Lazy A
Say that title alone will jump the releases ten per cent if I know the game
Featuring Jean herself pictures made right at the Lazy A Ranch
Say the dope I can give our publicity man Thereupon Jean remembering Gil Huntleys lecture on the commercial side of the proposition startled his enthusiasm with one naive question
How much will the Great Western Film Company pay me extra for furnishing the story I play in 
How much
Robert Grant Burns blurted the words automatically
Yes
How much
If it will jump your releases ten per cent
they ought to pay me quite a lot more than theyre paying me now
Youre doing pretty well as it is Burns reminded her with a visible dampening of his eagerness
For keeping your cutanddried stories from falling flat yes
But for writing the kind of play that will have just as many punches and still be true to life and then for acting it all out and putting in those punchesthats a different matter Mr Burns
And youll have to pay Lite a decent salary or Ill quit right here
Im thinking up stunts for us two that are awfully risky
Youll have to pay for that
But it will be worth while
You wait till you see Lite in action
Gil would have been exuberant over the literal manner in which Jean was taking his advice and putting it to the test had he overheard her driving her bargain with Robert Grant Burns
He would have been exuberant but he would never have dared to say the things that Jean said or to have taken the stand that she took
Robert Grant Burns found himself very much in the position which Lite had occupied for three years
He had welldefined ideas upon the subject before them and he had the outer semblance of authority but his ideas and his authority had no weight whatever with Jean since she had made up her mind
Before Jean left the subject of salary Robert Grant Burns found himself committed to a promise of an increase provided that Jean really delivered the goods in the shape of a scenario serial and did the stunts which she declared she could and would do
Before she settled down to the actual planning of scenes Robert Grant Burns had also yielded to her demands for Lite Avery though you may think that he thereby showed himself culpably weak unless you realize what sort of a person Jean was in argument
Without having more than a goodmorning acquaintance with Lite Burns agreed to put him on in stock and to pay him the salary Jean demanded for him provided that in the tryout of the first picture Lite should prove he could deliver the goods
Burns was always extremely firm in the matter of having the goods delivered that was why he was the Great Westerns leading director
Mere dollars he would yield if driven into a corner and kept there long enough but he must have results
These things being settled they spent about two hours on the doorstep of Jeans room writing the first reel of the story which is to say that Jean wrote and Burns took each sheet from her hands as it was finished and read and made certain technical revisions now and then
Several times he grunted words of approbation and several times he let his fat black cigar go out while he visualized the scenes which Jeans flying pencil portrayed
Ill go over and get Lite she said at last rubbing the cramp out of her writinghand and easing her shoulders from their strain of stooping
Therell be time while you send the machine after some real hats for your rustlers
Those toadstool things were never seen in this country till you brought them in your trunk and this story is going to be real
Your rustlers wont look much different from the punchers except that theyll be riding different horses well have to get some paint somewhere and make a pinto out of that walleyed cayuse Gil rides mostly
Hell lead the rustlers and you want the audience to be able to spot him a mile off
Lite and I will fix the horse well put spots on him like a horse Uncle Carl used to own
Maybe you cant get Lite Burns pointed out eyeing her over a match blaze
He never acted to me like he had the moviefever at all
Passes us up with a nod and has never showed signs of life on the subject
Lee can ride pretty well he added artfully even if he wasnt born in the saddle
And we can fake that rope work
All right you can send the machine in with a wire to your company for a leading woman
Jean picked up her gloves and turned to pull the door shut behind her and by other signs and tokens made plain her intention to leave
Oh well you can see if hell come
I said Id try him out but Hell come
I told you that before
Jean stopped and looked at her director coldly
And youll keep your word
And we wont have any fake stuff in this except the spots on the pinto
She smiled then
We wouldnt do that but there isnt a pinto in the country right now that would be what we want
You had better get your bunch together because Ill be back in a little while with Lite
As it happened Lite was on his way to the Lazy A and met Jean in the bottom of the sandy hollow
His eyes lightened when he saw her come loping up to him
But when she was close enough to read the expression of his face it was schooled again to the frank friendship which Jean always had accepted as a matter of course
Hello Lite
Ive got a job for you with the movies Jean announced as soon as she was within speaking distance
You can come right back with me and begin
Its going to be great
Were going to make a real Western picture Lite you and I Lee and Gil and all the rest will be in it of course but were going to put in the real West
And were going to put in the ranchthe REAL Lazy A Lite
Not these dinky little sets that Burns has toggled up with bits of the bluff showing for background but the ranch just as itit used to be
Jeans eyes grew wistful while she looked at him and told him her plans
Im writing the scenario myself she explained and thats why you have to be in it
Ive written in stuff that the other boys cant do to save their lives
REAL stuff Lite
You and I are going to run the ranch and punch the cowsLazy A cattle what there are left of themand hunt down a bunch of rustlers that have their hangout somewhere down in the breaks we dont know just where yet
The places well ride theyll need an airship to follow with the camera
I havent got it all planned yet but the first reel is about done were going to begin on it this afternoon
Well need you in the first scenesjust ranch scenes with you and Lee hes my brother and hell get killed Now whats the matter with you
She stopped and eyed him disapprovingly
Why have you got that stubborn look to your mouth
Lite see here
Before you say a word I want to tell you that you are not to refuse this
Itit means money Lite for you and for me too
And that meansdad at home again
Lite Bite looked at her looked away and bit his lips
It was long since he had seen tears in Jeans steady brown eyes and the sight of them hurt him intolerably
There was nothing that he could say to strengthen her faith absolutely nothing
He did not see how money could free her father before his sentence expired
Her faith in her dad seemed to Lite a wonderful thing but he himself could not altogether share it although he had lately come to feel a very definite doubt about Alecks guilt
Money could not help them except that it could buy back the Lazy A and restock it and make of it the home it had been three years ago
Lite in the secret heart of him did not want Jean to set her heart on doing that
Lite was almost in a position to do it himself just as he had planned and schemed and saved to do ever since the day when he took Jean to the Bar Nothing and announced to her that he intended to take care of her in place of her father
He had wanted to surprise Jean and Jean with her usual headlong energy bent upon the same object seemed in a fair way to forestall him unless he moved very quickly
Lite you wont spoil everything now just when Im given this great opportunity will you
Jeans voice was steady again
She could even meet his eyes without flinching
Gil says its a great opportunity in every way
Its a series of pictures really and they are to be called Jean of the Lazy A
Gil says they will be advertised a lot and make me famous
I dont care about that but the company will pay me more and that meansthat means that I can get out and find Art Osgood sooner andget dad home
And you will have to help
The whole thing as I have planned it depends upon you Lite
The riding and the roping and stuff like that youll have to do
Youll have to work right alongside me in all that outdoor stuff because I am going to quit doing all those spectacular stagey stunts and get down to real business
Ive made Burns see that there will be money in it for his company so he is perfectly willing to let me go ahead with it and do it my way
Our way Lite because once you start with it you can help me plan things
Whereupon having said almost everything she could think of that would tend to soften that stubborn look in Lites face Jean waited
Lite did a great deal of thinking in the next two or three minutes but being such a bottledup person he did not say half of what he thought and Jean closely as she watched his face could not read what was in his mind
Of Aleck he thought and the slender chance there was of any one doing what Jean hoped to do of Art Osgood and the meager possibility that Art could shed any light upon the killing of Johnny Croft of the Lazy A and the probable price that Carl would put upon it if he were asked to sell the ranch and the stock of the money he had already saved and the chance that if he went to Carl now and made him an offer Carl would accept
He weighed mentally all the various elements that went to make up the depressing tangle of the whole affair and decided that he would write at once to Rossman the lawyer who had defended Aleck and put the whole thing into his hands
He would then know just where he stood and what he would have to do and what legal steps he must take
He looked at Jean and grinned a little
Im not pretty enough for a picture actor he said whimsically
Better let me be a rustler and wear a mask if you dont want folks to throw fits
Youll be what I want you to be Jean told him with the little smile in her eyes that Lite had learned to love more than he could ever say
Im going to make us both famous Lite
Now come on Bobby Burns has probably chewed up a whole box of those black cigars waiting for us to show up
I am not going to describe the making of Jean of the Lazy A
It would be interesting but this is not primarily a story of the motionpicture business remember
It is the story of the Lazy A and the problem that both Jean and Lite were trying to solve
The Great Western Film Company became through sheer chance a factor in that problem and for that reason we have come into rather close touch with them but aside from the fact that Jeans photoplay brought Lite into the company and later took them both to Los Angeles this particular picture has no great bearing upon the matter
Robert Grant Burns had intended taking his company back to Los Angles in August when the hot winds began to sweep over the range land
But Jeans story was going big
Jean was throwing herself into the part heart and mind
She lived it
With Lite riding beside her helping her with all his skill and energy and much enthusiasm she almost forgot her great undertaking sometimes she was so engrossed with her work
With his experience suggesting frequent changes she added new touches of realism to this story that made the casehardened audience of the Great Westerns private projection room invent new ways of voicing their enthusiasm when the negative films Pete Lowry sent in to headquarters were printed and given their trial run
They were just well started when August came with its hot winds
They stayed and worked upon the serial until it was finished and that meant that they stayed until the first October blizzard caught them while they were finishing the last reel
Do you know what they did then
Jean changed a few scenes around at Lites suggestion and they went out into the hills in the teeth of the storm and pictured Jean lost in the blizzard and coming by chance upon the outlaws at their camp which she and Lite and Lee had been hunting through all the previous installments of the story
It was great stuffthat ride Jean made in the blizzardand that scene where with numbed fingers and snow matted in her dangling braid she held up the rustlers and marched them out of the hills and met Lite coming in search of her
You will remember it if you have been frequenting the silent drama and were fortunate enough to see the picture
You may have wondered at the realism of those blizzard scenes and you may have been curious to know how the camera got the effect
It was wonderful photography of course but then the blizzard was real and that pinched half frozen look on Jeans face in the closeup where she met Lite was real
Jean was so cold when she turned the rustlers over to Lite that when she started to dismount and fell in a heapyou remember
she was not acting at all
Neither was Lite acting when he plunged through the drift and caught Jean in his arms and held her close against him just as that scene ended
In the name of realism they cut the scene because Lite showed that he forgot all about the outlaws and the part he was playing
So they finished the picture and the whole company packed their trunks thankfully and turned their faces and all their thoughts westward
Jean was not at all sure that she wanted to go
It seemed almost as though she were setting aside her great undertaking as though she were weakly deserting her dad when she closed the door for the last time upon her room and turned her back upon Lazy A coulee
But there were certain things which comforted her Lite was going along to look after the horses he told her just the day before they started
For Robert Grant Burns with an eye to the advertising value of the move had decided that Pard must go with them
He would have to hire an express car anyway he said for the automobile and the scenery sets they had used for interiors
And there would be plenty of room for Pard and Lites horse and another which Robert Grant Burns had used to carry him to locations in rough country where the automobile could not go
The car would run in passenger service Burns saidhed fix thatso Lite would be right with the company all the way out
Jean appreciated all that as a personal favor which merely proved how unsophisticated she really was
She did not know that Robert Grant Burns was thinking chiefly of furnishing material for the publicity man to use in news stories
She never once dreamed that the coming of Jean of the Lazy A and Jeans pet horse Pard and of Lite who had done so many surprising things in the picture would be heralded in all the Los Angeles papers before ever they left Montana
Jean was concerned chiefly with attending to certain matters which seemed to her of vital importance
If she must go there was something which she must do first something which for three years she had shrunk from doing
So she told Robert Grant Burns that she would meet him and his company in Helena and without a word of explanation she left two days in advance of them just after she had had another maddening talk with her Uncle Carl wherein she had repeated her intention of employing a lawyer
When she boarded the train at Helena she did not tell even Lite just where she had been or what she had been doing
She did not need to tell Lite
He looked into her face and saw there the shadow of the high stone wall that shut her dad away from the world and he did not ask a single question
CHAPTER XIX IN LOS ANGELES When she felt bewildered Jean had the trick of appearing merely reserved and that is what saved her from the charge of rusticity when Robert Grant Burns led her through the station gateway and into a small reception
No less a man than Dewitt President of the Great Western Film Company clasped her hand and held it while he said how glad he was to welcome her
Jean unawed by his greatness and the honor he was paying her looked up at him with that distracting little beginning of a smile and replied with that evenmore distracting little drawl in her voice and wondered why Mrs
Gay should become so plainly flustered all at once
Dewitt took her by the arm introduced her to a curiouseyed group with a warming cordiality of manner and led her away through a crowd that stared and whispered and up to a great beautiful purple machine with a colored chauffeur in dustcolored uniform
Dewitt was talking easily of trivial things and shooting a question now and then over his shoulder at Robert Grant Burns who had shed much of his importance and seemed indefinably subservient toward Mr Dewitt
Jean turned toward him abruptly
Wheres Lite
Did you send some one to help him with Pard
she asked with real concern in her voice
Those three horses arent used to towns the size of this Mr Burns
Lite is going to have his hands full with Pard
If you will excuse me Mr Dewitt I think Ill go and see how hes making out
Mr Dewitt glanced over her head and met the delighted grin of Jim Gates the publicity manager
The grin said that Jean was running true to form which was a pet simile with Jim Gates and usually accompanied that particular kind of grin
There would be an interesting half column in the next days papers about Jeans arrival and her deep concern for Lite and her wonderful horse Pard but of course she did not know that
Ive got men here to help with the horses Mr Dewitt assured her while he gently urged her into the machine
Theyll be brought right out to the studio
Im taking you home with me in obedience to my wifes orders
She is anxious to meet the young woman who can outride and outshoot any man on the screen and can still be sweet and feminine and lovable
Im quoting my wife you see though I wont say those are not my sentiments also
Your poor wife is going to receive a shock said Jean in an unimpressed tone
But its dear of her to want to meet me
Back of her speech was an irritated impatience that she should be gobbled and carried off like this when she was sure that she ought to be helping Lite get that fool Pard unloaded and safely through the clang and clatter of the downtown district
Robert Grant Burns half facing her on a folding seat sent her a queer puzzled glance from under his eyebrows
Four months had Jean been working under his direction four months had he studied her and still she puzzled him
She was not ignorantthe girl had been out among civilized folks and had learned town ways she was not stupidshe could keep him guessing and he thought he knew all the quirks of human nature too
Then why in the name of common sense did she take Dewitt and his patronage in this matteroffact way as if it were his everyday business to meet strange employees and take them home to his wife
He glanced at Dewitt and caught a twinkle of perfect understanding in the bright blue eyes of his chief
Burns made a sound between a grunt and a chuckle and turned his eyes away immediately but Dewitt chose to make speech upon the subject
You havent spoiled our new leading woman yet he observed idly
Oh but he has Jean dissented
He has got me trained so that when he says smile my mouth stretches itself automatically
When he says sob I sob
He just snaps his fingers Mr Dewitt and I sit up and go through my tricks very nicely
You ought to see how nicely I do them
Mr Dewitt put up a hand and pulled at his close cropped white mustache that could not hide the twitching of his lips
I have seen he said drily and leaned forward for a word with the liveried chauffeur
Turn up on Broadway and stop at the Victoria he said and the chin of the driver dropped an inch to prove he heard
Dewitt laid his fingers on Jeans arm to catch her attention
Do you see that picture on the billboard over there
he asked with a special inflection in his nice crisp voice
Does it look familiar to you
Jean looked and pinched her brows together
Just at first she did not comprehend
There was her name in fancy letters two feet high JEAN OF THE LAZY A
It blared at the passerby but it did not look familiar at all
Beneath was a highcolored poster of a girl on a horse
The horse was standing on its hind feet pawing the air its nostrils flared red its tail swept like a willow plume behind
The machine slowed and stopped for the traffic signal at the crossing and still Jean studied the poster
It certainly did not look in the least familiar
Is that supposed to be me on that plumcolored horse
she drawled when they slid out slowly in the wake of a great truck
Why dont you like it
Dewitt looked at Jim Gates who was again grinning delightedly and surreptitiously scribbling something on the margin of a folded paper he was carrying
Jean turned upon him a mildly resentful glance
No I dont
Pard is not purple hes brown
And hes got the dearest white hoofs and a white sock on his left hind foot and he doesnt snort fire and brimstone either
She glanced anxiously at the jam of wagons and automobiles and clanging streetcars
I dont know though she amended ruefully I think perhaps he will too when he sees all this
I really ought to have stayed with him
You dont think Lite quite capable of taking care of him
Oh yes of course he is
But I just feel that way
Dewitt shifted a little so that he was half facing her and could look at her without having to turn his head
If his eyes told anything of his thoughts the President of the Great Western Film Company was curious to know how she felt about her position and her sudden fame and the work itself
Before they had worked their way into the next block he decided that Jean was not greatly interested in any of these things and he wondered why
The machine slowed swung to the curb and crept forward and stopped in front of the Victoria
Dewitt looked at Burns and Pete Lowry who was on the front seat
I thought youd like to take a glance at the lobby display the Victoria is making he said casually
They are running the Lazy A series you knowto capacity houses too they tell me
Shall we get out
The chauffeur reached back with that gesture of toleration and infinite boredom common to his kind and swung open the door
Robert Grant Burns started up
Come on Jean he said eagerly
I dont suppose that eternal calm of yours will ever show a wrinkle on the surface but lets have a look anyway
Pete Lowry was already out and half way across the pavement
Pete had lain awake in his bed manys the night planning the posing of stills that would show Jean at her best he had visioned them on display in theater lobbies and now he collided with a hurrying shopper in his haste to see the actual fulfillment of those plans
Jean herself was not so eager
She went with the others and she saw herself pictured on Pard on her two feet and sitting upon a rock with her old Stetson tilted over one eye and her hair tousled with the wind
She was loading her sixshooter and talking to Lite who was sitting on his heels with a cigarette in his fingers looking at her with that bottledup look in his eyes
She did not remember when the picture was taken but she liked that best of all
She saw herself leaning out of the window of her room at the Lazy A
She remembered that time
She was talking to Gil outside and Pete had come up and planted his tripod directly in front of her and had commanded her to hold her pose
She did not count them but she had curious impressions of dozens of pictures of herself scattered here and there along the walls of the long coollooking lobby
Every single one of them was marked Jean of the Lazy A
Just that
On a bulletin board in the middle of the entrance just before the marble boxoffice it was lettered again in dignified black type JEAN OF THE LAZY A
Below was one word Today
It looks awfully queer said Jean to Mr Dewitt who wanted to know what she thought of it all they dont explain what its all about or anything
No they dont
Dewitt pulled his mustache and piloted her back to the machine
They dont have to
No echoed Robert Grant Burns with the fat chuckle of utter content in the knowledge of having achieved something
From the looks of things they dont have to
He looked at Jean so intently that she stared back at him wondering what was the matter and when he saw that she was wondering he gave a snort
Good Lord
he said to himself just above a whisper and looked away despairing of ever reading the riddle of Jeans unshakable composure
Was it pose Was the girl phlegmaticwith that face which was so alive with the thoughts that shuttled back and forth behind those steady talking eyes of hers
She was not stupid Robert Grant Burns knew to his own discomfiture that she was not stupid
Nor was she one to pose the absolute sincerity of her terrific frankness was what had worried Robert Grant Burns most
She must know that she had jumped into the front rank of popular actresses and stood out before them allfor the time being at least
Andhe stole a measuring sidelong glance at her just as he had done thousands of times in the past four monthshere she was in the private machine of the President of the Great Western Film Company with that great man himself talking to her as to his honored guest
She had seen herself featured alone at one of the biggest motionpicture theaters in Los Angeles so well known that Jean of the Lazy A was deemed allsufficient as information and advertisement
She had reached what seemed to Robert Grant Burns the final heights
And the girl sat there calm abstracted actually not listening to Dewitt when he talked
She was not even thinking about him
Robert Grant Burns gave her another quick resentful glance and wondered what under heaven the girl WAS thinking about
As a matter of fact having accepted the fact that she seemed to have made a success of her pictures her thoughts had drifted to what seemed to her more vital
Had she done wrong to come away out here away from her problem
The distance worried her
She had not even found out who was the mysterious nightprowler or what he wanted
He had never come again after that night when Hepsy had scared him away
From long thinking about it she had come to a vague general belief that his visits were somehow connected with the murder but in what manner she could not even form a theory
That worried her
She wished now that she had told Lite about it
She was foolish not to have done something instead of sticking her head under the bedclothes and just shivering till he left
Lite would have found out who the man was and what he wanted
Lite would never have let him come and go like that
But the visits had seemed so absolutely without reason
There was nothing to steal and nothing to find
Still she wished she had told Lite and let him find out who it was
Then her talk with the great lawyer had been disquieting
He had not wanted to name his fee for defending her dad but when he had named it it did not seem so enormous as she had imagined it to be
He had asked a great many questions and most of them puzzled Jean
He had said that he would take up the matterby which she believed he meant an investigation of her uncles title to the Lazy A
He said that he would see her father and he told her that he had already been retained to investigate the whole thing so that she need not worry about having to pay him a fee
That he said had already been arranged though he did not feel at liberty to name his client
But he wanted to assure her that everything was being done that could be done
She herself had seen her father
She shrank within herself and tried not to think of that horrible meeting
Her soul writhed under the tormenting memory of how she had seen him
She had not been able to talk to him at all scarcely
The words would not come
She had said that she and Lite were on their way to Los Angeles and would be there all winter
He had patted her shoulder with a tragic apathy in his manner and had said that the change would do her good
And that was all she could remember that they had talked about
And then the guard came and That is what she was thinking about while the big purple machine slid smoothly through the tunnel negotiated a rough stretch where the streetpavers were at work and sped purring out upon the boulevard that stretched away to Hollywood and the hills
That was what she kept hidden behind the eternal calm that so irritated Robert Grant Burns and so delighted Dewitt and so interested Jim Gates who studied her for what copy there was in her personality
It was the same when the next day Dewitt himself took her over to the big plant which he spoke of as the studio
It was immense and yet Jean seemed unimpressed
She was gladder to see Pard and Lite again than she was to meet the sixhundredaweek star whose popularity she seemed in a fair way to outrival
Men and women who were in stock and therefore within the social pale were introduced to her and said nice hackneyed things about how they admired her work and were glad to welcome her
She felt the warm air of goodfellowship that followed her everywhere
All of these people seemed to accept her at once as one of themselves
When she noticed it she was amused at the way the extras stood back and looked at her and whispered together
More than once she overheard what seemed almost to have become a catchphrase out here Jean of the lazy A was the phrase
Jean was not made of wood understand
In a manner she recognized all these little tributes and to a certain degree she appreciated them
She was glad that she had made such a success of it but she was glad because it would help her to take her dad away from that horrible ghastly place and that horrible ghastly death inlife under which he lived
In three years he had grown old and stoopedher dad
And Burns twitted her ironically because she could not simper and lose her head over the attentions these people were loading upon her
Save for the fact that in this way she could earn a good deal of money and could pay that lawyer Rossman and trace Art Osgood she would not have stayed she could not have endured the staying
For the easier they made life for her the greater contrast did they make between her and her dad
Gil brought her a great bunch of roses unbelievably beautiful and fragrant and laughed and told her they didnt look much like those snowdrifts she waded through the last day they worked on the Lazy A serial
For just a minute he thought Jean was going to throw them at him and he worried himself into sleeplessness poor boy wondering how he had offended her and how he could make amends
Could he have looked into Jeans soul he would have seen that it was seared with the fresh memory of iron bars and high walls and her dad who never saw any roses and that the contrast between their beauty and the terrible barrenness that surrounded him was like a blow in her face
Dewitt himself sensed that something was wrong with her
She was not her natural self and he knew it though his acquaintance with her was a matter of hours only
Part of his business it was to study people to read them he read Jean now in a general way
Not being a clairvoyant he of course had no inkling of the very real troubles that filled her mind though the effect of those troubles he saw quite plainly
He watched her quietly for a day and then he applied the best remedy he knew
Youve just finished a long hard piece of work he said in his crisp matteroffact way on the second morning after her arrival
There is going to be a delay here while we shape things up for the winter and it is my custom to keep my people in the very best condition to work right up to the standard
So you are all going to have a twoweeks vacation JeanoftheLazy A
At full salary of course and to put you yourself into the true holiday spirit Im going to raise your salary to a hundred and seventyfive a week
I consider you worth it he added with a quieting gesture of uplifted hand or you may be sure I wouldnt pay it
Get some nice old lady to chaperone you and go and play
The ocean is good get somewhere on the beach
Or go to Catalina and play there
Or stay here and go to the movies
Go and see Jean of the Lazy A and watch how the audience lives with her on the screen
Go up and talk to the wife
She told me to bring you up for dinner
You go climb into my machine and tell Bob to take you to the house now
Run along Jean of the Lazy A
This is an order from your chief
Jean wanted to cry
She held the roses that she almost hated for their very beauty and fragrance close pressed in her arms while she went away toward the machine
Dewitt looked after her thought she meant to obey him and turned to greet a great man of the town who had been waiting for five minutes to speak to him
Jean did not climb into the purple car and tell Bob to drive her to the house
She walked past it without even noticing that it stood there an aristocrat among the other machines parked behind the great studio that looked like a long low warehouse
She knew the straightest shortest trail to the corrals you may be sure of that
She took that trail
Pard was standing in a far corner under a shed switching his tail methodically at the October crop of flies
His head lay over the neck of a scrawny little buckskin for which he had formed a sudden and violent attachment and his eyes were half closed while he drowsed in lazy content
Pard was not worrying about anything
He looked so luxuriously happy that Jean had not the heart to disturb him even with her comfort seeking caresses
She leaned her elbows on the corral gate and watched him awhile
She asked a bashful gumchewing youth if he could tell her where to find Lite Avery
But the youth seemed never to have heard of Lite Avery and Jean was too miserable to explain and describe Lite and insist upon seeing him
She walked over to the nearest carline and caught the next street car for the city
Part of her chiefs orders at least she would obey
She would go down to the Victoria and see Jean of the Lazy A but she was not going because of any impulse of vanity or to soothe her soul with the applause of strangers
She wanted to see the ranch again
She wanted to see the dear familiar line of the old bluff that framed the coulee and ride again with Lite through those wild places they had chosen for the pictures
She wanted to lose herself for a little while among the hills that were home
CHAPTER XX CHANCE TAKES A HAND A huge pipe organ was filling the theater with a vast undertone that was like the whispering surge of a great wind
Jean went into the soft twilight and sat down feeling that she had shut herself away from the harsh horrible world that held so much of suffering
She sighed and leaned her head back against the curtained enclosure of the loges and closed her eyes and listened to the big sweeping harmonies that were yet so subdued
Down next the river in a sheltered little coulee there was a group of great bull pines
Sometimes she had gone there and leaned against a tree trunk and had shut her eyes and listened to the vast symphony which the wind and the water played together
She forgot that she had come to see a picture which she had helped to create
She held her eyes shut and listened and that horror of high walls and iron bars that had haunted her for days and the aged broken man who was her father dimmed and faded and was temporarily erased the lightness of her lips eased a little the tenseness relaxed from her face as it does from one who sleeps
But the music changed and her mood changed with it
She did not know that this was because the story pictured upon the screen had changed but she sat up straight and opened her eyes and felt almost as though she had just awakened from a vivid dream
A Mexican series of educational pictures were being shown
Jean looked and leaned forward with a little gasp
But even as she fixed her eyes and startled attention upon it that scene was gone and she was reading mechanically of refugees fleeing to the border line
She must have been asleep she told herself and had gotten things mixed up in her dreams
She shook herself mentally and remembered that she ought to take off her hat and she tried to fix her mind upon the pictures
Perhaps she had been mistaken perhaps she had not seen what she believed she had seen
But what if it were true
What if she had really seen and not imagined it
It couldnt be true she kept telling herself of course it couldnt be true
Still her mind clung to that instant when she had first opened her eyes and very little of what she saw afterwards reached her brain at all
Then she had for the first time in her life the strange experience of seeing herself as others saw her
The screen announcement and expectant stir that greeted it caught her attention and pulled her back from the whirl of conjecture into which she had been plunged
She watched and she saw herself ride up to the foreground on Pard
She saw herself look straight out at the audience with that peculiar little easing of the lips and the lightening of the eyes which was just the infectious beginning of a smile
Involuntarily she smiled back at her pictured self just as every one else was smiling back
For that you must know was what had first endeared her so to the public the human quality that compelled instinctive response from those who looked at her
So Jean in the loge smiled at Jean on the screen
Then Litedear silent longlegged Litecame loping up and pushed back his hat with the gesture that she knew so well and spoke to her and smiled and a lump filled the throat of Jean in the loge though she could not have told why
Then Jean on the screen turned and went riding with Lite back down the trail with her hat tilted over one eye because of the sun and with one foot swinging free of the stirrup in that absolute unconsciousness of pose that had first caught the attention of Robert Grant Burns and his camera man
Jean in the loge heard the ripple of applause among the audience and responded to it with a perfectly human thrill
Presently she was back at the Lazy A living again the scenes which she herself had created
This was the fourth or fifth pictureshe did not at the moment remember just which
At any rate it had in it that incident when she had first met the picturepeople in the hills and mistaken Gil Huntley and the other boys for real rustlers stealing her uncles cattle
You will remember that Robert Grant Burns had told Pete to take all of that encounter and he had later told Jean to write her scenario so as to include that incident
Jean blushed when she saw herself ride up to those three and throw down on them with her gun
She had been terribly chagrined over that performance
But now it looked awfully real she told herself with a little glow of pride
Poor old Gil
They hadnt caught her roping him anyway and she was glad of that
He would have looked absurd and those people would have laughed at him
She watched how she had driven the cattle back up the coulee with little rushes up the bank to head off an unruly cow that had ideas of her own about the direction in which she would travel
She loved Pard for the way he tossed his head and whirled the cricket in his bit with his tongue and obeyed the slightest touch on the rein
The audience applauded that cattle drive and Jean was almost betrayed into applauding it herself
Later there was a scene where she had helped Lite Avery and Lee Milligan round up a bunch of cattle and cut out three or four which were to be sold to a butcher for money to take her mother to the doctor
Lite rode close to the camera and looked straight at her and Jean bit her lips sharply as tears stung her lashes for some inexplicable reason
Dear old Lite
Every line in his face she knew every varying vagrant expression every little twitch of his lips and eyelids that meant so much to those who knew him well enough to read his face
Jeans eyes softened cleared and while she looked her lips parted a little and she did not know that she was smiling
She was thinking of the day not long ago when she had seen a bird fly into the loft over the storehouse and she had climbed in a spirit of idle curiosity to see what the bird wanted there
She had found Lites bed neatly smoothed for the day the pillow placed so that lying there he could look out through the opening and see the house and the path that led to it
There was the faint aroma of tobacco about the place
Jean had known at once just why that bed was there and almost she knew how long it had been there
She had never once hinted that she knew and Lite would never tell her by look or word that he was watching her welfare
Here came Gil dashing up to the brow of the hill dismounting and creeping behind a rock that he might watch them working with the cattle in the valley below
Jean met his pictured approach with a little smile of welcome
That was the scene where she told him he got off the horse like a sack of oats and had shown him how to swing down lightly and with a perfect balance instead of coming to the earth with a thud of his feet
Gil had taken it all in good faith the camera proved now how well he had followed her instructions
And afterwards while the assistant cameraman with whom Jean never had felt acquainted shouldered the camera and tripod and they all tramped down the hill to another location there had been a little scene in the shade of that rock between Jean and the star villain
She blushed a little and wondered if Gil remembered that tentative lovemaking scene which Burns had unconsciously cut short with a bellowing order to rehearse the next scene
It was wonderful it was fascinating to sit there and see those days of hard absorbing work relived in the story she had created
Jean lost herself in watching how Jean of the Lazy A came and went and lived her life bravely in the midst of so much that was hard
Jean in the loge remembered how Burns had yelled Smile when you come up look lighthearted
And then let your face change gradually while you listen to your mother crying in there
Therell be a cutback to show her down on her knees crying before Bobs chair
Let that tired worried look come into your facethe loads dropping on to your shoulders againthat kind of dope
Get me
Jean in the loge remembered how she had been told to do this deliberately just out of her imagination
And then she saw how Jean on the screen came whistling up to the house swinging her quirt by its loop and with a spring in her walk and making you feel that it was a beautiful day and that all the meadow larks were singing and that she had just had a gallop on Pard that made her forget that she ever looked trouble in the face
Then Jean in the loge looked and saw screenJeans mother kneeling before Bobs chair and sobbing so that her shoulders shook
She looked and saw screen Jean stop whistling and swinging her quirt saw her stand still in the path and listen saw the smile fade out of her eyes
Jean in the loge thought suddenly of that moment when she had looked at dad coming in where she waited and swallowed a lump in her throat
A woman near her gave a little stifled sob of sympathy when screenJean turned and went softly around the corner of the house with all the light gone from her face and all the spring gone out of her walk
Jean in the loge gave a sigh of relaxed tension and looked around her
The seats were nearly all full and every one was gazing fixedly forward lost in the pictured story of Jean on the screen
So that was what all those madetoorder smiles and frowns meant
Jean had done them at Burns command because she had seen that the others simulated different emotions whenever he told them to
She knew furthermore that she had done them remarkably well so well that people responded to every emotion she presented to them
She was surprised at the vividness of every one of those cut anddried scenes
They imposed upon her even after all the work and fussing she had gone through to get them to Burns liking
And there in the cool gloom of the Victoria Jean for the first time realized to the full the true ability of Robert Grant Burns
For the first time she really appreciated him and respected him and was grateful to him for what he had taught her to do
Her mood changed abruptly when the Jean picture ended
The music changed to the strain that had filled the great place when she entered nearly an hour before
Jean sat up straight again and waited alert impatient anxious to miss no smallest part of that picture which had startled her so when she had first looked at the screen
If the thing was true which she half believedif it were true
So she stared with narrowed lids intent watchful her whole mind concentrated upon what she should presently see
Warring Mexico
That was the name of it a Lubin special release of the kind technically called educational
Jean held her breath waiting for the scene that might mean so much to her
There this must be it she thought with a flush of inner excitement
This surely must be the one NOGALES MEXICO
FEDERAL TROOPS OF GENERAL KOSTERLISKY WITH AMERICAN SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE SERVING ON STAFF OF NOTED GENERAL
Jean had it stamped indelibly upon her brain
She waited with a quick intake of breath when the picture stood out with a sudden clarity before her eyes
A closeup group of officers and menand some of the men Americans in face dress and manner
But it was one man and one only at whom she looked
Tall he was and squareshouldered and lean with his hat set far back on his head and a half smile curling his lips and his eyes looking straight into the camera
Standing there with his weight all on one foot in that attitude which cowboys call hipshot
Art Osgood
She was sure of it
Her hands clenched in her lap
Art Osgood at Nogales Mexico
Serving on the staff of General Kosterlisky
Was the man mad to stand there publicly before the merciless revealing eye of a motionpicture camera
Or did his vanity blind him to the risk he was taking
The man at whom she sat glaring glanced sidewise at some person unseen and Jean knew that glance that turn of the head
He smiled anew and lifted his Americanmade Stetson a few inches above his head and held it so in salute
Just so had he lifted and held his hat high one day when she had turned and ridden away from him down the trail
Jean caught herself just as her lips opened to call out to him in recognition and sharp reproach
He turned and walked away to where the troopers were massed in the background
It was thus that she had first glimpsed him for one instant before the scene ended it was just as he turned his face away that she had opened her eyes and thought it was Art Osgood who was walking away from the camera
She waited a minute staring abstractedly at the refugees who were presented next
She wished that she knew when the picture had been takenhow long ago
Her experience with motionpicture making her listening to the shoptalk of the company had taught her much she knew that sometimes weeks elapse between the cameras work and the actual projection of a picture upon the theater screens
Still this was in a sense a news release and therefore in all probability hurried to the public
Art Osgood might still be at Nogales Mexico wherever that was
He might and Jean made up her mind and laid her plans while she sat there pinning on her hat
She got up quietly and slipped out
She was going to Nogales Mexico wherever that was
She was going to get Art Osgood and she didnt care whether she had to fight her way clear through Warring Mexico
She would find him and get him and bring him back
In the lobby while she paused with a truly feminine instinct to tip her hat this way and that before the mirror and give her hair a tentative pat or two at the back the grinning face of Lite Avery in his gray Stetson appeared like an apparition before her eyes
She turned quickly
Why Lite
she said a little startled
Why Jean
he mimicked in the bantering voice that was like home to her
Dont rush off havent seen you today
Wait till I get you a ticket and then you come back and help me admire ourselves
I came down on a long lope when somebody said you caught a street car headed this way
Thought maybe Id run across you here
Knew you couldnt stay away much longer from seeing how you look
Aint too proud to sit alongside a roughneck puncher are you
Jean looked at him understandingly
Lites exuberance was unusual but she knew as well as though he had told her that he had been lonesome in this strange city and that he was overjoyed at the sight of her who was his friend
She unpinned her hat which she had been at some pains to adjust at the exact angle decreed by fashion
Yes Ill go back with you she drawled
I want to see how you like the sight of yourself just as you are
Itits good for one after the first shock wears off
She would not say a word about that Mexican picture she thought but she wanted to see if Lite also would recognize Art Osgood and feel as sure of his identity as she had felt
That would make her doubly sure of her self
She could do what she meant to do without any misgivings whatsoever
She could afford to wait a little while and have the pleasure of Lites presence beside her
Lite was homesick and lonesomeshe felt it in every tone and in every lookalmost as homesick and lonesome as she was herself
She would not hurt him by going off and leaving him alone even if she had not wanted to be with him and to watch the effect that Mexican picture would have upon him
Lite believed Art Osgood was in the Klondyke
She would wait and see what he believed after he had seen that Nogales picture She waited
She had missed Lite in the last day or so she had seemed almost as far away from him as from the Lazy A
But all the while she talked to him in whispers when he had wanted to discuss the Jean picture she was waiting just waiting for that Nogales picture
When it came at last Jean turned her head and watched Lite
And Lite gave a real start and said something under his breath and plucked at her sleeve afterwards to attract her attention
Lookquick
That fellow standing there with his arms folded
Skin me alive if it isnt Art Osgood
Are you sure
Jean studied him
Sure
Wherere your eyes
Look at him
It sure aint anybody else Jean
Now what do you reckon hes doing down in Mexico
CHAPTER XXI JEAN BELIEVES THAT SHE TAKES MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS After all Jean did not have to fight her way clear through Warring Mexico and back again in order to reach Nogales
She let Lite take her to the snug little apartment which she was to share with Muriel and her mother and she fancied that she had been very crafty and very natural in her manner all the while he was with her and that Lite did not dream of what she had in her mind to do
At any rate she watched him stalk away on his highheeled ridingboots and she thought that his mind was perfectly at ease
Jean I fear never will understand Lite half as well as Lite has always understood Jean
She caught the next downtown car and went straight to the information bureau of the Southern Pacific established for the convenience of the public and the sanity of employees who have something to do besides answer foolish questions
She found a young man there who was not averse to talking at length with a young woman who was dressed trimly in a street suit of the latest fashion and who had almost entrancing soft drawl to her voice and a most fascinating way of looking at one
This young man appeared to know a great deal and to be almost eager to pass along his wisdom
He knew all about Nogales Mexico for instance and just what train would next depart in that general direction and how much it would cost and how long she would have to wait in Tucson for the onceaday train to Nogales and when she might logically expect to arrive in that squatty little town that might be said to be really and truly divided against itself
Here the nice young man became facetious
Bible tells us a city divided against itself cannot stand he informed Jean quite gratuitously
Well maybe thats straight goods too
But Nogales is cut right through at the waist line with the international boundary line
United States customhouse on one corner of the street Mexican customhouse in talking distance on the other corner
Great place for holdups that
This was a joke and Jean smiled obligingly
First the United States holds you up and then the Mexicans
You get it coming and going
Well Nogales dont have to stand
It squats
Its adobe mostly
Jean was interested and she did not discourage the nice young man
She let him say all he could think of on the subject of Nogales and the Federal troops stationed there and on warring Mexico generally
When she left him she felt as if she knew a great deal about the end of her journey
So she smiled and thanked the nice young man in that soft drawl that lingered pleasantly in his memory and went over to another window and bought a ticket to Nogales
She moved farther along to another window and secured a Pullman ticket which gave her lower five in car four for her comfort
With an impulse of wanting to let her Uncle Carl know that she was not forgetting her mission she sent him this laconic telegram Have located Art
Will bring him back with me
JEAN
After that she went home and packed a suitcase and her sixshooter and belt
She did not after all know just what might happen in Nogales Mexico but she meant to bring back Art Osgood if he were to be found alive hence the sixshooter
That evening she told Muriel that she was going to run away and have her vacationher vacation hunting down and capturing a murderer who had taken refuge in the Mexican armyand that she would write when she knew just where she would stop
Then she went away alone in a taxi to the depot and started on her journey with a sixshooter jostling a box of chocolates in her suitcase and with her heart almost light again now that she was at last following a clue that promised something at the other end
It was all just as the nice young man had told her
Jean arrived in Tucson and she left on time on the onceaday train to Nogales
Lite also arrived in Tucson on time though Jean did not see him since he descended from the chair car with some caution just as she went into the depot
He did not depart on time as it happened he was thirsty and he went off to find something wetter than water to drink and while he was gone the onceaday train also went off through the desert
Lite saw the last pair of wheels it owned go clipping over the switch and he stood in the middle of the track and swore
Then he went to the telegraph office and found out that a freight left for Nogales in ten minutes
He hunted up the conductor and did things to his bank roll and afterwards climbed into the caboose on the sidetrack
Lite has been so careful to keep in the background through all these chapters that it seems a shame to tell on him now
But I am going to say that little as Jean suspected it he had been quite as interested in finding Art Osgood as had she herself
When he saw her pass through the gate to the train in Los Angeles that was his first intimation that she was going to Nogales so he had stayed in the chair car out of sight
But it just shows how great minds run in the same channel and how without suspecting one another these two started at the same time upon the same quest
Jean stared out over the barrenness that was not like the barrenness of Montana and tried not to think that perhaps Art Osgood had by this time drifted on into obscurity
Still if he had drifted on surely she could trace him since he had been serving on the staff of a general and should therefore be pretty well known
What she really hated most to think of was the possibility that he might have been killed
They did get killed sometimes down there where there was so much fighting going on all the time
When the shadows of the giant cactus stretched mutilated hands across the desert sand and she believed that Nogales was near Jean carried her suitcase to the cramped dressingroom and took out her sixshooter and buckled it around her
Then she pulled her coat down over it with a good deal of twisting and turning before the dirty mirror to see that it looked all right and not in the least as though a perfect lady was packing a gun
She went back and dipped fastidious fingers into the box of chocolates and settled herself to nibble candy and wait for what might come
She felt very calm and self possessed and sure of herself
Her only fear was that Art Osgood might have been killed and his lips closed for all time
So they rattled away through the barrenness and drew near to Nogales
Casa del Sonora whither she went was an old two story structure of the truly Spanish type and it was kept by a huge blubbery creature with piggish eyes and a bloated purple countenance and the palsy
As much of him as appeared to be human appeared to be Irish and Jean after the first qualm of repulsion when she faced him over the hotel register detected a certain kindly solicitude in his manner and was reassured
So far everything had run smoothly like a well staged play
Absurdly simple utterly devoid of any element of danger any vexatious obstacle to the immediate achievement of her purpose
But Jean was not thrown off her guard because of the smoothness of the trail
The trip from Tucson had been terribly tiresome she was weary in every fibre it seemed to her
But for all that she intended sometime that evening to meet Art Osgood if he were in town
She intended to take him with her on the train that left the next morning
She thought it would be a good idea to rest now and to proceed deliberately lest she frustrate all her plans by overeagerness
Perhaps she slept a little while she lay upon the bed and schooled herself to calmness
A band somewhere playing a pulsing Spanish air brought her to her feet
She went to the window and looked out and saw that the street lay cool and sunless with the coming of dusk
From the American customhouse just on the opposite corner came Lite Avery stalking leisurely along in his highheeled ridingboots
Jean drew back with a little flutter of the pulse and watched him wondering how he came to be in Nogales
She had last seen him boarding a car that would take him out to the Great Western Studio and now here he was sauntering across the street as if he lived here
It was like finding his bed up in the loft and knowing all at once that he had been keeping watch all the while thinking of her welfare and never giving her the least hint of it
That at least was understandable
But to her there was something uncanny about his being here in Nogales
When he was gone she stepped out through the open window to the veranda that ran the whole length of the hotel and looked across the street into Mexico
She was she decided critically about fifteen feet from the boundary line
Just across the street fluttered the Mexican flag from the Mexican customhouse
A Mexican guard lounged against the wall his swarthy face masklike in its calm
While she leaned over the railing and stared curiously at that part of the street which was another country from the hills away to the west where were camped soldiersthe American soldierswho prevented the war from slopping over the line now and then into Arizona came the clear notes of a bugle held closepressed against the lips of a United States soldier in snugfitting khaki
The boom of the sundown salute followed immediately after
In the street below her Mexicans and Americans mingled amiably and sauntered here and there killing time during that bored interval between eating and the evenings amusement
Just beyond the Mexican boundary the door of a long adobe cantina was flung open and a group of men came out and paused as if they were wondering what they should do next and where they should go
Jean looked them over curiously
Mexicans they were not though they had some of the dress which belonged on that side of the boundary
Americans they were one knew by the set of their shoulders by the little traits of race which have nothing to do with complexion or speech
Jean caught her breath and leaned forward
There was Art Osgood standing with his back toward her and with one palm spread upon his hip in the attitude she knew so well
If only he would turn
Should she run down the stairs and go over there and march him across the line at the muzzle of her revolver
The idea repelled her now that she had actually come to the point of action
Jean now that the crisis had arrived used her womans wile rather than the harsher but perhaps less effective weapons of a man
Oh Art
she called just exactly as she would have called to him on the range in Montana Hello Art
Art Osgood wheeled and sent a startled seeking glance up at the veranda saw her and knew who it was that had called him and lifted his hat in the gesture that she knew so well
Jeans fingers were close to her gun though she was not conscious of it or of the strained tense muscles that waited the next move
Art contrary to her expectations did the most natural thing in the world
He grinned and came hurrying toward her with the long eager steps of one who goes to greet a friend after an absence that makes of that meeting an event
Jean watched him cross the street
She waited dazed by the instant success of her ruse while he disappeared under the veranda
She heard his feet upon the stairs
She heard him come striding down the hall to the glasspaneled door
She saw him coming toward her still grinning in his joy at the meeting
Jean Douglas
By all thats lucky
he was exclaiming
Where in the world did you light down from
He came to a stop directly in front of her and held out his hand in unsuspecting friendship
CHAPTER XXII JEAN MEETS ONE CRISIS AND CONFRONTS ANOTHER Well say
This is like seeing you walk out of that picture thats running at the Teatro Palacia
You sure are making a hit with those moving pictures made me feel like Id met somebody from home to stroll in there and see you and Lite come riding up large as life
How is Lite anyway
If Art Osgood felt any embarrassment over meeting her he certainly gave no sign of it
He sat down on the railing pushed back his hat and looked as though he was preparing for a real soulfeast of reminiscent gossip
Just get in
he asked by way of opening wider the channel of talk
He lighted a cigarette and flipped the match down into the street
Ive been here three or four months
Im part of the Mexican revolution though I dont reckon I look it
We been keeping things pretty well stirred up down this way
You looking for picture dope
Lubin folks are copping all kinds of good stuff here
You aint with them are you
Jean braced herself against slipping into easy conver sation with this man who seemed so friendly and unsuspicious and so consciencefree
Killing a man she thought evidently did not seem to him a matter of any moment perhaps because he had since then become a professional killer of men
After planning exactly how she should meet any contingency that might arise she found herself baffled
She had not expected to meet this attitude
She was not prepared to meet it
She had taken it for granted that Art Osgood would shun a meeting that she would have to force him to face her
And here he was sitting on the porch rail and swinging one spurred and booted foot smiling at her and talking in high spirits over the meetingor a genius at acting
She eyed him uncertainly trying to adjust herself to this emergency
Art came to a pause and looked at her inquiringly
Whats the matter
he demanded
You called me up hereand I sure was tickled to death to come all rightand now you stand there looking like I was a kid that had been caught whispering and must be kept after school
I know the symptoms believe me
Youre sore about something Ive said
What dont you like to have anybody talk about you being a movie queen
You sure are all of that
Youve got a license to be proud of yourself
Or maybe you didnt know you was speaking to a Mexican soldier or something like that
He made a move to rise
Excuse ME if Ive said something I hadnt ought
Ill beat it while the beatings good
No you wont
Youll stay right where you are
His frank acceptance of her hostile attitude steadied Jean
Do you think I came all the way down here just to say hello
Search me
Art studied her curiously
I never could keep track of what you thought and what you meant and I guess you havent grown any easier to read since I saw you last
Ill be darned if I know what you came for but its a cinch you didnt come just to be riding on the cars
No drawled Jean watching him
I didnt
I came after you
Art Osgood stared while his cheeks darkened with the flush of confusion
He laughed a little
I sure wish that was the truth he said
Jean you never would have to go very far after any man with two eyes in his head
Dont rub it in
I did said Jean calmly
I came after you
Id have found you if I had to hunt all through Mexico and fight both armies for you
Jean
There was a queer pleading note in Arts voice
I wish I could believe that but I cant
I aint a fool
Yes you are
Jean contradicted him pitilessly
You were a fool when you thought you could go away and no one think you knew anything at all about Johnny Croft
Arts fingers had been picking at a loose splinter on the wooden rail whereon he sat
He looked down at it jerked it loose with a sharp twist and began snapping off little bits with his thumb and forefinger
In a minute he looked up at Jean and his eyes were different
They were not hostile they were merely cold and watchful and questioning Well
Well somebody did think so
Ive thought so for three years and so Im here
Jean found that her breath was coming fast and that as she leaned back against a post and gripped the rail on either side her arms were quivering like the legs of a frightened horse
Still her voice had sounded calm enough
Art Osgood sat with his shoulders drooped forward a little and painstakingly snipped off tiny bits of the splinter
After a short silence he turned his head and looked at her again
I shouldnt think youd want to stir up that trouble after all this while he said
But women are queer
I cant see myself why youd want to bother hunting me up on account ofthat
Jean weighed his words his look his manner and got no clue at all to what was going on back of his eyes
On the surface he was just a tanned fairly goodlooking young man who has been reluctantly drawn into an unpleasant subject
Well I did consider it worth while bothering to hunt you up she told him flatly
If you dont think its important you at least wont object to going back with me
Again his glance went to her face plainly startled
Go back with you
he repeated
What for
Well Jean still had some trouble with her breath and to keep her quiet smooth drawl lets make it a womans reason
Because
Arts face settled to a certain hardness that still was not hostile
Becauses dont go he said
Not with a girl like you they might with some
What do you want me to go back for
Well I want you to go because I want to clear things up about Johnny Croft
Its timeit was cleared up
Art regarded her fixedly
Well I dont see yet whats back of that first BECAUSE he sparred
Theres nothing I can do to clear up anything
Art dont lie to me about it
I know What do you know
Arts eyes never left her face now
They seemed to be boring into her brain
Jean began to feel a certain confusion
To be sure she had never had any experience whatever with fugitive murderers but no one would ever expect one to act like this
A little more she thought resentfully and he would be making her feel as if she were the guilty person
She straightened herself and stared back at him
I know you left because youyou didnt want to stay and facethings
II have felt as if I could kill you almost for what you have done
II dont see how you can SIT there andand look at me that way
She stopped and braced herself
I dont want to argue about it
I came here to make you go back and face things
Itshorrible She was thinking of her father then and she could not go on
Jean youre all wrong
I dont know what idea youve got but you may as well get one or two things straight
Maybe you do feel like killing me but I dont know what for
I havent the slightest notion of going back theres nothing I could clear up if I did go
Jean looked at him dumbly
She supposed she should have to force him to go after all
Of course you couldnt expect that a man who had committed a crime will admit it to the first questioner you couldnt expect him to go back willingly and face the penalty
She would have to use her gun perhaps even call on Lite since Lite had followed her
She might have felt easier in her mind had she seen how Lite was standing just within the glasspaneled door behind the dimity curtain listening to every word and watching every expression on Art Osgoods face
Lites hand also was close to his gun to be perfectly sure of Jeans safety
But he had no intention of spoiling her feeling of independence if he could help it
He had lots of faith in Jean
What has cropped up anyway
Art asked her curiously as if he had been puzzling over her reasons for being there
I thought that affair was settled long ago when it happened
I thought it was all straight sailing To send an innocent man to prison for it
Do you call that straight sailing
Jeans eyes had in them now a flash of anger that steadied her
What innocent man
Art threw away the stub of the splinter and sat up straight
I never knew any innocent man Oh
You didnt know
All I know said Art with a certain swiftness of speech that was a new element in his manner Im dead willing to tell you
I knew Johnny had been around knocking the outfit and making some threats and saying things he had no business to say
I never did have any use for him just because he was so mouthy
I wasnt surprised to hearhow it ended up
To hear
You werent there when it happened
Jean was watching him for some betraying emotion some sign that she had struck home
She got a quick sharp glance from him as if he were trying to guess just how much she knew
Why should I have been there
The last time I was ever at the Lazy A he stated distinctly was the day before I left
I didnt go any farther than the gate then
I had a letter for your father and I met him at the gate and gave it to him
A letter for dad
It was not much but it was better than nothing
Jean thought she might lead him on to something more
Yes
A note or a letter
Carl sent me over with it
Carl
What was it about
I never heard I never read it
Ask your dad what it was about why dont you
I dont reckon it was anything particular
Maybe it was though
Jean was turning crafty
She would pretend to be interested in the letter and trip Art somehow when he was off his guard
Are you sure that it was the day beforeyou left
Yes
Some high talk in the street caught his attention and Art turned and looked down
Jean caught at the chance to study his averted face but she could not read innocence or guilt there
Art she decided was not as transparent as she had always believed him to be
He turned back and met her look
I know it was the day before
Why
Oh I wondered
Dad didnt say What did he do with itthe letter
He opened it and read it
A smile of amused understanding of her finesse curled Arts lips
And he stuck it in the pocket of his chaps and went on to wherever he was going
His eyes challenged her impishly
And it was from Uncle Carl you say
Art hesitated and the smile left his lips
Itit was from Carl yes
Why
Oh I just wondered
Jean was wondering why he had stopped smiling all at once and why he hesitated
Was he afraid he was going to contradict himself about the day or the errand
Or was he afraid she would ask her Uncle Carl and find that there was no letter
Why dont you ask your dad if you are so anxious to know all about it
Art demanded abruptly
Anyway thats the last time I was ever over there
Ask dad
Jeans anger flamed out suddenly
Art Osgood when I think of dad I wonder why I dont shoot you
I wonder how you dare sit there and look me in the face
Ask dad
Dad who is paying with his life and all thats worth while in life for that murder that you deny Whats that
Paying how
Art leaned toward her and now his face was hard and hostile and so were his eyes
Paying
You know how he is paying
Paying in Deer Lodge penitentiary Who
YOUR FATHER
Had Art been ready to spring at her and catch her by the throat he would not have looked much different
My father
Jeans voice broke upon the word
And you She did not attempt to finish the charge
Art sat looking at her with a queer intensity
Your father
he repeated
Aleck
I never knew that Jean
Take my word I never knew that
He seemed to be thinking pretty fast
Wheres Carl at
he asked irrelevantly
Uncle Carl
Hes home running both ranches
I I never could make Uncle Carl see that you must have been the one
Been the one that shot Crofty you mean
Art gave a short laugh
He got up and stood in front of her
Thanks awfully
Good reason why he couldnt see it
He knows well enough I didnt do it
He knowswho did
He bit his lips then as if he feared that he had said too much
Uncle Carl knows
Then why doesnt he tell
It wasnt dad
Jean took a defiant step toward him
Art Osgood if you dare say it was dad IIll kill you
Art smiled at her with a brief lightening of his eyes
I believe you would at that he said soberly
But it wasnt your dad Jean
Who was it
Idontknow
You do
You do know Art Osgood
And you ran off and they gave dad eight years Art spoke one word under his breath and that word was profane
I dont see how that could be he said after a minute
Jean did not answer
She was biting her lips to keep back the tears
She felt that somehow she had failed that Art Osgood was slipping through her fingers in spite of the fact that he did not seem to fear her or to oppose her except in the final accusation
It was the lack of opposition that lack of fear that baffled her so
Art she felt dimly must be very sure of his own position was it because he was so close to the Mexican line
Jean glanced desperately that way
It was very close
She could see the features of the Mexican soldiers lounging before the cantina over there through the lighted window of the customhouse she could see a dark faced officer bending over a littered desk
The guard over there spoke to a friend and she could hear the words he said
Jean thought swiftly
She must not let Art Osgood go back across that street
She could cover him with her gunArt knew how well she could use itand she would call for an American officer and have him arrested
Or Lite was somewhere below she would call for Lite and he could go and get an officer and a warrant
How soon you going back
Art asked abruptly as though he had been pondering a problem and had reached the solution
Ill have to get a leave of absence or go down on the books as a deserter and I wouldnt want that
I can get it all right
Ill go back with you and straighten this thing out if its the way you say it is
I sure didnt know theyd pulled your dad for it Jean
This coming so close upon the heels of her own decision set Jean all at sea again
She looked at him doubtfully
I thought you said you didnt know and you wouldnt go back
Art grinned sardonically
Ill lie any time to help a friend he admitted frankly
What I do draw the line at is lying to help some cowardly cuss doublecross a man
Your father got the doublecross I dont stand for anything like that
Not atall
He heaved a sigh of nervous relaxation for the last half hour had been keyed rather high for them both and pulled his hat down on his head
Say Jean
Want to go across with me and meet the general
You can make my talk a whole lot stronger by telling what you came for
Ill get leave all right then
And youll know for sure that Im playing straight
You see that twostory dobe about halfway down the blockthe one with the Mexican flag over it
He pointed
Theres where he is
Want to go over
Any objections to taking me along with you
This was Lite coming nonchalantly toward them from the doorway
Lite was still perfectly willing to let Jean manage this affair in her own way but that did not mean that he would not continue to watch over her
Lite was much like a man who lets a small boy believe he is driving a skittish team all alone
Jean believed that she was acting alone in this as in everything else
She had yet to learn that Lite had for three years been always at hand ready to take the lines if the team proved too fractious for her
Art turned and put out his hand
Why hello Lite
Sure you can come along glad to have you
He eyed Lite questioningly
Ill gamble youve heard all weve been talking about he said
That would be you all right
So you dont need any wising up
Come on I want to catch the chief before he goes off somewhere
To see the three of them go down the stairs and out upon the street and across it into Mexicowhich to Jean seemed very queeryou would never dream of the quest that had brought them together down here on the border
Even Jean was smiling in a tired anxious way
She walked close to Lite and never once asked him how he came to be there or why
She was glad that he was there
She was glad to shift the whole matter to his broad shoulders now and let him take the lead
They had a real Mexican dinner in a queer little adobe place where Art advised them quite seriously never to come alone
They had thick soup with a strange flavor and Art talked with the waiter in Mexican dialect that made Jean glad indeed to feel Lites elbow touching hers and to know that although Lites hand rested idly on his knee it was only one second from his weapon
She had no definite suspicion of Art Osgood but all the same she was thankful that she was not there alone with him among all these dark sharp eyed Mexicans with their atmosphere of latent treachery
Lite ate mostly with his left hand
Jean noticed that
It was the only sign of watchfulness that he betrayed unless one added the fact that he had chosen a seat which brought his back against an adobe wall and his face toward Art and the room with Jean beside him
That might have been pure chance and it might not
But Art was evidently playing fair
A little later they came back to the Casa del Sonora and Jean went up to her room feeling that a great burden had been lifted from her shoulders
Lite and Art Osgood were out on the veranda gossiping of the range and in Arts pocket was a months leave of absence from his duties
Once she heard Lite laugh and she stood with one hand full of hairpins and the other holding the brush and listened and smiled a little
It all sounded very companionable very carefreenot in the least as though they were about to clear up an old wrong
She got into bed and thumped the hard pillow into a little nest for her tired head and listened languidly to the familiar voices that came to her mingled with confused noises of the street
Lite was on guard he would not lose his caution just because Art seemed friendly and helpfully inclined and had meant no treachery over in that queer restaurant
Lite would not be easily tricked
So she presently fell asleep
CHAPTER XXIII A LITTLE ENLIGHTENMENT Sometime in the night Jean awoke to hear footsteps in the corridor outside her room
She sat up with a start and her right hand went groping for her gun
Just for the moment she thought that she was in her room at the Lazy A and that the nightprowler had come and was beginning his stealthy search of the house
Then she heard some one down in the street call out a swift sentence in Spanish and get a laugh for an answer
She remembered that she was in Nogales within talking distance of Mexico and that she had found Art Osgood and that he did not behave like a fugitive murderer but like a friend who was anxious to help free her father
The footsteps went on down the hallthe footsteps of Lite who had come and stood for a minute outside her door to make sure that all was quiet and that she slept
But Jean now that she knew where she was lay wide awake and thinking
Suddenly she sat up again staring straight before her
That letterthe letter Art had taken to her father the letter he had read and put in the pocket of his chaps
Was that what the man had been hunting for those nights when he had come searching in that secret stealthy way
She did not remember ever having looked into the pocket of her fathers chaps though they had hung in her room all those three years since the tragedy
Pockets in chaps were not as a general thing much used
Men carried matches in them sometimes or money
The flap over her dads chappocket was buttoned down and the leather was stiff perhaps the letter was there yet
She got up and turned on the light and looked at her watch
She wanted to start then that instant for Los Angeles
She wanted to take her dads chaps out of her trunk where she had packed them just for the comfort of having them with her and she wanted to look and see if the letter was there still
There was no particular reason for believing that this was of any particular importance or had any bearing whatever upon the crime
But the idea was there and it nagged at her
Her watch said that it was twentyfive minutes after two oclock
The train Lite had told her would leave for Tucson at sevenfortyfive in the morning
She told herself that since it was too far to walk and since she could not start any sooner by staying up and freezing she might just as well get back into bed and try to sleep
But she could not sleep
She kept thinking of the letter and trying to imagine what clue it could possibly give if she found it still in the pocket
Carl had sent it Art said
A thought came to Jean which she tried to ignore and because she tried to ignore it it returned with a dogged insistence and took clearer shape in her mind and formed itself into questions which she was compelled at last to face and try to answer
Was it her Uncle Carl who had come and searched the house at night trying to find that letter
If it were her uncle why was he so anxious to find it after three years had passed
What was in the letter
If it had any bearing whatever upon the death of Johnny Croft why hadnt her dad mentioned it
Why hadnt her Uncle Carl said something about it
Was the letter just a note about some ranch business
Then why else should any one come at night and prowl all through the house and never take anything
Why had he come that first night
Jean drew in her breath sharply
All at once like a flashlight turned upon a dark corner of her mind she remembered something about that night
She remembered how she had told her Uncle Carl that she meant to prove that her dad was innocent that she meant to investigate the devious process by which the Lazy A ranch and all the stock had ceased to belong to her or her father that she meant to adopt sly sleuthlike methods she remembered the very words which she had used
She remembered how bitter her uncle had become
Had she frightened him somehow with her bold declaration that she would not let sleeping dogs lie any longer
Had he remembered the letter and been uneasy because of what was in it
But what COULD be in it if it were written at least a day before the terrible thing had happened
She remembered her uncles uncontrolled fury that evening when she had ridden over to see Lite
What had she said to cause it
She tried to recall her words and finally she did remember saying something about proving that her own money had been paying for her keep for three years
Then he had gone into that rage and she had not at the time seen any connection between her words and his raving anger
But perhaps there was a connection
Perhaps Oh my goodness
she exclaimed aloud
She was remembering the telegram which she had sent him just before she left Los Angeles for Nogales
Hell just simply go WILD when he gets that wire
She recalled now how he had insisted all along that Art Osgood knew absolutely nothing about the murder she recalled also with an uncanny sort of vividness Arts manner when he had admitted for the second time that the letter had been from Carl
She remembered how he had changed when he found that her father was being punished for the crime
She did not know just yet how all these tangled facts were going to work out
She had not yet come to the final question that she would presently be asking herself
She felt sure that her uncle knew more a great deal moreabout Johnny Crofts death than he had appeared to know but she had not yet reached the point to which her reasonings inevitably would bring her perhaps her mind was subconsciously delaying the ultimate conclusion
She got up and dressed unfastening her window she stepped out on the veranda
The street was quiet at that time in the morning
A sentry stood on guard at the corner and here and there a light flared in some window where others were wakeful
But for the most part the town lay asleep
Over in what was really the Mexican quarter three or four roosters were crowing as if they would never leave off
The sound of them depressed Jean and made her feel how heavy was the weight of her great undertakingheavier now when the end was almost in sight than it had seemed on that moonlight night when she had ridden over to the Lazy A and had not the faintest idea of how she was going to accomplish any part of her task which she had set herself
She shivered and turned back to get the gay serape which she had bought from an old Mexican woman when they were coming out of that queer restaurant last evening
When she came out again Lite was standing there smoking a cigarette and leaning against a post
Youd better get some sleep Jean he reproved her when she came and stood beside him
You had a pretty hard day yesterday and today wont be any easier
Better go back and lie down
Jean merely pulled the serape snugger about her shoulders and sat down sidewise upon the railing
I couldnt sleep she said
If I could I wouldnt be out here Id be asleep wouldnt I
Why dont you go to bed yourself
Ahh Arts learned to talk Spanish he said drily
I got myself all worked up trying to make out what he was trying to say in his sleep and then I found out it wasnt my kinda talk anyway
So I quit
Whats the matter that you cant sleep
Jean stared down at the shadowy street
A dog ran out from somewhere sniffed at a doorstep and trotted over into Mexico and up to the sentry
The sentry patted it on the head and muttered a friendly word or two
Jean watched him absently
It was all so peaceful
Not at all what one would expect after seeing pictures of all those refugees and all those soldiers fighting and the dead lying in the street in some little town whose name she could not pronounce correctly
Did you hear Art tell about taking a letter to dad the day before
she asked abruptly
He wasnt telling the truth not all the time
But somehow I believe that was the truth
He said dad stuck it in the pocket of his chaps
I believe its there yet Lite
I dont remember ever looking into that pocket
And I believeLite I never said anything about it but somebody kept coming to the house in the night and hunting around through all the rooms
He never came into my room so II didnt bother him but Ive wondered what he was after
It just occurred to me that maybe I never could figure out what he was after either Lite observed quietly
You
Jean turned her head so that her eyes shone in the light of a street lamp while she looked up at him
How in the world did you know about him
Lite laughed drily
I dont think theres much concerns you that I dont know he confessed
I saw him I guess every time he came around
He couldnt have made a crooked moveand got away with it
But I never could figure him out exactly
Jean looked at him touched by the care of her that he had betrayed in those few words
Always she had accepted him as the one friend who never failed her but latelysince the advent of the motionpicture people to be exacta new note had crept into his friendship a new meaning into his watching over her
She had sensed it but she had never faced it openly
She pulled her thoughts away from it now
Did you know who he was
It was like Jean to come straight to the point
Lite smiled faintly he knew that question would come and he knew that he would have to answer it
Sure
I made it my business to know who he was
Who was it Lite
Lite did not say
He knew that question was coming also but he did not know whether he ought to answer it
It was Uncle Carl wasnt it
Lite glanced down at her quickly
Youre a good little guesser
Then it was that letter he was after
She was silent for a minute and then she looked at her watch
And I cant get at those chaps before tomorrow
She sighed and leaned back against the post
Lite if it was worth all that hunting for it must mean something to us
I wonder what it can be dont you know
No said Lite slowly I dont
And its something a man dont want to do any guessing about
This Jean felt was a gentle reproof for her own speculations upon the subject
She said no more about the letter
I sent him a telegram she informed Lite irrelevantly saying Id located Art and was going to take him back there
I wonder what he thought when he got that
Lite turned half around and stared down at her
He opened his lips to speak hesitated and closed them without making a sound
He turned away and stared down into the street that was so empty
After a little he glanced at his own watch with the same impulse Jean had felt
The hours and minutes were beginning to drag their feet as they passed
You go in he ordered gently and lie down
Youll be all worn out when the time comes for you to get busy
We dont know whats ahead of us on this trail Jean
Right now its peaceful as Sunday morning down in Maine so you go in and get some sleep while you have a chance and stop thinking about things
Go on Jean
Ill call you plenty early you neednt be afraid of missing the train
Jean smiled a little at the tender protective note of authority in his voice and manner
Whether she permitted it or not Lite would go right on watching over her and taking care of her
With a sudden desire to please him she rose obediently
When she passed him she reached out and gave his arm a little squeeze
You cantankerous old tyrant she drawled in a whisper you do love to haze me around dont you
Just to spite you Ill do it
She went in and left him standing there smoking and leaning against the post calm as the stars above
But under that surface calm the heart of Lite Avery was thumping violently
His arm quivered still under the thrill of Jeans fingers
Your bottledup souls are quick to sense the meaning in a tone or a touch Jean whether she herself knew it or not had betrayed an emotion that set Lites thoughts racing out into a golden future
He stood there a long while staring out upon the darkness his eyes shining
CHAPTER XXIV THE LETTER IN THE CHAPS Though hours may drag themselves into the past so sluggishly that one is fairly maddened by the snails pace of them into the past they must go eventually
Jean had sat and listened to the wheels of the Golden State Limited clank over the cryptic phrase that meant so much
Letterinthechaps
Letterinthe chaps
was what they had said while the train pounded across the desert and slid through arroyas and deep cuts which leveled hills for its passing
Letter inthechaps
Letterinthechaps
And then a silence while they stood by some desolate station where the people were swarthy of skin and black of hair and eyes and moved languidly if they moved at all
Then they would go on and when the wheels had clicked over the switches of the various side tracks they would take up again the refrain Letterinthechaps
Letter inthechaps
until Jean thought she would go crazy if they kept it up much longer
Little by little they drew near to Los Angeles
And then they were there sliding slowly through the yards in a drab drizzle of one of Californias fall rains
Then they were in a taxicab making for the Third Street tunnel
Then Jean stared heavyeyed at the dripping palms along the boulevard which led away from the smoke of the city and into Hollywood snuggled against the misty hills
Letterinthechaps
her tired brain repeated it still
Then she was in the apartment shared with Muriel Gay and her mother
These two were over at the studio the landlady told her when she let them in and Jean was glad that they were gone
She knelt still in her hat and coat and with her gloves on and fitted her trunk key into the lock
And there she stopped
What if the letter were not in the chaps after all
What if it were but a trivial note concerning a matter long since forgotten a trivial note that had not the remotest bearing upon the murder
Letterinthechaps
The phrase returned with a mocking note and beat insistently through her brain
She sat back on the floor and shivered with the chill of a fireless room in California when a fall rain is at its drizzling worst
In the next room one of the men coughed afterwards she heard Lites voice saying something in an undertone to Art Osgood
She heard Arts voice mutter a reply
She raised herself again to her knees turned the key in the lock and lifted the trunklid with an air of determination
Down next the bottom of her big trunk they lay just as she had packed them away with her dads sixshooter and belt carefully disposed between the leathern folds
She groped with her hands under a couple of riding skirts and her high laced boots got a firm grip on the fringed leather and dragged them out
She had forgotten all about the gun and belt until they fell with a thump on the floor
She pulled out the belt left the gun lying there by the trunk and hurried out with the chaps dangling over her arm
She was pale when she stood before the two who sat there waiting with their hats in their hands and their faces full of repressed eagerness
Her fingers trembled while she pulled at the stiff leather flap of the pocket to free it from the button
Maybe it aint there yet Art hazarded nervously while they watched her
But thats where he put it all right
I saw him
Jeans fingers went groping into the pocket stayed there for a second or two and came out holding a folded envelope
Thats it
Art leaned toward her eagerly
Thats the one all right
Jean sat down suddenly because her knees seemed to bend under her weight
Three yearsand that letter within her reach all the time
Lets see Jean
Lite reached out and took it from her nerveless fingers
Maybe it wont amount to anything at all
Jean tried to hold herself calm
Read itout loud she said
Then well know
She tried to smile and made so great a failure of it that she came very near crying
The faint crackle of the cheap paper when Lite unfolded the letter made her start nervously
Read itno matterwhat it is she repeated when she saw Lites eyes go rapidly over the lines
Lite glanced at her sharply then leaned and took her hand and held it close
His firm clasp steadied her more than any words could have done
Without further delay or attempt to palliate its grim significance he read the note Aleck If Johnny Croft comes to you with anything about me kick him off the ranch
He claims he knows a whole lot about me branding too many calves
Dont believe anything he tells you
Hes just trying to make trouble because he claims I underpaid him
He was telling Art a lot of stuff that he claimed he could prove on me but its all a lie
Send him to me if he comes looking for trouble
Ill give him all he wants
Art found a heifer down in the breaks that looks like she might have blackleg
Im going down there to see about it
Maybe you better ride over and see what you think about it we dont want to let anything like that get a start on us
Dont pay any attention to Johnny
Ill fix him if he dont keep his face shut
CARL
Carl
Jean repeated the name mechanically
Carl
I kinda thought it was something like that Art Osgood interrupted her to say
Now you know that much and Ill tell you just what I know about it
It was Carl shot Crofty all right
I rode over with him to the Lazy A I was on my way to town and we went that far together
I rode that way to tell you goodby
He looked at Jean with a certain diffidence
I kinda wanted to see you before I went clear outa the country but you werent at home
Johnny Crofts horse was standing outside the house when we rode up
I guess he must have just got there ahead of us
Carl got off and went in ahead of me
Johnny was eating a snack when I went in
He said something to Carl and Carl flared up
I saw there wasnt anybody at home and I didnt want to get mixed up in the argument so I turned and went on out
And I hadnt more than got to my horse when I heard a shot and Carl came running out with his gun in his hand
Well Johnny was dead and there wasnt anything I could do about it
Carl told me to beat it outa the country just like Id been planning he said it would be a whole lot better for him seeing I wasnt an eye witness
He said Johnny started to draw his gun and he shot in selfdefense and he said I better go while the going was good or I might get pulled into it some way
Well I thought it over for a minute and I didnt see where it would get me anything to stay
I couldnt help Carl any by staying because I wasnt in the house when it happened
So I hit the trail for town and never said anything to anybody
He looked at the two contritely
I never knew till you folks came to Nogales looking for me that things panned out the way they did
I thought Carl was going to give himself up and would be cleared
I never once dreamed he was the kinda mark that would let his own brother take the blame that way
I guess nobody did
Lite folded the letter and pushed it back into the envelope
I can look back now though and see how it come about
He hung back till Aleck found the body and was arrested and after that he just simply didnt have the nerve to step out and say that he was the one that did it
He tried hard to save Aleck but he wouldnt The coward
The low mean coward
Jean stood up and looked from one to the other and spoke through her clinched teeth
To let dad suffer all this while
Lite when did you say that train left for Salt Lake
We can take the taxi back down town and save time
She was at the door when she turned toward the two again
Hurry up
Dont you know weve got to hurry
Dads in prison all this while
And Uncle Carltheres no telling where Uncle Carl is
That wire I sent him was the worst thing I could have done
Or the best suggested Lite laconically as he led the way down the hall and out to the raindrenched waiting taxicab
CHAPTER XXV LITE COMES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND For hours Jean had sat staring out at the drear stretches of desert dripping under the dismal rain that streaked the car windows
The clouds hung leaden and gray close over the earth the smoke from the engine trailed a funereal plume across the greasewood covered plain
Away in the distance a low line of hills stretched vaguely as though they were placed there to hold up the sky that was so heavy and dank
Alongside the track every ditch ran full of claycolored water that wrapped little ragged wreaths of dirty foam around every obstruction like the tawdry finery of the slums
From the smokingroom where he had been for the past two hours with Art Osgood Lite came unsteadily down the aisle heralded as it were by the muffled scream of the whistle at a country crossing
Jean turned toward him a face as depressed as the desert out there under the rain
Lite looking at her keenly saw on her cheeks the traces of tears
He let himself down wearily into the seat beside her reached over calmly and took her hand from off her lap and held it snugly in his own
This is likely a snowstorm up home he said in his quiet matteroffact way
I guess well have to make our headquarters in town till I get things hauled out to the ranch
Thats it when you cant look ahead and see whats coming
I could have had everything ready to go right on out only I thought there wouldnt be any use before spring anyway
But if this storm aint a blizzard up there a couple of days will straighten things out
Jean turned her head and regarded him attentively
Out where
she asked him bluntly
What are you talking about
Have you and Art been celebrating
She knew better than that
Lite never indulged in liquid celebrations and Jean knew it
Lite reached into his pocket with the hand that was free and drew forth a telegram envelope
He released her hand while he drew out the message but he did not hand it to her immediately
I wired Rossman from Los Angeles he informed her and told him what was up and asked him to put me up to date on that end of the line
So he did
I got this back there at that last town
He laid his hand over hers again and looked down at her sidelong
Ever since the trouble he began abruptly but still in that quiet matteroffact way Ive been playing a lone hand and kinda holding back and waiting for something to drop
I had that idea all along that youve had this summer getting hold of the Lazy A and fixing it up so your dad would have a place to come back to
I never said anything because talking dont come natural to me like it does to some and Id rather do a thing first and then talk about it afterwards if I have to
So I hung on to what money I had saved up along I was going to get me a bunch of cattle and fix up that homestead of mine some day and maybe have a little home
His eyes went surreptitiously to her face and lingered there wistfully
So after the trouble I buckled down to work and saved a little faster if anything
It looked to me like there wasnt much hope of doing anything for your dad till his sentence ran out so I never said anything about it
Long as Carl didnt try to sell it to anybody else I just waited and got together all the money I could
I didnt see as there was anything else to do
Jean was chewing a corner of her lip and was staring out of the window
I didnt know I was stealing your thunder Lite she said dispiritedly
Why didnt you tell me
Wasnt anything to telltill there was something to tell
Now this telegram herethis is what I started out to talk about
Itll be just as well if you know it before we get to Helena
I showed it to Art and he thought the same as I did
You knowor I reckon you dont because I never said anything away last summer along about the time you went to work for Burns I got to thinking things over and I wondered if Carl didnt have something on his mind about that killing
So I wrote to Rossman
I didnt much like the way he handled your dads case but he knew all the ins and outs so I could talk to him without going away back at the beginning
He knew Carl too so that made it easier
I wrote and told him how Carl was prowling around through the house nights and the like of that and to look up the title to the Lazy A Why wouldnt you wait and let me buy it myself
Jean asked him with just a shade of sharpness in her voice
You knew I wanted to
So I got Rossman started quite a while back
He thought as I did that Carl was acting mighty funny
I was with Carl more than you was and I could tell he had something laying heavy on his mind
But then the rest of us had things laying pretty heavy on our minds too that wasnt guilt so there wasnt any way to tell what was bothering Carl
Lite made no attempt to answer the question she had asked
Now heres this wire Rossman sent me
You dont want to get the wrong idea Jean and feel too bad about this
You dont want to think you had anything to do with it
Carl was gradually building up to something of this kindhas been for a long time
His coming over to the ranch nights looking for that letter that he had hunted all over for at first shows he wasnt right in his mind on the subject
But Well heavens and earth Lite
Jeans tone was exasperated more than it was worried
Why dont you say what you want to say
Whats it all about
Let me read that telegram and be done with it
II should think youd know I can stand things by this time
I havent shown any weak knees have I
Well I hate to pile on any more Lite muttered defensively
But youve got to know this
I wish you didnt but Jean did not say any more
She reached over and with her free hand took the telegram from him
She did not pull away the hand Lite was holding however and the heart of him gave an exultant bound because she let it lie there quiet under his own
She pinched her brows together over the message and let it drop into her lap
Her head went back against the towel covered headrest and for a minute her eyes closed as if she could not look any longer upon trouble
Lite waited a second pulled her head over against his shoulder and picked up the telegram and read it through slowly though he could have repeated it word for word with his eyes shut
L Avery En Route Train 23 S L  D R R Carl Douglas suicided yesterday leaving letter confessing murder of Croft
Had just completed transfer of land and cattle to your name
Am taking steps placing matter before governor immediately expect him to act at once upon pardon
Bring your man my office at once deposition may be required
J W ROSSMAN
Now I told you not to worry about this Lite reminded the girl firmly
Looks to me like it takes a load off our handsCarls doing what he done
Saves us dragging it all through court again and Jean itll let your dad out a whole lot quicker
Sounds kinda coldblooded maybe but if you could look at it as good newsthats the way it strikes me
Jean did not say a word just then
She did what you might not expect Jean to do after all her strong mindedness and her independence She made an uncertain movement toward sitting up and facing things calmly manfashion then she leaned and dropped her very independent brown head back upon Lites shoulder and behind her handkerchief she cried quietly while Lite held her close
Now thats long enough to cry he whispered to her after a season of mental intoxication such as he had never before experienced
I started out three years ago to be the boss
I aint been working at it regular as you might say all the time
But Im going to wind up that way
I hate to turn you over to your dad without some little show of making good at the job
Jean gave a little gurgle that may have been related to laughter and Lites lips quirked with humorous embarrassment as he went on
I dont guess he said slowly that Im going to turn you over at all Jean
Not altogether
I guess Ive just about got to keep you
Ittakes two to make a home andIve got my heart set on us making a home outa the Lazy A again you and me making a home for us and your dad
Howhow does that sound to you Jean
Jean was wiping her eyes as unobtrusively as she might
She did not answer
How does it sound you and me making a home together
Lite was growing pale and his hands trembled
Tell me
It soundsgood said Jean unsteadily
For several minutes Lite did not say a word
They sat there holding hands quite foolishly and stared out at the drenched desert
Soon as your dad comes he said at last very simply well be married
He was silent another minute and added under his breath like a prayer And well all gohome
CHAPTER XXVI HOW HAPPINESS RETURNED TO THE LAZY A When Lite rapped with his knuckles on the door of the room where she was waiting Jean stood with her hands pressed tightly over her face every muscle rigid with the restraint she was putting upon herself
For Lite this threeday interval had been too full of going here and there attending to the manifold details of untangling the various threads of their broken lifepattern for him to feel the suspense which Jean had suffered
She had not done much
She had waited
And now with Lite and her dad standing outside the door she almost dreaded the meeting
But she took a deep breath and walked to the door and opened it
Hello dad she cried with a nervous gaiety
Give your dear daughter a kiss
She had not meant to say that at all
Tall and gaunt and gray and old lines etched deep ground his bitter mouth pale with the tragic prison pallor looking out at the world with the somber eyes of one who has suffered most cruellyAleck Douglas put out his thin shaking arms and held her close
He did not say anything at all and the kiss she asked for he laid softly upon her hair
Lite stood in the doorway and looked at the two of them for a moment
Im going down to see about things
Ill be back in a little while
And Jean will you be ready
Jean looked up at him understandingly and with a certain shyness in her eyes
If its all right with dad she told him Ill be ready
Lites a man
Aleck stated unsmilingly with a trace of that apathy which had hurt Jean so in the wardens office
Im glad youll have him to take care of you Jean
So Lite closed the door softly and went away and left those two alone
In a very few words I can tell you the rest
There were a few things to adjust and a few arrangements to make
The greatest adjustment perhaps was when Jean begged off from that contract with the Great Western Company
Dewitt did not want to let her go but he had read a marked article in a Montana paper that Lite mailed to him in advance of their return and he realized that some things are greater even than the needs of a motionpicture company
He was very nice therefore to Jean
He told her by all means to consider herself free to give her time wholly to her father and her husband
He also congratulated Lite in terms that made Jean blush and beat a hurried retreat from his office and that made Lite grin all the way to the hotel
So the public lost Jean of the Lazy A almost as soon as it had learned to welcome her
Then there was Pard that had to leave the little buckskin and take that nerveracking trip back to the Lazy A Lite attended to that with perfect calm and a good deal of inner elation
So that detail was soon adjusted
At the Lazy A there was a great deal to do before the traces of its tragedy were wiped out
Well have to leave them doing that work which was only a matter of time after all and not nearly so hard to accomplish as their attempts to wipe out from Alecks soul the black scar of those three years
I think on the whole we shall leave them doing that work too
As much as human love and happiness could do toward wiping out the bitterness they would accomplish you may be sure give them time enough
