ANN VERONICA CHAPTER THE FIRST ANN VERONICA TALKS TO HER FATHER Part 1 One Wednesday afternoon in late September Ann Veronica Stanley came down from London in a state of solemn excitement and quite resolved to have things out with her father that very evening
She had trembled on the verge of such a resolution before but this time quite definitely she made it
A crisis had been reached and she was almost glad it had been reached
She made up her mind in the train home that it should be a decisive crisis
It is for that reason that this novel begins with her there and neither earlier nor later for it is the history of this crisis and its consequences that this novel has to tell
She had a compartment to herself in the train from London to Morningside Park and she sat with both her feet on the seat in an attitude that would certainly have distressed her mother to see and horrified her grandmother beyond measure she sat with her knees up to her chin and her hands clasped before them and she was so lost in thought that she discovered with a start from a lettered lamp that she was at Morningside Park and thought she was moving out of the station whereas she was only moving in
Lord
she said
She jumped up at once caught up a leather clutch containing notebooks a fat textbook and a chocolateandyellowcovered pamphlet and leaped neatly from the carriage only to discover that the train was slowing down and that she had to traverse the full length of the platform past it again as the result of her precipitation
Sold again she remarked
Idiot
She raged inwardly while she walked along with that air of selfcontained serenity that is proper to a young lady of nearly twoandtwenty under the eye of the world
She walked down the station approach past the neat obtrusive offices of the coal merchant and the house agent and so to the wicketgate by the butchers shop that led to the field path to her home
Outside the postoffice stood a nohatted blond young man in gray flannels who was elaborately affixing a stamp to a letter
At the sight of her he became rigid and a singularly bright shade of pink
She made herself serenely unaware of his existence though it may be it was his presence that sent her by the field detour instead of by the direct path up the Avenue
Umph
he said and regarded his letter doubtfully before consigning it to the pillarbox
Here goes he said
Then he hovered undecidedly for some seconds with his hands in his pockets and his mouth puckered to a whistle before he turned to go home by the Avenue
Ann Veronica forgot him as soon as she was through the gate and her face resumed its expression of stern preoccupation
Its either now or never she said to herself



Morningside Park was a suburb that had not altogether as people say come off
It consisted like preRoman Gaul of three parts
There was first the Avenue which ran in a consciously elegant curve from the railway station into an undeveloped wilderness of agriculture with big yellow brick villas on either side and then there was the pavement the little clump of shops about the postoffice and under the railway arch was a congestion of workmens dwellings
The road from Surbiton and Epsom ran under the arch and like a bright fungoid growth in the ditch there was now appearing a sort of fourth estate of little redandwhite roughcast villas with meretricious gables and very brassy windowblinds
Behind the Avenue was a little hill and an ironfenced path went over the crest of this to a stile under an elmtree and forked there with one branch going back into the Avenue again
Its either now or never said Ann Veronica again ascending this stile
Much as I hate rows Ive either got to make a stand or give in altogether
She seated herself in a loose and easy attitude and surveyed the backs of the Avenue houses then her eyes wandered to where the new redandwhite villas peeped among the trees
She seemed to be making some sort of inventory
Ye Gods
she said at last
WHAT a place
Stuffy isnt the word for it
I wonder what he takes me for
When presently she got down from the stile a certain note of internal conflict a touch of doubt had gone from her warmtinted face
She had now the clear and tranquil expression of one whose mind is made up
Her back had stiffened and her hazel eyes looked steadfastly ahead
As she approached the corner of the Avenue the blond nohatted man in gray flannels appeared
There was a certain air of forced fortuity in his manner
He saluted awkwardly
Hello Vee
he said
Hello Teddy
she answered
He hung vaguely for a moment as she passed
But it was clear she was in no mood for Teddys
He realized that he was committed to the path across the fields an uninteresting walk at the best of times
Oh dammit
he remarked dammit
with great bitterness as he faced it
Part 2 Ann Veronica Stanley was twentyone and a half years old
She had black hair fine eyebrows and a clear complexion and the forces that had modelled her features had loved and lingered at their work and made them subtle and fine
She was slender and sometimes she seemed tall and walked and carried herself lightly and joyfully as one who commonly and habitually feels well and sometimes she stooped a little and was preoccupied
Her lips came together with an expression between contentment and the faintest shadow of a smile her manner was one of quiet reserve and behind this mask she was wildly discontented and eager for freedom and life
She wanted to live
She was vehemently impatientshe did not clearly know for whatto do to be to experience
And experience was slow in coming
All the world about her seemed to behow can one put it
in wrappers like a house when people leave it in the summer
The blinds were all drawn the sunlight kept out one could not tell what colors these gray swathings hid
She wanted to know
And there was no intimation whatever that the blinds would ever go up or the windows or doors be opened or the chandeliers that seemed to promise such a blaze of fire unveiled and furnished and lit
Dim souls flitted about her not only speaking but it would seem even thinking in undertones



During her school days especially her earlier school days the world had been very explicit with her telling her what to do what not to do giving her lessons to learn and games to play and interests of the most suitable and various kinds
Presently she woke up to the fact that there was a considerable group of interests called being in love and getting married with certain attractive and amusing subsidiary developments such as flirtation and being interested in people of the opposite sex
She approached this field with her usual liveliness of apprehension
But here she met with a check
These interests her world promptly through the agency of schoolmistresses older schoolmates her aunt and a number of other responsible and authoritative people assured her she must on no account think about
Miss Moffatt the history and moral instruction mistress was particularly explicit upon this score and they all agreed in indicating contempt and pity for girls whose minds ran on such matters and who betrayed it in their conversation or dress or bearing
It was in fact a group of interests quite unlike any other group peculiar and special and one to be thoroughly ashamed of
Nevertheless Ann Veronica found it a difficult matter not to think of these things
However having a considerable amount of pride she decided she would disavow these undesirable topics and keep her mind away from them just as far as she could but it left her at the end of her school days with that wrapped feeling I have described and rather at loose ends
The world she discovered with these matters barred had no particular place for her at all nothing for her to do except a functionless existence varied by calls tennis selected novels walks and dusting in her fathers house
She thought study would be better
She was a clever girl the best of her year in the High School and she made a valiant fight for Somerville or Newnham but her father had met and argued with a Somerville girl at a friends dinnertable and he thought that sort of thing unsexed a woman
He said simply that he wanted her to live at home
There was a certain amount of disputation and meanwhile she went on at school
They compromised at length on the science course at the Tredgold Womens Collegeshe had already matriculated into London University from schoolshe came of age and she bickered with her aunt for latchkey privileges on the strength of that and her season ticket
Shamefaced curiosities began to come back into her mind thinly disguised as literature and art
She read voraciously and presently because of her aunts censorship she took to smuggling any books she thought might be prohibited instead of bringing them home openly and she went to the theatre whenever she could produce an acceptable friend to accompany her
She passed her general science examination with double honors and specialized in science
She happened to have an acute sense of form and unusual mental lucidity and she found in biology and particularly in comparative anatomy a very considerable interest albeit the illumination it cast upon her personal life was not altogether direct
She dissected well and in a year she found herself chafing at the limitations of the lady B Sc
who retailed a store of faded learning in the Tredgold laboratory
She had already realized that this instructress was hopelessly wrong and foggyit is the test of the good comparative anatomistupon the skull
She discovered a desire to enter as a student in the Imperial College at Westminster where Russell taught and go on with her work at the fountainhead
She had asked about that already and her father had replied evasively Well have to see about that little Vee well have to see about that
In that posture of being seen about the matter hung until she seemed committed to another session at the Tredgold College and in the mean time a small conflict arose and brought the latchkey question and in fact the question of Ann Veronicas position generally to an acute issue
In addition to the various business men solicitors civil servants and widow ladies who lived in the Morningside Park Avenue there was a certain family of alien sympathies and artistic quality the Widgetts with which Ann Veronica had become very friendly
Mr Widgett was a journalist and art critic addicted to a greenishgray tweed suit and art brown ties he smoked corncob pipes in the Avenue on Sunday morning travelled third class to London by unusual trains and openly despised golf
He occupied one of the smaller houses near the station
He had one son who had been coeducated and three daughters with peculiarly jolly red hair that Ann Veronica found adorable
Two of these had been her particular intimates at the High School and had done much to send her mind exploring beyond the limits of the available literature at home
It was a cheerful irresponsible shamelessly hardup family in the key of faded green and flattened purple and the girls went on from the High School to the Fadden Art School and a bright eventful life of art student dances Socialist meetings theatre galleries talking about work and even at intervals work and ever and again they drew Ann Veronica from her sound persistent industry into the circle of these experiences
They had asked her to come to the first of the two great annual Fadden Dances the October one and Ann Veronica had accepted with enthusiasm
And now her father said she must not go
He had put his foot down and said she must not go
Going involved two things that all Ann Veronicas tact had been ineffectual to conceal from her aunt and father
Her usual dignified reserve had availed her nothing
One point was that she was to wear fancy dress in the likeness of a Corsairs bride and the other was that she was to spend whatever vestiges of the night remained after the dance was over in London with the Widgett girls and a select party in quite a decent little hotel near Fitzroy Square
But my dear
said Ann Veronicas aunt
You see said Ann Veronica with the air of one who shares a difficulty Ive promised to go
I didnt realize I dont see how I can get out of it now
Then it was her father issued his ultimatum
He had conveyed it to her not verbally but by means of a letter which seemed to her a singularly ignoble method of prohibition
He couldnt look me in the face and say it said Ann Veronica
But of course its aunts doing really
And thus it was that as Ann Veronica neared the gates of home she said to herself Ill have it out with him somehow
Ill have it out with him
And if he wont But she did not give even unspoken words to the alternative at that time
Part 3 Ann Veronicas father was a solicitor with a good deal of company business a lean trustworthy worriedlooking neuralgic cleanshaven man of fiftythree with a hard mouth a sharp nose irongray hair gray eyes goldframed glasses and a small circular baldness at the crown of his head
His name was Peter
He had had five children at irregular intervals of whom Ann Veronica was the youngest so that as a parent he came to her perhaps a little practised and jaded and inattentive and he called her his little Vee and patted her unexpectedly and disconcertingly and treated her promiscuously as of any age between eleven and eightandtwenty
The City worried him a good deal and what energy he had left over he spent partly in golf a game he treated very seriously and partly in the practices of microscopic petrography
He went in for microscopy in the unphilosophical Victorian manner as his hobby
A birthday present of a microscope had turned his mind to technical microscopy when he was eighteen and a chance friendship with a Holborn microscope dealer had confirmed that bent
He had remarkably skilful fingers and a love of detailed processes and he had become one of the most dexterous amateur makers of rock sections in the world
He spent a good deal more money and time than he could afford upon the little room at the top of the house in producing new lapidary apparatus and new microscopic accessories and in rubbing down slices of rock to a transparent thinness and mounting them in a beautiful and dignified manner
He did it he said to distract his mind
His chief successes he exhibited to the Lowndean Microscopical Society where their high technical merit never failed to excite admiration
Their scientific value was less considerable since he chose rocks entirely with a view to their difficulty of handling or their attractiveness at conversaziones when done
He had a great contempt for the sections the theorizers produced
They proved all sorts of things perhaps but they were thick unequal pitiful pieces of work
Yet an indiscriminating wrongheaded world gave such fellows all sorts of distinctions
He read but little and that chiefly healthy light fiction with chromatic titles The Red Sword The Black Helmet The Purple Robe also in order to distract his mind
He read it in winter in the evening after dinner and Ann Veronica associated it with a tendency to monopolize the lamp and to spread a very worn pair of dappled fawnskin slippers across the fender
She wondered occasionally why his mind needed so much distraction
His favorite newspaper was the Times which he began at breakfast in the morning often with manifest irritation and carried off to finish in the train leaving no other paper at home
It occurred to Ann Veronica once that she had known him when he was younger but day had followed day and each had largely obliterated the impression of its predecessor
But she certainly remembered that when she was a little girl he sometimes wore tennis flannels and also rode a bicycle very dexterously in through the gates to the front door
And in those days too he used to help her mother with her gardening and hover about her while she stood on the ladder and hammered creepers to the scullery wall
It had been Ann Veronicas lot as the youngest child to live in a home that became less animated and various as she grew up
Her mother had died when she was thirteen her two much older sisters had married offone submissively one insubordinately her two brothers had gone out into the world well ahead of her and so she had made what she could of her father
But he was not a father one could make much of
His ideas about girls and women were of a sentimental and modest quality they were creatures he thought either too bad for a modern vocabulary and then frequently most undesirably desirable or too pure and good for life
He made this simple classification of a large and various sex to the exclusion of all intermediate kinds he held that the two classes had to be kept apart even in thought and remote from one another
Women are made like the potters vesselseither for worship or contumely and are withal fragile vessels
He had never wanted daughters
Each time a daughter had been born to him he had concealed his chagrin with great tenderness and effusion from his wife and had sworn unwontedly and with passionate sincerity in the bathroom
He was a manly man free from any strong maternal strain and he had loved his darkeyed dainty brightcolored and active little wife with a real vein of passion in his sentiment
But he had always felt he had never allowed himself to think of it that the promptitude of their family was a little indelicate of her and in a sense an intrusion
He had however planned brilliant careers for his two sons and with a certain human amount of warping and delay they were pursuing these
One was in the Indian Civil Service and one in the rapidly developing motor business
The daughters he had hoped would be their mothers care
He had no ideas about daughters
They happen to a man
Of course a little daughter is a delightful thing enough
It runs about gayly it romps it is bright and pretty it has enormous quantities of soft hair and more power of expressing affection than its brothers
It is a lovely little appendage to the mother who smiles over it and it does things quaintly like her gestures with her very gestures
It makes wonderful sentences that you can repeat in the City and are good enough for Punch
You call it a lot of nicknamesBabs and Bibs and Viddles and Vee you whack at it playfully and it whacks you back
It loves to sit on your knee
All that is jolly and as it should be
But a little daughter is one thing and a daughter quite another
There one comes to a relationship that Mr Stanley had never thought out
When he found himself thinking about it it upset him so that he at once resorted to distraction
The chromatic fiction with which he relieved his mind glanced but slightly at this aspect of life and never with any quality of guidance
Its heroes never had daughters they borrowed other peoples
The one fault indeed of this school of fiction for him was that it had rather a light way with parental rights
His instinct was in the direction of considering his daughters his absolute property bound to obey him his to give away or his to keep to be a comfort in his declining years just as he thought fit
About this conception of ownership he perceived and desired a certain sentimental glamour he liked everything properly dressed but it remained ownership
Ownership seemed only a reasonable return for the cares and expenses of a daughters upbringing
Daughters were not like sons
He perceived however that both the novels he read and the world he lived in discountenanced these assumptions
Nothing else was put in their place and they remained sotto voce as it were in his mind
The new and the old cancelled out his daughters became quasiindependent dependentswhich is absurd
One married as he wished and one against his wishes and now here was Ann Veronica his little Vee discontented with her beautiful safe and sheltering home going about with hatless friends to Socialist meetings and artclass dances and displaying a disposition to carry her scientific ambitions to unwomanly lengths
She seemed to think he was merely the paymaster handing over the means of her freedom
And now she insisted that she MUST leave the chastened security of the Tredgold Womens College for Russells unbridled classes and wanted to go to fancy dress dances in pirate costume and spend the residue of the night with Widgetts ramshackle girls in some indescribable hotel in Soho
He had done his best not to think about her at all but the situation and his sister had become altogether too urgent
He had finally put aside The Lilac Sunbonnet gone into his study lit the gas fire and written the letter that had brought these unsatisfactory relations to a head
Part 4 MY DEAR VEE he wrote
These daughters
He gnawed his pen and reflected tore the sheet up and began again
MY DEAR VERONICAYour aunt tells me you have involved yourself in some arrangement with the Widgett girls about a Fancy Dress Ball in London
I gather you wish to go up in some fantastic getup wrapped about in your opera cloak and that after the festivities you propose to stay with these friends of yours and without any older people in your party at an hotel
Now I am sorry to cross you in anything you have set your heart upon but I regret to say Hm he reflected and crossed out the last four words 
but this cannot be
No he said and tried again but I must tell you quite definitely that I feel it to be my duty to forbid any such exploit
Damn
he remarked at the defaced letter and taking a fresh sheet he recopied what he had written
A certain irritation crept into his manner as he did so
I regret that you should ever have proposed it he went on
He meditated and began a new paragraph
The fact of it is and this absurd project of yours only brings it to a head you have begun to get hold of some very queer ideas about what a young lady in your position may or may not venture to do
I do not think you quite understand my ideals or what is becoming as between father and daughter
Your attitude to me He fell into a brown study
It was so difficult to put precisely 
and your aunt For a time he searched for the mot juste
Then he went on and indeed to most of the established things in life is frankly unsatisfactory
You are restless aggressive critical with all the crude unthinking criticism of youth
You have no grasp upon the essential facts of life I pray God you never may and in your rash ignorance you are prepared to dash into positions that may end in lifelong regret
The life of a young girl is set about with prowling pitfalls
He was arrested for a moment by an indistinct picture of Veronica reading this last sentence
But he was now too deeply moved to trace a certain unsatisfactoriness to its source in a mixture of metaphors
Well he said argumentatively it IS
Thats all about it
Its time she knew
The life of a young girl is set about with prowling pitfalls from which she must be shielded at all costs
His lips tightened and he frowned with solemn resolution
So long as I am your father so long as your life is entrusted to my care I feel bound by every obligation to use my authority to check this odd disposition of yours toward extravagant enterprises
A day will come when you will thank me
It is not my dear Veronica that I think there is any harm in you there is not
But a girl is soiled not only by evil but by the proximity of evil and a reputation for rashness may do her as serious an injury as really reprehensible conduct
So do please believe that in this matter I am acting for the best
He signed his name and reflected
Then he opened the study door and called Mollie
and returned to assume an attitude of authority on the hearthrug before the blue flames and orange glow of the gas fire
His sister appeared
She was dressed in one of those complicated dresses that are all lace and work and confused patternings of black and purple and cream about the body and she was in many ways a younger feminine version of the same theme as himself
She had the same sharp nosewhich indeed only Ann Veronica of all the family had escaped
She carried herself well whereas her brother slouched and there was a certain aristocratic dignity about her that she had acquired through her long engagement to a curate of family a scion of the Wiltshire Edmondshaws
He had died before they married and when her brother became a widower she had come to his assistance and taken over much of the care of his youngest daughter
But from the first her rather oldfashioned conception of life had jarred with the suburban atmosphere the High School spirit and the memories of the light and little Mrs Stanley whose family had been by any reckoning inconsiderableto use the kindliest term
Miss Stanley had determined from the outset to have the warmest affection for her youngest niece and to be a second mother in her lifea second and a better one but she had found much to battle with and there was much in herself that Ann Veronica failed to understand
She came in now with an air of reserved solicitude
Mr Stanley pointed to the letter with a pipe he had drawn from his jacket pocket
What do you think of that
he asked
She took it up in her manyringed hands and read it judicially
He filled his pipe slowly
Yes she said at last it is firm and affectionate
I could have said more
You seem to have said just what had to be said
It seems to me exactly what is wanted
She really must not go to that affair
She paused and he waited for her to speak
I dont think she quite sees the harm of those people or the sort of life to which they would draw her she said
They would spoil every chance
She has chances
he said helping her out
She is an extremely attractive girl she said and added to some people
Of course one doesnt like to talk about things until there are things to talk about
All the more reason why she shouldnt get herself talked about
That is exactly what I feel
Mr Stanley took the letter and stood with it in his hand thoughtfully for a time
Id give anything he remarked to see our little Vee happily and comfortably married
He gave the note to the parlormaid the next morning in an inadvertent casual manner just as he was leaving the house to catch his London train
When Ann Veronica got it she had at first a wild fantastic idea that it contained a tip
Part 5 Ann Veronicas resolve to have things out with her father was not accomplished without difficulty
He was not due from the City until about six and so she went and played Badminton with the Widgett girls until dinnertime
The atmosphere at dinner was not propitious
Her aunt was blandly amiable above a certain tremulous undertow and talked as if to a caller about the alarming spread of marigolds that summer at the end of the garden a sort of Yellow Peril to all the smaller hardy annuals while her father brought some papers to table and presented himself as preoccupied with them
It really seems as if we shall have to put down marigolds altogether next year Aunt Molly repeated three times and do away with marguerites
They seed beyond all reason
Elizabeth the parlormaid kept coming in to hand vegetables whenever there seemed a chance of Ann Veronica asking for an interview
Directly dinner was over Mr Stanley having pretended to linger to smoke fled suddenly upstairs to petrography and when Veronica tapped he answered through the locked door Go away Vee
Im busy and made a lapidarys wheel buzz loudly
Breakfast too was an impossible occasion
He read the Times with an unusually passionate intentness and then declared suddenly for the earlier of the two trains he used
Ill come to the station said Ann Veronica
I may as well come up by this train
I may have to run said her father with an appeal to his watch
Ill run too she volunteered
Instead of which they walked sharply



I say daddy she began and was suddenly short of breath
If its about that dance project he said its no good Veronica
Ive made up my mind
Youll make me look a fool before all my friends
You shouldnt have made an engagement until youd consulted your aunt
I thought I was old enough she gasped between laughter and crying
Her fathers step quickened to a trot
I wont have you quarrelling and crying in the Avenue he said
Stop it



If youve got anything to say you must say it to your aunt But look here daddy
He flapped the Times at her with an imperious gesture
Its settled
Youre not to go
Youre NOT to go
But its about other things
I dont care
This isnt the place
Then may I come to the study tonightafter dinner
ImBUSY
Its important
If I cant talk anywhere elseI DO want an understanding
Ahead of them walked a gentleman whom it was evident they must at their present pace very speedily overtake
It was Ramage the occupant of the big house at the end of the Avenue
He had recently made Mr Stanleys acquaintance in the train and shown him one or two trifling civilities
He was an outside broker and the proprietor of a financial newspaper he had come up very rapidly in the last few years and Mr Stanley admired and detested him in almost equal measure
It was intolerable to think that he might overhear words and phrases
Mr Stanleys pace slackened
Youve no right to badger me like this Veronica he said
I cant see what possible benefit can come of discussing things that are settled
If you want advice your aunt is the person
However if you must air your opinions Tonight then daddy
He made an angry but conceivably an assenting noise and then Ramage glanced back and stopped saluted elaborately and waited for them to come up
He was a squarefaced man of nearly fifty with irongray hair a mobile cleanshaven mouth and rather protuberant black eyes that now scrutinized Ann Veronica
He dressed rather after the fashion of the West End than the City and affected a cultured urbanity that somehow disconcerted and always annoyed Ann Veronicas father extremely
He did not play golf but took his exercise on horseback which was also unsympathetic
Stuffy these trees make the Avenue said Mr Stanley as they drew alongside to account for his own ruffled and heated expression
They ought to have been lopped in the spring
Theres plenty of time said Ramage
Is Miss Stanley coming up with us
I go second she said and change at Wimbledon
Well all go second said Ramage if we may
Mr Stanley wanted to object strongly but as he could not immediately think how to put it he contented himself with a grunt and the motion was carried
Hows Mrs
Ramage
he asked
Very much as usual said Ramage
She finds lying up so much very irksome
But you see she HAS to lie up
The topic of his invalid wife bored him and he turned at once to Ann Veronica
And where are YOU going
he said
Are you going on again this winter with that scientific work of yours
Its an instance of heredity I suppose
For a moment Mr Stanley almost liked Ramage
Youre a biologist arent you
He began to talk of his own impressions of biology as a commonplace magazine reader who had to get what he could from the monthly reviews and was glad to meet with any information from nearer the fountainhead
In a little while he and she were talking quite easily and agreeably
They went on talking in the trainit seemed to her father a slight want of deference to himand he listened and pretended to read the Times
He was struck disagreeably by Ramages air of gallant consideration and Ann Veronicas selfpossessed answers
These things did not harmonize with his conception of the forthcoming if unavoidable interview
After all it came to him suddenly as a harsh discovery that she might be in a sense regarded as grownup
He was a man who in all things classified without nuance and for him there were in the matter of age just two feminine classes and no moregirls and women
The distinction lay chiefly in the right to pat their heads
But here was a girlshe must be a girl since she was his daughter and patableimitating the woman quite remarkably and cleverly
He resumed his listening
She was discussing one of those modern advanced plays with a remarkable with an extraordinary confidence
His lovemaking she remarked struck me as unconvincing
He seemed too noisy
The full significance of her words did not instantly appear to him
Then it dawned
Good heavens
She was discussing lovemaking
For a time he heard no more and stared with stony eyes at a BookWar proclamation in leaded type that filled half a column of the Times that day
Could she understand what she was talking about
Luckily it was a secondclass carriage and the ordinary fellowtravellers were not there
Everybody he felt must be listening behind their papers
Of course girls repeat phrases and opinions of which they cannot possibly understand the meaning
But a middleaged man like Ramage ought to know better than to draw out a girl the daughter of a friend and neighbor



Well after all he seemed to be turning the subject
Broddick is a heavy man he was saying and the main interest of the play was the embezzlement
Thank Heaven
Mr Stanley allowed his paper to drop a little and scrutinized the hats and brows of their three fellowtravellers 
They reached Wimbledon and Ramage whipped out to hand Miss Stanley to the platform as though she had been a duchess and she descended as though such attentions from middleaged but still gallant merchants were a matter of course
Then as Ramage readjusted himself in a corner he remarked These young people shoot up Stanley
It seems only yesterday that she was running down the Avenue all hair and legs
Mr Stanley regarded him through his glasses with something approaching animosity
Now shes all hat and ideas he said with an air of humor
She seems an unusually clever girl said Ramage
Mr Stanley regarded his neighbors cleanshaven face almost warily
Im not sure whether we dont rather overdo all this higher education he said with an effect of conveying profound meanings
Part 6 He became quite sure by a sort of accumulation of reflection as the day wore on
He found his youngest daughter intrusive in his thoughts all through the morning and still more so in the afternoon
He saw her young and graceful back as she descended from the carriage severely ignoring him and recalled a glimpse he had of her face bright and serene as his train ran out of Wimbledon
He recalled with exasperating perplexity her clear matteroffact tone as she talked about lovemaking being unconvincing
He was really very proud of her and extraordinarily angry and resentful at the innocent and audacious selfreliance that seemed to intimate her sense of absolute independence of him her absolute security without him
After all she only LOOKED a woman
She was rash and ignorant absolutely inexperienced
Absolutely
He began to think of speeches very firm explicit speeches he would make
He lunched in the Legal Club in Chancery Lane and met Ogilvy
Daughters were in the air that day
Ogilvy was full of a clients trouble in that matter a grave and even tragic trouble
He told some of the particulars
Curious case said Ogilvy buttering his bread and cutting it up in a way he had
Curious caseand sets one thinking
He resumed after a mouthful Here is a girl of sixteen or seventeen seventeen and a half to be exact running about as one might say in London
Schoolgirl
Her family are solid West End people Kensington people
Fatherdead
She goes out and comes home
Afterward goes on to Oxford
Twentyone twentytwo
Why doesnt she marry
Plenty of money under her fathers will
Charming girl
He consumed Irish stew for some moments
Married already he said with his mouth full
Shopman
Good God
said Mr Stanley
Goodlooking rascal she met at Worthing
Very romantic and all that
He fixed it
But He left her alone
Pure romantic nonsense on her part
Sheer calculation on his
Went up to Somerset House to examine the will before he did it
Yes
Nice position
She doesnt care for him now
Not a bit
What a girl of sixteen cares for is hair and a high color and moonlight and a tenor voice
I suppose most of our daughters would marry organgrinders if they had a chanceat that age
My son wanted to marry a woman of thirty in a tobacconists shop
Only a sons another story
We fixed that
Well thats the situation
My people dont know what to do
Cant face a scandal
Cant ask the gent to go abroad and condone a bigamy
He misstated her age and address but you cant get home on him for a thing like that



There you are
Girl spoilt for life
Makes one want to go back to the Oriental system
Mr Stanley poured wine
Damned Rascal
he said
Isnt there a brother to kick him
Mere satisfaction reflected Ogilvy
Mere sensuality
I rather think they have kicked him from the tone of some of the letters
Nice of course
But it doesnt alter the situation
Its these Rascals said Mr Stanley and paused
Always has been said Ogilvy
Our interest lies in heading them off
There was a time when girls didnt get these extravagant ideas
Lydia Languish for example
Anyhow they didnt run about so much
Yes
Thats about the beginning
Its these damned novels
All this torrent of misleading spurious stuff that pours from the press
These sham ideals and advanced notions
Women who Dids and all that kind of thing



Ogilvy reflected
This girlshes really a very charming frank personhad had her imagination fired so she told me by a school performance of Romeo and Juliet
Mr Stanley decided to treat that as irrelevant
There ought to be a Censorship of Books
We want it badly at the present time
Even WITH the Censorship of Plays theres hardly a decent thing to which a man can take his wife and daughters a creeping taint of suggestion everywhere
What would it be without that safeguard
Ogilvy pursued his own topic
Im inclined to think Stanley myself that as a matter of fact it was the expurgated Romeo and Juliet did the mischief
If our young person hadnt had the nurse part cut out eh
She might have known more and done less
I was curious about that
All they left it was the moon and stars
And the balcony and My Romeo
 Shakespeare is altogether different from the modern stuff
Altogether different
Im not discussing Shakespeare
I dont want to Bowdlerize Shakespeare
Im not that sort I quite agree
But this modern miasma Mr Stanley took mustard savagely
Well we wont go into Shakespeare said Ogilvy What interests me is that our young women nowadays are running about as free as air practically with registry offices and all sorts of accommodation round the corner
Nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of telling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations
And in that respect they stir up one another
Not my affair of course but I think we ought to teach them more or restrain them more
One or the other
Theyre too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom
Thats my point
Are you going to have any appletart Stanley
The appletarts been very good latelyvery good
Part 7 At the end of dinner that evening Ann Veronica began Father
Her father looked at her over his glasses and spoke with grave deliberation If there is anything you want to say to me he said you must say it in the study
I am going to smoke a little here and then I shall go to the study
I dont see what you can have to say
I should have thought my note cleared up everything
There are some papers I have to look through tonightimportant papers
I wont keep you very long daddy said Ann Veronica
I dont see Mollie he remarked taking a cigar from the box on the table as his sister and daughter rose why you and Vee shouldnt discuss this little affairwhatever it iswithout bothering me
It was the first time this controversy had become triangular for all three of them were shy by habit
He stopped in midsentence and Ann Veronica opened the door for her aunt
The air was thick with feelings
Her aunt went out of the room with dignity and a rustle and upstairs to the fastness of her own room
She agreed entirely with her brother
It distressed and confused her that the girl should not come to her
It seemed to show a want of affection to be a deliberate and unmerited disregard to justify the reprisal of being hurt
When Ann Veronica came into the study she found every evidence of a carefully foreseen grouping about the gas fire
Both armchairs had been moved a little so as to face each other on either side of the fender and in the circular glow of the greenshaded lamp there lay conspicuously waiting a thick bundle of blue and white papers tied with pink tape
Her father held some printed document in his hand and appeared not to observe her entry
Sit down he said and perusedperused is the word for itfor some moments
Then he put the paper by
And what is it all about Veronica
he asked with a deliberate note of irony looking at her a little quizzically over his glasses
Ann Veronica looked bright and a little elated and she disregarded her fathers invitation to be seated
She stood on the mat instead and looked down on him
Look here daddy she said in a tone of great reasonableness I MUST go to that dance you know
Her fathers irony deepened
Why
he asked suavely
Her answer was not quite ready
Well because I dont see any reason why I shouldnt
You see I do
Why shouldnt I go
It isnt a suitable place it isnt a suitable gathering
But daddy what do you know of the place and the gathering
And its entirely out of order it isnt right it isnt correct its impossible for you to stay in an hotel in Londonthe idea is preposterous
I cant imagine what possessed you Veronica
He put his head on one side pulled down the corners of his mouth and looked at her over his glasses
But why is it preposterous
asked Ann Veronica and fiddled with a pipe on the mantel
Surely
he remarked with an expression of worried appeal
You see daddy I dont think it IS preposterous
Thats really what I want to discuss
It comes to thisam I to be trusted to take care of myself or am I not
To judge from this proposal of yours I should say not
I think I am
As long as you remain under my roof he began and paused
You are going to treat me as though I wasnt
Well I dont think thats fair
Your ideas of fairness he remarked and discontinued that sentence
My dear girl he said in a tone of patient reasonableness you are a mere child
You know nothing of life nothing of its dangers nothing of its possibilities
You think everything is harmless and simple and so forth
It isnt
It isnt
Thats where you go wrong
In some things in many things you must trust to your elders to those who know more of life than you do
Your aunt and I have discussed all this matter
There it is
You cant go
The conversation hung for a moment
Ann Veronica tried to keep hold of a complicated situation and not lose her head
She had turned round sideways so as to look down into the fire
You see father she said it isnt only this affair of the dance
I want to go to that because its a new experience because I think it will be interesting and give me a view of things
You say I know nothing
Thats probably true
But how am I to know of things
Some things I hope you may never know he said
Im not so sure
I want to knowjust as much as I can
Tut
he said fuming and put out his hand to the papers in the pink tape
Well I do
Its just that I want to say
I want to be a human being I want to learn about things and know about things and not to be protected as something too precious for life cooped up in one narrow little corner
Cooped up
he cried
Did I stand in the way of your going to college
Have I ever prevented you going about at any reasonable hour
Youve got a bicycle
Hm
said Ann Veronica and then went on I want to be taken seriously
A girlat my ageis grownup
I want to go on with my University work under proper conditions now that Ive done the Intermediate
It isnt as though I havent done well
Ive never muffed an exam
yet
Roddy muffed two



Her father interrupted
Now look here Veronica let us be plain with each other
You are not going to that infidel Russells classes
You are not going anywhere but to the Tredgold College
Ive thought that out and you must make up your mind to it
All sorts of considerations come in
While you live in my house you must follow my ideas
You are wrong even about that mans scientific position and his standard of work
There are men in the Lowndean who laugh at himsimply laugh at him
And I have seen work by his pupils myself that struck me as beingwell next door to shameful
Theres stories too about his demonstrator Capes Something or other
The kind of man who isnt content with his science and writes articles in the monthly reviews
Anyhow there it is YOU ARE NOT GOING THERE
The girl received this intimation in silence
but the face that looked down upon the gas fire took an expression of obstinacy that brought out a hitherto latent resemblance between parent and child
When she spoke her lips twitched
Then I suppose when I have graduated I am to come home
It seems the natural course  And do nothing
There are plenty of things a girl can find to do at home
Until some one takes pity on me and marries me
He raised his eyebrows in mild appeal
His foot tapped impatiently and he took up the papers
Look here father she said with a change in her voice suppose I wont stand it
He regarded her as though this was a new idea
Suppose for example I go to this dance
You wont
Wellher breath failed her for a moment
How would you prevent it
she asked
But I have forbidden it
he said raising his voice
Yes I know
But suppose I go
Now Veronica
No no
This wont do
Understand me
I forbid it
I do not want to hear from you even the threat of disobedience
He spoke loudly
The thing is forbidden
I am ready to give up anything that you show to be wrong
You will give up anything I wish you to give up
They stared at each other through a pause and both faces were flushed and obstinate
She was trying by some wonderful secret and motionless gymnastics to restrain her tears
But when she spoke her lips quivered and they came
I mean to go to that dance
she blubbered
I mean to go to that dance
I meant to reason with you but you wont reason
Youre dogmatic
At the sight of her tears his expression changed to a mingling of triumph and concern
He stood up apparently intending to put an arm about her but she stepped back from him quickly
She produced a handkerchief and with one sweep of this and a simultaneous gulp had abolished her fit of weeping
His voice now had lost its ironies
Now Veronica he pleaded Veronica this is most unreasonable
All we do is for your good
Neither your aunt nor I have any other thought but what is best for you
Only you wont let me live
Only you wont let me exist
Mr Stanley lost patience
He bullied frankly
What nonsense is this
What raving
My dear child you DO live you DO exist
You have this home
You have friends acquaintances social standing brothers and sisters every advantage
Instead of which you want to go to some mixed classes or other and cut up rabbits and dance about at nights in wild costumes with casual art student friends and God knows who
Thatthat isnt living
You are beside yourself
You dont know what you ask nor what you say
You have neither reason nor logic
I am sorry to seem to hurt you but all I say is for your good
You MUST not you SHALL not go
On this I am resolved
I put my foot down likelike adamant
And a time will come Veronica mark my words a time will come when you will bless me for my firmness tonight
It goes to my heart to disappoint you but this thing must not be
He sidled toward her but she recoiled from him leaving him in possession of the hearthrug
Well she said goodnight father
What
he asked not a kiss
She affected not to hear
The door closed softly upon her
For a long time he remained standing before the fire staring at the situation
Then he sat down and filled his pipe slowly and thoughtfully



I dont see what else I could have said he remarked
CHAPTER THE SECOND ANN VERONICA GATHERS POINTS OF VIEW Part 1 Are you coming to the Fadden Dance Ann Veronica
asked Constance Widgett
Ann Veronica considered her answer
I mean to she replied
You are making your dress
Such as it is
They were in the elder Widgett girls bedroom Hetty was laid up she said with a sprained ankle and a miscellaneous party was gossiping away her tedium
It was a large littered selfforgetful apartment decorated with unframed charcoal sketches by various incipient masters and an open bookcase surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a human skull displayed an odd miscellany of booksShaw and Swinburne Tom Jones Fabian Essays Pope and Dumas cheek by jowl
Constance Widgetts abundant copperred hair was bent down over some dimly remunerative workstencilling in colors upon rough white materialat a kitchen table she had dragged upstairs for the purpose while on her bed there was seated a slender lady of thirty or so in a dingy green dress whom Constance had introduced with a wave of her hand as Miss Miniver
Miss Miniver looked out on the world through large emotional blue eyes that were further magnified by the glasses she wore and her nose was pinched and pink and her mouth was whimsically petulant
Her glasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face
She seemed bursting with the desire to talk and watching for her opportunity
On her lapel was an ivory button bearing the words Votes for Women
Ann Veronica sat at the foot of the sufferers bed while Teddy Widgett being something of an athlete occupied the only bedroom chaira decadent piece essentially a tripod and largely a formalityand smoked cigarettes and tried to conceal the fact that he was looking all the time at Ann Veronicas eyebrows
Teddy was the hatless young man who had turned Ann Veronica aside from the Avenue two days before
He was the junior of both his sisters coeducated and much broken in to feminine society
A bowl of roses just brought by Ann Veronica adorned the communal dressingtable and Ann Veronica was particularly trim in preparation for a call she was to make with her aunt later in the afternoon
Ann Veronica decided to be more explicit
Ive been she said forbidden to come
HulLO
said Hetty turning her head on the pillow and Teddy remarked with profound emotion My God
Yes said Ann Veronica and that complicates the situation
Auntie
asked Constance who was conversant with Ann Veronicas affairs
No
My father
Itsits a serious prohibition
Why
asked Hetty
Thats the point
I asked him why and he hadnt a reason
YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER FOR A REASON
said Miss Miniver with great intensity
Yes
I tried to have it out with him but he wouldnt have it out
Ann Veronica reflected for an instant Thats why I think I ought to come
You asked your father for a reason
Miss Miniver repeated
We always have things out with OUR father poor dear
said Hetty
Hes got almost to like it
Men said Miss Miniver NEVER have a reason
Never
And they dont know it
They have no idea of it
Its one of their worst traits one of their very worst
But I say Vee said Constance if you come and you are forbidden to come therell be the deuce of a row
Ann Veronica was deciding for further confidences
Her situation was perplexing her very much and the Widgett atmosphere was lax and sympathetic and provocative of discussion
It isnt only the dance she said
Theres the classes said Constance the wellinformed
Theres the whole situation
Apparently Im not to exist yet
Im not to study Im not to grow
Ive got to stay at home and remain in a state of suspended animation
DUSTING
said Miss Miniver in a sepulchral voice
Until you marry Vee said Hetty
Well I dont feel like standing it
Thousands of women have married merely for freedom said Miss Miniver
Thousands
Ugh
And found it a worse slavery
I suppose said Constance stencilling away at bright pink petals its our lot
But its very beastly
Whats our lot
asked her sister
Slavery
Downtroddenness
When I think of it I feel all over boot marksmens boots
We hide it bravely but so it is
Damn
Ive splashed
Miss Minivers manner became impressive
She addressed Ann Veronica with an air of conveying great open secrets to her
As things are at present she said it is true
We live under manmade institutions and that is what they amount to
Every girl in the world practically except a few of us who teach or typewrite and then were underpaid and sweatedits dreadful to think how we are sweated
She had lost her generalization whatever it was
She hung for a moment and then went on conclusively Until we have the vote that is how things WILL be
Im all for the vote said Teddy
I suppose a girl MUST be underpaid and sweated said Ann Veronica
I suppose theres no way of getting a decent incomeindependently
Women have practically NO economic freedom said Miss Miniver because they have no political freedom
Men have seen to that
The one profession the one decent profession I mean for a womanexcept the stageis teaching and there we trample on one another
Everywhere elsethe law medicine the Stock Exchangeprejudice bars us
Theres art said Ann Veronica and writing
Every one hasnt the Gift
Even there a woman never gets a fair chance
Men are against her
Whatever she does is minimized
All the best novels have been written by women and yet see how men sneer at the lady novelist still
Theres only one way to get on for a woman and that is to please men
That is what they think we are for
Were beasts said Teddy
Beasts
But Miss Miniver took no notice of his admission
Of course said Miss Minivershe went on in a regularly undulating voicewe DO please men
We have that gift
We can see round them and behind them and through them and most of us use that knowledge in the silent way we have for our great ends
Not all of us but some of us
Too many
I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask asideif we really told them what WE thought of them really showed them what WE were
A flush of excitement crept into her cheeks
Maternity she said has been our undoing
From that she opened out into a long confused emphatic discourse on the position of women full of wonderful statements while Constance worked at her stencilling and Ann Veronica and Hetty listened and Teddy contributed sympathetic noises and consumed cheap cigarettes
As she talked she made weak little gestures with her hands and she thrust her face forward from her bent shoulders and she peered sometimes at Ann Veronica and sometimes at a photograph of the Axenstrasse near Fluelen that hung upon the wall
Ann Veronica watched her face vaguely sympathizing with her vaguely disliking her physical insufficiency and her convulsive movements and the fine eyebrows were knit with a faint perplexity
Essentially the talk was a mixture of fragments of sentences heard of passages read or arguments indicated rather than stated and all of it was served in a sauce of strange enthusiasm thin yet intense
Ann Veronica had had some training at the Tredgold College in disentangling threads from confused statements and she had a curious persuasion that in all this fluent muddle there was somethingsomething real something that signified
But it was very hard to follow
She did not understand the note of hostility to men that ran through it all the bitter vindictiveness that lit Miss Minivers cheeks and eyes the sense of some at last insupportable wrong slowly accumulated
She had no inkling of that insupportable wrong
We are the species said Miss Miniver men are only incidents
They give themselves airs but so it is
In all the species of animals the females are more important than the males the males have to please them
Look at the cocks feathers look at the competition there is everywhere except among humans
The stags and oxen and things all have to fight for us everywhere
Only in man is the male made the most important
And that happens through our maternity its our very importance that degrades us
While we were minding the children they stole our rights and liberties
The children made us slaves and the men took advantage of it
Its Mrs Shalford saysthe accidental conquering the essential
Originally in the first animals there were no males none at all
It has been proved
Then they appear among the lower thingsshe made meticulous gestures to figure the scale of life she seemed to be holding up specimens and peering through her glasses at themamong crustaceans and things just as little creatures ever so inferior to the females
Mere hangers on
Things you would laugh at
And among human beings too women to begin with were the rulers and leaders they owned all the property they invented all the arts
The primitive government was the Matriarchate
The Matriarchate
The Lords of Creation just ran about and did what they were told
But is that really so
said Ann Veronica
It has been proved said Miss Miniver and added by American professors
But how did they prove it
By science said Miss Miniver and hurried on putting out a rhetorical hand that showed a slash of finger through its glove
And now look at us
See what we have become
Toys
Delicate trifles
A sex of invalids
It is we who have become the parasites and toys
It was Ann Veronica felt at once absurd and extraordinarily right
Hetty who had periods of lucid expression put the thing for her from her pillow
She charged boldly into the space of Miss Minivers rhetorical pause
It isnt quite that were toys
Nobody toys with me
Nobody regards Constance or Vee as a delicate trifle
Teddy made some confused noise a thoracic street row some remark was assassinated by a rival in his throat and buried hastily under a cough
Theyd better not said Hetty
The point is were not toys toys isnt the word were litter
Were handfuls
Were regarded as inflammable litter that mustnt be left about
We are the species and maternity is our game thats all right but nobody wants that admitted for fear we should all catch fire and set about fulfilling the purpose of our beings without waiting for further explanations
As if we didnt know
The practical trouble is our ages
They used to marry us off at seventeen rush us into things before we had time to protest
They dont now
Heaven knows why
They dont marry most of us off now until high up in the twenties
And the age gets higher
We have to hang about in the interval
Theres a great gulf opened and nobodys got any plans what to do with us
So the world is choked with waste and waiting daughters
Hanging about
And they start thinking and asking questions and begin to be neither one thing nor the other
Were partly human beings and partly females in suspense
Miss Miniver followed with an expression of perplexity her mouth shaped to futile expositions
The Widgett method of thought puzzled her weakly rhetorical mind
There is no remedy girls she began breathlessly except the Vote
Give us that Ann Veronica came in with a certain disregard of Miss Miniver
Thats it she said
They have no plans for us
They have no ideas what to do with us
Except said Constance surveying her work with her head on one side to keep the matches from the litter
And they wont let us make plans for ourselves
We will said Miss Miniver refusing to be suppressed if some of us have to be killed to get it
And she pressed her lips together in white resolution and nodded and she was manifestly full of that same passion for conflict and selfsacrifice that has given the world martyrs since the beginning of things
I wish I could make every woman every girl see this as clearly as I see itjust what the Vote means to us
Just what it means



Part 2 As Ann Veronica went back along the Avenue to her aunt she became aware of a lightfooted pursuer running
Teddy overtook her a little out of breath his innocent face flushed his strawcolored hair disordered
He was out of breath and spoke in broken sentences
I say Vee
Half a minute Vee
Its like this You want freedom
Look here
You knowif you want freedom
Just an idea of mine
You know how those Russian students do
In Russia
Just a formal marriage
Mere formality
Liberates the girl from parental control
See
You marry me
Simply
No further responsibility whatever
Without hindrancepresent occupation
Why not
Quite willing
Get a licensejust an idea of mine
Doesnt matter a bit to me
Do anything to please you Vee
Anything
Not fit to be dust on your boots
Stillthere you are
He paused
Ann Veronicas desire to laugh unrestrainedly was checked by the tremendous earnestness of his expression
Awfully good of you Teddy
she said
He nodded silently too full for words
But I dont see said Ann Veronica just how it fits the present situation
No
Well I just suggested it
Threw it out
Of course if at any timesee reasonalter your opinion
Always at your service
No offence I hope
All right
Im off
Due to play hockey
Jacksons
Horrid snorters
So long Vee
Just suggested it
See
Nothing really
Passing thought
Teddy said Ann Veronica youre a dear
Oh quite
said Teddy convulsively and lifted an imaginary hat and left her
Part 3 The call Ann Veronica paid with her aunt that afternoon had at first much the same relation to the Widgett conversation that a plaster statue of Mr Gladstone would have to a carelessly displayed interior on a dissectingroom table
The Widgetts talked with a remarkable absence of external coverings the Palsworthys found all the meanings of life on its surfaces
They seemed the most wrapped things in all Ann Veronicas wrappered world
The Widgett mental furniture was perhaps worn and shabby but there it was before you undisguised fading visibly in an almost pitiless sunlight
Lady Palsworthy was the widow of a knight who had won his spurs in the wholesale coal trade she was of good seventeenthcentury attorney blood a county family and distantly related to Aunt Mollies deceased curate
She was the social leader of Morningside Park and in her superficial and euphuistic way an extremely kind and pleasant woman
With her lived a Mrs Pramlay a sister of the Morningside Park doctor and a very active and useful member of the Committee of the Impoverished Gentlewomens Aid Society
Both ladies were on easy and friendly terms with all that was best in Morningside Park society they had an afternoon once a month that was quite well attended they sometimes gave musical evenings they dined out and gave a finish to peoples dinners they had a fullsized croquet lawn and tennis beyond and understood the art of bringing people together
And they never talked of anything at all never discussed never even encouraged gossip
They were just nice
Ann Veronica found herself walking back down the Avenue that had just been the scene of her first proposal beside her aunt and speculating for the first time in her life about that ladys mental attitudes
Her prevailing effect was one of quiet and complete assurance as though she knew all about everything and was only restrained by her instinctive delicacy from telling what she knew
But the restraint exercised by her instinctive delicacy was very great over and above coarse or sexual matters it covered religion and politics and any mention of money matters or crime and Ann Veronica found herself wondering whether these exclusions represented after all anything more than suppressions
Was there anything at all in those locked rooms of her aunts mind
Were they fully furnished and only a little dusty and cobwebby and in need of an airing or were they stark vacancy except perhaps for a cockroach or so or the gnawing of a rat
What was the mental equivalent of a rats gnawing
The image was going astray
But what would her aunt think of Teddys recent offhand suggestion of marriage
What would she think of the Widgett conversation
Suppose she was to tell her aunt quietly but firmly about the parasitic males of degraded crustacea
The girl suppressed a chuckle that would have been inexplicable
There came a wild rush of anthropological lore into her brain a flare of indecorous humor
It was one of the secret troubles of her mind this grotesque twist her ideas would sometimes take as though they rebelled and rioted
After all she found herself reflecting behind her aunts complacent visage there was a past as lurid as any onesnot of course her aunts own personal past which was apparently just that curate and almost incredibly jejune but an ancestral past with all sorts of scandalous things in it fire and slaughterings exogamy marriage by capture corroborees cannibalism
Ancestresses with perhaps dim anticipatory likenesses to her aunt their hair less neatly done no doubt their manners and gestures as yet undisciplined but still ancestresses in the direct line must have danced through a brief and stirring life in the woady buff
Was there no echo anywhere in Miss Stanleys pacified brain
Those empty rooms if they were empty were the equivalents of astoundingly decorated predecessors
Perhaps it was just as well there was no inherited memory
Ann Veronica was by this time quite shocked at her own thoughts and yet they would go on with their freaks
Great vistas of history opened and she and her aunt were near reverting to the primitive and passionate and entirely indecorous arborealwere swinging from branches by the arms and really going on quite dreadfullywhen their arrival at the Palsworthys happily checked this play of fancy and brought Ann Veronica back to the exigencies of the wrappered life again
Lady Palsworthy liked Ann Veronica because she was never awkward had steady eyes and an almost invariable neatness and dignity in her clothes
She seemed just as stiff and shy as a girl ought to be Lady Palsworthy thought neither garrulous nor unready and free from nearly all the heavy aggressiveness the overgrown overblown quality the egotism and want of consideration of the typical modern girl
But then Lady Palsworthy had never seen Ann Veronica running like the wind at hockey
She had never seen her sitting on tables nor heard her discussing theology and had failed to observe that the graceful figure was a natural one and not due to ably chosen stays
She took it for granted Ann Veronica wore staysmild stays perhaps but stays and thought no more of the matter
She had seen her really only at teas with the Stanley strain in her uppermost
There are so many girls nowadays who are quite unpresentable at tea with their untrimmed laughs their awful dispositions of their legs when they sit down their slangy disrespect they no longer smoke it is true like the girls of the eighties and nineties nevertheless to a fine intelligence they have the flavor of tobacco
They have no amenities they scratch the mellow surface of things almost as if they did it on purpose and Lady Palsworthy and Mrs Pramlay lived for amenities and the mellowed surfaces of things
Ann Veronica was one of the few young peopleand one must have young people just as one must have flowersone could ask to a little gathering without the risk of a painful discord
Then the distant relationship to Miss Stanley gave them a slight but pleasant sense of proprietorship in the girl
They had their little dreams about her
Mrs Pramlay received them in the pretty chintz drawingroom which opened by French windows on the trim garden with its croquet lawn its tennisnet in the middle distance and its remote rose alley lined with smart dahlias and flaming sunflowers
Her eye met Miss Stanleys understandingly and she was if anything a trifle more affectionate in her greeting to Ann Veronica
Then Ann Veronica passed on toward the tea in the garden which was dotted with the elite of Morningside Park society and there she was pounced upon by Lady Palsworthy and given tea and led about
Across the lawn and hovering indecisively Ann Veronica saw and immediately affected not to see Mr Manning Lady Palsworthys nephew a tall young man of sevenandthirty with a handsome thoughtful impassive face a full black mustache and a certain heavy luxuriousness of gesture
The party resolved itself for Ann Veronica into a game in which she manoeuvred unostentatiously and finally unsuccessfully to avoid talking alone with this gentleman
Mr Manning had shown on previous occasions that he found Ann Veronica interesting and that he wished to interest her
He was a civil servant of some standing and after a previous conversation upon aesthetics of a sententious nebulous and sympathetic character he had sent her a small volume which he described as the fruits of his leisure and which was as a matter of fact rather carefully finished verse
It dealt with fine aspects of Mr Mannings feelings and as Ann Veronicas mind was still largely engaged with fundamentals and found no pleasure in metrical forms she had not as yet cut its pages
So that as she saw him she remarked to herself very faintly but definitely Oh golly
and set up a campaign of avoidance that Mr Manning at last broke down by coming directly at her as she talked with the vicars aunt about some of the details of the alleged smell of the new church lamps
He did not so much cut into this conversation as loom over it for he was a tall if rather studiously stooping man
The face that looked down upon Ann Veronica was full of amiable intention
Splendid you are looking today Miss Stanley he said
How well and jolly you must be feeling
He beamed over the effect of this and shook hands with effusion and Lady Palsworthy suddenly appeared as his confederate and disentangled the vicars aunt
I love this warm end of summer more than words can tell he said
Ive tried to make words tell it
Its no good
Mild you know and boon
You want music
Ann Veronica agreed and tried to make the manner of her assent cover a possible knowledge of a probable poem
Splendid it must be to be a composer
Glorious
The Pastoral
Beethoven hes the best of them
Dont you think
Tum tay tum tay
Ann Veronica did
What have you been doing since our last talk
Still cutting up rabbits and probing into things
Ive often thought of that talk of oursoften
He did not appear to require any answer to his question
Often he repeated a little heavily
Beautiful these autumn flowers are said Ann Veronica in a wide uncomfortable pause
Do come and see the Michaelmas daisies at the end of the garden said Mr Manning theyre a dream
And Ann Veronica found herself being carried off to an isolation even remoter and more conspicuous than the corner of the lawn with the whole of the party aiding and abetting and glancing at them
Damn
said Ann Veronica to herself rousing herself for a conflict
Mr Manning told her he loved beauty and extorted a similar admission from her he then expatiated upon his own love of beauty
He said that for him beauty justified life that he could not imagine a good action that was not a beautiful one nor any beautiful thing that could be altogether bad
Ann Veronica hazarded an opinion that as a matter of history some very beautiful people had to a quite considerable extent been bad but Mr Manning questioned whether when they were bad they were really beautiful or when they were beautiful bad
Ann Veronica found her attention wandering a little as he told her that he was not ashamed to feel almost slavish in the presence of really beautiful people and then they came to the Michaelmas daisies
They were really very fine and abundant with a blaze of perennial sunflowers behind them
They make me want to shout said Mr Manning with a sweep of the arm
Theyre very good this year said Ann Veronica avoiding controversial matter
Either I want to shout said Mr Manning when I see beautiful things or else I want to weep
He paused and looked at her and said with a sudden drop into a confidential undertone Or else I want to pray
When is Michaelmas Day
said Ann Veronica a little abruptly
Heaven knows
said Mr Manning and added the twentyninth
I thought it was earlier said Ann Veronica
Wasnt Parliament to reassemble
He put out his hand and leaned against a tree and crossed his legs
Youre not interested in politics
he asked almost with a note of protest
Well rather said Ann Veronica
It seems Its interesting
Do you think so
I find my interest in that sort of thing decline and decline
Im curious
Perhaps because I dont know
I suppose an intelligent person OUGHT to be interested in political affairs
They concern us all
I wonder said Mr Manning with a baffling smile
I think they do
After all theyre history in the making
A sort of history said Mr Manning and repeated a sort of history
But look at these glorious daisies
But dont you think political questions ARE important
I dont think they are this afternoon and I dont think they are to you
Ann Veronica turned her back on the Michaelmas daisies and faced toward the house with an air of a duty completed
Just come to that seat now you are here Miss Stanley and look down the other path theres a vista of just the common sort
Better even than these
Ann Veronica walked as he indicated
You know Im oldfashioned Miss Stanley
I dont think women need to trouble about political questions
I want a vote said Ann Veronica
Really
said Mr Manning in an earnest voice and waved his hand to the alley of mauve and purple
I wish you didnt
Why not
She turned on him
It jars
It jars with all my ideas
Women to me are something so serene so fine so feminine and politics are so dusty so sordid so wearisome and quarrelsome
It seems to me a womans duty to be beautiful to BE beautiful and to behave beautifully and politics are by their very nature ugly
You see II am a woman worshipper
I worshipped women long before I found any woman I might ever hope to worship
Long ago
Andthe idea of committees of hustings of agendapapers
I dont see why the responsibility of beauty should all be shifted on to the women said Ann Veronica suddenly remembering a part of Miss Minivers discourse
It rests with them by the nature of things
Why should you who are queens come down from your thrones
If you can afford it WE cant
We cant afford to turn our women our Madonnas our Saint Catherines our Mona Lisas our goddesses and angels and fairy princesses into a sort of man
Womanhood is sacred to me
My politics in that matter wouldnt be to give women votes
Im a Socialist Miss Stanley
WHAT
said Ann Veronica startled
A Socialist of the order of John Ruskin
Indeed I am
I would make this country a collective monarchy and all the girls and women in it should be the Queen
They should never come into contact with politics or economicsor any of those things
And we men would work for them and serve them in loyal fealty
Thats rather the theory now said Ann Veronica
Only so many men neglect their duties
Yes said Mr Manning with an air of emerging from an elaborate demonstration and so each of us must under existing conditions being chivalrous indeed to all women choose for himself his own particular and worshipful queen
So far as one can judge from the system in practice said Ann Veronica speaking in a loud commonsense detached tone and beginning to walk slowly but resolutely toward the lawn it doesnt work
Every one must be experimental said Mr Manning and glanced round hastily for further horticultural points of interest in secluded corners
None presented themselves to save him from that return
Thats all very well when one isnt the material experimented upon Ann Veronica had remarked
Women wouldthey DO have far more power than they think as influences as inspirations
Ann Veronica said nothing in answer to that
You say you want a vote said Mr Manning abruptly
I think I ought to have one
Well I have two said Mr Manningone in Oxford University and one in Kensington
He caught up and went on with a sort of clumsiness Let me present you with them and be your voter
There followed an instants pause and then Ann Veronica had decided to misunderstand
I want a vote for myself she said
I dont see why I should take it secondhand
Though its very kind of you
And rather unscrupulous
Have you ever voted Mr Manning
I suppose theres a sort of place like a ticketoffice
And a ballotbox Her face assumed an expression of intellectual conflict
What is a ballotbox like exactly
she asked as though it was very important to her
Mr Manning regarded her thoughtfully for a moment and stroked his mustache
A ballotbox you know he said is very largely just a box
He made quite a long pause and went on with a sigh You have a voting paper given you They emerged into the publicity of the lawn
Yes said Ann Veronica yes to his explanation and saw across the lawn Lady Palsworthy talking to her aunt and both of them staring frankly across at her and Mr Manning as they talked
CHAPTER THE THIRD THE MORNING OF THE CRISIS Part 1 Two days after came the day of the Crisis the day of the Fadden Dance
It would have been a crisis anyhow but it was complicated in Ann Veronicas mind by the fact that a letter lay on the breakfasttable from Mr Manning and that her aunt focussed a brightly tactful disregard upon this throughout the meal
Ann Veronica had come down thinking of nothing in the world but her inflexible resolution to go to the dance in the teeth of all opposition
She did not know Mr Mannings handwriting and opened his letter and read some lines before its import appeared
Then for a time she forgot the Fadden affair altogether
With a wellsimulated unconcern and a heightened color she finished her breakfast
She was not obliged to go to the Tredgold College because as yet the College had not settled down for the session
She was supposed to be reading at home and after breakfast she strolled into the vegetable garden and having taken up a position upon the staging of a disused greenhouse that had the double advantage of being hidden from the windows of the house and secure from the sudden appearance of any one she resumed the reading of Mr Mannings letter
Mr Mannings handwriting had an air of being clear without being easily legible it was large and rather roundish with a lack of definition about the letters and a disposition to treat the large ones as liberalminded people nowadays treat opinions as all amounting to the same thing reallya yearssmoothed boyish rather than an adult hand
And it filled seven sheets of notepaper each written only on one side
MY DEAR MISS STANLEY it beganI hope you will forgive my bothering you with a letter but I have been thinking very much over our conversation at Lady Palsworthys and I feel there are things I want to say to you so much that I cannot wait until we meet again
It is the worst of talk under such social circumstances that it is always getting cut off so soon as it is beginning and I went home that afternoon feeling I had said nothingliterally nothingof the things I had meant to say to you and that were coursing through my head
They were things I had meant very much to talk to you about so that I went home vexed and disappointed and only relieved myself a little by writing a few verses
I wonder if you will mind very much when I tell you they were suggested by you
You must forgive the poets license I take
Here is one verse
The metrical irregularity is intentional because I want as it were to put you apart to change the lilt and the mood altogether when I speak of you 
A SONG OF LADIES AND MY LADY  Saintly white and a lily is Mary Margarets violets sweet and shy Green and dewy is Nelliebud fairy Forgetmenots live in Gwendolens eye
Annabel shines like a star in the darkness Rosamund queens it a rose deep rose But the lady I love is like sunshine in April weather She gleams and gladdens she warmsand goes
Crude I admit
But let that verse tell my secret
All bad verseoriginally the epigram was Langs I believeis written in a state of emotion
My dear Miss Stanley when I talked to you the other afternoon of work and politics and suchlike things my mind was all the time resenting it beyond measure
There we were discussing whether you should have a vote and I remembered the last occasion we met it was about your prospects of success in the medical profession or as a Government official such as a number of women now are and all the time my heart was crying out within me Here is the Queen of your career
I wanted as I have never wanted before to take you up to make you mine to carry you off and set you apart from all the strain and turmoil of life
For nothing will ever convince me that it is not the mans share in life to shield to protect to lead and toil and watch and battle with the world at large
I want to be your knight your servant your protector yourI dare scarcely write the wordyour husband
So I come suppliant
I am fiveandthirty and I have knocked about in the world and tasted the quality of life
I had a hard fight to begin with to win my way into the Upper DivisionI was third on a list of fortysevenand since then I have found myself promoted almost yearly in a widening sphere of social service
Before I met you I never met any one whom I felt I could love but you have discovered depths in my own nature I had scarcely suspected
Except for a few early ebullitions of passion natural to a warm and romantic disposition and leaving no harmful aftereffectsebullitions that by the standards of the higher truth I feel no one can justly cast a stone at and of which I for one am by no means ashamedI come to you a pure and unencumbered man
I love you
In addition to my public salary I have a certain private property and further expectations through my aunt so that I can offer you a life of wide and generous refinement travel books discussion and easy relations with a circle of clever and brilliant and thoughtful people with whom my literary work has brought me into contact and of which seeing me only as you have done alone in Morningside Park you can have no idea
I have a certain standing not only as a singer but as a critic and I belong to one of the most brilliant causerie dinner clubs of the day in which successful Bohemianism politicians men of affairs artists sculptors and cultivated noblemen generally mingle together in the easiest and most delightful intercourse
That is my real milieu and one that I am convinced you would not only adorn but delight in
I find it very hard to write this letter
There are so many things I want to tell you and they stand on such different levels that the effect is necessarily confusing and discordant and I find myself doubting if I am really giving you the thread of emotion that should run through all this letter
For although I must confess it reads very much like an application or a testimonial or some such thing as that I can assure you I am writing this in fear and trembling with a sinking heart
My mind is full of ideas and images that I have been cherishing and accumulatingdreams of travelling side by side of lunching quietly together in some jolly restaurant of moonlight and music and all that side of life of seeing you dressed like a queen and shining in some brilliant throngmine of your looking at flowers in some oldworld garden our gardenthere are splendid places to be got down in Surrey and a little runabout motor is quite within my means
You know they say as indeed I have just quoted already that all bad poetry is written in a state of emotion but I have no doubt that this is true of bad offers of marriage
I have often felt before that it is only when one has nothing to say that one can write easy poetry
Witness Browning
And how can I get into one brief letter the complex accumulated desires of what is now I find on reference to my diary nearly sixteen months of letting my mind run on youever since that jolly party at Surbiton where we raced and beat the other boat
You steered and I rowed stroke
My very sentences stumble and give way
But I do not even care if I am absurd
I am a resolute man and hitherto when I have wanted a thing I have got it but I have never yet wanted anything in my life as I have wanted you
It isnt the same thing
I am afraid because I love you so that the mere thought of failure hurts
If I did not love you so much I believe I could win you by sheer force of character for people tell me I am naturally of the dominating type
Most of my successes in life have been made with a sort of reckless vigor
Well I have said what I had to say stumblingly and badly and baldly
But I am sick of tearing up letters and hopeless of getting what I have to say better said
It would be easy enough for me to write an eloquent letter about something else
Only I do not care to write about anything else
Let me put the main question to you now that I could not put the other afternoon
Will you marry me Ann Veronica
Very sincerely yours HUBERT MANNING
Ann Veronica read this letter through with grave attentive eyes
Her interest grew as she read a certain distaste disappeared
Twice she smiled but not unkindly
Then she went back and mixed up the sheets in a search for particular passages
Finally she fell into reflection
Odd
she said
I suppose I shall have to write an answer
Its so different from what one has been led to expect
She became aware of her aunt through the panes of the greenhouse advancing with an air of serene unconsciousness from among the raspberry canes
No you dont
said Ann Veronica and walked out at a brisk and businesslike pace toward the house
Im going for a long tramp auntie she said
Alone dear
Yes aunt
Ive got a lot of things to think about
Miss Stanley reflected as Ann Veronica went toward the house
She thought her niece very hard and very selfpossessed and selfconfident
She ought to be softened and tender and confidential at this phase of her life
She seemed to have no idea whatever of the emotional states that were becoming to her age and position
Miss Stanley walked round the garden thinking and presently house and garden reverberated to Ann Veronicas slamming of the front door
I wonder
said Miss Stanley
For a long time she surveyed a row of towering hollyhocks as though they offered an explanation
Then she went in and upstairs hesitated on the landing and finally a little breathless and with an air of great dignity opened the door and walked into Ann Veronicas room
It was a neat efficientlooking room with a writingtable placed with a businesslike regard to the window and a bookcase surmounted by a pigs skull a dissected frog in a sealed bottle and a pile of shiny blackcovered notebooks
In the corner of the room were two hockeysticks and a tennisracket and upon the walls Ann Veronica by means of autotypes had indicated her proclivities in art
But Miss Stanley took no notice of these things
She walked straight across to the wardrobe and opened it
There hanging among Ann Veronicas more normal clothing was a skimpy dress of red canvas trimmed with cheap and tawdry braid and shortit could hardly reach below the knee
On the same peg and evidently belonging to it was a black velvet Zouave jacket
And then
a garment that was conceivably a secondary skirt
Miss Stanley hesitated and took first one and then another of the constituents of this costume off its peg and surveyed it
The third item she took with a trembling hand by its waistbelt
As she raised it its lower portion fell apart into two baggy crimson masses
TROUSERS
she whispered
Her eyes travelled about the room as if in appeal to the very chairs
Tucked under the writingtable a pair of yellow and gold Turkish slippers of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye
She walked over to them still carrying the trousers in her hands and stooped to examine them
They were ingenious disguises of gilt paper destructively gummed it would seem to Ann Veronicas best dancingslippers
Then she reverted to the trousers
How CAN I tell him
whispered Miss Stanley
Part 2 Ann Veronica carried a light but businesslike walkingstick
She walked with an easy quickness down the Avenue and through the proletarian portion of Morningside Park and crossing these fields came into a pretty overhung lane that led toward Caddington and the Downs
And then her pace slackened
She tucked her stick under her arm and reread Mannings letter
Let me think said Ann Veronica
I wish this hadnt turned up today of all days
She found it difficult to begin thinking and indeed she was anything but clear what it was she had to think about
Practically it was most of the chief interests in life that she proposed to settle in this pedestrian meditation
Primarily it was her own problem and in particular the answer she had to give to Mr Mannings letter but in order to get data for that she found that she having a logical and ordered mind had to decide upon the general relations of men to women the objects and conditions of marriage and its bearing upon the welfare of the race the purpose of the race the purpose if any of everything



Frightful lot of things arent settled said Ann Veronica
In addition the Fadden Dance business all out of proportion occupied the whole foreground of her thoughts and threw a color of rebellion over everything
She kept thinking she was thinking about Mr Mannings proposal of marriage and finding she was thinking of the dance
For a time her efforts to achieve a comprehensive concentration were dispersed by the passage of the village street of Caddington the passing of a goggled carload of motorists and the struggles of a stable lad mounted on one recalcitrant horse and leading another
When she got back to her questions again in the monotonous highroad that led up the hill she found the image of Mr Manning central in her mind
He stood there large and dark enunciating in his clear voice from beneath his large mustache clear flat sentences deliberately kindly
He proposed he wanted to possess her
He loved her
Ann Veronica felt no repulsion at the prospect
That Mr Manning loved her presented itself to her bloodlessly stilled from any imaginative quiver or thrill of passion or disgust
The relationship seemed to have almost as much to do with blood and body as a mortgage
It was something that would create a mutual claim a relationship
It was in another world from that in which men will die for a kiss and touching hands lights fires that burn up livesthe world of romance the world of passionately beautiful things
But that other world in spite of her resolute exclusion of it was always looking round corners and peeping through chinks and crannies and rustling and raiding into the order in which she chose to live shining out of pictures at her echoing in lyrics and music it invaded her dreams it wrote up broken and enigmatical sentences upon the passage walls of her mind
She was aware of it now as if it were a voice shouting outside a house shouting passionate verities in a hot sunlight a voice that cries while people talk insincerely in a darkened room and pretend not to hear
Its shouting now did in some occult manner convey a protest that Mr Manning would on no account do though he was tall and dark and handsome and kind and thirtyfive and adequately prosperous and all that a husband should be
But there was it insisted no mobility in his face no movement nothing about him that warmed
If Ann Veronica could have put words to that song they would have been Hotblooded marriage or none
but she was far too indistinct in this matter to frame any words at all
I dont love him said Ann Veronica getting a gleam
I dont see that his being a good sort matters
That really settles about that



But it means no end of a row
For a time she sat on a rail before leaving the road for the downland turf
But I wish she said I had some idea what I was really up to
Her thoughts went into solution for a time while she listened to a lark singing
Marriage and mothering said Ann Veronica with her mind crystallizing out again as the lark dropped to the nest in the turf
And all the rest of it perhaps is a song
Part 3 Her mind got back to the Fadden Ball
She meant to go she meant to go she meant to go
Nothing would stop her and she was prepared to face the consequences
Suppose her father turned her out of doors
She did not care she meant to go
She would just walk out of the house and go



She thought of her costume in some detail and with considerable satisfaction and particularly of a very jolly property dagger with large glass jewels in the handle that reposed in a drawer in her room
She was to be a Corsairs Bride
Fancy stabbing a man for jealousy
she thought
Youd have to think how to get in between his bones
She thought of her father and with an effort dismissed him from her mind
She tried to imagine the collective effect of the Fadden Ball she had never seen a fancydress gathering in her life
Mr Manning came into her thoughts again an unexpected tall dark selfcontained presence at the Fadden
One might suppose him turning up he knew a lot of clever people and some of them might belong to the class
What would he come as
Presently she roused herself with a guilty start from the task of dressing and redressing Mr Manning in fancy costume as though he was a doll
She had tried him as a Crusader in which guise he seemed plausible but heavyThere IS something heavy about him I wonder if its his mustache
and as a Hussar which made him preposterous and as a Black Brunswicker which was better and as an Arab sheik
Also she had tried him as a dragoman and as a gendarme which seemed the most suitable of all to his severely handsome immobile profile
She felt he would tell people the way control traffic and refuse admission to public buildings with invincible correctness and the very finest explicit feelings possible
For each costume she had devised a suitable form of matrimonial refusal
Oh Lord
she said discovering what she was up to and dropped lightly from the fence upon the turf and went on her way toward the crest
I shall never marry said Ann Veronica resolutely Im not the sort
Thats why its so important I should take my own line now
Part 4 Ann Veronicas ideas of marriage were limited and unsystematic
Her teachers and mistresses had done their best to stamp her mind with an ineradicable persuasion that it was tremendously important and on no account to be thought about
Her first intimations of marriage as a fact of extreme significance in a womans life had come with the marriage of Alice and the elopement of her second sister Gwen
These convulsions occurred when Ann Veronica was about twelve
There was a gulf of eight years between her and the youngest of her brace of sistersan impassable gulf inhabited chaotically by two noisy brothers
These sisters moved in a grownup world inaccessible to Ann Veronicas sympathies and to a large extent remote from her curiosity
She got into rows through meddling with their shoes and tennisrackets and had moments of carefully concealed admiration when she was privileged to see them just before her bedtime rather radiantly dressed in white or pink or amber and prepared to go out with her mother
She thought Alice a bit of a sneak an opinion her brothers shared and Gwen rather a snatch at meals
She saw nothing of their lovemaking and came home from her boardingschool in a state of decently suppressed curiosity for Alices wedding
Her impressions of this cardinal ceremony were rich and confused complicated by a quite transitory passion that awakened no reciprocal fire for a fat curly headed cousin in black velveteen and a lace collar who assisted as a page
She followed him about persistently and succeeded after a brisk unchivalrous struggle in which he pinched and asked her to cheese it in kissing him among the raspberries behind the greenhouse
Afterward her brother Roddy also strange in velveteen feeling rather than knowing of this relationship punched this Adoniss head
A marriage in the house proved to be exciting but extremely disorganizing
Everything seemed designed to unhinge the mind and make the cat wretched
All the furniture was moved all the meals were disarranged and everybody Ann Veronica included appeared in new bright costumes
She had to wear cream and a brown sash and a short frock and her hair down and Gwen cream and a brown sash and a long skirt and her hair up
And her mother looking unusually alert and hectic wore cream and brown also made up in a more complicated manner
Ann Veronica was much impressed by a mighty trying on and altering and fussing about Alices thingsAlice was being recostumed from garret to cellar with a walkingdress and walkingboots to measure and a brides costume of the most ravishing description and stockings and such like beyond the dreams of avarice and a constant and increasing dripping into the house of irrelevant remarkable objects such as Real lace bedspread Gilt travelling clock Ornamental pewter plaque Salad bowl silver mounted and servers Madgetts English Poets twelve volumes bound purple morocco Etc etc
Through all this flutter of novelty there came and went a solicitous preoccupied almost depressed figure
It was Doctor Ralph formerly the partner of Doctor Stickell in the Avenue and now with a thriving practice of his own in Wamblesmith
He had shaved his sidewhiskers and come over in flannels but he was still indisputably the same person who had attended Ann Veronica for the measles and when she swallowed the fishbone
But his role was altered and he was now playing the bridegroom in this remarkable drama
Alice was going to be Mrs Ralph
He came in apologetically all the old Well and how ARE we
note gone and once he asked Ann Veronica almost furtively Hows Alice getting on Vee
Finally on the Day he appeared like his old professional self transfigured in the most beautiful light gray trousers Ann Veronica had ever seen and a new shiny silk hat with a most becoming roll



It was not simply that all the rooms were rearranged and everybody dressed in unusual fashions and all the routines of life abolished and put away peoples tempers and emotions also seemed strangely disturbed and shifted about
Her father was distinctly irascible and disposed more than ever to hide away among the petrological thingsthe study was turned out
At table he carved in a gloomy but resolute manner
On the Day he had trumpetlike outbreaks of cordiality varied by a watchful preoccupation
Gwen and Alice were fantastically friendly which seemed to annoy him and Mrs Stanley was throughout enigmatical with an anxious eye on her husband and Alice
There was a confused impression of livery carriages and whips with white favors people fussily wanting other people to get in before them and then the church
People sat in unusual pews and a wide margin of hassocky emptiness intervened between the ceremony and the walls
Ann Veronica had a number of fragmentary impressions of Alice strangely transfigured in bridal raiment
It seemed to make her sister downcast beyond any precedent
The bridesmaids and pages got rather jumbled in the aisle and she had an effect of Alices white back and sloping shoulders and veiled head receding toward the altar
In some incomprehensible way that back view made her feel sorry for Alice
Also she remembered very vividly the smell of orange blossom and Alice drooping and spiritless mumbling responses facing Doctor Ralph while the Rev
Edward Bribble stood between them with an open book
Doctor Ralph looked kind and large and listened to Alices responses as though he was listening to symptoms and thought that on the whole she was progressing favorably
And afterward her mother and Alice kissed long and clung to each other
And Doctor Ralph stood by looking considerate
He and her father shook hands manfully
Ann Veronica had got quite interested in Mr Bribbles rendering of the servicehe had the sort of voice that brings out thingsand was still teeming with ideas about it when finally a wild outburst from the organ made it clear that whatever snivelling there might be down in the chancel that excellent wind instrument was in its Mendelssohnian way as glad as ever it could be
Pump pump perumpump Pum Pump Perum



The weddingbreakfast was for Ann Veronica a spectacle of the unreal consuming the real she liked that part very well until she was carelessly served against her expressed wishes with mayonnaise
She was caught by an uncle whose opinion she valued making faces at Roddy because he had exulted at this
Of the vast mass of these impressions Ann Veronica could make nothing at the time there they wereFact
She stored them away in a mind naturally retentive as a squirrel stores away nuts for further digestion
Only one thing emerged with any reasonable clarity in her mind at once and that was that unless she was saved from drowning by an unmarried man in which case the ceremony is unavoidable or totally destitute of under clothing and so driven to get a trousseau in which hardship a trousseau would certainly be ripping marriage was an experience to be strenuously evaded
When they were going home she asked her mother why she and Gwen and Alice had cried
Ssh
said her mother and then added A little natural feeling dear
But didnt Alice want to marry Doctor Ralph
Oh ssh Vee
said her mother with an evasion as patent as an advertisement board
I am sure she will be very happy indeed with Doctor Ralph
But Ann Veronica was by no means sure of that until she went over to Wamblesmith and saw her sister very remote and domestic and authoritative in a becoming teagown in command of Doctor Ralphs home
Doctor Ralph came in to tea and put his arm round Alice and kissed her and Alice called him Squiggles and stood in the shelter of his arms for a moment with an expression of satisfied proprietorship
She HAD cried Ann Veronica knew
There had been fusses and scenes dimly apprehended through halfopen doors
She had heard Alice talking and crying at the same time a painful noise
Perhaps marriage hurt
But now it was all over and Alice was getting on well
It reminded Ann Veronica of having a tooth stopped
And after that Alice became remoter than ever and after a time ill Then she had a baby and became as old as any really grownup person or older and very dull
Then she and her husband went off to a Yorkshire practice and had four more babies none of whom photographed well and so she passed beyond the sphere of Ann Veronicas sympathies altogether
Part 5 The Gwen affair happened when she was away at school at MarticombeonSea a term before she went to the High School and was never very clear to her
Her mother missed writing for a week and then she wrote in an unusual key
My dear the letter ran I have to tell you that your sister Gwen has offended your father very much
I hope you will always love her but I want you to remember she has offended your father and married without his consent
Your father is very angry and will not have her name mentioned in his hearing
She has married some one he could not approve of and gone right away



When the next holidays came Ann Veronicas mother was ill and Gwen was in the sickroom when Ann Veronica returned home
She was in one of her old walkingdresses her hair was done in an unfamiliar manner she wore a weddingring and she looked as if she had been crying
Hello Gwen
said Ann Veronica trying to put every one at their ease
Been and married



Whats the name of the happy man
Gwen owned to Fortescue
Got a photograph of him or anything
said Ann Veronica after kissing her mother
Gwen made an inquiry and directed by Mrs Stanley produced a portrait from its hidingplace in the jeweldrawer under the mirror
It presented a cleanshaven face with a large Corinthian nose hair tremendously waving off the forehead and more chin and neck than is good for a man
LOOKS all right said Ann Veronica regarding him with her head first on one side and then on the other and trying to be agreeable
Whats the objection
I suppose she ought to know
said Gwen to her mother trying to alter the key of the conversation
You see Vee said Mrs Stanley Mr Fortescue is an actor and your father does not approve of the profession
Oh
said Ann Veronica
I thought they made knights of actors
They may of Hal some day said Gwen
But its a long business
I suppose this makes you an actress
said Ann Veronica
I dont know whether I shall go on said Gwen a novel note of languorous professionalism creeping into her voice
The other women dont much like it if husband and wife work together and I dont think Hal would like me to act away from him
Ann Veronica regarded her sister with a new respect but the traditions of family life are strong
I dont suppose youll be able to do it much said Ann Veronica
Later Gwens trouble weighed so heavily on Mrs Stanley in her illness that her husband consented to receive Mr Fortescue in the drawingroom and actually shake hands with him in an entirely hopeless manner and hope everything would turn out for the best
The forgiveness and reconciliation was a cold and formal affair and afterwards her father went off gloomily to his study and Mr Fortescue rambled round the garden with soft propitiatory steps the Corinthian nose upraised and his hands behind his back pausing to look long and hard at the fruittrees against the wall
Ann Veronica watched him from the diningroom window and after some moments of maidenly hesitation rambled out into the garden in a reverse direction to Mr Fortescues steps and encountered him with an air of artless surprise
Hello
said Ann Veronica with arms akimbo and a careless breathless manner
You Mr
Fortescue
At your service
You Ann Veronica
Rather
I saydid you marry Gwen
Yes
Why
Mr Fortescue raised his eyebrows and assumed a lightcomedy expression
I suppose I fell in love with her Ann Veronica
Rum said Ann Veronica
Have you got to keep her now
To the best of my ability said Mr Fortescue with a bow
Have you much ability
asked Ann Veronica
Mr Fortescue tried to act embarrassment in order to conceal its reality and Ann Veronica went on to ask a string of questions about acting and whether her sister would act and was she beautiful enough for it and who would make her dresses and so on
As a matter of fact Mr Fortescue had not much ability to keep her sister and a little while after her mothers death Ann Veronica met Gwen suddenly on the staircase coming from her fathers study shockingly dingy in dusty mourning and tearful and resentful and after that Gwen receded from the Morningside Park world and not even the begging letters and distressful communications that her father and aunt received but only a vague intimation of dreadfulness a leakage of incidental comment flashes of paternal anger at that blackguard came to Ann Veronicas ears
Part 6 These were Ann Veronicas leading cases in the question of marriage
They were the only real marriages she had seen clearly
For the rest she derived her ideas of the married state from the observed behavior of married women which impressed her in Morningside Park as being tied and dull and inelastic in comparison with the life of the young and from a remarkably various reading among books
As a net result she had come to think of all married people much as one thinks of insects that have lost their wings and of her sisters as new hatched creatures who had scarcely for a moment had wings
She evolved a dim image of herself cooped up in a house under the benevolent shadow of Mr Manning
Who knowson the analogy of Squiggles she might come to call him Mangles
I dont think I can ever marry any one she said and fell suddenly into another set of considerations that perplexed her for a time
Had romance to be banished from life



It was hard to part with romance but she had never thirsted so keenly to go on with her University work in her life as she did that day
She had never felt so acutely the desire for free initiative for a life unhampered by others
At any cost
Her brothers had it practicallyat least they had it far more than it seemed likely she would unless she exerted herself with quite exceptional vigor
Between her and the fair far prospect of freedom and selfdevelopment manoeuvred Mr Manning her aunt and father neighbors customs traditions forces
They seemed to her that morning to be all armed with nets and prepared to throw them over her directly her movements became in any manner truly free
She had a feeling as though something had dropped from her eyes as though she had just discovered herself for the first timediscovered herself as a sleepwalker might do abruptly among dangers hindrances and perplexities on the verge of a cardinal crisis
The life of a girl presented itself to her as something happy and heedless and unthinking yet really guided and controlled by others and going on amidst unsuspected screens and concealments
And in its way it was very well
Then suddenly with a rush came reality came growing up a hasty imperative appeal for seriousness for supreme seriousness
The Ralphs and Mannings and Fortescues came down upon the raw inexperience upon the blinking ignorance of the newcomer and before her eyes were fairly open before she knew what had happened a new set of guides and controls a new set of obligations and responsibilities and limitations had replaced the old
I want to be a Person said Ann Veronica to the downs and the open sky I will not have this happen to me whatever else may happen in its place
Ann Veronica had three things very definitely settled by the time when a little after midday she found herself perched up on a gate between a bridlepath and a field that commanded the whole wide stretch of country between Chalking and Waldersham
Firstly she did not intend to marry at all and particularly she did not mean to marry Mr Manning secondly by some measure or other she meant to go on with her studies not at the Tredgold Schools but at the Imperial College and thirdly she was as an immediate and decisive act a symbol of just exactly where she stood a declaration of free and adult initiative going that night to the Fadden Ball
But the possible attitude of her father she had still to face
So far she had the utmost difficulty in getting on to that vitally important matter
The whole of that relationship persisted in remaining obscure
What would happen when next morning she returned to Morningside Park
He couldnt turn her out of doors
But what he could do or might do she could not imagine
She was not afraid of violence but she was afraid of something mean some secondary kind of force
Suppose he stopped all her allowance made it imperative that she should either stay ineffectually resentful at home or earn a living for herself at once



It appeared highly probable to her that he would stop her allowance
What can a girl do
Somewhere at this point Ann Veronicas speculations were interrupted and turned aside by the approach of a horse and rider
Mr Ramage that irongray man of the world appeared dressed in a bowler hat and a suit of hard gray astride of a black horse
He pulled rein at the sight of her saluted and regarded her with his rather too protuberant eyes
The girls gaze met his in interested inquiry
Youve got my view he said after a pensive second
I always get off here and lean over that rail for a bit
May I do so today
Its your gate she said amiably you got it first
Its for you to say if I may sit on it
He slipped off the horse
Let me introduce you to Caesar he said and she patted Caesars neck and remarked how soft his nose was and secretly deplored the ugliness of equine teeth
Ramage tethered the horse to the farther gatepost and Caesar blew heavily and began to investigate the hedge
Ramage leaned over the gate at Ann Veronicas side and for a moment there was silence
He made some obvious comments on the wide view warming toward its autumnal blaze that spread itself in hill and valley wood and village below
Its as broad as life said Mr Ramage regarding it and putting a wellbooted foot up on the bottom rail
Part 7 And what are you doing here young lady he said looking up at her face wandering alone so far from home
I like long walks said Ann Veronica looking down on him
Solitary walks
Thats the point of them
I think over all sorts of things
Problems
Sometimes quite difficult problems
Youre lucky to live in an age when you can do so
Your mother for instance couldnt
She had to do her thinking at homeunder inspection
She looked down on him thoughtfully and he let his admiration of her free young poise show in his face
I suppose things have changed
she said
Never was such an age of transition
She wondered what to
Mr Ramage did not know
Sufficient unto me is the change thereof he said with all the effect of an epigram
I must confess he said the New Woman and the New Girl intrigue me profoundly
I am one of those people who are interested in women more interested than I am in anything else
I dont conceal it
And the change the change of attitude
The way all the old clingingness has been thrown aside is amazing
And all the oldthe old trick of shrinking up like a snail at a touch
If you had lived twenty years ago you would have been called a Young Person and it would have been your chief duty in life not to know never to have heard of and never to understand
Theres quite enough still said Ann Veronica smiling that one doesnt understand
Quite
But your role would have been to go about saying I beg your pardon in a reproving tone to things you understood quite well in your heart and saw no harm in
That terrible Young Person
shes vanished
Lost stolen or strayed the Young Person



I hope we may never find her again
He rejoiced over this emancipation
While that lamb was about every man of any spirit was regarded as a dangerous wolf
We wore invisible chains and invisible blinkers
Now you and I can gossip at a gate and Honi soit qui mal y pense
The change has given man one good thing he never had before he said
Girl friends
And I am coming to believe the best as well as the most beautiful friends a man can have are girl friends
He paused and went on after a keen look at her I had rather gossip to a really intelligent girl than to any man alive
I suppose we ARE more free than we were
said Ann Veronica keeping the question general
Oh theres no doubt of it
Since the girls of the eighties broke bounds and sailed away on bicyclesmy young days go back to the very beginnings of thatits been one triumphant relaxation
Relaxation perhaps
But are we any more free
Well
I mean weve long strings to tether us but we are bound all the same
A woman isnt much freerin reality
Mr Ramage demurred
One runs about said Ann Veronica
Yes
But its on condition one doesnt do anything
Do what
Ohanything
He looked interrogation with a faint smile
It seems to me it comes to earning ones living in the long run said Ann Veronica coloring faintly
Until a girl can go away as a son does and earn her independent income shes still on a string
It may be a long string long enough if you like to tangle up all sorts of people but there it is
If the paymaster pulls home she must go
Thats what I mean
Mr Ramage admitted the force of that
He was a little impressed by Ann Veronicas metaphor of the string which indeed she owed to Hetty Widgett
YOU wouldnt like to be independent
he asked abruptly
I mean REALLY independent
On your own
It isnt such fun as it seems
Every one wants to be independent said Ann Veronica
Every one
Man or woman
And you
Rather
I wonder why
Theres no why
Its just to feelone owns ones self
Nobody does that said Ramage and kept silence for a moment
But a boya boy goes out into the world and presently stands on his own feet
He buys his own clothes chooses his own company makes his own way of living
Youd like to do that
Exactly
Would you like to be a boy
I wonder
Its out of the question any way
Ramage reflected
Why dont you
Well it might mean rather a row
I know said Ramage with sympathy
And besides said Ann Veronica sweeping that aspect aside what could I do
A boy sails out into a trade or profession
Butits one of the things Ive just been thinking over
Supposesuppose a girl did want to start in life start in life for herself She looked him frankly in the eyes
What ought she to do
Suppose you Yes suppose I He felt that his advice was being asked
He became a little more personal and intimate
I wonder what you could do
he said
I should think YOU could do all sorts of things



What ought you to do
He began to produce his knowledge of the world for her benefit jerkily and allusively and with a strong rank flavor of savoir faire
He took an optimist view of her chances
Ann Veronica listened thoughtfully with her eyes on the turf and now and then she asked a question or looked up to discuss a point
In the meanwhile as he talked he scrutinized her face ran his eyes over her careless gracious poise wondered hard about her
He described her privately to himself as a splendid girl
It was clear she wanted to get away from home that she was impatient to get away from home
Why
While the front of his mind was busy warning her not to fall into the hopeless miseries of underpaid teaching and explaining his idea that for women of initiative quite as much as for men the world of business had by far the best chances the back chambers of his brain were busy with the problem of that Why
His first idea as a man of the world was to explain her unrest by a lover some secret or forbidden or impossible lover
But he dismissed that because then she would ask her lover and not him all these things
Restlessness then was the trouble simple restlessness home bored her
He could quite understand the daughter of Mr Stanley being bored and feeling limited
But was that enough
Dim formless suspicions of something more vital wandered about his mind
Was the young lady impatient for experience
Was she adventurous
As a man of the world he did not think it becoming to accept maidenly calm as anything more than a mask
Warm life was behind that always even if it slept
If it was not an actual personal lover it still might be the lover not yet incarnate not yet perhaps suspected



He had diverged only a little from the truth when he said that his chief interest in life was women
It wasnt so much women as Woman that engaged his mind
His was the Latin turn of thinking he had fallen in love at thirteen and he was still capablehe prided himselfof falling in love
His invalid wife and her money had been only the thin thread that held his life together beaded on that permanent relation had been an interweaving series of other feminine experiences disturbing absorbing interesting memorable affairs
Each one had been different from the others each had had a quality all its own a distinctive freshness a distinctive beauty
He could not understand how men could live ignoring this one predominant interest this wonderful research into personality and the possibilities of pleasing these complex fascinating expeditions that began in interest and mounted to the supremest most passionate intimacy
All the rest of his existence was subordinate to this pursuit he lived for it worked for it kept himself in training for it
So while he talked to this girl of work and freedom his slightly protuberant eyes were noting the gracious balance of her limbs and body across the gate the fine lines of her chin and neck
Her grave fine face her warm clear complexion had already aroused his curiosity as he had gone to and fro in Morningside Park and here suddenly he was near to her and talking freely and intimately
He had found her in a communicative mood and he used the accumulated skill of years in turning that to account
She was pleased and a little flattered by his interest and sympathy
She became eager to explain herself to show herself in the right light
He was manifestly exerting his mind for her and she found herself fully disposed to justify his interest
She perhaps displayed herself rather consciously as a fine person unduly limited
She even touched lightly on her fathers unreasonableness
I wonder said Ramage that more girls dont think as you do and want to strike out in the world
And then he speculated
I wonder if you will
Let me say one thing he said
If ever you do and I can help you in any way by advice or inquiry or recommendation You see Im no believer in feminine incapacity but I do perceive there is such a thing as feminine inexperience
As a sex youre a little undertrainedin affairs
Id take itforgive me if I seem a little urgentas a sort of proof of friendliness
I can imagine nothing more pleasant in life than to help you because I know it would pay to help you
Theres something about you a little flavor of Will I suppose that makes one feelgood luck about you and success



And while he talked and watched her as he talked she answered and behind her listening watched and thought about him
She liked the animated eagerness of his manner
His mind seemed to be a remarkably full one his knowledge of detailed reality came in just where her own mind was most weakly equipped
Through all he said ran one quality that pleased herthe quality of a man who feels that things can be done that one need not wait for the world to push one before one moved
Compared with her father and Mr Manning and the men in fixed positions generally that she knew Ramage presented by himself had a fine suggestion of freedom of power of deliberate and sustained adventure



She was particularly charmed by his theory or friendship
It was really very jolly to talk to a man in this waywho saw the woman in her and did not treat her as a child
She was inclined to think that perhaps for a girl the converse of his method was the case an older man a man beyond the range of anything nonsensical was perhaps the most interesting sort of friend one could meet
But in that reservation it may be she went a little beyond the converse of his view



They got on wonderfully well together
They talked for the better part of an hour and at last walked together to the junction of highroad and the bridlepath
There after protestations of friendliness and helpfulness that were almost ardent he mounted a little clumsily and rode off at an amiable pace looking his best making a leg with his riding gaiters smiling and saluting while Ann Veronica turned northward and so came to Micklechesil
There in a little tea and sweetstuff shop she bought and consumed slowly and absentmindedly the insufficient nourishment that is natural to her sex on such occasions
CHAPTER THE FOURTH THE CRISIS Part 1 We left Miss Stanley with Ann Veronicas fancy dress in her hands and her eyes directed to Ann Veronicas pseudoTurkish slippers
When Mr Stanley came home at a quarter to sixan earlier train by fifteen minutes than he affectedhis sister met him in the hall with a hushed expression
Im so glad youre here Peter she said
She means to go
Go
he said
Where
To that ball
What ball
The question was rhetorical
He knew
I believe shes dressing upstairsnow
Then tell her to undress confound her
The City had been thoroughly annoying that day and he was angry from the outset
Miss Stanley reflected on this proposal for a moment
I dont think she will she said
She must said Mr Stanley and went into his study
His sister followed
She cant go now
Shell have to wait for dinner he said uncomfortably
Shes going to have some sort of meal with the Widgetts down the Avenue and go up with them
She told you that
Yes
When
At tea
But why didnt you prohibit once for all the whole thing
How dared she tell you that
Out of defiance
She just sat and told me that was her arrangement
Ive never seen her quite so sure of herself
What did you say
I said My dear Veronica
how can you think of such things
 And then
She had two more cups of tea and some cake and told me of her walk
Shell meet somebody one of these dayswalking about like that
She didnt say shed met any one
But didnt you say some more about that ball
I said everything I could say as soon as I realized she was trying to avoid the topic
I said It is no use your telling me about this walk and pretend Ive been told about the ball because you havent
Your father has forbidden you to go
 Well
She said I hate being horrid to you and father but I feel it my duty to go to that ball
 Felt it her duty
 Very well I said then I wash my hands of the whole business
Your disobedience be upon your own head
 But that is flat rebellion
said Mr Stanley standing on the hearthrug with his back to the unlit gasfire
You ought at onceyou ought at once to have told her that
What duty does a girl owe to any one before her father
Obedience to him that is surely the first law
What CAN she put before that
His voice began to rise
One would think I had said nothing about the matter
One would think I had agreed to her going
I suppose this is what she learns in her infernal London colleges
I suppose this is the sort of damned rubbish Oh
Ssh Peter
cried Miss Stanley
He stopped abruptly
In the pause a door could be heard opening and closing on the landing upstairs
Then light footsteps became audible descending the staircase with a certain deliberation and a faint rustle of skirts
Tell her said Mr Stanley with an imperious gesture to come in here
Part 2 Miss Stanley emerged from the study and stood watching Ann Veronica descend
The girl was flushed with excitement brighteyed and braced for a struggle her aunt had never seen her looking so fine or so pretty
Her fancy dress save for the greengray stockings the pseudoTurkish slippers and baggy silk trousered ends natural to a Corsairs bride was hidden in a large blacksilkhooded operacloak
Beneath the hood it was evident that her rebellious hair was bound up with red silk and fastened by some device in her ears unless she had them pierced which was too dreadful a thing to suppose
were long brass filigree earrings
Im just off aunt said Ann Veronica
Your father is in the study and wishes to speak to you
Ann Veronica hesitated and then stood in the open doorway and regarded her fathers stern presence
She spoke with an entirely false note of cheerful offhandedness
Im just in time to say goodbye before I go father
Im going up to London with the Widgetts to that ball
Now look here Ann Veronica said Mr Stanley just a moment
You are NOT going to that ball
Ann Veronica tried a less genial more dignified note
I thought we had discussed that father
You are not going to that ball
You are not going out of this house in that getup
Ann Veronica tried yet more earnestly to treat him as she would treat any man with an insistence upon her due of masculine respect
You see she said very gently I AM going
I am sorry to seem to disobey you but I am
I wishshe found she had embarked on a bad sentenceI wish we neednt have quarrelled
She stopped abruptly and turned about toward the front door
In a moment he was beside her
I dont think you can have heard me Vee he said with intensely controlled fury
I said you werehe shoutedNOT TO GO
She made and overdid an immense effort to be a princess
She tossed her head and having no further words moved toward the door
Her father intercepted her and for a moment she and he struggled with their hands upon the latch
A common rage flushed their faces
Let go
she gasped at him a blaze of anger
Veronica
cried Miss Stanley warningly and Peter
For a moment they seemed on the verge of an altogether desperate scuffle
Never for a moment had violence come between these two since long ago he had in spite of her mothers protest in the background carried her kicking and squalling to the nursery for some forgotten crime
With something near to horror they found themselves thus confronted
The door was fastened by a catch and a latch with an inside key to which at night a chain and two bolts were added
Carefully abstaining from thrusting against each other Ann Veronica and her father began an absurdly desperate struggle the one to open the door the other to keep it fastened
She seized the key and he grasped her hand and squeezed it roughly and painfully between the handle and the ward as she tried to turn it
His grip twisted her wrist
She cried out with the pain of it
A wild passion of shame and selfdisgust swept over her
Her spirit awoke in dismay to an affection in ruins to the immense undignified disaster that had come to them
Abruptly she desisted recoiled and turned and fled upstairs
She made noises between weeping and laughter as she went
She gained her room and slammed her door and locked it as though she feared violence and pursuit
Oh God
she cried Oh God
and flung aside her operacloak and for a time walked about the rooma Corsairs bride at a crisis of emotion
Why cant he reason with me she said again and again instead of doing this
Part 3 There presently came a phase in which she said I WONT stand it even now
I will go tonight
She went as far as her door then turned to the window
She opened this and scrambled outa thing she had not done for five long years of adolescenceupon the leaded space above the builtout bathroom on the first floor
Once upon a time she and Roddy had descended thence by the drainpipe
But things that a girl of sixteen may do in short skirts are not things to be done by a young lady of twentyone in fancy dress and an operacloak and just as she was coming unaided to an adequate realization of this she discovered Mr Pragmar the wholesale druggist who lived three gardens away and who had been mowing his lawn to get an appetite for dinner standing in a fascinated attitude beside the forgotten lawnmower and watching her intently
She found it extremely difficult to infuse an air of quiet correctitude into her return through the window and when she was safely inside she waved clinched fists and executed a noiseless dance of rage
When she reflected that Mr Pragmar probably knew Mr Ramage and might describe the affair to him she cried Oh
with renewed vexation and repeated some steps of her dance in a new and more ecstatic measure
Part 4 At eight that evening Miss Stanley tapped at Ann Veronicas bedroom door
Ive brought you up some dinner Vee she said
Ann Veronica was lying on her bed in a darkling room staring at the ceiling
She reflected before answering
She was frightfully hungry
She had eaten little or no tea and her midday meal had been worse than nothing
She got up and unlocked the door
Her aunt did not object to capital punishment or war or the industrial system or casual wards or flogging of criminals or the Congo Free State because none of these things really got hold of her imagination but she did object she did not like she could not bear to think of people not having and enjoying their meals
It was her distinctive test of an emotional state its interference with a kindly normal digestion
Any one very badly moved choked down a few mouthfuls the symptom of supreme distress was not to be able to touch a bit
So that the thought of Ann Veronica upstairs had been extremely painful for her through all the silent dinnertime that night
As soon as dinner was over she went into the kitchen and devoted herself to compiling a tray not a tray merely of halfcooled dinner things but a specially prepared nice tray suitable for tempting any one
With this she now entered
Ann Veronica found herself in the presence of the most disconcerting fact in human experience the kindliness of people you believe to be thoroughly wrong
She took the tray with both hands gulped and gave way to tears
Her aunt leaped unhappily to the thought of penitence
My dear she began with an affectionate hand on Ann Veronicas shoulder I do SO wish you would realize how it grieves your father
Ann Veronica flung away from her hand and the pepperpot on the tray upset sending a puff of pepper into the air and instantly filling them both with an intense desire to sneeze
I dont think you see she replied with tears on her cheeks and her brows knitting how it shames and ahdisgraces meAH TISHU
She put down the tray with a concussion on her toilettable
But dear think
He is your father
SHOOH
Thats no reason said Ann Veronica speaking through her handkerchief and stopping abruptly
Niece and aunt regarded each other for a moment over their pockethandkerchiefs with watery but antagonistic eyes each far too profoundly moved to see the absurdity of the position
I hope said Miss Stanley with dignity and turned doorward with features in civil warfare
Better state of mind she gasped



Ann Veronica stood in the twilight room staring at the door that had slammed upon her aunt her pockethandkerchief rolled tightly in her hand
Her soul was full of the sense of disaster
She had made her first fight for dignity and freedom as a grownup and independent Person and this was how the universe had treated her
It had neither succumbed to her nor wrathfully overwhelmed her
It had thrust her back with an undignified scuffle with vulgar comedy with an unendurable scornful grin
By God
said Ann Veronica for the first time in her life
But I will
I will
CHAPTER THE FIFTH THE FLIGHT TO LONDON Part 1 Ann Veronica had an impression that she did not sleep at all that night and at any rate she got through an immense amount of feverish feeling and thinking
What was she going to do
One main idea possessed her she must get away from home she must assert herself at once or perish
Very well she would say then I must go
To remain she felt was to concede everything
And she would have to go tomorrow
It was clear it must be tomorrow
If she delayed a day she would delay two days if she delayed two days she would delay a week and after a week things would be adjusted to submission forever
Ill go she vowed to the night or Ill die
She made plans and estimated means and resources
These and her general preparations had perhaps a certain disproportion
She had a gold watch a very good gold watch that had been her mothers a pearl necklace that was also pretty good some unpretending rings some silver bangles and a few other such inferior trinkets three pounds thirteen shillings unspent of her dress and book allowance and a few good salable books
So equipped she proposed to set up a separate establishment in the world
And then she would find work
For most of a long and fluctuating night she was fairly confident that she would find work she knew herself to be strong intelligent and capable by the standards of most of the girls she knew
She was not quite clear how she should find it but she felt she would
Then she would write and tell her father what she had done and put their relationship on a new footing
That was how she projected it and in general terms it seemed plausible and possible
But in between these wider phases of comparative confidence were gaps of disconcerting doubt when the universe was presented as making sinister and threatening faces at her defying her to defy preparing a humiliating and shameful overthrow
I dont care said Ann Veronica to the darkness Ill fight it
She tried to plan her proceedings in detail
The only difficulties that presented themselves clearly to her were the difficulties of getting away from Morningside Park and not the difficulties at the other end of the journey
These were so outside her experience that she found it possible to thrust them almost out of sight by saying they would be all right in confident tones to herself
But still she knew they were not right and at times they became a horrible obsession as of something waiting for her round the corner
She tried to imagine herself getting something to project herself as sitting down at a desk and writing or as returning after her work to some pleasantly equipped and free and independent flat
For a time she furnished the flat
But even with that furniture it remained extremely vague the possible good and the possible evil as well
The possible evil
Ill go said Ann Veronica for the hundredth time
Ill go
I dont care WHAT happens
She awoke out of a doze as though she had never been sleeping
It was time to get up
She sat on the edge of her bed and looked about her at her room at the row of blackcovered books and the pigs skull
I must take them she said to help herself over her own incredulity
How shall I get my luggage out of the house



The figure of her aunt a little distant a little propitiatory behind the coffee things filled her with a sense of almost catastrophic adventure
Perhaps she might never come back to that breakfastroom again
Never
Perhaps some day quite soon she might regret that breakfastroom
She helped herself to the remainder of the slightly congealed bacon and reverted to the problem of getting her luggage out of the house
She decided to call in the help of Teddy Widgett or failing him of one of his sisters
Part 2 She found the younger generation of the Widgetts engaged in languid reminiscences and all as they expressed it a bit decayed
Every one became tremendously animated when they heard that Ann Veronica had failed them because she had been as she expressed it locked in
My God
said Teddy more impressively than ever
But what are you going to do
asked Hetty
What can one do
asked Ann Veronica
Would you stand it
Im going to clear out
Clear out
cried Hetty
Go to London said Ann Veronica
She had expected sympathetic admiration but instead the whole Widgett family except Teddy expressed a common dismay
But how can you
asked Constance
Who will you stop with
I shall go on my own
Take a room
I say
said Constance
But whos going to pay for the room
Ive got money said Ann Veronica
Anything is better than thisthis stifled life down here
And seeing that Hetty and Constance were obviously developing objections she plunged at once into a demand for help
Ive got nothing in the world to pack with except a toy size portmanteau
Can you lend me some stuff
You ARE a chap
said Constance and warmed only slowly from the idea of dissuasion to the idea of help
But they did what they could for her
They agreed to lend her their holdall and a large formless bag which they called the communal trunk
And Teddy declared himself ready to go to the ends of the earth for her and carry her luggage all the way
Hetty looking out of the windowshe always smoked her afterbreakfast cigarette at the window for the benefit of the less advanced section of Morningside Park societyand trying not to raise objections saw Miss Stanley going down toward the shops
If you must go on with it said Hetty nows your time
And Ann Veronica at once went back with the holdall trying not to hurry indecently but to keep up her dignified air of being a wronged person doing the right thing at a smart trot to pack
Teddy went round by the garden backs and dropped the bag over the fence
All this was exciting and entertaining
Her aunt returned before the packing was done and Ann Veronica lunched with an uneasy sense of bag and holdall packed upstairs and inadequately hidden from chance intruders by the valance of the bed
She went down flushed and lighthearted to the Widgetts after lunch to make some final arrangements and then as soon as her aunt had retired to lie down for her usual digestive hour took the risk of the servants having the enterprise to report her proceedings and carried her bag and holdall to the garden gate whence Teddy in a state of ecstatic service bore them to the railway station
Then she went upstairs again dressed herself carefully for town put on her most businesslikelooking hat and with a wave of emotion she found it hard to control walked down to catch the 317 uptrain
Teddy handed her into the secondclass compartment her seasonticket warranted and declared she was simply splendid
If you want anything he said or get into any trouble wire me
Id come back from the ends of the earth
Id do anything Vee
Its horrible to think of you
Youre an awful brick Teddy
she said
Who wouldnt be for you
The train began to move
Youre splendid
said Teddy with his hair wild in the wind
Good luck
Good luck
She waved from the window until the bend hid him
She found herself alone in the train asking herself what she must do next and trying not to think of herself as cut off from home or any refuge whatever from the world she had resolved to face
She felt smaller and more adventurous even than she had expected to feel
Let me see she said to herself trying to control a slight sinking of the heart I am going to take a room in a lodginghouse because that is cheaper



But perhaps I had better get a room in an hotel tonight and look round



Its bound to be all right she said
But her heart kept on sinking
What hotel should she go to
If she told a cabman to drive to an hotel any hotel what would he door say
He might drive to something dreadfully expensive and not at all the quiet sort of thing she required
Finally she decided that even for an hotel she must look round and that meanwhile she would book her luggage at Waterloo
She told the porter to take it to the bookingoffice and it was only after a disconcerting moment or so that she found she ought to have directed him to go to the cloakroom
But that was soon put right and she walked out into London with a peculiar exaltation of mind an exaltation that partook of panic and defiance but was chiefly a sense of vast unexampled release
She inhaled a deep breath of airLondon air
Part 3 She dismissed the first hotels she passed she scarcely knew why mainly perhaps from the mere dread of entering them and crossed Waterloo Bridge at a leisurely pace
It was high afternoon there was no great throng of footpassengers and many an eye from omnibus and pavement rested gratefully on her fresh trim presence as she passed young and erect with the light of determination shining through the quiet selfpossession of her face
She was dressed as English girls do dress for town without either coquetry or harshness her collarless blouse confessed a pretty neck her eyes were bright and steady and her dark hair waved loosely and graciously over her ears



It seemed at first the most beautiful afternoon of all time to her and perhaps the thrill of her excitement did add a distinctive and culminating keenness to the day
The river the big buildings on the north bank Westminster and St Pauls were rich and wonderful with the soft sunshine of London the softest the finest grained the most penetrating and least emphatic sunshine in the world
The very carts and vans and cabs that Wellington Street poured out incessantly upon the bridge seemed ripe and good in her eyes
A traffic of copious barges slumbered over the face of the riverbarges either altogether stagnant or dreaming along in the wake of fussy tugs and above circled urbanely voracious the London seagulls
She had never been there before at that hour in that light and it seemed to her as if she came to it all for the first time
And this great mellow place this London now was hers to struggle with to go where she pleased in to overcome and live in
I am glad she told herself I came
She marked an hotel that seemed neither opulent nor odd in a little side street opening on the Embankment made up her mind with an effort and returning by Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo took a cab to this chosen refuge with her two pieces of luggage
There was just a minutes hesitation before they gave her a room
The young lady in the bureau said she would inquire and Ann Veronica while she affected to read the appeal on a hospital collectingbox upon the bureau counter had a disagreeable sense of being surveyed from behind by a small whiskered gentleman in a frockcoat who came out of the inner office and into the hall among a number of equally observant green porters to look at her and her bags
But the survey was satisfactory and she found herself presently in Room No
47 straightening her hat and waiting for her luggage to appear
All right so far she said to herself



Part 4 But presently as she sat on the one antimacassared red silk chair and surveyed her holdall and bag in that tidy rather vacant and dehumanized apartment with its empty wardrobe and desert toilettable and pictureless walls and stereotyped furnishings a sudden blankness came upon her as though she didnt matter and had been thrust away into this impersonal corner she and her gear



She decided to go out into the London afternoon again and get something to eat in an Aerated Bread shop or some such place and perhaps find a cheap room for herself
Of course that was what she had to do she had to find a cheap room for herself and work
This Room No
47 was no more than a sort of railway compartment on the way to that
How does one get work
She walked along the Strand and across Trafalgar Square and by the Haymarket to Piccadilly and so through dignified squares and palatial alleys to Oxford Street and her mind was divided between a speculative treatment of employment on the one hand and breezes zephyr breezesof the keenest appreciation for London on the other
The jolly part of it was that for the first time in her life so far as London was concerned she was not going anywhere in particular for the first time in her life it seemed to her she was taking London in
She tried to think how people get work
Ought she to walk into some of these places and tell them what she could do
She hesitated at the window of a shippingoffice in Cockspur Street and at the Army and Navy Stores but decided that perhaps there would be some special and customary hour and that it would be better for her to find this out before she made her attempt
And besides she didnt just immediately want to make her attempt
She fell into a pleasant dream of positions and work
Behind every one of these myriad fronts she passed there must be a career or careers
Her ideas of womens employment and a modern womans pose in life were based largely on the figure of Vivie Warren in Mrs Warrens Profession
She had seen Mrs Warrens Profession furtively with Hetty Widgett from the gallery of a Stage Society performance one Monday afternoon
Most of it had been incomprehensible to her or comprehensible in a way that checked further curiosity but the figure of Vivien hard capable successful and bullying and ordering about a veritable Teddy in the person of Frank Gardner appealed to her
She saw herself in very much Vivies positionmanaging something
Her thoughts were deflected from Vivie Warren by the peculiar behavior of a middleaged gentleman in Piccadilly
He appeared suddenly from the infinite in the neighborhood of the Burlington Arcade crossing the pavement toward her and with his eyes upon her
He seemed to her indistinguishably about her fathers age
He wore a silk hat a little tilted and a morning coat buttoned round a tight contained figure and a white slip gave a finish to his costume and endorsed the quiet distinction of his tie
His face was a little flushed perhaps and his small brown eyes were bright
He stopped on the curbstone not facing her but as if he was on his way to cross the road and spoke to her suddenly over his shoulder
Whither away
he said very distinctly in a curiously wheedling voice
Ann Veronica stared at his foolish propitiatory smile his hungry gaze through one moment of amazement then stepped aside and went on her way with a quickened step
But her mind was ruffled and its mirrorlike surface of satisfaction was not easily restored
Queer old gentleman
The art of ignoring is one of the accomplishments of every wellbred girl so carefully instilled that at last she can even ignore her own thoughts and her own knowledge
Ann Veronica could at the same time ask herself what this queer old gentleman could have meant by speaking to her and knowknow in general terms at leastwhat that accosting signified
About her as she had gone day by day to and from the Tredgold College she had seen and not seen many an incidental aspect of those sides of life about which girls are expected to know nothing aspects that were extraordinarily relevant to her own position and outlook on the world and yet by convention ineffably remote
For all that she was of exceptional intellectual enterprise she had never yet considered these things with unaverted eyes
She had viewed them askance and without exchanging ideas with any one else in the world about them
She went on her way now no longer dreaming and appreciative but disturbed and unwillingly observant behind her mask of serene contentment
That delightful sense of free unembarrassed movement was gone
As she neared the bottom of the dip in Piccadilly she saw a woman approaching her from the opposite directiona tall woman who at the first glance seemed altogether beautiful and fine
She came along with the fluttering assurance of some tall ship
Then as she drew nearer paint showed upon her face and a harsh purpose behind the quiet expression of her open countenance and a sort of unreality in her splendor betrayed itself for which Ann Veronica could not recall the right word a word half understood that lurked and hid in her mind the word meretricious
Behind this woman and a little to the side of her walked a man smartly dressed with desire and appraisal in his eyes
Something insisted that those two were mysteriously linkedthat the woman knew the man was there
It was a second reminder that against her claim to go free and untrammelled there was a case to be made that after all it was true that a girl does not go alone in the world unchallenged nor ever has gone freely alone in the world that evil walks abroad and dangers and petty insults more irritating than dangers lurk
It was in the quiet streets and squares toward Oxford Street that it first came into her head disagreeably that she herself was being followed
She observed a man walking on the opposite side of the way and looking toward her
Bother it all
she swore
Bother
and decided that this was not so and would not look to right or left again
Beyond the Circus Ann Veronica went into a British TeaTable Company shop to get some tea
And as she was yet waiting for her tea to come she saw this man again
Either it was an unfortunate recovery of a trail or he had followed her from Mayfair
There was no mistaking his intentions this time
He came down the shop looking for her quite obviously and took up a position on the other side against a mirror in which he was able to regard her steadfastly
Beneath the serene unconcern of Ann Veronicas face was a boiling tumult
She was furiously angry
She gazed with a quiet detachment toward the window and the Oxford Street traffic and in her heart she was busy kicking this man to death
He HAD followed her
What had he followed her for
He must have followed her all the way from beyond Grosvenor Square
He was a tall man and fair with bluish eyes that were rather protuberant and long white hands of which he made a display
He had removed his silk hat and now sat looking at Ann Veronica over an untouched cup of tea he sat gloating upon her trying to catch her eye
Once when he thought he had done so he smiled an ingratiating smile
He moved after quiet intervals with a quick little movement and ever and again stroked his small mustache and coughed a selfconscious cough
That he should be in the same world with me
said Ann Veronica reduced to reading the list of good things the British TeaTable Company had priced for its patrons
Heaven knows what dim and tawdry conceptions of passion and desire were in that blond cranium what romancebegotten dreams of intrigue and adventure
but they sufficed when presently Ann Veronica went out into the darkling street again to inspire a flitting dogged pursuit idiotic exasperating indecent
She had no idea what she should do
If she spoke to a policeman she did not know what would ensue
Perhaps she would have to charge this man and appear in a policecourt next day
She became angry with herself
She would not be driven in by this persistent sneaking aggression
She would ignore him
Surely she could ignore him
She stopped abruptly and looked in a flowershop window
He passed and came loitering back and stood beside her silently looking into her face
The afternoon had passed now into twilight
The shops were lighting up into gigantic lanterns of color the street lamps were glowing into existence and she had lost her way
She had lost her sense of direction and was among unfamiliar streets
She went on from street to street and all the glory of London had departed
Against the sinister the threatening monstrous inhumanity of the limitless city there was nothing now but this supreme ugly fact of a pursuitthe pursuit of the undesired persistent male
For a second time Ann Veronica wanted to swear at the universe
There were moments when she thought of turning upon this man and talking to him
But there was something in his face at once stupid and invincible that told her he would go on forcing himself upon her that he would esteem speech with her a great point gained
In the twilight he had ceased to be a person one could tackle and shame he had become something more general a something that crawled and sneaked toward her and would not let her alone



Then when the tension was getting unendurable and she was on the verge of speaking to some casual passerby and demanding help her follower vanished
For a time she could scarcely believe he was gone
He had
The night had swallowed him up but his work on her was done
She had lost her nerve and there was no more freedom in London for her that night
She was glad to join in the stream of hurrying homeward workers that was now welling out of a thousand places of employment and to imitate their driven preoccupied haste
She had followed a bobbing white hat and gray jacket until she reached the Euston Road corner of Tottenham Court Road and there by the name on a bus and the cries of a conductor she made a guess of her way
And she did not merely affect to be drivenshe felt driven
She was afraid people would follow her she was afraid of the dark open doorways she passed and afraid of the blazes of light she was afraid to be alone and she knew not what it was she feared
It was past seven when she got back to her hotel
She thought then that she had shaken off the man of the bulging blue eyes forever but that night she found he followed her into her dreams
He stalked her he stared at her he craved her he sidled slinking and propitiatory and yet relentlessly toward her until at last she awoke from the suffocating nightmare nearness of his approach and lay awake in fear and horror listening to the unaccustomed sounds of the hotel
She came very near that night to resolving that she would return to her home next morning
But the morning brought courage again and those first intimations of horror vanished completely from her mind
Part 5 She had sent her father a telegram from the East Strand postoffice worded thus  All  is  well  with  me    and  quite  safe  Veronica    and afterward she had dined a la carte upon a cutlet and had then set herself to write an answer to Mr Mannings proposal of marriage
But she had found it very difficult
DEAR MR MANNING she had begun
So far it had been plain sailing and it had seemed fairly evident to go on I find it very difficult to answer your letter
But after that neither ideas nor phrases had come and she had fallen thinking of the events of the day
She had decided that she would spend the next morning answering advertisements in the papers that abounded in the writingroom and so after half an hours perusal of back numbers of the Sketch in the drawingroom she had gone to bed
She found next morning when she came to this advertisement answering that it was more difficult than she had supposed
In the first place there were not so many suitable advertisements as she had expected
She sat down by the paperrack with a general feeling of resemblance to Vivie Warren and looked through the Morning Post and Standard and Telegraph and afterward the halfpenny sheets
The Morning Post was hungry for governesses and nursery governesses but held out no other hopes the Daily Telegraph that morning seemed eager only for skirt hands
She went to a writingdesk and made some memoranda on a sheet of notepaper and then remembered that she had no address as yet to which letters could be sent
She decided to leave this matter until the morrow and devote the morning to settling up with Mr Manning
At the cost of quite a number of torn drafts she succeeded in evolving this DEAR MR MANNINGI find it very difficult to answer your letter
I hope you wont mind if I say first that I think it does me an extraordinary honor that you should think of any one like myself so highly and seriously and secondly that I wish it had not been written
She surveyed this sentence for some time before going on
I wonder she said why one writes him sentences like that
Itll have to go she decided Ive written too many already
She went on with a desperate attempt to be easy and colloquial You see we were rather good friends I thought and now perhaps it will be difficult for us to get back to the old friendly footing
But if that can possibly be done I want it to be done
You see the plain fact of the case is that I think I am too young and ignorant for marriage
I have been thinking these things over lately and it seems to me that marriage for a girl is just the supremest thing in life
It isnt just one among a number of important things for her it is the important thing and until she knows far more than I know of the facts of life how is she to undertake it
So please if you will forget that you wrote that letter and forgive this answer
I want you to think of me just as if I was a man and quite outside marriage altogether
I do hope you will be able to do this because I value men friends
I shall be very sorry if I cannot have you for a friend
I think that there is no better friend for a girl than a man rather older than herself
Perhaps by this time you will have heard of the step I have taken in leaving my home
Very likely you will disapprove highly of what I have donel wonder
You may perhaps think I have done it just in a fit of childish petulance because my father locked me in when I wanted to go to a ball of which he did not approve
But really it is much more than that
At Morningside Park I feel as though all my growing up was presently to stop as though I was being shut in from the light of life and as they say in botany etiolated
I was just like a sort of dummy that does things as it is toldthat is to say as the strings are pulled
I want to be a person by myself and to pull my own strings
I had rather have trouble and hardship like that than be taken care of by others
I want to be myself
l wonder if a man can quite understand that passionate feeling
It is quite a passionate feeling
So I am already no longer the girl you knew at Morningside Park
I am a young person seeking employment and freedom and selfdevelopment just as in quite our first talk of all I said I wanted to be
I do hope you will see how things are and not be offended with me or frightfully shocked and distressed by what I have done
Very sincerely yours ANN VERONICA STANLEY
Part 6 In the afternoon she resumed her search for apartments
The intoxicating sense of novelty had given place to a more businesslike mood
She drifted northward from the Strand and came on some queer and dingy quarters
She had never imagined life was half so sinister as it looked to her in the beginning of these investigations
She found herself again in the presence of some element in life about which she had been trained not to think about which she was perhaps instinctively indisposed to think something which jarred in spite of all her mental resistance with all her preconceptions of a clean and courageous girl walking out from Morningside Park as one walks out of a cell into a free and spacious world
One or two landladies refused her with an air of conscious virtue that she found hard to explain
We dont let to ladies they said
She drifted via Theobalds Road obliquely toward the region about Titchfield Street
Such apartments as she saw were either scandalously dirty or unaccountably dear or both
And some were adorned with engravings that struck her as being more vulgar and undesirable than anything she had ever seen in her life
Ann Veronica loved beautiful things and the beauty of undraped loveliness not least among them but these were pictures that did but insist coarsely upon the roundness of womens bodies
The windows of these rooms were obscured with draperies their floors a carpet patchwork the china ornaments on their mantels were of a class apart
After the first onset several of the women who had apartments to let said she would not do for them and in effect dismissed her
This also struck her as odd
About many of these houses hung a mysterious taint as of something weakly and commonly and dustily evil the women who negotiated the rooms looked out through a friendly manner as though it was a mask with hard defiant eyes
Then one old crone shortsighted and shakyhanded called Ann Veronica dearie and made some remark obscure and slangy of which the spirit rather than the words penetrated to her understanding
For a time she looked at no more apartments and walked through gaunt and illcleaned streets through the sordid under side of life perplexed and troubled ashamed of her previous obtuseness
She had something of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has been into surroundings or touched something that offends his caste
She passed people in the streets and regarded them with a quickening apprehension once or twice came girls dressed in slatternly finery going toward Regent Street from out these places
It did not occur to her that they at least had found a way of earning a living and had that much economic superiority to herself
It did not occur to her that save for some accidents of education and character they had souls like her own
For a time Ann Veronica went on her way gauging the quality of sordid streets
At last a little way to the northward of Euston Road the moral cloud seemed to lift the moral atmosphere to change clean blinds appeared in the windows clean doorsteps before the doors a different appeal in the neatly placed cards bearing the word   APARTMENTS   in the clear bright windows
At last in a street near the Hampstead Road she hit upon a room that had an exceptional quality of space and order and a tall woman with a kindly face to show it
Youre a student perhaps
said the tall woman
At the Tredgold Womens College said Ann Veronica
She felt it would save explanations if she did not state she had left her home and was looking for employment
The room was papered with green largepatterned paper that was at worst a trifle dingy and the armchair and the seats of the other chairs were covered with the unusual brightness of a largepatterned chintz which also supplied the windowcurtain
There was a round table covered not with the usual tapestry cover but with a plain green cloth that went passably with the wallpaper
In the recess beside the fireplace were some open bookshelves
The carpet was a quiet drugget and not excessively worn and the bed in the corner was covered by a white quilt
There were neither texts nor rubbish on the walls but only a stirring version of Belshazzars feast a steel engraving in the early Victorian manner that had some satisfactory blacks
And the woman who showed this room was tall with an understanding eye and the quiet manner of the welltrained servant
Ann Veronica brought her luggage in a cab from the hotel she tipped the hotel porter sixpence and overpaid the cabman eighteenpence unpacked some of her books and possessions and so made the room a little homelike and then sat down in a by no means uncomfortable armchair before the fire
She had arranged for a supper of tea a boiled egg and some tinned peaches
She had discussed the general question of supplies with the helpful landlady
And now said Ann Veronica surveying her apartment with an unprecedented sense of proprietorship what is the next step
She spent the evening in writingit was a little difficultto her father andwhich was easierto the Widgetts
She was greatly heartened by doing this
The necessity of defending herself and assuming a confident and secure tone did much to dispell the sense of being exposed and indefensible in a huge dingy world that abounded in sinister possibilities
She addressed her letters meditated on them for a time and then took them out and posted them
Afterward she wanted to get her letter to her father back in order to read it over again and if it tallied with her general impression of it rewrite it
He would know her address tomorrow
She reflected upon that with a thrill of terror that was also somehow in some faint remote way gleeful
Dear old Daddy she said hell make a fearful fuss
Well it had to happen somewhen



Somehow
I wonder what hell say
CHAPTER THE SIXTH EXPOSTULATIONS Part 1 The next morning opened calmly and Ann Veronica sat in her own room her very own room and consumed an egg and marmalade and read the advertisements in the Daily Telegraph
Then began expostulations preluded by a telegram and headed by her aunt
The telegram reminded Ann Veronica that she had no place for interviews except her bedsittingroom and she sought her landlady and negotiated hastily for the use of the ground floor parlor which very fortunately was vacant
She explained she was expecting an important interview and asked that her visitor should be duly shown in
Her aunt arrived about halfpast ten in black and with an unusually thick spotted veil
She raised this with the air of a conspirator unmasking and displayed a tearflushed face
For a moment she remained silent
My dear she said when she could get her breath you must come home at once
Ann Veronica closed the door quite softly and stood still
This has almost killed your father



After Gwen
I sent a telegram
He cares so much for you
He did so care for you
I sent a telegram to say I was all right
All right
And I never dreamed anything of the sort was going on
I had no idea
She sat down abruptly and threw her wrists limply upon the table
Oh Veronica
she said to leave your home
She had been weeping
She was weeping now
Ann Veronica was overcome by this amount of emotion
Why did you do it
her aunt urged
Why could you not confide in us
Do what
said Ann Veronica
What you have done
But what have I done
Elope
Go off in this way
We had no idea
We had such a pride in you such hope in you
I had no idea you were not the happiest girl
Everything I could do
Your father sat up all night
Until at last I persuaded him to go to bed
He wanted to put on his overcoat and come after you and look for youin London
We made sure it was just like Gwen
Only Gwen left a letter on the pincushion
You didnt even do that Vee not even that
I sent a telegram aunt said Ann Veronica
Like a stab
You didnt even put the twelve words
I said I was all right
Gwen said she was happy
Before that came your father didnt even know you were gone
He was just getting cross about your being late for dinneryou know his waywhen it came
He opened itjust offhand and then when he saw what it was he hit at the table and sent his soup spoon flying and splashing on to the tablecloth
My God
he said Ill go after them and kill him
Ill go after them and kill him
For the moment I thought it was a telegram from Gwen
But what did father imagine
Of course he imagined
Any one would
What has happened Peter
I asked
He was standing up with the telegram crumpled in his hand
He used a most awful word
Then he said Its Ann Veronica gone to join her sister
Gone
I said
Gone
he said
Read that and threw the telegram at me so that it went into the tureen
He swore when I tried to get it out with the ladle and told me what it said
Then he sat down again in a chair and said that people who wrote novels ought to be strung up
It was as much as I could do to prevent him flying out of the house there and then and coming after you
Never since I was a girl have I seen your father so moved
Oh
little Vee
he cried little Vee
and put his face between his hands and sat still for a long time before he broke out again
Ann Veronica had remained standing while her aunt spoke
Do you mean aunt she asked that my father thought I had gone offwith some man
What else COULD he think
Would any one DREAM you would be so mad as to go off alone
Afterafter what had happened the night before
Oh why raise up old scores
If you could see him this morning his poor face as white as a sheet and all cut about with shaving
He was for coming up by the very first train and looking for you but I said to him Wait for the letters and there sure enough was yours
He could hardly open the envelope he trembled so
Then he threw the letter at me
Go and fetch her home he said it isnt what we thought
Its just a practical joke of hers
And with that he went off to the City stern and silent leaving his bacon on his platea great slice of bacon hardly touched
No breakfast hes had no dinner hardly a mouthful of soupsince yesterday at tea
She stopped
Aunt and niece regarded each other silently
You must come home to him at once said Miss Stanley
Ann Veronica looked down at her fingers on the claretcolored tablecloth
Her aunt had summoned up an altogether too vivid picture of her father as the masterful man overbearing emphatic sentimental noisy aimless
Why on earth couldnt he leave her to grow in her own way
Her pride rose at the bare thought of return I dont think I CAN do that she said
She looked up and said a little breathlessly Im sorry aunt but I dont think I can
Part 2 Then it was the expostulations really began
From first to last on this occasion her aunt expostulated for about two hours
But my dear she began it is Impossible
It is quite out of the Question
You simply cant
And to that through vast rhetorical meanderings she clung
It reached her only slowly that Ann Veronica was standing to her resolution
How will you live
she appealed
Think of what people will say
That became a refrain
Think of what Lady Palsworthy will say
Think of whatSoandsowill say
What are we to tell people
Besides what am I to tell your father
At first it had not been at all clear to Ann Veronica that she would refuse to return home she had had some dream of a capitulation that should leave her an enlarged and defined freedom but as her aunt put this aspect and that of her flight to her as she wandered illogically and inconsistently from one urgent consideration to another as she mingled assurances and aspects and emotions it became clearer and clearer to the girl that there could be little or no change in the position of things if she returned
And what will Mr Manning think
said her aunt
I dont care what any one thinks said Ann Veronica
I cant imagine what has come over you said her aunt
I cant conceive what you want
You foolish girl
Ann Veronica took that in silence
At the back of her mind dim and yet disconcerting was the perception that she herself did not know what she wanted
And yet she knew it was not fair to call her a foolish girl
Dont you care for Mr
Manning
said her aunt
I dont see what he has to do with my coming to London
Hehe worships the ground you tread on
You dont deserve it but he does
Or at least he did the day before yesterday
And here you are
Her aunt opened all the fingers of her gloved hand in a rhetorical gesture
It seems to me all madnessmadness
Just because your fatherwouldnt let you disobey him
Part 3 In the afternoon the task of expostulation was taken up by Mr Stanley in person
Her fathers ideas of expostulation were a little harsh and forcible and over the claretcolored tablecloth and under the gas chandelier with his hat and umbrella between them like the mace in Parliament he and his daughter contrived to have a violent quarrel
She had intended to be quietly dignified but he was in a smouldering rage from the beginning and began by assuming which alone was more than flesh and blood could stand that the insurrection was over and that she was coming home submissively
In his desire to be emphatic and to avenge himself for his overnight distresses he speedily became brutal more brutal than she had ever known him before
A nice time of anxiety youve given me young lady he said as he entered the room
I hope youre satisfied
She was frightenedhis anger always did frighten herand in her resolve to conceal her fright she carried a queenlike dignity to what she felt even at the time was a preposterous pitch
She said she hoped she had not distressed him by the course she had felt obliged to take and he told her not to be a fool
She tried to keep her side up by declaring that he had put her into an impossible position and he replied by shouting Nonsense
Nonsense
Any father in my place would have done what I did
Then he went on to say Well youve had your little adventure and I hope now youve had enough of it
So go upstairs and get your things together while I look out for a hansom
To which the only possible reply seemed to be Im not coming home
Not coming home
No
And in spite of her resolve to be a Person Ann Veronica began to weep with terror at herself
Apparently she was always doomed to weep when she talked to her father
But he was always forcing her to say and do such unexpectedly conclusive things
She feared he might take her tears as a sign of weakness
So she said I wont come home
Id rather starve
For a moment the conversation hung upon that declaration
Then Mr Stanley putting his hands on the table in the manner rather of a barrister than a solicitor and regarding her balefully through his glasses with quite undisguised animosity asked And may I presume to inquire then what you mean to dohow do you propose to live
I shall live sobbed Ann Veronica
You neednt be anxious about that
I shall contrive to live
But I AM anxious said Mr Stanley I am anxious
Do you think its nothing to me to have my daughter running about London looking for odd jobs and disgracing herself
Shant get odd jobs said Ann Veronica wiping her eyes
And from that point they went on to a thoroughly embittering wrangle
Mr Stanley used his authority and commanded Ann Veronica to come home to which of course she said she wouldnt and then he warned her not to defy him warned her very solemnly and then commanded her again
He then said that if she would not obey him in this course she should never darken his doors again and was indeed frightfully abusive
This threat terrified Ann Veronica so much that she declared with sobs and vehemence that she would never come home again and for a time both talked at once and very wildly
He asked her whether she understood what she was saying and went on to say still more precisely that she should never touch a penny of his money until she came home againnot one penny
Ann Veronica said she didnt care
Then abruptly Mr Stanley changed his key
You poor child
he said dont you see the infinite folly of these proceedings
Think
Think of the love and affection you abandon
Think of your aunt a second mother to you
Think if your own mother was alive
He paused deeply moved
If my own mother was alive sobbed Ann Veronica she would understand
The talk became more and more inconclusive and exhausting
Ann Veronica found herself incompetent undignified and detestable holding on desperately to a hardening antagonism to her father quarrelling with him wrangling with him thinking of reparteesalmost as if he was a brother
It was horrible but what could she do
She meant to live her own life and he meant with contempt and insults to prevent her
Anything else that was said she now regarded only as an aspect of or diversion from that
In the retrospect she was amazed to think how things had gone to pieces for at the outset she had been quite prepared to go home again upon terms
While waiting for his coming she had stated her present and future relations with him with what had seemed to her the most satisfactory lucidity and completeness
She had looked forward to an explanation
Instead had come this storm this shouting this weeping this confusion of threats and irrelevant appeals
It was not only that her father had said all sorts of inconsistent and unreasonable things but that by some incomprehensible infection she herself had replied in the same vein
He had assumed that her leaving home was the point at issue that everything turned on that and that the sole alternative was obedience and she had fallen in with that assumption until rebellion seemed a sacred principle
Moreover atrociously and inexorably he allowed it to appear ever and again in horrible gleams that he suspected there was some man in the case



Some man
And to conclude it all was the figure of her father in the doorway giving her a last chance his hat in one hand his umbrella in the other shaken at her to emphasize his point
You understand then he was saying you understand
I understand said Ann Veronica tearwet and flushed with a reciprocal passion but standing up to him with an equality that amazed even herself I understand
She controlled a sob
Not a pennynot one pennyand never darken your doors again
Part 4 The next day her aunt came again and expostulated and was just saying it was an unheardof thing for a girl to leave her home as Ann Veronica had done when her father arrived and was shown in by the pleasantfaced landlady
Her father had determined on a new line
He put down his hat and umbrella rested his hands on his hips and regarded Ann Veronica firmly
Now he said quietly its time we stopped this nonsense
Ann Veronica was about to reply when he went on with a still more deadly quiet I am not here to bandy words with you
Let us have no more of this humbug
You are to come home
I thought I explained I dont think you can have heard me said her father I have told you to come home
I thought I explained Come home
Ann Veronica shrugged her shoulders
Very well said her father
I think this ends the business he said turning to his sister
Its not for us to supplicate any more
She must learn wisdomas God pleases
But my dear Peter
said Miss Stanley
No said her brother conclusively its not for a parent to go on persuading a child
Miss Stanley rose and regarded Ann Veronica fixedly
The girl stood with her hands behind her back sulky resolute and intelligent a strand of her black hair over one eye and looking more than usually delicatefeatured and more than ever like an obdurate child
She doesnt know
She does
I cant imagine what makes you fly out against everything like this said Miss Stanley to her niece
What is the good of talking
said her brother
She must go her own way
A mans children nowadays are not his own
Thats the fact of the matter
Their minds are turned against him



Rubbishy novels and pernicious rascals
We cant even protect them from themselves
An immense gulf seemed to open between father and daughter as he said these words
I dont see gasped Ann Veronica why parents and children 


shouldnt be friends
Friends
said her father
When we see you going through disobedience to the devil
Come Molly she must go her own way
Ive tried to use my authority
And she defies me
What more is there to be said
She defies me
It was extraordinary
Ann Veronica felt suddenly an effect of tremendous pathos she would have given anything to have been able to frame and make some appeal some utterance that should bridge this bottomless chasm that had opened between her and her father and she could find nothing whatever to say that was in the least sincere and appealing
Father she cried I have to live
He misunderstood her
That he said grimly with his hand on the doorhandle must be your own affair unless you choose to live at Morningside Park
Miss Stanley turned to her
Vee she said come home
Before it is too late
Come Molly said Mr Stanley at the door
Vee
said Miss Stanley you hear what your father says
Miss Stanley struggled with emotion
She made a curious movement toward her niece then suddenly convulsively she dabbed down something lumpy on the table and turned to follow her brother
Ann Veronica stared for a moment in amazement at this darkgreen object that clashed as it was put down
It was a purse
She made a step forward
Aunt
she said I cant Then she caught a wild appeal in her aunts blue eye halted and the door clicked upon them
There was a pause and then the front door slammed



Ann Veronica realized that she was alone with the world
And this time the departure had a tremendous effect of finality
She had to resist an impulse of sheer terror to run out after them and give in
Gods she said at last Ive done it this time
Well
She took up the neat morocco purse opened it and examined the contents
It contained three sovereigns six and fourpence two postage stamps a small key and her aunts return half ticket to Morningside Park
Part 5 After the interview Ann Veronica considered herself formally cut off from home
If nothing else had clinched that the purse had
Nevertheless there came a residuum of expostulations
Her brother Roddy who was in the motor line came to expostulate her sister Alice wrote
And Mr Manning called
Her sister Alice seemed to have developed a religious sense away there in Yorkshire and made appeals that had no meaning for Ann Veronicas mind
She exhorted Ann Veronica not to become one of those unsexed intellectuals neither man nor woman
Ann Veronica meditated over that phrase
Thats HIM said Ann Veronica in sound idiomatic English
Poor old Alice
Her brother Roddy came to her and demanded tea and asked her to state a case
Bit thick on the old man isnt it
said Roddy who had developed a bluff straightforward style in the motor shop
Mind my smoking
said Roddy
I dont see quite what your game is Vee but I suppose youve got a game on somewhere
Rummy lot we are
said Roddy
AliceAlice gone dotty and all over kids
GwenI saw Gwen the other day and the paints thicker than ever
Jim is up to the neck in Mahatmas and Theosophy and Higher Thought and rotwrites letters worse than Alice
And now YOURE on the warpath
I believe Im the only sane member of the family left
The GV
s as mad as any of you in spite of all his respectability not a bit of him straight anywhere not one bit
Straight
Not a bit of it
Hes been out after eight per cent
since the beginning
Eight per cent
Hell come a cropper one of these days if you ask me
Hes been near it once or twice already
Thats got his nerves to rags
I suppose were all human beings really but what price the sacred Institution of the Family
Us as a bundle
Eh



I dont half disagree with you Vee really only thing is I dont see how youre going to pull it off
A home MAY be a sort of cage but stillits a home
Gives you a right to hang on to the old man until he bustspractically
Jolly hard life for a girl getting a living
Not MY affair
He asked questions and listened to her views for a time
Id chuck this lark right off if I were you Vee he said
Im five years older than you and no end wiser being a man
What youre after is too risky
Its a damned hard thing to do
Its all very handsome starting out on your own but its too damned hard
Thats my opinion if you ask me
Theres nothing a girl can do that isnt sweated to the bone
You square the GV and go home before you have to
Thats my advice
If you dont eat humblepie now you may live to fare worse later
I cant help you a cent
Lifes hard enough nowadays for an unprotected male
Let alone a girl
You got to take the world as it is and the only possible trade for a girl that isnt sweated is to get hold of a man and make him do it for her
Its no good flying out at that Vee I didnt arrange it
Its Providence
Thats how things are thats the order of the world
Like appendicitis
It isnt pretty but were made so
Rot no doubt but we cant alter it
You go home and live on the GV and get some other man to live on as soon as possible
It isnt sentiment but its horse sense
All this WomanwhoDidderyno damn good
After all old PProvidence I meanHAS arranged it so that men will keep you more or less
He made the universe on those lines
Youve got to take what you can get
That was the quintessence of her brother Roddy
He played variations on this theme for the better part of an hour
You go home he said at parting you go home
Its all very fine and all that Vee this freedom but it isnt going to work
The world isnt ready for girls to start out on their own yet thats the plain fact of the case
Babies and females have got to keep hold of somebody or go underanyhow for the next few generations
You go home and wait a century Vee and then try again
Then you may have a bit of a chance
Now you havent the ghost of onenot if you play the game fair
Part 6 It was remarkable to Ann Veronica how completely Mr Manning in his entirely different dialect indorsed her brother Roddys view of things
He came along he said just to call with large loud apologies radiantly kind and good
Miss Stanley it was manifest had given him Ann Veronicas address
The kindly faced landlady had failed to catch his name and said he was a tall handsome gentleman with a great black mustache
Ann Veronica with a sigh at the cost of hospitality made a hasty negotiation for an extra tea and for a fire in the groundfloor apartment and preened herself carefully for the interview
In the little apartment under the gas chandelier his inches and his stoop were certainly very effective
In the bad light he looked at once military and sentimental and studious like one of Ouidas guardsmen revised by Mr Haldane and the London School of Economics and finished in the Keltic school
Its unforgivable of me to call Miss Stanley he said shaking hands in a peculiar high fashionable manner but you know you said we might be friends
Its dreadful for you to be here he said indicating the yellow presence of the first fog of the year without but your aunt told me something of what had happened
Its just like your Splendid Pride to do it
Quite
He sat in the armchair and took tea and consumed several of the extra cakes which she had sent out for and talked to her and expressed himself looking very earnestly at her with his deepset eyes and carefully avoiding any crumbs on his mustache the while
Ann Veronica sat firelit by her teatray with quite unconsciously the air of an expert hostess
But how is it all going to end
said Mr Manning
Your father of course he said must come to realize just how Splendid you are
He doesnt understand
Ive seen him and he doesnt a bit understand
I didnt understand before that letter
It makes me want to be just everything I CAN be to you
Youre like some splendid Princess in Exile in these Dreadful Dingy apartments
Im afraid Im anything but a Princess when it comes to earning a salary said Ann Veronica
But frankly I mean to fight this through if I possibly can
My God
said Manning in a stageaside
Earning a salary
Youre like a Princess in Exile
he repeated overruling her
You come into these sordid surroundingsyou mustnt mind my calling them sordidand it makes them seem as though they didnt matter



I dont think they do matter
I dont think any surroundings could throw a shadow on you
Ann Veronica felt a slight embarrassment
Wont you have some more tea Mr
Manning
she asked
You know said Mr Manning relinquishing his cup without answering her question when I hear you talk of earning a living its as if I heard of an archangel going on the Stock Exchangeor Christ selling doves



Forgive my daring
I couldnt help the thought
Its a very good image said Ann Veronica
I knew you wouldnt mind
But does it correspond with the facts of the case
You know Mr Manning all this sort of thing is very well as sentiment but does it correspond with the realities
Are women truly such angelic things and men so chivalrous
You men have I know meant to make us Queens and Goddesses but in practicewell look for example at the stream of girls one meets going to work of a morning roundshouldered cheap and underfed
They arent queens and no one is treating them as queens
And look again at the women one finds letting lodgings



I was looking for rooms last week
It got on my nervesthe women I saw
Worse than any man
Everywhere I went and rapped at a door I found behind it another dreadful dingy womananother fallen queen I supposedingier than the last dirty you know in grain
Their poor hands
I know said Mr Manning with entirely suitable emotion
And think of the ordinary wives and mothers with their anxiety their limitations their swarms of children
Mr Manning displayed distress
He fended these things off from him with the rump of his fourth piece of cake
I know that our social order is dreadful enough he said and sacrifices all that is best and most beautiful in life
I dont defend it
And besides when it comes to the idea of queens Ann Veronica went on theres twentyone and a half million women to twenty million men
Suppose our proper place is a shrine
Still that leaves over a million shrines short not reckoning widows who remarry
And more boys die than girls so that the real disproportion among adults is even greater
I know said Mr Manning I know these Dreadful Statistics
I know theres a sort of right in your impatience at the slowness of Progress
But tell me one thing I dont understandtell me one thing How can you help it by coming down into the battle and the mire
Thats the thing that concerns me
Oh Im not trying to help it said Ann Veronica
Im only arguing against your position of what a woman should be and trying to get it clear in my own mind
Im in this apartment and looking for work because Well what else can I do when my father practically locks me up
I know said Mr Manning I know
Dont think I cant sympathize and understand
Still here we are in this dingy foggy city
Ye gods
what a wilderness it is
Every one trying to get the better of every one every one regardless of every oneits one of those days when every one bumps against youevery one pouring coal smoke into the air and making confusion worse confounded motor omnibuses clattering and smelling a horse down in the Tottenham Court Road an old woman at the corner coughing dreadfullyall the painful sights of a great city and here you come into it to take your chances
Its too valiant Miss Stanley too valiant altogether
Ann Veronica meditated
She had had two days of employmentseeking now
I wonder if it is
It isnt said Mr Manning that I mind Courage in a WomanI love and admire Courage
What could be more splendid than a beautiful girl facing a great glorious tiger
Una and the Lion again and all that
But this isnt that sort of thing this is just a great ugly endless wilderness of selfish sweating vulgar competition
That you want to keep me out of
Exactly
said Mr Manning
In a sort of beautiful gardenclosewearing lovely dresses and picking beautiful flowers
Ah
If one could
While those other girls trudge to business and those other women let lodgings
And in reality even that magic gardenclose resolves itself into a villa at Morningside Park and my father being more and more cross and overbearing at mealsand a general feeling of insecurity and futility
Mr Manning relinquished his cup and looked meaningly at Ann Veronica
There he said you dont treat me fairly Miss Stanley
My gardenclose would be a better thing than that
CHAPTER THE SEVENTH IDEALS AND A REALITY Part 1 And now for some weeks Ann Veronica was to test her market value in the world
She went about in a negligent November London that had become very dark and foggy and greasy and forbidding indeed and tried to find that modest but independent employment she had so rashly assumed
She went about intentlooking and selfpossessed trim and fine concealing her emotions whatever they were as the realities of her position opened out before her
Her little bedsittingroom was like a lair and she went out from it into this vast dun world with its smokegray houses its glaring streets of shops its dark streets of homes its orangelit windows under skies of dull copper or muddy gray or black much as an animal goes out to seek food
She would come back and write letters carefully planned and written letters or read some book she had fetched from Mudiesshe had invested a halfguinea with Mudiesor sit over her fire and think
Slowly and reluctantly she came to realize that Vivie Warren was what is called an ideal
There were no such girls and no such positions
No work that offered was at all of the quality she had vaguely postulated for herself
With such qualifications as she possessed two chief channels of employment lay open and neither attracted her neither seemed really to offer a conclusive escape from that subjection to mankind against which in the person of her father she was rebelling
One main avenue was for her to become a sort of salaried accessory wife or mother to be a governess or an assistant schoolmistress or a very high type of governessnurse
The other was to go into business into a photographers receptionroom for example or a costumers or hatshop
The first set of occupations seemed to her to be altogether too domestic and restricted for the latter she was dreadfully handicapped by her want of experience
And also she didnt like them
She didnt like the shops she didnt like the other womens faces she thought the smirking men in frockcoats who dominated these establishments the most intolerable persons she had ever had to face
One called her very distinctly My dear
Two secretarial posts did indeed seem to offer themselves in which at least there was no specific exclusion of womanhood one was under a Radical Member of Parliament and the other under a Harley Street doctor and both men declined her proffered services with the utmost civility and admiration and terror
There was also a curious interview at a big hotel with a middleaged whitepowdered woman all covered with jewels and reeking of scent who wanted a Companion
She did not think Ann Veronica would do as her companion
And nearly all these things were fearfully illpaid
They carried no more than bare subsistence wages and they demanded all her time and energy
She had heard of women journalists women writers and so forth but she was not even admitted to the presence of the editors she demanded to see and by no means sure that if she had been she could have done any work they might have given her
One day she desisted from her search and went unexpectedly to the Tredgold College
Her place was not filled she had been simply noted as absent and she did a comforting day of admirable dissection upon the tortoise
She was so interested and this was such a relief from the trudging anxiety of her search for work that she went on for a whole week as if she was still living at home
Then a third secretarial opening occurred and renewed her hopes again a position as amanuensiswith which some of the lighter duties of a nurse were combinedto an infirm gentleman of means living at Twickenham and engaged upon a great literary research to prove that the Faery Queen was really a treatise upon molecular chemistry written in a peculiar and picturesquely handled cipher
Part 2 Now while Ann Veronica was taking these soundings in the industrial sea and measuring herself against the world as it is she was also making extensive explorations among the ideas and attitudes of a number of human beings who seemed to be largely concerned with the world as it ought to be
She was drawn first by Miss Miniver and then by her own natural interest into a curious stratum of people who are busied with dreams of world progress of great and fundamental changes of a New Age that is to replace all the stresses and disorders of contemporary life
Miss Miniver learned of her flight and got her address from the Widgetts
She arrived about nine oclock the next evening in a state of tremulous enthusiasm
She followed the landlady half way upstairs and called up to Ann Veronica May I come up
Its me
You knowNettie Miniver
She appeared before Ann Veronica could clearly recall who Nettie Miniver might be
There was a wild light in her eye and her straight hair was out demonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of its own
Her fingers were bursting through her gloves as if to get at once into touch with Ann Veronica
Youre Glorious
said Miss Miniver in tones of rapture holding a hand in each of hers and peering up into Ann Veronicas face
Glorious
Youre so calm dear and so resolute so serene
Its girls like you who will show them what We are said Miss Miniver girls whose spirits have not been broken
Ann Veronica sunned herself a little in this warmth
I was watching you at Morningside Park dear said Miss Miniver
I am getting to watch all women
I thought then perhaps you didnt care that you were like so many of them
NOW its just as though you had grown up suddenly
She stopped and then suggested I wonderI should loveif it was anything I said
She did not wait for Ann Veronicas reply
She seemed to assume that it must certainly be something she had said
They all catch on she said
It spreads like wildfire
This is such a grand time
Such a glorious time
There never was such a time as this
Everything seems so close to fruition so coming on and leading on
The Insurrection of Women
They spring up everywhere
Tell me all that happened one sisterwoman to another
She chilled Ann Veronica a little by that last phrase and yet the magnetism of her fellowship and enthusiasm was very strong and it was pleasant to be made out a heroine after so much expostulation and so many secret doubts
But she did not listen long she wanted to talk
She sat crouched together by the corner of the hearthrug under the bookcase that supported the pigs skull and looked into the fire and up at Ann Veronicas face and let herself go
Let us put the lamp out she said the flames are ever so much better for talking and Ann Veronica agreed
You are coming right out into lifefacing it all
Ann Veronica sat with her chin on her hand redlit and saying little and Miss Miniver discoursed
As she talked the drift and significance of what she was saying shaped itself slowly to Ann Veronicas apprehension
It presented itself in the likeness of a great gray dull worlda brutal superstitious confused and wrongheaded world that hurt people and limited people unaccountably
In remote times and countries its evil tendencies had expressed themselves in the form of tyrannies massacres wars and what not but just at present in England they shaped as commercialism and competition silk hats suburban morals the sweating system and the subjection of women
So far the thing was acceptable enough
But over against the world Miss Miniver assembled a small but energetic minority the Children of Lightpeople she described as being in the van or altogether in the van about whom Ann Veronicas mind was disposed to be more sceptical
Everything Miss Miniver said was working up everything was coming onthe Higher Thought the Simple Life Socialism Humanitarianism it was all the same really
She loved to be there taking part in it all breathing it being it
Hitherto in the worlds history there had been precursors of this Progress at great intervals voices that had spoken and ceased but now it was all coming on together in a rush
She mentioned with familiar respect Christ and Buddha and Shelley and Nietzsche and Plato
Pioneers all of them
Such names shone brightly in the darkness with black spaces of unilluminated emptiness about them as stars shine in the night but nownow it was different now it was dawnthe real dawn
The women are taking it up said Miss Miniver the women and the common people all pressing forward all roused
Ann Veronica listened with her eyes on the fire
Everybody is taking it up said Miss Miniver
YOU had to come in
You couldnt help it
Something drew you
Something draws everybody
From suburbs from country townseverywhere
I see all the Movements
As far as I can I belong to them all
I keep my finger on the pulse of things
Ann Veronica said nothing
The dawn
said Miss Miniver with her glasses reflecting the fire like pools of bloodred flame
I came to London said Ann Veronica rather because of my own difficulty
I dont know that I understand altogether
Of course you dont said Miss Miniver gesticulating triumphantly with her thin hand and thinner wrist and patting Ann Veronicas knee
Of course you dont
Thats the wonder of it
But you will you will
You must let me take you to thingsto meetings and things to conferences and talks
Then you will begin to see
You will begin to see it all opening out
I am up to the ears in it allevery moment I can spare
I throw up workeverything
I just teach in one school one good school three days a week
All the restMovements
I can live now on fourpence a day
Think how free that leaves me to follow things up
I must take you everywhere
I must take you to the Suffrage people and the Tolstoyans and the Fabians
I have heard of the Fabians said Ann Veronica
Its THE Society
said Miss Miniver
Its the centre of the intellectuals
Some of the meetings are wonderful
Such earnest beautiful women
Such deepbrowed men



And to think that there they are making history
There they are putting together the plans of a new world
Almos lightheartedly
There is Shaw and Webb and Wilkins the author and Toomer and Doctor Tumpanythe most wonderful people
There you see them discussing deciding planning
Just thinkTHEY ARE MAKING A NEW WORLD
But ARE these people going to alter everything
said Ann Veronica
What else can happen
asked Miss Miniver with a little weak gesture at the glow
What else can possibly happenas things are going now
Part 3 Miss Miniver let Ann Veronica into her peculiar levels of the world with so enthusiastic a generosity that it seemed ingratitude to remain critical
Indeed almost insensibly Ann Veronica became habituated to the peculiar appearance and the peculiar manners of the people in the van
The shock of their intellectual attitude was over usage robbed it of the first quaint effect of deliberate unreason
They were in many respects so right she clung to that and shirked more and more the paradoxical conviction that they were also somehow and even in direct relation to that rightness absurd
Very central in Miss Minivers universe were the Goopes
The Goopes were the oddest little couple conceivable following a fruitarian career upon an upper floor in Theobalds Road
They were childless and servantless and they had reduced simple living to the finest of fine arts
Mr Goopes Ann Veronica gathered was a mathematical tutor and visited schools and his wife wrote a weekly column in New Ideas upon vegetarian cookery vivisection degeneration the lacteal secretion appendicitis and the Higher Thought generally and assisted in the management of a fruit shop in the Tottenham Court Road
Their very furniture had mysteriously a highbrowed quality and Mr Goopes when at home dressed simply in a pajamashaped suit of canvas sacking tied with brown ribbons while his wife wore a purple djibbah with a richly embroidered yoke
He was a small dark reserved man with a large inflexiblelooking convex forehead and his wife was very pink and highspirited with one of those chins that pass insensibly into a full strong neck
Once a week every Saturday they had a little gathering from nine till the small hours just talk and perhaps reading aloud and fruitarian refreshmentschestnut sandwiches buttered with nut tose and so forthand lemonade and unfermented wine and to one of these symposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary solicitude conducted Ann Veronica
She was introduced perhaps a little too obviously for her taste as a girl who was standing out against her people to a gathering that consisted of a very old lady with an extremely wrinkled skin and a deep voice who was wearing what appeared to Ann Veronicas inexperienced eye to be an antimacassar upon her head a shy blond young man with a narrow forehead and glasses two undistinguished women in plain skirts and blouses and a middleaged couple very fat and alike in black Mr and Mrs Alderman Dunstable of the Borough Council of Marylebone
These were seated in an imperfect semicircle about a very copperadorned fireplace surmounted by a carved wood inscription DO IT NOW
And to them were presently added a roguishlooking young man with reddish hair an orange tie and a fluffy tweed suit and others who in Ann Veronicas memory in spite of her efforts to recall details remained obstinately just others
The talk was animated and remained always brilliant in form even when it ceased to be brilliant in substance
There were moments when Ann Veronica rather more than suspected the chief speakers to be as schoolboys say showing off at her
They talked of a new substitute for dripping in vegetarian cookery that Mrs Goopes was convinced exercised an exceptionally purifying influence on the mind
And then they talked of Anarchism and Socialism and whether the former was the exact opposite of the latter or only a higher form
The reddishhaired young man contributed allusions to the Hegelian philosophy that momentarily confused the discussion
Then Alderman Dunstable who had hitherto been silent broke out into speech and went off at a tangent and gave his personal impressions of quite a number of his fellowcouncillors
He continued to do this for the rest of the evening intermittently in and out among other topics
He addressed himself chiefly to Goopes and spoke as if in reply to longsustained inquiries on the part of Goopes into the personnel of the Marylebone Borough Council
If you were to ask me he would say I should say Blinders is straight
An ordinary type of course Mrs Dunstables contributions to the conversation were entirely in the form of nods whenever Alderman Dunstable praised or blamed she nodded twice or thrice according to the requirements of his emphasis
And she seemed always to keep one eye on Ann Veronicas dress
Mrs Goopes disconcerted the Alderman a little by abruptly challenging the roguishlooking young man in the orange tie who it seemed was the assistant editor of New Ideas upon a critique of Nietzsche and Tolstoy that had appeared in his paper in which doubts had been cast upon the perfect sincerity of the latter
Everybody seemed greatly concerned about the sincerity of Tolstoy
Miss Miniver said that if once she lost her faith in Tolstoys sincerity nothing she felt would really matter much any more and she appealed to Ann Veronica whether she did not feel the same and Mr Goopes said that we must distinguish between sincerity and irony which was often indeed no more than sincerity at the sublimated level
Alderman Dunstable said that sincerity was often a matter of opportunity and illustrated the point to the fair young man with an anecdote about Blinders on the Dust Destructor Committee during which the young man in the orange tie succeeded in giving the whole discussion a daring and erotic flavor by questioning whether any one could be perfectly sincere in love
Miss Miniver thought that there was no true sincerity except in love and appealed to Ann Veronica but the young man in the orange tie went on to declare that it was quite possible to be sincerely in love with two people at the same time although perhaps on different planes with each individual and deceiving them both
But that brought Mrs Goopes down on him with the lesson Titian teaches so beautifully in his Sacred and Profane Love and became quite eloquent upon the impossibility of any deception in the former
Then they discoursed on love for a time and Alderman Dunstable turning back to the shy blond young man and speaking in undertones of the utmost clearness gave a brief and confidential account of an unfounded rumor of the bifurcation of the affections of Blinders that had led to a situation of some unpleasantness upon the Borough Council
The very old lady in the antimacassar touched Ann Veronicas arm suddenly and said in a deep arch voice Talking of love again spring again love again
Oh
you young people
The young man with the orange tie in spite of Sisyphuslike efforts on the part of Goopes to get the topic on to a higher plane displayed great persistence in speculating upon the possible distribution of the affections of highly developed modern types
The old lady in the antimacassar said abruptly Ah
you young people you young people if you only knew
and then laughed and then mused in a marked manner and the young man with the narrow forehead and glasses cleared his throat and asked the young man in the orange tie whether he believed that Platonic love was possible
Mrs Goopes said she believed in nothing else and with that she glanced at Ann Veronica rose a little abruptly and directed Goopes and the shy young man in the handing of refreshments
But the young man with the orange tie remained in his place disputing whether the body had not something or other which he called its legitimate claims
And from that they came back by way of the Kreutzer Sonata and Resurrection to Tolstoy again
So the talk went on
Goopes who had at first been a little reserved resorted presently to the Socratic method to restrain the young man with the orange tie and bent his forehead over him and brought out at last very clearly from him that the body was only illusion and everything nothing but just spirit and molecules of thought
It became a sort of duel at last between them and all the others sat and listenedevery one that is except the Alderman who had got the blond young man into a corner by the greenstained dresser with the aluminum things and was sitting with his back to every one else holding one hand over his mouth for greater privacy and telling him with an accent of confidential admission in whispers of the chronic struggle between the natural modesty and general inoffensiveness of the Borough Council and the social evil in Marylebone
So the talk went on and presently they were criticising novelists and certain daring essays of Wilkins got their due share of attention and then they were discussing the future of the theatre
Ann Veronica intervened a little in the novelist discussion with a defence of Esmond and a denial that the Egoist was obscure and when she spoke every one else stopped talking and listened
Then they deliberated whether Bernard Shaw ought to go into Parliament
And that brought them to vegetarianism and teetotalism and the young man in the orange tie and Mrs Goopes had a great setto about the sincerity of Chesterton and Belloc that was ended by Goopes showing signs of resuming the Socratic method
And at last Ann Veronica and Miss Miniver came down the dark staircase and out into the foggy spaces of the London squares and crossed Russell Square Woburn Square Gordon Square making an oblique route to Ann Veronicas lodging
They trudged along a little hungry because of the fruitarian refreshments and mentally very active
And Miss Miniver fell discussing whether Goopes or Bernard Shaw or Tolstoy or Doctor Tumpany or Wilkins the author had the more powerful and perfect mind in existence at the present time
She was clear there were no other minds like them in all the world
Part 4 Then one evening Ann Veronica went with Miss Miniver into the back seats of the gallery at Essex Hall and heard and saw the giant leaders of the Fabian Society who are remaking the world Bernard Shaw and Toomer and Doctor Tumpany and Wilkins the author all displayed upon a platform
The place was crowded and the people about her were almost equally made up of very goodlooking and enthusiastic young people and a great variety of Goopeslike types
In the discussion there was the oddest mixture of things that were personal and petty with an idealist devotion that was fine beyond dispute
In nearly every speech she heard was the same implication of great and necessary changes in the worldchanges to be won by effort and sacrifice indeed but surely to be won
And afterward she saw a very much larger and more enthusiastic gathering a meeting of the advanced section of the woman movement in Caxton Hall where the same note of vast changes in progress sounded and she went to a soiree of the Dress Reform Association and visited a Food Reform Exhibition where imminent change was made even alarmingly visible
The womens meeting was much more charged with emotional force than the Socialists
Ann Veronica was carried off her intellectual and critical feet by it altogether and applauded and uttered cries that subsequent reflection failed to endorse
I knew you would feel it said Miss Miniver as they came away flushed and heated
I knew you would begin to see how it all falls into place together
It did begin to fall into place together
She became more and more alive not so much to a system of ideas as to a big diffused impulse toward change to a great discontent with and criticism of life as it is lived to a clamorous confusion of ideas for reconstructionreconstruction of the methods of business of economic development of the rules of property of the status of children of the clothing and feeding and teaching of every one she developed a quite exaggerated consciousness of a multitude of people going about the swarming spaces of London with their minds full their talk and gestures full their very clothing charged with the suggestion of the urgency of this pervasive project of alteration
Some indeed carried themselves dressed themselves even rather as foreign visitors from the land of Looking Backward and News from Nowhere than as the indigenous Londoners they were
For the most part these were detached people men practising the plastic arts young writers young men in employment a very large proportion of girls and womenself supporting women or girls of the student class
They made a stratum into which Ann Veronica was now plunged up to her neck it had become her stratum
None of the things they said and did were altogether new to Ann Veronica but now she got them massed and alive instead of by glimpses or in booksalive and articulate and insistent
The London backgrounds in Bloomsbury and Marylebone against which these people went to and fro took on by reason of their gray facades their implacably respectable windows and windowblinds their reiterated unmeaning iron railings a stronger and stronger suggestion of the flavor of her father at his most obdurate phase and of all that she felt herself fighting against
She was already a little prepared by her discursive reading and discussion under the Widgett influence for ideas and movements though temperamentally perhaps she was rather disposed to resist and criticise than embrace them
But the people among whom she was now thrown through the social exertions of Miss Miniver and the Widgettsfor Teddy and Hetty came up from Morningside Park and took her to an eighteenpenny dinner in Soho and introduced her to some art students who were also Socialists and so opened the way to an evening of meandering talk in a studiocarried with them like an atmosphere this implication not only that the world was in some stupid and even obvious way WRONG with which indeed she was quite prepared to agree but that it needed only a few pioneers to behave as such and be thoroughly and indiscriminately advanced for the new order to achieve itself
When ninety per cent
out of the ten or twelve people one meets in a month not only say but feel and assume a thing it is very hard not to fall into the belief that the thing is so
Imperceptibly almost Ann Veronica began to acquire the new attitude even while her mind still resisted the felted ideas that went with it
And Miss Miniver began to sway her
The very facts that Miss Miniver never stated an argument clearly that she was never embarrassed by a sense of selfcontradiction and had little more respect for consistency of statement than a washerwoman has for wisps of vapor which made Ann Veronica critical and hostile at their first encounter in Morningside Park became at last with constant association the secret of Miss Minivers growing influence
The brain tires of resistance and when it meets again and again incoherently active the same phrases the same ideas that it has already slain exposed and dissected and buried it becomes less and less energetic to repeat the operation
There must be something one feels in ideas that achieve persistently a successful resurrection
What Miss Miniver would have called the Higher Truth supervenes
Yet through these talks these meetings and conferences these movements and efforts Ann Veronica for all that she went with her friend and at times applauded with her enthusiastically yet went nevertheless with eyes that grew more and more puzzled and fine eyebrows more and more disposed to knit
She was with these movementsakin to them she felt it at times intenselyand yet something eluded her
Morningside Park had been passive and defective all this rushed about and was active but it was still defective
It still failed in something
It did seem germane to the matter that so many of the people in the van were plain people or faded people or tiredlooking people
It did affect the business that they all argued badly and were egotistical in their manners and inconsistent in their phrases
There were moments when she doubted whether the whole mass of movements and societies and gatherings and talks was not simply one coherent spectacle of failure protecting itself from abjection by the glamour of its own assertions
It happened that at the extremest point of Ann Veronicas social circle from the Widgetts was the family of the Morningside Park horsedealer a company of extremely dressy and hilarious young women with one equestrian brother addicted to fancy waistcoats cigars and facial spots
These girls wore hats at remarkable angles and bows to startle and kill they liked to be right on the spot every time and up to everything that was it from the very beginning and they rendered their conception of Socialists and all reformers by the words positively frightening and weird
Well it was beyond dispute that these words did convey a certain quality of the Movements in general amid which Miss Miniver disported herself
They WERE weird
And yet for all that It got into Ann Veronicas nights at last and kept her awake the perplexing contrast between the advanced thought and the advanced thinker
The general propositions of Socialism for example struck her as admirable but she certainly did not extend her admiration to any of its exponents
She was still more stirred by the idea of the equal citizenship of men and women by the realization that a big and growing organization of women were giving form and a generalized expression to just that personal pride that aspiration for personal freedom and respect which had brought her to London but when she heard Miss Miniver discoursing on the next step in the suffrage campaign or read of women badgering Cabinet Ministers padlocked to railings or getting up in a public meeting to pipe out a demand for votes and be carried out kicking and screaming her soul revolted
She could not part with dignity
Something as yet unformulated within her kept her estranged from all these practical aspects of her beliefs
Not for these things O Ann Veronica have you revolted it said and this is not your appropriate purpose
It was as if she faced a darkness in which was something very beautiful and wonderful as yet unimagined
The little pucker in her brows became more perceptible
Part 5 In the beginning of December Ann Veronica began to speculate privately upon the procedure of pawning
She had decided that she would begin with her pearl necklace
She spent a very disagreeable afternoon and eveningit was raining fast outside and she had very unwisely left her soundest pair of boots in the boothole of her fathers house in Morningside Parkthinking over the economic situation and planning a course of action
Her aunt had secretly sent on to Ann Veronica some new warm underclothing a dozen pairs of stockings and her last winters jacket but the dear lady had overlooked those boots
These things illuminated her situation extremely
Finally she decided upon a step that had always seemed reasonable to her but that hitherto she had from motives too faint for her to formulate refrained from taking
She resolved to go into the City to Ramage and ask for his advice
And next morning she attired herself with especial care and neatness found his address in the Directory at a postoffice and went to him
She had to wait some minutes in an outer office wherein three young men of spirited costume and appearance regarded her with illconcealed curiosity and admiration
Then Ramage appeared with effusion and ushered her into his inner apartment
The three young men exchanged expressive glances
The inner apartment was rather gracefully furnished with a thick fine Turkish carpet a good brass fender a fine old bureau and on the walls were engravings of two young girls heads by Greuze and of some modern picture of boys bathing in a sunlit pool
But this is a surprise
said Ramage
This is wonderful
Ive been feeling that you had vanished from my world
Have you been away from Morningside Park
Im not interrupting you
You are
Splendidly
Business exists for such interruptions
There you are the best clients chair
Ann Veronica sat down and Ramages eager eyes feasted on her
Ive been looking out for you he said
I confess it
She had not she reflected remembered how prominent his eyes were
I want some advice said Ann Veronica
Yes
You remember once how we talkedat a gate on the Downs
We talked about how a girl might get an independent living
Yes yes
Well you see something has happened at home
She paused
Nothing has happened to Mr
Stanley
Ive fallen out with my father
It was abouta question of what I might do or might not do
HeIn fact hehe locked me in my room
Practically
Her breath left her for a moment
I SAY
said Mr Ramage
I wanted to go to an artstudent ball of which he disapproved
And why shouldnt you
I felt that sort of thing couldnt go on
So I packed up and came to London next day
To a friend
To lodgingsalone
I say you know you have some pluck
You did it on your own
Ann Veronica smiled
Quite on my own she said
Its magnificent
He leaned back and regarded her with his head a little on one side
By Jove
he said there is something direct about you
I wonder if I should have locked you up if Id been your father
Luckily Im not
And you started out forthwith to fight the world and be a citizen on your own basis
He came forward again and folded his hands under him on his desk
How has the world taken it
he asked
If I was the world I think I should have put down a crimson carpet and asked you to say what you wanted and generally walk over me
But the world didnt do that
Not exactly
It presented a large impenetrable back and went on thinking about something else
It offered from fifteen to twoandtwenty shillings a weekfor drudgery
The world has no sense of what is due to youth and courage
It never has had
Yes said Ann Veronica
But the thing is I want a job
Exactly
And so you came along to me
And you see I dont turn my back and I am looking at you and thinking about you from top to toe
And what do you think I ought to do
Exactly
He lifted a paperweight and dabbed it gently down again
What ought you to do
Ive hunted up all sorts of things
The point to note is that fundamentally you dont want particularly to do it
I dont understand
You want to be free and so forth yes
But you dont particularly want to do the job that sets you freefor its own sake
I mean that it doesnt interest you in itself
I suppose not
Thats one of our differences
We men are like children
We can get absorbed in play in games in the business we do
Thats really why we do them sometimes rather well and get on
But womenwomen as a rule dont throw themselves into things like that
As a matter of fact it isnt their affair
And as a natural consequence they dont do so well and they dont get onand so the world doesnt pay them
They dont catch on to discursive interests you see because they are more serious they are concentrated on the central reality of life and a little impatient of itsits outer aspects
At least that I think is what makes a clever womans independent career so much more difficult than a clever mans
She doesnt develop a specialty
Ann Veronica was doing her best to follow him
She has one thats why
Her specialty is the central thing in life it is life itself the warmth of life sexand love
He pronounced this with an air of profound conviction and with his eyes on Ann Veronicas face
He had an air of having told her a deep personal secret
She winced as he thrust the fact at her was about to answer and checked herself
She colored faintly
That doesnt touch the question I asked you she said
It may be true but it isnt quite what I have in mind
Of course not said Ramage as one who rouses himself from deep preoccupations And he began to question her in a businesslike way upon the steps she had taken and the inquiries she had made
He displayed none of the airy optimism of their previous talk over the downland gate
He was helpful but gravely dubious
You see he said from my point of view youre grown upyoure as old as all the goddesses and the contemporary of any man alive
But from thethe economic point of view youre a very young and altogether inexperienced person
He returned to and developed that idea
Youre still he said in the educational years
From the point of view of most things in the world of employment which a woman can do reasonably well and earn a living by youre unripe and halfeducated
If you had taken your degree for example
He spoke of secretarial work but even there she would need to be able to do typing and shorthand
He made it more and more evident to her that her proper course was not to earn a salary but to accumulate equipment
You see he said you are like an inaccessible goldmine in all this sort of matter
Youre splendid stuff you know but youve got nothing ready to sell
Thats the flat business situation
He thought
Then he slapped his hand on his desk and looked up with the air of a man struck by a brilliant idea
Look here he said protruding his eyes why get anything to do at all just yet
Why if you must be free why not do the sensible thing
Make yourself worth a decent freedom
Go on with your studies at the Imperial College for example get a degree and make yourself good value
Or become a thoroughgoing typist and stenographer and secretarial expert
But I cant do that
Why not
You see if I do go home my father objects to the College and as for typing Dont go home
Yes but you forget how am I to live
Easily
Easily



Borrow



From me
I couldnt do that said Ann Veronica sharply
I see no reason why you shouldnt
Its impossible
As one friend to another
Men are always doing it and if you set up to be a man No its absolutely out of the question Mr
Ramage
And Ann Veronicas face was hot
Ramage pursed his rather loose lips and shrugged his shoulders with his eyes fixed steadily upon her
Well anyhow I dont see the force of your objection you know
Thats my advice to you
Here I am
Consider youve got resources deposited with me
Perhaps at the first blushit strikes you as odd
People are brought up to be so shy about money
As though it was indelicateits just a sort of shyness
But here I am to draw upon
Here I am as an alternative either to nasty workor going home
Its very kind of you began Ann Veronica
Not a bit
Just a friendly polite suggestion
I dont suggest any philanthropy
I shall charge you five per cent you know fair and square
Ann Veronica opened her lips quickly and did not speak
But the five per cent
certainly did seem to improve the aspect of Ramages suggestion
Well anyhow consider it open
He dabbed with his paperweight again and spoke in an entirely indifferent tone
And now tell me please how you eloped from Morningside Park
How did you get your luggage out of the house
Wasnt itwasnt it rather in some respectsrather a lark
Its one of my regrets for my lost youth
I never ran away from anywhere with anybody anywhen
And nowI suppose I should be considered too old
I dont feel it



Didnt you feel rather EVENTFULin the traincoming up to Waterloo
Part 6 Before Christmas Ann Veronica had gone to Ramage again and accepted this offer she had at first declined
Many little things had contributed to that decision
The chief influence was her awakening sense of the need of money
She had been forced to buy herself that pair of boots and a walkingskirt and the pearl necklace at the pawnbrokers had yielded very disappointingly
And also she wanted to borrow that money
It did seem in so many ways exactly what Ramage said it wasthe sensible thing to do
There it wasto be borrowed
It would put the whole adventure on a broader and better footing it seemed indeed almost the only possible way in which she might emerge from her rebellion with anything like success
If only for the sake of her argument with her home she wanted success
And why after all should she not borrow money from Ramage
It was so true what he said middleclass people WERE ridiculously squeamish about money
Why should they be
She and Ramage were friends very good friends
If she was in a position to help him she would help him only it happened to be the other way round
He was in a position to help her
What was the objection
She found it impossible to look her own diffidence in the face
So she went to Ramage and came to the point almost at once
Can you spare me forty pounds
she said
Mr Ramage controlled his expression and thought very quickly
Agreed he said certainly and drew a checkbook toward him
Its best he said to make it a good round sum
I wont give you a check though Yes I will
Ill give you an uncrossed check and then you can get it at the bank here quite close by



Youd better not have all the money on you you had better open a small account in the postoffice and draw it out a fiver at a time
That wont involve references as a bank account wouldand all that sort of thing
The money will last longer andit wont bother you
He stood up rather close to her and looked into her eyes
He seemed to be trying to understand something very perplexing and elusive
Its jolly he said to feel you have come to me
Its a sort of guarantee of confidence
Last timeyou made me feel snubbed
He hesitated and went off at a tangent
Theres no end of things Id like to talk over with you
Its just upon my lunchtime
Come and have lunch with me
Ann Veronica fenced for a moment
I dont want to take up your time
We wont go to any of these City places
Theyre just all men and no one is safe from scandal
But I know a little place where well get a little quiet talk
Ann Veronica for some indefinable reason did not want to lunch with him a reason indeed so indefinable that she dismissed it and Ramage went through the outer office with her alert and attentive to the vivid interest of the three clerks
The three clerks fought for the only window and saw her whisked into a hansom
Their subsequent conversation is outside the scope of our story
Ritters
said Ramage to the driver Dean Street
It was rare that Ann Veronica used hansoms and to be in one was itself eventful and exhilarating
She liked the high easy swing of the thing over its big wheels the quick clatterpatter of the horse the passage of the teeming streets
She admitted her pleasure to Ramage
And Ritters too was very amusing and foreign and discreet a little rambling room with a number of small tables with red electric light shades and flowers
It was an overcast day albeit not foggy and the electric light shades glowed warmly and an Italian waiter with insufficient English took Ramages orders and waited with an appearance of affection
Ann Veronica thought the whole affair rather jolly
Ritter sold better food than most of his compatriots and cooked it better and Ramage with a fine perception of a feminine palate ordered Vero Capri
It was Ann Veronica felt as a sip or so of that remarkable blend warmed her blood just the sort of thing that her aunt would not approve to be lunching thus teteatete with a man and yet at the same time it was a perfectly innocent as well as agreeable proceeding
They talked across their meal in an easy and friendly manner about Ann Veronicas affairs
He was really very bright and clever with a sort of conversational boldness that was just within the limits of permissible daring
She described the Goopes and the Fabians to him and gave him a sketch of her landlady and he talked in the most liberal and entertaining way of a modern young womans outlook
He seemed to know a great deal about life
He gave glimpses of possibilities
He roused curiosities
He contrasted wonderfully with the empty showingoff of Teddy
His friendship seemed a thing worth having



But when she was thinking it over in her room that evening vague and baffling doubts came drifting across this conviction
She doubted how she stood toward him and what the restrained gleam of his face might signify
She felt that perhaps in her desire to play an adequate part in the conversation she had talked rather more freely than she ought to have done and given him a wrong impression of herself
Part 7 That was two days before Christmas Eve
The next morning came a compact letter from her father
MY DEAR DAUGHTER it ranHere on the verge of the season of forgiveness I hold out a last hand to you in the hope of a reconciliation
I ask you although it is not my place to ask you to return home
This roof is still open to you
You will not be taunted if you return and everything that can be done will be done to make you happy
Indeed I must implore you to return
This adventure of yours has gone on altogether too long it has become a serious distress to both your aunt and myself
We fail altogether to understand your motives in doing what you are doing or indeed how you are managing to do it or what you are managing on
If you will think only of one trifling aspectthe inconvenience it must be to us to explain your absenceI think you may begin to realize what it all means for us
I need hardly say that your aunt joins with me very heartily in this request
Please come home
You will not find me unreasonable with you
Your affectionate FATHER
Ann Veronica sat over her fire with her fathers note in her hand
Queer letters he writes she said
I suppose most peoples letters are queer
Roof openlike a Noahs Ark
I wonder if he really wants me to go home
Its odd how little I know of him and of how he feels and what he feels
I wonder how he treated Gwen
Her mind drifted into a speculation about her sister
I ought to look up Gwen she said
I wonder what happened
Then she fell to thinking about her aunt
I would like to go home she cried to please her
She has been a dear
Considering how little he lets her have
The truth prevailed
The unaccountable thing is that I wouldnt go home to please her
She is in her way a dear
One OUGHT to want to please her
And I dont
I dont care
I cant even make myself care
Presently as if for comparison with her fathers letter she got out Ramages check from the box that contained her papers
For so far she had kept it uncashed
She had not even endorsed it
Suppose I chuck it she remarked standing with the mauve slip in her handsuppose I chuck it and surrender and go home
Perhaps after all Roddy was right
Father keeps opening the door and shutting it but a time will come I could still go home
She held Ramages check as if to tear it across
No she said at last Im a human beingnot a timid female
What could I do at home
The others a crumpleupjust surrender
Funk
Ill see it out
CHAPTER THE EIGHTH BIOLOGY Part 1 January found Ann Veronica a student in the biological laboratory of the Central Imperial College that towers up from among the back streets in the angle between Euston Road and Great Portland Street
She was working very steadily at the Advanced Course in Comparative Anatomy wonderfully relieved to have her mind engaged upon one methodically developing theme in the place of the discursive uncertainties of the previous two months and doing her utmost to keep right in the back of her mind and out of sight the facts firstly that she had achieved this haven of satisfactory activity by incurring a debt to Ramage of forty pounds and secondly that her present position was necessarily temporary and her outlook quite uncertain
The biological laboratory had an atmosphere that was all its own
It was at the top of the building and looked clear over a clustering mass of inferior buildings toward Regents Park
It was long and narrow a welllit wellventilated quiet gallery of small tables and sinks pervaded by a thin smell of methylated spirit and of a mitigated and sterilized organic decay
Along the inner side was a wonderfully arranged series of displayed specimens that Russell himself had prepared
The supreme effect for Ann Veronica was its surpassing relevance it made every other atmosphere she knew seem discursive and confused
The whole place and everything in it aimed at one thingto illustrate to elaborate to criticise and illuminate and make ever plainer and plainer the significance of animal and vegetable structure
It dealt from floor to ceiling and end to end with the Theory of the Forms of Life the very duster by the blackboard was there to do its share in that work the very washers in the taps the room was more simply concentrated in aim even than a church
To that perhaps a large part of its satisfyingness was due
Contrasted with the confused movement and presences of a Fabian meeting or the inexplicable enthusiasm behind the suffrage demand with the speeches that were partly egotistical displays partly artful manoeuvres and partly incoherent cries for unsoundly formulated ends compared with the comings and goings of audiences and supporters that were like the eddydriven drift of paper in the street this long quiet methodical chamber shone like a star seen through clouds
Day after day for a measured hour in the lecturetheatre with elaborate power and patience Russell pieced together difficulty and suggestion instance and counterinstance in the elaborate construction of the family tree of life
And then the students went into the long laboratory and followed out these facts in almost living tissue with microscope and scalpel probe and microtome and the utmost of their skill and care making now and then a raid into the compact museum of illustration next door in which specimens and models and directions stood in disciplined ranks under the direction of the demonstrator Capes
There was a couple of blackboards at each end of the aisle of tables and at these Capes with quick and nervous speech that contrasted vividly with Russells slow definitive articulation directed the dissection and made illuminating comments on the structures under examination
Then he would come along the laboratory sitting down by each student in turn checking the work and discussing its difficulties and answering questions arising out of Russells lecture
Ann Veronica had come to the Imperial College obsessed by the great figure of Russell by the part he had played in the Darwinian controversies and by the resolute effect of the grimlipped yellow leonine face beneath the mane of silvery hair
Capes was rather a discovery
Capes was something superadded
Russell burned like a beacon but Capes illuminated by darting flashes and threw light even if it was but momentary light into a hundred corners that Russell left steadfastly in the shade
Capes was an exceptionally fair man of two or threeandthirty so ruddily blond that it was a mercy he had escaped light eyelashes and with a minor but by no means contemptible reputation of his own
He talked at the blackboard in a pleasant very slightly lisping voice with a curious spontaneity and was sometimes very clumsy in his exposition and sometimes very vivid
He dissected rather awkwardly and hurriedly but on the whole effectively and drew with an impatient directness that made up in significance what it lacked in precision
Across the blackboard the colored chalks flew like flights of variously tinted rockets as diagram after diagram flickered into being
There happened that year to be an unusual proportion of girls and women in the advanced laboratory perhaps because the class as a whole was an exceptionally small one
It numbered nine and four of these were women students
As a consequence of its small size it was possible to get along with the work on a much easier and more colloquial footing than a larger class would have permitted
And a custom had grown up of a general tea at four oclock under the auspices of a Miss Garvice a tall and graceful girl of distinguished intellectual incompetence in whom the hostess instinct seemed to be abnormally developed
Capes would come to these teas he evidently liked to come and he would appear in the doorway of the preparationroom a pleasing note of shyness in his manner hovering for an invitation
From the first Ann Veronica found him an exceptionally interesting man
To begin with he struck her as being the most variable person she had ever encountered
At times he was brilliant and masterful talked round and over every one and would have been domineering if he had not been extraordinarily kindly at times he was almost monosyllabic and defeated Miss Garvices most skilful attempts to draw him out
Sometimes he was obviously irritable and uncomfortable and unfortunate in his efforts to seem at ease
And sometimes he overflowed with a peculiarly malignant wit that played with devastating effect upon any topics that had the courage to face it
Ann Veronicas experiences of men had been among more stable typesTeddy who was always absurd her father who was always authoritative and sentimental Manning who was always Manning
And most of the others she had met had she felt the same steadfastness
Goopes she was sure was always highbrowed and slow and Socratic
And Ramage tooabout Ramage there would always be that air of avidity that air of knowledge and inquiry the mixture of things in his talk that were rather good with things that were rather poor
But one could not count with any confidence upon Capes
The five men students were a mixed company
There was a very whitefaced youngster of eighteen who brushed back his hair exactly in Russells manner and was disposed to be uncomfortably silent when he was near her and to whom she felt it was only Christian kindness to be consistently pleasant and a lax young man of fiveandtwenty in navy blue who mingled Marx and Bebel with the more orthodox gods of the biological pantheon
There was a short redfaced resolute youth who inherited an authoritative attitude upon bacteriology from his father a Japanese student of unassuming manners who drew beautifully and had an imperfect knowledge of English and a dark unwashed Scotchman with complicated spectacles who would come every morning as a sort of volunteer supplementary demonstrator look very closely at her work and her tell her that her dissections were fairish or very fairish indeed or high above the normal female standard hover as if for some outbreak of passionate gratitude and with admiring retrospects that made the facetted spectacles gleam like diamonds return to his own place
The women Ann Veronica thought were not quite so interesting as the men
There were two schoolmistresses one of whomMiss Kleggmight have been a first cousin to Miss Miniver she had so many Miniver traits there was a preoccupied girl whose name Ann Veronica never learned but who worked remarkably well and Miss Garvice who began by attracting her very greatlyshe moved so beautifullyand ended by giving her the impression that moving beautifully was the beginning and end of her being
Part 2 The next few weeks were a time of the very liveliest thought and growth for Ann Veronica
The crowding impressions of the previous weeks seemed to run together directly her mind left the chaotic search for employment and came into touch again with a coherent and systematic development of ideas
The advanced work at the Central Imperial College was in the closest touch with living interests and current controversies it drew its illustrations and material from Russells two great researchesupon the relation of the brachiopods to the echinodermata and upon the secondary and tertiary mammalian and pseudomammalian factors in the free larval forms of various marine organisms
Moreover a vigorous fire of mutual criticism was going on now between the Imperial College and the Cambridge Mendelians and echoed in the lectures
From beginning to end it was firsthand stuff
But the influence of the science radiated far beyond its own special fieldbeyond those beautiful but highly technical problems with which we do not propose for a moment to trouble the naturally terrified reader
Biology is an extraordinarily digestive science
It throws out a number of broad experimental generalizations and then sets out to bring into harmony or relation with these an infinitely multifarious collection of phenomena
The little streaks upon the germinating area of an egg the nervous movements of an impatient horse the trick of a calculating boy the senses of a fish the fungus at the root of a garden flower and the slime upon a seawet rockten thousand such things bear their witness and are illuminated
And not only did these tentacular generalizations gather all the facts of natural history and comparative anatomy together but they seemed always stretching out further and further into a world of interests that lay altogether outside their legitimate bounds
It came to Ann Veronica one night after a long talk with Miss Miniver as a sudden remarkable thing as a grotesque novel aspect that this slowly elaborating biological scheme had something more than an academic interest for herself
And not only so but that it was after all a more systematic and particular method of examining just the same questions that underlay the discussions of the Fabian Society the talk of the West Central Arts Club the chatter of the studios and the deep the bottomless discussions of the simplelife homes
It was the same Bios whose nature and drift and ways and methods and aspects engaged them all
And she she in her own person too was this eternal Bios beginning again its recurrent journey to selection and multiplication and failure or survival
But this was but a momentary gleam of personal application and at this time she followed it up no further
And now Ann Veronicas evenings were also becoming very busy
She pursued her interest in the Socialist movement and in the Suffragist agitation in the company of Miss Miniver
They went to various central and local Fabian gatherings and to a number of suffrage meetings
Teddy Widgett hovered on the fringe of all these gatherings blinking at Ann Veronica and occasionally making a wildly friendly dash at her and carrying her and Miss Miniver off to drink cocoa with a choice diversity of other youthful and congenial Fabians after the meetings
Then Mr Manning loomed up ever and again into her world full of a futile solicitude and almost always declaring she was splendid splendid and wishing he could talk things out with her
Teas he contributed to the commissariat of Ann Veronicas campaignquite a number of teas
He would get her to come to tea with him usually in a pleasant tearoom over a fruitshop in Tottenham Court Road and he would discuss his own point of view and hint at a thousand devotions were she but to command him
And he would express various artistic sensibilities and aesthetic appreciations in carefully punctuated sentences and a large clear voice
At Christmas he gave her a set of a small edition of Merediths novels very prettily bound in flexible leather being guided in the choice of an author as he intimated rather by her preferences than his own
There was something markedly and deliberately liberalminded in his manner in all their encounters
He conveyed not only his sense of the extreme want of correctitude in their unsanctioned meetings but also that so far as he was concerned this irregularity mattered not at all that he had flungand kept on flinging such considerations to the wind
And in addition she was now seeing and talking to Ramage almost weekly on a theory which she took very gravely that they were exceptionally friends
He would ask her to come to dinner with him in some little Italian or semiBohemian restaurant in the district toward Soho or in one of the more stylish and magnificent establishments about Piccadilly Circus and for the most part she did not care to refuse
Nor indeed did she want to refuse
These dinners from their lavish display of ambiguous hors doeuvre to their skimpy ices in dishes of frilled paper with their Chianti flasks and Parmesan dishes and their polyglot waiters and polyglot clientele were very funny and bright and she really liked Ramage and valued his help and advice
It was interesting to see how different and characteristic his mode of approach was to all sorts of questions that interested her and it was amusing to discover this other side to the life of a Morningside Park inhabitant
She had thought that all Morningside Park householders came home before seven at the latest as her father usually did
Ramage talked always about women or some womans concern and very much about Ann Veronicas own outlook upon life
He was always drawing contrasts between a womans lot and a mans and treating her as a wonderful new departure in this comparison
Ann Veronica liked their relationship all the more because it was an unusual one
After these dinners they would have a walk usually to the Thames Embankment to see the two sweeps of river on either side of Waterloo Bridge and then they would part at Westminster Bridge perhaps and he would go on to Waterloo
Once he suggested they should go to a musichall and see a wonderful new dancer but Ann Veronica did not feel she cared to see a new dancer
So instead they talked of dancing and what it might mean in a human life
Ann Veronica thought it was a spontaneous release of energy expressive of wellbeing but Ramage thought that by dancing men and such birds and animals as dance come to feel and think of their bodies
This intercourse which had been planned to warm Ann Veronica to a familiar affection with Ramage was certainly warming Ramage to a constantly deepening interest in Ann Veronica
He felt that he was getting on with her very slowly indeed but he did not see how he could get on faster
He had he felt to create certain ideas and vivify certain curiosities and feelings in her
Until that was done a certain experience of life assured him that a girl is a locked coldness against a mans approach
She had all the fascination of being absolutely perplexing in this respect
On the one hand she seemed to think plainly and simply and would talk serenely and freely about topics that most women have been trained either to avoid or conceal and on the other she was unconscious or else she had an air of being unconsciousthat was the riddleto all sorts of personal applications that almost any girl or woman one might have thought would have made
He was always doing his best to call her attention to the fact that he was a man of spirit and quality and experience and she a young and beautiful woman and that all sorts of constructions upon their relationship were possible trusting her to go on from that to the idea that all sorts of relationships were possible
She responded with an unfaltering appearance of insensibility and never as a young and beautiful woman conscious of sex always in the character of an intelligent girl student
His perception of her personal beauty deepened and quickened with each encounter
Every now and then her general presence became radiantly dazzling in his eyes she would appear in the street coming toward him a surprise so fine and smiling and welcoming was she so expanded and illuminated and living in contrast with his mere expectation
Or he would find somethinga wave in her hair a little line in the contour of her brow or neck that made an exquisite discovery
He was beginning to think about her inordinately
He would sit in his inner office and compose conversations with her penetrating illuminating and nearly conclusiveconversations that never proved to be of the slightest use at all with her when he met her face to face
And he began also at times to wake at night and think about her
He thought of her and himself and no longer in that vein of incidental adventure in which he had begun
He thought too of the fretful invalid who lay in the next room to his whose money had created his business and made his position in the world
Ive had most of the things I wanted said Ramage in the stillness of the night
Part 3 For a time Ann Veronicas family had desisted from direct offers of a free pardon they were evidently waiting for her resources to come to an end
Neither father aunt nor brothers made a sign and then one afternoon in early February her aunt came up in a state between expostulation and dignified resentment but obviously very anxious for Ann Veronicas welfare
I had a dream in the night she said
I saw you in a sort of sloping slippery place holding on by your hands and slipping
You seemed to me to be slipping and slipping and your face was white
It was really most vivid most vivid
You seemed to be slipping and just going to tumble and holding on
It made me wake up and there I lay thinking of you spending your nights up here all alone and no one to look after you
I wondered what you could be doing and what might be happening to you
I said to myself at once Either this is a coincidence or the caper sauce
But I made sure it was you
I felt I MUST do something anyhow and up I came just as soon as I could to see you
She had spoken rather rapidly
I cant help saying it she said with the quality of her voice altering but I do NOT think it is right for an unprotected girl to be in London alone as you are
But Im quite equal to taking care of myself aunt
It must be most uncomfortable here
It is most uncomfortable for every one concerned
She spoke with a certain asperity
She felt that Ann Veronica had duped her in that dream and now that she had come up to London she might as well speak her mind
No Christmas dinner she said or anything nice
One doesnt even know what you are doing
Im going on working for my degree
Why couldnt you do that at home
Im working at the Imperial College
You see aunt its the only possible way for me to get a good degree in my subjects and father wont hear of it
Thered only be endless rows if I was at home
And how could I come homewhen he locks me in rooms and all that
I do wish this wasnt going on said Miss Stanley after a pause
I do wish you and your father could come to some agreement
Ann Veronica responded with conviction I wish so too
Cant we arrange something
Cant we make a sort of treaty
He wouldnt keep it
He would get very cross one evening and no one would dare to remind him of it
How can you say such things
But he would
Still it isnt your place to say so
It prevents a treaty
Couldnt I make a treaty
Ann Veronica thought and could not see any possible treaty that would leave it open for her to have quasisurreptitious dinners with Ramage or go on walking round the London squares discussing Socialism with Miss Miniver toward the small hours
She had tasted freedom now and so far she had not felt the need of protection
Still there certainly was something in the idea of a treaty
I dont see at all how you can be managing said Miss Stanley and Ann Veronica hastened to reply I do on very little
Her mind went back to that treaty
And arent there fees to pay at the Imperial College
her aunt was sayinga disagreeable question
There are a few fees
Then how have you managed
Bother
said Ann Veronica to herself and tried not to look guilty
I was able to borrow the money
Borrow the money
But who lent you the money
A friend said Ann Veronica
She felt herself getting into a corner
She sought hastily in her mind for a plausible answer to an obvious question that didnt come
Her aunt went off at a tangent
But my dear Ann Veronica you will be getting into debt
Ann Veronica at once and with a feeling of immense relief took refuge in her dignity
I think aunt she said you might trust to my selfrespect to keep me out of that
For the moment her aunt could not think of any reply to this counterstroke and Ann Veronica followed up her advantage by a sudden inquiry about her abandoned boots
But in the train going home her aunt reasoned it out
If she is borrowing money said Miss Stanley she MUST be getting into debt
Its all nonsense



Part 4 It was by imperceptible degrees that Capes became important in Ann Veronicas thoughts
But then he began to take steps and at last strides to something more and more like predominance
She began by being interested in his demonstrations and his biological theory then she was attracted by his character and then in a manner she fell in love with his mind
One day they were at tea in the laboratory and a discussion sprang up about the question of womens suffrage
The movement was then in its earlier militant phases and one of the women only Miss Garvice opposed it though Ann Veronica was disposed to be lukewarm
But a mans opposition always inclined her to the suffrage side she had a curious feeling of loyalty in seeing the more aggressive women through
Capes was irritatingly judicial in the matter neither absurdly against in which case one might have smashed him or hopelessly undecided but tepidly sceptical
Miss Klegg and the youngest girl made a vigorous attack on Miss Garvice who had said she thought women lost something infinitely precious by mingling in the conflicts of life
The discussion wandered and was punctuated with bread and butter
Capes was inclined to support Miss Klegg until Miss Garvice cornered him by quoting him against himself and citing a recent paper in the Nineteenth Century in which following Atkinson he had made a vigorous and damaging attack on Lester Wards case for the primitive matriarchate and the predominant importance of the female throughout the animal kingdom
Ann Veronica was not aware of this literary side of her teacher she had a little tinge of annoyance at Miss Garvices advantage
Afterwards she hunted up the article in question and it seemed to her quite delightfully written and argued
Capes had the gift of easy unaffected writing coupled with very clear and logical thinking and to follow his written thought gave her the sensation of cutting things with a perfectly new perfectly sharp knife
She found herself anxious to read more of him and the next Wednesday she went to the British Museum and hunted first among the halfcrown magazines for his essays and then through various scientific quarterlies for his research papers
The ordinary research paper when it is not extravagant theorizing is apt to be rather sawdusty in texture and Ann Veronica was delighted to find the same easy and confident luminosity that distinguished his work for the general reader
She returned to these latter and at the back of her mind as she looked them over again was a very distinct resolve to quote them after the manner of Miss Garvice at the very first opportunity
When she got home to her lodgings that evening she reflected with something like surprise upon her halfdays employment and decided that it showed nothing more nor less than that Capes was a really very interesting person indeed
And then she fell into a musing about Capes
She wondered why he was so distinctive so unlike other men and it never occurred to her for some time that this might be because she was falling in love with him
Part 5 Yet Ann Veronica was thinking a very great deal about love
A dozen shynesses and intellectual barriers were being outflanked or broken down in her mind
All the influences about her worked with her own predisposition and against all the traditions of her home and upbringing to deal with the facts of life in an unabashed manner
Ramage by a hundred skilful hints had led her to realize that the problem of her own life was inseparably associated with and indeed only one special case of the problems of any womans life and that the problem of a womans life is love
A young man comes into life asking how best he may place himself Ramage had said a woman comes into life thinking instinctively how best she may give herself
She noted that as a good saying and it germinated and spread tentacles of explanation through her brain
The biological laboratory perpetually viewing life as pairing and breeding and selection and again pairing and breeding seemed only a translated generalization of that assertion
And all the talk of the Miniver people and the Widgett people seemed always to be like a ship in adverse weather on the lee shore of love
For seven years said Ann Veronica I have been trying to keep myself from thinking about love



I have been training myself to look askance at beautiful things
She gave herself permission now to look at this squarely
She made herself a private declaration of liberty
This is mere nonsense mere tonguetied fear
she said
This is the slavery of the veiled life
I might as well be at Morningside Park
This business of love is the supreme affair in life it is the womans one event and crisis that makes up for all her other restrictions and I coweras we all cowerwith a blushing and paralyzed mind until it overtakes me



Ill be hanged if I do
But she could not talk freely about love she found for all that manumission
Ramage seemed always fencing about the forbidden topic probing for openings and she wondered why she did not give him them
But something instinctive prevented that and with the finest resolve not to be silly and prudish she found that whenever he became at all bold in this matter she became severely scientific and impersonal almost entomological indeed in her method she killed every remark as he made it and pinned it out for examination
In the biological laboratory that was their invincible tone
But she disapproved more and more of her own mental austerity
Here was an experienced man of the world her friend who evidently took a great interest in this supreme topic and was willing to give her the benefit of his experiences
Why should not she be at her ease with him
Why should not she know things
It is hard enough anyhow for a human being to learn she decided but it is a dozen times more difficult than it need be because of all this locking of the lips and thoughts
She contrived to break down the barriers of shyness at last in one direction and talked one night of love and the facts of love with Miss Miniver
But Miss Miniver was highly unsatisfactory
She repeated phrases of Mrs Goopess Advanced people she said with an air of great elucidation tend to GENERALIZE love
He prayeth best who loveth bestall things both great and small
For my own part I go about loving
Yes but men said Ann Veronica plunging dont you want the love of men
For some seconds they remained silent both shocked by this question
Miss Miniver looked over her glasses at her friend almost balefully
NO
she said at last with something in her voice that reminded Ann Veronica of a sprung tennisracket
Ive been through all that she went on after a pause
She spoke slowly
I have never yet met a man whose intellect I could respect
Ann Veronica looked at her thoughtfully for a moment and decided to persist on principle
But if you had
she said
I cant imagine it said Miss Miniver
And think thinkher voice sankof the horrible coarseness
What coarseness
said Ann Veronica
My dear Vee
Her voice became very low
Dont you know
Oh
I know Well Her face was an unaccustomed pink
Ann Veronica ignored her friends confusion
Dont we all rather humbug about the coarseness
All we women I mean said she
She decided to go on after a momentary halt
We pretend bodies are ugly
Really they are the most beautiful things in the world
We pretend we never think of everything that makes us what we are
No cried Miss Miniver almost vehemently
You are wrong
I did not think you thought such things
Bodies
Bodies
Horrible things
We are souls
Love lives on a higher plane
We are not animals
If ever I did meet a man I could love I should love him her voice dropped againplatonically
She made her glasses glint
Absolutely platonically she said
Soul to soul
She turned her face to the fire gripped her hands upon her elbows and drew her thin shoulders together in a shrug
Ugh
she said
Ann Veronica watched her and wondered about her
We do not want the men said Miss Miniver we do not want them with their sneers and loud laughter
Empty silly coarse brutes
Brutes
They are the brute still with us
Science some day may teach us a way to do without them
It is only the women matter
It is not every sort of creature needsthese males
Some have no males
Theres greenfly admitted Ann Veronica
And even then The conversation hung for a thoughtful moment
Ann Veronica readjusted her chin on her hand
I wonder which of us is right she said
I havent a scrapof this sort of aversion
Tolstoy is so good about this said Miss Miniver regardless of her friends attitude
He sees through it all
The Higher Life and the Lower
He sees men all defiled by coarse thoughts coarse ways of living cruelties
Simply because they are hardened byby bestiality and poisoned by the juices of meat slain in anger and fermented drinksfancy
drinks that have been swarmed in by thousands and thousands of horrible little bacteria
Its yeast said Ann Veronicaa vegetable
Its all the same said Miss Miniver
And then they are swollen up and inflamed and drunken with matter
They are blinded to all fine and subtle thingsthey look at life with bloodshot eyes and dilated nostrils
They are arbitrary and unjust and dogmatic and brutish and lustful
But do you really think mens minds are altered by the food they eat
I know it said Miss Miniver
Experte credo
When I am leading a true life a pure and simple life free of all stimulants and excitements I thinkI think oh
with pellucid clearness but if I so much as take a mouthful of meator anythingthe mirror is all blurred
Part 6 Then arising she knew not how like a newborn appetite came a craving in Ann Veronica for the sight and sound of beauty
It was as if her aesthetic sense had become inflamed
Her mind turned and accused itself of having been cold and hard
She began to look for beauty and discover it in unexpected aspects and places
Hitherto she had seen it chiefly in pictures and other works of art incidentally and as a thing taken out of life
Now the sense of beauty was spreading to a multitude of hitherto unsuspected aspects of the world about her
The thought of beauty became an obsession
It interwove with her biological work
She found herself asking more and more curiously Why on the principle of the survival of the fittest have I any sense of beauty at all
That enabled her to go on thinking about beauty when it seemed to her right that she should be thinking about biology
She was very greatly exercised by the two systems of valuesthe two series of explanations that her comparative anatomy on the one hand and her sense of beauty on the other set going in her thoughts
She could not make up her mind which was the finer more elemental thing which gave its values to the other
Was it that the struggle of things to survive produced as a sort of necessary byproduct these intense preferences and appreciations or was it that some mystical outer thing some great force drove life beautyward even in spite of expediency regardless of survival value and all the manifest discretions of life
She went to Capes with that riddle and put it to him very carefully and clearly and he talked wellhe always talked at some length when she took a difficulty to himand sent her to a various literature upon the markings of butterflies the incomprehensible elaboration and splendor of birds of Paradise and hummingbirds plumes the patterning of tigers and a leopards spots
He was interesting and inconclusive and the original papers to which he referred her discursive were at best only suggestive
Afterward one afternoon he hovered about her and came and sat beside her and talked of beauty and the riddle of beauty for some time
He displayed a quite unprofessional vein of mysticism in the matter
He contrasted with Russell whose intellectual methods were so to speak sceptically dogmatic
Their talk drifted to the beauty of music and they took that up again at teatime
But as the students sat about Miss Garvices teapot and drank tea or smoked cigarettes the talk got away from Capes
The Scotchman informed Ann Veronica that your view of beauty necessarily depended on your metaphysical premises and the young man with the Russelllike hair became anxious to distinguish himself by telling the Japanese student that Western art was symmetrical and Eastern art asymmetrical and that among the higher organisms the tendency was toward an external symmetry veiling an internal want of balance
Ann Veronica decided she would have to go on with Capes another day and looking up discovered him sitting on a stool with his hands in his pockets and his head a little on one side regarding her with a thoughtful expression
She met his eye for a moment in curious surprise
He turned his eyes and stared at Miss Garvice like one who wakes from a reverie and then got up and strolled down the laboratory toward his refuge the preparationroom
Part 7 Then one day a little thing happened that clothed itself in significance
She had been working upon a ribbon of microtome sections of the developing salamander and he came to see what she had made of them
She stood up and he sat down at the microscope and for a time he was busy scrutinizing one section after another
She looked down at him and saw that the sunlight was gleaming from his cheeks and that all over his cheeks was a fine golden down of delicate hairs
And at the sight something leaped within her
Something changed for her
She became aware of his presence as she had never been aware of any human being in her life before
She became aware of the modelling of his ear of the muscles of his neck and the textures of the hair that came off his brow the soft minute curve of eyelid that she could just see beyond his brow she perceived all these familiar objects as though they were acutely beautiful things
They WERE she realized acutely beautiful things
Her sense followed the shoulders under his coat down to where his flexible sensitivelooking hand rested lightly upon the table
She felt him as something solid and strong and trustworthy beyond measure
The perception of him flooded her being
He got up
Heres something rather good he said and with a start and an effort she took his place at the microscope while he stood beside her and almost leaning over her
She found she was trembling at his nearness and full of a thrilling dread that he might touch her
She pulled herself together and put her eye to the eyepiece
You see the pointer
he asked
I see the pointer she said
Its like this he said and dragged a stool beside her and sat down with his elbow four inches from hers and made a sketch
Then he got up and left her
She had a feeling at his departure as of an immense cavity of something enormously gone she could not tell whether it was infinite regret or infinite relief



But now Ann Veronica knew what was the matter with her
Part 8 And as she sat on her bed that night musing and halfundressed she began to run one hand down her arm and scrutinize the soft flow of muscle under her skin
She thought of the marvellous beauty of skin and all the delightfulness of living texture
Oh the back of her arm she found the faintest down of hair in the world
Etherialized monkey she said
She held out her arm straight before her and turned her hand this way and that
Why should one pretend
she whispered
Why should one pretend
Think of all the beauty in the world that is covered up and overlaid
She glanced shyly at the mirror above her dressingtable and then about her at the furniture as though it might penetrate to the thoughts that peeped in her mind
I wonder said Ann Veronica at last if I am beautiful
I wonder if I shall ever shine like a light like a translucent goddess I wonder I suppose girls and women have prayed for this have come to this In Babylon in Nineveh
Why shouldnt one face the facts of ones self
She stood up
She posed herself before her mirror and surveyed herself with gravely thoughtful gravely critical and yet admiring eyes
And after all I am just one common person
She watched the throb of the arteries in the stem of her neck and put her hand at last gently and almost timidly to where her heart beat beneath her breast
Part 9 The realization that she was in love flooded Ann Veronicas mind and altered the quality of all its topics
She began to think persistently of Capes and it seemed to her now that for some weeks at least she must have been thinking persistently of him unawares
She was surprised to find how stored her mind was with impressions and memories of him how vividly she remembered his gestures and little things that he had said
It occurred to her that it was absurd and wrong to be so continuously thinking of one engrossing topic and she made a strenuous effort to force her mind to other questions
But it was extraordinary what seemingly irrelevant things could restore her to the thought of Capes again
And when she went to sleep then always Capes became the novel and wonderful guest of her dreams
For a time it really seemed allsufficient to her that she should love
That Capes should love her seemed beyond the compass of her imagination
Indeed she did not want to think of him as loving her
She wanted to think of him as her beloved person to be near him and watch him to have him going about doing this and that saying this and that unconscious of her while she too remained unconscious of herself
To think of him as loving her would make all that different
Then he would turn his face to her and she would have to think of herself in his eyes
She would become defensivewhat she did would be the thing that mattered
He would require things of her and she would be passionately concerned to meet his requirements
Loving was better than that
Loving was selfforgetfulness pure delighting in another human being
She felt that with Capes near to her she would be content always to go on loving
She went next day to the schools and her world seemed all made of happiness just worked up roughly into shapes and occasions and duties
She found she could do her microscope work all the better for being in love
She winced when first she heard the preparationroom door open and Capes came down the laboratory but when at last he reached her she was selfpossessed
She put a stool for him at a little distance from her own and after he had seen the days work he hesitated and then plunged into a resumption of their discussion about beauty
I think he said I was a little too mystical about beauty the other day
I like the mystical way she said
Our business here is the right way
Ive been thinking you know Im not sure that primarily the perception of beauty isnt just intensity of feeling free from pain intensity of perception without any tissue destruction
I like the mystical way better said Ann Veronica and thought
A number of beautiful things are not intense
But delicacy for example may be intensely perceived
But why is one face beautiful and another not
objected Ann Veronica on your theory any two faces side by side in the sunlight ought to be equally beautiful
One must get them with exactly the same intensity
He did not agree with that
I dont mean simply intensity of sensation
I said intensity of perception
You may perceive harmony proportion rhythm intensely
They are things faint and slight in themselves as physical facts but they are like the detonator of a bomb they let loose the explosive
Theres the internal factor as well as the external



I dont know if I express myself clearly
I mean that the point is that vividness of perception is the essential factor of beauty but of course vividness may be created by a whisper
That brings us back said Ann Veronica to the mystery
Why should some things and not others open the deeps
Well that might after all be an outcome of selection like the preference for blue flowers which are not nearly so bright as yellow of some insects
That doesnt explain sunsets
Not quite so easily as it explains an insect alighting on colored paper
But perhaps if people didnt like clear bright healthy eyeswhich is biologically understandablethey couldnt like precious stones
One thing may be a necessary collateral of the others
And after all a fine clear sky of bright colors is the signal to come out of hiding and rejoice and go on with life
Hm
said Ann Veronica and shook her head
Capes smiled cheerfully with his eyes meeting hers
I throw it out in passing he said
What I am after is that beauty isnt a special inserted sort of thing thats my idea
Its just life pure life life nascent running clear and strong
He stood up to go on to the next student
Theres morbid beauty said Ann Veronica
I wonder if there is
said Capes and paused and then bent down over the boy who wore his hair like Russell
Ann Veronica surveyed his sloping back for a moment and then drew her microscope toward her
Then for a time she sat very still
She felt that she had passed a difficult corner and that now she could go on talking with him again just as she had been used to do before she understood what was the matter with her



She had one idea she found very clear in her mindthat she would get a Research Scholarship and so contrive another year in the laboratory
Now I see what everything means said Ann Veronica to herself and it really felt for some days as though the secret of the universe that had been wrapped and hidden from her so obstinately was at last altogether displayed
CHAPTER THE NINTH DISCORDS Part 1 One afternoon soon after Ann Veronicas great discovery a telegram came into the laboratory for her
It ran   Bored  and  nothing  to  do    will  you  dine  with  me    tonight  somewhere  and  talk  I    shall  be  grateful  Ramage    Ann Veronica was rather pleased by this
She had not seen Ramage for ten or eleven days and she was quite ready for a gossip with him
And now her mind was so full of the thought that she was in lovein lovethat marvellous state
that I really believe she had some dim idea of talking to him about it
At any rate it would be good to hear him saying the sort of things he didperhaps now she would grasp them betterwith this worldshaking secret brandishing itself about inside her head within a yard of him
She was sorry to find Ramage a little disposed to be melancholy
I have made over seven hundred pounds in the last week he said
Thats exhilarating said Ann Veronica
Not a bit of it he said its only a score in a game
Its a score you can buy all sorts of things with
Nothing that one wants
He turned to the waiter who held a winecard
Nothing can cheer me he said except champagne
He meditated
This he said and then No
Is this sweeter
Very well
Everything goes well with me he said folding his arms under him and regarding Ann Veronica with the slightly projecting eyes wide open
And Im not happy
I believe Im in love
He leaned back for his soup
Presently he resumed I believe I must be in love
You cant be that said Ann Veronica wisely
How do you know
Well it isnt exactly a depressing state is it
YOU dont know
One has theories said Ann Veronica radiantly
Oh theories
Being in love is a fact
It ought to make one happy
Its an unresta longing Whats that
The waiter had intervened
Parmesantake it away
He glanced at Ann Veronicas face and it seemed to him that she really was exceptionally radiant
He wondered why she thought love made people happy and began to talk of the smilax and pinks that adorned the table
He filled her glass with champagne
You MUST he said because of my depression
They were eating quails when they returned to the topic of love
What made you think he said abruptly with the gleam of avidity in his face that love makes people happy
I know it must
But how
He was she thought a little too insistent
Women know these things by instinct she answered
I wonder he said if women do know things by instinct
I have my doubts about feminine instinct
Its one of our conventional superstitions
A woman is supposed to know when a man is in love with her
Do you think she does
Ann Veronica picked among her salad with a judicial expression of face
I think she would she decided
Ah
said Ramage impressively
Ann Veronica looked up at him and found him regarding her with eyes that were almost woebegone and into which indeed he was trying to throw much more expression than they could carry
There was a little pause between them full for Ann Veronica of rapid elusive suspicions and intimations
Perhaps one talks nonsense about a womans instinct she said
Its a way of avoiding explanations
And girls and women perhaps are different
I dont know
I dont suppose a girl can tell if a man is in love with her or not in love with her
Her mind went off to Capes
Her thoughts took words for themselves
She cant
I suppose it depends on her own state of mind
If one wants a thing very much perhaps one is inclined to think one cant have it
I suppose if one were to love some one one would feel doubtful
And if one were to love some one very much its just so that one would be blindest just when one wanted most to see
She stopped abruptly afraid that Ramage might be able to infer Capes from the things she had said and indeed his face was very eager
Yes
he said
Ann Veronica blushed
Thats all she said Im afraid Im a little confused about these things
Ramage looked at her and then fell into deep reflection as the waiter came to paragraph their talk again
Have you ever been to the opera Ann Veronica
said Ramage
Once or twice
Shall we go now
I think I would like to listen to music
What is there
Tristan
Ive never heard Tristan and Isolde
That settles it
Well go
Theres sure to be a place somewhere
Its rather jolly of you said Ann Veronica
Its jolly of you to come said Ramage
So presently they got into a hansom together and Ann Veronica sat back feeling very luxurious and pleasant and looked at the light and stir and misty glitter of the street traffic from under slightly drooping eyelids while Ramage sat closer to her than he need have done and glanced ever and again at her face and made to speak and said nothing
And when they got to Covent Garden Ramage secured one of the little upper boxes and they came into it as the overture began
Ann Veronica took off her jacket and sat down in the corner chair and leaned forward to look into the great hazy warm brown cavity of the house and Ramage placed his chair to sit beside her and near her facing the stage
The music took hold of her slowly as her eyes wandered from the indistinct still ranks of the audience to the little busy orchestra with its quivering violins its methodical movements of brown and silver instruments its brightly lit scores and shaded lights
She had never been to the opera before except as one of a congested mass of people in the cheaper seats and with backs and heads and womens hats for the frame of the spectacle there was by contrast a fine large sense of space and ease in her present position
The curtain rose out of the concluding bars of the overture and revealed Isolde on the prow of the barbaric ship
The voice of the young seaman came floating down from the masthead and the story of the immortal lovers had begun
She knew the story only imperfectly and followed it now with a passionate and deepening interest
The splendid voices sang on from phase to phase of loves unfolding the ship drove across the sea to the beating rhythm of the rowers
The lovers broke into passionate knowledge of themselves and each other and then a jarring intervention came King Mark amidst the shouts of the sailormen and stood beside them
The curtain came festooning slowly down the music ceased the lights in the auditorium glowed out and Ann Veronica woke out of her confused dream of involuntary and commanding love in a glory of sound and colors to discover that Ramage was sitting close beside her with one hand resting lightly on her waist
She made a quick movement and the hand fell away
By God
Ann Veronica he said sighing deeply
This stirs one
She sat quite still looking at him
I wish you and I had drunk that love potion he said
She found no ready reply to that and he went on This music is the food of love
It makes me desire life beyond measure
Life
Life and love
It makes me want to be always young always strong always devoting my lifeand dying splendidly
It is very beautiful said Ann Veronica in a low tone
They said no more for a moment and each was now acutely aware of the other
Ann Veronica was excited and puzzled with a sense of a strange and disconcerting new light breaking over her relations with Ramage
She had never thought of him at all in that way before
It did not shock her it amazed her interested her beyond measure
But also this must not go on
She felt he was going to say something moresomething still more personal and intimate
She was curious and at the same time clearly resolved she must not hear it
She felt she must get him talking upon some impersonal theme at any cost
She snatched about in her mind
What is the exact force of a motif
she asked at random
Before I heard much Wagnerian music I heard enthusiastic descriptions of it from a mistress I didnt like at school
She gave me an impression of a sort of patched quilt little bits of patterned stuff coming up again and again
She stopped with an air of interrogation
Ramage looked at her for a long and discriminating interval without speaking
He seemed to be hesitating between two courses of action
I dont know much about the technique of music he said at last with his eyes upon her
Its a matter of feeling with me
He contradicted himself by plunging into an exposition of motifs
By a tacit agreement they ignored the significant thing between them ignored the slipping away of the ground on which they had stood together hitherto



All through the love music of the second act until the hunting horns of Mark break in upon the dream Ann Veronicas consciousness was flooded with the perception of a man close beside her preparing some new thing to say to her preparing perhaps to touch her stretching hungry invisible tentacles about her
She tried to think what she should do in this eventuality or that
Her mind had been and was full of the thought of Capes a huge generalized Capeslover
And in some incomprehensible way Ramage was confused with Capes she had a grotesque disposition to persuade herself that this was really Capes who surrounded her as it were with wings of desire
The fact that it was her trusted friend making illicit love to her remained in spite of all her effort an insignificant thing in her mind
The music confused and distracted her and made her struggle against a feeling of intoxication
Her head swam
That was the inconvenience of it her head was swimming
The music throbbed into the warnings that preceded the kings irruption
Abruptly he gripped her wrist
I love you Ann Veronica
I love youwith all my heart and soul
She put her face closer to his
She felt the warm nearness of his
DONT
she said and wrenched her wrist from his retaining hand
My God
Ann Veronica he said struggling to keep his hold upon her my God
Tell metell me nowtell me you love me
His expression was as it were rapaciously furtive
She answered in whispers for there was the white arm of a woman in the next box peeping beyond the partition within a yard of him
My hand
This isnt the place
He released her hand and talked in eager undertones against an auditory background of urgency and distress
Ann Veronica he said I tell you this is love
I love the soles of your feet
I love your very breath
I have tried not to tell youtried to be simply your friend
It is no good
I want you
I worship you
I would do anythingI would give anything to make you mine



Do you hear me
Do you hear what I am saying



Love
He held her arm and abandoned it again at her quick defensive movement
For a long time neither spoke again
She sat drawn together in her chair in the corner of the box at a loss what to say or doafraid curious perplexed
It seemed to her that it was her duty to get up and clamor to go home to her room to protest against his advances as an insult
But she did not in the least want to do that
These sweeping dignities were not within the compass of her will she remembered she liked Ramage and owed things to him and she was interestedshe was profoundly interested
He was in love with her
She tried to grasp all the welter of values in the situation simultaneously and draw some conclusion from their disorder
He began to talk again in quick undertones that she could not clearly hear
I have loved you he was saying ever since you sat on that gate and talked
I have always loved you
I dont care what divides us
I dont care what else there is in the world
I want you beyond measure or reckoning



His voice rose and fell amidst the music and the singing of Tristan and King Mark like a voice heard in a badly connected telephone
She stared at his pleading face
She turned to the stage and Tristan was wounded in Kurvenals arms with Isolde at his feet and King Mark the incarnation of masculine force and obligation the masculine creditor of love and beauty stood over him and the second climax was ending in wreaths and reek of melodies and then the curtain was coming down in a series of short rushes the music had ended and the people were stirring and breaking out into applause and the lights of the auditorium were resuming
The lightingup pierced the obscurity of the box and Ramage stopped his urgent flow of words abruptly and sat back
This helped to restore Ann Veronicas selfcommand
She turned her eyes to him again and saw her late friend and pleasant and trusted companion who had seen fit suddenly to change into a lover babbling interesting inacceptable things
He looked eager and flushed and troubled
His eyes caught at hers with passionate inquiries
Tell me he said speak to me
She realized it was possible to be sorry for himacutely sorry for the situation
Of course this thing was absolutely impossible
But she was disturbed mysteriously disturbed
She remembered abruptly that she was really living upon his money
She leaned forward and addressed him
Mr Ramage she said please dont talk like this
He made to speak and did not
I dont want you to do it to go on talking to me
I dont want to hear you
If I had known that you had meant to talk like this I wouldnt have come here
But how can I help it
How can I keep silence
Please
she insisted
Please not now
I MUST talk with you
I must say what I have to say
But not nownot here
It came he said
I never planned it And now I have begun She felt acutely that he was entitled to explanations and as acutely that explanations were impossible that night
She wanted to think
Mr Ramage she said I cant Not now
Will you please Not now or I must go
He stared at her trying to guess at the mystery of her thoughts
You dont want to go
No
But I mustI ought I MUST talk about this
Indeed I must
Not now
But I love you
I love youunendurably
Then dont talk to me now
I dont want you to talk to me now
There is a place This isnt the place
You have misunderstood
I cant explain They regarded one another each blinded to the other
Forgive me he decided to say at last and his voice had a little quiver of emotion and he laid his hand on hers upon her knee
I am the most foolish of men
I was stupidstupid and impulsive beyond measure to burst upon you in this way
II am a love sick idiot and not accountable for my actions
Will you forgive meif I say no more
She looked at him with perplexed earnest eyes
Pretend he said that all I have said hasnt been said
And let us go on with our evening
Why not
Imagine Ive had a fit of hysteriaand that Ive come round
Yes she said and abruptly she liked him enormously
She felt this was the sensible way out of this oddly sinister situation
He still watched her and questioned her
And let us have a talk about thissome other time
Somewhere where we can talk without interruption
Will you
She thought and it seemed to him she had never looked so selfdisciplined and deliberate and beautiful
Yes she said that is what we ought to do
But now she doubted again of the quality of the armistice they had just made
He had a wild impulse to shout
Agreed he said with queer exaltation and his grip tightened on her hand
And tonight we are friends
We are friends said Ann Veronica and drew her hand quickly away from him
Tonight we are as we have always been
Except that this music we have been swimming in is divine
While I have been pestering you have you heard it
At least you heard the first act
And all the third act is lovesick music
Tristan dying and Isolde coming to crown his death
Wagner had just been in love when he wrote it all
It begins with that queer piccolo solo
Now I shall never hear it but what this evening will come pouring back over me
The lights sank the prelude to the third act was beginning the music rose and fell in crowded intimations of lovers separatedlovers separated with scars and memories between them and the curtain went reefing up to display Tristan lying wounded on his couch and the shepherd crouching with his pipe
Part 2 They had their explanations the next evening but they were explanations in quite other terms than Ann Veronica had anticipated quite other and much more startling and illuminating terms
Ramage came for her at her lodgings and she met him graciously and kindly as a queen who knows she must needs give sorrow to a faithful liege
She was unusually soft and gentle in her manner to him
He was wearing a new silk hat with a slightly more generous brim than its predecessor and it suited his type of face robbed his dark eyes a little of their aggressiveness and gave him a solid and dignified and benevolent air
A faint anticipation of triumph showed in his manner and a subdued excitement
Well go to a place where we can have a private room he said
Thenthen we can talk things out
So they went this time to the Rococo in Germain Street and upstairs to a landing upon which stood a baldheaded waiter with whiskers like a French admiral and discretion beyond all limits in his manner
He seemed to have expected them
He ushered them with an amiable flat hand into a minute apartment with a little gasstove a silk crimsoncovered sofa and a bright little table gay with napery and hothouse flowers
Odd little room said Ann Veronica dimly apprehending that obtrusive sofa
One can talk without undertones so to speak said Ramage
Itsprivate
He stood looking at the preparations before them with an unusual preoccupation of manner then roused himself to take her jacket a little awkwardly and hand it to the waiter who hung it in the corner of the room
It appeared he had already ordered dinner and wine and the whiskered waiter waved in his subordinate with the soup forthwith
Im going to talk of indifferent themes said Ramage a little fussily until these interruptions of the service are over
Thenthen we shall be together



How did you like Tristan
Ann Veronica paused the fraction of a second before her reply came
I thought much of it amazingly beautiful
Isnt it
And to think that man got it all out of the poorest little lovestory for a respectable titled lady
Have you read of it
Never
It gives in a nutshell the miracle of art and the imagination
You get this queer irascible musician quite impossibly and unfortunately in love with a wealthy patroness and then out of his brain comes THIS a tapestry of glorious music setting out love to lovers lovers who love in spite of all that is wise and respectable and right
Ann Veronica thought
She did not want to seem to shrink from conversation but all sorts of odd questions were running through her mind
I wonder why people in love are so defiant so careless of other considerations
The very hares grow brave
I suppose because it IS the chief thing in life
He stopped and said earnestly It is the chief thing in life and everything else goes down before it
Everything my dear everything



But we have got to talk upon indifferent themes until we have done with this blond young gentleman from Bavaria



The dinner came to an end at last and the whiskered waiter presented his bill and evacuated the apartment and closed the door behind him with an almost ostentatious discretion
Ramage stood up and suddenly turned the key in the door in an offhand manner
Now he said no one can blunder in upon us
We are alone and we can say and do what we please
We two
He stood still looking at her
Ann Veronica tried to seem absolutely unconcerned
The turning of the key startled her but she did not see how she could make an objection
She felt she had stepped into a world of unknown usages
I have waited for this he said and stood quite still looking at her until the silence became oppressive
Wont you sit down she said and tell me what you want to say
Her voice was flat and faint
Suddenly she had become afraid
She struggled not to be afraid
After all what could happen
He was looking at her very hard and earnestly
Ann Veronica he said
Then before she could say a word to arrest him he was at her side
Dont
she said weakly as he had bent down and put one arm about her and seized her hands with his disengaged hand and kissed herkissed her almost upon her lips
He seemed to do ten things before she could think to do one to leap upon her and take possession
Ann Veronicas universe which had never been altogether so respectful to her as she could have wished gave a shout and whirled head over heels
Everything in the world had changed for her
If hate could kill Ramage would have been killed by a flash of hate
Mr
Ramage
she cried and struggled to her feet
My darling
he said clasping her resolutely in his arms my dearest
Mr
Ramage
she began and his mouth sealed hers and his breath was mixed with her breath
Her eye met his four inches away and his was glaring immense and full of resolution a stupendous monster of an eye
She shut her lips hard her jaw hardened and she set herself to struggle with him
She wrenched her head away from his grip and got her arm between his chest and hers
They began to wrestle fiercely
Each became frightfully aware of the other as a plastic energetic body of the strong muscles of neck against cheek of hands gripping shoulderblade and waist
How dare you
she panted with her world screaming and grimacing insult at her
How dare you
They were both astonished at the others strength
Perhaps Ramage was the more astonished
Ann Veronica had been an ardent hockey player and had had a course of jiujitsu in the High School
Her defence ceased rapidly to be in any sense ladylike and became vigorous and effective a strand of black hair that had escaped its hairpins came athwart Ramages eyes and then the knuckles of a small but very hardly clinched fist had thrust itself with extreme effectiveness and painfulness under his jawbone and ear
Let go
said Ann Veronica through her teeth strenuously inflicting agony and he cried out sharply and let go and receded a pace
NOW
said Ann Veronica
Why did you dare to do that
Part 3 Each of them stared at the other set in a universe that had changed its system of values with kaleidoscopic completeness
She was flushed and her eyes were bright and angry her breath came sobbing and her hair was all abroad in wandering strands of black
He too was flushed and ruffled one side of his collar had slipped from its stud and he held a hand to the corner of his jaw
You vixen
said Mr Ramage speaking the simplest first thought of his heart
You had no right panted Ann Veronica
Why on earth he asked did you hurt me like that
Ann Veronica did her best to think she had not deliberately attempted to cause him pain
She ignored his question
I never dreamt
she said
What on earth did you expect me to do then
he asked
Part 4 Interpretation came pouring down upon her almost blindingly she understood now the room the waiter the whole situation
She understood
She leaped to a world of shabby knowledge of furtive base realizations
She wanted to cry out upon herself for the uttermost fool in existence
I thought you wanted to have a talk to me she said
I wanted to make love to you
You knew it he added in her momentary silence
You said you were in love with me said Ann Veronica I wanted to explain I said I loved and wanted you
The brutality of his first astonishment was evaporating
I am in love with you
You know I am in love with you
And then you goand half throttle me



I believe youve crushed a gland or something
It feels like it
I am sorry said Ann Veronica
What else was I to do
For some seconds she stood watching him
and both were thinking very quickly
Her state of mind would have seemed altogether discreditable to her grandmother
She ought to have been disposed to faint and scream at all these happenings she ought to have maintained a front of outraged dignity to veil the sinking of her heart
I would like to have to tell it so
But indeed that is not at all a good description of her attitude
She was an indignant queen no doubt she was alarmed and disgusted within limits but she was highly excited and there was something some low adventurous strain in her being some element subtle at least if base going about the rioting ways and crowded insurgent meetingplaces of her mind declaring that the whole affair was after allthey are the only words that express ita very great lark indeed
At the bottom of her heart she was not a bit afraid of Ramage
She had unaccountable gleams of sympathy with and liking for him
And the grotesquest fact was that she did not so much loathe as experience with a quite critical condemnation this strange sensation of being kissed
Never before had any human being kissed her lips



It was only some hours after that these ambiguous elements evaporated and vanished and loathing came and she really began to be thoroughly sick and ashamed of the whole disgraceful quarrel and scuffle
He for his part was trying to grasp the series of unexpected reactions that had so wrecked their teteatete
He had meant to be master of his fate that evening and it had escaped him altogether
It had as it were blown up at the concussion of his first step
It dawned upon him that he had been abominably used by Ann Veronica
Look here he said I brought you here to make love to you
I didnt understandyour idea of making love
You had better let me go again
Not yet he said
I do love you
I love you all the more for the streak of sheer devil in you



You are the most beautiful the most desirable thing I have ever met in this world
It was good to kiss you even at the price
But by Jove
you are fierce
You are like those Roman women who carry stilettos in their hair
I came here to talk reasonably Mr Ramage
It is abominable What is the use of keeping up this note of indignation Ann Veronica
Here I am
I am your lover burning for you
I mean to have you
Dont frown me off now
Dont go back into Victorian respectability and pretend you dont know and you cant think and all the rest of it
One comes at last to the step from dreams to reality
This is your moment
No one will ever love you as I love you now
I have been dreaming of your body and you night after night
I have been imaging Mr Ramage I came here I didnt suppose for one moment you would dare Nonsense
That is your mistake
You are too intellectual
You want to do everything with your mind
You are afraid of kisses
You are afraid of the warmth in your blood
Its just because all that side of your life hasnt fairly begun
He made a step toward her
Mr Ramage she said sharply I have to make it plain to you
I dont think you understand
I dont love you
I dont
I cant love you
I love some one else
It is repulsive
It disgusts me that you should touch me
He stared in amazement at this new aspect of the situation
You love some one else
he repeated
I love some one else
I could not dream of loving you
And then he flashed his whole conception of the relations of men and women upon her in one astonishing question
His hand went with an almost instinctive inquiry to his jawbone again
Then why the devil he demanded do you let me stand you dinners and the operaand why do you come to a cabinet particulier with me
He became radiant with anger
You mean to tell me he said that you have a lover
While I have been keeping you
Yeskeeping you
This view of life he hurled at her as if it were an offensive missile
It stunned her
She felt she must fly before it and could no longer do so
She did not think for one moment what interpretation he might put upon the word lover
Mr Ramage she said clinging to her one point I want to get out of this horrible little room
It has all been a mistake
I have been stupid and foolish
Will you unlock that door
Never
he said
Confound your lover
Look here
Do you really think I am going to run you while he makes love to you
No fear
I never heard of anything so cool
If he wants you let him get you
Youre mine
Ive paid for you and helped you and Im going to conquer you somehowif I have to break you to do it
Hitherto youve seen only my easy kindly side
But now confound it
how can you prevent it
I will kiss you
You wont
said Ann Veronica with the clearest note of determination
He seemed to be about to move toward her
She stepped back quickly and her hand knocked a wineglass from the table to smash noisily on the floor
She caught at the idea
If you come a step nearer to me she said I will smash every glass on this table
Then by God
he said youll be locked up
Ann Veronica was disconcerted for a moment
She had a vision of policemen reproving magistrates a crowded court public disgrace
She saw her aunt in tears her father whitefaced and hard hit
Dont come nearer
she said
There was a discreet knocking at the door and Ramages face changed
No she said under her breath you cant face it
And she knew that she was safe
He went to the door
Its all right he said reassuringly to the inquirer without
Ann Veronica glanced at the mirror to discover a flushed and dishevelled disorder
She began at once a hasty readjustment of her hair while Ramage parleyed with inaudible interrogations
A glass slipped from the table he explained



Non
Fas du tout
Non



Niente



Bitte



Oui dans la note



Presently
Presently
That conversation ended and he turned to her again
I am going she said grimly with three hairpins in her mouth
She took her hat from the peg in the corner and began to put it on
He regarded that perennial miracle of pinning with wrathful eyes
Look here Ann Veronica he began
I want a plain word with you about all this
Do you mean to tell me you didnt understand why I wanted you to come here
Not a bit of it said Ann Veronica stoutly
You didnt expect that I should kiss you
How was I to know that a man wouldwould think it was possiblewhen there was nothingno love
How did I know there wasnt love
That silenced her for a moment
And what on earth he said do you think the world is made of
Why do you think I have been doing things for you
The abstract pleasure of goodness
Are you one of the members of that great white sisterhood that takes and does not give
The good accepting woman
Do you really suppose a girl is entitled to live at free quarters on any man she meets without giving any return
I thought said Ann Veronica you were my friend
Friend
What have a man and a girl in common to make them friends
Ask that lover of yours
And even with friends would you have it all Give on one side and all Take on the other



Does HE know I keep you



You wont have a mans lips near you but youll eat out of his hand fast enough
Ann Veronica was stung to helpless anger
Mr Ramage she cried you are outrageous
You understand nothing
You arehorrible
Will you let me go out of this room
No cried Ramage hear me out
Ill have that satisfaction anyhow
You women with your tricks of evasion youre a sex of swindlers
You have all the instinctive dexterity of parasites
You make yourself charming for help
You climb by disappointing men
This lover of yours He doesnt know
cried Ann Veronica
Well you know
Ann Veronica could have wept with vexation
Indeed a note of weeping broke her voice for a moment as she burst out You know as well as I do that money was a loan
Loan
You yourself called it a loan
Euphuism
We both understood that
You shall have every penny of it back
Ill frame itwhen I get it
Ill pay you if I have to work at shirtmaking at threepence an hour
Youll never pay me
You think you will
Its your way of glossing over the ethical position
Its the sort of way a woman always does gloss over her ethical positions
Youre all dependentsall of you
By instinct
Only you good onesshirk
You shirk a straightforward and decent return for what you get from ustaking refuge in purity and delicacy and suchlike when it comes to payment
Mr Ramage said Ann Veronica I want to goNOW
Part 5 But she did not get away just then
Ramages bitterness passed as abruptly as his aggression
Oh Ann Veronica
he cried I cannot let you go like this
You dont understand
You cant possibly understand
He began a confused explanation a perplexing contradictory apology for his urgency and wrath
He loved Ann Veronica he said he was so mad to have her that he defeated himself and did crude and alarming and senseless things
His vicious abusiveness vanished
He suddenly became eloquent and plausible
He did make her perceive something of the acute tormenting desire for her that had arisen in him and possessed him
She stood as it were directed doorward with her eyes watching every movement listening to him repelled by him and yet dimly understanding
At any rate he made it very clear that night that there was an ineradicable discord in life a jarring something that must shatter all her dreams of a way of living for women that would enable them to be free and spacious and friendly with men and that was the passionate predisposition of men to believe that the love of women can be earned and won and controlled and compelled
He flung aside all his talk of help and disinterested friendship as though it had never been even a disguise between them as though from the first it was no more than a fancy dress they had put quite understandingly upon their relationship
He had set out to win her and she had let him start
And at the thought of that other loverhe was convinced that that beloved person was a lover and she found herself unable to say a word to explain to him that this other person the person she loved did not even know of her loveRamage grew angry and savage once more and returned suddenly to gibe and insult
Men do services for the love of women and the woman who takes must pay
Such was the simple code that displayed itself in all his thoughts
He left that arid rule clear of the least mist of refinement or delicacy
That he should pay forty pounds to help this girl who preferred another man was no less in his eyes than a fraud and mockery that made her denial a maddening and outrageous disgrace to him
And this though he was evidently passionately in love with her
For a while he threatened her
You have put all your life in my hands he declared
Think of that check you endorsed
There it isagainst you
I defy you to explain it away
What do you think people will make of that
What will this lover of yours make of that
At intervals Ann Veronica demanded to go declaring her undying resolve to repay him at any cost and made short movements doorward
But at last this ordeal was over and Ramage opened the door
She emerged with a white face and wideopen eyes upon a little redlit landing
She went past three keenly observant and ostentatiously preoccupied waiters down the thickcarpeted staircase and out of the Hotel Rococo that remarkable laboratory of relationships past a tall porter in blue and crimson into a cool clear night
Part 6 When Ann Veronica reached her little bedsittingroom again every nerve in her body was quivering with shame and selfdisgust
She threw hat and coat on the bed and sat down before the fire
And now she said splintering the surviving piece of coal into indignant flamespurting fragments with one dexterous blow what am I to do
Im in a holemess is a better word expresses it better 
Im in a messa nasty mess
a filthy mess
Oh no end of a mess
Do you hear Ann Veronicayoure in a nasty filthy unforgivable mess
Havent I just made a silly mess of things
Forty pounds
I havent got twenty
She got up stamped with her foot and then suddenly remembering the lodger below sat down and wrenched off her boots
This is what comes of being a young woman up to date
By Jove
Im beginning to have my doubts about freedom
You silly young woman Ann Veronica
You silly young woman
The smeariness of the thing
The smeariness of this sort of thing



Mauled about
She fell to rubbing her insulted lips savagely with the back of her hand
Ugh
she said
The young women of Jane Austens time didnt get into this sort of scrape
At leastone thinks so



I wonder if some of them didand it didnt get reported
Aunt Jane had her quiet moments
Most of them didnt anyhow
They were properly brought up and sat still and straight and took the luck fate brought them as gentlewomen should
And they had an idea of what men were like behind all their nicety
They knew they were all Bogey in disguise
I didnt
I didnt
After all For a time her mind ran on daintiness and its defensive restraints as though it was the one desirable thing
That world of fine printed cambrics and escorted maidens of delicate secondary meanings and refined allusiveness presented itself to her imagination with the brightness of a lost paradise as indeed for many women it is a lost paradise
I wonder if there is anything wrong with my manners she said
I wonder if Ive been properly brought up
If I had been quite quiet and white and dignified wouldnt it have been different
Would he have dared



For some creditable moments in her life Ann Veronica was utterly disgusted with herself she was wrung with a passionate and belated desire to move gently to speak softly and ambiguouslyto be in effect prim
Horrible details recurred to her
Why among other things did I put my knuckles in his neckdeliberately to hurt him
She tried to sound the humorous note
Are you aware Ann Veronica you nearly throttled that gentleman
Then she reviled her own foolish way of putting it
You ass and imbecile Ann Veronica
You female cad
Cad
Cad



Why arent you folded up clean in lavenderas every young woman ought to be
What have you been doing with yourself



She raked into the fire with the poker
All of which doesnt help me in the slightest degree to pay back that money
That night was the most intolerable one that Ann Veronica had ever spent
She washed her face with unwonted elaboration before she went to bed
This time there was no doubt she did not sleep
The more she disentangled the lines of her situation the deeper grew her selfdisgust
Occasionally the mere fact of lying in bed became unendurable and she rolled out and marched about her room and whispered abuse of herselfusually until she hit against some article of furniture
Then she would have quiet times in which she would say to herself Now look here
Let me think it all out
For the first time it seemed to her she faced the facts of a womans position in the worldthe meagre realities of such freedom as it permitted her the almost unavoidable obligation to some individual man under which she must labor for even a foothold in the world
She had flung away from her fathers support with the finest assumption of personal independence
And here she wasin a mess because it had been impossible for her to avoid leaning upon another man
She had thoughtWhat had she thought
That this dependence of women was but an illusion which needed only to be denied to vanish
She had denied it with vigor and here she was
She did not so much exhaust this general question as pass from it to her insoluble individual problem again What am I to do
She wanted first of all to fling the forty pounds back into Ramages face
But she had spent nearly half of it and had no conception of how such a sum could be made good again
She thought of all sorts of odd and desperate expedients and with passionate petulance rejected them all
She took refuge in beating her pillow and inventing insulting epithets for herself
She got up drew up her blind and stared out of window at a dawncold vision of chimneys for a time and then went and sat on the edge of her bed
What was the alternative to going home
No alternative appeared in that darkness
It seemed intolerable that she should go home and admit herself beaten
She did most urgently desire to save her face in Morningside Park and for long hours she could think of no way of putting it that would not be in the nature of unconditional admission of defeat
Id rather go as a chorusgirl she said
She was not very clear about the position and duties of a chorusgirl but it certainly had the air of being a last desperate resort
There sprang from that a vague hope that perhaps she might extort a capitulation from her father by a threat to seek that position and then with overwhelming clearness it came to her that whatever happened she would never be able to tell her father about her debt
The completest capitulation would not wipe out that trouble
And she felt that if she went home it was imperative to pay
She would always be going to and fro up the Avenue getting glimpses of Ramage seeing him in trains



For a time she promenaded the room
Why did I ever take that loan
An idiot girl in an asylum would have known better than that
Vulgarity of soul and innocence of mindthe worst of all conceivable combinations
I wish some one would kill Ramage by accident



But then they would find that check endorsed in his bureau



I wonder what he will do
She tried to imagine situations that might arise out of Ramages antagonism for he had been so bitter and savage that she could not believe that he would leave things as they were
The next morning she went out with her postoffice savings bankbook and telegraphed for a warrant to draw out all the money she had in the world
It amounted to twoandtwenty pounds
She addressed an envelope to Ramage and scrawled on a halfsheet of paper The rest shall follow
The money would be available in the afternoon and she would send him four five pound notes
The rest she meant to keep for her immediate necessities
A little relieved by this step toward reinstatement she went on to the Imperial College to forget her muddle of problems for a time if she could in the presence of Capes
Part 7 For a time the biological laboratory was full of healing virtue
Her sleepless night had left her languid but not stupefied and for an hour or so the work distracted her altogether from her troubles
Then after Capes had been through her work and had gone on it came to her that the fabric of this life of hers was doomed to almost immediate collapse that in a little while these studies would cease and perhaps she would never set eyes on him again
After that consolations fled
The overnight nervous strain began to tell she became inattentive to the work before her and it did not get on
She felt sleepy and unusually irritable
She lunched at a creamery in Great Portland Street and as the day was full of wintry sunshine spent the rest of the lunchhour in a drowsy gloom which she imagined to be thought upon the problems of her position on a seat in Regents Park
A girl of fifteen or sixteen gave her a handbill that she regarded as a tract until she saw Votes for Women at the top
That turned her mind to the more generalized aspects of her perplexities again
She had never been so disposed to agree that the position of women in the modern world is intolerable
Capes joined the students at tea and displayed himself in an impish mood that sometimes possessed him
He did not notice that Ann Veronica was preoccupied and heavyeyed
Miss Klegg raised the question of womens suffrage and he set himself to provoke a duel between her and Miss Garvice
The youth with the hair brushed back and the spectacled Scotchman joined in the fray for and against the womens vote
Ever and again Capes appealed to Ann Veronica
He liked to draw her in and she did her best to talk
But she did not talk readily and in order to say something she plunged a little and felt she plunged
Capes scored back with an uncompromising vigor that was his way of complimenting her intelligence
But this afternoon it discovered an unusual vein of irritability in her
He had been reading Belfort Bax and declared himself a convert
He contrasted the lot of women in general with the lot of men presented men as patient selfimmolating martyrs and women as the pampered favorites of Nature
A vein of conviction mingled with his burlesque
For a time he and Miss Klegg contradicted one another
The question ceased to be a teatable talk and became suddenly tragically real for Ann Veronica
There he sat cheerfully friendly in his sexs freedomthe man she loved the one man she cared should unlock the way to the wide world for her imprisoned feminine possibilities and he seemed regardless that she stifled under his eyes he made a jest of all this passionate insurgence of the souls of women against the fate of their conditions
Miss Garvice repeated again and almost in the same words she used at every discussion her contribution to the great question
She thought that women were not made for the struggle and turmoil of lifetheir place was the little world the home that their power lay not in votes but in influence over men and in making the minds of their children fine and splendid
Women should understand mens affairs perhaps said Miss Garvice but to mingle in them is just to sacrifice that power of influencing they can exercise now
There IS something sound in that position said Capes intervening as if to defend Miss Garvice against a possible attack from Ann Veronica
It may not be just and so forth but after all it is how things are
Women are not in the world in the same sense that men arefighting individuals in a scramble
I dont see how they can be
Every home is a little recess a niche out of the world of business and competition in which women and the future shelter
A little pit
said Ann Veronica a little prison
Its just as often a little refuge
Anyhow that is how things are
And the man stands as the master at the mouth of the den
As sentinel
You forget all the mass of training and tradition and instinct that go to make him a tolerable master
Nature is a mother her sympathies have always been feminist and she has tempered the man to the shorn woman
I wish said Ann Veronica with sudden anger that you could know what it is to live in a pit
She stood up as she spoke and put down her cup beside Miss Garvices
She addressed Capes as though she spoke to him alone
I cant endure it she said
Every one turned to her in astonishment
She felt she had to go on
No man can realize she said what that pit can be
The waythe way we are led on
We are taught to believe we are free in the world to think we are queens



Then we find out
We find out no man will treat a woman fairly as man to manno man
He wants youor he doesnt and then he helps some other woman against you



What you say is probably all true and necessary



But think of the disillusionment
Except for our sex we have minds like men desires like men
We come out into the world some of us She paused
Her words as she said them seemed to her to mean nothing and there was so much that struggled for expression
Women are mocked she said
Whenever they try to take hold of life a man intervenes
She felt with a sudden horror that she might weep
She wished she had not stood up
She wondered wildly why she had stood up
No one spoke and she was impelled to flounder on
Think of the mockery
she said
Think how dumb we find ourselves and stifled
I know we seem to have a sort of freedom



Have you ever tried to run and jump in petticoats Mr Capes
Well think what it must be to live in themsoul and mind and body
Its fun for a man to jest at our position
I wasnt jesting said Capes abruptly
She stood face to face with him and his voice cut across her speech and made her stop abruptly
She was sore and overstrung and it was intolerable to her that he should stand within three yards of her unsuspectingly with an incalculably vast power over her happiness
She was sore with the perplexities of her preposterous position
She was sick of herself of her life of everything but him and for him all her masked and hidden being was crying out
She stopped abruptly at the sound of his voice and lost the thread of what she was saying
In the pause she realized the attention of the others converged upon her and that the tears were brimming over her eyes
She felt a storm of emotion surging up within her
She became aware of the Scotch student regarding her with stupendous amazement a teacup poised in one hairy hand and his faceted glasses showing a various enlargement of segments of his eye
The door into the passage offered itself with an irresistible invitationthe one alternative to a public inexplicable passion of weeping
Capes flashed to an understanding of her intention sprang to his feet and opened the door for her retreat
Part 8 Why should I ever come back
she said to herself as she went down the staircase
She went to the postoffice and drew out and sent off her money to Ramage
And then she came out into the street sure only of one thingthat she could not return directly to her lodgings
She wanted airand the distraction of having moving and changing things about her
The evenings were beginning to draw out and it would not be dark for an hour
She resolved to walk across the Park to the Zoological gardens and so on by way of Primrose Hill to Hampstead Heath
There she would wander about in the kindly darkness
And think things out



Presently she became aware of footsteps hurrying after her and glanced back to find Miss Klegg a little out of breath in pursuit
Ann Veronica halted a pace and Miss Klegg came alongside
Do YOU go across the Park
Not usually
But Im going today
I want a walk
Im not surprised at it
I thought Mr Capes most trying
Oh it wasnt that
Ive had a headache all day
I thought Mr Capes most unfair Miss Klegg went on in a small even voice MOST unfair
Im glad you spoke out as you did
I didnt mind that little argument
You gave it him well
What you said wanted saying
After you went he got up and took refuge in the preparationroom
Or else I would have finished him
Ann Veronica said nothing and Miss Klegg went on He very often ISmost unfair
He has a way of sitting on people
He wouldnt like it if people did it to him
He jumps the words out of your mouth he takes hold of what you have to say before you have had time to express it properly
Pause
I suppose hes frightfully clever said Miss Klegg
Hes a Fellow of the Royal Society and he cant be much over thirty said Miss Klegg
He writes very well said Ann Veronica
He cant be more than thirty
He must have married when he was quite a young man
Married
said Ann Veronica
Didnt you know he was married
asked Miss Klegg and was struck by a thought that made her glance quickly at her companion
Ann Veronica had no answer for a moment
She turned her head away sharply
Some automaton within her produced in a quite unfamiliar voice the remark Theyre playing football
Its too far for the ball to reach us said Miss Klegg
I didnt know Mr Capes was married said Ann Veronica resuming the conversation with an entire disappearance of her former lassitude
Oh yes said Miss Klegg I thought every one knew
No said Ann Veronica offhandedly
Never heard anything of it
I thought every one knew
I thought every one had heard about it
But why
Hes marriedand I believe living separated from his wife
There was a case or something some years ago
What case
A divorceor somethingI dont know
But I have heard that he almost had to leave the schools
If it hadnt been for Professor Russell standing up for him they say he would have had to leave
Was he divorced do you mean
No but he got himself mixed up in a divorce case
I forget the particulars but I know it was something very disagreeable
It was among artistic people
Ann Veronica was silent for a while
I thought every one had heard said Miss Klegg
Or I wouldnt have said anything about it
I suppose all men said Ann Veronica in a tone of detached criticism get some such entanglement
And anyhow it doesnt matter to us
She turned abruptly at right angles to the path they followed
This is my way back to my side of the Park she said
I thought you were coming right across the Park
Oh no said Ann Veronica I have some work to do
I just wanted a breath of air
And theyll shut the gates presently
Its not far from twilight
Part 9 She was sitting brooding over her fire about ten oclock that night when a sealed and registered envelope was brought up to her
She opened it and drew out a letter and folded within it were the notes she had sent off to Ramage that day
The letter began MY DEAREST GIRLI cannot let you do this foolish thing She crumpled notes and letter together in her hand and then with a passionate gesture flung them into the fire
Instantly she seized the poker and made a desperate effort to get them out again
But she was only able to save a corner of the letter
The twenty pounds burned with avidity
She remained for some seconds crouching at the fender poker in hand
By Jove
she said standing up at last that about finishes it Ann Veronica
CHAPTER THE TENTH THE SUFFRAGETTES Part 1 There is only one way out of all this said Ann Veronica sitting up in her little bed in the darkness and biting at her nails
I thought I was just up against Morningside Park and father but its the whole order of thingsthe whole blessed order of things



She shivered
She frowned and gripped her hands about her knees very tightly
Her mind developed into savage wrath at the present conditions of a womans life
I suppose all life is an affair of chances
But a womans life is all chance
Its artificially chance
Find your man thats the rule
All the rest is humbug and delicacy
Hes the handle of life for you
He will let you live if it pleases him



Cant it be altered
I suppose an actress is free



She tried to think of some altered state of affairs in which these monstrous limitations would be alleviated in which women would stand on their own feet in equal citizenship with men
For a time she brooded on the ideals and suggestions of the Socialists on the vague intimations of an Endowment of Motherhood of a complete relaxation of that intense individual dependence for women which is woven into the existing social order
At the back of her mind there seemed always one irrelevant qualifying spectator whose presence she sought to disregard
She would not look at him would not think of him when her mind wavered then she muttered to herself in the darkness so as to keep hold of her generalizations
It is true
It is no good waiving the thing it is true
Unless women are never to be free never to be even respected there must be a generation of martyrs



Why shouldnt we be martyrs
Theres nothing else for most of us anyhow
Its a sort of blacklegging to want to have a life of ones own



She repeated as if she answered an objector A sort of blacklegging
A sex of blacklegging clients
Her mind diverged to other aspects and another type of womanhood
Poor little Miniver
What can she be but what she is



Because she states her case in a tangle drags it through swamps of nonsense it doesnt alter the fact that she is right
That phrase about dragging the truth through swamps of nonsense she remembered from Capes
At the recollection that it was his she seemed to fall through a thin surface as one might fall through the crust of a lava into glowing depths
She wallowed for a time in the thought of Capes unable to escape from his image and the idea of his presence in her life
She let her mind run into dreams of that cloud paradise of an altered world in which the Goopes and Minivers the Fabians and reforming people believed
Across that world was written in letters of light Endowment of Motherhood
Suppose in some complex yet conceivable way women were endowed were no longer economically and socially dependent on men
If one was free she said one could go to him



This vile hovering to catch a mans eye



One could go to him and tell him one loved him
I want to love him
A little love from him would be enough
It would hurt no one
It would not burden him with any obligation
She groaned aloud and bowed her forehead to her knees
She floundered deep
She wanted to kiss his feet
His feet would have the firm texture of his hands
Then suddenly her spirit rose in revolt
I will not have this slavery she said
I will not have this slavery
She shook her fist ceilingward
Do you hear
she said whatever you are wherever you are
I will not be slave to the thought of any man slave to the customs of any time
Confound this slavery of sex
I am a man
I will get this under if I am killed in doing it
She scowled into the cold blacknesses about her
Manning she said and contemplated a figure of inaggressive persistence
No
Her thoughts had turned in a new direction
It doesnt matter she said after a long interval if they are absurd
They mean something
They mean everything that women can meanexcept submission
The vote is only the beginning the necessary beginning
If we do not begin She had come to a resolution
Abruptly she got out of bed smoothed her sheet and straightened her pillow and lay down and fell almost instantly asleep
Part 2 The next morning was as dark and foggy as if it was midNovember instead of early March
Ann Veronica woke rather later than usual and lay awake for some minutes before she remembered a certain resolution she had taken in the small hours
Then instantly she got out of bed and proceeded to dress
She did not start for the Imperial College
She spent the morning up to ten in writing a series of unsuccessful letters to Ramage which she tore up unfinished and finally she desisted and put on her jacket and went out into the lamplit obscurity and slimy streets
She turned a resolute face southward
She followed Oxford Street into Holborn and then she inquired for Chancery Lane
There she sought and at last found 107A one of those heterogeneous piles of offices which occupy the eastern side of the lane
She studied the painted names of firms and persons and enterprises on the wall and discovered that the Womens Bond of Freedom occupied several contiguous suites on the first floor
She went upstairs and hesitated between four doors with groundglass panes each of which professed The Womens Bond of Freedom in neat black letters
She opened one and found herself in a large untidy room set with chairs that were a little disarranged as if by an overnight meeting
On the walls were noticeboards bearing clusters of newspaper slips three or four big posters of monster meetings one of which Ann Veronica had attended with Miss Miniver and a series of announcements in purple copyingink and in one corner was a pile of banners
There was no one at all in this room but through the halfopen door of one of the small apartments that gave upon it she had a glimpse of two very young girls sitting at a littered table and writing briskly
She walked across to this apartment and opening the door a little wider discovered a press section of the movement at work
I want to inquire said Ann Veronica
Next door said a spectacled young person of seventeen or eighteen with an impatient indication of the direction
In the adjacent apartment Ann Veronica found a middleaged woman with a tired face under the tired hat she wore sitting at a desk opening letters while a dusky untidy girl of eightor nineandtwenty hammered industriously at a typewriter
The tired woman looked up in inquiring silence at Ann Veronicas diffident entry
I want to know more about this movement said Ann Veronica
Are you with us
said the tired woman
I dont know said Ann Veronica I think I am
I want very much to do something for women
But I want to know what you are doing
The tired woman sat still for a moment
You havent come here to make a lot of difficulties
she asked
No said Ann Veronica but I want to know
The tired woman shut her eyes tightly for a moment and then looked with them at Ann Veronica
What can you do
she asked
Do
Are you prepared to do things for us
Distribute bills
Write letters
Interrupt meetings
Canvass at elections
Face dangers
If I am satisfied If we satisfy you
Then if possible I would like to go to prison
It isnt nice going to prison
It would suit me
It isnt nice getting there
Thats a question of detail said Ann Veronica
The tired woman looked quietly at her
What are your objections
she said
It isnt objections exactly
I want to know what you are doing how you think this work of yours really does serve women
We are working for the equal citizenship of men and women said the tired woman
Women have been and are treated as the inferiors of men we want to make them their equals
Yes said Ann Veronica I agree to that
But The tired woman raised her eyebrows in mild protest
Isnt the question more complicated than that
said Ann Veronica
You could have a talk to Miss Kitty Brett this afternoon if you liked
Shall I make an appointment for you
Miss Kitty Brett was one of the most conspicuous leaders of the movement
Ann Veronica snatched at the opportunity and spent most of the intervening time in the Assyrian Court of the British Museum reading and thinking over a little book upon the feminist movement the tired woman had made her buy
She got a bun and some cocoa in the little refreshmentroom and then wandered through the galleries upstairs crowded with Polynesian idols and Polynesian dancinggarments and all the simple immodest accessories to life in Polynesia to a seat among the mummies
She was trying to bring her problems to a head and her mind insisted upon being even more discursive and atmospheric than usual
It generalized everything she put to it
Why should women be dependent on men
she asked and the question was at once converted into a system of variations upon the theme of Why are things as they are
Why are human beings viviparous
Why are people hungry thrice a day
Why does one faint at danger
She stood for a time looking at the dry limbs and still human face of that desiccated unwrapped mummy from the very beginnings of social life
It looked very patient she thought and a little selfsatisfied
It looked as if it had taken its world for granted and prospered on that assumptiona world in which children were trained to obey their elders and the wills of women overruled as a matter of course
It was wonderful to think this thing had lived had felt and suffered
Perhaps once it had desired some other human being intolerably
Perhaps some one had kissed the brow that was now so cadaverous rubbed that sunken cheek with loving fingers held that stringy neck with passionately living hands
But all of that was forgotten
In the end it seemed to be thinking they embalmed me with the utmost respectsound spices chosen to endurethe best
I took my world as I found it
THINGS ARE SO
Part 3 Ann Veronicas first impression of Kitty Brett was that she was aggressive and disagreeable her next that she was a person of amazing persuasive power
She was perhaps threeandtwenty and very pink and healthylooking showing a great deal of white and rounded neck above her businesslike but altogether feminine blouse and a good deal of plump gesticulating forearm out of her short sleeve
She had animated dark bluegray eyes under her fine eyebrows and dark brown hair that rolled back simply and effectively from her broad low forehead
And she was about as capable of intelligent argument as a runaway steamroller
She was a trained beingtrained by an implacable mother to one end
She spoke with fluent enthusiasm
She did not so much deal with Ann Veronicas interpolations as dispose of them with quick and usehardened repartee and then she went on with a fine directness to sketch the case for her agitation for that remarkable rebellion of the women that was then agitating the whole world of politics and discussion
She assumed with a kind of mesmeric force all the propositions that Ann Veronica wanted her to define
What do we want
What is the goal
asked Ann Veronica
Freedom
Citizenship
And the way to thatthe way to everythingis the Vote
Ann Veronica said something about a general change of ideas
How can you change peoples ideas if you have no power
said Kitty Brett
Ann Veronica was not ready enough to deal with that counterstroke 
One doesnt want to turn the whole thing into a mere sex antagonism
When women get justice said Kitty Brett there will be no sex antagonism
None at all
Until then we mean to keep on hammering away
It seems to me that much of a womans difficulties are economic
That will follow said Kitty Brettthat will follow
She interrupted as Ann Veronica was about to speak again with a bright contagious hopefulness
Everything will follow she said
Yes said Ann Veronica trying to think where they were trying to get things plain again that had seemed plain enough in the quiet of the night
Nothing was ever done Miss Brett asserted without a certain element of Faith
After we have got the Vote and are recognized as citizens then we can come to all these other things
Even in the glamour of Miss Bretts assurance it seemed to Ann Veronica that this was after all no more than the gospel of Miss Miniver with a new set of resonances
And like that gospel it meant something something different from its phrases something elusive and yet something that in spite of the superficial incoherence of its phrasing was largely essentially true
There was something holding women down holding women back and if it wasnt exactly manmade law manmade law was an aspect of it
There was something indeed holding the whole species back from the imaginable largeness of life



The Vote is the symbol of everything said Miss Brett
She made an abrupt personal appeal
Oh
please dont lose yourself in a wilderness of secondary considerations she said
Dont ask me to tell you all that women can do all that women can be
There is a new life different from the old life of dependence possible
If only we are not divided
If only we work together
This is the one movement that brings women of different classes together for a common purpose
If you could see how it gives them souls women who have taken things for granted who have given themselves up altogether to pettiness and vanity



Give me something to do said Ann Veronica interrupting her persuasions at last
It has been very kind of you to see me but I dont want to sit and talk and use your time any longer
I want to do something
I want to hammer myself against all this that pens women in
I feel that I shall stifle unless I can do somethingand do something soon
Part 4 It was not Ann Veronicas fault that the nights work should have taken upon itself the forms of wild burlesque
She was in deadly earnest in everything she did
It seemed to her the last desperate attack upon the universe that would not let her live as she desired to live that penned her in and controlled her and directed her and disapproved of her the same invincible wrappering the same leaden tyranny of a universe that she had vowed to overcome after that memorable conflict with her father at Morningside Park
She was listed for the raidshe was informed it was to be a raid upon the House of Commons though no particulars were given herand told to go alone to 14 Dexter Street Westminster and not to ask any policeman to direct her
14 Dexter Street Westminster she found was not a house but a yard in an obscure street with big gates and the name of Podgers  Carlo Carriers and Furniture Removers thereon
She was perplexed by this and stood for some seconds in the empty street hesitating until the appearance of another circumspect woman under the street lamp at the corner reassured her
In one of the big gates was a little door and she rapped at this
It was immediately opened by a man with light eyelashes and a manner suggestive of restrained passion
Come right in he hissed under his breath with the true conspirators note closed the door very softly and pointed Through there
By the meagre light of a gas lamp she perceived a cobbled yard with four large furniture vans standing with horses and lamps alight
A slender young man wearing glasses appeared from the shadow of the nearest van
Are you A B C or D
he asked
They told me D said Ann Veronica
Through there he said and pointed with the pamphlet he was carrying
Ann Veronica found herself in a little stirring crowd of excited women whispering and tittering and speaking in undertones
The light was poor so that she saw their gleaming faces dimly and indistinctly
No one spoke to her
She stood among them watching them and feeling curiously alien to them
The oblique ruddy lighting distorted them oddly made queer bars and patches of shadow upon their clothes
Its Kittys idea said one we are to go in the vans
Kitty is wonderful said another
Wonderful
I have always longed for prison service said a voice always
From the beginning
But its only now Im able to do it
A little blond creature close at hand suddenly gave way to a fit of hysterical laughter and caught up the end of it with a sob
Before I took up the Suffrage a firm flat voice remarked I could scarcely walk upstairs without palpitations
Some one hidden from Ann Veronica appeared to be marshalling the assembly
We have to get in I think said a nice little old lady in a bonnet to Ann Veronica speaking with a voice that quavered a little
My dear can you see in this light
I think I would like to get in
Which is C
Ann Veronica with a curious sinking of the heart regarded the black cavities of the vans
Their doors stood open and placards with big letters indicated the section assigned to each
She directed the little old woman and then made her way to van D A young woman with a white badge on her arm stood and counted the sections as they entered their vans
When they tap the roof she said in a voice of authority you are to come out
You will be opposite the big entrance in Old Palace Yard
Its the public entrance
You are to make for that and get into the lobby if you can and so try and reach the floor of the House crying Votes for Women
as you go
She spoke like a mistress addressing schoolchildren
Dont bunch too much as you come out she added
All right
asked the man with the light eyelashes suddenly appearing in the doorway
He waited for an instant wasting an encouraging smile in the imperfect light and then shut the doors of the van leaving the women in darkness



The van started with a jerk and rumbled on its way
Its like Troy
said a voice of rapture
Its exactly like Troy
Part 5 So Ann Veronica enterprising and a little dubious as ever mingled with the stream of history and wrote her Christian name upon the policecourt records of the land
But out of a belated regard for her father she wrote the surname of some one else
Some day when the rewards of literature permit the arduous research required the Campaign of the Women will find its Carlyle and the particulars of that marvellous series of exploits by which Miss Brett and her colleagues nagged the whole Western world into the discussion of womens position become the material for the most delightful and amazing descriptions
At present the world waits for that writer and the confused record of the newspapers remains the only resource of the curious
When he comes he will do that raid of the pantechnicons the justice it deserves he will picture the orderly evening scene about the Imperial Legislature in convincing detail the coming and going of cabs and motorcabs and broughams through the chill damp evening into New Palace Yard the reinforced but untroubled and unsuspecting police about the entries of those great buildings whose square and panelled Victorian Gothic streams up from the glare of the lamps into the murkiness of the night Big Ben shining overhead an unassailable beacon and the incidental traffic of Westminster cabs carts and glowing omnibuses going to and from the bridge
About the Abbey and Abingdon Street stood the outer pickets and detachments of the police their attention all directed westward to where the women in Caxton Hall Westminster hummed like an angry hive
Squads reached to the very portal of that centre of disturbance
And through all these defences and into Old Palace Yard into the very vitals of the defenders position lumbered the unsuspected vans
They travelled past the few idle sightseers who had braved the uninviting evening to see what the Suffragettes might be doing they pulled up unchallenged within thirty yards of those coveted portals
And then they disgorged
Were I a painter of subject pictures I would exhaust all my skill in proportion and perspective and atmosphere upon the august seat of empire I would present it gray and dignified and immense and respectable beyond any mere verbal description and then in vivid black and very small I would put in those valiantly impertinent vans squatting at the base of its altitudes and pouring out a swift straggling rush of ominous little black objects minute figures of determined women at war with the universe
Ann Veronica was in their very forefront
In an instant the expectant calm of Westminster was ended and the very Speaker in the chair blenched at the sound of the policemens whistles
The bolder members in the House left their places to go lobbyward grinning
Others pulled hats over their noses cowered in their seats and feigned that all was right with the world
In Old Palace Yard everybody ran
They either ran to see or ran for shelter
Even two Cabinet Ministers took to their heels grinning insincerely
At the opening of the van doors and the emergence into the fresh air Ann Veronicas doubt and depression gave place to the wildest exhilaration
That same adventurousness that had already buoyed her through crises that would have overwhelmed any normally feminine girl with shame and horror now became uppermost again
Before her was a great Gothic portal
Through that she had to go
Past her shot the little old lady in the bonnet running incredibly fast but otherwise still alertly respectable and she was making a strange threatening sound as she ran such as one would use in driving ducks out of a gardenBrrrrr
and pawing with blackgloved hands
The policemen were closing in from the sides to intervene
The little old lady struck like a projectile upon the resounding chest of the foremost of these and then Ann Veronica had got past and was ascending the steps
Then most horribly she was clasped about the waist from behind and lifted from the ground
At that a new element poured into her excitement an element of wild disgust and terror
She had never experienced anything so disagreeable in her life as the sense of being held helplessly off her feet
She screamed involuntarilyshe had never in her life screamed before and then she began to wriggle and fight like a frightened animal against the men who were holding her
The affair passed at one leap from a spree to a nightmare of violence and disgust
Her hair got loose her hat came over one eye and she had no arm free to replace it
She felt she must suffocate if these men did not put her down and for a time they would not put her down
Then with an indescribable relief her feet were on the pavement and she was being urged along by two policemen who were gripping her wrists in an irresistible expert manner
She was writhing to get her hands loose and found herself gasping with passionate violence Its damnabledamnable
to the manifest disgust of the fatherly policeman on her right
Then they had released her arms and were trying to push her away
You be off missie said the fatherly policeman
This aint no place for you
He pushed her a dozen yards along the greasy pavement with flat welltrained hands that there seemed to be no opposing
Before her stretched blank spaces dotted with running people coming toward her and below them railings and a statue
She almost submitted to this ending of her adventure
But at the word home she turned again
I wont go home she said I wont
and she evaded the clutch of the fatherly policeman and tried to thrust herself past him in the direction of that big portal
Steady on
he cried
A diversion was created by the violent struggles of the little old lady
She seemed to be endowed with superhuman strength
A knot of three policemen in conflict with her staggered toward Ann Veronicas attendants and distracted their attention
I WILL be arrested
I WONT go home
the little old lady was screaming over and over again
They put her down and she leaped at them she smote a helmet to the ground
Youll have to take her
shouted an inspector on horseback and she echoed his cry Youll have to take me
They seized upon her and lifted her and she screamed
Ann Veronica became violently excited at the sight
You cowards
said Ann Veronica put her down
and tore herself from a detaining hand and battered with her fists upon the big red ear and blue shoulder of the policeman who held the little old lady
So Ann Veronica also was arrested
And then came the vile experience of being forced and borne along the street to the policestation
Whatever anticipation Ann Veronica had formed of this vanished in the reality
Presently she was going through a swaying noisy crowd whose faces grinned and stared pitilessly in the light of the electric standards
Go it miss
cried one
Kick aht at em
though indeed she went now with Christian meekness resenting only the thrusting policemens hands
Several people in the crowd seemed to be fighting
Insulting cries became frequent and various but for the most part she could not understand what was said
Wholl mind the baby nar
was one of the nights inspirations and very frequent
A lean young man in spectacles pursued her for some time crying Courage
Courage
Somebody threw a dab of mud at her and some of it got down her neck
Immeasurable disgust possessed her
She felt draggled and insulted beyond redemption
She could not hide her face
She attempted by a sheer act of will to end the scene to will herself out of it anywhere
She had a horrible glimpse of the once nice little old lady being also borne stationward still faintly battling and very muddyone lock of grayish hair straggling over her neck her face scared white but triumphant
Her bonnet dropped off and was trampled into the gutter
A little Cockney recovered it and made ridiculous attempts to get to her and replace it
You must arrest me
she gasped breathlessly insisting insanely on a point already carried you shall
The policestation at the end seemed to Ann Veronica like a refuge from unnamable disgraces
She hesitated about her name and being prompted gave it at last as Ann Veronica Smith 107A Chancery Lane



Indignation carried her through that night that men and the world could so entreat her
The arrested women were herded in a passage of the Panton Street Policestation that opened upon a cell too unclean for occupation and most of them spent the night standing
Hot coffee and cakes were sent in to them in the morning by some intelligent sympathizer or she would have starved all day
Submission to the inevitable carried her through the circumstances of her appearance before the magistrate
He was no doubt doing his best to express the attitude of society toward these wearily heroic defendants but he seemed to be merely rude and unfair to Ann Veronica
He was not it seemed the proper stipendiary at all and there had been some demur to his jurisdiction that had ruffled him
He resented being regarded as irregular
He felt he was human wisdom prudentially interpolated



You silly wimmin he said over and over again throughout the hearing plucking at his blottingpad with busy hands
You silly creatures
Ugh
Fie upon you
The court was crowded with people for the most part supporters and admirers of the defendants and the man with the light eyelashes was conspicuously active and omnipresent
Ann Veronicas appearance was brief and undistinguished
She had nothing to say for herself
She was guided into the dock and prompted by a helpful police inspector
She was aware of the body of the court of clerks seated at a black table littered with papers of policemen standing about stiffly with expressions of conscious integrity and a murmuring background of the heads and shoulders of spectators close behind her
On a high chair behind a raised counter the stipendiarys substitute regarded her malevolently over his glasses
A disagreeable young man with red hair and a loose mouth seated at the reporters table was only too manifestly sketching her
She was interested by the swearing of the witnesses
The kissing of the book struck her as particularly odd and then the policemen gave their evidence in staccato jerks and stereotyped phrases
Have you anything to ask the witness
asked the helpful inspector
The ribald demons that infested the back of Ann Veronicas mind urged various facetious interrogations upon her as for example where the witness had acquired his prose style
She controlled herself and answered meekly No
Well Ann Veronica Smith the magistrate remarked when the case was all before him youre a goodlooking strong respectable gell and its a pity you silly young wimmin cant find something better to do with your exuberance
Twoandtwenty
I cant imagine what your parents can be thinking about to let you get into these scrapes
Ann Veronicas mind was filled with confused unutterable replies
You are persuaded to come and take part in these outrageous proceedingsmany of you I am convinced have no idea whatever of their nature
I dont suppose you could tell me even the derivation of suffrage if I asked you
No
not even the derivation
But the fashions been set and in it you must be
The men at the reporters table lifted their eyebrows smiled faintly and leaned back to watch how she took her scolding
One with the appearance of a bald little gnome yawned agonizingly
They had got all this down alreadythey heard the substance of it now for the fourteenth time
The stipendiary would have done it all very differently
She found presently she was out of the dock and confronted with the alternative of being bound over in one surety for the sum of forty poundswhatever that might mean or a months imprisonment
Second class said some one but first and second were all alike to her
She elected to go to prison
At last after a long rumbling journey in a stuffy windowless van she reached Canongate Prisonfor Holloway had its quota already
It was bad luck to go to Canongate
Prison was beastly
Prison was bleak without spaciousness and pervaded by a faint oppressive smell and she had to wait two hours in the sullenly defiant company of two unclean women thieves before a cell could be assigned to her
Its dreariness like the filthiness of the police cell was a discovery for her
She had imagined that prisons were whitetiled places reeking of limewash and immaculately sanitary
Instead they appeared to be at the hygienic level of tramps lodginghouses
She was bathed in turbid water that had already been used
She was not allowed to bathe herself another prisoner with a privileged manner washed her
Conscientious objectors to that process are not permitted she found in Canongate
Her hair was washed for her also
Then they dressed her in a dirty dress of coarse serge and a cap and took away her own clothes
The dress came to her only too manifestly unwashed from its former wearer even the underlinen they gave her seemed unclean
Horrible memories of things seen beneath the microscope of the baser forms of life crawled across her mind and set her shuddering with imagined irritations
She sat on the edge of the bedthe wardress was too busy with the flood of arrivals that day to discover that she had it downand her skin was shivering from the contact of these garments
She surveyed accommodation that seemed at first merely austere and became more and more manifestly inadequate as the moments fled by
She meditated profoundly through several enormous cold hours on all that had happened and all that she had done since the swirl of the suffrage movement had submerged her personal affairs



Very slowly emerging out of a phase of stupefaction these personal affairs and her personal problem resumed possession of her mind
She had imagined she had drowned them altogether
CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH THOUGHTS IN PRISON Part 1 The first night in prison she found it impossible to sleep
The bed was hard beyond any experience of hers the bedclothes coarse and insufficient the cell at once cold and stuffy
The little grating in the door the sense of constant inspection worried her
She kept opening her eyes and looking at it
She was fatigued physically and mentally and neither mind nor body could rest
She became aware that at regular intervals a light flashed upon her face and a bodiless eye regarded her and this as the night wore on became a torment



Capes came back into her mind
He haunted a state between hectic dreaming and mild delirium and she found herself talking aloud to him
All through the night an entirely impossible and monumental Capes confronted her and she argued with him about men and women
She visualized him as in a policemans uniform and quite impassive
On some insane score she fancied she had to state her case in verse
We are the music and you are the instrument she said we are verse and you are prose
For men have reason women rhyme A man scores always all the time
This couplet sprang into her mind from nowhere and immediately begot an endless series of similar couplets that she began to compose and address to Capes
They came teeming distressfully through her aching brain A man can kick his skirts dont tear A man scores always everywhere
His dress for no man lays a snare A man scores always everywhere
For hats that fail and hats that flare Toppers their universal wear A man scores always everywhere
Mens waists are neither here nor there A man scores always everywhere
A man can manage without hair A man scores always everywhere
There are no males at men to stare A man scores always everywhere
And children must we women bear Oh damn
she cried as the hundredandfirst couplet or so presented itself in her unwilling brain
For a time she worried about that compulsory bath and cutaneous diseases
Then she fell into a fever of remorse for the habit of bad language she had acquired
A man can smoke a man can swear A man scores always everywhere
She rolled over on her face and stuffed her fingers in her ears to shut out the rhythm from her mind
She lay still for a long time and her mind resumed at a more tolerable pace
She found herself talking to Capes in an undertone of rational admission
There is something to be said for the ladylike theory after all she admitted
Women ought to be gentle and submissive persons strong only in virtue and in resistance to evil compulsion
My dearI can call you that here anyhowI know that
The Victorians overdid it a little I admit
Their idea of maidenly innocence was just a blank whitethe sort of flat white that doesnt shine
But that doesnt alter the fact that there IS innocence
And Ive read and thought and guessed and lookeduntil MY innocenceits smirched
Smirched



You see dear one IS passionately anxious for somethingwhat is it
One wants to be CLEAN
You want me to be clean
You would want me to be clean if you gave me a thought that is



I wonder if you give me a thought



Im not a good woman
I dont mean Im not a good womanI mean that Im not a GOOD woman
My poor brain is so mixed dear I hardly know what I am saying
I mean Im not a good specimen of a woman
Ive got a streak of male
Things happen to women proper womenand all they have to do is to take them well
Theyve just got to keep white
But Im always trying to make things happen
And I get myself dirty 


Its all dirt that washes off dear but its dirt
The white unaggressive woman who corrects and nurses and serves and is worshipped and betrayedthe martyrqueen of men the white mother



You cant do that sort of thing unless you do it over religion and theres no religion in meof that sortworth a rap
Im not gentle
Certainly not a gentlewoman
Im not coarseno
But Ive got no purity of mindno real purity of mind
A good womans mind has angels with flaming swords at the portals to keep out fallen thoughts



I wonder if there are any good women really
I wish I didnt swear
I do swear
It began as a joke



It developed into a sort of secret and private bad manners
Its got to be at last like tobaccoash over all my sayings and doings


 
Go it missie they said kick aht
I swore at that policemanand disgusted him
Disgusted him
For men policemen never blush A man in all things scores so much 


Damn
Things are getting plainer
It must be the dawn creeping in
Now here hath been dawning another blue day Im just a poor woman please take it away
Oh sleep
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep
Part 2 Now said Ann Veronica after the halfhour of exercise and sitting on the uncomfortable wooden seat without a back that was her perch by day its no good staying here in a sort of maze
Ive got nothing to do for a month but think
I may as well think
I ought to be able to think things out
How shall I put the question
What am I
What have I got to do with myself



I wonder if many people HAVE thought things out
Are we all just seizing hold of phrases and obeying moods
It wasnt so with oldfashioned people they knew right from wrong they had a clearcut religious faith that seemed to explain everything and give a rule for everything
We havent
I havent anyhow
And its no good pretending there is one when there isnt



I suppose I believe in God



Never really thought about Himpeople dont



I suppose my creed is I believe rather indistinctly in God the Father Almighty substratum of the evolutionary process and in a vein of vague sentimentality that doesnt give a datum for anything at all in Jesus Christ His Son



Its no sort of good Ann Veronica pretending one does believe when one doesnt



And as for praying for faiththis sort of monologue is about as near as any one of my sort ever gets to prayer
Arent I askingasking plainly now



Weve all been mixing our ideas and weve got intellectual hot coppersevery blessed one of us



A confusion of motivesthats what I am



There is this absurd craving for Mr Capesthe Capes crave they would call it in America
Why do I want him so badly
Why do I want him and think about him and fail to get away from him
It isnt all of me
The first person you love Ann Veronica is yourselfget hold of that
The soul you have to save is Ann Veronicas soul



She knelt upon the floor of her cell and clasped her hands and remained for a long time in silence
Oh God
she said at last how I wish I had been taught to pray
Part 3 She had some idea of putting these subtle and difficult issues to the chaplain when she was warned of his advent
But she had not reckoned with the etiquette of Canongate
She got up as she had been told to do at his appearance and he amazed her by sitting down according to custom on her stool
He still wore his hat to show that the days of miracles and Christ being civil to sinners are over forever
She perceived that his countenance was only composed by a great effort his features severely compressed
He was ruffled and his ears were red no doubt from some adjacent controversy
He classified her as he seated himself
Another young woman I suppose he said who knows better than her Maker about her place in the world
Have you anything to ask me
Ann Veronica readjusted her mind hastily
Her back stiffened
She produced from the depths of her pride the ugly investigatory note of the modern district visitor
Are you a special sort of clergyman she said after a pause and looking down her nose at him or do you go to the Universities
Oh
he said profoundly
He panted for a moment with unuttered replies and then with a scornful gesture got up and left the cell
So that Ann Veronica was not able to get the expert advice she certainly needed upon her spiritual state
Part 4 After a day or so she thought more steadily
She found herself in a phase of violent reaction against the suffrage movement a phase greatly promoted by one of those unreasonable objections people of Ann Veronicas temperament take at timesto the girl in the next cell to her own
She was a large resilient girl with a foolish smile a still more foolish expression of earnestness and a throaty contralto voice
She was noisy and hilarious and enthusiastic and her hair was always abominably done
In the chapel she sang with an openlunged gusto that silenced Ann Veronica altogether and in the exercisingyard slouched round with carelessly dispersed feet
Ann Veronica decided that hoydenish ragger was the only phrase to express her
She was always breaking rules whispering asides intimating signals
She became at times an embodiment for Ann Veronica of all that made the suffrage movement defective and unsatisfying
She was always initiating petty breaches of discipline
Her greatest exploit was the howling before the midday meal
This was an imitation of the noises made by the carnivora at the Zoological Gardens at feedingtime the idea was taken up by prisoner after prisoner until the whole place was alive with barkings yappings roarings pelican chatterings and feline yowlings interspersed with shrieks of hysterical laughter
To many in that crowded solitude it came as an extraordinary relief
It was better even than the hymnsinging
But it annoyed Ann Veronica
Idiots
she said when she heard this pandemonium and with particular reference to this young lady with the throaty contralto next door
Intolerable idiots



It took some days for this phase to pass and it left some scars and something like a decision
Violence wont do it said Ann Veronica
Begin violence and the woman goes under



But all the rest of our case is right



Yes
As the long solitary days wore on Ann Veronica found a number of definite attitudes and conclusions in her mind
One of these was a classification of women into women who are and women who are not hostile to men
The real reason why I am out of place here she said is because I like men
I can talk with them
Ive never found them hostile
Ive got no feminine class feeling
I dont want any laws or freedoms to protect me from a man like Mr Capes
I know that in my heart I would take whatever he gave



A woman wants a proper alliance with a man a man who is better stuff than herself
She wants that and needs it more than anything else in the world
It may not be just it may not be fair but things are so
It isnt law nor custom nor masculine violence settled that
It is just how things happen to be
She wants to be freeshe wants to be legally and economically free so as not to be subject to the wrong man but only God who made the world can alter things to prevent her being slave to the right one
And if she cant have the right one
Weve developed such a quality of preference
She rubbed her knuckles into her forehead
Oh but life is difficult
she groaned
When you loosen the tangle in one place you tie a knot in another



Before there is any change any real change I shall be deaddeaddead and finishedtwo hundred years



Part 5 One afternoon while everything was still the wardress heard her cry out suddenly and alarmingly and with great and unmistakable passion Why in the name of goodness did I burn that twenty pounds
Part 6 She sat regarding her dinner
The meat was coarse and disagreeably served
I suppose some one makes a bit on the food she said



One has such ridiculous ideas of the wicked common people and the beautiful machinery of order that ropes them in
And here are these places full of contagion
Of course this is the real texture of life this is what we refined secure people forget
We think the whole thing is straight and noble at bottom and it isnt
We think if we just defy the friends we have and go out into the world everything will become easy and splendid
One doesnt realize that even the sort of civilization one has at Morningside Park is held together with difficulty
By policemen one mustnt shock
This isnt a world for an innocent girl to walk about in
Its a world of dirt and skin diseases and parasites
Its a world in which the law can be a stupid pig and the policestations dirty dens
One wants helpers and protectorsand clean water
Am I becoming reasonable or am I being tamed
Im simply discovering that life is manysided and complex and puzzling
I thought one had only to take it by the throat
It hasnt GOT a throat
Part 7 One day the idea of selfsacrifice came into her head and she made she thought some important moral discoveries
It came with an extreme effect of rediscovery a remarkable novelty
What have I been all this time
she asked herself and answered Just stark egotism crude assertion of Ann Veronica without a modest rag of religion or discipline or respect for authority to cover me
It seemed to her as though she had at last found the touchstone of conduct
She perceived she had never really thought of any one but herself in all her acts and plans
Even Capes had been for her merely an excitant to passionate lovea mere idol at whose feet one could enjoy imaginative wallowings
She had set out to get a beautiful life a free untrammelled life selfdevelopment without counting the cost either for herself or others
I have hurt my father she said I have hurt my aunt
I have hurt and snubbed poor Teddy
Ive made no one happy
I deserve pretty much what Ive got



If only because of the way one hurts others if one kicks loose and free one has to submit



Brokenin people
I suppose the world is just all egotistical children and brokenin people
Your little flag of pride must flutter down with the rest of them Ann Veronica



Compromiseand kindness
Compromise and kindness
Who are YOU that the world should lie down at your feet
Youve got to be a decent citizen Ann Veronica
Take your half loaf with the others
You mustnt go clawing after a man that doesnt belong to youthat isnt even interested in you
Thats one thing clear
Youve got to take the decent reasonable way
Youve got to adjust yourself to the people God has set about you
Every one else does
She thought more and more along that line
There was no reason why she shouldnt be Capes friend
He did like her anyhow he was always pleased to be with her
There was no reason why she shouldnt be his restrained and dignified friend
After all that was life
Nothing was given away and no one came so rich to the stall as to command all that it had to offer
Every one has to make a deal with the world
It would be very good to be Capes friend
She might be able to go on with biology possibly even work upon the same questions that he dealt with



Perhaps her granddaughter might marry his grandson



It grew clear to her that throughout all her wild raid for independence she had done nothing for anybody and many people had done things for her
She thought of her aunt and that purse that was dropped on the table and of many troublesome and illrequited kindnesses she thought of the help of the Widgetts of Teddys admiration she thought with a newborn charity of her father of Mannings conscientious unselfishness of Miss Minivers devotion
And for me it has been Pride and Pride and Pride
I am the prodigal daughter
I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him I suppose pride and selfassertion are sin
Sinned against heaven Yes I have sinned against heaven and before thee



Poor old daddy
I wonder if hell spend much on the fatted calf



The wrappered lifediscipline
One comes to that at last
I begin to understand Jane Austen and chintz covers and decency and refinement and all the rest of it
One puts gloves on ones greedy fingers
One learns to sit up 


And somehow or other she added after a long interval I must pay Mr Ramage back his forty pounds
CHAPTER THE TWELFTH ANN VERONICA PUTS THINGS IN ORDER Part 1 Ann Veronica made a strenuous attempt to carry out her good resolutions
She meditated long and carefully upon her letter to her father before she wrote it and gravely and deliberately again before she despatched it
MY DEAR FATHER she wroteI have been thinking hard about everything since I was sent to this prison
All these experiences have taught me a great deal about life and realities
I see that compromise is more necessary to life than I ignorantly supposed it to be and I have been trying to get Lord Morleys book on that subject but it does not appear to be available in the prison library and the chaplain seems to regard him as an undesirable writer
At this point she had perceived that she was drifting from her subject
I must read him when I come out
But I see very clearly that as things are a daughter is necessarily dependent on her father and bound while she is in that position to live harmoniously with his ideals
Bit starchy said Ann Veronica and altered the key abruptly
Her concluding paragraph was on the whole perhaps hardly starchy enough
Really daddy I am sorry for all I have done to put you out
May I come home and try to be a better daughter to you
ANN VERONICA
Part 2 Her aunt came to meet her outside Canongate and being a little confused between what was official and what was merely a rebellious slight upon our national justice found herself involved in a triumphal procession to the Vindicator Vegetarian Restaurant and was specifically and personally cheered by a small shabby crowd outside that rendezvous
They decided quite audibly Shes an Old Dear anyhow
Voting wouldnt do no arm to er
She was on the very verge of a vegetarian meal before she recovered her head again
Obeying some fine instinct she had come to the prison in a dark veil but she had pushed this up to kiss Ann Veronica and never drawn it down again
Eggs were procured for her and she sat out the subsequent emotions and eloquence with the dignity becoming an injured lady of good family
The quiet encounter and homecoming Ann Veronica and she had contemplated was entirely disorganized by this misadventure there were no adequate explanations and after they had settled things at Ann Veronicas lodgings they reached home in the early afternoon estranged and depressed with headaches and the trumpet voice of the indomitable Kitty Brett still ringing in their ears
Dreadful women my dear
said Miss Stanley
And some of them quite pretty and well dressed
No need to do such things
We must never let your father know we went
Why ever did you let me get into that wagonette
I thought we had to said Ann Veronica who had also been a little under the compulsion of the marshals of the occasion
It was very tiring
We will have some tea in the drawingroom as soon as ever we canand I will take my things off
I dont think I shall ever care for this bonnet again
Well have some buttered toast
Your poor cheeks are quite sunken and hollow



Part 3 When Ann Veronica found herself in her fathers study that evening it seemed to her for a moment as though all the events of the past six months had been a dream
The big gray spaces of London the shoplit greasy shining streets had become very remote the biological laboratory with its work and emotions the meetings and discussions the rides in hansoms with Ramage were like things in a book read and closed
The study seemed absolutely unaltered there was still the same lamp with a little chip out of the shade still the same gas fire still the same bundle of blue and white papers it seemed with the same pink tape about them at the elbow of the armchair still the same father
He sat in much the same attitude and she stood just as she had stood when he told her she could not go to the Fadden Dance
Both had dropped the rather elaborate politeness of the diningroom and in their faces an impartial observer would have discovered little lines of obstinate wilfulness in common a certain hardnesssharp indeed in the father and softly rounded in the daughter but hardness nevertheless that made every compromise a bargain and every charity a discount
And so you have been thinking
her father began quoting her letter and looking over his slanting glasses at her
Well my girl I wish you had thought about all these things before these bothers began
Ann Veronica perceived that she must not forget to remain eminently reasonable
One has to live and learn she remarked with a passable imitation of her fathers manner
So long as you learn said Mr Stanley
Their conversation hung
I suppose daddy youve no objection to my going on with my work at the Imperial College
she asked
If it will keep you busy he said with a faintly ironical smile
The fees are paid to the end of the session
He nodded twice with his eyes on the fire as though that was a formal statement
You may go on with that work he said so long as you keep in harmony with things at home
Im convinced that much of Russells investigations are on wrong lines unsound lines
Stillyou must learn for yourself
Youre of ageyoure of age
The works almost essential for the BSc
exam
Its scandalous but I suppose it is
Their agreement so far seemed remarkable and yet as a homecoming the thing was a little lacking in warmth
But Ann Veronica had still to get to her chief topic
They were silent for a time
Its a period of crude views and crude work said Mr Stanley
Still these Mendelian fellows seem likely to give Mr Russell trouble a good lot of trouble
Some of their specimenswonderfully selected wonderfully got up
Daddy said Ann Veronica these affairsbeing away from home hascost money
I thought you would find that out
As a matter of fact I happen to have got a little into debt
NEVER
Her heart sank at the change in his expression
Well lodgings and things
And I paid my fees at the College
Yes
But how could you getWho gave you credit
You see said Ann Veronica my landlady kept on my room while I was in Holloway and the fees for the College mounted up pretty considerably
She spoke rather quickly because she found her fathers question the most awkward she had ever had to answer in her life
Molly and you settled about the rooms
She said you HAD some money
I borrowed it said Ann Veronica in a casual tone with white despair in her heart
But who could have lent you money
I pawned my pearl necklace
I got three pounds and theres three on my watch
Six pounds
Hm
Got the tickets
Yes but thenyou said you borrowed
I did too said Ann Veronica
Who from
She met his eye for a second and her heart failed her
The truth was impossible indecent
If she mentioned Ramage he might have a fitanything might happen
She lied
The Widgetts she said
Tut tut
he said
Really Vee you seem to have advertised our relations pretty generally
Theythey knew of course
Because of the Dance
How much do you owe them
She knew forty pounds was a quite impossible sum for their neighbors
She knew too she must not hesitate
Eight pounds she plunged and added foolishly fifteen pounds will see me clear of everything
She muttered some unladylike comment upon herself under her breath and engaged in secret additions
Mr Stanley determined to improve the occasion
He seemed to deliberate
Well he said at last slowly Ill pay it
Ill pay it
But I do hope Vee I do hope this is the end of these adventures
I hope you have learned your lesson now and come to seecome to realize how things are
People nobody can do as they like in this world
Everywhere there are limitations
I know said Ann Veronica fifteen pounds
I have learned that
I meanI mean to do what I can
Fifteen pounds
Fifteen from forty is twentyfive
He hesitated
She could think of nothing more to say
Well she achieved at last
Here goes for the new life
Here goes for the new life he echoed and stood up
Father and daughter regarded each other warily each more than a little insecure with the other
He made a movement toward her and then recalled the circumstances of their last conversation in that study
She saw his purpose and his doubt hesitated also and then went to him took his coat lapels and kissed him on the cheek
Ah Vee he said thats better
and kissed her back rather clumsily
Were going to be sensible
She disengaged herself from him and went out of the room with a grave preoccupied expression
Fifteen pounds
And she wanted forty
Part 4 It was perhaps the natural consequence of a long and tiring and exciting day that Ann Veronica should pass a broken and distressful night a night in which the noble and selfsubduing resolutions of Canongate displayed themselves for the first time in an atmosphere of almost lurid dismay
Her fathers peculiar stiffness of soul presented itself now as something altogether left out of the calculations upon which her plans were based and in particular she had not anticipated the difficulty she would find in borrowing the forty pounds she needed for Ramage
That had taken her by surprise and her tired wits had failed her
She was to have fifteen pounds and no more
She knew that to expect more now was like anticipating a goldmine in the garden
The chance had gone
It became suddenly glaringly apparent to her that it was impossible to return fifteen pounds or any sum less than twenty pounds to Ramage absolutely impossible
She realized that with a pang of disgust and horror
Already she had sent him twenty pounds and never written to explain to him why it was she had not sent it back sharply directly he returned it
She ought to have written at once and told him exactly what had happened
Now if she sent fifteen pounds the suggestion that she had spent a fivepound note in the meanwhile would be irresistible
No
That was impossible
She would have just to keep the fifteen pounds until she could make it twenty
That might happen on her birthdayin August
She turned about and was persecuted by visions half memories half dreams of Ramage
He became ugly and monstrous dunning her threatening her assailing her
Confound sex from first to last
said Ann Veronica
Why cant we propagate by sexless spores as the ferns do
We restrict each other we badger each other friendship is poisoned and buried under it



I MUST pay off that forty pounds
I MUST
For a time there seemed no comfort for her even in Capes
She was to see Capes tomorrow but now in this state of misery she had achieved she felt assured he would turn his back upon her take no notice of her at all
And if he didnt what was the good of seeing him
I wish he was a woman she said then I could make him my friend
I want him as my friend
I want to talk to him and go about with him
Just go about with him
She was silent for a time with her nose on the pillow and that brought her to Whats the good of pretending
I love him she said aloud to the dim forms of her room and repeated it and went on to imagine herself doing acts of tragically doglike devotion to the biologist who for the purposes of the drama remained entirely unconscious of and indifferent to her proceedings
At last some anodyne formed itself from these exercises and with eyelashes wet with such feeble tears as only threeoclockinthemorning pathos can distil she fell asleep
Part 5 Pursuant to some altogether private calculations she did not go up to the Imperial College until after midday and she found the laboratory deserted even as she desired
She went to the table under the end window at which she had been accustomed to work and found it swept and garnished with full bottles of reagents
Everything was very neat it had evidently been straightened up and kept for her
She put down the sketchbooks and apparatus she had brought with her pulled out her stool and sat down
As she did so the preparationroom door opened behind her
She heard it open but as she felt unable to look round in a careless manner she pretended not to hear it
Then Capes footsteps approached
She turned with an effort
I expected you this morning he said
I sawthey knocked off your fetters yesterday
I think it is very good of me to come this afternoon
I began to be afraid you might not come at all
Afraid
Yes
Im glad youre back for all sorts of reasons
He spoke a little nervously
Among other things you know I didnt understand quiteI didnt understand that you were so keenly interested in this suffrage question
I have it on my conscience that I offended you Offended me when
Ive been haunted by the memory of you
I was rude and stupid
We were talking about the suffrageand I rather scoffed
You werent rude she said
I didnt know you were so keen on this suffrage business
Nor I
You havent had it on your mind all this time
I have rather
I felt somehow Id hurt you
You didnt
II hurt myself
I mean I behaved like an idiot thats all
My nerves were in rags
I was worried
Were the hysterical animal Mr Capes
I got myself locked up to cool off
By a sort of instinct
As a dog eats grass
Im right again now
Because your nerves were exposed that was no excuse for my touching them
I ought to have seen It doesnt matter a rapif youre not disposed to resent thethe way I behaved
I resent
I was only sorry Id been so stupid
Well I take it were straight again said Capes with a note of relief and assumed an easier position on the edge of her table
But if you werent keen on the suffrage business why on earth did you go to prison
Ann Veronica reflected
It was a phase she said
He smiled
Its a new phase in the life history he remarked
Everybody seems to have it now
Everybody whos going to develop into a woman
Theres Miss Garvice
Shes coming on said Capes
And you know youre altering us all
IM shaken
The campaigns a success
He met her questioning eye and repeated Oh
it IS a success
A man is so apt toto take women a little too lightly
Unless they remind him now and then not to



YOU did
Then I didnt waste my time in prison altogether
It wasnt the prison impressed me
But I liked the things you said here
I felt suddenly I understood youas an intelligent person
If youll forgive my saying that and implying what goes with it
Theres somethingpuppyish in a mans usual attitude to women
That is what Ive had on my conscience



I dont think were altogether to blame if we dont take some of your lot seriously
Some of your sex I mean
But we smirk a little Im afraid habitually when we talk to you
We smirk and were a bitfurtive
He paused with his eyes studying her gravely
You anyhow dont deserve it he said
Their colloquy was ended abruptly by the apparition of Miss Klegg at the further door
When she saw Ann Veronica she stood for a moment as if entranced and then advanced with outstretched hands
Veronique
she cried with a rising intonation though never before had she called Ann Veronica anything but Miss Stanley and seized her and squeezed her and kissed her with profound emotion
To think that you were going to do itand never said a word
You are a little thin but except for that you lookyou look better than ever
Was it VERY horrible
I tried to get into the policecourt but the crowd was ever so much too big push as I would



I mean to go to prison directly the session is over said Miss Klegg
Wild horsesnot if they have all the mounted police in Londonshant keep me out
Part 6 Capes lit things wonderfully for Ann Veronica all that afternoon he was so friendly so palpably interested in her and glad to have her back with him
Tea in the laboratory was a sort of suffragette reception
Miss Garvice assumed a quality of neutrality professed herself almost won over by Ann Veronicas example and the Scotchman decided that if women had a distinctive sphere it was at any rate an enlarging sphere and no one who believed in the doctrine of evolution could logically deny the vote to women ultimately however much they might be disposed to doubt the advisability of its immediate concession
It was a refusal of expediency he said and not an absolute refusal
The youth with his hair like Russell cleared his throat and said rather irrelevantly that he knew a man who knew Thomas Bayard Simmons who had rioted in the Strangers Gallery and then Capes finding them all distinctly proAnn Veronica if not profeminist ventured to be perverse and started a vein of speculation upon the Scotchmans ideathat there were still hopes of women evolving into something higher
He was unusually absurd and ready and all the time it seemed to Ann Veronica as a delightful possibility as a thing not indeed to be entertained seriously but to be half furtively felt that he was being so agreeable because she had come back again
She returned home through a world that was as roseate as it had been gray overnight
But as she got out of the train at Morningside Park Station she had a shock
She saw twenty yards down the platform the shiny hat and broad back and inimitable swagger of Ramage
She dived at once behind the cover of the lamproom and affected serious trouble with her shoelace until he was out of the station and then she followed slowly and with extreme discretion until the bifurcation of the Avenue from the field way insured her escape
Ramage went up the Avenue and she hurried along the path with a beating heart and a disagreeable sense of unsolved problems in her mind
That things going on she told herself
Everything goes on confound it
One doesnt change anything one has set going by making good resolutions
And then ahead of her she saw the radiant and welcoming figure of Manning
He came as an agreeable diversion from an insoluble perplexity
She smiled at the sight of him and thereat his radiation increased
I missed the hour of your release he said but I was at the Vindicator Restaurant
You did not see me I know
I was among the common herd in the place below but I took good care to see you
Of course youre converted
she said
To the view that all those Splendid Women in the movement ought to have votes
Rather
Who could help it
He towered up over her and smiled down at her in his fatherly way
To the view that all women ought to have votes whether they like it or not
He shook his head and his eyes and the mouth under the black mustache wrinkled with his smile
And as he walked by her side they began a wrangle that was none the less pleasant to Ann Veronica because it served to banish a disagreeable preoccupation
It seemed to her in her restored geniality that she liked Manning extremely
The brightness Capes had diffused over the world glorified even his rival
Part 7 The steps by which Ann Veronica determined to engage herself to marry Manning were never very clear to her
A medley of motives warred in her and it was certainly not one of the least of these that she knew herself to be passionately in love with Capes at moments she had a giddy intimation that he was beginning to feel keenly interested in her
She realized more and more the quality of the brink upon which she stoodthe dreadful readiness with which in certain moods she might plunge the unmitigated wrongness and recklessness of such a selfabandonment
He must never know she would whisper to herself he must never know
Or elseElse it will be impossible that I can be his friend
That simple statement of the case was by no means all that went on in Ann Veronicas mind
But it was the form of her ruling determination it was the only form that she ever allowed to see daylight
What else was there lurked in shadows and deep places if in some mood of reverie it came out into the light it was presently overwhelmed and hustled back again into hiding
She would never look squarely at these dream forms that mocked the social order in which she lived never admit she listened to the soft whisperings in her ear
But Manning seemed more and more clearly indicated as a refuge as security
Certain simple purposes emerged from the disingenuous muddle of her feelings and desires
Seeing Capes from day to day made a bright eventfulness that hampered her in the course she had resolved to follow
She vanished from the laboratory for a week a week of oddly interesting days



When she renewed her attendance at the Imperial College the third finger of her left hand was adorned with a very fine old ring with dark blue sapphires that had once belonged to a greataunt of Mannings
That ring manifestly occupied her thoughts a great deal
She kept pausing in her work and regarding it and when Capes came round to her she first put her hand in her lap and then rather awkwardly in front of him
But men are often blind to rings
He seemed to be
In the afternoon she had considered certain doubts very carefully and decided on a more emphatic course of action
Are these ordinary sapphires
she said
He bent to her hand and she slipped off the ring and gave it to him to examine
Very good he said
Rather darker than most of them
But Im generously ignorant of gems
Is it an old ring
he asked returning it
I believe it is
Its an engagement ring



She slipped it on her finger and added in a voice she tried to make matteroffact It was given to me last week
Oh
he said in a colorless tone and with his eyes on her face
Yes
Last week
She glanced at him and it was suddenly apparent for one instant of illumination that this ring upon her finger was the crowning blunder of her life
It was apparent and then it faded into the quality of an inevitable necessity
Odd
he remarked rather surprisingly after a little interval
There was a brief pause a crowded pause between them
She sat very still and his eyes rested on that ornament for a moment and then travelled slowly to her wrist and the soft lines of her forearm
I suppose I ought to congratulate you he said
Their eyes met and his expressed perplexity and curiosity
The fact isI dont know whythis takes me by surprise
Somehow I havent connected the idea with you
You seemed completewithout that
Did I
she said
I dont know why
But this is likelike walking round a house that looks square and complete and finding an unexpected long wing running out behind
She looked up at him and found he was watching her closely
For some seconds of voluminous thinking they looked at the ring between them and neither spoke
Then Capes shifted his eyes to her microscope and the little trays of unmounted sections beside it
How is that carmine working
he asked with a forced interest
Better said Ann Veronica with an unreal alacrity
But it still misses the nucleolus
CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH THE SAPPHIRE RING Part 1 For a time that ring set with sapphires seemed to be after all the satisfactory solution of Ann Veronicas difficulties
It was like pouring a strong acid over dulled metal
A tarnish of constraint that had recently spread over her intercourse with Capes vanished again
They embarked upon an open and declared friendship
They even talked about friendship
They went to the Zoological Gardens together one Saturday to see for themselves a point of morphological interest about the toucans billthat friendly and entertaining birdand they spent the rest of the afternoon walking about and elaborating in general terms this theme and the superiority of intellectual fellowship to all merely passionate relationships
Upon this topic Capes was heavy and conscientious but that seemed to her to be just exactly what he ought to be
He was also had she known it more than a little insincere
We are only in the dawn of the Age of Friendship he said when interest I suppose will take the place of passions
Either you have had to love people or hate themwhich is a sort of love too in its wayto get anything out of them
Now more and more were going to be interested in them to be curious about them andquite mildlyexperimental with them
He seemed to be elaborating ideas as he talked
They watched the chimpanzees in the new apes house and admired the gentle humanity of their eyesso much more human than human beings and they watched the Agile Gibbon in the next apartment doing wonderful leaps and aerial somersaults
I wonder which of us enjoys that most said Capesdoes he or do we
He seems to get a zest He does it and forgets it
We remember it
These joyful bounds just lace into the stuff of my memories and stay there forever
Livings just material
Its very good to be alive
Its better to know life than be life
One may do both said Ann Veronica
She was in a very uncritical state that afternoon
When he said Lets go and see the warthog she thought no one ever had had so quick a flow of good ideas as he and when he explained that sugar and not buns was the talisman of popularity among the animals she marvelled at his practical omniscience
Finally at the exit into Regents Park they ran against Miss Klegg
It was the expression of Miss Kleggs face that put the idea into Ann Veronicas head of showing Manning at the College one day an idea which she didnt for some reason or other carry out for a fortnight
Part 2 When at last she did so the sapphire ring took on a new quality in the imagination of Capes
It ceased to be the symbol of liberty and a remote and quite abstracted person and became suddenly and very disagreeably the token of a large and portentous body visible and tangible
Manning appeared just at the end of the afternoons work and the biologist was going through some perplexities the Scotchman had created by a metaphysical treatment of the skulls of Hyrax and a young African elephant
He was clearing up these difficulties by tracing a partially obliterated suture the Scotchman had overlooked when the door from the passage opened and Manning came into his universe
Seen down the length of the laboratory Manning looked a very handsome and shapely gentleman indeed and at the sight of his eager advance to his fiancee Miss Klegg replaced one longcherished romance about Ann Veronica by one more normal and simple
He carried a cane and a silk hat with a mourningband in one graygloved hand his frockcoat and trousers were admirable his handsome face his black mustache his prominent brow conveyed an eager solicitude
I want he said with a white hand outstretched to take you out to tea
Ive been clearing up said Ann Veronica brightly
All your dreadful scientific things
he said with a smile that Miss Klegg thought extraordinarily kindly
All my dreadful scientific things said Ann Veronica
He stood back smiling with an air of proprietorship and looking about him at the businesslike equipment of the room
The low ceiling made him seem abnormally tall
Ann Veronica wiped a scalpel put a card over a watchglass containing thin shreds of embryonic guineapig swimming in mauve stain and dismantled her microscope
I wish I understood more of biology said Manning
Im ready said Ann Veronica closing her microscopebox with a click and looking for one brief instant up the laboratory
We have no airs and graces here and my hat hangs from a peg in the passage
She led the way to the door and Manning passed behind her and round her and opened the door for her
When Capes glanced up at them for a moment Manning seemed to be holding his arms all about her and there was nothing but quiet acquiescence in her bearing
After Capes had finished the Scotchmans troubles he went back into the preparationroom
He sat down on the sill of the open window folded his arms and stared straight before him for a long time over the wilderness of tiles and chimneypots into a sky that was blue and empty
He was not addicted to monologue and the only audible comment he permitted himself at first upon a universe that was evidently anything but satisfactory to him that afternoon was one compact and entirely unassigned Damn
The word must have had some gratifying quality because he repeated it
Then he stood up and repeated it again
The fool I have been
he cried and now speech was coming to him
He tried this sentence with expletives
Ass
he went on still warming
Muckheaded moral ass
I ought to have done anything
I ought to have done anything
Whats a man for
Friendship
He doubled up his fist and seemed to contemplate thrusting it through the window
He turned his back on that temptation
Then suddenly he seized a new preparation bottle that stood upon his table and contained the better part of a weeks worka displayed dissection of a snail beautifully doneand hurled it across the room to smash resoundingly upon the cemented floor under the bookcase then without either haste or pause he swept his arm along a shelf of reagents and sent them to mingle with the debris on the floor
They fell in a diapason of smashes
Hm
he said regarding the wreckage with a calmer visage
Silly
he remarked after a pause
One hardly knowsall the time
He put his hands in his pockets his mouth puckered to a whistle and he went to the door of the outer preparationroom and stood there looking save for the faintest intensification of his natural ruddiness the embodiment of blond serenity
Gellett he called just come and clear up a mess will you
Ive smashed some things
Part 3 There was one serious flaw in Ann Veronicas arrangements for selfrehabilitation and that was Ramage
He hung over herhe and his loan to her and his connection with her and that terrible eveninga vague disconcerting possibility of annoyance and exposure
She could not see any relief from this anxiety except repayment and repayment seemed impossible
The raising of twentyfive pounds was a task altogether beyond her powers
Her birthday was four months away and that at its extremist point might give her another five pounds
The thing rankled in her mind night and day
She would wake in the night to repeat her bitter cry Oh why did I burn those notes
It added greatly to the annoyance of the situation that she had twice seen Ramage in the Avenue since her return to the shelter of her fathers roof
He had saluted her with elaborate civility his eyes distended with indecipherable meanings
She felt she was bound in honor to tell the whole affair to Manning sooner or later
Indeed it seemed inevitable that she must clear it up with his assistance or not at all
And when Manning was not about the thing seemed simple enough
She would compose extremely lucid and honorable explanations
But when it came to broaching them it proved to be much more difficult than she had supposed
They went down the great staircase of the building and while she sought in her mind for a beginning he broke into appreciation of her simple dress and selfcongratulations upon their engagement
It makes me feel he said that nothing is impossibleto have you here beside me
I said that day at Surbiton Theres many good things in life but theres only one best and thats the wildhaired girl whos pulling away at that oar
I will make her my Grail and some day perhaps if God wills she shall become my wife
 He looked very hard before him as he said this and his voice was full of deep feeling
Grail
said Ann Veronica and then Oh yesof course
Anything but a holy one Im afraid
Altogether holy Ann Veronica
Ah
but you cant imagine what you are to me and what you mean to me
I suppose there is something mystical and wonderful about all women
There is something mystical and wonderful about all human beings
I dont see that men need bank it with the women
A man does said Manninga true man anyhow
And for me there is only one treasurehouse
By Jove
When I think of it I want to leap and shout
It would astonish that man with the barrow
It astonishes me that I dont said Manning in a tone of intense selfenjoyment
I think began Ann Veronica that you dont realize He disregarded her entirely
He waved an arm and spoke with a peculiar resonance
I feel like a giant
I believe now I shall do great things
Gods
what it must be to pour out strong splendid versemighty lines
mighty lines
If I do Ann Veronica it will be you
It will be altogether you
I will dedicate my books to you
I will lay them all at your feet
He beamed upon her
I dont think you realize Ann Veronica began again that I am rather a defective human being
I dont want to said Manning
They say there are spots on the sun
Not for me
It warms me and lights me and fills my world with flowers
Why should I peep at it through smoked glass to see things that dont affect me
He smiled his delight at his companion
Ive got bad faults
He shook his head slowly smiling mysteriously
But perhaps I want to confess them
I grant you absolution
I dont want absolution
I want to make myself visible to you
I wish I could make you visible to yourself
I dont believe in the faults
Theyre just a joyous softening of the outlinemore beautiful than perfection
Like the flaws of an old marble
If you talk of your faults I shall talk of your splendors
I do want to tell you things nevertheless
Well have thank God
ten myriad days to tell each other things
When I think of it But these are things I want to tell you now
I made a little song of it
Let me say it to you
Ive no name for it yet
Epithalamy might do
Like him who stood on Darien I view uncharted sea Ten thousand days ten thousand nights Before my Queen and me
And that only brings me up to about sixtyfive
A glittering wilderness of time That to the sunset reaches No keel as yet its waves has ploughed Or gritted on its beaches
And we will sail that splendor wide From day to day together From isle to isle of happiness Through years of Gods own weather
Yes said his prospective fellowsailor thats very pretty
She stopped short full of things unsaid
Pretty
Ten thousand days ten thousand nights
You shall tell me your faults said Manning
If they matter to you they matter
It isnt precisely faults said Ann Veronica
Its something that bothers me
Ten thousand
Put that way it seemed so different
Then assuredly
said Manning
She found a little difficulty in beginning
She was glad when he went on I want to be your city of refuge from every sort of bother
I want to stand between you and all the force and vileness of the world
I want to make you feel that here is a place where the crowd does not clamor nor illwinds blow
That is all very well said Ann Veronica unheeded
That is my dream of you said Manning warming
I want my life to be beaten gold just in order to make it a fitting setting for yours
There you will be in an inner temple
I want to enrich it with hangings and gladden it with verses
I want to fill it with fine and precious things
And by degrees perhaps that maiden distrust of yours that makes you shrink from my kisses will vanish



Forgive me if a certain warmth creeps into my words
The Park is green and gray today but I am glowing pink and gold



It is difficult to express these things
Part 4 They sat with tea and strawberries and cream before them at a little table in front of the pavilion in Regents Park
Her confession was still unmade
Manning leaned forward on the table talking discursively on the probable brilliance of their married life
Ann Veronica sat back in an attitude of inattention her eyes on a distant game of cricket her mind perplexed and busy
She was recalling the circumstances under which she had engaged herself to Manning and trying to understand a curious development of the quality of this relationship
The particulars of her engagement were very clear in her memory
She had taken care he should have this momentous talk with her on a gardenseat commanded by the windows of the house
They had been playing tennis with his manifest intention looming over her
Let us sit down for a moment he had said
He made his speech a little elaborately
She plucked at the knots of her racket and heard him to the end then spoke in a restrained undertone
You ask me to be engaged to you Mr Manning she began
I want to lay all my life at your feet
Mr Manning I do not think I love you



I want to be very plain with you
I have nothing nothing that can possibly be passion for you
I am sure
Nothing at all
He was silent for some moments
Perhaps that is only sleeping he said
How can you know
I thinkperhaps I am rather a coldblooded person
She stopped
He remained listening attentively
You have been very kind to me she said
I would give my life for you
Her heart had warmed toward him
It had seemed to her that life might be very good indeed with his kindliness and sacrifice about her
She thought of him as always courteous and helpful as realizing indeed his ideal of protection and service as chivalrously leaving her free to live her own life rejoicing with an infinite generosity in every detail of her irresponsive being
She twanged the catgut under her fingers
It seems so unfair she said to take all you offer me and give so little in return
It is all the world to me
And we are not traders looking at equivalents
You know Mr Manning I do not really want to marry
No
It seems soso unworthyshe picked among her phrases of the noble love you give She stopped through the difficulty she found in expressing herself
But I am judge of that said Manning
Would you wait for me
Manning was silent for a space
As my lady wills
Would you let me go on studying for a time
If you order patience
I think Mr Manning 


I do not know
It is so difficult
When I think of the love you give meOne ought to give you back love
You like me
Yes
And I am grateful to you



Manning tapped with his racket on the turf through some moments of silence
You are the most perfect the most glorious of created thingstender frank intellectual brave beautiful
I am your servitor
I am ready to wait for you to wait your pleasure to give all my life to winning it
Let me only wear your livery
Give me but leave to try
You want to think for a time to be free for a time
That is so like you DianaPallas Athene
Pallas Athene is better
You are all the slender goddesses
I understand
Let me engage myself
That is all I ask
She looked at him his face downcast and in profile was handsome and strong
Her gratitude swelled within her
You are too good for me she said in a low voice
Then youyou will
A long pause
It isnt fair



But will you
YES
For some seconds he had remained quite still
If I sit here he said standing up before her abruptly I shall have to shout
Let us walk about
Tum tum tirray tum tum tum tetumthat thing of Mendelssohns
If making one human being absolutely happy is any satisfaction to you He held out his hands and she also stood up
He drew her close up to him with a strong steady pull
Then suddenly in front of all those windows he folded her in his arms and pressed her to him and kissed her unresisting face
Dont
cried Ann Veronica struggling faintly and he released her
Forgive me he said
But I am at singingpitch
She had a moment of sheer panic at the thing she had done
Mr Manning she said for a timeWill you tell no one
Will you keep thisour secret
Im doubtful Will you please not even tell my aunt
As you will he said
But if my manner tells
I cannot help it if that shows
You only mean a secret for a little time
Just for a little time she said yes



But the ring and her aunts triumphant eye and a note of approval in her fathers manner and a novel disposition in him to praise Manning in a just impartial voice had soon placed very definite qualifications upon that covenanted secrecy
Part 5 At first the quality of her relationship to Manning seemed moving and beautiful to Ann Veronica
She admired and rather pitied him and she was unfeignedly grateful to him
She even thought that perhaps she might come to love him in spite of that faint indefinable flavor of absurdity that pervaded his courtly bearing
She would never love him as she loved Capes of course but there are grades and qualities of love
For Manning it would be a more temperate love altogether
Much more temperate the discreet and joyless love of a virtuous reluctant condescending wife
She had been quite convinced that an engagement with him and at last a marriage had exactly that quality of compromise which distinguishes the ways of the wise
It would be the wrappered world almost at its best
She saw herself building up a life upon thata life restrained kindly beautiful a little pathetic and altogether dignified a life of great disciplines and suppressions and extensive reserves


But the Ramage affair needed clearing up of course it was a flaw upon that project
She had to explain about and pay off that forty pounds



Then quite insensibly her queenliness had declined
She was never able to trace the changes her attitude had undergone from the time when she believed herself to be the pampered Queen of Fortune the crown of a good mans love and secretly but nobly worshipping some one else to the time when she realized she was in fact just a mannequin for her lovers imagination and that he cared no more for the realities of her being for the things she felt and desired for the passions and dreams that might move her than a child cares for the sawdust in its doll
She was the actress his whim had chosen to play a passive part



It was one of the most educational disillusionments in Ann Veronicas career
But did many women get anything better
This afternoon when she was urgent to explain her hampering and tainting complication with Ramage the realization of this alien quality in her relationship with Manning became acute
Hitherto it had been qualified by her conception of all life as a compromise by her new effort to be unexacting of life
But she perceived that to tell Manning of her Ramage adventures as they had happened would be like tarring figures upon a watercolor
They were in different key they had a different timbre
How could she tell him what indeed already began to puzzle herself why she had borrowed that money at all
The plain fact was that she had grabbed a bait
She had grabbed
She became less and less attentive to his meditative selfcomplacent fragments of talk as she told herself this
Her secret thoughts made some hasty halfhearted excursions into the possibility of telling the thing in romantic tonesRamage was as a black villain she as a white fantastically white maiden



She doubted if Manning would even listen to that
He would refuse to listen and absolve her unshriven
Then it came to her with a shock as an extraordinary oversight that she could never tell Manning about Ramagenever
She dismissed the idea of doing so
But that still left the forty pounds



Her mind went on generalizing
So it would always be between herself and Manning
She saw her life before her robbed of all generous illusions the wrappered life unwrappered forever vistas of dull responses crises of makebelieve years of exacting mutual disregard in a misty garden of fine sentiments
But did any woman get anything better from a man
Perhaps every woman conceals herself from a man perforce



She thought of Capes
She could not help thinking of Capes
Surely Capes was different
Capes looked at one and not over one spoke to one treated one as a visible concrete fact
Capes saw her felt for her cared for her greatly even if he did not love her
Anyhow he did not sentimentalize her
And she had been doubting since that walk in the Zoological Gardens whether indeed he did simply care for her
Little things almost impalpable had happened to justify that doubt something in his manner had belied his words
Did he not look for her in the morning when she enteredcome very quickly to her
She thought of him as she had last seen him looking down the length of the laboratory to see her go
Why had he glanced upquite in that way



The thought of Capes flooded her being like longveiled sunlight breaking again through clouds
It came to her like a dear thing rediscovered that she loved Capes
It came to her that to marry any one but Capes was impossible
If she could not marry him she would not marry any one
She would end this sham with Manning
It ought never to have begun
It was cheating pitiful cheating
And then if some day Capes wanted hersaw fit to alter his views upon friendship



Dim possibilities that she would not seem to look at even to herself gesticulated in the twilight background of her mind
She leaped suddenly at a desperate resolution and in one moment had made it into a new self
She flung aside every plan she had in life every discretion
Of course why not
She would be honest anyhow
She turned her eyes to Manning
He was sitting back from the table now with one arm over the back of his green chair and the other resting on the little table
He was smiling under his heavy mustache and his head was a little on one side as he looked at her
And what was that dreadful confession you had to make
he was saying
His quiet kindly smile implied his serene disbelief in any confessible thing
Ann Veronica pushed aside a teacup and the vestiges of her strawberries and cream and put her elbows before her on the table
Mr Manning she said I HAVE a confession to make
I wish you would use my Christian name he said
She attended to that and then dismissed it as unimportant
Something in her voice and manner conveyed an effect of unwonted gravity to him
For the first time he seemed to wonder what it might be that she had to confess
His smile faded
I dont think our engagement can go on she plunged and felt exactly that loss of breath that comes with a dive into icy water
But how he said sitting up astonished beyond measure not go on
I have been thinking while you have been talking
You seeI didnt understand
She stared hard at her fingernails
It is hard to express ones self but I do want to be honest with you
When I promised to marry you I thought I could I thought it was a possible arrangement
I did think it could be done
I admired your chivalry
I was grateful
She paused
Go on he said
She moved her elbow nearer to him and spoke in a still lower tone
I told you I did not love you
I know said Manning nodding gravely
It was fine and brave of you
But there is something more
She paused again
II am sorry I didnt explain
These things are difficult
It wasnt clear to me that I had to explain



I love some one else
They remained looking at each other for three or four seconds
Then Manning flopped back in his chair and dropped his chin like a man shot
There was a long silence between them
My God
he said at last with tremendous feeling and then again My God
Now that this thing was said her mind was clear and calm
She heard this standard expression of a strong soul wrung with a critical coldness that astonished herself
She realized dimly that there was no personal thing behind his cry that countless myriads of Mannings had My God
ed with an equal gusto at situations as flatly apprehended
This mitigated her remorse enormously
He rested his brow on his hand and conveyed magnificent tragedy by his pose
But why he said in the gasping voice of one subduing an agony and looked at her from under a painwrinkled brow why did you not tell me this before
I didnt know I thought I might be able to control myself
And you cant
I dont think I ought to control myself
And I have been dreaming and thinking I am frightfully sorry



But This bolt from the blue
My God
Ann Veronica you dont understand
Thisthis shatters a world
She tried to feel sorry but her sense of his immense egotism was strong and clear
He went on with intense urgency
Why did you ever let me love you
Why did you ever let me peep through the gates of Paradise
Oh
my God
I dont begin to feel and realize this yet
It seems to me just talk it seems to me like the fancy of a dream
Tell me I havent heard
This is a joke of yours
He made his voice very low and full and looked closely into her face
She twisted her fingers tightly
It isnt a joke she said
I feel shabby and disgraced



I ought never to have thought of it
Of you I mean



He fell back in his chair with an expression of tremendous desolation
My God
he said again



They became aware of the waitress standing over them with book and pencil ready for their bill
Never mind the bill said Manning tragically standing up and thrusting a fourshilling piece into her hand and turning a broad back on her astonishment
Let us walk across the Park at least he said to Ann Veronica
Just at present my mind simply wont take hold of this at all



I tell younever mind the bill
Keep it
Keep it
Part 6 They walked a long way that afternoon
They crossed the Park to the westward and then turned back and walked round the circle about the Royal Botanical Gardens and then southwardly toward Waterloo
They trudged and talked and Manning struggled as he said to get the hang of it all
It was a long meandering talk stupid shameful and unavoidable
Ann Veronica was apologetic to the bottom of her soul
At the same time she was wildly exultant at the resolution she had taken the end she had made to her blunder
She had only to get through this to solace Manning as much as she could to put such clumsy plasterings on his wounds as were possible and then anyhow she would be freefree to put her fate to the test
She made a few protests a few excuses for her action in accepting him a few lame explanations but he did not heed them or care for them
Then she realized that it was her business to let Manning talk and impose his own interpretations upon the situation so far as he was concerned
She did her best to do this
But about his unknown rival he was acutely curious
He made her tell him the core of the difficulty
I cannot say who he is said Ann Veronica but he is a married man



No
I do not even know that he cares for me
It is no good going into that
Only I just want him
I just want him and no one else will do
It is no good arguing about a thing like that
But you thought you could forget him
I suppose I must have thought so
I didnt understand
Now I do
By God
said Manning making the most of the word I suppose its fate
Fate
You are so frank so splendid
Im taking this calmly now he said almost as if he apologized because Im a little stunned
Then he asked Tell me
has this man has he DARED to make love to you
Ann Veronica had a vicious moment
I wish he had she said
But The long inconsecutive conversation by that time was getting on her nerves
When one wants a thing more than anything else in the world she said with outrageous frankness one naturally wishes one had it
She shocked him by that
She shattered the edifice he was building up of himself as a devoted lover waiting only his chance to win her from a hopeless and consuming passion
Mr Manning she said I warned you not to idealize me
Men ought not to idealize any woman
We arent worth it
Weve done nothing to deserve it
And it hampers us
You dont know the thoughts we have the things we can do and say
You are a sisterless man you have never heard the ordinary talk that goes on at a girls boardingschool
Oh
but you ARE splendid and open and fearless
As if I couldnt allow
What are all these little things
Nothing
Nothing
You cant sully yourself
You cant
I tell you frankly you may break off your engagement to meI shall hold myself still engaged to you yours just the same
As for this infatuationits like some obsession some magic thing laid upon you
Its not younot a bit
Its a thing thats happened to you
It is like some accident
I dont care
In a sense I dont care
It makes no difference



All the same I wish I had that fellow by the throat
Just the virile unregenerate man in me wishes that



I suppose I should let go if I had
You know he went on this doesnt seem to me to end anything
Im rather a persistent person
Im the sort of dog if you turn it out of the room it lies down on the mat at the door
Im not a lovesick boy
Im a man and I know what I mean
Its a tremendous blow of coursebut it doesnt kill me
And the situation it makesthe situation
Thus Manning egotistical inconsecutive unreal
And Ann Veronica walked beside him trying in vain to soften her heart to him by the thought of how she had illused him and all the time as her feet and mind grew weary together rejoicing more and more that at the cost of this one interminable walk she escaped the prospect ofwhat was itTen thousand days ten thousand nights in his company
Whatever happened she need never return to that possibility
For me Manning went on this isnt final
In a sense it alters nothing
I shall still wear your favoreven if it is a stolen and forbidden favorin my casque



I shall still believe in you
Trust you
He repeated several times that he would trust her though it remained obscure just exactly where the trust came in
Look here he cried out of a silence with a sudden flash of understanding did you mean to throw me over when you came out with me this afternoon
Ann Veronica hesitated and with a startled mind realized the truth
No she answered reluctantly
Very well said Manning
Then I dont take this as final
Thats all
Ive bored you or something



You think you love this other man
No doubt you do love him
Before you have lived He became darkly prophetic
He thrust out a rhetorical hand
I will MAKE you love me
Until he has fadedfaded into a memory


He saw her into the train at Waterloo and stood a tall grave figure with hat upraised as the carriage moved forward slowly and hid him
Ann Veronica sat back with a sigh of relief
Manning might go on now idealizing her as much as he liked
She was no longer a confederate in that
He might go on as the devoted lover until he tired
She had done forever with the Age of Chivalry and her own base adaptations of its traditions to the compromising life
She was honest again
But when she turned her thoughts to Morningside Park she perceived the tangled skein of life was now to be further complicated by his romantic importunity
CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH THE COLLAPSE OF THE PENITENT Part 1 Spring had held back that year until the dawn of May and then spring and summer came with a rush together
Two days after this conversation between Manning and Ann Veronica Capes came into the laboratory at lunchtime and found her alone there standing by the open window and not even pretending to be doing anything
He came in with his hands in his trousers pockets and a general air of depression in his bearing
He was engaged in detesting Manning and himself in almost equal measure
His face brightened at the sight of her and he came toward her
What are you doing
he asked
Nothing said Ann Veronica and stared over her shoulder out of the window
So am I 


Lassitude
I suppose so
I cant work
Nor I said Ann Veronica
Pause
Its the spring he said
Its the warming up of the year the coming of the light mornings the way in which everything begins to run about and begin new things
Work becomes distasteful one thinks of holidays
This yearIve got it badly
I want to get away
Ive never wanted to get away so much
Where do you go
OhAlps
Climbing
Yes
Thats rather a fine sort of holiday
He made no answer for three or four seconds
Yes he said I want to get away
I feel at moments as though I could bolt for it



Silly isnt it
Undisciplined
He went to the window and fidgeted with the blind looking out to where the treetops of Regents Park showed distantly over the houses
He turned round toward her and found her looking at him and standing very still
Its the stir of spring he said
I believe it is
She glanced out of the window and the distant trees were a froth of hard spring green and almond blossom
She formed a wild resolution and lest she should waver from it she set about at once to realize it
Ive broken off my engagement she said in a matteroffact tone and found her heart thumping in her neck
He moved slightly and she went on with a slight catching of her breath Its a bother and disturbance but you see She had to go through with it now because she could think of nothing but her preconceived words
Her voice was weak and flat
Ive fallen in love
He never helped her by a sound
II didnt love the man I was engaged to she said
She met his eyes for a moment and could not interpret their expression
They struck her as cold and indifferent
Her heart failed her and her resolution became water
She remained standing stiffly unable even to move
She could not look at him through an interval that seemed to her a vast gulf of time
But she felt his lax figure become rigid
At last his voice came to release her tension
I thought you werent keeping up to the mark
You Its jolly of you to confide in me
Still Then with incredible and obviously deliberate stupidity and a voice as flat as her own he asked Who is the man
Her spirit raged within her at the dumbness the paralysis that had fallen upon her
Grace confidence the power of movement even seemed gone from her
A fever of shame ran through her being
Horrible doubts assailed her
She sat down awkwardly and helplessly on one of the little stools by her table and covered her face with her hands
Cant you SEE how things are
she said
Part 2 Before Capes could answer her in any way the door at the end of the laboratory opened noisily and Miss Klegg appeared
She went to her own table and sat down
At the sound of the door Ann Veronica uncovered a tearless face and with one swift movement assumed a conversational attitude
Things hung for a moment in an awkward silence
You see said Ann Veronica staring before her at the windowsash thats the form my question takes at the present time
Capes had not quite the same power of recovery
He stood with his hands in his pockets looking at Miss Kleggs back
His face was white
Itsits a difficult question
He appeared to be paralyzed by abstruse acoustic calculations
Then very awkwardly he took a stool and placed it at the end of Ann Veronicas table and sat down
He glanced at Miss Klegg again and spoke quickly and furtively with eager eyes on Ann Veronicas face
I had a faint idea once that things were as you say they are but the affair of the ringof the unexpected ringpuzzled me
Wish SHEhe indicated Miss Kleggs back with a nodwas at the bottom of the sea



I would like to talk to you about thissoon
If you dont think it would be a social outrage perhaps I might walk with you to your railway station
I will wait said Ann Veronica still not looking at him and we will go into Regents Park
Noyou shall come with me to Waterloo
Right
he said and hesitated and then got up and went into the preparationroom
Part 3 For a time they walked in silence through the back streets that lead southward from the College
Capes bore a face of infinite perplexity
The thing I feel most disposed to say Miss Stanley he began at last is that this is very sudden
Its been coming on since first I came into the laboratory
What do you want
he asked bluntly
You
said Ann Veronica
The sense of publicity of people coming and going about them kept them both unemotional
And neither had any of that theatricality which demands gestures and facial expression
I suppose you know I like you tremendously
he pursued
You told me that in the Zoological Gardens
She found her muscles atremble
But there was nothing in her bearing that a passerby would have noted to tell of the excitement that possessed her
Ihe seemed to have a difficulty with the wordI love you
Ive told you that practically already
But I can give it its name now
You neednt be in any doubt about it
I tell you that because it puts us on a footing



They went on for a time without another word
But dont you know about me
he said at last
Something
Not much
Im a married man
And my wife wont live with me for reasons that I think most women would consider sound



Or I should have made love to you long ago
There came a silence again
I dont care said Ann Veronica
But if you knew anything of that I did
It doesnt matter
Why did you tell me
I thoughtI thought we were going to be friends
He was suddenly resentful
He seemed to charge her with the ruin of their situation
Why on earth did you TELL me
he cried
I couldnt help it
It was an impulse
I HAD to
But it changes things
I thought you understood
I had to she repeated
I was sick of the makebelieve
I dont care
Im glad I did
Im glad I did
Look here
said Capes what on earth do you want
What do you think we can do
Dont you know what men are and what life isto come to me and talk to me like this
I knowsomething anyhow
But I dont care I havent a spark of shame
I dont see any good in life if it hasnt got you in it
I wanted you to know
And now you know
And the fences are down for good
You cant look me in the eyes and say you dont care for me
Ive told you he said
Very well said Ann Veronica with an air of concluding the discussion
They walked side by side for a time
In that laboratory one gets to disregard these passions began Capes
Men are curious animals with a trick of falling in love readily with girls about your age
One has to train ones self not to
Ive accustomed myself to think of youas if you were like every other girl who works at the schoolsas something quite outside these possibilities
If only out of loyalty to co education one has to do that
Apart from everything else this meeting of ours is a breach of a good rule
Rules are for every day said Ann Veronica
This is not every day
This is something above all rules
For you
Not for you
No
No Im going to stick to the rules



Its odd but nothing but cliche seems to meet this case
Youve placed me in a very exceptional position Miss Stanley
The note of his own voice exasperated him
Oh damn
he said
She made no answer and for a time he debated some problems with himself
No
he said aloud at last
The plain commonsense of the case he said is that we cant possibly be lovers in the ordinary sense
That I think is manifest
You know Ive done no work at all this afternoon
Ive been smoking cigarettes in the preparationroom and thinking this out
We cant be lovers in the ordinary sense but we can be great and intimate friends
We are said Ann Veronica
Youve interested me enormously



He paused with a sense of ineptitude
I want to be your friend he said
I said that at the Zoo and I mean it
Let us be friendsas near and close as friends can be
Ann Veronica gave him a pallid profile
What is the good of pretending
she said
We dont pretend
We do
Love is one thing and friendship quite another
Because Im younger than you



Ive got imagination



I know what I am talking about
Mr Capes do you think 


do you think I dont know the meaning of love
Part 4 Capes made no answer for a time
My mind is full of confused stuff he said at length
Ive been thinkingall the afternoon
Oh and weeks and months of thought and feeling there are bottled up too



I feel a mixture of beast and uncle
I feel like a fraudulent trustee
Every rule is against me Why did I let you begin this
I might have told I dont see that you could help I might have helped You couldnt
I ought to haveall the same
I wonder he said and went off at a tangent
You know about my scandalous past
Very little
It doesnt seem to matter
Does it
I think it does
Profoundly
How
It prevents our marrying
It forbidsall sorts of things
It cant prevent our loving
Im afraid it cant
But by Jove
its going to make our loving a fiercely abstract thing
You are separated from your wife
Yes but do you know how
Not exactly
Why on earth
A man ought to be labelled
You see Im separated from my wife
But she doesnt and wont divorce me
You dont understand the fix I am in
And you dont know what led to our separation
And in fact all round the problem you dont know and I dont see how I could possibly have told you before
I wanted to that day in the Zoo
But I trusted to that ring of yours
Poor old ring
said Ann Veronica
I ought never have gone to the Zoo I suppose
I asked you to go
But a man is a mixed creature



I wanted the time with you
I wanted it badly
Tell me about yourself said Ann Veronica
To begin with I wasI was in the divorce court
I wasI was a corespondent
You understand that term
Ann Veronica smiled faintly
A modern girl does understand these terms
She reads novelsand history and all sorts of things
Did you really doubt if I knew
No
But I dont suppose you can understand
I dont see why I shouldnt
To know things by name is one thing to know them by seeing them and feeling them and being them quite another
That is where life takes advantage of youth
You dont understand
Perhaps I dont
You dont
Thats the difficulty
If I told you the facts I expect since you are in love with me youd explain the whole business as being very fine and honorable for methe Higher Morality or something of that sort



It wasnt
I dont deal very much said Ann Veronica in the Higher Morality or the Higher Truth or any of those things
Perhaps you dont
But a human being who is young and clean as you are is apt to ennobleor explain away
Ive had a biological training
Im a hard young woman
Nice clean hardness anyhow
I think you are hard
Theres somethingsomething ADULT about you
Im talking to you now as though you had all the wisdom and charity in the world
Im going to tell you things plainly
Plainly
Its best
And then you can go home and think things over before we talk again
I want you to be clear what youre really and truly up to anyhow
I dont mind knowing said Ann Veronica
Its precious unromantic
Well tell me
I married pretty young said Capes
Ive gotI have to tell you this to make myself cleara streak of ardent animal in my composition
I marriedI married a woman whom I still think one of the most beautiful persons in the world
She is a year or so older than I am and she is well of a very serene and proud and dignified temperament
If you met her you would I am certain think her as fine as I do
She has never done a really ignoble thing that I know ofnever
I met her when we were both very young as young as you are
I loved her and made love to her and I dont think she quite loved me back in the same way
He paused for a time
Ann Veronica said nothing
These are the sort of things that arent supposed to happen
They leave them out of novelsthese incompatibilities
Young people ignore them until they find themselves up against them
My wife doesnt understand doesnt understand now
She despises me I suppose



We married and for a time we were happy
She was fine and tender
I worshipped her and subdued myself
He left off abruptly
Do you understand what I am talking about
Its no good if you dont
I think so said Ann Veronica and colored
In fact yes I do
Do you think of these thingsthese mattersas belonging to our Higher Nature or our Lower
I dont deal in Higher Things I tell you said Ann Veronica or Lower for the matter of that
I dont classify
She hesitated
Flesh and flowers are all alike to me
Thats the comfort of you
Well after a time there came a fever in my blood
Dont think it was anything better than feveror a bit beautiful
It wasnt
Quite soon after we were marriedit was just within a yearI formed a friendship with the wife of a friend a woman eight years older than myself



It wasnt anything splendid you know
It was just a shabby stupid furtive business that began between us
Like stealing
We dressed it in a little music



I want you to understand clearly that I was indebted to the man in many small ways
I was mean to him



It was the gratification of an immense necessity
We were two people with a craving
We felt like thieves
We WERE thieves



We LIKED each other well enough
Well my friend found us out and would give no quarter
He divorced her
How do you like the story
Go on said Ann Veronica a little hoarsely tell me all of it
My wife was astoundedwounded beyond measure
She thought mefilthy
All her pride raged at me
One particularly humiliating thing came outhumiliating for me
There was a second corespondent
I hadnt heard of him before the trial
I dont know why that should be so acutely humiliating
Theres no logic in these things
It was
Poor you
said Ann Veronica
My wife refused absolutely to have anything more to do with me
She could hardly speak to me she insisted relentlessly upon a separation
She had money of her ownmuch more than I haveand there was no need to squabble about that
She has given herself up to social work
Well Thats all
Practically all
And yet Wait a little youd better have every bit of it
One doesnt go about with these passions allayed simply because they have made wreckage and a scandal
There one is
The same stuff still
One has a craving in ones blood a craving roused cut off from its redeeming and guiding emotional side
A man has more freedom to do evil than a woman
Irregularly in a quite inglorious and unromantic way you know I am a vicious man
Thats thats my private life
Until the last few months
It isnt what I have been but what I am
I havent taken much account of it until now
My honor has been in my scientific work and public discussion and the things I write
Lots of us are like that
But you see Im smirched
For the sort of lovemaking you think about
Ive muddled all this business
Ive had my time and lost my chances
Im damaged goods
And youre as clean as fire
You come with those clear eyes of yours as valiant as an angel



He stopped abruptly
Well
she said
Thats all
Its so strange to think of youtroubled by such things
I didnt think I dont know what I thought
Suddenly all this makes you human
Makes you real
But dont you see how I must stand to you
Dont you see how it bars us from being lovers You cant at first
You must think it over
Its all outside the world of your experience
I dont think it makes a rap of difference except for one thing
I love you more
Ive wanted youalways
I didnt dream not even in my wildest dreaming thatyou might have any need of me
He made a little noise in his throat as if something had cried out within him and for a time they were both too full for speech
They were going up the slope into Waterloo Station
You go home and think of all this he said and talk about it tomorrow
Dont dont say anything now not anything
As for loving you I do
I dowith all my heart
Its no good hiding it any more
I could never have talked to you like this forgetting everything that parts us forgetting even your age if I did not love you utterly
If I were a clean free manWell have to talk of all these things
Thank goodness theres plenty of opportunity
And we two can talk
Anyhow now youve begun it theres nothing to keep us in all this from being the best friends in the world
And talking of every conceivable thing
Is there
Nothing said Ann Veronica with a radiant face
Before this there was a sort of restrainta makebelieve
Its gone
Its gone
Friendship and love being separate things
And that confounded engagement
Gone
They came upon a platform and stood before her compartment
He took her hand and looked into her eyes and spoke divided against himself in a voice that was forced and insincere
I shall be very glad to have you for a friend he said loving friend
I had never dreamed of such a friend as you
She smiled sure of herself beyond any pretending into his troubled eyes
Hadnt they settled that already
I want you as a friend he persisted almost as if he disputed something
Part 5 The next morning she waited in the laboratory at the lunchhour in the reasonable certainty that he would come to her
Well you have thought it over
he said sitting down beside her
Ive been thinking of you all night she answered
Well
I dont care a rap for all these things
He said nothing for a space
I dont see theres any getting away from the fact that you and I love each other he said slowly
So far youve got me and I you



Youve got me
Im like a creature just wakened up
My eyes are open to you
I keep on thinking of you
I keep on thinking of little details and aspects of your voice your eyes the way you walk the way your hair goes back from the side of your forehead
I believe I have always been in love with you
Always
Before ever I knew you
She sat motionless with her hand tightening over the edge of the table and he too said no more
She began to tremble violently
He stood up abruptly and went to the window
We have he said to be the utmost friends
She stood up and held her arms toward him
I want you to kiss me she said
He gripped the windowsill behind him
If I do he said



No
I want to do without that
I want to do without that for a time
I want to give you time to think
I am a manof a sort of experience
You are a girl with very little
Just sit down on that stool again and lets talk of this in cold blood
People of your sort I dont want the instincts toto rush our situation
Are you sure what it is you want of me
I want you
I want you to be my lover
I want to give myself to you
I want to be whatever I can to you
She paused for a moment
Is that plain
she asked
If I didnt love you better than myself said Capes I wouldnt fence like this with you
I am convinced you havent thought this out he went on
You do not know what such a relation means
We are in love
Our heads swim with the thought of being together
But what can we do
Here am I fixed to respectability and this laboratory youre living at home
It means 


just furtive meetings
I dont care how we meet she said
It will spoil your life
It will make it
I want you
I am clear I want you
You are different from all the world for me
You can think all round me
You are the one person I can understand and feelfeel right with
I dont idealize you
Dont imagine that
It isnt because youre good but because I may be rotten bad and theres somethingsomething living and understanding in you
Something that is born anew each time we meet and pines when we are separated
You see Im selfish
Im rather scornful
I think too much about myself
Youre the only person Ive really given good straight unselfish thought to
Im making a mess of my lifeunless you come in and take it
I am
In youif you can love methere is salvation
Salvation
I know what I am doing better than you do
Thinkthink of that engagement
Their talk had come to eloquent silences that contradicted all he had to say
She stood up before him smiling faintly
I think weve exhausted this discussion she said
I think we have he answered gravely and took her in his arms and smoothed her hair from her forehead and very tenderly kissed her lips
Part 6 They spent the next Sunday in Richmond Park and mingled the happy sensation of being together uninterruptedly through the long sunshine of a summers day with the ample discussion of their position
This has all the clean freshness of spring and youth said Capes it is love with the down on it is like the glitter of dew in the sunlight to be lovers such as we are with no more than one warm kiss between us
I love everything today and all of you but I love this thisthis innocence upon us most of all
You cant imagine he said what a beastly thing a furtive love affair can be
This isnt furtive said Ann Veronica
Not a bit of it
And we wont make it so



We mustnt make it so
They loitered under trees they sat on mossy banks they gossiped on friendly benches they came back to lunch at the Star and Garter and talked their afternoon away in the garden that looks out upon the crescent of the river
They had a universe to talk abouttwo universes
What are we going to do
said Capes with his eyes on the broad distances beyond the ribbon of the river
I will do whatever you want said Ann Veronica
My first love was all blundering said Capes
He thought for a moment and went on Love is something that has to be taken care of
One has to be so careful



Its a beautiful plant but a tender one



I didnt know
Ive a dread of love dropping its petals becoming mean and ugly
How can I tell you all I feel
I love you beyond measure
And Im afraid



Im anxious joyfully anxious like a man when he has found a treasure
YOU know said Ann Veronica
I just came to you and put myself in your hands
Thats why in a way Im prudish
Ivedreads
I dont want to tear at you with hot rough hands
As you will dear lover
But for me it doesnt matter
Nothing is wrong that you do
Nothing
I am quite clear about this
I know exactly what I am doing
I give myself to you
God send you may never repent it
cried Capes
She put her hand in his to be squeezed
You see he said it is doubtful if we can ever marry
Very doubtful
I have been thinking I will go to my wife again
I will do my utmost
But for a long time anyhow we lovers have to be as if we were no more than friends
He paused
She answered slowly
That is as you will she said
Why should it matter
he said
And then as she answered nothing Seeing that we are lovers
Part 7 It was rather less than a week after that walk that Capes came and sat down beside Ann Veronica for their customary talk in the lunch hour
He took a handful of almonds and raisins that she held out to himfor both these young people had given up the practice of going out for luncheonand kept her hand for a moment to kiss her fingertips
He did not speak for a moment
Well
she said
I say
he said without any movement
Lets go
Go
She did not understand him at first and then her heart began to beat very rapidly
Stop thisthis humbugging he explained
Its like the Picture and the Bust
I cant stand it
Lets go
Go off and live togetheruntil we can marry
Dare you
Do you mean NOW
At the end of the session
Its the only clean way for us
Are you prepared to do it
Her hands clenched
Yes she said very faintly
And then Of course
Always
It is what I have wanted what I have meant all along
She stared before her trying to keep back a rush of tears
Capes kept obstinately stiff and spoke between his teeth
Theres endless reasons no doubt why we shouldnt he said
Endless
Its wrong in the eyes of most people
For many of them it will smirch us forever



You DO understand
Who cares for most people
she said not looking at him
I do
It means social isolationstruggle
If you dareI dare said Ann Veronica
I was never so clear in all my life as I have been in this business
She lifted steadfast eyes to him
Dare
she said
The tears were welling over now but her voice was steady
Youre not a man for menot one of a sex I mean
Youre just a particular being with nothing else in the world to class with you
You are just necessary to life for me
Ive never met any one like you
To have you is all important
Nothing else weighs against it
Morals only begin when that is settled
I shant care a rap if we can never marry
Im not a bit afraid of anythingscandal difficulty struggle



I rather want them
I do want them
Youll get them he said
This means a plunge
Are you afraid
Only for you
Most of my income will vanish
Even unbelieving biological demonstrators must respect decorum and besides you seeyou were a student
We shall havehardly any money
I dont care
Hardship and danger
With you
And as for your people
They dont count
That is the dreadful truth
Thisall this swamps them
They dont count and I dont care
Capes suddenly abandoned his attitude of meditative restraint
By Jove
he broke out one tries to take a serious sober view
I dont quite know why
But this is a great lark Ann Veronica
This turns life into a glorious adventure
Ah
she cried in triumph
I shall have to give up biology anyhow
Ive always had a sneaking desire for the writingtrade
That is what I must do
I can
Of course you can
And biology was beginning to bore me a bit
One research is very like another



Latterly Ive been doing things



Creative work appeals to me wonderfully
Things seem to come rather easily



But that and that sort of thing is just a daydream
For a time I must do journalism and work hard



What isnt a daydream is this that you and I are going to put an end to flummeryand go
Go
said Ann Veronica clenching her hands
For better or worse
For richer or poorer
She could not go on for she was laughing and crying at the same time
We were bound to do this when you kissed me she sobbed through her tears
We have been all this time Only your queer code of honor Honor
Once you begin with love you have to see it through
CHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH THE LAST DAYS AT HOME Part 1 They decided to go to Switzerland at the sessions end
Well clean up everything tidy said Capes



For her prides sake and to save herself from long daydreams and an unappeasable longing for her lover Ann Veronica worked hard at her biology during those closing weeks
She was as Capes had said a hard young woman
She was keenly resolved to do well in the school examination and not to be drowned in the seas of emotion that threatened to submerge her intellectual being
Nevertheless she could not prevent a rising excitement as the dawn of the new life drew near to hera thrilling of the nerves a secret and delicious exaltation above the common circumstances of existence
Sometimes her straying mind would become astonishingly activeembroidering bright and decorative things that she could say to Capes sometimes it passed into a state of passive acquiescence into a radiant formless golden joy
She was aware of peopleher aunt her father her fellowstudents friends and neighborsmoving about outside this glowing secret very much as an actor is aware of the dim audience beyond the barrier of the footlights
They might applaud or object or interfere but the drama was her very own
She was going through with that anyhow
The feeling of last days grew stronger with her as their number diminished
She went about the familiar home with a clearer and clearer sense of inevitable conclusions
She became exceptionally considerate and affectionate with her father and aunt and more and more concerned about the coming catastrophe that she was about to precipitate upon them
Her aunt had a once exasperating habit of interrupting her work with demands for small household services but now Ann Veronica rendered them with a queer readiness of anticipatory propitiation
She was greatly exercised by the problem of confiding in the Widgetts they were dears and she talked away two evenings with Constance without broaching the topic she made some vague intimations in letters to Miss Miniver that Miss Miniver failed to mark
But she did not bother her head very much about her relations with these sympathizers
And at length her penultimate day in Morningside Park dawned for her
She got up early and walked about the garden in the dewy June sunshine and revived her childhood
She was saying goodbye to childhood and home and her making she was going out into the great multitudinous world this time there would be no returning
She was at the end of girlhood and on the eve of a womans crowning experience
She visited the corner that had been her own little gardenher forgetmenots and candytuft had long since been elbowed into insignificance by weeds she visited the raspberrycanes that had sheltered that first love affair with the little boy in velvet and the greenhouse where she had been wont to read her secret letters
Here was the place behind the shed where she had used to hide from Roddys persecutions and here the border of herbaceous perennials under whose stems was fairyland
The back of the house had been the Alps for climbing and the shrubs in front of it a Terai
The knots and broken pale that made the gardenfence scalable and gave access to the fields behind were still to be traced
And here against a wall were the plumtrees
In spite of God and wasps and her father she had stolen plums and once because of discovered misdeeds and once because she had realized that her mother was dead she had lain on her face in the unmown grass beneath the elmtrees that came beyond the vegetables and poured out her soul in weeping
Remote little Ann Veronica
She would never know the heart of that child again
That child had loved fairy princes with velvet suits and golden locks and she was in love with a real man named Capes with little gleams of gold on his cheek and a pleasant voice and firm and shapely hands
She was going to him soon and certainly going to his strong embracing arms
She was going through a new world with him side by side
She had been so busy with life that for a vast gulf of time as it seemed she had given no thought to those ancient imagined things of her childhood
Now abruptly they were real again though very distant and she had come to say farewell to them across one sundering year
She was unusually helpful at breakfast and unselfish about the eggs and then she went off to catch the train before her fathers
She did this to please him
He hated travelling secondclass with herindeed he never didbut he also disliked travelling in the same train when his daughter was in an inferior class because of the look of the thing
So he liked to go by a different train
And in the Avenue she had an encounter with Ramage
It was an odd little encounter that left vague and dubitable impressions in her mind
She was aware of hima silkhatted shinyblack figure on the opposite side of the Avenue and then abruptly and startlingly he crossed the road and saluted and spoke to her
I MUST speak to you he said
I cant keep away from you
She made some inane response
She was struck by a change in his appearance
His eyes looked a little bloodshot to her his face had lost something of its ruddy freshness
He began a jerky broken conversation that lasted until they reached the station and left her puzzled at its drift and meaning
She quickened her pace and so did he talking at her slightly averted ear
She made lumpish and inadequate interruptions rather than replies
At times he seemed to be claiming pity from her at times he was threatening her with her check and exposure at times he was boasting of his inflexible will and how in the end he always got what he wanted
He said that his life was boring and stupid without her
Something or othershe did not catch whathe was damned if he could stand
He was evidently nervous and very anxious to be impressive his projecting eyes sought to dominate
The crowning aspect of the incident for her mind was the discovery that he and her indiscretion with him no longer mattered very much
Its importance had vanished with her abandonment of compromise
Even her debt to him was a triviality now
And of course
She had a brilliant idea
It surprised her she hadnt thought of it before
She tried to explain that she was going to pay him forty pounds without fail next week
She said as much to him
She repeated this breathlessly
I was glad you did not send it back again he said
He touched a longstanding sore and Ann Veronica found herself vainly trying to explainthe inexplicable
Its because I mean to send it back altogether she said
He ignored her protests in order to pursue some impressive line of his own
Here we are living in the same suburb he began
We have to bemodern
Her heart leaped within her as she caught that phrase
That knot also would be cut
Modern indeed
She was going to be as primordial as chipped flint
Part 2 In the late afternoon as Ann Veronica was gathering flowers for the dinnertable her father came strolling across the lawn toward her with an affectation of great deliberation
I want to speak to you about a little thing Vee said Mr Stanley
Ann Veronicas tense nerves started and she stood still with her eyes upon him wondering what it might be that impended
You were talking to that fellow Ramage todayin the Avenue
Walking to the station with him
So that was it
He came and talked to me
Yeees
Mr Stanley considered
Well I dont want you to talk to him he said very firmly
Ann Veronica paused before she answered
Dont you think I ought to
she asked very submissively
No
Mr Stanley coughed and faced toward the house
He is not I dont like him
I think it inadvisable I dont want an intimacy to spring up between you and a man of that type
Ann Veronica reflected
I HAVEhad one or two talks with him daddy
Dont let there be any more
I In fact I dislike him extremely
Suppose he comes and talks to me
A girl can always keep a man at a distance if she cares to do it
She She can snub him
Ann Veronica picked a cornflower
I wouldnt make this objection Mr Stanley went on but there are thingsthere are stories about Ramage
HesHe lives in a world of possibilities outside your imagination
His treatment of his wife is most unsatisfactory
Most unsatisfactory
A bad man in fact
A dissipated looseliving man
Ill try not to see him again said Ann Veronica
I didnt know you objected to him daddy
Strongly said Mr Stanley very strongly
The conversation hung
Ann Veronica wondered what her father would do if she were to tell him the full story of her relations with Ramage
A man like that taints a girl by looking at her by his mere conversation
He adjusted his glasses on his nose
There was another little thing he had to say
One has to be so careful of ones friends and acquaintances he remarked by way of transition
They mould one insensibly
His voice assumed an easy detached tone
I suppose Vee you dont see much of those Widgetts now
I go in and talk to Constance sometimes
Do you
We were great friends at school
No doubt



StillI dont know whether I quite likeSomething ramshackle about those people Vee
While I am talking about your friends I feelI think you ought to know how I look at it
His voice conveyed studied moderation
I dont mind of course your seeing her sometimes still there are differencesdifferences in social atmospheres
One gets drawn into things
Before you know where you are you find yourself in a complication
I dont want to influence you undulyButTheyre artistic people Vee
Thats the fact about them
Were different
I suppose we are said Vee rearranging the flowers in her hand
Friendships that are all very well between schoolgirls dont always go on into later life
Itsits a social difference
I like Constance very much
No doubt
Still one has to be reasonable
As you admitted to meone has to square ones self with the world
You dont know
With people of that sort all sorts of things may happen
We dont want things to happen
Ann Veronica made no answer
A vague desire to justify himself ruffled her father
I may seem undulyanxious
I cant forget about your sister
Its that has always made meSHE you know was drawn into a setdidnt discriminate Private theatricals
Ann Veronica remained anxious to hear more of her sisters story from her fathers point of view but he did not go on
Even so much allusion as this to that family shadow she felt was an immense recognition of her ripening years
She glanced at him
He stood a little anxious and fussy bothered by the responsibility of her entirely careless of what her life was or was likely to be ignoring her thoughts and feelings ignorant of every fact of importance in her life explaining everything he could not understand in her as nonsense and perversity concerned only with a terror of bothers and undesirable situations
We dont want things to happen
Never had he shown his daughter so clearly that the womenkind he was persuaded he had to protect and control could please him in one way and in one way only and that was by doing nothing except the punctual domestic duties and being nothing except restful appearances
He had quite enough to see to and worry about in the City without their doing things
He had no use for Ann Veronica he had never had a use for her since she had been too old to sit upon his knee
Nothing but the constraint of social usage now linked him to her
And the less anything happened the better
The less she lived in fact the better
These realizations rushed into Ann Veronicas mind and hardened her heart against him
She spoke slowly
I may not see the Widgetts for some little time father she said
I dont think I shall
Some little tiff
No but I dont think I shall see them
Suppose she were to add I am going away
Im glad to hear you say it said Mr Stanley and was so evidently pleased that Ann Veronicas heart smote her
I am very glad to hear you say it he repeated and refrained from further inquiry
I think we are growing sensible he said
I think you are getting to understand me better
He hesitated and walked away from her toward the house
Her eyes followed him
The curve of his shoulders the very angle of his feet expressed relief at her apparent obedience
Thank goodness
said that retreating aspect thats said and over
Vees all right
Theres nothing happened at all
She didnt mean he concluded to give him any more trouble ever and he was free to begin a fresh chromatic novelhe had just finished the Blue Lagoon which he thought very beautiful and tender and absolutely irrelevant to Morningside Parkor work in peace at his microtome without bothering about her in the least
The immense disillusionment that awaited him
The devastating disillusionment
She had a vague desire to run after him to state her case to him to wring some understanding from him of what life was to her
She felt a cheat and a sneak to his unsuspecting retreating back
But what can one do
asked Ann Veronica
Part 3 She dressed carefully for dinner in a black dress that her father liked and that made her look serious and responsible
Dinner was quite uneventful
Her father read a draft prospectus warily and her aunt dropped fragments of her projects for managing while the cook had a holiday
After dinner Ann Veronica went into the drawingroom with Miss Stanley and her father went up to his den for his pipe and pensive petrography
Later in the evening she heard him whistling poor man
She felt very restless and excited
She refused coffee though she knew that anyhow she was doomed to a sleepless night
She took up one of her fathers novels and put it down again fretted up to her own room for some work sat on her bed and meditated upon the room that she was now really abandoning forever and returned at length with a stocking to darn
Her aunt was making herself cuffs out of little slips of insertion under the newly lit lamp
Ann Veronica sat down in the other armchair and darned badly for a minute or so
Then she looked at her aunt and traced with a curious eye the careful arrangement of her hair her sharp nose the little drooping lines of mouth and chin and cheek
Her thought spoke aloud
Were you ever in love aunt
she asked
Her aunt glanced up startled and then sat very still with hands that had ceased to work
What makes you ask such a question Vee
she said
I wondered
Her aunt answered in a low voice I was engaged to him dear for seven years and then he died
Ann Veronica made a sympathetic little murmur
He was in holy orders and we were to have been married when he got a living
He was a Wiltshire Edmondshaw a very old family
She sat very still
Ann Veronica hesitated with a question that had leaped up in her mind and that she felt was cruel
Are you sorry you waited aunt
she said
Her aunt was a long time before she answered
His stipend forbade it she said and seemed to fall into a train of thought
It would have been rash and unwise she said at the end of a meditation
What he had was altogether insufficient
Ann Veronica looked at the mildly pensive gray eyes and the comfortable rather refined face with a penetrating curiosity
Presently her aunt sighed deeply and looked at the clock
Time for my Patience she said
She got up put the neat cuffs she had made into her workbasket and went to the bureau for the little cards in the morocco case
Ann Veronica jumped up to get her the cardtable
I havent seen the new Patience dear she said
May I sit beside you
Its a very difficult one said her aunt
Perhaps you will help me shuffle
Ann Veronica did and also assisted nimbly with the arrangements of the rows of eight with which the struggle began
Then she sat watching the play sometimes offering a helpful suggestion sometimes letting her attention wander to the smoothly shining arms she had folded across her knees just below the edge of the table
She was feeling extraordinarily well that night so that the sense of her body was a deep delight a realization of a gentle warmth and strength and elastic firmness
Then she glanced at the cards again over which her aunts manyringed hand played and then at the rather weak rather plump face that surveyed its operations
It came to Ann Veronica that life was wonderful beyond measure
It seemed incredible that she and her aunt were indeed creatures of the same blood only by a birth or so different beings and part of that same broad interlacing stream of human life that has invented the fauns and nymphs Astarte Aphrodite Freya and all the twining beauty of the gods
The lovesongs of all the ages were singing in her blood the scent of night stock from the garden filled the air and the moths that beat upon the closed frames of the window next the lamp set her mind dreaming of kisses in the dusk
Yet her aunt with a ringed hand flitting to her lips and a puzzled worried look in her eyes deaf to all this riot of warmth and flitting desire was playing Patienceplaying Patience as if Dionysius and her curate had died together
A faint buzz above the ceiling witnessed that petrography too was active
Gray and tranquil world
Amazing passionless world
A world in which days without meaning days in which we dont want things to happen followed days without meaninguntil the last thing happened the ultimate unavoidable coarse disagreeable
It was her last evening in that wrappered life against which she had rebelled
Warm reality was now so near her she could hear it beating in her ears
Away in London even now Capes was packing and preparing Capes the magic man whose touch turned one to trembling fire
What was he doing
What was he thinking
It was less than a day now less than twenty hours
Seventeen hours sixteen hours
She glanced at the softticking clock with the exposed brass pendulum upon the white marble mantel and made a rapid calculation
To be exact it was just sixteen hours and twenty minutes
The slow stars circled on to the moment of their meeting
The softly glittering summer stars
She saw them shining over mountains of snow over valleys of haze and warm darkness



There would be no moon
I believe after all its coming out
said Miss Stanley
The aces made it easy
Ann Veronica started from her reverie sat up in her chair became attentive
Look dear she said presently you can put the ten on the Jack
CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH IN THE MOUNTAINS Part 1 Next day Ann Veronica and Capes felt like newborn things
It seemed to them they could never have been really alive before but only dimly anticipating existence
They sat face to face beneath an experiencedlooking rucksack and a brand new portmanteau and a leather handbag in the afternoonboat train that goes from Charing Cross to Folkestone for Boulogne
They tried to read illustrated papers in an unconcerned manner and with forced attention lest they should catch the leaping exultation in each others eyes
And they admired Kent sedulously from the windows
They crossed the Channel in sunshine and a breeze that just ruffled the sea to glittering scales of silver
Some of the people who watched them standing side by side thought they must be newly wedded because of their happy faces and others that they were an oldestablished couple because of their easy confidence in each other
At Boulogne they took train to Basle next morning they breakfasted together in the buffet of that station and thence they caught the Interlaken express and so went by way of Spies to Frutigen
There was no railway beyond Frutigen in those days they sent their baggage by post to Kandersteg and walked along the mule path to the left of the stream to that queer hollow among the precipices Blau See where the petrifying branches of trees lie in the blue deeps of an icy lake and pinetrees clamber among gigantic boulders
A little inn flying a Swiss flag nestles under a great rock and there they put aside their knapsacks and lunched and rested in the midday shadow of the gorge and the scent of resin
And later they paddled in a boat above the mysterious deeps of the See and peered down into the greenblues and the bluegreens together
By that time it seemed to them they had lived together twenty years
Except for one memorable school excursion to Paris Ann Veronica had never yet been outside England
So that it seemed to her the whole world had changedthe very light of it had changed
Instead of English villas and cottages there were chalets and Italianbuilt houses shining white there were lakes of emerald and sapphire and clustering castles and such sweeps of hill and mountain such shining uplands of snow as she had never seen before
Everything was fresh and bright from the kindly manners of the Frutigen cobbler who hammered mountain nails into her boots to the unfamiliar wild flowers that spangled the wayside
And Capes had changed into the easiest and jolliest companion in the world
The mere fact that he was there in the train alongside her helping her sitting opposite to her in the diningcar presently sleeping on a seat within a yard of her made her heart sing until she was afraid their fellow passengers would hear it
It was too good to be true
She would not sleep for fear of losing a moment of that sense of his proximity
To walk beside him dressed akin to him rucksacked and companionable was bliss in itself each step she took was like stepping once more across the threshold of heaven
One trouble however shot its slanting bolts athwart the shining warmth of that opening day and marred its perfection and that was the thought of her father
She had treated him badly she had hurt him and her aunt she had done wrong by their standards and she would never persuade them that she had done right
She thought of her father in the garden and of her aunt with her Patience as she had seen themhow many ages was it ago
Just one day intervened
She felt as if she had struck them unawares
The thought of them distressed her without subtracting at all from the oceans of happiness in which she swam
But she wished she could put the thing she had done in some way to them so that it would not hurt them so much as the truth would certainly do
The thought of their faces and particularly of her aunts as it would meet the fact disconcerted unfriendly condemning painedoccurred to her again and again
Oh
I wish she said that people thought alike about these things
Capes watched the limpid water dripping from his oar
I wish they did he said but they dont
I feel All this is the rightest of all conceivable things
I want to tell every one
I want to boast myself
I know
I told them a lie
I told them lies
I wrote three letters yesterday and tore them up
It was so hopeless to put it to them
At lastI told a story
You didnt tell them our position
I implied we had married
Theyll find out
Theyll know
Not yet
Sooner or later
Possiblybit by bit



But it was hopelessly hard to put
I said I knew he disliked and distrusted you and your workthat you shared all Russells opinions he hates Russell beyond measureand that we couldnt possibly face a conventional marriage
What else could one say
I left him to supposea registry perhaps



Capes let his oar smack on the water
Do you mind very much
He shook his head
But it makes me feel inhuman he added
And me



Its the perpetual trouble he said of parent and child
They cant help seeing things in the way they do
Nor can we
WE dont think theyre right but they dont think we are
A deadlock
In a very definite sense we are in the wronghopelessly in the wrong
ButIts just this who was to be hurt
I wish no one had to be hurt said Ann Veronica
When one is happyI dont like to think of them
Last time I left home I felt as hard as nails
But this is all different
It is different
Theres a sort of instinct of rebellion said Capes
It isnt anything to do with our times particularly
People think it is but they are wrong
Its to do with adolescence
Long before religion and Society heard of Doubt girls were all for midnight coaches and Gretna Green
Its a sort of homeleaving instinct
He followed up a line of thought
Theres another instinct too he went on in a state of suppression unless Im very much mistaken a childexpelling instinct



I wonder



Theres no family uniting instinct anyhow its habit and sentiment and material convenience hold families together after adolescence
Theres always friction conflict unwilling concessions
Always
I dont believe there is any strong natural affection at all between parents and growingup children
There wasnt I know between myself and my father
I didnt allow myself to see things as they were in those days now I do
I bored him
I hated him
I suppose that shocks ones ideas



Its true



There are sentimental and traditional deferences and reverences I know between father and son but thats just exactly what prevents the development of an easy friendship
Fatherworshipping sons are abnormaland theyre no good
No good at all
Ones got to be a better man than ones father or what is the good of successive generations
Life is rebellion or nothing
He rowed a stroke and watched the swirl of water from his oar broaden and die away
At last he took up his thoughts again I wonder if some day one wont need to rebel against customs and laws
If this discord will have gone
Some day perhapswho knowsthe old wont coddle and hamper the young and the young wont need to fly in the faces of the old
Theyll face facts as facts and understand
Oh to face facts
Gods
what a world it might be if people faced facts
Understanding
Understanding
There is no other salvation
Some day older people perhaps will trouble to understand younger people and there wont be these fierce disruptions there wont be barriers one must defy or perish



Thats really our choice now defyor futility



The world perhaps will be educated out of its idea of fixed standards



I wonder Ann Veronica if when our time comes we shall be any wiser
Ann Veronica watched a waterbeetle fussing across the green depths
One cant tell
Im a female thing at bottom
I like high tone for a flourish and stars and ideas but I want my things
Part 2 Capes thought
Its oddI have no doubt in my mind that what we are doing is wrong he said
And yet I do it without compunction
I never felt so absolutely right said Ann Veronica
You ARE a female thing at bottom he admitted
Im not nearly so sure as you
As for me I look twice at it



Life is two things thats how I see it two things mixed and muddled up together
Life is moralitylife is adventure
Squire and master
Adventure rules and moralitylooks up the trains in the Bradshaw
Morality tells you what is right and adventure moves you
If morality means anything it means keeping bounds respecting implications respecting implicit bounds
If individuality means anything it means breaking boundsadventure
Will you be moral and your species or immoral and yourself
Weve decided to be immoral
We neednt try and give ourselves airs
Weve deserted the posts in which we found ourselves cut our duties exposed ourselves to risks that may destroy any sort of social usefulness in us



I dont know
One keeps rules in order to be ones self
One studies Nature in order not to be blindly ruled by her
Theres no sense in morality I suppose unless you are fundamentally immoral
She watched his face as he traced his way through these speculative thickets
Look at our affair he went on looking up at her
No power on earth will persuade me were not two rather disreputable persons
You desert your home I throw up useful teaching risk every hope in your career
Here we are absconding pretending to be what we are not shady to say the least of it
Its not a bit of good pretending theres any Higher Truth or wonderful principle in this business
There isnt
We never started out in any highbrowed manner to scandalize and Shelleyfy
When first you left your home you had no idea that I was the hidden impulse
I wasnt
You came out like an ant for your nuptial flight
It was just a chance that we in particular hit against each othernothing predestined about it
We just hit against each other and here we are flying off at a tangent a little surprised at what we are doing all our principles abandoned and tremendously and quite unreasonably proud of ourselves
Out of all this we have struck a sort of harmony



And its gorgeous
Glorious
said Ann Veronica
Would YOU like usif some one told you the bare outline of our storyand what we are doing
I shouldnt mind said Ann Veronica
But if some one else asked your advice
If some one else said Here is my teacher a jaded married man on the verge of middle age and he and I have a violent passion for one another
We propose to disregard all our ties all our obligations all the established prohibitions of society and begin life together afresh
What would you tell her
If she asked advice I should say she wasnt fit to do anything of the sort
I should say that having a doubt was enough to condemn it
But waive that point
It would be different all the same
It wouldnt be you
It wouldnt be you either
I suppose thats the gist of the whole thing
He stared at a little eddy
The rules all right so long as there isnt a case
Rules are for established things like the pieces and positions of a game
Men and women are not established things theyre experiments all of them
Every human being is a new thing exists to do new things
Find the thing you want to do most intensely make sure thats it and do it with all your might
If you live well and good if you die well and good
Your purpose is done



Well this is OUR thing
He woke the glassy water to swirling activity again and made the deepblue shapes below writhe and shiver
This is MY thing said Ann Veronica softly with thoughtful eyes upon him
Then she looked up the sweep of pinetrees to the towering sunlit cliffs and the high heaven above and then back to his face
She drew in a deep breath of the sweet mountain air
Her eyes were soft and grave and there was the faintest of smiles upon her resolute lips
Part 3 Later they loitered along a winding path above the inn and made love to one another
Their journey had made them indolent the afternoon was warm and it seemed impossible to breathe a sweeter air
The flowers and turf a wild strawberry a rare butterfly and suchlike little intimate things had become more interesting than mountains
Their flitting hands were always touching
Deep silences came between them



I had thought to go on to Kandersteg said Capes but this is a pleasant place
There is not a soul in the inn but ourselves
Let us stay the night here
Then we can loiter and gossip to our hearts content
Agreed said Ann Veronica
After all its our honeymoon
All we shall get said Ann Veronica
This place is very beautiful
Any place would be beautiful said Ann Veronica in a low voice
For a time they walked in silence
I wonder she began presently why I love you and love you so much



I know now what it is to be an abandoned female
I AM an abandoned female
Im not ashamedof the things Im doing
I want to put myself into your hands
You knowI wish I could roll my little body up small and squeeze it into your hand and grip your fingers upon it
Tight
I want you to hold me and have me SO



Everything
Everything
Its a pure joy of givinggiving to YOU
I have never spoken of these things to any human being
Just dreamedand ran away even from my dreams
It is as if my lips had been sealed about them
And now I break the sealsfor you
Only I wishI wish today I was a thousand times ten thousand times more beautiful
Capes lifted her hand and kissed it
You are a thousand times more beautiful he said than anything else could be



You are you
You are all the beauty in the world
Beauty doesnt mean never has meant anythinganything at all but you
It heralded you promised you



Part 4 They lay side by side in a shallow nest of turf and mosses among bowlders and stunted bushes on a high rock and watched the day sky deepen to evening between the vast precipices overhead and looked over the treetops down the widening gorge
A distant suggestion of chalets and a glimpse of the road set them talking for a time of the world they had left behind
Capes spoke casually of their plans for work
Its a flabby loosewilled world we have to face
It wont even know whether to be scandalized at us or forgiving
It will hold aloof a little undecided whether to pelt or not That depends whether we carry ourselves as though we expected pelting said Ann Veronica
We wont
No fear
Then as we succeed it will begin to sidle back to us
It will do its best to overlook things If we let it poor dear
Thats if we succeed
If we fail said Capes then We arent going to fail said Ann Veronica
Life seemed a very brave and glorious enterprise to Ann Veronica that day
She was quivering with the sense of Capes at her side and glowing with heroic love it seemed to her that if they put their hands jointly against the Alps and pushed they would be able to push them aside
She lay and nibbled at a sprig of dwarf rhododendron
FAIL
she said
Part 5 Presently it occurred to Ann Veronica to ask about the journey he had planned
He had his sections of the Siegfried map folded in his pocket and he squatted up with his legs crossed like an Indian idol while she lay prone beside him and followed every movement of his indicatory finger
Here he said is this Blau See and here we rest until tomorrow
I think we rest here until tomorrow
There was a brief silence
It is a very pleasant place said Ann Veronica biting a rhododendron stalk through and with that faint shadow of a smile returning to her lips



And then
said Ann Veronica
Then we go on to this place the Oeschinensee
Its a lake among precipices and there is a little inn where we can stay and sit and eat our dinner at a pleasant table that looks upon the lake
For some days we shall be very idle there among the trees and rocks
There are boats on the lake and shady depths and wildernesses of pinewood
After a day or so perhaps we will go on one or two little excursions and see how good your head isa mild scramble or so and then up to a hut on a pass just here and out upon the Blumlisalp glacier that spreads out so and so
She roused herself from some dream at the word
Glaciers
she said
Under the Wilde Frauwhich was named after you
He bent and kissed her hair and paused and then forced his attention back to the map
One day he resumed we will start off early and come down into Kandersteg and up these zigzags and here and here and so past this Daubensee to a tiny innit wont be busy yet though we may get it all to ourselveson the brim of the steepest zigzag you can imagine thousands of feet of zigzag and you will sit and eat lunch with me and look out across the Rhone Valley and over blue distances beyond blue distances to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and a long regiment of sunny snowy mountains
And when we see them we shall at once want to go to themthats the way with beautiful thingsand down we shall go like flies down a wall to Leukerbad and so to Leuk Station here and then by train up the Rhone Valley and this little side valley to Stalden and there in the cool of the afternoon we shall start off up a gorge torrents and cliffs below us and above us to sleep in a halfway inn and go on next day to Saas Fee Saas of the Magic Saas of the Pagan People
And there about Saas are ice and snows again and sometimes we will loiter among the rocks and trees about Saas or peep into Samuel Butlers chapels and sometimes we will climb up out of the way of the other people on to the glaciers and snow
And for one expedition at least we will go up this desolate valley here to Mattmark and so on to Monte Moro
There indeed you see Monte Rosa
Almost the best of all
Is it very beautiful
When I saw it there it was very beautiful
It was wonderful
It was the crowned queen of mountains in her robes of shining white
It towered up high above the level of the pass thousands of feet still shining and white and below thousands of feet below was a floor of little woolly clouds
And then presently these clouds began to wear thin and expose steep deep slopes going down and down with grass and pinetrees down and down and at last through a great rent in the clouds bare roofs shining like very minute pinheads and a road like a fibre of white silkMacugnana in Italy
That will be a fine dayit will have to be when first you set eyes on Italy



Thats as far as we go
Cant we go down into Italy
No he said it wont run to that now
We must wave our hands at the blue hills far away there and go back to London and work
But Italy Italys for a good girl he said and laid his hand for a moment on her shoulder
She must look forward to Italy
I say she reflected you ARE rather the master you know
The idea struck him as novel
Of course Im manager for this expedition he said after an interval of selfexamination
She slid her cheek down the tweed sleeve of his coat
Nice sleeve she said and came to his hand and kissed it
I say
he cried
Look here
Arent you going a little too far
Thisthis is degradationmaking a fuss with sleeves
You mustnt do things like that
Why not
Free womanand equal
I do itof my own free will said Ann Veronica kissing his hand again
Its nothing to what I WILL do
Oh well
he said a little doubtfully its just a phase and bent down and rested his hand on her shoulder for a moment with his heart beating and his nerves aquiver
Then as she lay very still with her hands clinched and her black hair tumbled about her face he came still closer and softly kissed the nape of her neck



Part 6 Most of the things that he had planned they did
But they climbed more than he had intended because Ann Veronica proved rather a good climber steadyheaded and plucky rather daring but quite willing to be cautious at his command
One of the things that most surprised him in her was her capacity for blind obedience
She loved to be told to do things
He knew the circle of mountains about Saas Fee fairly well he had been there twice before and it was fine to get away from the straggling pedestrians into the high lonely places and sit and munch sandwiches and talk together and do things together that were just a little difficult and dangerous
And they could talk they found and never once it seemed did their meaning and intention hitch
They were enormously pleased with one another they found each other beyond measure better than they had expected if only because of the want of substance in mere expectation
Their conversation degenerated again and again into a strain of selfcongratulation that would have irked an eavesdropper
YoureI dont know said Ann Veronica
Youre splendid
It isnt that youre splendid or I said Capes
But we satisfy one another
Heaven alone knows why
So completely
The oddest fitness
What is it made of
Texture of skin and texture of mind
Complexion and voice
I dont think Ive got illusions nor you



If I had never met anything of you at all but a scrap of your skin binding a book Ann Veronica I know I would have kept that somewhere near to me



All your faults are just jolly modelling to make you real and solid
The faults are the best part of it said Ann Veronica why even our little vicious strains run the same way
Even our coarseness
Coarse
said Capes Were not coarse
But if we were
said Ann Veronica
I can talk to you and you to me without a scrap of effort said Capes thats the essence of it
Its made up of things as small as the diameter of hairs and big as life and death



One always dreamed of this and never believed it
Its the rarest luck the wildest most impossible accident
Most people every one I know else seem to have mated with foreigners and to talk uneasily in unfamiliar tongues to be afraid of the knowledge the other one has of the other ones perpetual misjudgment and misunderstandings
Why dont they wait
he added
Ann Veronica had one of her flashes of insight
One doesnt wait said Ann Veronica
She expanded that
I shouldnt have waited she said
I might have muddled for a time
But its as you say
Ive had the rarest luck and fallen on my feet
Weve both fallen on our feet
Were the rarest of mortals
The real thing
Theres not a compromise nor a sham nor a concession between us
We arent afraid we dont bother
We dont consider each other we neednt
That wrappered life as you call itweve burned the confounded rags
Danced out of it
Were stark
Stark
echoed Ann Veronica
Part 7 As they came back from that days climbit was up the Mittaghornthey had to cross a shining space of wet steep rocks between two grass slopes that needed a little care
There were a few loose broken fragments of rock to reckon with upon the ledges and one place where hands did as much work as toes
They used the ropenot that a rope was at all necessary but because Ann Veronicas exalted state of mind made the fact of the rope agreeably symbolical and anyhow it did insure a joint death in the event of some remotely possibly mischance
Capes went first finding footholds and where the drops in the strataedges came like long awkward steps placing Ann Veronicas feet
About halfway across this interval when everything seemed going well Capes had a shock
Heavens
exclaimed Ann Veronica with extraordinary passion
My God
and ceased to move
Capes became rigid and adhesive
Nothing ensued
All right
he asked
Ill have to pay it
Eh
Ive forgotten something
Oh cuss it
Eh
He said I would
What
Thats the devil of it
Devil of what



You DO use vile language
Forget about it like this
Forget WHAT
And I said I wouldnt
I said Id do anything
I said Id make shirts
Shirts
Shirts at oneandsomething a dozen
Oh goodness
Bilking
Ann Veronica youre a bilker
Pause
Will you tell me what all this is about
said Capes
Its about forty pounds
Capes waited patiently
G Im sorry



But youve got to lend me forty pounds
Its some sort of delirium said Capes
The rarefied air
I thought you had a better head
No
Ill explain lower
Its all right
Lets go on climbing now
Its a thing Ive unaccountably overlooked
All right really
It can wait a bit longer
I borrowed forty pounds from Mr Ramage
Thank goodness youll understand
Thats why I chucked Manning



All right Im coming
But all this business has driven it clean out of my head



Thats why he was so annoyed you know
Who was annoyed
Mr Ramageabout the forty pounds
She took a step
My dear she added by way of afterthought you DO obliterate things
Part 8 They found themselves next day talking love to one another high up on some rocks above a steep bank of snow that overhung a precipice on the eastern side of the Fee glacier
By this time Capes hair had bleached nearly white and his skin had become a skin of red copper shot with gold
They were now both in a state of unprecedented physical fitness
And such skirts as Ann Veronica had had when she entered the valley of Saas were safely packed away in the hotel and she wore a leather belt and loose knickerbockers and putteesa costume that suited the fine long lines of her limbs far better than any feminine walkingdress could do
Her complexion had resisted the snowglare wonderfully her skin had only deepened its natural warmth a little under the Alpine sun
She had pushed aside her azure veil taken off her snowglasses and sat smiling under her hand at the shining gloriesthe lit cornices the blue shadows the softly rounded enormous snow masses the deep places full of quivering luminosityof the Taschhorn and Dom
The sky was cloudless effulgent blue
Capes sat watching and admiring her and then he fell praising the day and fortune and their love for each other
Here we are he said shining through each other like light through a stainedglass window
With this air in our blood this sunlight soaking us



Life is so good
Can it ever be so good again
Ann Veronica put out a firm hand and squeezed his arm
Its very good she said
Its glorious good
Suppose nowlook at this long snowslope and then that blue deep beyonddo you see that round pool of color in the icea thousand feet or more below
Yes
Well thinkweve got to go but ten steps and lie down and put our arms about each other
See
Down we should rush in a foamin a cloud of snowto flight and a dream
All the rest of our lives would be together then Ann Veronica
Every moment
And no illchances
If you tempt me too much  she said after a silence I shall do it
I need only just jump up and throw myself upon you
Im a desperate young woman
And then as we went down youd try to explain
And that would spoil it



You know you dont mean it
No I dont
But I liked to say it
Rather
But I wonder why you dont mean it
Because I suppose the other thing is better
What other reason could there be
Its more complex but its better
THIS this glissade would be damned scoundrelism
You know that and I know that though we might be put to it to find a reason why
It would be swindling
Drawing the pay of life and then not living
And besidesWere going to live Ann Veronica
Oh the things well do the life well lead
Therell be trouble in it at timesyou and I arent going to run without friction
But weve got the brains to get over that and tongues in our heads to talk to each other
We shant hang up on any misunderstanding
Not us
And were going to fight that old world down there
That old world that had shoved up that silly old hotel and all the rest of it



If we dont live it will think we are afraid of it



Die indeed
Were going to do work were going to unfold about each other were going to have children
Girls
cried Ann Veronica
Boys
said Capes
Both
said Ann Veronica
Lots of em
Capes chuckled
You delicate female
Who cares said Ann Veronica seeing its you
Warm soft little wonders
Of course I want them
Part 9 All sorts of things were going to do said Capes all sorts of times were going to have
Sooner or later well certainly do something to clean those prisons you told me aboutlimewash the underside of life
You and I
We can love on a snow cornice we can love over a pail of whitewash
Love anywhere
Anywhere
Moonlight and musicpleasing you know but quite unnecessary
We met dissecting dogfish



Do you remember your first day with me



Do you indeed remember
The smell of decay and cheap methylated spirit



My dear
weve had so many moments
I used to go over the times wed had together the things wed saidlike a rosary of beads
But now its beads by the casklike the hold of a West African trader
It feels like too much golddust clutched in ones hand
One doesnt want to lose a grain
And one mustsome of it must slip through ones fingers
I dont care if it does said Ann Veronica
I dont care a rap for remembering
I care for you
This moment couldnt be better until the next moment comes
Thats how it takes me
Why should WE hoard
We arent going out presently like Japanese lanterns in a gale
Its the poor dears who do who know they will know they cant keep it up who need to clutch at wayside flowers
And put em in little books for remembrance
Flattened flowers arent for the likes of us
Moments indeed
We like each other fresh and fresh
It isnt illusionsfor us
We two just love each other the real identical otherall the time
The real identical other said Capes and took and bit the tip of her little finger
Theres no delusions so far as I know said Ann Veronica
I dont believe there is one
If there is its a mere wrappingtheres better underneath
Its only as if Id begun to know you the day before yesterday or thereabouts
You keep on coming truer after you have seemed to come altogether true
You



brick
Part 10 To think he cried you are ten years younger than I



There are times when you make me feel a little thing at your feeta young silly protected thing
Do you know Ann Veronica it is all a lie about your birth certificate a forgeryand fooling at that
You are one of the Immortals
Immortal
You were in the beginning and all the men in the world who have known what love is have worshipped at your feet
You have converted me toLester Ward
You are my dear friend you are a slip of a girl but there are moments when my head has been on your breast when your heart has been beating close to my ears when I have known you for the goddess when I have wished myself your slave when I have wished that you could kill me for the joy of being killed by you
You are the High Priestess of Life



Your priestess whispered Ann Veronica softly
A silly little priestess who knew nothing of life at all until she came to you
Part 11 They sat for a time without speaking a word in an enormous shining globe of mutual satisfaction
Well said Capes at length weve to go down Ann Veronica
Life waits for us
He stood up and waited for her to move
Gods
cried Ann Veronica and kept him standing
And to think that its not a full year ago since I was a blackhearted rebel schoolgirl distressed puzzled perplexed not understanding that this great force of love was bursting its way through me
All those nameless discontentsthey were no more than loves birthpangs
I feltI felt living in a masked world
I felt as though I had bandaged eyes
I feltwrapped in thick cobwebs
They blinded me
They got in my mouth
And nowDear
Dear
The dayspring from on high hath visited me
I love
I am loved
I want to shout
I want to sing
I am glad
I am glad to be alive because you are alive
I am glad to be a woman because you are a man
I am glad
I am glad
I am glad
I thank God for life and you
I thank God for His sunlight on your face
I thank God for the beauty you love and the faults you love
I thank God for the very skin that is peeling from your nose for all things great and small that make us what we are
This is grace I am saying
Oh
my dear
all the joy and weeping of life are mixed in me now and all the gratitude
Never a newborn dragonfly that spread its wings in the morning has felt as glad as I
CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH IN PERSPECTIVE Part 1 About four years and a quarter laterto be exact it was four years and four monthsMr and Mrs Capes stood side by side upon an old Persian carpet that did duty as a hearthrug in the diningroom of their flat and surveyed a shining dinnertable set for four people lit by skilfullyshaded electric lights brightened by frequent gleams of silver and carefully and simply adorned with sweetpea blossom
Capes had altered scarcely at all during the interval except for a new quality of smartness in the cut of his clothes but Ann Veronica was nearly half an inch taller her face was at once stronger and softer her neck firmer and rounder and her carriage definitely more womanly than it had been in the days of her rebellion
She was a woman now to the tips of her fingers she had said goodbye to her girlhood in the old garden four years and a quarter ago
She was dressed in a simple evening gown of soft creamy silk with a yoke of dark old embroidery that enhanced the gentle gravity of her style and her black hair flowed off her open forehead to pass under the control of a simple ribbon of silver
A silver necklace enhanced the dusky beauty of her neck
Both husband and wife affected an unnatural ease of manner for the benefit of the efficient parlormaid who was putting the finishing touches to the sideboard arrangements
It looks all right said Capes
I think everythings right said Ann Veronica with the roaming eye of a capable but not devoted housemistress
I wonder if they will seem altered she remarked for the third time
There I cant help said Capes
He walked through a wide open archway curtained with deepblue curtains into the apartment that served as a receptionroom
Ann Veronica after a last survey of the dinner appointments followed him rustling came to his side by the high brass fender and touched two or three ornaments on the mantel above the cheerful fireplace
Its still a marvel to me that we are to be forgiven she said turning
My charm of manner I suppose
But indeed hes very human
Did you tell him of the registry office
Noocertainly not so emphatically as I did about the play
It was an inspirationyour speaking to him
I felt impudent
I believe I am getting impudent
I had not been near the Royal Society sincesince you disgraced me
Whats that
They both stood listening
It was not the arrival of the guests but merely the maid moving about in the hall
Wonderful man
said Ann Veronica reassured and stroking his cheek with her finger
Capes made a quick movement as if to bite that aggressive digit but it withdrew to Ann Veronicas side
I was really interested in his stuff
I WAS talking to him before I saw his name on the card beside the row of microscopes
Then naturally I went on talking
Hehe has rather a poor opinion of his contemporaries
Of course he had no idea who I was
But how did you tell him
Youve never told me
Wasnt ita little bit of a scene
Oh
let me see
I said I hadnt been at the Royal Society soiree for four years and got him to tell me about some of the fresh Mendelian work
He loves the Mendelians because he hates all the big names of the eighties and nineties
Then I think I remarked that science was disgracefully underendowed and confessed Id had to take to more profitable courses
The fact of it is I said Im the new playwright Thomas More
Perhaps youve heard
Well you know he had
Fame
Isnt it
Ive not seen your play Mr More he said but Im told its the most amusing thing in London at the present time
A friend of mine OgilvyI suppose thats Ogilvy  Ogilvy who do so many divorces Veewas speaking very highly of itvery highly
 He smiled into her eyes
You are developing far too retentive a memory for praises said Ann Veronica
Im still new to them
But after that it was easy
I told him instantly and shamelessly that the play was going to be worth ten thousand pounds
He agreed it was disgraceful
Then I assumed a rather portentous manner to prepare him
How
Show me
I cant be portentous dear when youre about
Its my other side of the moon
But I was portentous I can assure you
My names NOT More Mr Stanley I said
Thats my pet name
 Yes
I thinkyes I went on in a pleasing blend of the casual and sotto voce The fact of it is sir I happen to be your soninlaw Capes
I do wish you could come and dine with us some evening
It would make my wife very happy
 What did he say
What does any one say to an invitation to dinner pointblank
One tries to collect ones wits
She is constantly thinking of you I said
And he accepted meekly
Practically
What else could he do
You cant kick up a scene on the spur of the moment in the face of such conflicting values as he had before him
With me behaving as if everything was infinitely matteroffact what could he do
And just then Heaven sent old ManningtreeI didnt tell you before of the fortunate intervention of Manningtree did I
He was looking quite infernally distinguished with a wide crimson ribbon across himwhat IS a wide crimson ribbon
Some sort of knight I suppose
He is a knight
Well young man he said we havent seen you lately and something about Bateson  Cohes frightfully antiMendelianhaving it all their own way
So I introduced him to my fatherinlaw like a shot
I think that WAS decision
Yes it was Manningtree really secured your father
He Here they are
said Ann Veronica as the bell sounded
Part 2 They received the guests in their pretty little hall with genuine effusion
Miss Stanley threw aside a black cloak to reveal a discreet and dignified arrangement of brown silk and then embraced Ann Veronica with warmth
So very clear and cold she said
I feared we might have a fog
The housemaids presence acted as a useful restraint
Ann Veronica passed from her aunt to her father and put her arms about him and kissed his cheek
Dear old daddy
she said and was amazed to find herself shedding tears
She veiled her emotion by taking off his overcoat
And this is Mr
Capes
she heard her aunt saying
All four people moved a little nervously into the drawingroom maintaining a sort of fluttered amiability of sound and movement
Mr Stanley professed a great solicitude to warm his hands
Quite unusually cold for the time of year he said
Everything very nice I am sure Miss Stanley murmured to Capes as he steered her to a place upon the little sofa before the fire
Also she made little pussylike sounds of a reassuring nature
And lets have a look at you Vee
said Mr Stanley standing up with a sudden geniality and rubbing his hands together
Ann Veronica who knew her dress became her dropped a curtsy to her fathers regard
Happily they had no one else to wait for and it heartened her mightily to think that she had ordered the promptest possible service of the dinner
Capes stood beside Miss Stanley who was beaming unnaturally and Mr Stanley in his effort to seem at ease took entire possession of the hearthrug
You found the flat easily
said Capes in the pause
The numbers are a little difficult to see in the archway
They ought to put a lamp
Her father declared there had been no difficulty
Dinner is served mm said the efficient parlormaid in the archway and the worst was over
Come daddy said Ann Veronica following her husband and Miss Stanley and in the fulness of her heart she gave a friendly squeeze to the parental arm
Excellent fellow
he answered a little irrelevantly
I didnt understand Vee
Quite charming apartments Miss Stanley admired charming
Everything is so pretty and convenient
The dinner was admirable as a dinner nothing went wrong from the golden and excellent clear soup to the delightful iced marrons and cream and Miss Stanleys praises died away to an appreciative acquiescence
A brisk talk sprang up between Capes and Mr Stanley to which the two ladies subordinated themselves intelligently
The burning topic of the Mendelian controversy was approached on one or two occasions but avoided dexterously and they talked chiefly of letters and art and the censorship of the English stage
Mr Stanley was inclined to think the censorship should be extended to the supply of what he styled latterday fiction good wholesome stories were being ousted he said by vicious corrupting stuff that left a bad taste in the mouth
He declared that no book could be satisfactory that left a bad taste in the mouth however much it seized and interested the reader at the time
He did not like it he said with a significant look to be reminded of either his books or his dinners after he had done with them
Capes agreed with the utmost cordiality
Life is upsetting enough without the novels taking a share said Mr Stanley
For a time Ann Veronicas attention was diverted by her aunts interest in the salted almonds
Quite particularly nice said her aunt
Exceptionally so
When Ann Veronica could attend again she found the men were discussing the ethics of the depreciation of house property through the increasing tumult of traffic in the West End and agreeing with each other to a devastating extent
It came into her head with real emotional force that this must be some particularly fantastic sort of dream
It seemed to her that her father was in some inexplicable way meanerlooking than she had supposed and yet also as unaccountably appealing
His tie had demanded a struggle he ought to have taken a clean one after his first failure
Why was she noting things like this
Capes seemed selfpossessed and elaborately genial and commonplace but she knew him to be nervous by a little occasional clumsiness by the faintest shadow of vulgarity in the urgency of his hospitality
She wished he could smoke and dull his nerves a little
A gust of irrational impatience blew through her being
Well theyd got to the pheasants and in a little while he would smoke
What was it she had expected
Surely her moods were getting a little out of hand
She wished her father and aunt would not enjoy their dinner with such quiet determination
Her father and her husband who had both been a little pale at their first encounter were growing now just faintly flushed
It was a pity people had to eat food
I suppose said her father I have read at least half the novels that have been at all successful during the last twenty years
Three a week is my allowance and if I get short ones four
I change them in the morning at Cannon Street and take my book as I come down
It occurred to her that she had never seen her father dining out before never watched him critically as an equal
To Capes he was almost deferential and she had never seen him deferential in the old time never
The dinner was stranger than she had ever anticipated
It was as if she had grown right past her father into something older and of infinitely wider outlook as if he had always been unsuspectedly a flattened figure and now she had discovered him from the other side
It was a great relief to arrive at last at that pause when she could say to her aunt Now dear
and rise and hold back the curtain through the archway
Capes and her father stood up and her father made a belated movement toward the curtain
She realized that he was the sort of man one does not think much about at dinners
And Capes was thinking that his wife was a supremely beautiful woman
He reached a silver cigar and cigarette box from the sideboard and put it before his fatherinlaw and for a time the preliminaries of smoking occupied them both
Then Capes flittered to the hearthrug and poked the fire stood up and turned about
Ann Veronica is looking very well dont you think
he said a little awkwardly
Very said Mr Stanley
Very and cracked a walnut appreciatively
LifethingsI dont think her prospects nowHopeful outlook
You were in a difficult position Mr Stanley pronounced and seemed to hesitate whether he had not gone too far
He looked at his port wine as though that tawny ruby contained the solution of the matter
Alls well that ends well he said and the less one says about things the better
Of course said Capes and threw a newly lit cigar into the fire through sheer nervousness
Have some more port wine sir
Its a very sound wine said Mr Stanley consenting with dignity
Ann Veronica has never looked quite so well I think said Capes clinging because of a preconceived plan to the suppressed topic
Part 3 At last the evening was over and Capes and his wife had gone down to see Mr Stanley and his sister into a taxicab and had waved an amiable farewell from the pavement steps
Great dears
said Capes as the vehicle passed out of sight
Yes arent they
said Ann Veronica after a thoughtful pause
And then They seem changed
Come in out of the cold said Capes and took her arm
They seem smaller you know even physically smaller she said
Youve grown out of them



Your aunt liked the pheasant
She liked everything
Did you hear us through the archway talking cookery
They went up by the lift in silence
Its odd said Ann Veronica reentering the flat
Whats odd
Oh everything
She shivered and went to the fire and poked it
Capes sat down in the armchair beside her
Lifes so queer she said kneeling and looking into the flames
I wonderI wonder if we shall ever get like that
She turned a firelit face to her husband
Did you tell him
Capes smiled faintly
Yes
How
Wella little clumsily
But how
I poured him out some port wine and I saidlet me seeoh You are going to be a grandfather
 Yes
Was he pleased
Calmly
He saidyou wont mind my telling you
Not a bit
He said Poor Alice has got no end
 Alices are different said Ann Veronica after an interval
Quite different
She didnt choose her man



Well I told aunt



Husband of mine I think we have rather overrated the emotional capacity of thosethose dears
What did your aunt say
She didnt even kiss me
She saidAnn Veronica shivered again I hope it wont make you uncomfortable my dearlike thatand whatever you do do be careful of your hair
I thinkI judge from her mannerthat she thought it was just a little indelicate of usconsidering everything but she tried to be practical and sympathetic and live down to our standards
Capes looked at his wifes unsmiling face
Your father he said remarked that alls well that ends well and that he was disposed to let bygones be bygones
He then spoke with a certain fatherly kindliness of the past



And my heart has ached for him
Oh no doubt it cut him at the time
It must have cut him
We might even havegiven it up for them
I wonder if we could
I suppose all IS well that ends well
Somehow tonightI dont know
I suppose so
Im glad the old sore is assuaged
Very glad
But if we had gone under
They regarded one another silently and Ann Veronica had one of her penetrating flashes
We are not the sort that goes under said Ann Veronica holding her hands so that the red reflections vanished from her eyes
We settled long agowere hard stuff
Were hard stuff
Then she went on To think that is my father
Oh my dear
He stood over me like a cliff the thought of him nearly turned me aside from everything we have done
He was the social order he was law and wisdom
And they come here and they look at our furniture to see if it is good and they are not glad it does not stir them that at last at last we can dare to have children
She dropped back into a crouching attitude and began to weep
Oh my dear
she cried and suddenly flung herself kneeling into her husbands arms
Do you remember the mountains
Do you remember how we loved one another
How intensely we loved one another
Do you remember the light on things and the glory of things
Im greedy Im greedy
I want children like the mountains and life like the sky
Oh
and lovelove
Weve had so splendid a time and fought our fight and won
And its like the petals falling from a flower
Oh Ive loved love dear
Ive loved love and you and the glory of you and the great time is over and I have to go carefully and bear children andtake care of my hairand when I am done with that I shall be an old woman
The petals have fallen the red petals we loved so
Were hedged about with discretionsand all this furnitureand successes
We are successful at last
Successful
But the mountains dear
We wont forget the mountains dear ever
That shining slope of snow and how we talked of death
We might have died
Even when we are old when we are rich as we may be we wont forget the tune when we cared nothing for anything but the joy of one another when we risked everything for one another when all the wrappings and coverings seemed to have fallen from life and left it light and fire
Stark and stark
Do you remember it all



Say you will never forget
That these common things and secondary things shant overwhelm us
These petals
Ive been wanting to cry all the evening cry here on your shoulder for my petals
Petals



Silly woman



Ive never had these crying fits before



Blood of my heart
whispered Capes holding her close to him
I know
I understand
