Desert Gold D E S E R T G O L D PROLOGUE Chapter I A face haunted Camerona womans face
It was there in the white heart of the dying campfire it hung in the shadows that hovered over the flickering light it drifted in the darkness beyond
This hour when the day had closed and the lonely desert night set in with its dead silence was one in which Camerons mind was thronged with memories of a time long pastof a home back in Peoria of a woman he had wronged and lost and loved too late
He was a prospector for gold a hunter of solitude a lover of the drear rockribbed infinitude because he wanted to be alone to remember
A sound disturbed Camerons reflections
He bent his head listening
A soft wind fanned the paling embers blew sparks and white ashes and thin smoke away into the enshrouding circle of blackness
His burro did not appear to be moving about
The quiet split to the cry of a coyote
It rose strange wild mournfulnot the howl of a prowling upland beast baying the campfire or barking at a lonely prospector but the wail of a wolf fullvoiced crying out the meaning of the desert and the night
Hunger throbbed in ithunger for a mate for offspring for life
When it ceased the terrible desert silence smote Cameron and the cry echoed in his soul
He and that wandering wolf were brothers
Then a sharp clink of metal on stone and soft pads of hoofs in sand prompted Cameron to reach for his gun and to move out of the light of waning campfire
He was somewhere along the wild border line between Sonora and Arizona and the prospector who dared the heat and barrenness of that region risked other dangers sometimes as menacing
Figures darker than the gloom approached and took shape and in the light turned out to be those of a white man and a heavily packed burro
Hello there the man called as he came to a halt and gazed about him
I saw your fire
May I make camp here
Cameron came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor whom he took for a prospector like himself
Cameron resented the breaking of his lonely campfire vigil but he respected the law of the desert
The stranger thanked him and then slipped the pack from his burro
Then he rolled out his pack and began preparations for a meal
His movements were slow and methodical
Cameron watched him still with resentment yet with a curious and growing interest
The campfire burst into a bright blaze and by its light Cameron saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make him old and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression of rugged strength
Find any mineral
asked Cameron presently
His visitor looked up quickly as if startled by the sound of a human voice
He replied and then the two men talked a little
But the stranger evidently preferred silence
Cameron understood that
He laughed grimly and bent a keener gaze upon the furrowed shadowy face
Another of those strange desert prospectors in whom there was some relentless driving power besides the lust for gold
Cameron felt that between this man and himself there was a subtle affinity vague and undefined perhaps born of the divination that here was a desert wanderer like himself perhaps born of a deeper an unintelligible relation having its roots back in the past
A longforgotten sensation stirred in Camerons breast one so long forgotten that he could recognize it
But it was akin to pain
Chapter II When he awakened he found to his surprise that his companion had departed
A trail in the sand led off to the north
There was no water in that direction
Cameron shrugged his shoulders it was not his affair he had his own problems
And straightway he forgot his strange visitor
Cameron began his day grateful for the solitude that was now unbroken for the canyonfurrowed and cactusspired scene that now showed no sign of life
He traveled southwest never straying far from the dry stream bed and in a desultory way without eagerness he hunted for signs of gold
The work was toilsome yet the periods of rest in which he indulged were not taken because of fatigue
He rested to look to listen to feel
What the vast silent world meant to him had always been a mystical thing which he felt in all its incalculable power but never understood
That day while it was yet light and he was digging in a moist whitebordered wash for water he was brought sharply up by hearing the crack of hard hoofs on stone
There down the canyon came a man and a burro
Cameron recognized them
Hello friend called the man halting
Our trails crossed again
Thats good
Hello replied Cameron slowly
Any mineral sign today
No
They made camp together ate their frugal meal smoked a pipe and rolled in their blankets without exchanging many words
In the morning the same reticence the same aloofness characterized the manner of both
But Camerons companion when he had packed his burro and was ready to start faced about and said We might stay together if its all right with you
I never take a partner replied Cameron
Youre alone Im alone said the other mildly
Its a big place
If we find gold therell be enough for two
I dont go down into the desert for gold alone rejoined Cameron with a chill note in his swift reply
His companions deepset luminous eyes emitted a singular flash
It moved Cameron to say that in the years of his wandering he had meant no man who could endure equally with him the blasting heat the blinding dust storms the wilderness of sand and rock and lava and cactus the terrible silence and desolation of the desert
Cameron waved a hand toward the wide shimmering shadowy descent of plain and range
I may strike through the Sonora Desert
I may head for Pinacate or north for the Colorado Basin
You are an old man
I dont know the country but to me one place is the same as another replied his companion
for moments he seemed to forget himself and swept his farreaching gaze out over the colored gulf of stone and sand
Then with gentle slaps he drove his burro in behind Cameron
Yes Im old
Im lonely too
Its come to me just lately
but friend I can still travel and for a few days my company wont hurt you
Have it your way said Cameron
They began a slow march down into the desert
At sunset they camped under the lee of a low mesa
Cameron was glad his comrade had the Indian habit of silence
Another days travel found the prospectors deep in the wilderness
Then there came a breaking of reserve noticeable in the elder man almost imperceptibly gradual in Cameron
Beside the meager mesquite campfire this grayfaced thoughtful old prospector would remove his black pipe from his mouth to talk a little and Cameron would listen and sometimes unlock his lips to speak a word
And so as Cameron began to respond to the influence of a desert less lonely than habitual he began to take keener note of his comrade and found him different from any other he had ever encountered in the wilderness
This man never grumbled at the heat the glare the driving sand the sour water the scant fare
During the daylight hours he was seldom idle
At night he sat dreaming before the fire or paced to and fro in the gloom
He slept but little and that long after Cameron had had his own rest
He was tireless patient brooding
Camerons awakened interest brought home to him the realization that for years he had shunned companionship
In those years only three men had wandered into the desert with him and these had left their bones to bleach in the shifting sands
Cameron had not cared to know their secrets
But the more he studied this latest comrade the more he began to suspect that he might have missed something in the others
In his own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of silence and desolation where he could be alone with it he had forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men
Somehow this silent comrade reminded him
One afternoon late after than had toiled up a white winding wash of sand and gravel they came upon a dry waterhole
Cameron dug deep into the sand but without avail
He was turning to retrace weary steps back to the last water when his comrade asked him to wait
Cameron watched him search in his pack and bring forth what appeared to be a small forked branch of a peach tree
He grasped the prongs of the fork and held them before him with the end standing straight out and then he began to walk along the stream bed
Cameron at first amused then amazed then pitying and at last curious kept pace with the prospector
He saw a strong tension of his comrades wrists as if he was holding hard against a considerable force
The end of the peach branch began to quiver and turn
Cameron reached out a hand to touch it and was astounded at feeling a powerful vibrant force pulling the branch downward
He felt it as a magnetic shock
The branch kept turning and at length pointed to the ground
Dig here said the prospector
What
ejaculated Cameron
Had the man lost his mind
Then Cameron stood by while his comrade dug in the sand
Three feet he dugfourfive and the sand grew dark then moist
At six feet water began to seep through
Get the little basket in my pack he said
Cameron complied and saw his comrade drop the basket into the deep hole where it kept the sides from caving in and allowed the water to seep through
While Cameron watched the basket filled
Of all the strange incidents of his desert career this was the strangest
Curiously he picked up the peach branch and held it as he had seen it held
The thing however was dead in his hands
I see you havent got it remarked his comrade
Few men have
Got what
demanded Cameron
A power to find water that way
Back in Illinois an old German used to do that to locate wells
He showed me I had the same power
I cant explain
But you neednt look so dumfounded
Theres nothing supernatural about it
You mean its a simple factthat some men have a magnetism a force or power to find water as you did
Yes
Its not unusual on the farms back in Illinois Ohio Pennsylvania
The old German I spoke of made money traveling round with his peach fork
What a gift for a man in the desert
Camerons comrade smiledthe second time in all those days
They entered a region where mineral abounded and their march became slower
Generally they took the course of a wash one on each side and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the bleached blades of scant grass or at sage or cactus while they searched in the canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold
When they found any rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a chemical test
The search was fascinating
They interspersed the work with long restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains
Some impelling desire not all the lure of gold took them to the top of mesas and escarpments and here when they had dug and picked they rested and gazed out at the wide prospect
Then as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to dent its red disk behind fardistant spurs they halted in a shady canyon or likely spot in a dry wash and tried for water
When they found it they unpacked gave drink to the tired burros and turned them loose
Dead mesquite served for the campfire
While the strange twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones with eyes on the dying embers of the fire and soon they lay on the sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces
Each succeeding day and night Cameron felt himself more and more drawn to this strange man
He found that after hours of burning toil he had insensibly grown nearer to his comrade
He reflected that after a few weeks in the desert he had always become a different man
In civilization in the rough mining camps he had been a prey to unrest and gloom
but once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely world he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness
Did not the desert magnify men
Cameron believed that wild men in wild places fighting cold heat starvation thirst barrenness facing the elements in all their ferocity usually retrograded descended to the savage lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes
Likewise he believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed that brutal order of life and became noble wonderful superhuman
So now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man alone on the desert driven there by lifes mysterious and remorseless motive were to see each other through Gods eyes
His companion was one who thought of himself last
It humiliated Cameron that in spite of growing keenness he could not hinder him from doing more than an equal share of the days work
The man was mild gentle quiet mostly silent yet under all his softness he seemed to be mad of the fiber of steel
Cameron could not thwart him
Moreover he appeared to want to find gold for Cameron not for himself
Camerons hands always trembled at the turning of rock that promised gold he had enough of the prospectors passion for fortune to thrill at the chance of a strike
But the other never showed the least trace of excitement
One night they were encamped at the head of a canyon
They day had been exceedingly hot and long after sundown the radiation of heat from the rocks persisted
A desert bird whistled a wild melancholy note from a dark cliff and a distant coyote wailed mournfully
The stars shone white until the huge moon rose to burn out all their whiteness
And on this night Cameron watched his comrade and yielded to interest he had not heretofore voiced
Pardner what drives you into the desert
Do I seem to be a driven man
No
but I feel it
Do you come to forget
Yes
Ah
softly exclaimed Cameron
Always he seemed to have known that
He said no more
He watched the old man rise and begin his nightly pace to and fro up and down
With slow soft tread forward and back tirelessly and ceaselessly he paced that beat
He did not look up at the stars or follow the radiant track of the moon along the canyon ramparts
He hung his head
He was lost in another world
It was a world which the lonely desert made real
He looked a dark sad plodding figure and somehow impressed Cameron with the helplessness of men
Cameron grew acutely conscious of the pang in his own breast of the fire in his heart the strife and torment of his passiondriven soul
He had come into the desert to remember a woman
She appeared to him then as she had looked when first she entered his lifea goldenhaired girl blueeyed whiteskinned redlipped tall and slender and beautiful
He had never forgotten and an old sickening remorse knocked at his heart
He rose and climbed out of the canyon and to the top of a mesa where he paced to and fro and looked down into the weird and mystic shadows like the darkness of his passion and farther on down the moon track and the glittering stretches that vanished in the cold blue horizon
The moon soared radiant and calm the white stars shone serene
The vault of heaven seemed illimitable and divine
The desert surrounded him silverstreaked and blackmantled a chaos of rock and sand silent austere ancient always waiting
It spoke to Cameron
It was a naked corpse but it had a soul
In that wild solitude the white stars looked down upon him pitilessly and pityingly
They had shone upon a desert that might once have been alive and was now dead and might again throb with life only to die
It was a terrible ordeal for him to stand along and realize that he was only a man facing eternity
But that was what gave him strength to endure
Somehow he was a part of it all some atom in that vastness somehow necessary to an inscrutable purpose something indestructible in that desolate world of ruin and death and decay something perishable and changeable and growing under all the fixity of heaven
In that endless silent hall of desert there was a spirit and Cameron felt hovering near him what he imagined to be phantoms of peace
He returned to camp and sought his comrade
I reckon were two of a kind he said
It was a woman who drove me into the desert
But I come to remember
The deserts the only place I can to that
Was she your wife
asked the elder man
No
A long silence ensued
A cool wind blew up the canyon sifting the sand through the dry sage driving away the last of the lingering heat
The campfire wore down to a ruddy ashen heap
I had a daughter said Camerons comrade
She lost her mother at birth
And II didnt know how to bring up a girl
She was pretty and gay
It was thethe old story
His words were peculiarly significant to Cameron
They distressed him
He had been wrapped up in his remorse
If ever in the past he had thought of any one connected with the girl he had wronged he had long forgotten
But the consequences of such wrong were farreaching
They struck at the roots of a home
Here in the desert he was confronted by the spectacle of a splendid man a father wasting his life because he could not forgetbecause there was nothing left to live for
Cameron understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert
Well tell me more
asked Cameron earnestly
It was the old old story
My girl was pretty and free
The young bucks ran after her
I guess she did not run away from them
And I was away a good dealworking in another town
She was in love with a wild fellow
I knew nothing of it till too late
He was engaged to marry her
But he didnt come back
And when the disgrace became plain to all my girl left home
She went West
After a while I heard from her
She was wellworkingliving for her baby
A long time passed
I had no ties
I drifted West
Her lover had also gone West
In those days everybody went West
I trailed him intending to kill him
But I lost his trail
Neither could I find any trace of her
She had moved on driven no doubt by the hound of her past
Since then I have taken to the wilds hunting gold on the desert
Yes its the old old story only sadder I think said Cameron and his voice was strained and unnatural
Pardner what Illinois town was it you hailed from
Peoria
And youryour name
went on Cameron huskily
WarrenJonas Warren
That name might as well have been a bullet
Cameron stood erect motionless as men sometimes stand momentarily when shot straight through the heart
In an instant when thoughts resurged like blinding flashes of lightning through his mind he was a swaying quivering terrorstricken man
He mumbled something hoarsely and backed into the shadow
But he need not have feared discovery however surely his agitation might have betrayed him
Warren sat brooding over the campfire oblivious of his comrade absorbed in the past
Cameron swiftly walked away in the gloom with the blood thrumming thick in his ears whispering over and over Merciful God
Nell was his daughter
Chapter III As thought and feeling multiplied Cameron was overwhelmed
Beyond belief indeed was it that out of the millions of men in the world two who had never seen each other cold have been driven into the desert by memory of the same woman
It brought the past so close
It showed Cameron how inevitably all his spiritual life was governed by what had happened long ago
That which made life significant to him was a wandering in silent places where no eye could see him with his secret
Some fateful chance had thrown him with the father of the girl he had wrecked
It was incomprehensible it was terrible
It was the one thing of all possible happenings in the world of chance that both father and lover would have found unendurable
Camerons pain reached to despair when he felt this relation between Warren and himself
Something within him cried out to him to reveal his identity
Warren would kill him but it was not fear of death that put Cameron on the rack
He had faced death too often to be afraid
It was the thought of adding torture to this longsuffering man
All at once Cameron swore that he would not augment Warrens trouble or let him stain his hands with blood
He would tell the truth of Nells sad story and his own and make what amends he could
Then Camerons thought shifted from father to daughter
She was somewhere beyond the dim horizon line
In those past lonely hours by the campfire his fancy had tortured him with pictures of Nell
But his remorseful and cruel fancy had lied to him
Nell had struggled upward out of menacing depths
She had reconstructed a broken life
And now she was fighting for the name and happiness of her child
Little Nell
Cameron experienced a shuddering ripple in all his beingthe physical rack of an emotion born of a new and strange consciousness
As Cameron gazed out over the bloodred darkening desert suddenly the strife in his soul ceased
The moment was one of incalculable change in which his eyes seemed to pierce the vastness of cloud and range and mystery of gloom and shadowto see with strong vision the illimitable space before him
He felt the grandeur of the desert its simplicity its truth
He had learned at last the lesson it taught
No longer strange was his meeting and wandering with Warren
Each had marched in the steps of destiny and as the lines of their fates had been inextricably tangled in the years that were gone so now their steps had crossed and turned them toward one common goal
For years they had been two men marching alone answering to an inward driving search and the desert had brought them together
for years they had wandered alone in silence and solitude where the sun burned white all day and the stars burned white all night blindly following the whisper of a spirit
But now Cameron knew that he was no longer blind and in this flash of revelation he felt that it had been given him to help Warren with his burden
He returned to camp trying to evolve a plan
As always at that long hour when the afterglow of sunset lingered in the west Warren plodded to and fro in the gloom
All night Cameron lay awake thinking
In the morning when Warren brought the burros to camp and began preparations for the usual packing Cameron broke silence
Pardner your story last night made me think
I want to tell you something about myself
Its hard enough to be driven by sorrow for one youve loved as youve been driven but to suffer sleepless and eternal remorse for the ruin of one youve loved as I have sufferedthat is hell


Listen
In my younger daysit seems long now yet isnt not so many yearsI was wild
I wronged the sweetest and loveliest girl I ever knew
I went away not dreaming that any disgrace might come to her
Along about that time I fell into terrible moodsI changedI learned I really loved her
Then came a letter I should have gotten months before
It told of her troubleimportuned me to hurry to save her
Half frantic with shame and fear I got a marriage certificate and rushed back to her town
She was gonehad been gone for weeks and her disgrace was known
Friends warned me to keep out of reach of her father
I trailed her found her
I married her
But too lateShe would not live with me
She left meI followed her west but never found her
Warren leaned forward a little and looked into Camerons eyes as if searching there for the repentance that might make him less deserving of a mans scorn
Cameron met the gaze unflinchingly and again began to speak You know of course how men out here somehow lose old names old identities
It wont surprise you much to learn my name really isnt Cameron as I once told you
Warren stiffened upright
It seemed that there might have been a blank a suspension between his grave interest and some strange mood to come
Cameron felt his heart bulge and contract in his breast all his body grew cold and it took tremendous effort for him to make his lips form words
Warren Im the man youre hunting
Im Burton
I was Nells lover
The old man rose and towered over Cameron and then plunged down upon him and clutched at his throat with terrible stifling hands
The harsh contact the pain awakened Cameron to his peril before it was too late
Desperate fighting saved him from being hurled to the ground and stamped and crushed
Warren seemed a maddened giant
There was a reeling swaying wrestling struggle before the elder man began to weaken
The Cameron buffeted bloody halfstunned panted for speech
Warrenhold on
Give mea minute
I married Nell
Didnt you know thatI saved the child
Cameron felt the shock that vibrated through Warren
He repeated the words again and again
As if compelled by some resistless power Warren released Cameron and staggering back stood with uplifted shaking hands
In his face was a horrible darkness
Warren
Waitlisten
panted Cameron
Ive got that marriage certificateIve had it by me all these years
I kept itto prove to myself I did right
The old man uttered a broken cry
Cameron stole off among the rocks
How long he absented himself or what he did he had no idea
When he returned Warren was sitting before the campfire and once more he appeared composed
He spoke and his voice had a deeper note but otherwise he seemed as usual
They packed the burros and faced the north together
Cameron experienced a singular exaltation
He had lightened his comrades burden
Wonderfully it came to him that he had also lightened his own
From that hour it was not torment to think of Nell
Walking with his comrade through the silent places lying beside him under the serene luminous light of the stars Cameron began to feel the haunting presence of invisible things that were real to himphantoms whispering peace
In the moan of the cool wind in the silken seep of sifting sand in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge in the faint rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable
Even in the white noonday under the burning sun these phantoms came to be real to him
In the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them breathing nearer on the desert windnatures voices of motherhood whispers of God peace in the solitude
Chapter IV There came a morning when the sun shone angry and red through a dull smoky haze
Were in for sandstorms said Cameron
They had scarcely covered a mile when a desertwide moaning yellow wall of flying sand swooped down upon them
Seeking shelter in the lee of a rock they waited hoping the storm was only a squall such as frequently whipped across the open places
The moan increased to a roar and the dull red slowly dimmed to disappear in the yellow pall and the air grew thick and dark
Warren slipped the packs from the burros
Cameron feared the sandstorms had arrived some weeks ahead of their usual season
The men covered their heads and patiently waited
The long hours dragged and the storm increased in fury
Cameron and Warren wet scarfs with water from their canteens and bound them round their faces and then covered their heads
The steady hollow bellow of flying sand went on
It flew so thickly that enough sifted down under the shelving rock to weight the blankets and almost bury the men
They were frequently compelled to shake off the sand to keep from being borne to the ground
And it was necessary to keep digging out the packs
The floor of their shelter gradually rose higher and higher
they tried to eat and seemed to be grinding only sand between their teeth
They lost the count of time
They dared not sleep for that would have meant being buried alive
The could only crouch close to the leaning rock shake off the sand blindly dig out their packs and every moment gasp and cough and choke to fight suffocation
The storm finally blew itself out
It let the prospectors heavy and stupid for want of sleep
Their burros had wandered away or had been buried in the sand
Far as eye could reach the desert had marvelously changed it was now a rippling sea of sand dunes
Away to the north rose the peak that was their only guiding mark
They headed toward it carrying a shovel and part of their packs
At noon the peak vanished in the shimmering glare of the desert
The prospectors pushed on guided by the sun
In every wash they tried for water
With the forked peach branch in his hands Warren always succeeded in locating water
They dug but it lay too deep
At length spent and sore they fell and slept through that night and part of the next day
Then they succeeded in getting water and quenched their thirst and filled the canteens and cooked a meal
The burning day found them in an interminably wide plain where there was no shelter from the fierce sun
The men were exceedingly careful with their water though there was absolute necessity of drinking a little every hour
Late in the afternoon they came to a canyon that they believed was the lower end of the one in which they had last found water
For hours they traveled toward its head and long after night had set found what they sought
Yielding to exhaustion they slept and next day were loath to leave the waterhole
Cool night spurred them on with canteens full and renewed strength
Morning told Cameron that they had turned back miles into the desert and it was desert new to him
The red sun the increasing heat and especially the variety and large size of the cactus plants warned Cameron that he had descended to a lower level
Mountain peaks loomed on all sides some hear others distant and one a blue spur splitting the glaring sky far to the north Cameron thought he recognized as a landmark
The ascent toward it was heartbreaking not in steepness but in its leagueand leaguelong monotonous rise
Cameron knew there was only one hopeto make the water hold out and never stop to rest
Warren began to weaken
Often he had to halt
The burning white day passed and likewise the night with its white stars shining so pitilessly cold and bright
Cameron measured the water in his canteen by its weight
Evaporation by heat consumed as much as he drank
During one of the rests when he had wetted his parched mouth and throat he found opportunity to pour a little water from his canteen into Warrens
At first Cameron had curbed his restless activity to accommodate the pace of his elder comrade
but now he felt that he was losing something of his instinctive and passionate zeal to get out of the desert
The thought of water came to occupy his mind
He began to imagine that his last little store of water did not appreciably diminish
He knew he was not quite right in his mind regarding water nevertheless he felt this to be more of fact than fancy and he began to ponder
When next they rested he pretended to be in a kind of stupor but he covertly watched Warren
The man appeared far gone yet he had cunning
He cautiously took up Camerons canteen and poured water into it from his own
This troubled Cameron
The old irritation at not being able to thwart Warren returned to him
Cameron reflected and concluded that he had been unwise not to expect this very thing
Then as his comrade dropped into weary rest he lifted both canteens
If there were any water in Warrens it was only very little
Both men had been enduring the terrible desert thirst concealing it each giving his water to the other and the sacrifice had been useless
Instead of ministering to the parched throats of one or both the water had evaporated
When Cameron made sure of this he took one more drink the last and poured the little water left into Warrens canteen
He threw his own away
Soon afterward Warren discovered the loss
Wheres your canteen
he asked
The heat was getting my water so I drank what was left
My son
said Warren
The day opened for them in a red and green hell of rock and cactus
Like a flame the sun scorched and peeled their faces
Warren went blind from the glare and Cameron had to lead him
At last Warren plunged down exhausted in the shade of a ledge
Cameron rested and waited hopeless with hot weary eyes gazing down from the height where he sat
the ledge was the top step of a ragged gigantic stairway
Below stretched a sad austere and lonely valley
A dim wide streak lighter than the bordering gray wound down the valley floor
Once a river had flowed there leaving only a forlorn trace down the winding floor of this forlorn valley
Movement on the part of Warren attracted Camerons attention
Evidently the old prospector had recovered his sight and some of his strength
for he had arisen and now began to walk along the arroyo bed with his forked peach branch held before him
He had clung to the precious bit of wood
Cameron considered the prospect for water hopeless because he saw that the arroyo had once been a canyon and had been filled with sands by desert winds
Warren however stopped in a deep pit and cutting his canteen in half began to use one side of it as a scoop
He scooped out a wide hollow so wide that Cameron was certain he had gone crazy
Cameron gently urged him to stop and then forcibly tried to make him
But these efforts were futile
Warren worked with slow ceaseless methodical movement
He toiled for what seemed hours
Cameron seeing the darkening dampening sand realized a wonderful possibility of water and he plunged into the pit with the other half of the canteen
Then both men toiled round and round the wide hole down deeper and deeper
The sand grew moist then wet
At the bottom of the deep pit the sand coarsened gave place to gravel
Finally water welled in a stronger volume than Cameron ever remembered finding on the desert
It would soon fill the hole and run over
He marveled at the circumstance
The time was near the end of the dry season
Perhaps an underground stream flowed from the range behind down to the valley floor and at this point came near to the surface
Cameron had heard of such desert miracles
The finding of water revived Camerons flagging hopes
But they were shortlived
Warren had spend himself utterly
Im done
Dont linger he whispered
My son gogo
Then he fell
Cameron dragged him out of the sand pit to a sheltered place under the ledge
While sitting beside the failing man Cameron discovered painted images on the wall
Often in the desert he had found these evidences of a prehistoric people
Then from long habit he picked up a piece of rock and examined it
Its weight made him closely scrutinize it
The color was a peculiar black
He scraped through the black rust to find a piece of gold
Around him lay scattered heaps of black pebbles and bits of black weathered rock and pieces of broken ledge and they showed gold
Warren
Look
See it
Feel it
Gold
But Warren had never cared and now he was too blind to see
Gogo
he whispered
Cameron gazed down the gray reaches of the forlorn valley and something within him that was neither intelligence nor emotionsomething inscrutably strangeimpelled him to promise
The Cameron built up stone monuments to mark his gold strike
That done he tarried beside the unconscious Warren
Moments passedgrew into hours
Cameron still had strength left to make an effort to get out of the desert
But that same inscrutable something which had ordered his strange involuntary promise to Warren held him beside his fallen comrade
He watched the white sun turn to gold and then to red and sink behind mountains in the west
Twilight stole into the arroyo
It lingered slowly turning to gloom
The vault of blue black lightened to the blinking of stars
Then fell the serene silent luminous desert night
Cameron kept his vigil
As the long hours wore on he felt creep over him the comforting sense that he need not forever fight sleep
A wan glow flared behind the dark uneven horizon and a melancholy misshapen moon rose to make the white night one of shadows
Absolute silence claimed the desert
It was mute
Then that inscrutable something breathed to him telling him when he was along
He need not have looked at the dark still face beside him
Another face haunted Cameronsa womans face
It was there in the white moonlit shadows it drifted in the darkness beyond it softened changed to that of a young girl sweet with the same dark haunting eyes of her mother
Cameron prayed to that nameless thing within him the spirit of something deep and mystical as life
He prayed to that nameless thing outside of which the rocks and the sand the spiked cactus and the ragged lava the endless waste with its vast starfired mantle were but atoms
He prayed for mercy to a womanfor happiness to her child
Both mother and daughter were close to him then
Time and distance were annihilated
He had faithhe saw into the future
The fateful threads of the past so inextricably woven with his error wound out their tragic length here in this forlorn desert
CAMERON then took a little tin box from his pocket and opening it removed a folded certificate
He had kept a pen and now he wrote something upon the paper and in lieu of ink he wrote with blood
The moon afforded him enough light to see and having replaced the paper he laid the little box upon a shelf of rock
It would remain there unaffected by dust moisture heat time
How long had those painted images been there clear and sharp on the dry stone walls
There were no trails in that desert and always there were incalculable changes
Cameron saw this mutable mood of naturethe sands would fly and seep and carve and bury the floods would dig and cut the ledges would weather in the heat and rain the avalanches would slide the cactus seeds would roll in the wind to catch in a niche and split the soil with thirsty roots
Years would pass
Cameron seemed to see them too and likewise destiny leading a child down into this forlorn waste where she would find love and fortune and the grave of her father
Cameron covered the dark still face of his comrade from the light of the waning moon
That action was the severing of his hold on realities
They fell away from him in final separation
Vaguely dreamily he seemed to behold his soul
Night merged into gray day and night came again weird and dark
Then up out of the vast void of the desert from the silence and illimitableness trooped his phantoms of peace
Majestically they formed around him marshalling and mustering in ceremonious state and moved to lay upon him their passionless serenity
Chapter I Old Friends Richard Gale reflected that his sojourn in the West had been what his disgusted father had predictedidling here and there with no objective point or purpose
It was reflection such as this only more serious and perhaps somewhat desperate that had brought Gale down to the border
For some time the newspapers had been printing news of Mexican revolution guerrilla warfare United States cavalry patrolling the international line American cowboys fighting with the rebels and wild stories of bold raiders and bandits
But as opportunity and adventure too had apparently given him a wide berth in Montana Wyoming Colorado he had struck southwest for the Arizona border where he hoped to see some stirring life
He did not care very much what happened
Months of futile wandering in the hope of finding a place where he fitted had inclined Richard to his fathers opinion
It was after dark one evening in early October when Richard arrived in Casita
He was surprised to find that it was evidently a town of importance
There was a jostling jabbering sombreroed crowd of Mexicans around the railroad station
He felt as if he were in a foreign country
After a while he saw several men of his nationality one of whom he engaged to carry his luggage to a hotel
They walked up a wide welllighted street lined with buildings in which were bright windows
Of the many people encountered by Gale most were Mexicans
His guide explained that the smaller half of Casita lay in Arizona the other half in Mexico and of several thousand inhabitants the majority belonged on the southern side of the street which was the boundary line
He also said that rebels had entered the town that day causing a good deal of excitement
Gale was almost at the end of his financial resources which fact occasioned him to turn away from a pretentious hotel and to ask his guide for a cheaper lodginghouse
When this was found a sight of the loungers in the office and also a desire for comfort persuaded Gale to change his travelingclothes for rough outing garb and boots
Well Im almost broke he soliloquized thoughtfully
The governor said I wouldnt make any money
Hes rightso far
And he said Id be coming home beaten
There hes wrong
Ive got a hunch that something ll happen to me in this Greaser town
He went out into a wide whitewashed highceiled corridor and from that into an immense room which but for pool tables bar benches would have been like a courtyard
The floor was cobblestoned the walls were of adobe and the large windows opened like doors
A blue cloud of smoke filled the place
Gale heard the click of pool balls and the clink of glasses along the crowded bar
Barelegged sandalfooted Mexicans in white rubbed shoulders with Mexicans mantled in black and red
There were others in tightfitting blue uniforms with gold fringe or tassels at the shoulders
These men wore belts with heavy bonehandled guns and evidently were the rurales or native policemen
There were blackbearded coarsevisaged Americans some gambling round the little tables others drinking
The pool tables were the center of a noisy crowd of younger men several of whom were unsteady on their feet
There were khakiclad cavalrymen strutting in and out
At one end of the room somewhat apart from the general meelee was a group of six men round a little table four of whom were seated the other two standing
These last two drew a second glance from Gale
The sharpfeatured bronzed faces and piercing eyes the tall slender loosely jointed bodies the quiet easy reckless air that seemed to be a part of the menthese things would plainly have stamped them as cowboys without the buckled sombreros the colored scarfs the hightopped highheeled boots with great silverroweled spurs
Gale did not fail to note also that these cowboys wore guns and this fact was rather a shock to his idea of the modern West
It caused him to give some credence to the rumors of fighting along the border and he felt a thrill
He satisfied his hunger in a restaurant adjoining and as he stepped back into the saloon a man wearing a military cape jostled him
Apologies from both were instant
Gale was moving on when the other stopped short as if startled and leaning forward exclaimed Dick Gale
Youve got me replied Gale in surprise
But I dont know you
He could not see the strangers face because it was wholly shaded by a widebrimmed hat pulled well down
By Jove
Its Dick
If this isnt great
Dont you know me
Ive heard your voice somewhere replied Gale
Maybe Ill recognize you if you come out from under that bonnet
For answer the man suddenly manifesting thought of himself hurriedly drew Gale into the restaurant where he thrust back his hat to disclose a handsome sunburned face
George Thorne
So help me Ssssh
You neednt yell interrupted the other as he met Gales outstretched hand
There was a close hard straining grip
I must not be recognized here
There are reasons
Ill explain in a minute
Say but its fine to see you
Five years Dick five years since I saw you run down University Field and spreadeagle the whole Wisconsin football team
Dont recollect that replied Dick laughing
George Ill bet you Im gladder to see you than you are to see me
It seems to long
You went into the army didnt you
I did
Im here now with the Ninth Cavalry
Butnever mind me
Whatre you doing way down here
Say I just noticed your togs
Dick you cant be going in for mining or ranching not in this Godforsaken desert
On the square George I dont know any more why Im here thanthan you know
Well that beats me
ejaculated Thorne sitting back in his chair amaze and concern in his expression
What the devils wrong
Your old mans got too much money for you ever to be up against it
Dick you couldnt have gone to the bad
A tide of emotion surged over Gale
How good it was to meet a friendsome one to whom to talk
He had never appreciated his loneliness until that moment
George how I ever drifted down here I dont know
I didnt exactly quarrel with the governor
Butdamn it Dad hurt meshamed me and I dug out for the West
It was this way
After leaving college I tried to please him by tackling one thing after another that he set me to do
On the square I had no head for business
I made a mess of everything
The governor got sore
He kept ramming the harpoon into me till I just couldnt stand it
What little ability I possessed deserted me when I got my back up and there you are
Dad and I had a rather uncomfortable half hour
When I quitwhen I told him straight out that I was going West to fare for myself why it wouldnt have been so tough if he hadnt laughed at me
He called me a rich mans sonan idle easygoing spineless swell
He said I didnt even have character enough to be out and out bad
He said I didnt have sense enough to marry one of the nice girls in my sisters crowd
He said I couldnt get back home unless I sent to him for money
He said he didnt believe I could fightcould really make a fight for anything under the sun
Ohhehe shot it into me all right
Dick dropped his head upon his hands somewhat ashamed of the smarting dimness in his eyes
He had not meant to say so much
Yet what a relief to let out that longcongested burden
Fight
cried Thorne hotly
Whats ailing him
Didnt they call you Biff Gale in college
Dick you were one of the best men Stagg ever developed
I heard him say sothat you were the fastest onehundredandseventyfivepound man hed ever trained the hardest to stop
The governor didnt count football said Dick
He didnt mean that kind of fight
When I left home I dont think I had an idea what was wrong with me
But George I think I know now
I was a rich mans sonspoiled dependent absolutely ignorant of the value of money
I havent yet discovered any earning capacity in me
I seem to be unable to do anything with my hands
Thats the trouble
But Im at the end of my tether now
And Im going to punch cattle or be a miner or do some real stuntlike joining the rebels
Aha
I thought youd spring that last one on me declared Thorne wagging his head
Well you just forget it
Say old boy theres something doing in Mexico
The United States in general doesnt realize it
But across that line there are crazy revolutionists illpaid soldiers guerrilla leaders raiders robbers outlaws bandits galore starving peons by the thousand girls and women in terror
Mexico is like some of her volcanoesready to erupt fire and hell
Dont make the awful mistake of joining rebel forces
Americans are hated by Mexicans of the lower class the fighting class both rebel and federal
Half the time these crazy Greasers are on one side then on the other
If you didnt starve or get shot in ambush or die of thirst some Greaser would knife you in the back for you belt buckle or boots
There are a good many Americans with the rebels eastward toward Agua Prieta and Juarez
Orozco is operating in Chihuahua and I guess he has some idea of warfare
But this Sonora a mountainous desert the home of the slave and the Yaqui
Theres unorganized revolt everywhere
The American miners and ranchers those who could get away have fled across into the States leaving property
Those who couldnt or wouldnt come must fight for their lives are fighting now
Thats bad said Gale
Its news to me
Why doesnt the government take action do something
Afraid of international complications
Dont want to offend the Maderists or be criticized by jealous foreign nations
Its a delicate situation Dick
The Washington officials know the gravity of it you can bet
But the United States in general is in the dark and the armywell you ought to hear the inside talk back at San Antonio
Were patrolling the boundary line
Were making a grand bluff
I could tell you of a dozen instances where cavalry should have pursued raiders on the other side of the line
But we wont do it
The officers are a grouchy lot these days
You see of course what significance would attach to United States cavalry going into Mexican territory
There would simply be hell
My own colonel is the sorest man on the job
Were all sore
Its like sitting on a powder magazine
We cant keep the rebels and raiders from crossing the line
Yet we dont fight
My commission expires soon
Ill be discharged in three months
You can bet Im glad for more reasons than Ive mentioned
Thorne was evidently laboring under strong suppressed excitement
His face showed pale under the tan and his eyes gleamed with a dark fire
Occasionally his delight at meeting talking with Gale dominated the other emotions but not for long
He had seated himself at a table near one of the doorlike windows leading into the street and every little while he would glance sharply out
Also he kept consulting his watch
These details gradually grew upon Gale as Thorne talked
George it strikes me that youre upset said Dick presently
I seem to remember you as a coolheaded fellow whom nothing could disturb
Has the army changed you
Thorne laughed
It was a laugh with a strange high note
It was recklessit hinted of exaltation
He rose abruptly he gave the water money to go for drinks he looked into the saloon and then into the street
On this side of the house there was a porch opening on a plaza with trees and shrubbery and branches
Thorne peered out one window then another
His actions were rapid
Returning to the table he put his hands upon it and leaned over to look closely into Gales face
Im away from camp without leave he said
Isnt that a serious offense
asked Dick
Serious
For me if Im discovered it means ruin
There are rebels in town
Any moment we might have trouble
I ought to be ready for dutywithin call
If Im discovered it means arrest
That means delaythe failure of my plansruin
Gale was silenced by his friends intensity
Thorne bent over closer with his dark eyes searching bright
we were old palsonce
Surely replied Dick
What would you say Dick Gale if I told you that youre the one man Id rather have had come along than any other at this crisis of my life
The earnest gaze the passionate voice with its deep tremor drew Dick upright thrilling and eager conscious of strange unfamiliar impetuosity
Thorne I should say I was glad to be the fellow replied Dick
Their hands locked for a moment and they sat down again with heads close over the table
Listen began Thorne in low swift whisper a few days a week agoit seems like a yearI was of some assistance to refugees fleeing from Mexico into the States
They were all women and one of them was dressed as a nun
Quite by accident I saw her face
It was that of a beautiful girl
I observed she kept aloof from the others
I suspected a disguise and when opportunity afforded spoke to her offered my services
She replied to my poor efforts at Spanish in fluent English
She had fled in terror from her home some place down in Sinaloa
Rebels are active there
Her father was captured and held for ransom
When the ransom was paid the rebels killed him the leader of these rebels was a bandit named Rojas
Long before the revolution began he had been feared by people of classloved by the peons
Bandits are worshiped by the peons
All of the famous bandits have robbed the rich and given to the poor
Rojas saw the daughter made off with her
But she contrived to bribe her guards and escaped almost immediately before any harm befell her
She hid among friends
Rojas nearly tore down the town in his efforts to find her
Then she disguised herself and traveled by horseback stage and train to Casita
Her story fascinated me and that one fleeting glimpse I had of her face I couldnt forget
She had no friends here no money
She knew Rojas was trailing her
This talk I had with her was at the railroad station where all was bustle and confusion
No one noticed us so I thought
I advised her to remove the disguise of a nun before she left the waitingroom
And I got a boy to guide her
But he fetched her to his house
I had promised to come in the evening to talk over the situation with her
I found her Dick and when I saw herI went stark staring raving mad over her
She is the most beautiful wonderful girl I ever saw
Her name is Mercedes Castaneda and she belongs to one of the old wealthy Spanish families
She has lived abroad and in Havana
She speaks French as well as English
She isbut I must be brief
Dick think think
With Mercedes also it was love at first sight
My plan is to marry her and get her farther to the interior away from the border
It may not be easy
Shes watched
So am I
It was impossible to see her without the women of this house knowing
At first perhaps they had only curiosityan itch to gossip
But the last two days there has been a change
Since last night theres some powerful influence at work
Oh these Mexicans are subtle mysterious
After all they are Spaniards
They work in secret in the dark
They are dominated first by religion then by gold then by passion for a woman
Rojas must have got word to his friends here yesterday his gang of cutthroat rebels arrived and today he came
When I learned that I took my chance and left camp I hunted up a priest
He promised to come here
Its time hes due
But Im afraid hell be stopped
Thorne why dont you take the girl and get married without waiting without running these risks
said Dick
I fear its too late now
I should have done that last night
You see were over the line Are we in Mexican territory now
queried Gale sharply
I guess yes old boy
Thats what complicates it
Rojas and his rebels have Casita in their hands
But Rojas without his rebels would be able to stop me get the girl and make for his mountain haunts
If Mercedes is really watchedif her identity is known which I am sure is the casewe couldnt get far from this house before Id be knifed and she seized
Good Heavens
Thorne can that sort of thing happen less than a stones throw from the United States line
asked Gale incredulously
It can happen and dont you forget it
You dont seem to realize the power these guerrilla leaders these rebel captains and particularly these bandits exercise over the mass of Mexicans
A bandit is a man of honor in Mexico
He is feared envied loved
In the hearts of the people he stands next to the national idolthe bullfighter the matador
The race has a wild barbarian bloody strain
Take Quinteros for instance
He was a peon a slave
He became a famous bandit
At the outbreak of the revolution he proclaimed himself a leader and with a band of followers he devastated whole counties
The opposition to federal forces was only a blind to rob and riot and carry off women
The motto of this man and his followers was Let us enjoy ourselves while we may
There are other bandits besides Quinteros not so famous or such great leaders but just as bloodthirsty
Ive seen Rojas
Hes a handsome bold sneering devil vainer than any peacock
He decks himself in gold lace and sliver trappings in all the finery he can steal
He was one of the rebels who helped sack Sinaloa and carry off half a million in money and valuables
Rojas spends gold like he spills blood
But he is chiefly famous for abducting women
the peon girls consider it an honor to be ridden off with
Rojas has shown a penchant for girls of the better class
Thorne wiped the perspiration from his pale face and bent a dark gaze out of the window before he resumed his talk
Consider what the position of Mercedes really is
I cant get any help from our side of the line
If so I dont know where
The population on that side is mostly Mexican absolutely in sympathy with whatever actuates those on this side
The whole caboodle of Greasers on both sides belong to the class in sympathy with the rebels the class that secretly respects men like Rojas and hates an aristocrat like Mercedes
They would conspire to throw her into his power
Rojas can turn all the hidden underground influences to his ends
Unless I thwart him hell get Mercedes as easily as he can light a cigarette
But Ill kill him or some of his gang or her before I let him get her



This is the situation old friend
Ive little time to spare
I face arrest for desertion
Rojas is in town
I think I was followed to this hotel
The priest has betrayed me or has been stopped
Mercedes is here alone waiting absolutely dependent upon me to save her fromfromShes the sweetest loveliest girlIn a few momentssooner or later therell be hell here
Dick are you with me
Dick Gale drew a long deep breath
A coldness a lethargy an indifference that had weighed upon him for months had passed out of his being
On the instant he could not speak but his hand closed powerfully upon his friends
Thornes face changed wonderfully the distress the fear the appeal all vanishing in a smile of passionate gratefulness
Then Dicks gaze attracted by some slight sound shot over his friends shoulder to see a face at the windowa handsome bold sneering face with glittering dark eyes that flashed in sinister intentness
Dick stiffened in his seat
Thorne with sudden clenching of hands wheeled toward the window
Rojas
he whispered
Chapter II Mercedes Castaneda The dark face vanished
Dick Gale heard footsteps and the tinkle of spurs
He strode to the window and was in time to see a Mexican swagger into the front door of the saloon
Dick had only a glimpse but in that he saw a huge black sombrero with a gaudy band the back of a short tightfitting jacket a heavy pearlhandled gun swinging with a fringe of sash and closefitting trousers spreading wide at the bottom
There were men passing in the street also several Mexicans lounging against the hitchingrail at the curb
Did you see him
Where did he go
whispered Thorne as he joined Gale
Those Greasers out there with the cartridge belts crossed over their breaststhey are rebels
I think he went into the saloon replied Dick
He had a gun but for all I can see the Greasers out there are unarmed
Never believe it
There
Look Dick
That fellows a guard though he seems so unconcerned
See he has a short carbine almost concealedTheres another Greaser farther down the path
Im afraid Rojas has the house spotted
If we could only be sure
Im sure Dick
Lets cross the hall I want to see how it looks from the other side of the house
Gale followed Thorne out of the restaurant into the highceiled corridor which evidently divided the hotel opening into the street and running back to a patio
A few dim yellow lamps flickered
A Mexican with a blanket round his shoulders stood in the front entrance
Back toward the patio there were sounds of boots on the stone floor
Shadows flitted across that end of the corridor
Thorne entered a huge chamber which was even more poorly lighted than the hall
It contained a table littered with papers a few highbacked chairs a couple of couches and was evidently a parlor
Mercedes has been meeting me here said thorne
At this hour she comes every moment or so to the head of the stairs there and if I am here she comes down
Mostly there are people in this room a little later
We go out into the plaza
It faces the dark side of the house and thats the place I must slip out with her if theres any chance at all to get away
They peered out of the open window
The plaza was gloomy and at first glance apparently deserted
In a moment however Gale made out a slowpacing dark form on the path
Farther down there was another
No particular keenness was required to see in these forms a sentinellike stealthiness
Gripping Gales arm Thorne pulled back from the window
You saw them he whispered
Its just as I feared
Rojas has the place surrounded
I should have taken Mercedes away
But I had no timeno chance
Im boundTheres Mercedes now
My GodDick thinkthink if theres a way to get her out of this trap
Gale turned as his friend went down the room
In the dim light at the head of the stairs stood the slim muffled figure of a woman
When she saw Thorne she flew noiselessly down the stairway to him
He caught her in his arms
Then she spoke softly brokenly in a low swift voice
It was a mingling of incoherent Spanish and English but to Gale it was mellow deep unutterably tender a voice full of joy fear passion hope and love
Upon Gale it had an unaccountable effect
He found himself thrilling wondering
Thorne led the girl to the center of the room under the light where Gale stood
She had raised a white hand holding a blacklaced mantilla half aside
Dick saw a small dark head proudly held an oval face half hidden white as a flower and magnificent black eyes
Then Thorne spoke
MercedesDick Gale an old friendthe best friend I ever had
She swept the mantilla back over her head disclosing a lovely face strange and striking to Gale in its pride and fire its intensity
Senor Galeah
I cannot speak my happiness
His friend
Yes Mercedes my friend and yours said Thorne speaking rapidly
Well have need of him
Dear theres bad news and no time to break it gently
the priest did not come
He must have been detained
And listenbe brave dear MercedesRojas is here
She uttered an inarticulate cry the poignant terror of which shook Gales nerve and swayed as if she would faint
Thorne caught her and in husky voice importuned her to bear up
My darling
For Gods sake dont faintdont go to pieces
Wed be lost
Weve got a chance
Well think of something
Be strong
Fight
It was plain to Gale that Thorne was distracted
He scarcely knew what he was saying
Please and shaking he clasped Mercedes to him
Her terror had struck him helpless
It was so intenseit was so full of horrible certainty of what fate awaited her
She cried out in Spanish beseeching him and as he shook his head she changed to English Senor my lover I will be strongI will fightI will obey
But swear by my Virgin if need be to save me from Rojasyou will kill me
Mercedes
Yes Ill swear he replied hoarsely
I knowId rather have you dead than But dont give up
Rojas cant be sure of you or he wouldnt wait
Hes in there
Hes got his men thereall around us
But he hesitates
A beast like Rojas doesnt stand idle for nothing
I tell you weve a chance
Dick here will think of something
Well slip away
Then hell take you somewhere
Onlyspeak to himshow him you wont weaken
Mercedes this is more than love and happiness for us
Its life or death
She became quiet and slowly recovered control of herself
Suddenly she wheeled to face Gale with proud dark eyes tragic sweetness of appeal and exquisite grace
Senor you are an American
You cannot know the Spanish bloodthe peon bandits hate and cruelty
I wish to die before Rojass hand touches me
If he takes me alive then the hour the little day that my life lasts afterward will be torturedtorture of hell
If I live two days his brutal men will have me
If I live three the dogs of his campSenor have you a sister whom you love
Help Senor Thorne to save me
He is a soldier
He is bound
He must not betray his honor his duty for meAh you two splendid Americansso big so strong so fierce
What is that little black halfbreed slave Rojas to such men
Rojas is a coward
Now let me waste no more precious time
I am ready
I will be brave
She came close to Gale holding out her white hands a woman all fire and soul and passion
to Gale she was wonderful
His heart leaped
As he bent over her hands and kissed them he seemed to feel himself renewed remade
Senorita he said I am happy to be your servant
I can conceive of no greater pleasure than giving the service you require
And what is that
inquired Thorne hurriedly
That of incapacitating Senor Rojas for tonight and perhaps several nights to come replied Gale
Dick what will you do
asked Thorne now in alarm
Ill make a row in that saloon returned Dick bluntly
Ill start something
Ill rush Rojas and his crowd
Ill Lord no you mustnt Dickyoull be knifed
cried Thorne
He was in distress yet his eyes were shining
Ill take a chance
Maybe I can surprise that slow Greaser bunch and get away before they know whats happenedYou be ready watching at the window
When the row starts those fellows out there in the plaza will run into the saloon
Then you slip out go straight through the plaza down the street
Its a dark street I remember
Ill catch up with you before you get far
Thorne gasped but did not say a word
Mercedes leaned against him her white hands now at her breast her great eyes watching Gale as he went out
In the corridor Gale stopped long enough to pull on a pair of heavy gloves to muss his hair and disarrange his collar
Then he stepped into the restaurant went through and halted in the door leading into the saloon
His five feet eleven inches and one hundred and eighty pounds were more noticeable there and it was part of his plan to attract attention to himself
No one however appeared to notice him
The poolplayers were noisily intent on their game the same crowd of motleyrobed Mexicans hung over the reeking bar
Gales roving glance soon fixed upon the man he took to be Rojas
He recognized the huge highpeaked black sombrero with its ornamented band
The Mexicans face was turned aside
He was in earnest excited colloquy with a dozen or more comrades most of whom were sitting round a table
They were listening talking drinking
The fact that they wore cartridge belts crossed over their breasts satisfied that these were the rebels
He had noted the belts of the Mexicans outside who were apparently guards
A waiter brought more drinks to this group at the table and this caused the leader to turn so Gale could see his face
It was indeed the sinister sneering face of the bandit Rojas
Gale gazed at the man with curiosity
He was under medium height and striking in appearance only because of his dandified dress and evil visage
He wore a lace scarf a tight brightbuttoned jacket a buckskin vest embroidered in red a sash and belt joined by an enormous silver clasp
Gale saw again the pearlhandled gun swinging at the bandits hip
Jewels flashed in his scarf
There were gold rings in his ears and diamonds on his fingers
Gale became conscious of an inward fire that threatened to overrun his coolness
Other emotions harried his selfcontrol
It seemed as if sight of the man liberated or created a devil in Gale
And at the bottom of his feelings there seemed to be a wonder at himself a strange satisfaction for the something that had come to him
He stepped out of the doorway down the couple of steps to the floor of the saloon and he staggered a little simulating drunkenness
He fell over the pool tables jostled Mexicans at the bar laughed like a maudlin fool and with his hat slouched down crowded here and there
Presently his eye caught sight of the group of cowboys whom he had before noticed with such interest
They were still in a corner somewhat isolated
With fertile mind working Gale lurched over to them
He remembered his many unsuccessful attempts to get acquainted with cowboys
If he were to get any help from these silent aloof rangers it must be by striking fire from them in one swift stroke
Planting himself squarely before the two tall cowboys who were standing he looked straight into their lean bronzed faces
He spared a full moment for that keen cool gaze before he spoke
Im not drunk
Im throwing a bluff and I mean to start a rough house
Im going to rush that damned bandit Rojas
Its to save a girlto give her lover who is my friend a chance to escape with her
When I start a row my friend will try to slip out with her
Every door and window is watched
Ive got to raise hell to draw the guards in Well youre my countrymen
Were in Mexico
A beautiful girls honor and life are at stake
Now gentlemen watch me
One cowboys eyes narrowed blinking a little and his lean jaw dropped the others hard face rippled with a fleeting smile
Gale backed away and his pulse leaped when he saw the two cowboys as if with one purpose slowly stride after him
Then Gale swerved staggering along brushed against the tables kicked over the empty chairs
He passed Rojas and his gang and out of the tail of his eye saw that the bandit was watching him waving his hands and talking fiercely
The hum of the many voices grew louder and when Dick lurched against a table overturning it and spilling glasses into the laps of several Mexicans there arose a shrill cry
He had succeeded in attracting attention almost every face turned his way
One of the insulted men a little tawny fellow leaped up to confront Gale and in a frenzy screamed a volley of Spanish of which Gale distinguished Gringo
The Mexican stamped and made a threatening move with his right hand
Dick swung his leg and with a swift side kick knocked the fellows feet from under him whirling him down with a thud
The action was performed so suddenly so adroitly it made the Mexican such a weakling so like a tumbled tenpin that the shrill jabbering hushed
Gale knew this to be the significant moment
Wheeling he rushed at Rojas
It was his old linebreaking plunge
Neither Rojas nor his men had time to move
The blackskinned bandits face turned a dirty white his jaw dropped he would have shrieked if Gale had not hit him
The blow swept him backward against his men
Then Gales heavy body swiftly following with the momentum of that rush struck the little group of rebels
They went down with table and chairs in a sliding crash
Gale carried by his plunge went with them
Like a cat he landed on top
As he rose his powerful hands fastened on Rojas
He jerked the little bandit off the tangled pile of struggling yelling men and swinging him with terrific force let go his hold
Rojas slid along the floor knocking over tables and chairs
Gale bounded back dragged Rojas up handling him as if he were a limp sack
A shot rang out above the yells
Gale heard the jingle of breaking glass
The room darkened perceptibly
He flashed a glance backward
The two cowboys were between him and the crowd of frantic rebels
One cowboy held two guns low down level in front of him
The other had his gun raised and aimed
On the instant it spouted red and white
With the crack came the crashing of glass another darkening shade over the room
With a cry Gale slung the bleeding Rojas from him
The bandit struck a table toppled over it fell and lay prone
Another shot made the room full of moving shadows with light only back of the bar
A whiteclad figure rushed at Gale
He tripped the man but had to kick hard to disengage himself from grasping hands
Another figure closed in on Gale
This one was dark swift
A blade glinteddescribed a circle alot
Simultaneously with a close red flash the knife wavered the man wielding it stumbled backward
In the din Gale did not hear a report but the Mexicans fall was significant
Then pandemonium broke loose
The din became a roar
Gale heard shots that sounded like dull spats in the distance
The big lamp behind the bar seemingly split then sputtered and went out leaving the room in darkness
Gale leaped toward the restaurant door which was outlined faintly by the yellow light within
Right and left he pushed the groping men who jostled with him
He vaulted a pool table sent tables and chairs flying and gained the door to be the first of a wedging mob to squeeze through
One sweep of his arm knocked the restaurant lamp from its stand and he ran out leaving darkness behind him
A few bounds took him into the parlor
It was deserted
Thorne had gotten away with Mercedes
It was then Gale slowed up
For the space of perhaps sixty seconds he had been moving with startling velocity
He peered cautiously out into the plaza
The paths the benches the shady places under the trees contained no skulking men
He ran out keeping to the shade and did not go into the path till he was halfway through the plaza
Under a street lamp at the far end of the path he thought he saw two dark figures
He ran faster and soon reached the street
The uproar back in the hotel began to diminish or else he was getting out of hearing
The few people he saw close at hand were all coming his way and only the foremost showed any excitement
Gale walked swiftly peering ahead for two figures
Presently he saw themone tall wearing a cape the other slight mantled
Gale drew a sharp breath of relief
Throne and Mercedes were not far ahead
From time to time Thorne looked back
He strode swiftly almost carrying Mercedes who clung closely to him
She too looked back
Once Gale saw her white face flash in the light of a street lamp
He began to overhaul them and soon when the last lamp had been passed and the street was dark he ventured a whistle
Thorne heard it for he turned whistled a low reply and went on
Not for some distance beyond where the street ended in open country did they halt to wait
The desert began here
Gale felt the soft sand under his feet and saw the grotesque forms of cactus
Then he came up with the fugitives
Dick
Are youall right
panted Thorne grasping Gale
Imout of breathbutOK replied Gale
Good
Good
choked Thorne
I was scaredhelplessDick it worked splendidly
We had no trouble
What on earth did you do
I made the row all right said Dick
Good Heavens
It was like a row I once heard made by a mob
But the shots Dickwere they at you
They paralyzed me
Then the yells
what happened
Those guards of Rojas ran round in front at the first shot
Tell me what happened
While I was rushing Rojas a couple of cowboys shot out the lamplights
A Mexican who pulled a knife on me got hurt I guess
Then I think there was some shooting from the rebels after the room was dark
Rushing Rojas
queried Thorne leaning close to Dick
His voice was thrilling exultant deep with a joy that yet needed confirmation
What did you do to him
I handed him one off side tackled then tried a forward pass replied Dick lightly speaking the football vernacular so familiar to Thorne
Thorne leaned closer his fine face showing fierce and corded in the starlight
Tell me straight he demanded in thick voice
Gale then divined something of the suffering Thorne had undergone something of the hot wild vengeful passion of a lover who must have brutal truth
It stilled Dicks lighter mood and he was about to reply when Mercedes pressed close to him touched his hands looked up into his face with wonderful eyes
He thought he would not soon forget their beautythe shadow of pain that had been the hope dawning so fugitively
Dear lady said Gale with voice not wholly steady Rojas himself will hound you no more tonight nor for many nights
She seemed to shake to thrill to rise with the intelligence
She pressed his hand close over her heaving breast
Gale felt the quick throb of her heart
Senor
Senor Dick
she cried
Then her voice failed
But her hands flew up quick as a flash she raised her facekissed him
Then she turned and with a sob fell into Thornes arms
There ensued a silence broken only by Mercedes sobbing
Gale walked some paces away
If he were not stunned he certainly was agitated
the strange sweet fire of that girls lips remained with him
On the spur of the moment he imagined he had a jealousy of Thorne
But presently this passed
It was only that he had been deeply movedstirred to the depths during the last hourhad become conscious of the awakening of a spirit
What remained with him now was the splendid glow of gladness that he had been of service to Thorne
And by the intensity of Mercedes abandon of relief and gratitude he measured her agony of terror and the fate he had spared her
Dick Dick come here
called Thorne softly
Lets pull ourselves together now
Weve got a problem yet
What to do
Where to go
How to get any place
We dont dare risk the stationthe corrals where Mexicans hire out horses
Were on gold old US ground this minute but were not out of danger
As he paused evidently hoping for a suggestion from Gale the silence was broken by the clear ringing peal of a bugle
Thorne gave a violent start
Then he bent over listening
The beautiful notes of the bugle floated out of the darkness clearer sharper faster
Its a call Dick
Its a call
he cried
Gale had no answer to make
Mercedes stood as if stricken
The bugle call ended
From a distance another faintly pealed
There were other sounds too remote to recognize
Then scattering shots rattled out
Dick the rebels are fighting somebody burst out Thorne excitedly
The little federal garrison still holds its stand
Perhaps it is attacked again
Anyway theres something doing over the line
Maybe the crazy Greasers are firing on our camp
Weve feared itin the darkAnd here I am away without leavepractically a deserter
Go back
Go back before youre too late
cried Mercedes
Better make tracks Thorne added Gale
It cant help our predicament for you to be arrested
Ill take care of Mercedes
No no no replied Thorne
I can get awayavoid arrest
Thatd be all right for the immediate present
But its not best for the future
George a deserter is a deserterBetter hurry
Leave the girl to me till tomorrow
Mercedes embraced her lover begged him to go
Thorne wavered
Dick Im up against it he said
Youre right
If only I can get back in time
but oh I hate to leave her
Old fellow youve saved her
I already owe you everlasting gratitude
Keep out of Casita Dick
The US side might be safe but Im afraid to trust it at night
Go out in the desert up in the mountains in some safe place
Then come to me in camp
Well plan
Ill have to confide in Colonel Weede
Maybe hell help us
Hide her from the rebelsthats all
He wrung Dicks hand clasped Mercedes tightly in his arms kissed her and murmured low over her then released her to rush off into the darkness
He disappeared in the gloom
The sound of his dull footfalls gradually died away
For a moment the desert silence oppressed Gale
He was unaccustomed to such strange stillness
There was a low stir of sand a rustle of stiff leaves in the wind
How white the stars burned
Then a coyote barked to be bayed by a dog
Gale realized that he was between the edge of an unknown desert and the edge of a hostile town
He had to choose the desert because though he had no doubt that in Casita there were many Americans who might befriend him he could not chance the risks of seeking them at night
He felt a slight touch on his arm felt it move down felt Mercedes slip a trembling cold little hand into his
Dick looked at her
She seemed a whitefaced girl now with staring frightened black eyes that flashed up at him
If the loneliness the silence the desert the unknown dangers of the night affected him what must they be to this hunted driven girl
Gales heart swelled
He was alone with her
He had no weapon no money no food no drink no covering nothing except his two hands
He had absolutely no knowledge of the desert of the direction or whereabouts of the boundary line between the republics he did not know where to find the railroad or any road or trail or whether or not there were towns near or far
It was a critical desperate situation
He thought first of the girl and groaned in spirit prayed that it would be given him to save her
When he remembered himself it was with the stunning consciousness that he could conceive of no situation which he would have exchanged for this onewhere fortune had set him a perilous task of loyalty to a friend to a helpless girl
Senor senor
suddenly whispered Mercedes clinging to him
Listen
I hear horses coming
Chapter III A Flight Into The Desert Uneasy and startled Gale listened and hearing nothing wondered if Mercedess fears had not worked upon her imagination
He felt a trembling seize her and he held her hands tightly
You were mistaken I guess he whispered
No no senor
Dick turned his ear to the soft wind
Presently he heard or imagined he heard low beats
Like the first faint faroff beats of a drumming grouse they recalled to him the Illinois forests of his boyhood
In a moment he was certain the sounds were the padlike steps of hoofs in yielding sand
The regular tramp was not that of grazing horses
On the instant made cautious and stealthy by alarm Gale drew Mercedes deeper into the gloom of the shrubbery
Sharp pricks from thorns warned him that he was pressing into a cactus growth and he protected Mercedes as best he could
She was shaking as one with a sever chill
She breathed with little hurried pants and leaned upon him almost in collapse
Gale ground his teeth in helpless rage at the girls fate
If she had not been beautiful she might still have been free and happy in her home
What a strange world to live inhow unfair was fate
The sounds of hoofbeats grew louder
Gale made out a dark moving mass against a background of dull gray
There was a line of horses
He could not discern whether or not all the horses carried riders
The murmur of a voice struck his earthen a low laugh
It made him tingle for it sounded American
Eagerly he listened
There was an interval when only the hoofbeats could be heard
It shore was Laddy it shore was came a voice out of the darkness
Rough house
Laddy since wire fences drove us out of Texas we aint seen the like of that
An we never had such a call
Call
It was a burnin roast replied another voice
I felt low down
He vamoosed some sudden an I hope he an his friends shook the dust of Casita
Thats a rotten town Jim
Gale jumped up in joy
What luck
The speakers were none other than the two cowboys whom he had accosted in the Mexican hotel
Hold on  fellows he called out and strode into the road
The horses snorted and stamped
Then followed swift rustling soundsa clinking of spurs then silence
The figures loomed clearer in the gloom Gale saw five or six horses two with riders and one other at least carrying a pack
When Gale got within fifteen feet of the group the foremost horseman said I reckon thats close enough stranger
Something in the cowboys hand glinted darkly bright in the starlight
Youd recognize me if it wasnt so dark replied Gale halting
I spoke to you a little while agoin the saloon back there
Come over an lets see you said the cowboy curtly
Gale advanced till he was close to the horse
The cowboy leaned over the saddle and peered into Gales face
Then without a word he sheathed the gun and held out his hand
Gale met a grip of steel that warmed his blood
The other cowboy got off his nervous spirited horse and threw the bridle
He too peered closely into Gales face
My names Ladd he said
Reckon Im some glad to meet you again
Gale felt another grip as hard and strong as the other had been
He realized he had found friends who belonged to a class of men whom he had despaired of ever knowing
GaleDick Gale is my name he began swiftly
I dropped into Casita tonight hardly knowing where I was
A boy took me to that hotel
There I met an old friend whom I had not seen for years
He belongs to the cavalry stationed here
He had befriended a Spanish girlfallen in love with her
Rojas had killed this girls fathertried to abduct herYou know what took place at the hotel
Gentlemen if its ever possible Ill show you how I appreciate what you did for me there
I got away found my friend with the girl
We hurried out here beyond the edge of town
Then Thorne had to make a break for camp
We heard bugle calls shots and he was away without leave
That left the girl with me
I dont know what to do
Thorne swears Casita is no place for Mercedes at night
The girl aint no peon no common Greaser
interrupted Ladd
No
Her name is Castaneda
She belongs to an old Spanish family once rich and influential
Reckoned as much replied the cowboy
Theres more than Rojass wantin to kidnap a pretty girl
Shore he does that every day or so
Must be somethin political or feelin against class
Well Casita aint no place for your friends girl at night or day or any time
Shore theres Americans whod take her in an fight for her if necessary
But it aint wise to risk that
Lash what do you say
Its been gettin hotter round this Greaser corral for some weeks replied the other cowboy
If that twobit of a garrison surrenders theres no tellin whatll happen
Orozco is headin west from Agua Prieta with his guerrillas
Campo is burnin bridges an tearin up the railroad south of Nogales
Then theres all these bandits callin themselves revolutionists just for an excuse to steal burn kill an ride off with women
Its plain facts Laddy an bein across the US line a few inches or so dont make no hell of a difference
My advice is dont let Miss Castaneda ever set foot in Casita again
Looks like youve shore spoke sense said Ladd
I reckon Gale you an the girl ought to come with us
Casita shore would be a little warm for us tomorrow
We didnt kill anybody but I shot a Greasers arm off an Lash strained friendly relations by destroyin property
We know people wholl take care of the senorita till your friend can come for her
Dick warmly spoke his gratefulness and inexpressibly relieved and happy for Mercedes he went toward the clump of cactus where he had left her
She stood erect waiting and dark as it was he could tell she had lost the terror that had so shaken her
Senor Gale you are my good angel she said tremulously
Ive been lucky to fall in with these men and Im glad with all my heart he replied
Come
He led her into the road up to the cowboys who now stood bareheaded in the starlight
The seemed shy and Lash was silent while Ladd made embarrassed unintelligible reply to Mercedesss thanks
There were five horsestwo saddled two packed and the remaining one carried only a blanket
Ladd shortened the stirrups on his mount and helped Mercedes up into the saddle
From the way she settled herself and took the few restive prances of the mettlesome horse Gale judged that she could ride
Lash urged Gale to take his horse
But his Gale refused to do
Ill walk he said
Im used to walking
I know cowboys are not
They tried again to persuade him without avail
Then Ladd started off riding bareback
Mercedes fell in behind with Gale walking beside her
The two pack animals came next and Lash brought up the rear
Once started with protection assured for the girl and a real objective point in view Gale relaxed from the tense strain he had been laboring under
How glad he would have been to acquaint Thorne with their good fortune
Later of course there would be some way to get word to the cavalryman
But till then what torments his friend would suffer
It seemed to Dick that a very long time had elapsed since he stepped off the train and one by one he went over every detail of incident which had occurred between that arrival and the present moment
Strange as the facts were he had no doubts
He realized that before that night he had never known the deeps of wrath undisturbed in him he had never conceived even a passing idea that it was possible for him to try to kill a man
His right hand was swollen stiff so sore that he could scarcely close it
His knuckles were bruised and bleeding and ached with a sharp pain
Considering the thickness of his heavy glove Gale was of the opinion that so to bruise his hand he must have struck Rojas a powerful blow
He remembered that for him to give or take a blow had been nothing
This blow to Rojas however had been a different matter
The hot wrath which had been his motive was not puzzling but the effect on him after he had cooled off a subtle difference something puzzled and eluded him
The more it baffled him the more he pondered
All those wandering months of his had been filled with dissatisfaction yet he had been too apathetic to understand himself
So he had not been much of a person to try Perhaps it had not been the blow to Rojas any more than other things that had wrought some change in him
His meeting with Thorne the wonderful black eyes of a Spanish girl her appeal to him the hate inspired by Rojas and the rush the blow the action sight of Thorne and Mercedes hurrying safely away the girls hand pressing his to her heaving breast the sweet fire of her kiss the fact of her being alone with him dependent upon him all these things Gale turned over and over in his mind only to fail of any definite conclusion as to which had affect him so remarkably or to tell what had really happened to him
Had he fallen in love with Thornes sweetheart
The idea came in a flash
Was he all in an instant and by one of those incomprehensible reversals of character jealous of his friend
Dick was almost afraid to look up at Mercedes
Still he forced himself to do so and as it chanced Mercedes was looking down at him
Somehow the light was better and he clearly saw her white face her black and starry eyes her perfect mouth
With a quick graceful impulsiveness she put her hand upon his shoulder
Like her appearance the action was new strange striking to Gale but it brought home suddenly to him the nature of gratitude and affection in a girl of her blood
It was sweet and sisterly
He knew then that he had not fallen in love with her
The feeling that was akin to jealousy seemed to be of the beautiful something for which Mercedes stood in Thornes life
Gale then grasped the bewildering possibilities the infinite wonder of what a girl could mean to a man
The other haunting intimations of change seemed to be elusively blended with sensationsthe heat and thrill of action the sense of something done and more to do the utter vanishing of an old weary hunt for he knew not what
Maybe it had been a hunt for work for energy for spirit for love for his real self
Whatever it might be there appeared to be now some hope of finding it
The desert began to lighten
Gray openings in the border of shrubby growths changed to paler hue
The road could be seen some rods ahead and it had become a stony descent down steadily down
Dark ridged backs of mountains bounded the horizon and all seemed near at hand hemming in the plain
In the east a white glow grew brighter and brighter reaching up to a line of cloud defined sharply below by a rugged notched range
Presently a silver circle rose behind the black mountain and the gloom of the desert underwent a transformation
From a gray mantle it changed to a transparent haze
The moon was rising
Senor I am cold said Mercedes
Dick had been carrying his coat upon his arm
He had felt warm even hot and had imagined that the steady walk had occasioned it
But his skin was cool
The heat came from an inward burning
He stopped the horse and raised the coat up and helped Mercedes put it on
I should have thought of you he said
But I seemed to feel warm 


The coats a little large we might wrap it round you twice
Mercedes smiled and lightly thanked him in Spanish
The flash of mood was in direct contrast to the appealing passionate and tragic states in which he had successively viewed her and it gave him a vivid impression of what vivacity and charm she might possess under happy conditions
He was about to start when he observed that Ladd had halted and was peering ahead in evident caution
Mercedes horse began to stamp impatiently raised his hears and head and acted as if he was about to neigh
A warning hist
from Ladd bade Dick to put a quieting hand on the horse
Lash came noiselessly forward to join his companion
The two then listened and watched
An uneasy yet thrilling stir ran through Gales veins
This scene was not fancy
These men of the ranges had heard or seen or scented danger
It was all real as tangible and sure as the touch of Mercedess hand upon his arm
Probably for her the night had terrors beyond Gales power to comprehend
He looked down into the desert and would have felt no surprise at anything hidden away among the bristling cactus the dark winding arroyos the shadowed rocks with their moonlit tips the ragged plain leading to the black bold mountains
The wind appeared to blow softly with an almost imperceptible moan over the desert
That was a new sound to Gale
But he heard nothing more
Presently Lash went to the rear and Ladd started ahead
The progress now however was considerably slower not owing to a roadfor that became betterbut probably owing to caution exercised by the cowboy guide
At the end of a half hour this marked deliberation changed and the horses followed Ladds at a gait that put Gale to his best walkingpaces
Meanwhile the moon soared high above the black corrugated peaks
The gray the gloom the shadow whitened
The clearing of the dark foreground appeared to lift a distant veil and show endless aisles of desert reaching down between dim horizonbounding ranges
Gale gazed abroad knowing that as this night was the first time for him to awake to consciousness of a vague wonderful other self so it was one wherein he began to be aware of an encroaching presence of physical thingsthe immensity of the starstudded sky the soaring moon the bleak mysterious mountains and limitless slope and plain and ridge and valley
These things in all their magnificence had not been unnoticed by him before only now they spoke a different meaning
A voice that he had never heard called him to see to fee the vast hard externals of heaven and earth all that represented the open the free silence and solitude and space
Once more his thoughts like his steps were halted by Ladds actions
The cowboy reined in his horse listened a moment then swung down out of the saddle
He raised a cautioning hand to the others then slipped into the gloom and disappeared
Gale marked that the halt had been made in a ridged and cutup pass between low mesas
He could see the columns of cactus standing out black against the moonwhite sky
The horses were evidently tiring for the showed no impatience
Gale heard their panting breaths and also the bark of some animala dog or a coyote
It sounded like a dog and this led Gale to wonder if there was any house near at hand
To the right up under the ledges some distance away stood two square black objects too uniform he thought to be rocks
While he was peering at them uncertain what to think the shrill whistle of a horse pealed out to be followed by the rattling of hoofs on hard stone
Then a dog barked
At the same moment that Ladd hurriedly appeared in the road a light shone out and danced before one of the square black objects
Keep close an dont make no noise he whispered and led his horse at right angles off the road
Gale followed leading Mercedess horse
As he turned he observed that Lash also had dismounted
To keep closely at Ladds heels without brushing the cactus or stumbling over rocks and depressions was a task Gale found impossible
After he had been stabbed several times by the bayonetlike spikes which seemed invisible the matter of caution became equally one of selfpreservation
Both the cowboys Dick had observed wore leather chaps
It was no easy matter to lead a spirited horse through the dark winding lanes walled by thorns
Mercedes horse often balked and had to be coaxed and carefully guided
Dick concluded that Ladd was making a wide detour
The position of certain stars grown familiar during the march veered round from one side to another
Dick saw that the travel was fast but by no means noiseless
The pack animals at times crashed and ripped through the narrow places
It seemed to Gale that any one within a mile could have heard these sounds
From the tops of knolls or ridges he looked back trying to locate the mesas where the light had danced and the dog had barked alarm
He could not distinguish these two rocky eminences from among many rising in the background
Presently Ladd let out into a wider lane that appeared to run straight
The cowboy mounted his horse and this fact convinced Gale that they had circled back to the road
The march proceeded then once more at a good steady silent walk
When Dick consulted his watch he was amazed to see that the hour was till early
How much had happened in little time
He now began to be aware that the night was growing colder and strange to him he felt something damp that in a country he knew he would have recognized as dew
He had not been aware there was dew on the desert
The wind blew stronger the stars shone whiter the sky grew darker and the moon climbed toward the zenith
The road stretched level for miles then crossed arroyos and ridges wound between mounds of broken ruined rock found a level again and then began a long ascent
Dick asked Mercedes if she was cold and she answered that she was speaking especially of her feet which were growing numb
Then she asked to be helped down to walk awhile
At first she was cold and lame and accepted the helping hand Dick proffered
After a little however she recovered and went on without assistance
Dick could scarcely believe his eyes as from time to time he stole a sidelong glance at this silent girl who walked with lithe and rapid stride
She was wrapped in his long coat yet it did not hide her slender grace
He could not see her face which was concealed by the black mantle
A lowspoken word from Ladd recalled Gale to the question of surroundings and of possible dangers
Ladd had halted a few yards ahead
They had reached the summit of what was evidently a high ridge which sloped with much greater steepness on the far side
It was only after a few more forward steps however that Dick could see down the slope
Then full in view flashed a bright campfire around which clustered a group of dark figures
They were encamped in a wide arroyo where horses could be seen grazing in black patches of grass between clusters of trees
A second look at the campers told Gale they were Mexicans
At this moment Lash came forward to join Ladd and the two spend a long uninterrupted moment studying the arroyo
A hoarse laugh faint yet distinct floated up on the cool wind
Well Laddy whatre you makin of that outfit
inquired Lash speaking softly
Same as any of them raider outfits replied Ladd
Theyre across the line for beef
But theyll run off any good stock
As hoss thieves these rebels have got em all beat
That outfit is waitin till its late
Theres a ranch up the arroyo
Gale heard the first speaker curse under his breath
Shore I feel the same said Ladd
But weve got a girl an the young man to look after not to mention our pack outfit
An were huntin for a job not a fight old hoss
Keep on your chaps
Nothin to it but head south for the Rio Forlorn
Youre talkin sense now Jim
I wish wed headed that way long ago
But it aint strange Id want to travel away from the border thinkin of the girl
Jim we cant go round this Greaser outfit an strike the road again
Too rough
So well have to give up gettin to San Felipe
Perhaps its just as well Laddy
Rio Forlorn is on the border line but its country where these rebels aint been yet
Wait till they learn of the oasis an Beldins hosses
exclaimed Laddy
Im not anticipatin peace anywhere along the border Jim
but we cant go ahead we cant go back
Whatll we do Laddy Its a hike to Beldins ranch
An if we get there in daylight some Greaser will see the girl before Beldin can hide her
Itll get talked about
The newsll travel to Casita like sage balls before the wind
Shore we wont ride into Rio Forlorn in the daytime
Lets slip the packs Jim
We can hid them off in the cactus an come back after them
With the young man ridin we The whispering was interrupted by a loud ringing neigh that whistled up from the arroyo
One of the horses had scented the travelers on the ridge top
The indifference of the Mexicans changed to attention
Ladd and Lash turned back and led the horses into the first opening on the south side of the road
There was nothing more said at the moment and manifestly the cowboys were in a hurry
Gale had to run in the open places to keep up
When they did stop it was welcome to Gale for he had begun to fall behind
The packs were slipped securely tied and hidden in a mesquite clump
Ladd strapped a blanket around one of the horses
His next move was to take off his chaps
Gale youre wearin boots an by liftin your feet you can beat the cactus he whispered
But thetheMiss Castaneda shell be torn all to pieces unless she puts these on
Please tell heran hurry
Dick took the caps and going up to Mercedes he explained the situation
She laughed evidently at his embarrassed earnestness and slipped out of the saddle
Senor chapparejos and I are not strangers she said
Deftly and promptly she equipped herself and then Gale helped her into the saddle called to her horse and started off
Lash directed Gale to mount the other saddled horse and go next
Dick had not ridden a hundred yards behind the trotting leaders before he had sundry painful encounters with reaching cactus arms
The horse missed these by a narrow margin
Dicks knees appeared to be in line and it be came necessary for him to lift them high and let his boots take the onslaught of the spikes
He was at home in the saddle and the accomplishment was about the only one he possessed that had been of any advantage during his sojourn in the West
Ladd pursued a zigzag course southward across the desert trotting down the aisles cantering in wide bare patches walking through the clumps of cacti
The desert seemed all of a sameness to Dicka wilderness of rocks and jagged growths hemmed in by lowering ranges always looking close yet never growing any nearer
The moon slanted back toward the west losing its white radiance and the gloom of the earlier evening began to creep into the washes and to darken under the mesas
By and by Ladd entered an arroyo and here the travelers turned and twisted with the meanderings of a dry stream bed
At the head of a canyon they had to take once more to the rougher ground
Always it led down always it grew rougher more rolling with wider bare spaces always the black ranges loomed close
Gale became chilled to the bone and his clothes were damp and cold
His knees smarted from the wounds of the poisoned thorns and his right hand was either swollen stiff or too numb to move
Moreover he was tiring
The excitement the long walk the miles on miles of jolting trotthese had wearied him
Mercedes must be made of steel he thought to stand all that she had been subjected to and yet when the stars were paling and dawn perhaps not far away stay in the saddle
So Dick Gale rode on drowsier for each mile and more and more giving the horse a choice of ground
Sometimes a prod from a murderous spine roused Dick
A grayness had blotted out the waning moon in the west and the clear dark starry sky overhead
Once when Gale thinking to fight his weariness raised his head he saw that one of the horses in the lead was riderless
Ladd was carrying Mercedes
Dick marveled that her collapse had not come sooner
Another time rousing himself again he imagined they were now on a good hard road
It seemed that hours passed though he knew only little time had elapsed when once more he threw off the spell of weariness
He heard a dog bark
Tall trees lined the open lane down which he was riding
Presently in the gray gloom he saw low square houses with flat roofs
Ladd turned off to the left down another lane gloomy between trees
Every few rods there was one of the squat houses
This lane opened into wider lighter space
The cold air bore a sweet perfumewhether of flowers or fruit Dick could not tell
Ladd rode on for perhaps a quarter of a mile though it seemed interminably long to Dick
A grove of trees loomed dark in the gray morning
Ladd entered it and was lost in the shade
Dick rode on among trees
Presently he heard voices and soon another house low and flat like the others but so long he could not see the farther end stood up blacker than the trees
As he dismounted cramped and sore he could scarcely stand
Lash came alongside
He spoke and some one with a big hearty voice replied to him
Then it seemed to Dick that he was led into blackness like pitch where presently he felt blankets thrown on him and then his drowsy faculties faded
IV Forlorn River When Dick opened his eyes a flood of golden sunshine streamed in at the open window under which he lay
His first thought was one of blank wonder as to where in the world he happened to be
The room was large square adobewalled
It was littered with saddles harness blankets
Upon the floor was a bed spread out upon a tarpaulin
Probably this was where some one had slept
The sight of huge dusty spurs a gun belt with sheath and gun and a pair of leather chaps bristling with broken cactus thorns recalled to Dick the cowboys the ride Mercedes and the whole strange adventure that had brought him there
He did not recollect having removed his boots indeed upon second thought he knew he had not done so
But there they stood upon the floor
Ladd and Lash must have taken them off when he was so exhausted and sleepy that he could not tell what was happening
He felt a dead weight of complete lassitude and he did not want to move
A sudden pain in his hand caused him to hold it up
It was black and blue swollen to almost twice its normal size and stiff as a board
The knuckles were skinned and crusted with dry blood
Dick soliloquized that it was the worstlooking hand he had seen since football days and that it would inconvenience him for some time
A warm dry fragrant breeze came through the window
Dick caught again the sweet smell of flowers or fruit
He heard the fluttering of leaves the murmur of running water the twittering of birds then the sound of approaching footsteps and voices
The door at the far end of the room was open
Through it he saw poles of peeled wood upholding a porch roof a bench rose bushes in bloom grass and beyond these brightgreen foliage of trees
He shore was sleepin when I looked in an hour ago said a voice that Kick recognized as Ladds
Let him sleep came the reply in deep goodnatured tones
Mrs b says the girls never moved
Must have been a tough ride for them both
Forty miles through cactus
Young Gale hoofed darn near half the way replied Ladd
We tried to make him ride one of our hosses
If we had wed never got here
A walk like thatd killed me an Jim
Well Laddy Im right down glad to see you boys and Ill do all I can for the young couple said the other
But Im doing some worry here dont mistake me
About your stock
Ive got only a few head of cattle at the oasis now Im worrying some mostly about my horses
The U S is doing some worrying too dont mistake me
The rebel have worked west and north as far as Casita
There are no cavalrymen along the line beyond Casita and there cant be
Its practically waterless desert
But these rebels are desert men
They could cross the line beyond the Rio Forlorn and smuggle arms into Mexico
Of course my job is to keep tab on Chinese and Japs trying to get into the US from Magdalena Bay
But Im supposed to patrol the border line
Im going to hire some rangers
Now Im not so afraid of being shot up though out in this lonely place theres danger of it what Im afraid of most is losing that bunch of horses
If any rebels come this far or if they ever hear of my horses theyre going to raid me
You know what those guerrilla Mexicans will do for horses
Theyre crazy on horse flesh
They know fine horses
They breed the finest in the world
So I dont sleep nights any more
Reckon me an Jim might as well tie up with your for a spell Beldin
Weve been ridin up an down Arizona tryin to keep out of sight of wire fences
Laddy its open enough around Forlorn River to satisfy even an oldtime cowpuncher like you laughed Belding
Id take your staying on as some favor dont mistake me
Perhaps I can persuade the young man Gale to take a job with me
Thats shore likely
He said he had no money no friends
An if a scrappers all youre lookin for hell do replied Ladd with a dry chuckle
Mrs B will throw some broncho capers round this ranch when she hears Im going to hire a stranger
Why
Well theres Nell And you said this Gale was a young American
My wife will be scared to death for fear Nell will fall in love with him
Laddy choked off a laugh then evidently slapped his knee or Beldings for there was a resounding smack
Hes a finespoken goodlooking chap you said
went on Belding
Shore he is said Laddy warmly
What do you say Jim
By this time Dick Gales ears began to burn and he was trying to make himself deaf when he wanted to hear every little word
Husky young fellow nice voice steady clear eyes kinda proud I thought an some handsome he was replied Jim Lash
Maybe I ought to think twice before taking a stranger into my family said Belding seriously
Well I guess hes all right Laddy being the cavalrymans friend
No bum or lunger
He must be all right
Bum
Lunger
Say didnt I tell you I shook hands with this boy an was plumb glad to meet him
demanded Laddy with considerable heat
Manifestly he had been affronted
Tom Beldin hes a gentleman an he could lick you in in half a second
How about that Jim
Less time replied Lash
Tom heres my stand
Young Gale can have my hoss my gun anythin of mine
Aw I didnt mean to insult you boys dont mistake me said Belding
Course hes all right
The object of this conversation lay quiet upon his bed thrilling and amazed at being so championed by the cowboys delighted with Beldings idea of employing him and much amused with the quaint seriousness of the three
Hows the young man
called a womans voice
It was kind and mellow and earnest
Gale heard footsteps on flagstones
Hes asleep yet wife replied Belding
Guess he was pretty much knocked outIll close the door there so we wont wake him
There were slow soft steps then the door softly closed
But the fact scarcely made a perceptible difference in the sound of the voices outside
Laddy and Jim are going to stay went on Belding
Itll be like the old Panhandle days a little
Im powerful glad to have the boys Nellie
You know I meant to sent to Casita to ask them
Well see some trouble before the revolution is ended
I think Ill make this young man Gale an offer
He isnt a cowboy
asked Mrs Belding quickly
No
Shore hed make a darn good one put in Laddy
What is he
Who is he
Where did he come from
Surely you must be Laddy swears hes all right interrupted the husband
Thats enough reference for me
Isnt it enough for you
Humph
Laddy knows a lot about young men now doesnt he especially strangers from the EastTom you must be careful
Wife Im only too glad to have a nervy young chap come along
What sense is there in your objection if Jim and Laddy stick up for him
But Tomhell fall in love with Nell
protested Mrs Belding
Well wouldnt that be regular
Doesnt every man who comes along fall in love with Nell
Hasnt it always happened
When she was a schoolgirl in Kansas didnt it happen
Didnt she have a hundred mooneyed ninnies after her in Texas
Ive had some peace out here in the desert except when a Greaser or a prospector or a Yaqui would come along
Then same old story in love with Nell
But Tom Nell might fall in love with this young man
exclaimed the wife in distress
Laddy Jim didnt I tell you
cried Belding
I knew shed say thatMy dear wife I would be simply overcome with joy if Nell did fall in love once
Real good and hard
Shes wilder than any antelope out there on the desert
Nells nearly twenty now and so far as we know shes never cared a rap for any fellow
And shes just as gay and full of the devil as she was at fourteen
Nells as good and lovable as she is pretty but Im afraid shell never grow into a woman while we live out in this lonely land
And youve always hated towns where there was a chance for the girljust because you were afraid shed fall in love
Youve always been strange even silly about that
Ive done my best for Nellloved her as if she were my own daughter
Ive changed many business plans to suit your whims
There are rough times ahead maybe
I need men
Ill hire this chap Gale if hell stay
Let Nell take her chance with him just as shell have to take chances with men when we get out of the desert
Shell be all the better for it
I hope Laddys not mistaken in his opinion of this newcomer replied Mrs Belding with a sigh of resignation
Shore I never made a mistake in my life figgern people said Laddy stoutly
Yes you have Laddy replied Mrs Belding
Youre wrong about TomWell supper is to be got
That young man and the girl will be starved
Ill go in now
If Nell happens around dontdont flatter her Laddy like you did at dinner
Dont make her think of her looks
Dick heard Mrs Belding walk away
Shore shes powerful particular about that girl observed Laddy
Say Tom Nell knows shes pretty doesnt she
Shes liable to find it out unless you shut up Laddy
When you visited us out here some weeks ago you kept paying cowboy compliments to her
An its your idea that cowboy compliments are plumb bad for girls
Downright bad Laddy so my wife says
Ill be darned if I believe any girl can be hurt by a little sweet talk
It pleases emBut say Beldin speaking of looks have you got a peek yet at the Spanish girl
Not in the light
Well neither have I in daytime
I had enough by moonlight
Nell is some on looks but Im regretful passin the ribbon to the lady from Mex
Jim where are you
My moneys on Nell replied Lash
Gimme a girl with flesh an color an blue eyes alaughin
Miss Castaneda is some peach Ill not gainsay
But her face seemed too white
An when she flashed those eyes on me I thought I was shot
When she stood up there at first thankin us I felt as if aa princess was round somewhere
Now Nell is kiddish an sweet an Chop it interrupted Belding
Here comes Nell now
Dicks tingling hears took in the pattering of light footsteps the rush of some one running
Here you are cried a sweet happy voice
Dad the Senorita is perfectly lovely
Ive been peeping at her
She sleeps likelike death
Shes so white
Oh I hope she wont be ill Shore shes only played out said Laddy 
But she had spunk while it lastedI was just arguin with Jim an Tom about Miss Castaneda
Gracious
Why shes beautiful
I never saw any one so beautifulHow strange and sad that about her
Tell me more Laddy
You promised
Im dying to know
I never hear anything in this awful place
Didnt you say the Senorita had a sweetheart
Shore I did
And hes a cavalryman
Yes
Is he the young man who came with you
Nope
That fellows the one who saved the girl from Rojas
Ah
Where is he Laddy
Hes in there asleep
Is he hurt
I reckon not
He walked about fifteen miles
Is henice Laddy
Shore
What is he like
Well Im not long acquainted never say him by day but I was some tolerable took with him
An Jim here Jim says the young man can have his gun an his hoss
Wonderful
Laddy what on earth did this stranger do to win you cowboys in just one night
Ill shore have to tell you
Me an Jim were watchin a game of cards in the Del Sol saloon in Casita
Thats across the line
We had acquaintancesfour fellows from the Cross Bar outfit where we worked a while back
This Del Sol is a billiard hall saloon restaurant an the like
An it was full of Greasers
Some of Camps rebels were there drinkin an playin games
Then pretty soon in come Rojas with some of his outfit
They were packin guns an kept to themselves off to one side
I didnt give them a second look till Jim said he reckoned there was somethin in the wind
Then carelesslike I began to peek at Rojas
They call Rojas the dandy rebel an he shore looked the part
It made me sick to see him in all that lace an glitter knowin him to be the cutthroat robber he is
Its no oncommon sight to see excited Greasers
Theyre all crazy
But this bandit was shore some agitated
He kept his men in a tight bunch round a table
He talked an waved his hands
He was actually shakin
His eyes had a wild glare
Now I figgered that trouble was brewin most likely for the little Casita garrison
People seemed to think Campo an Rojas would join forces to oust the federals
Jim thought Rojass excitement was at the hatchin of some plot
Anyway we didnt join no card games an without pretendin to we was some watchful
A little while afterward I seen a fellow standin in the restaurant door
He was a young American dressed in corduroys and boots like a prospector
You know its no onusual fact to see prospectors in these parts
What made me think twice about this one was how big he seemed how he filled up that door
He looked round the saloon an when he spotted Rojas he sorta jerked up
Then he pulled his slouch hat lopsided an began to stagger down down the steps
First off I mad shore he was drunk
But I remembered he didnt seem drunk before
It was some queer
So I watched that young man
He reeled around the room like a fellow who was drunkern a lord
Nobody but me seemed to notice him
Then he began to stumble over poolplayers an get his fact tangled up in chairs an bump against tables
He got some pretty hard looks
He came round our way an all of a sudden he seen us cowboys
He gave another start like the one when he first seen Rojas then he made for us
I tipped Jim off that somethin was doin
When he got close he straightened up put back his slouch hat an looked at us
Then I saw his face
It sorta electrified yours truly
It was white with veins standin out an eyes flamina face of fury
I was plumb amazed didnt know what to think
Then this queer young man shot some cool polite words at me an Jim
He was only bluffin at bein drunkhe meant to rush Rojas to start a rough house
Then bandit was after a girl
This girl was in the hotel an she was the sweetheart of a soldier the young fellows friend
The hotel was watched by Rojass guards an the plan was to make a fuss an get the girl away in the excitement
Well Jim an me got a hint of our bein Americansthat cowboys generally had a name for loyalty to women
Then this amazin chapyou cant imagine how scornfulsaid for me an Jim to watch him
Before I could catch my breath an figger out what he meant by rush an rough house he had knocked over a table an crowded some Greaser half off the map
One little funny man leaped up like a wild monkey an began to screech
An in another second he was in the air upside down
When he lit he laid there
Then quickern I can tell you the young man dove at Rojas
Like a mad steer on the rampage he charged Rojas an his men
The whole outfit went downsmash
I figgered then what rush meant
The young fellow came up out of the pile with Rojas an just like Id sling an empty sack along the floor he sent the bandit
But swift as that went he was on top of Rojas before the chairs an tables had stopped rollin
I woke up then an made for the center of the room
Jim with me
I began to shoot out the lamps
Jim throwed his guns on the crazy rebels an I was afraid thered be blood spilled before I could get the room dark
Beins shore busy I lost sight of the young fellow for a second or so an when I got an eye free for him I seen a Greaser about to knife him
Think I was some considerate of the Greaser by only shootin his arm off
Then I cracked the last lamp an in the hullabaloo me an Jim vamoosed
We made tracks for our hosses an packs an was hittin the San Felipe road when we run right plumb into the young man
Well he said his name was GaleDick Gale
The girl was with him safe an well but her sweetheart the soldier bein away without leave had to go back sudden
There shore was some trouble for Jim an me heard shootin
Gale said he had no money no friends was a stranger in a desert country an he was distracted to know how to help the girl
So me an Jim started off with them for San Felipe got switched and then we headed for the Rio Forlorn
Oh I think he was perfectly splendid
exclaimed the girl
Shore he was
Only Nell you cant lay no claim to bein the original discoverer of that fact
But Laddy you havent told me what he looks like
At this juncture Dick Gale felt is absolutely impossible for him to play the eavesdropper any longer
Quietly he rolled out of bed
The voices still sounded close outside and it was only by effort that he kept from further listening
Beldings kindly interest Laddys blunt and sincere cowboy eulogy the girls sweet eagerness and praisethese warmed Gales heart
He had fallen among simple people into whose lives the advent of an unknown man was welcome
He found himself in a singularly agitated mood
The excitement the thrill the difference felt in himself experienced the preceding night had extended on into his present
And the possibilities suggested by the conversation he had unwittingly overheard added sufficiently to the other feelings to put him into a peculiarly receptive state of mind
He was wild to be one of the Beldings rangers
The idea of riding a horse in the open desert with a dangerous duty to perform seemed to strike him with an appealing force
Something within him went out to the cowboys to this blunt and kind Belding
He was afraid to meet the girl
If every man who came along fell in love with this sweetvoiced Nell then what hope had he to escapenow when his whole inner awakening betokened a change of spirit hope a finding of real worth real good real power in himself
He did not understand wholly yet he felt ready to ride to fight to love the desert to love these outdoor men to love a woman
That beautiful Spanish girl had spoken to something dead in him and it had quickened to life
The sweet voice of an audacious unseen girl warned him that presently a still more wonderful thing would happen to him
Gale imagined he made noise enough as he clumsily pulled on his boots yet the voices split by a merry laugh kept on murmuring outside the door
It was awkward for him having only one hand available to lace up his boots
He looked out of the window
Evidently this was at the end of the house
There was a flagstone walk beside which ran a ditch full of swift muddy water
It made a pleasant sound
There were trees strange of form and color to to him
He heard bees birds chickens saw the red of roses and green of grass
Then he saw close to the wall a tub full of water and a bench upon which lay basin soap towel comb and brush
The window was also a door for under it there was a step
Gale hesitated a moment then went out
He stepped naturally hoping and expecting that the cowboys would hear him
But nobody came
Awkwardly with left hand he washed his face
Upon a nail in the wall hung a little mirror by the aid of which Dick combed and brushed his hair
He imagined he looked a most haggard wretch
With that he faced forward meaning to go round the corner of the house to greet the cowboys and these newfound friends
Dick had taken but one step when he was halted by laugher and the patter of light feet
From close around the corner pealed out that sweet voice
Dad youll have your wish and mama will be wild
Dick was a little foot sweep into view a white dress then the swiftly moving form of a girl
She was looking backward
Dad I shall fall in love with your new ranger
I willI have Then she plumped squarely into Dicks arms
She started back violently
Dick saw a fair face and darkblue audaciously flashing eyes
Swift as lightning their expression changed to surprise fear wonder
for an instant they were level with Dicks grave questioning
Suddenly sweetly she blushed
Ohh
she faltered
Then the blush turned to a scarlet fire
She whirled past him and like a white gleam was gone
Dick became conscious of the quickened beating of his heart
He experienced a singular exhilaration
That moment had been the one for which he had been ripe the event upon which strange circumstances had been rushing him
With a couple of strides he turned the corner
Laddy and Lash were there talking to a man of burly form
Seen by day both cowboys were grayhaired redskinned and weatherbeaten with lean sharp features and gray eyes so much alike that they might have been brothers
Hello theres the young fellow spoke up the burly man
Mr Gale Im glad to meet you
My names Belding
His greeting was as warm as his handclasp was long and hard
Gale saw a heavy man of medium height
His head was large and covered with grizzled locks
He wore a shortcropped mustache and chin beard
His skin was brown and his dark eyes beamed with a genial light
The cowboys were as cordial as if Dick had been their friend for years
Young man did you run into anything as you cam out
asked Belding with twinkling eyes
Why yes I met something white and swift flying by replied Dick
Did she see you
asked Laddy
I think so but she didnt wait for me to introduce myself
That was Nell Burton my girlstepdaughter I should say said Belding
Shes sure some whirlwind as Laddy calls her
Come lets go in and meet the wife
The house was long like a barracks with porch extending all the way and doors every dozen paces
When Dick was ushered into a sittingroom he was amazed at the light and comfort
This room had two big windows and a door opening into a patio where there were luxuriant grass roses in bloom and flowering trees
He heard a slow splashing of water
In Mrs Belding Gale found a woman of noble proportions and striking appearance
Her hair was white
She had a strong serious welllined face that bore haunting evidences of past beauty
The gaze she bent upon him was almost piercing in its intensity
Her greeting which seemed to Dick rather slow in coming was kind though not cordial
Gales first thought after he had thanked these good people for their hospitality was to inquire about Mercedes
He was informed that the Spanish girl had awakened with a considerable fever and nervousness
When however her anxiety had been allayed and her thirst relieved she had fallen asleep again
Mrs Belding said the girl had suffered no great hardship other than mental and would very soon be rested and well
Now Gale said Belding when his wife had excused herself to get supper the boys Jim and Laddy told me about you and the mixup at Casita
Ill be glad to take care of the girl till its safe for your soldier friend to get her out of the country
That wont be very soon dont mistake meI dont want to seem overcurious about youLaddy has interested me in youand straight out Id like to know what you propose to do now
I havent any plans replied Dick and taking the moment as propitious he decided to speak frankly concerning himself
I just drifted down here
My home is in Chicago
When I left school some years agoIm twentyfive nowI went to work for my father
Heshe has business interests there
I tried all kinds of inside jobs
I couldnt please my father
I guess I put no real heart in my work
the fact was I didnt know how to work
The governor and I didnt exactly quarrel but he hurt my feelings and I quit
Six months or more ago I came West and have knocked about from Wyoming southwest to the border
I tried to find congenial work but nothing came my way
To tell you frankly Mr Belding I suppose I didnt much care
I believe though that all the time I didnt know what I wanted
Ive learnedwell just lately What do you want to do
interposed Belding
I want a mans job
I want to do things with my hands
I want action
I want to be outdoors
Belding nodded his head as if he understood that and he began to speak again cut something short then went on hesitatingly Galeyou could go home againto the old man itd be all right
Mr Belding theres nothing shady in my past
The governor would be glad to have me home
Thats the only consolation Ive got
But Im not going
Im broke
I wont be a tramp
And its up to me to do something
Howd you like to be a border ranger
asked Belding laying a hand on Dicks knee
Part of my job here is United States Inspector of Immigration
Ive got that boundary line to patrolto keep out Chinks and Japs
This revolution has added complications and Im looking for smugglers and raiders here any day
Youll not be hired by the U S Youll simply be my ranger same as Laddy and Jim who have promised to work for me
Ill pay you well give you a room here furnish everything down to guns and the finest horse you ever saw in your life
Your job wont be safe and healthy sometimes but itll be a mans jobdont mistake me
You can gamble on having things to do outdoors
Now what do you say
I accpet and I thank youI cant say how much replied Gale earnestly
Good
Thats settled
Lets go out and tell Laddy and Jim
Both boys expressed satisfaction at the turn of affairs and then with Belding they set out to take Gale around the ranch
The house and several outbuildings were constructed of adobe which according to Belding retained the summer heat on into winter and the winter cold on into summer
These grayred mud habitations were hideous to look at and this fact perhaps made their really comfortable interiors more vividly a contrast
The wide grounds were covered with luxuriant grass and flowers and different kinds of trees
Gales interest led him to ask about fig trees and pomegranates and especially about a beautiful specimen that Belding called palo verde
Belding explained that the luxuriance of this desert place was owing to a few springs and the dammedup waters of the Rio Forlorn
Before he had come to the oasis it had been inhabited by a Papago Indian tribe and a few peon families
The oasis lay in an arroyo a mile wide and sloped southwest for some ten miles or more
The river went dry most of the year but enough water was stored in flood season to irrigate the gardens and alfalfa fields
Ive got one neverfailing spring on my place said Belding
Fine sweet water
You know what that means in the desert
I like this oasis
The longer I live here the better I like it
Theres not a spot in southern Arizona thatll compare with this valley for water or grass or wood
Its beautiful and healthy
Forlorn and lonely yes especially for women like my wife and Nell but I like itAnd between you and me boys Ive got something up my sleeve
Theres gold dust in the arroyos and theres mineral up in the mountains
If we only had water
This hamlet has steadily grown since I took up a station here
Why Casita is no place beside Forlorn River
Pretty soon the Southern Pacific will shoot a railroad branch out here
There are possibilities and I want you boys to stay with me and get in on the ground floor
I wish this rebel war was overWell here are the corrals and the fields
Gale take a look at that bunch of horses
Beldings last remark was made as he led his companions out of shady gardens into the open
Gale saw an adobe shed and a huge pen fenced by strangely twisted and contorted branches or trunks of mesquite and beyond these wide flat fields greena dark rich greenand dotted with beautiful horses
There were whites and blacks and bays and grays
In his admiration Gale searched his memory to see if he could remember the like of these magnificent animals and had to admit that the only ones he could compare with them were the Arabian steeds
Every ranch loves his horses said Belding
When I was in the Panhandle I had some fine stock
But these are Mexican
They came from Durango where they were bred
Mexican horses are the finest in the world bar none
Shore I reckon I savvy why you dont sleep nights drawled Laddy
I see a Greaser out thereno its an Indian
Thats my Papago herdsman
I keep watch over the horses now day and night
Lord how Id hate to have Rojas or Salazarany of those bandit rebelsfind my horsesGale can you ride
Dick modestly replied that he could according to the Eastern idea of horsemanship
You dont need to be half horse to ride one of that bunch
But over there in the other field Ive ironjawed broncos I wouldnt want you to tackleexcept to see the fun
Ive an outlaw Ill gamble even Laddy cant ride
So
How muchll you gamble
asked Laddy instantly
The ringing of a bell which Belding said was a call to supper turned the men back toward the house
Facing that way Gale saw dark beetling ridges rising from the oasis and leading up to bare black mountains
He had heard Belding call them No Name Mountains and somehow the appellation suited those lofty mysterious frowning peaks
It was not until they reached the house and were about to go in that Belding chanced to discover Gales crippled hand
What an awful hand
he exclaimed
Where the devil did you get that
I stove in my knuckles on Rojas replied Dick
You did that in one punch
Say Im glad it wasnt me you hit
Why didnt you tell me
Thats a bad hand
Those cuts are full of dirt and sand
Inflammations setting in
Its got to be dressed
Nell
he called
There was no answer
He called again louder
Mother wheres the girl
Shes there in the diningroom replied Mrs Belding
Did she hear me
he inquired impatiently
Of course
Nell
roared Belding
This brought results
Dick saw a glimpse of golden hair and a white dress in the door
But they were not visible longer than a second
Dad whats the matter
asked a voice that was still as sweet as formerly but now rather small and constrained
Bring the antiseptics cotton bandagesand things out here
Hurry now
Belding fetched a pail of water and a basin from the kitchen
His wife followed him out and upon seeing Dicks hand was all solicitude
Then Dick heard light quick footsteps but he did not look up
Nell this is Mr GallDick Gale who came with the boys last last night said Belding
Hes got an awful hand
Got it punching that greaser Rojas
I want you to dress itGale this is my stepdaughter Nell Burton of whom I spoke
Shes some good when theres somebody sick or hurt
Shove out your fist my boy and let her get at it
Suppers nearly ready
Dick felt that same strange quickening heart throb yet he had never been cooler in his life
More than anything else in the world he wanted to look at Nell Burton however divining that the situation might be embarrassing to her he refrained from looking up
She began to bathe his injured knuckles
He noted the softness the deftness of her touch and then it seemed her fingers were not quite as steady as they might have been
Still in a moment they appeared to become surer in their work
She had beautiful hands not too large though certainly not small and they were strong brown supple
He observed next with stealthy upwardstealing glance that she had rolled up her sleeves exposing fine round arms graceful in line
Her skin was brownno it was more gold than brown
It had a wonderful clear tint
Dick stoically lowered his eyes then putting off as long as possible the alluring moment when he was to look into her face
That would be a fateful moment
He played with a certain strange joy of anticipation
When however she sat down beside him and rested his injured hand in her lap as she cut bandages she was so thrillingly near that he yielded to an irrepressible desire to look up
She had a sweet fair face warmly tinted with that same healthy goldenbrown sunburn
Her hair was light gold and abundant a waving mass
Her eyes were shaded by long downcast lashes yet through them he caught a gleam of blue
Despite the stir within him Gale seeing she was now absorbed in her task critically studied her with a second closer gaze
She was a sweet wholesome joyous pretty girl
Shore it musta hurt
replied Laddy who sat an interested spectator
Yes I confess it did replied Dick slowly with his eyes on Nells face
But I didnt mind
The girls lashes swept up swiftly in surprise
She had taken his words literally
But the darkblue eyes met his for only a fleeting second
Then the warm tint in her cheeks turned as red as her lips
Hurriedly she finished tying the bandage and rose to her feet
I thank you said Gale also rising
With that Belding appeared in the doorway and finding the operation concluded called them in to supper
Dick had the use of only one arm and he certainly was keenly aware of the shy silent girl across the table but in spite of these considerable handicaps he eclipsed both hungry cowboys in the assault upon Mrs Beldings bounteous supper
Belding talked the cowboys talked more or less
Mrs Belding put in a word now and then and Dick managed to find brief intervals when it was possible for him to say yes or no
He observed gratefully that no one round the table seemed to be aware of his enormous appetite
After supper having a favorable opportunity when for a moment no one was at hand Dick went out through the yard past the gardens and fields and climbed the first knoll
From that vantage point he looked out over the little hamlet somewhat to his right and was surprised at its extent its considerable number of adobe houses
The overhanging mountains ragged and darkening a great heave of splintered rock rather chilled and affronted him
Westward the setting sun gilded a spiked frostcolored limitless expanse of desert
It awed Gale
Everywhere rose blunt broken ranges or isolated groups of mountains
Yet the desert stretched away down between and beyond them
When the sun set and Gale could not see so far he felt a relief
That grand and austere attraction of distance gone he saw the desert nearer at handthe valley at his feet
What a strange gray somber place
There was a lighter strip of gray winding down between darker hues
This he realized presently was the river bed and he saw how the pools of water narrowed and diminished in size till they lost themselves in gray sand
This was the rainy season near its end and here a little river struggled hopelessly forlornly to live in the desert
He received a potent impression of the nature of that blasted ageworn waste which he had divined was to give him strength and work and love
V A Desert Rose Belding assigned Dick to a little room which had no windows but two doors one opening into the patio the other into the yard on the west side of the house
It contained only the barest necessities for comfort
Dick mentioned the baggage he had left in the hotel at Casita and it was Beldings opinion that to try to recover his property would be rather risky on the moment Richard Gale was probably not popular with the Mexicans at Casita
So Dick bade goodby to fine suits of clothes and linen with a feeling that as he had said farewell to an idle and useless past it was just as well not to have any old luxuries as reminders
As he possessed however not a thing save the clothes on his back and not even a handkerchief he expressed regret that he had come to Forlorn River a beggar
Beggar hell
exploded Belding with his eyes snapping in the lamplight
Moneys the last thing we think of out here
All the same Gale if you stick youll be rich
It wouldnt surprise me replied Dick thoughtfully
But he was not thinking of material wealth
Then as he viewed his stained and torn shirt he laughed and said Belding while Im getting rich Id like to have some respectable clothes
Weve a little Mex store in town and what you cant get there the women folks will make for you
When Dick lay down he was dully conscious of pain and headache that he did not feel well
Despite this and a mind thronging with memories and anticipations he succumbed to weariness and soon fell asleep
It was light when he awoke but a strange brightness seen through what seemed blurred eyes
A moment passed before his mind worked clearly and then he had to make an effort to think
He was dizzy
When he essayed to lift his right arm an excruciating pain made him desist
Then he discovered that his arm was badly swollen and the hand had burst its bandages
The injured member was red angry inflamed and twice its normal size
He felt hot all over and a raging headache consumed him
Belding came stamping into the room
Hello Dick
Do you know its late
Hows the busted fist this morning
Dick tried to sit up but his effort was a failure
He got about half up then felt himself weakly sliding back
I guessIm pretty sick he said
He saw Belding lean over him feel his face and speak and then everything seemed to drift not into darkness but into some region where he had dim perceptions of gray moving things and of voices that were remote
Then there came an interval when all was blank
He knew not whether it was one of minutes or hours but after it he had a clearer mind
He slept awakened during nighttime and slept again
When he again unclosed his eyes the room was sunny and cool with a fragrant breeze that blew through the open door
Dick felt better but he had no particular desire to move or talk or eat
He had however a burning thirst
Mrs Belding visited him often her husband came in several times and once Nell slipped in noiselessly
Even this last event aroused no interest in Dick
On the next day he was very much improved
Weve been afraid of blood poisoning said Belding
But my wife thinks the dangers past
Youll have to rest that arm for a while
Ladd and Jim came peeping in at the door
Come in boys
He can have companythe more the betterif itll keep him content
He mustnt move thats all
The cowboys entered slow easy cool kindvoiced
Shore its tough said Ladd after he had greeted Dick
You look used up
Jim Lash wagged his halfbald sunburned head Musta been moren tough for Rojas
Gale Laddy tells me one of our neighbors fellow named Carter is going to Casita put in Belding
Heres a chance to get word to your friend the soldier
Oh that will be fine
exclaimed Dick
I declare Id forgotten ThorneHow is Miss Castaneda
I hope Shes all right Gale
Been up and around the patio for two days
Like all the Spanishthe real thingshes made of Damascus steel
Weve been getting acquainted
She and Nell made friends at once
Ill call them in
He closed the door leading out into the yard explaining that he did not want to take chances of Mercedess presence becoming known to neighbors
Then he went to the patio and called
Both girls came in Mercedes leading
Like Nell she wore white and she had a red rose in her hand
Dick would scarcely have recognized anything about her except her eyes and the way she carried her little head and her beauty burst upon him strange and anew
She was swift impulsive in her movements to reach his side
Senor I am so sorry you were illso happy you are better
Dick greeted her offering his left hand gravely apologizing for the fact that owing to a late infirmity he could not offer the right
Her smile exquisitely combined sympathy gratitude admiration
Then Dick spoke to Nell likewise offering his hand which she took shyly
Her reply was a murmured unintelligible one but her eyes were glad and the tine in her cheeks threatened to rival the hue of the rose she carried
Everybody chatted then except Nell who had apparently lost her voice
Presently Dick remembered to speak of the matter of getting news to Thorne
Senor may I write to him
Will some one take a letterI shall hear from him
she said and her white hands emphasized her words
Assuredly
I guess poor Thorne is almost crazy
Ill write to himNo I cant with this crippled hand
Thatll be all right Gale said Belding
Nell will write for you
She writes all my letters
So Belding arranged it and Mercedes flew away to her room to write while Nell fetched pen and paper and seated herself beside Gales bed to take his dictation
What with watching Nell and trying to catch her glance and listening to Beldings talk with the cowboys Dick was hard put to it to dictate any kind of a creditable letter
Nell met his gaze once then no more
The color came and went in her cheeks and sometimes when he told her to write so and so there was a demure smile on her lips
She was laughing at him
And Belding was talking over the risks involved in a trip to Casita
Shore Ill ride in with the letters Ladd said
No you wont replied Belding
That bandit outfit will be laying for you
Well I reckon if they was I wouldnt be oncommon grieved
Ill tell you boys Ill ride in myself with Carter
Theres business I can see to and Im curious to know what the rebels are doing
Laddy keep one eye open while Im gone
See the horses are locked upGale Im going to Casita myself
Ought to get back tomorrow some time
Ill be ready to start in an hour
Have your letter ready
And sayif you want to write home its a chance
Sometimes we dont go to the P O in a month
He tramped out followed by the tall cowboys and then Dick was enabled to bring his letter to a close
Mercedes came back and her eyes were shining
Dick imagined a letter received from her would be something of an event for a fellow
Then remembering Beldings suggestion he decided to profit by it
May I trouble you to write antoher for me
asked Dick as he received the letter from Nell
Its no trouble Im sureId be pleased she replied
That was altogether a wonderful speech of hers Dick thought because the words were the first coherent ones she had spoken to him
May I stay
asked Mercedes smiling
By all means he answered and then he settled back and began
Presently Gale paused partly because of genuine emotion and stole a look from under his hand at Nell
She wrote swiftly and her downcast face seemed to be softer in its expression of sweetness
If she had in the very least been drawn to him But that was absurdimpossible
When Dick finished dictating his eyes were upon Mercedes who sat smiling curious and sympathetic
How responsive she was
He heard the hasty scratch of Nells pen
He looked at Nell
Presently she rose holding out his letter
He was just in time to see a wave of red recede from her face
She gave him one swift gaze unconscious searching then averted it and turned away
She left the room with Mercedes before he could express his thanks
But that strange speaking flash of eyes remained to haunt and torment Gale
It was indescribably sweet and provocative of thoughts that he believed were wild without warrant
Something within him danced for very joy and the next instant he was conscious of wistful doubt a gravity that he could not understand
It dawned upon him that for the brief instant when Nell had met his gaze she had lost her shyness
It was a womans questioning eyes that had pierced through him
During the rest of the day Gale was content to lie still on his bed thinking and dreaming dozing at intervals and watching the lights change upon the mountain peaks feeling the warm fragrant desert wind that blew in upon him
He seemed to have lost the faculty of estimating time
A long while strong in its effect upon him appeared to have passed since he had met Thorne
He accepted things as he felt them and repudiated his intelligence
His old inquisitive habit of mind returned
did he love Nell
Was he only attracted for the moment
What was the use of worrying about her or himself
He refused to answer and deliberately gave himself up to dreams of her sweet face and of that last darkblue glance
Next day he believed he was well enough to leave his room but Mrs Belding would not permit him to do so
She was kind softhanded motherly and she was always coming in to minister to his comfort
This attention was sincere not in the least forced yet Gale felt that the friendliness so manifest in the others of the household did not extend to her
He was conscious of something that a little thought persuaded him was antagonism
It surprised and hurt him
He had never been much of a success with girls and young married women but their mothers and old people had generally been fond of him
Still though Mrs Beldings hair was snowwhite she did not impress him as being old
He reflected that there might come a time when it would be desirable far beyond any ground of everyday friendly kindliness to have Mrs Belding be well disposed toward him
So he thought about her and pondered how to make her like him
It did not take very long for Dick to discover that he liked her
Her face except when she smiled was thoughtful and sad
It was a face to make one serious
Like a haunting shadow like a phantom of happier years the sweetness of Nells face was there and infinitely more of beauty than had been transmitted to the daughter
Dick believed Mrs Beldings friendship and motherly love were worth striving to win entirely aside from any more selfish motive
He decided both would be hard to get
Often he felt her deep penetrating gaze upon him and though this in no wise embarrassed himfor he had no shameful secrets of past or presentit showed him how useless it would be to try to conceal anything from her
Naturally on first impulse he wanted to hide his interest in the daughter but he resolved to be absolutely frank and true and through that win or lose
Moreover if Mrs Belding asked him any questions about his home his family his connections he would not avoid direct and truthful answers
Toward evening Gale heard the tramp of horses and Beldings hearty voice
Presently the rancher strode in upon Gale shaking the gray dust from his broad shoulders and waving a letter
Hello Dick
Good news and bad
he said putting the letter in Dicks hand
Had no trouble finding your friend Thorne
Looked like hed been drunk for a week
Say he nearly threw a fit
I never saw a fellow so wild with joy
He made sure you and Mercedes were lost in the desert
He wrote two letters which I brought
Dont mistake me boy it was some fun with Mercedes just now
I teased her wouldnt give her the letter
You ought to have seen her eyes
If ever you see a blackandwhite desert hawk swoop down upon a quail then youll know how Mercedes pounced upon her letterWell Casita is one hell of a place these days
I tried to get your baggage and I think I made a mistake
Were going to see travel toward Forlorn River
The federal garrison got reinforcements from somewhere and is holding out
Theres been fighting for three days
The rebels have a string of flat railroad cars all iron and they ran this up within range of the barricades
Theyve got some machine guns and theyre going to lick the federals sure
There are dead soldiers in the ditches Mexican noncombatants lying dead in the streetsand buzzards everywhere
Its reported that Campo the rebel leader is on the way up from Sinaloa and Huerta a federal general is coming to relieve the garrison
I dont take much stock in reports
But theres hell in Casita all right
Do you think well have trouble out here
asked Dick excitedly
Sure
Some kind of trouble sooner or later replied Belding gloomily
Why you can stand on my ranch and step over into Mexico
Laddy says well lose horses and other stock in night raids
Jim Lash doesnt look for any worse
But Jim isnt as well acquainted with Greasers as I am
Anyway my boy as soon as you can hold a bridle and a gun youll be on the job dont mistake me
With Laddy and Jim
asked Dick trying to be cool
Sure
With them and me and by yourself
Dick drew a deep breath and even after Belding had departed he forgot for a moment about the letter in his hand
Then he unfolded the paper and read Dear DickYouve more than saved my life
To the end of my days youll be the one man to whom I owe everything
Words fail to express my feelings
This must be a brief note
Belding is waiting and I used up most of the time writing to Mercedes
I like Belding
He was not unknown to me though I never met or saw him before
Youll be interested to learn that hes the unadulterated article the real Western goods
Ive heard of some of his stunts and they made my hair curl
Dick your luck is staggering
The way Belding spoke of you was great
But you deserve it old man
Im leaving Mercedes in your charge subject of course to advice from Belding
Take care of her Dick for my life is wrapped up in her
By all means keep her from being seen by Mexicans
We are sitting tight herenothing doing
If some action doesnt come soon itll be darned strange
Things are centering this way
Theres scrapping right along and people have begun to move
Were still patrolling the line eastward of Casita
Itll be impossible to keep any tab on the line west of Casita for its too rough
That cactus desert is awful
Cowboys or rangers with desertbred horses might keep raiders and smugglers from crossing
But if cavalrymen could stand that waterless wilderness which I doubt much their horses would drop under them
If things do quiet down before my commission expires Ill get leave of absence run out to Forlorn River marry my beautiful Spanish princess and take her to a civilized country where I opine every son of a gun who sees her will lose his head and drive me mad
Its my great luck old pal that you are a fellow who never seemed to care about pretty girls
So you wont give me the double cross and run off with Mercedescarry her off like the villain in the play I mean
That reminds me of Rojas
Oh Dick it was glorious
You didnt do anything to the Dandy Rebel
Not at all
You merely caressed himgently moved him to one side
Dick harken to these glad words Rojas is in the hospital
I was interested to inquire
He had a smashed finger a dislocated collar bone three broken ribs and a fearful gash on his face
Hell be in the hospital for a month
Dick when I meet that pigheaded dad of yours Im going to give him the surprise of his life
Send me a line whenever any one comes in from F R and inclose Mercedess letter in yours
Take care of her Dick and may the future hold in store for you some of the sweetness I know now
Faithfully yours Thorne
Dick reread the letter then folded it and placed it under his pillow
Never cared for pretty girls huh
he soliloquized
George I never saw any till I struck Southern Arizona
Guess Id better make up for lost time
While he was eating his supper with appetite rapidly returning to normal Ladd and Jim cam in bowing their tall heads to enter the door
Their friendly advances were singularly welcome to Gale but he was still backward
He allowed himself to show that he was glad to see them and he listened
Jim Lash had heard from Belding the result of the mauling given to Rojas by Dick
And Jim talked about what a grand thing that was
Ladd had a good deal to say about Beldings horses
It took no keen judge of human nature to see that horses constituted Ladds ruling passion
Ive had wimmen go back on me but never no hoss
declared Ladd and manifestly that was a controlling truth with him
Shore its a cinch Beldin is agoin to lose some of them hosses he said
you can search me if I dont think therell be more doin on the border here than along the Rio Grande
Were just the same as on Greaser soil
Mebbe we dont stand no such chance of bein shot up as we would across the line
but whos goin to give up his hosses without a fight
Half the time when Beldins stock is out of the alfalfa its grazin over the line
He thinks hes careful about them hosses but he aint
Look ahere Laddy you caint believe all you hear replied Jim seriously
I reckon we mightnt have any trouble
Back up Jim
Shore youre standin on your bridle
I aint goin much on reports
Remember that American we met in Casita the prospector whod just gotten out of Sonora
He had some story he had
Swore hed killed seventeen Greasers breakin through the rebel line round the mine where he an other Americans were corralled
The next day when I met him again he was drunk an then he told me hed shot thirty Greasers
The chances are he did kill some
But reports are exaggerated
There are miners fightin for life down in Sonora you can gamble on that
An the truth is bad enough
Take Rojass harryin of the Senorita for instance
Can you beat that
Shore Jim theres more doin than the raidin of a few hosses
An Forlorn River is goin to get hers
Another dawn found Gale so much recovered that he arose and looked after himself not however without considerable difficulty and rather disheartening twinges of pain
Some time during the morning he heard the girls in the patio and called to ask if he might join them
He received one response a mellow Si Senor
It was not as much as he wanted but considering that it was enough he went out
He had not as yet visited the patio and surprise and delight were in store for him
He found himself lost in a labyrinth of green and rosebordered walks
He strolled around discovering that the patio was a courtyard open at an end but he failed to discover the young ladies
So he called again
the answer cam from the center of the square
After stooping to get under shrubs and wading through bushes he entered an open sandy circle full of magnificent and murderous cactus plants strange to him
On the other side in the shade of a beautiful tree he found the girls
Mercedes sitting in a hammock Nell upon a blanket
What a beautiful tree
he exclaimed
I never saw one like that
What is it
Palo verde replied Nell
Senor palo verde means green tree added Mercedes
This desert tree which had struck Dick as so new and strange and beautiful was not striking on account of size for it was small scarcely reaching higher than the roof but rather because of its exquisite color of green trunk and branch alike and owing to the odd fact that it seemed not to possess leaves
All the tree from ground to tiny flat twigs was a soft polished green
It bore no thorns
Right then and there began Dicks education in desert growths and he felt that even if he had not had such charming teachers he would still have been absorbed
For the patio was full of desert wonders
A twistingtrunked tree with full foliage of small gray leaves Nell called a mesquite
Then Dick remembered the name and now he saw where the desert got its palegray color
A huge lofty fluted column of green was a saguaro or giant cactus
Another oddshaped cactus resembling the legs of an inverted devilfish bore the name ocatillo
Each branch rose high and symmetrical furnished with sharp blades that seemed to be at once leaves and thorns
Yet another cactus interested Gale and it looked like a huge low barrel covered with greenribbed cloth and long thorns
This was the bisnaga or barrel cactus
According to Nell and Mercedes this plant was a happy exception to its desert neighbors for it secreted water which had many times saved the lives of men
Last of the cacti to attract Gale and the one to make him shiver was a low plant consisting of stem and many rounded protuberances of a frosty steely white and covered with long murderous spikes
From this plant the desert got its frosty glitter
It was as stiff as unyielding as steel and bore the name choya
Dicks enthusiasm was contagious and his earnest desire to learn was flattering to his teachers
When it came to assimilating Spanish however he did not appear to be so apt a pupil
He managed after many trials to acquire buenos dias and buenos tardes and senorita and gracias and a few other short terms
Dick was indeed eager to get a little smattering of Spanish and perhaps he was not really quite so stupid as he pretended to be
It was delightful to be taught by a beautiful Spaniard who was so gracious and intense and magnetic of personality and by a sweet American girl who moment by moment forgot her shyness
Gale wished to prolong the lessons
So that was the beginning of many afternoons in which he learned desert lore and Spanish verbs and something else that he dared not name
Nell Burton had never shown to Gale that daring side of her character which had been so suggestively defined in Beldings terse description and Ladds encomiums and in her own audacious speech and merry laugh and flashing eye of that nevertobeforgotten first meeting
She might have been an entirely different girl
But Gale remembered and when the ice had been somewhat broken between them he was always trying to surprise her into her real self
There were moments that fairly made him tingle with expectation
Yet he saw little more than a ghost of her vivacity and never a gleam of that individuality which Belding had called a devil
On the few occasions that Dick had been left alone with her in the patio Nell had grown suddenly unresponsive and restrained or she had left him on some transparent pretext
On the last occasion Mercedes returned to find Dick staring disconsolately at the rosebordered path where Nell had evidently vanished
The Spanish girl was wonderful in her divination
Senor Dick
she cried
Dick looked at her soberly nodded his head and then he laughed
Mercedes had seen through him in one swift glance
Her white hand touched his in wordless sympathy and thrilled him
This Spanish girl was all fire and passion and love
She understood him she was his friend she pledged him what he felt would be the most subtle and powerful influence
Little by little he learned details of Nells varied life
She had lived in many places
As a child she remembered moving from town to town of going to school among schoolmates whom she never had time to know
Lawrence Kansas where she studied for several years was the later exception to this changeful nature of her schooling
Then she moved to Stillwater Oklahoma from there to Austin Texas and on to Waco where her mother met and married Belding
They lived in New Mexico awhile in Tucson Arizona in Douglas and finally had come to lonely Forlorn River
Mother could never live in one place any length of time said Nell
And since weve been in the Southwest she has never ceased trying to find some trace of her father
He was last heard of in Nogales fourteen years ago
She thinks grandfather was lost in the Sonora DesertAnd every place we go is worse
Oh I love the desert
But Id like to go back to Lawrenceor to see Chicago or New Yorksome of the places Mr Gale speaks of
I remember the college at Lawrence though I was only twelve
I saw racesand once real football
Since then Ive read magazines and papers about big football games and I was always fascinated Mr Gale of course youve seen games
Yes a few replied Dick and he laughed a little
It was on his lips then to tell her about some of the famous games in which he had participated
But he refrained from exploiting himself
There was little however of the color and sound and cheer of the violent action and rush and battle incidental to a big college football game that he did not succeed in making Mercedes and Nell feel just as if they had been there
They hung breathless and wideeyed upon his words
Some one else was present at the latter part of Dicks narrative
The moment he became aware of Mrs Beldings presence he remembered fancying he had heard her call and now he was certain she had done so
Mercedes and Nell however had been and still were oblivious to everything except Dicks recital
He saw Mrs Belding cast a strange intent glance upon Nell then turn and go silently through the patio
Dick concluded his talk but the brilliant beginning was not sustained
Dick was haunted by the strange expression he had caught on Mrs Beldings face especially the look in her eyes
It had been one of repressed pain liberated in a flash of certainty
The mother had seen just as quickly as Mercedes how far he had gone on the road of love
Perhaps she had seen moreeven more than he dared hope
The incident roused Gale
He could not understand Mrs Belding nor why that look of hers that seeming baffled hopeless look of a woman who saw the inevitable forces of life and could not thwart them should cause him perplexity and distress
He wanted to go to her and tell her how he felt about Nell but fear of absolute destruction of his hopes held him back
He would wait
Nevertheless an instinct that was perhaps akin to selfpreservation prompted him to want to let Nell know the state of his mind
Words crowded his brain seeking utterance
Who and what he was how he loved her the work he expected to take up soon his longings hopes and plansthere was all this and more
But something checked him
And the repression made him so thoughtful and quiet even melancholy that he went outdoors to try to throw off the mood
The sun was yet high and a dazzling white light enveloped valleys and peaks
He felt that the wonderful sunshine was the dominant feature of that arid region
It was like white gold
It had burned its color in a face he knew
It was going to warm his blood and brown his skin
A hot languid breeze so dry that he felt his lips shrink with its contact came from the desert and it seemed to smell of wideopen untainted places where sand blew and strange pungent plants gave a bittersweet tang to the air
When he returned to the house some hours later his room had been put in order
In the middle of the white coverlet on his table lay a fresh red rose
Nell had dropped it there
Dick picked it up feeling a throb in his breast
It was a bud just beginning to open to show between its petals a darkred unfolding heart
How fragrant it was how exquisitely delicate how beautiful its inner hue of red deep and dark the crimson of life blood
Had Nell left it there by accident or by intent
Was it merely kindness or a girls subtlety
Was it a message couched elusively a symbol a hope in a halfblown desert rose
VI The Yaqui Toward evening of a lowering December day some fifty miles west of Forlorn River a horseman rode along an old dimly defined trail
From time to time he halted to study the lay of the land ahead
It was bare somber ridgy desert covered with duncolored greasewood and stunted prickly pear
Distant mountains hemmed in the valley raising black spurs above the round lomas and the squarewalled mesas
This lonely horseman bestrode a steed of magnificent build perfectly white except for a dark bar of color running down the noble head from ears to nose
Sweatcaked dust stained the long flanks
The horse had been running
His mane and tail were laced and knotted to keep their length out of reach of grasping cactus and brush
Clumsy homemade leather shields covered the front of his forelegs and ran up well to his wide breast
What otherwise would have been muscular symmetry of limb was marred by many a scar and many a lump
He was lean gaunt worn a huge machine of muscle and bone beautiful only in head and mane a weightcarrier a horse strong and fierce like the desert that had bred him
The rider fitted the horse as he fitted the saddle
He was a young man of exceedingly powerful physique wideshouldered longarmed biglegged
His lean face where it was not red blistered and peeling was the hue of bronze
He had a dark eye a falcon gaze roving and keen
His jaw was prominent and set mastifflike his lips were stern
It was youth with its softness not yet quite burned and hardened away that kept the whole cast of his face from being ruthless
This young man was Dick Gale but not the listless traveler nor the lounging wanderer who two months before had by chance dropped into Casita
Friendship chivalry lovethe deepseated unplumbed emotions that had been stirred into being with all their incalculable power for spiritual change had rendered different the meaning of life
In the moment almost of their realization the desert had claimed Gale and had drawn him into its crucible
The desert had multiplied weeks into years
Heat thirst hunger loneliness toil fear ferocity painhe knew them all
He had felt them allthe white sun with its glazed coalescing lurid fire the caked split lips and rasping drypuffed tongue the sickening ache in the pit of his stomach the insupportable silence the empty space the utter desolation the contempt of life the weary ride the long climb the plod in sand the search search search for water the sleepless night alone the watch and wait the dread of ambush the swift flight the fierce pursuit of men wild as Bedouins and as fleet the willingness to deal sudden death the pain of poison thorn the stinging tear of lead through flesh and that strange paradox of the burning desert the cold at night the piercing icy wind the dew that penetrated to the marrow the numbing desert cold of the dawn
Beyond any dream of adventure he had ever had beyond any wild story he had every read had been his experience with those hardriding rangers Ladd and Lash
Then he had traveled alone the hundred miles of desert between Forlorn River and the Sonoyta Oasis
Ladds prophecy of trouble on the border had been mild compared to what had become the actuality
With rebel occupancy of the garrison at Casita outlaws bandits raiders in rioting bands had spread westward
Like troops of Arabs magnificently mounted they were here there everywhere along the line and if murder and worse were confined to the Mexican side pillage and raiding were perpetrated across the border
Many a darkskinned raider bestrode one of Beldings fast horses and indeed all except his selected white thoroughbreds had been stolen
So the job of the rangers had become more than a patrolling of the boundary line to keep Japanese and Chinese from being smuggled into the United States
Belding kept close at home to protect his family and to hold his property
But the three rangers in fulfilling their duty had incurred risks on their own side of the line had been outraged robbed pursued and injured on the other
Some of the few waterholes that had to be reached lay far across the border in Mexican territory
Horses had to drink men had to drink and Ladd and Lash were not of the stripe that forsook a task because of danger
Slow to wrath at first as became men who had long lived peaceful lives they had at length revolted and desert vultures could have told a gruesome story
Made a comrade and ally of these bordermen Dick Gale had leaped at the desert action and strife with an intensity of heart and a rare physical ability which accounted for the remarkable fact that he had not yet fallen by the way
On this December afternoon the three rangers as often were separated
Lash was far to the westward of Sonoyta somewhere along Camino del Diablo that terrible Devils Road where many desert wayfarers had perished
Ladd had long been overdue in a prearranged meeting with Gale
The fact that Ladd had not shown up miles west of the Papago Well was significant
The sun had hidden behind clouds all the latter part of that day an unusual occurrence for that region even in winter
And now as the light waned suddenly telling of the hidden sunset a cold dry penetrating wind sprang up and blew in Gales face
Not at first but by imperceptible degrees it chilled him
He untied his coat from the back of the saddle and put it on
A few cold drops of rain touched his cheek
He halted upon the edge of a low escarpment
Below him the narrowing valley showed bare black ribs of rock long winding gray lines leading down to a central floor where mesquite and cactus dotted the barren landscape
Moving objects diminutive in size gray and white in color arrested Gales roving sight
They bobbed away for a while then stopped
They were antelope and they had seen his horse
When he rode on they started once more keeping to the lowest level
These wary animals were often desert watchdogs for the ranger they would betray the proximity of horse or man
With them trotting forward he made better time for some miles across the valley
When he lost them caution once more slowed his advance
The valley sloped up and narrowed to head into an arroyo where grass began to show gray between the clumps of mesquite
Shadows formed ahead in the hollows along the walls of the arroyo under the trees and they seemed to creep to rise to float into a veil cast by the background of bold mountains at last to claim the skyline
Night was not close at hand but it was there in the east lifting upward drooping downward encroaching upon the west
Gale dismounted to lead his horse to go forward more slowly
He had ridden sixty miles since morning and he was tired and a not entirely healed wound in his hip made one leg drag a little
A mile up the arroyo near its head lay the Papago Well
The need of water for his horse entailed a risk that otherwise he could have avoided
The well was on Mexican soil
Gale distinguished a faint light flickering through the thin sharp foliage
Campers were at the well and whoever they were no doubt they had prevented Ladd from meeting Gale
Ladd had gone back to the next waterhole or maybe he was hiding in an arroyo to the eastward awaiting developments
Gale turned his horse not without urge of iron arm and persuasive speech for the desert steed scented water and plodded back to the edge of the arroyo where in a secluded circle of mesquite he halted
The horse snorted his relief at the removal of the heavy burdened saddle and accoutrements and sagging bent his knees lowered himself with slow heave and plunged down to roll in the sand
Gale poured the contents of his larger canteen into his hat and held it to the horses nose
Drink Sol he said
It was but a drop for a thirsty horse
However Blanco Sol rubbed a west muzzle against Gales hand in appreciation
Gale loved the horse and was loved in return
They had saved each others lives and had spent long days and nights of desert solitude together
Sol had known other masters though none so kind as this new one but it was certain that Gale had never before known a horse
The spot of secluded ground was covered with bunches of galleta grass upon which Sol began to graze
Gale made a long halter of his lariat to keep the horse from wandering in search of water
Next Gale kicked off the cumbersome chapparejos with their flapping tripping folds of leather over his feet and drawing a long rifle from its leather sheath he slipped away into the shadows
The coyotes were howling not here and there but in concerted volume at the head of the arroyo
To Dick this was no more reassuring than had been the flickering light of the campfire
The wild desert dogs with their characteristic insolent curiosity were baying men round a campfire
Gale proceeded slowly halting every few steps careful not to brush against the stiff greasewood
In the soft sand his steps made no sound
The twinkling light vanished occasionally like a Jackolantern and when it did show it seemed still a long way off
Gale was not seeking trouble or inviting danger
Water was the thing that drove him
He must see who these campers were and then decide how to give Blanco Sol a drink
A rabbit rustled out of brush at Gales feet and thumped away over the sand
The wind pattered among dry broken stalks of dead ocatilla
Every little sound brought Gale to a listening pause
The gloom was thickening fast into darkness
It would be a night without starlight
He moved forward up the pale zigzag aisles between the mesquite
He lost the light for a while but the coyotes chorus told him he was approaching the campfire
Presently the light danced through the black branches and soon grew into a flame
Stooping low with bushy mesquites between him and the fire Gale advanced
The coyotes were in full cry
Gale heard the tramping stamping thumps of many hoofs
The sound worried him
Foot by foot he advanced and finally began to crawl
The wind favored his position so that neither coyotes nor horses could scent him
The nearer he approached the head of the arroyo where the well was located the thicker grew the desert vegetation
At length a dead palo verde with huge black clumps of its parasite mistletoe thick in the branches marked a distance from the well that Gale considered close enough
Noiselessly he crawled here and there until he secured a favorable position and then rose to peep from behind his covert
He saw a bright fire not a cookingfire for that would have been low and red but a crackling blaze of mesquite
Three men were in sight all close to the burning sticks
They were Mexicans and of the coarse type of raiders rebels bandits that Gale expected to see
One stood up his back to the fire another sat with shoulders enveloped in a blanket and the third lounged in the sand his feet almost in the blaze
They had cast off belts and weapons
A glint of steel caught Gales eye
Three short shiny carbines leaned against a rock
A little to the left within the circle of light stood a square house made of adobe bricks
Several untrimmed poles upheld a roof of brush which was partly fallen in
This house was a Papago Indian habitation and a month before had been occupied by a family that had been murdered or driven off by a roving band of outlaws
A rude corral showed dimly in the edge of firelight and from a black mass within came the snort and stamp and whinney of horses
Gale took in the scene in one quick glance then sank down at the foot of the mesquite
He had naturally expected to see more men
but the situation was by no means new
This was one or part of one of the raider bands harrying the border
They were stealing horses or driving a herd already stolen
These bands were more numerous than the waterholes of northern Sonora they never camped long at one place like Arabs they roamed over the desert all the way from Nogales to Casita
If Gale had gone peaceably up to this campfire there were a hundred chances that the raiders would kill and rob him to one chance that they might not
If they recognized him as a ranger comrade of Ladd and Lash if they got a glimpse of Blanco Sol then Gale would have no chance
These Mexicans had evidently been at the well some time
Their horses being in the corral meant that grazing had been done by day
Gale revolved questions in mind
Had this trio of outlaws run across Ladd
It was not likely for in that event they might not have been so comfortable and carefree in camp
Were they waiting for more members of their gang
That was very probable
With Gale however the most important consideration was how to get his horse to water
Sol must have a drink if it cost a fight
There was stern reason for Gale to hurry eastward along the trail
He thought it best to go back to where he had left his horse and not make any decisive move until daylight
With the same noiseless care he had exercised in the advance Gale retreated until it was safe for him to rise and walk on down the arroyo
He found Blanco Sol contentedly grazing
A heavy dew was falling and as the grass was abundant the horse did not show the usual restlessness and distress after a dry and exhausting day
Gale carried his saddle blankets and bags into the lee of a little greasewoodcovered mound from around which the wind had cut the soil and here in a wash he risked building a small fire
By this time the wind was piercingly cold
Gales hands were numb and he moved them to and fro in the little blaze
Then he made coffee in a cup cooked some slices of bacon on the end of a stick and took a couple of hard biscuits from a saddlebag
Of these his meal consisted
After that he removed the halter from Blanco Sol intending to leave him free to graze for a while
Then Gale returned to his little fire replenished it with short sticks of dead greasewood and mesquite and wrapping his blanket round his shoulders he sat down to warm himself and to wait till it was time to bring in the horse and tie him up
The fire was inadequate and Gale was cold and wet with dew
Hunger and thirst were with him
His bones ached and there was a dull deepseated pain throbbing in his unhealed wound
For days unshaven his beard seemed like a million pricking needles in his blistered skin
He was so tired that once having settled himself he did not move hand or foot
The night was dark dismal cloudy windy growing colder
A moan of wind in the mesquite was occasionally pierced by the highkeyed yelp of a coyote
There were lulls in which the silence seemed to be a thing of stifling
encroaching substancea thing that enveloped buried the desert
Judged by the great average of ideals and conventional standards of life Dick Gale was a starved lonely suffering miserable wretch
But in his case the judgment would have hit only externals would have missed the vital inner truth
For Gale was happy with a kind of strange wild glory in the privations the pains the perils and the silence and solitude to be endured on this desert land
In the past he had not been of any use to himself or others and he had never know what it meant to be hungry cold tired lonely
He had never worked for anything
The needs of the day had been provided and tomorrow and the future looked the same
Danger peril toilthese had been words read in books and papers
In the present he used his hands his senses and his wits
He had a duty to a man who relied on his services
He was a comrade a friend a valuable ally to riding fighting rangers
He had spend endless days weeks that seemed years alone with a horse trailing over climbing over hunting over a desert that was harsh and hostile by nature and perilous by the invasion of savage men
That horse had become human to Gale
And with him Gale had learned to know the simple needs of existence
Like dead scales the superficialities the falsities the habits that had once meant all of life dropped off useless things in this stern waste of rock and sand
Gales happiness as far as it concerned the toil and strife was perhaps a grim and stoical one
But love abided with him and it had engendered and fostered other undeveloped traitsromance and a feeling for beauty and a keen observation of nature
He felt pain but he was never miserable
He felt the solitude but he was never lonely
As he rode across the desert even though keen eyes searched for the moving black dots the rising puffs of white dust that were warnings he saw Nells face in every cloud
The cleancut mesas took on the shape of her straight profile with its strong chin and lips its fine nose and forehead
There was always a glint of gold or touch of red or graceful line or gleam of blue to remind him of her
Then at night her face shone warm and glowing flushing and paling in the campfire
Tonight as usual with a keen ear to the wind Gale listened as one on guard yet he watched the changing phantom of a sweet face in the embers and as he watched he thought
The desert developed and multiplied thought
A thousand sweet faces glowed in the pink and white ashes of his campfire the faces of other sweethearts or wives that had gleamed for other men
Gale was happy in his thought of Nell for Nell for something when he was alone this way in the wilderness told him she was near him she thought of him she loved him
But there were many men alone on that vast southwestern plateau and when they saw dream faces surely for some it was a fleeting flash a gleam soon gone like the hope and the name and the happiness that had been and was now no more
Often Gale thought of those hundreds of desert travelers prospectors wanderers who had ventured down the Camino del Diablo never to be heard of again
Belding had told him of that most terrible of all desert trailsa trail of shifting sands
Lash had traversed it and brought back stories of buried waterholes of bones bleaching white in the sun of gold mines as lost as were the prospectors who had sought them of the merciless Yaqui and his hatred for the Mexican
Gale thought of this trail and the men who had camped along it
For many there had been one night one campfire that had been the last
This idea seemed to creep in out of the darkness the loneliness the silence and to find a place in Gales mind so that it had strange fascination for him
He knew now as he had never dreamed before how men drifted into the desert leaving behind graves wrecked homes ruined lives lost wives and sweethearts
And for every wanderer every campfire had a phantom face
Gale measured the agony of these men at their last campfire by the joy and promise he traced in the ruddy heart of his own
By and by Gale remembered what he was waiting for and getting up he took the halter and went out to find Blanco Sol
It was pitchdark now and Gale could not see a rod ahead
He felt his way and presently as he rounded a mesquite he saw Sols white shape outlined against the blackness
The horse jumped and wheeled ready to run
It was doubtful if any one unknown to Sol could ever have caught him
Gales low call reassured him and he went on grazing
Gale haltered him in the likeliest patch of grass and returned to his camp
There he lifted his saddle into a protected spot under a low wall of the mound and laying one blanket on the sand he covered himself with the other and stretched himself for the night
Here he was out of reach of the wind but he heard its melancholy moan in the mesquite
There was no other sound
The coyotes had ceased their hungry cries
Gale dropped to sleep and slept soundly during the first half of the night and after that he seemed always to be partially awake aware of increasing cold and damp
The dark mantle turned gray and then daylight came quickly
The morning was clear and nipping cold
He threw off the wet blanket and got up cramped and half frozen
A little brisk action was all that was necessary to warm his blood and loosen his muscles and then he was fresh tingling eager
The sun rose in a golden blaze and the descending valley took on wondrous changing hues
Then he fetched up Blanco Sol saddled him and tied him to the thickest clump of mesquite
Sol well have a drink pretty soon he said patting the splendid neck
Gale meant it
He would not eat till he had watered his horse
Sol had gone nearly fortyeight hours without a sufficient drink and that was long enough even for a desertbred beast
No three raiders could keep Gale away from that well
Taking his rifle in hand he faced up the arroyo
Rabbits were frisking in the short willows and some were so tame he could have kicked them
Gale walked swiftly for a goodly part of the distance and then when he saw blue smoke curling up above the trees he proceeded slowly with alert eye and ear
From the lay of the land and position of trees seen by daylight he found an easier and safer course that the one he had taken in the dark
And by careful work he was enabled to get closer to the well and somewhat above it
The Mexicans were leisurely cooking their morning meal
They had two fires one for warmth the other to cook over
Gale had an idea these raiders were familiar to him
It seemed all these border hawks resembled one anotherbeing mostly small of build wiry angular swarthyfaced and blackhaired and they wore the oddly styled Mexican clothes and sombreros
A slow wrath stirred in Gale as he watched the trio
They showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp
One fellow evidently the leader packed a gun at his hip the only weapon in sight
Gale noted this with speculative eyes
The raiders had slept inside the little adobe house and had not yet brought out the carbines
Next Gale swept his gaze to the corral in which he saw more than a dozen horses some of them fine animals
They were stamping and whistling fighting one another and pawing the dirt
This was entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted to get at water and grass
But suddenly one of the blacks a big shaggy fellow shot up his ears and pointed his nose over the top of the fence
He whistled
Other horses looked in the same direction and their ears went up and they too whistled
Gale knew that other horses or men very likely both were approaching
But the Mexicans did not hear the alarm or show any interest if they did
These mescaldrinking raiders were not scouts
It was notorious how easily they could be surprised or ambushed
Mostly they were ignorant thickskulled peons
They were wonderful horsemen and could go long without food or water but they had not other accomplishments or attributes calculated to help them in desert warfare
They had poor sight poor hearing poor judgment and when excited they resembled crazed ants running wild
Gale saw two Indians on burros come riding up the other side of the knoll upon which the adobe house stood and apparently they were not aware of the presence of the Mexicans for they came on up the path
One Indian was a Papago
The other striking in appearance for other reasons than that he seemed to be about to fall from the burro Gale took to be a Yaqui
These travelers had absolutely nothing for an outfit except a blanket and a halfempty bag
They came over the knoll and down the path toward the well turned a corner of the house and completely surprised the raiders
Gale heard a short shrill cry strangely high and wild and this came from one of the Indians
It was answered by hoarse shouts
Then the leader of the trio the Mexican who packed a gun pulled it and fired pointblank
He missed onceand again
At the third shot the Papago shrieked and tumbled off his burro to fall in a heap
The other Indian swayed as if the taking away of the support lent by his comrade had brought collapse and with the fourth shot he too slipped to the ground
The reports had frightened the horses in the corral and the vicious black crowding the rickety bars broke them down
He came plunging out
Two of the Mexicans ran for him catching him by nose and mane and the third ran to block the gateway
Then with a splendid vaulting mount the Mexican with the gun leaped to the back of the horse
He yelled and waved his gun and urged the black forward
The manner of all three was savagely jocose
They were having sport
The two on the ground began to dance and jabber
The mounted leader shot again and then stuck like a leech upon the bare back of the rearing black
It was a vain show of horsemanship
Then this Mexican by some strange grip brought the horse down plunging almost upon the body of the Indian that had fallen last
Gale stood aghast with his rifle clutched tight
He could not divine the intention of the raider but suspected something brutal
The horse answered to that cruel guiding hand yet he swerved and bucked
He reared aloft pawing the air wildly snorting then he plunged down upon the prostrate Indian
Even in the act the intelligent animal tried to keep from striking the body with his hoofs
But that was not possible
A yell hideous in its passion signaled this feat of horsemanship
The Mexican made no move to trample the body of the Papago
He turned the black to ride again over the other Indian
That brought into Gales mind what he had heard of a Mexicans hate for a Yaqui
It recalled the barbarism of these savage peons and the war of extermination being waged upon the Yaquis
Suddenly Gale was horrified to see the Yaqui writhe and raise a feeble hand
The action brought renewed and more savage cries from the Mexicans
The horse snorted in terror
Gale could bear no more
He took a quick shot at the rider
He missed the moving figure but hit the horse
There was a bound a horrid scream a mighty plunge then the horse went down giving the Mexican a stunning fall
Both beast and man lay still
Gale rushed from his cover to intercept the other raiders before they could reach the house and their weapons
One fellow yelled and ran wildly in the opposite direction the other stood stricken in his tracks
Gale ran in close and picked up the gun that had dropped from the raider leaders hand
This fellow had begun to stir to come out of his stunned condition
Then the frightened horses burst the corral bars and in a thundering dustmantled stream fled up the arroyo
The fallen raider sat up mumbling to his saints in one breath cursing in his next
The other Mexican kept his stand intimidated by the threatening rifle
Go Greasers
Run
yelled Gale
Then he yelled it in Spanish
At the point of his rifle he drove the two raiders out of the camp
His next move was to run into the house and fetch out the carbines
With a heavy stone he dismantled each weapon
That done he set out on a run for his horse
He took the shortest cut down the arroyo with no concern as to whether or not he would encounter the raiders
Probably such a meeting would be all the worse for them and they knew it
Blanco Sol heard him coming and whistled a welcome and when Gale ran up the horse was snorting war
Mounting Gale rode rapidly back to the scene of the action and his first thought when he arrived at the well was to give Sol a drink and to fill his canteens
Then Gale led his horse up out of the waterhole and decided before remounting to have a look at the Indians
The Papago had been shot through the heart but the Yaqui was still alive
Moreover he was conscious and staring up at Gale with great strange somber eyes black as volcanic slag
Gringo goodno kill he said in husky whisper
His speech was not affirmative so much as questioning
Yaqui youre done for said Gale and his words were positive
He was simply speaking aloud his mind
Yaquino hurtmuch replied the Indian and then he spoke a strange wordrepeated it again and again
An instinct of Gales or perhaps some suggestion in the husky thick whisper or dark face told Gale to reach for his canteen
He lifted the Indian and gave him a drink and if ever in all his life he saw gratitude in human eyes he saw it then
Then he examined the injured Yaqui not forgetting for an instant to send wary fugitive glances on all sides
Gale was not surprised
The Indian had three woundsa bullet hole in his shoulder a crushed arm and a badly lacerated leg
What had been the matter with him before being set upon by the raider Gale could not be certain
The ranger thought rapidly
This Yaqui would live unless left there to die or be murdered by the Mexicans when they found courage to sneak back to the well
It never occurred to Gale to abandon the poor fellow
That was where his old training the higher order of human feeling made impossible the following of any elemental instinct of selfpreservation
All the same Gale knew he multiplied his perils a hundredfold by burdening himself with a crippled Indian
Swiftly he set to work and with rifle ever under his hand and shifting glance spared from his task he bound up the Yaquis wounds
At the same time he kept keen watch
The Indians burros and the horses of the raiders were all out of sight
Time was too valuable for Gale to use any in what might be a vain search
Therefore he lifted the Yaqui upon Sols broad shoulders and climbed into the saddle
At a word Sol dropped his head and started eastward up the trail walking swiftly without resentment for his double burden
Far ahead between two huge mesas where the trail mounted over a pass a long line of dust clouds marked the position of the horses that had escaped from the corral
Those that had been stolen would travel straight and true for home and perhaps would lead the others with them
The raiders were left on the desert without guns or mounts
Blanco Sol walked or jogtrotted six miles to the hour
At that gait fifty miles would not have wet or turned a hair of his dazzling white coat
Gale bearing in mind the everpresent possibility of encountering more raiders and of being pursued saved the strength of the horse
Once out of sight of Papago Well Gale dismounted and walked beside the horse steadying with one firm hand the helpless dangling Yaqui
The sun cleared the eastern ramparts and the coolness of morning fled as if before a magic foe
The whole desert changed
The grays wore bright the mesquites glistened the cactus took the silver hue of frost and the rocks gleamed gold and red
Then as the heat increased a wind rushed up out of the valley behind Gale and the hotter the sun blazed down the swifter rushed the wind
The wonderful transparent haze of distance lost its bluish hue for one with tinge of yellow
Flying sand made the peaks dimly outlined
Gale kept pace with his horse
He bore the twinge of pain that darted through his injured hip at every stride
His eye roved over the wide smoky prospect seeking the landmarks he knew
When the wild and bold spurs of No Name Mountains loomed through a rent in flying clouds of sand he felt nearer home
Another hour brought him abreast of a dark straight shaft rising clear from a beetling escarpment
This was a monument marking the international boundary line
When he had passed it he had his own country under foot
In the heat of midday he halted in the shade of a rock and lifting the Yak down gave him a drink
Then after a long sweeping survey of the surrounding desert he removed Solds saddle and let him roll and took for himself a welcome rest and a bite to eat
The Yak was tenacious of life
He was still holding his own
For the first time Gale really looked at the Indian to study him
He had a large head nobly cast and a face that resembled a shrunken mask
It seemed chiseled in the darkred volcanic lava of his Sooner wilderness
The Indians eyes were always black and mystic but this Yaks encompassed all the tragic desolation of the desert
They were fixed on Gale moved only when he moved
The Indian was short and broad and his body showed unusual muscular development although he seemed greatly emaciated from starvation or illness
Gale resumed his homeward journey
When he got through the pass he faced a great depression as rough as if millions of gigantic spikes had been driven by the hammer of Thorn into a seamed and cracked floor
This was Altar Valley
It was a chaos of arrays canyons rocks and ridges all mantled with cactus and at its eastern end it claimed the dry bed of Forlorn River and water when there was any
With a wounded helpless man across the saddle this stretch of thorny and contorted desert was practically impassable
Yet Gale headed into it unflinchingly
He would carry the Yaqui as far as possible or until death made the burden no longer a duty
Blanco Sol plodded on over the dragging sand up and down the steep loose banks of washes out on the rocks and through the rows of whitetoothed choyas
The sun sloped westward bending fiercer heat in vengeful parting reluctance
The wind slackened
The dust settled
And the bold forbidding front of No Name Mountains changed to red and gold
Gale held grimly by the side of the tireless implacable horse holding the Yaqui on the saddle taking the brunt of the merciless thorns
In the end it became heartrending toil
His heavy chaps dragged him down but he dared not go on without them for thick and stiff as they were the terrible steelbayoneted spikes of the choyas pierced through to sting his legs
To the last mile Gale held to Blanco Sols gait and kept everwatchful gaze ahead on the trail
Then with the low flat houses of Forlorn River shining red in the sunset Gale flagged and rapidly weakened
The Yaqui slipped out of the saddle and dropped limp in the sand
Gale could not mount his horse
He clutched Sols long tail and twisted his hand in it and staggered on
Blanco Sol whistled a piercing blast
He scented cool water and sweet alfalfa hay
Twinkling lights ahead meant rest
The melancholy desert twilight rapidly succeeded the sunset
It accentuated the forlorn loneliness of the gray winding river of sand and its grayer shores
Night shadows trooped down from the black and looming mountains
VII White Horses A crippled Yaqui
Why the hell did you saddle yourself with him
roared Belding as he laid Gale upon the bed
Belding had grown hard these late violent weeks
Because I chose whispered Gale in reply
Go after himhe dropped in the trailacross the rivernear the first big saguaro
Belding began to swear as he fumbled with matches and the lamp but as the light flared up he stopped short in the middle of a word
You said you werent hurt
he demanded in sharp anxiety as he bent over Gale
Im onlyall inWill you goor send some onefor the Yaqui
Sure Dick sure Belding replied in softer tones
Then he stalked out his heels rang on the flagstones he opened a door and called Mothergirls heres Dick back
Hes done upNow no no hes not hurt or in bad shape
You womenDo what you can to make him comfortable
Ive got a little job on hand
There were quick replies that Gales dulling ears did not distinguish
Then it seemed Mrs Belding was beside his bed her presence so cool and soothing and helpful and Mercedes and Nell wideeyed and whitefaced were fluttering around him
He drank thirstily but refused food
He wanted rest
And with their faces drifting away in a kind of haze with the feeling of gentle hands about him he lost consciousness
He slept twenty hours
then he arose thirsty hungry lame overworn and presently went in search of Belding and the business of the day
Your Yaqui was near dead but guess well pull him through said Belding
Dick the other day that Indian came here by rail and foot and Lord only knows how else all the way from New Orleans
He spoke English better than most Indians and I know a little Yaqui
I got some of his story and guessed the rest
The Mexican government is trying to root out the Yaquis
A year ago his tribe was taken in chains to a Mexican port on the Gulf
The fathers mothers children were separated and put in ships bound for Yucatan
There they were made slaves on the great henequen plantations
They were driven beaten starved
Each slave had for a days rations a hunk of sour dough no more
Yucatan is low marshy damp hot
The Yaquis were bred on the high dry Sonoran plateau where the air is like a knife
They dropped dead in the henequen fields and their places were taken by more
You see the Mexicans wont kill outright in their war of extermination of the Yaquis
They get use out of them
Its a horrible thingWell this Yaqui you brought in escaped from his captors got aboard ship and eventually reached New Orleans
Somehow he traveled way out here
I gave him a bag of food and he went off with a Papago Indian
He was a sick man then
And he must have fallen foul of some Greasers
Gale told of his experience at Papago Well
That raider who tried to grind the Yaqui under a horses hoofshe was a hyena
concluded Gale shuddering
Ive seen some blood spilled and some hard sights but that inhuman devil took my nerve
Why as I told you Belding I missed a shot at himnot twenty paces
Dick in cases like that the sooner you clean up the bunch the better said Belding grimly
As for hard sightswait till youve seen a Yaqui do up a Mexican
Bar none that is the limit
Its blood lust a racial hate deep as life and terrible
The Spaniards crushed the Aztecs four or five hundred years ago
That hate has had time to grow as deep as a cactus root
The Yaquis are mountain Aztecs
Personally I think they are noble and intelligent and if let alone would be peaceable and industrious
I like the few Ive known
But they are a doomed race
Have you any idea what ailed this Yaqui before the raider got in his work
No I havent
I noticed the Indian seemed in bad shape but I couldnt tell what was the matter with him
Well my idea is another personal one
Maybe its off color
I think that Yaqui was or is for that matter dying of a broken heart
All he wanted was to get back to his mountains and die
There are no Yaquis left in that part of Sonora he was bound for
He had a strange look in his eyes said Gale thoughtfully
Yes I noticed that
But all Yaquis have a wild look
Dick if Im not mistaken this fellow was a chief
It was a waste of strength a needless risk for you to save him pack him back here
but damn the whole Greaser outfit generally Im glad you did
Gale remembered then to speak of his concern for Ladd
Laddy didnt go out to meet you replied Belding
I knew you were due in any day and as theres been trouble between here and Casita I sent him that way
Since youve been out our friend Carter lost a bunch of horses and a few steers
Did you get a good look at the horses those raiders had at Papago Well
Dick had learned since he had become a ranger to see everything with keen sure photographic eye and being put to the test so often required of him he described the horses as a darkcolored drove mostly bays and blacks with one spotted sorrel
Some of Carterssure as youre born
exclaimed Belding
His bunch has been split up divided among several bands of raiders
He has a grass ranch up here in Three Mile Arroyo
Its a good long ride in U S territory from the border
Those horses I saw will go home dont you think
asked Dick
Sure
They cant be caught or stopped
Well what shall I do now
Stay here and rest bluntly replied Belding
You need it
Let the women fuss over youdoctor you a little
When Jim gets back from Sonoyta Ill know more about what we ought to do
By Lord
it seems our job now isnt keeping Japs and Chinks out of the U S Its keeping our property from going into Mexico
Are there any letters for me
asked Gale
Letters
Say my boy itd take something pretty important to get me or any man here back Casita way
If the town is safe these days the road isnt
Its a month now since any one went to Casita
Gale had received several letters from his sister Elsie the last of which he had not answered
There had not been much opportunity for writing on his infrequent returns to Forlorn River and besides Elsie had written that her father had stormed over what he considered Dicks falling into wild and evil ways
Time flies said Dick
George Thorne will be free before long and hell be coming out
I wonder if hell stay here or try to take Mercedes away
Well hell stay right here in Forlorn River if I have any say replied Belding
Id like to know how hed ever get that Spanish girl out of the country now with all the trails overrun by rebels and raiders
Itd be hard to disguise her
Say Dick maybe we can get Thorne to stay here
You know since youve discovered the possibility of a big water supply Ive had dreams of a future for Forlorn RiverIf only this war was over
Dick thats what it iswarscattered war along the northern border of Mexico from gulf to gulf
What if it isnt our war
Were on the fringe
No we cant develop Forlorn River until theres peace
The discovery that Belding alluded to was one that might very well lead to the making of a wonderful and agricultural district of Altar Valley
While in college Dick Gale had studied engineering but he had not set the scientific world afire with his brilliance
Nor after leaving college had he been able to satisfy his father that he could hold a job
Nevertheless his smattering of engineering skill bore fruit in the last place on earth where anything might have been expected of itin the desert
Gale had always wondered about the source of Forlorn River
No white man or Mexican or so far as known no Indian had climbed those mighty broken steps of rock called No Name Mountains from which Forlorn River was supposed to come
Gale had discovered a long narrow rockbottomed and rockwalled gulch that could be dammed at the lower end by the dynamiting of leaning cliffs above
An inexhaustible supply of water could be stored there
Furthermore he had worked out an irrigation plan to bring the water down for mining uses and to make a paradise out of that part of Altar Valley which lay in the United States
Belding claimed there was gold in the arroyos gold in the gulches not in quantities to make a prospector rejoice but enough to work for
And the soil on the higher levels of Altar Valley needed only water to make it grow anything the year round
Gale too had come to have dreams of a future for Forlorn River
On the afternoon of the following day Ladd unexpectedly appeared leading a lame and lathered horse into the yard
Belding and Gale who were at work at the forge looked up and were surprised out of speech
The legs of the horse were raw and red and he seemed about to drop
Ladds sombrero was missing he wore a bloody scarf round his head sweat and blood and dust had formed a crust on his face little streams of powdery dust slid from him and the lower half of his scarred chaps were full of broken white thorns
Howdy boys he drawled
I shore am glad to see you all
Wheren hells your hat
demanded Belding furiously
It was a ridiculous greeting
But Beldings words signified little
The dark shade of worry and solicitude crossing his face told more than his black amaze
The ranger stopped unbuckling the saddle girths and looking at Belding broke into his slow cool laugh
Tom you recollect that whopper of a saguaro up here where Carters trail branches off the main trail to Casita
Well I climbed it an left my hat on top for a woodpeckers nest
Youve been runningfighting
queried Belding as if Ladd had not spoken at all
I reckon itll dawn on you after a while replied Ladd slipping the saddle
Laddy go in the house to the women said Belding
Ill tend to your horse
Shore Tom in a minute
Ive been down the road
An I found hoss tracks an steer tracks goin across the line
But I seen no sign of raiders till this mornin
Slept at Carters last night
That raid the other day cleaned him out
Hes shootin mad
Well this mornin I rode plumb into a bunch of Carters hosses runnin wild for home
Some Greasers were tryin to head them round an chase them back across the line
I rode in between an made matters embarrassin
Carters hosses got away
Then me an the Greasers had a little game of hide an seek in the cactus
I was on the wrong side an had to break through their line to head toward home
We run some
But I had a closer call than Im stuck on havin
Laddy you wouldnt have any such close calls if youd ride one of my horses expostulated Belding
This broncho of yours can run and Lord knows hes game
But you want a big strong horse Mexican bred with cactus in his blood
Take one of the bunchBull White Woman Blanco Jose
I had a big fast horse a while back but I lost him said Ladd
This bronch aint so bad
Shore Bull an that white devil with his Greaser namethey could run down my bronch kill him in a mile of cactus
But somehow Tom I cant make up my mind to take one of them grand white hosses
Shore I reckon Im kinda soft
An mebbe Id better take one before the raiders clean up Forlorn River
Belding cursed low and deep in his throat and the sound resembled muttering thunder
The shade of anxiety on his face changed to one of dark gloom and passion
Next to his wife and daughter there was nothing so dear to him as those white horses
His father and grandfatherall his progenitors of whom he had tracehad been lovers of horses
It was in Beldings blood
Laddy before its too late cant I get the whites away from the border
Mebbe it aint too late but where can we take them
To San Felipe
No
Weve more chance to hold them here
To Casita and the railroad
Afraid to risk gettin there
An the towns full of rebels who need hosses
Then straight north
Shore man youre crazy
Thers no water no grass for a hundred miles
Ill tell you Tom the safest plan would be to take the white bunch south into Sonora into some wild mountain valley
Keep them there till the raiders have traveled on back east
Pretty soon there wont be any rich pickin left for these Greasers
An then theyll ride on to new ranges
Laddy I dont know the trails into Sonora
An I cant trust a Mexican or a Papago
Between you and me Im afraid of this Indian who herds for me
I reckon wed better stick here TomDick its some good to see you again
But you seem kinda quiet
Shore you get quieter all the time
Did you see any sign of Jim out Sonoyta way
Then Belding led the lame horse toward the wateringtrough while the two rangers went toward the house Dick was telling Ladd about the affair at Papago Well when they turned the corner under the porch
Nell was sitting in the door
She rose with a little scream and came flying toward them
Now Ill get it whispered Ladd
The womenll make a baby of me
An shore I cant help myself
Oh Laddy youve been hurt
cried Nell as with white cheeks and dilating eyes she ran to him and caught his arm
Nell I only run a thorn in my ear
Oh Laddy dont lie
Youve lied before
I know youre hurt
Come in to mother
Shore Nell its only a scratch
My bronch throwed me
Laddy no horse every threw you
The girls words and accusing eyes only hurried the ranger on to further duplicity
Mebbe I got it when I was ridin hard under a mesquite an a sharp snag Youve been shotMama heres Laddy and hes been shotOh these dreadful days were having
I cant bear them
Forlorn River used to be so safe and quiet
Nothing happened
But now
Jim comes home with a bloody hole in himthen Dickthen LaddyOh Im afraid some day theyll never come home
The morning was bright still and clear as crystal
The heat waves had not yet begun to rise from the desert
A soft gray white and green tint perfectly blended lay like a mantle over mesquite and sand and cactus
The canyons of distant mountain showed deep and full of lilac haze
Nell sat perched high upon the topmost bar of the corral gate
Dick leaned beside her now with his eyes on her face now gazing out into the alfalfa field where Beldings thoroughbreds grazed and pranced and romped and whistled
Nell watched the horses
She loved them never tired of watching them
But her gaze was too consciously averted from the yearning eyes that tried to meet hers to be altogether natural
A great fenced field of dark velvety green alfalfa furnished a rich background for the drove of about twenty white horses
Even without the horses the field would have presented a striking contrast to the surrounding hot glaring blaze of rock and sand
Belding had bred a hundred or more horses from the original stock he had brought up from Durango
His particular interest was in the almost unblemished whites and these he had given especial care
He made a good deal of money selling this strain to friends among the ranchers back in Texas
No mercenary consideration however could have made him part with the great rangy white horses he had gotten from the Durango breeder
He called them Blanco Diablo White Devil Blanco Sol White Sun Blanca Reina White Queen Blanca Mujer White Woman and El Gran Toro Blanco The Big White Bull
Belding had been laughed at by ranchers for preserving the sentimental Durango names and he had been unmercifully ridiculed by cowboys
The the names had never been changed
Blanco Diablo was the only horse in the field that was not free to roam and graze where he listed
A stake and a halter held him to one corner where he was severely let alone by the other horses
He did not like this isolation
Blanco Diablo was not happy unless he was running or fighting a rival
Of the two he would rather fight
If anything white could resemble a devil this horse surely did
He had nothing beautiful about him yet he drew the gaze and held it
The look of him suggested discontent anger revolt viciousness
When he was not grazing or prancing he held his long lean head level pointing his nose and showing his teeth
Beldings favorite was almost all the world to him and he swore Diablo could stand more heat and thirst and cactus than any other horse he owned and could run down and kill any horse in the Southwest
The fact that Ladd did not agree with Belding on these salient points was a great disappointment and also a perpetual source for argument
Ladd and Lash both hated Diablo and Dick Gale after one or two narrow escapes from being brained had inclined to the cowboys side of the question
El Gran Toro Blanco upheld his name
He was a huge massive thickflanked stallion a kingly mate for his fullbodied glossy consort Blanca Reina
The other mare Blanca Mujer was dazzling white without a spot perfectly pointed racy graceful elegant yet carrying weight and brawn and range that suggested her relation to her forebears
The cowboys admitted some of Beldings claims for Diablo but they gave loyal and unshakable allegiance to Blanco Sol
As for Dick he had to fight himself to keep out of arguments for he sometimes imagined he was unreasonable about the horse
Though he could not understand himself he knew he loved Sol as a man loved a friend a brother
Free of heavy saddle and the clumsy leg shields Blanco Sol was somehow allsatisfying to the eyes of the rangers
As long and big as Diablo was Sol was longer and bigger
Also he was higher more powerful
He looked more a thing for actionspeedier
At a distance the honorable scars and lumps that marred his muscular legs were not visible
He grazed aloof from the others and did not cavort nor prance but when he lifted his head to whistle how wild he appeared and proud and splendid
The dazzling whiteness of the desert sun shone from his coat he had the fire and spirit of the desert in his noble head its strength and power in his gigantic frame
Belding swears Sol never beat Diablo Dick was saying
He believes it replied Nell
Dad is queer about that horse
But Laddy rode Sol oncemade him beat Diablo
Jim saw the race
Nell laughed
I saw it too
For that matter even I have made Sol put his nose before Dads favorite
Id like to have seen that
Nell arent you ever going to ride with me
Some daywhen its safe
Safe
II mean when the raiders have left the border
Oh Im glad you mean that said Dick laughing
Well Ive often wondered how Belding ever came to give Blanco Sol to me
He was jealous
I think he wanted to get rid of Sol
No
Why Nell hed give Laddy or Jim one of the whites any day
Would he
Not Devil or Queen or White Woman
Never in this world
But Dad has lots of fast horses the boys could pick from
Dick I tell you Dad wants Blanco Sol to run himself outlose his speed on the desert
Dad is just jealous for Diablo
Maybe
He surely has strange passion for horses
I think I understand better than I used to
I owned a couple of racers once
They were just animals to me I guess
But Blanco Sol
Do you love him
asked Nell and now a warm blue flash of eyes swept his face
Do I
Well rather
Im glad
Sol has been finer a better horse since you owned him
He loves you Dick
Hes always watching for you
See him raise his head
Thats for you
I know as much about horses as Dad or Laddy any day
Sol always hated Diablo and he never had much use for Dad
Dick looked up at her
Itll bebe pretty hard to leave Solwhen I go away
Nell sat perfectly still
Go away
she asked presently with just the faintest tremor in her voice
Yes
Sometimes when I get blueas I am todayI think Ill go
But in sober truth Nell its not likely that Ill spend all my life here
There was no answer to this
Dick put his hand softly over hers and despite her halfhearted struggle to free it he held on
Nell
Her color fled
He saw her lips part
Then a heavy step on the gravel a cheerful complaining voice interrupted him and made him release Nell and draw back
Belding strode into view round the adobe shed
Hey Dick that darned Yaqui Indian cant be driven or hired or coaxed to leave Forlorn River
Hes well enough to travel
I offered him horse gun blanket grub
But no go
Thats funny replied Gale with a smile
Let him stayput him to work It doesnt strike me funny
But Ill tell you what I think
That poor homeles heartbroken Indian has taken a liking to you Dick
These desert Yaquis are strange folk
Ive heard strange stories about them
Id believe most anything
And thats how I figure his case
You saved his life
That sort of thing counts big with any Indian even with an Apache
With a Yaqui maybe its of deep significance
Ive heard a Yaqui say that with his tribe no debt to friend or foe ever went unpaid
Perhaps thats what ails this fellow
Dick dont laugh said Nell
Ive noticed the Yaqui
Its pathetic the way his great gloomy eyes follow you
Youve made a friend continued Belding
A Yaqui could be a real friend on this desert
If he gets his strength back hell be of service to you dont mistake me
Hes welcome here
But youre responsible for him and youll have trouble keeping him from massacring all the Greasers in Forlorn River
The probability of a visit from the raiders and a dash bolder than usual on the outskirts of a ranch led Belding to build a new corral
It was not sightly to the eye but it was high and exceedingly strong
The gate was a massive affair swinging on huge hinges and fastening with heavy chains and padlocks
On the outside it had been completely covered with barb wire which would make it a troublesome thing to work on in the dark
At night Belding locked his white horses in this corral
The Papago hersman slept in the adobe shed adjoining
Belding did not imagine that any wooden fence however substantially built could keep determined raiders from breaking it down
They would have to take time however and make considerable noise and Belding relied on these facts
Belding did not believe a band of night raiders would hold out against a hot rifle fire
So he began to make up some of the sleep he had lost
It was noteworthy however that Ladd did not share Beldings sanguine hopes
Jim Lash rode in reporting that all was well out along the line toward the Sonoyta Oasis
Days passed and Belding kept his rangers home
Nothing was heard of raiders at hand
Many of the newcomers both American and Mexican who came with wagons and pack trains from Casita stated that property and life were cheap back in that rebelinfested town
One January morning Dick Gale was awakened by a shrill menacing cry
He leaped up bewildered and frightened
He heard Beldings booming voice answering shouts and rapid steps on flagstones
But these had not awakened him
Heavy breaths almost sobs seemed at his very door
In the cold and gray dawn Dick saw something white
Gun in hand he bounded across the room
Just ouside his door stood Blanco Sol
It was not unusual for Sol to come poking his head in at Dicks door during daylight
But now in the early dawn when he had been locked in the corral it meant raidersno less
Dick called softly to the snorting horse and hurriedly getting into clothes and boots he went out with a gun in each hand
Sol was quivering in every muscle
Like a dog he followed Dick around the house
Hearing shouts in the direction of the corrals Gale bent swift steps that way
He caught up with Jim Lash who was also leading a white horse
Hello Jim
Guess its all over but the fireworks said Dick
I caint say just what has come off replied Lash
Ive got the Bull
Found him runnin in the yard
They reached the corral to find Belding shaking roaring like a madman
The gate was open the corral was empty
Ladd stooped over the ground evidently trying to find tracks
I reckon we might jest as well cool off an wait for daylight suggested Jim
Shore
Theyve flown the coop you can gamble on that
Tom wheres the Papago
said Ladd
Hes gone Laddygone
Doublecrossed us eh
I see heres a crowbar lyin by the gatepost
That Indian fetched it from the forge
It was used to pry out the bolts an steeples
Tom I reckon there wasnt much time lost forcin that gate
Belding in shirt sleeves and barefooted roared with rage
He said he had heard the horses running as he leaped out of bed
What woke you
asked Laddy
Sol
He came whistling for Dick
Didnt you hear him before I called you
Hear him
He came thunderin right under my window
I jumped up in bed an when he let out that blast Jim lit square in the middle of the floor an I was scared stiff
Dick seein it was your room he blew into what did you think
I couldnt think
Im shaking yet Laddy
Boys Ill bet Sol spilled a few raiders if any got hands on him said Jim
Now lets sit down an wait for daylight
Its my idea well find some of the hosses runnin loose
Tom you go an get some clothes on
Its freezin cold
An dont forget to tell the women folks were all right
Daylight made clear some details of the raid
The cowboys found tracks of eight raiders coming up from the river bed where their horses had been left
Evidently the Papago had been false to his trust
He few personal belongings were gone
Lash was correct in his idea of finding more horses loose in the fields
The men soon rounded up eleven of the whites all more or less frightened and among the number were Queen and Blanca Mujer
The raiders had been unable to handle more than one horse for each man
It was bitter irony of fate that Belding should lose his favorite the one horse more dear to him than all the others
Somewhere out on the trail a raider was fighting the ironjawed savage Blanco Diablo
I reckon were some lucky observed Jim Lash
Lucky aint enough word replied Ladd
You see it was this way
Some of the raiders piled over the fence while the others worked on the gate
Mebbe the Papago went inside to pick out the best hosses
But it didnt work except with Diablo an how they ever got him I dont know
Id have gambled itd take all of eight men to steal him
But Greasers have got us skinned on handlin hosses
Belding was unconsolable
He cursed and railed and finally declared he was going to trail the raiders
Tom you just aint agoin to do nothin of the kind said Ladd coolly
Belding groaned and bowed his head
Laddy youre right he replied presently
Ive got to stand it
I cant leave the women and my property
But its sure tough
Im sore way down deep and nothin but blood would ever satisfy me
Leave that to me an Jim said Ladd
What do you mean to do
demanded Belding starting up
Shore I dont know yetGive me a light for my pipe
An Dick go fetch out your Yaqui
VIII The Running of Blanco Sol The Yaquis strange dark glance roved over the corral the swinging gate with its broken fastenings the tracks in the road and then rested upon Belding
Malo he said and his Spanish was clear
Shore Yaqui about eight bad men an a traitor Indian said Ladd
I think he means my herder added Belding
If he does that settles any doubt it might be decent to haveYaquimalo PapagoSi
The Yaqui spread wide his hands
Then he bent over the tracks in the road
They led everywhither but gradually he worked out of the thick net to take the trail that the cowboys had followed down to the river
Belding and the rangers kept close at his heels
Occasionally Dick lent a helping hand to the still feeble Indian
He found a trampled spot where the raiders had left their horses
From this point a deeply defined narrow trail led across the dry river bed
Belding asked the Yaqui where the raiders would head for in the Sonora Desert
For answer the Indian followed the trail across the streem of sand through willows and mesquite up to the level of rock and cactus
At this point he halted
A sandfilled almost obliterated trail led off to the left and evidently went round to the east of No Name Mountains
To the right stretched the road toward Papago Well and the Sonoyta Oasis
The trail of the raiders took a southeasterly course over untrodden desert
The Yaqui spoke in his own tongue then in Spanish
Think he means slow march said Belding
Laddy from the looks of that trail the Greasers are having trouble with the horses
Tom shore a boy could see that replied Laddy Ask Yaqui to tell us where the raiders are headin an if theres water
It was wonderful to see the Yaqui point
His dark hand stretched he sighted over his stretched finger at a low white escarpment in the distance
Then with a stick he traced a line in the sand and then at the end of that another line at right angles
He made crosses and marks and holes and as he drew the rude map he talked in Yaqui in Spanish with a word here and there in English
Belding translated as best he could
The raiders were heading southeast toward the railroad that ran from Nogales down into Sonora
It was four days travel bad trail good sure waterhole one day out then water not sure for two days
Raiders traveling slow bothered by too many horses not looking for pursuit were never pursued could be headed and ambushed that night at the first waterhole a natural trap in a valley
The men returned to the ranch
The rangers ate and drank while making hurried preparations for travel
Blanco Sol and the cowboys horses were fed watered and saddled
Ladd again refused to ride one of Beldings whites
He was quick and cold
Get me a longrange rifle an lots of shells
Rustle now he said
Laddy you dont want to be weighted down
protested Belding
Shore I want a gun thatll outshoot the dinky little carbines an muskets used by the rebels
Trot one out an be quick
Ive got a 405 a longbarreled heavy rifle thatll shoot a mile
I use it for mountain sheep
But Laddy itll break that bronchs back
His back wont break so easyDick take plenty of shells for your Remington
An dont forget your field glass
In less than an hour after the time of the raid the three rangers heavily armed and superbly mounted on fresh horses rode out on the trail
As Gale turned to look back from the far bank of Forlorn River he saw Nell waving a white scarf
He stood high in his stirrups and waved his sombrero
Then the mesquites hid the girls slight figure and Gale wheeled grimfaced to follow the rangers
They rode in single file with Ladd in the lead
He did not keep to the trail of the raiders all the time
He made short cuts
The raiders were traveling leisurely and they evinced a liking for the most level and least cactuscovered stretches of ground
But the cowboy took a beeline course for the white escarpment pointed out by the Yaqui and nothing save deep washes and impassable patches of cactus or rocks made him swerve from it
He kept the broncho at a steady walk over the rougher places and at a swinging Indian canter over the hard and level ground
The sun grew hot and the wind began to blow
Dust clouds rolled along the blue horizon
Whirling columns of sand like water spouts at sea circled up out of white arid basins and swept away and spread aloft before the wind
The escarpment began to rise to change color to show breaks upon it rocky face
Whenever the rangers rode out on the brow of a knoll or ridge or an eminence before starting to descend Ladd required of Gale a long careful sweeping survey of the desert ahead through the field glass
There were streams of white dust to be seen streaks of yellow dust trailing low clouds of sand over the glistening dunes but no steadily rising uniformly shaped puffs that would tell a tale of moving horses on the desert
At noon the rangers got out of the thick cactus
Moreover the gravelbottomed washes the low weathering rotting ledges of yellow rock gave place to hard sandy rolls and bare clay knolls
The desert resembled a rounded hummocky sea of color
All light shades of blue and pink and yellow and mauve were there dominated by the glaring white sun
Mirages glistened wavered faded in the shimmering waves of heat
Dust as fine as power whiffed up from under the tireless hoofs
The rangers rode on and the escarpment began to loom
The desert floor inclined perceptibly upward
When Gale got an unobstructed view of the slope of the escarpment he located the raiders and horses
In another hours travel the rangers could see with naked eyes a long faint moving streak of black and white dots
Theyre headin for that yellow pass said Ladd pointing to a break in the eastern end of the escarpment
When they get out of sight well rustle
Im thinkin that waterhole the Yaqui spoke of lays in the pass
The rangers traveled swiftly over the remaining miles of level desert leading to the ascent of the escarpment
When they achieved the gateway of the pass the sun was low in the west
Dwarfed mesquite and greasewood appeared among the rocks
Ladd gave the word to tie up horses and go forward on foot
The narrow neck of the pass opened and descended into a valley half a mile wide perhaps twice that in length
It had apparently unscalable slopes of weathered rock leading up to beetling walls
With floor bare and hard and white except for a patch of green mesquite near the far end it was a lurid and desolate spot the barren bottom of a desert bowl
Keep down boys said Ladd
Theres the waterhole an hosses have sharp eyes
Shore the Yaqui figgered this place
I never seen its like for a trap
Both white and black horses showed against the green and a thin curling column of blue smoke rose lazily from amid the mesquites
I reckon wed better wait till dark or mebbe daylight said Jim Lash
Let me figger some
Dick what do you make of the outlet to this hole
Looks rough to me
With his glass Gale studied the narrow construction of walls and roughened rising floor
Laddy its harder to get out at that end than here he replied
Shore thats hard enough
Let me have a lookWell boys it dont take no figgerin for this job
Jim Ill want you at the other end blockin the pass when were ready to start
Whenll that be
inquired Jim
Soon as its light enough in the mornin
That Greaser outfit will hang till tomorrow
Theres no sure water ahead for two days you remember
I reckon I can slip through to the other end after dark said Lash thoughtfully
It might get me in bad to go round
The rangers stole back from the vantage point and returned to their horses which they untied and left farther round among broken sections of cliff
For the horses it was a dry hungry camp but the rangers built a fire and had their short though strengthening meal
The location was high and through a break in the jumble of rocks the great colored void of desert could be seen rolling away endlessly to the west
The sun set and after it had gone down the golden tips of mountains dulled their lower shadows creeping upward
Jim Lash rolled in his saddle blanket his feet near the fire and went to sleep
Ladd told Gale to do likewise while he kept the fire up and waited until it was late enough for Jim to undertake circling round the raiders
When Gale awakened the night was dark cold windy
The stars shone with white brilliance
Jim was up saddling his horse and Ladd was talking low
When Gale rose to accompany them both rangers said he need not go
But Gale wanted to go because that was the thing Ladd or Jim would have done
With Ladd leading they moved away into the gloom
Advance was exceedingly slow careful silent
Under the walls the blackness seemed impenetrable
The horse was as cautious as his master
Ladd did not lose his way nevertheless he wound between blocks of stone and clumps of mesquite and often tried a passage to abandon it
Finally the trail showed pale in the gloom and eastern stars twinkled between the lofty ramparts of the pass
The advance here was still as stealthily made as before but not so difficult or slow
When the dense gloom of the pass lightened and there was a wide space of sky and stars overhead Ladd halted and stood silent a moment
Luck again
he whispered
The winds in your face Jim
The horses wont scent you
Go slow
Dont crack a stone
Keep close under the wall
Try to get up as high as this at the other end
Wait till daylight before riskin a loose slope
Ill be ridin the job early
Thats all
Ladds cool easy speech was scarcely significant of the perilous undertaking
Lash moved very slowly away leading his horse
The soft pads of hoofs ceased to sound about the time the gray shape merged into the black shadows
Then Ladd touched Dicks arm and turned back up the trail
But Dick tarried a moment
He wanted a fuller sense of that ebonybottomed abyss with its pale encircling walls reaching up to the dusky blue sky and the brilliant stars
There was absolutely no sound
He retraced his steps down soon coming up with Ladd and together they picked a way back through the winding recesses of cliff
The campfire was smoldering
Ladd replenished it and lay down to get a few hours sleep while Gale kept watch
The after part of the night wore on till the paling of stars the thickening of gloom indicated the dark hour before dawn
The spot was secluded from wind but the air grew cold as ice
Gale spent the time stripping wood from a dead mesquite in pacing to and fro in listening
Blanco Sol stamped occasionally which sound was all that broke the stilliness
Ladd awoke before the faintest gray appeared
The rangers ate and drank
When the black did lighten to gray they saddled the horses and led them out to the pass and down to the point where they had parted with Lash
Here they awaited daylight
To Gale it seemed long in coming
Such a delay always aggravated the slow fire within him
He had nothing of Ladds patience
He wanted action
The gray shadow below thinned out and the patch of mesquite made a blot upon the pale valley
The day dawned
Still Ladd waited
He grew more silent grimmer as the time of action approached
Gale wondered what the plan of attack would be
Yet he did not ask
He waited ready for orders
The valley grew clear of gray shadow except under leaning walls on the eastern side
Then a straight column of smoke rose from among the mesquites
Manifestly this was what Ladd had been awaiting
He took the long 405 from its sheath and tried the lever
Then he lifted a cartridge belt from the pommel of his saddle
Every ring held a shell and these shells were four inches long
He buckled the belt round him
Come on Dick
Ladd led the way down the slope until he reached a position that commanded the rising of the trail from a level
It was the only place a man or horse could leave the valley for the pass
Dick heres your stand
If any raider rides in range take a crack at himNow I want the lend of your hoss
Blanco Sol
exclaimed Gale more in amazement that Ladd should ask for the horse than in reluctance to lend him
Will you let me have him
Ladd repeated almost curtly
Certainly Laddy
A smile momentarily chased the dark cold gloom that had set upon the rangers lean face
Shore I appreciate it Dick
I know how you care for that hoss
I guess mebbe Charlie Ladd has loved a hoss
An one not so good as Sol
I was only tryin your nerve Dick askin you without tellin my plan
Sol wont get a scratch you can gamble on that
Ill ride him down into the valley an pull the greasers out in the open
Theyve got shortranged carbines
They cant keep out of range of the 405 an Ill be takin the dust of their lead
Sabe senor
Laddy
Youll run Sol away from the raiders when they chase you
Run him after them when they try to get away
Shore
Ill run all the time
They cant gain on Sol an hell run them down when I want
Can you beat it
No
Its greatBut suppose a raider comes out on Blanco Diablo
I reckon thats the one weak place in my plan
Im figgerin theyll never think of that till its too late
But if they do well Sol can outrun Diablo
An I can always kill the white devil
Ladds strange hate of the horse showed in the passion of his last words in his hardening jaw and grim set lips
Gales hand went swiftly to the rangers shoulder
Laddy
Dont kill Diablo unless its to save your life
All right
But by God if I get a chance Ill make Blanco Sol run him off his legs
He spoke no more and set about changing the length of Sols stirrups
When he had them adjusted to suit he mounted and rode down the trail and out upon the level
He rode leisurely as if merely going to water his horse
The long black rifle lying across his saddle however was ominous
Gale securely tied the other horse to a mesquite at hand and took a position behind a low rock over which he could easily see and shoot when necessary
He imagined Jim Lash in a similar position at the far end of the valley blocking the outlet
Gale had grown accustomed to danger and the hard and fierce feelings peculiar to it
But the coming drama was so peculiarly different in promise from all he had experienced that he waited the moment of action with thrilling intensity
In him stirred long brooding wrath at these border raidersaffection for Belding and keen desire to avenge the outrages he had sufferedwarm admiration for the cold implacable Ladd and his absolute fearlessness and a curious throbbing interest in the old muchdiscussed and neverdecided argument as to whether Blanco Sol was fleeter stronger horse than Blanco Diablo
Gale felt that he was to see a race between these great rivalsthe kind of race that made men and horses terrible
Ladd rode a quarter of a mile out upon the flat before anything happened
Then a whistle rent the still cold air
A horse had seen or scented Blanco Sol
The whistle was prolonged faint but clear
It made the boood thrum in Gales ears
Sol halted
His head shot up with the old wild spirited sweep
Gale leveled his glass at the patch of mesquites
He saw the raiders running to an open place pointing gesticulating
The glass brought them so close that he saw the dark faces
Suddenly they broke and fled back among the trees
Then he got only white and dark gleams of moving bodies
Evidently that moment was one of boots guns and saddles for the raiders
Lowering the glass Gale saw that Blanco Sol had started forward again
His gait was now a canter and he had covered another quarter of a mile before horses and raiders appeared upon the outskirts of the mesquites
Then Blanco Sol stopped
His shrill ringing whistle came distinctly to Gales ears
The raiders were mounted on dark horses and they stood abreast in a motionless line
Gale chuckled as he appreciated what a puzzle the situation presented for them
A lone horseman in the middle of the valley did not perhaps seem so menacing himself as the possibilities his presence suggested
Then Gale saw a raider gallop swiftly from the group toward the farther outlet of the valley
This might have been owing to characteristic cowardice but it was more likely a move of the raiders to make sure of retreat
Undoubtedly Ladd saw this galloping horseman
A few waiting moments ensued
The galloping horseman reached the slope began to climb
With naked eyes Gale saw a puff of white smoke spring out of the rocks
Then the raider wheeled his plunging horse back to the level and went racing wildly down the valley
The compact bunch of bays and blacks seemed to break apart and spread rapidly from the edge of the mesquites
Puffs of white smoke indicated firing and showed the nature of the raiders excitement
They were far out of ordinary range but they spurred toward Ladd shooting as they rode
Ladd held his ground the big white horse stood like a rock in his tracks
Gale saw little spouts of dust rise in front of Blanco Sol and spread swift as sight to his rear
The raiders bullets striking low were skipping along the hard bare floor of the valley
Then Ladd raised the long rifle
There was no smoke but three high spanging reports rang out
A gap opened in the dark line of advancing horsemen then a riderless steed sheered off to the right
Blanco Sol seemed to turn as on a pivot and charged back toward the lower end of the valley
He circled over to Gales right and stretched out into his run
There were now five raiders in pursuit and they came sweeping down yelling and shooting evidently sure of their quarry
Ladd reserved his fire
He kept turning from back to front in his saddle
Gale saw how the space widened between pursuers and pursued saw distinctly when Ladd eased up Sols running
Manifestly Ladd intended to try to lead the raiders round in front of Gales position and presently Gale saw he was going to succeed
The raiders riding like vaqueros swept on in a curve cutting off what distance they could
One fellow a small wiry rider high on his mounts neck like a jockey led his companions by many yards
He seemed to be getting the range of Ladd or else he shot high for his bullets did not strike up the dust behind Sol
Gale was ready to shoot
Blanco Sol pounded by his rapid rhythmic hoofbeats plainly to be heard
He was running easily
Gale tried to still the jump of heart and pulse and turned his eye again on the nearest pursuer
This raider was crossing in his carbine held muzzle up in his right hand and he was coming swiftly
It was a long shot upward of five hundred yards
Gale had not time to adjust the sights of the Remington but he knew the gun and holding coarsely upon the swiftly moving blot he began to shoot
The first bullet sent up a great splash of dust beneath the horses nose making him leap as if to hurdle a fence
The rifle was automatic Gale needed only to pull the trigger
He saw now that the raiders behind were in line
Swiftly he worked the trigger
Suddenly the leading horse leaped convulsively not up nor aside but straight ahead and then he crashed to the ground throwing his rider like a catapult and then slid and rolled
He half got up fell back and kicked but his rider never moved
The other rangers sawed the reins of plunging steeds and whirled to escape the unseen battery
Gale slipped a fresh clip into the magazine of his rifle
He restrained himself from useless firing and gave eager eye to the duel below
Ladd began to shoot while Sol was running
The 405 rang out sharplythen again
The heavy bullets streaked the dust all the way across the valley
Ladd aimed deliberately and pulled slowly unmindful of the kicking dustpuffs behind Sol and to the side
The raiders spurred madly in pursuit loading and firing
They shot ten times while Ladd shot once and all in vain and on Ladds sixth shot a raider topped backward threw his carbine and fell with his foot catching in a stirrup
The frightened horse plunged away dragging him in a path of dust
Gale had set himself to miss nothing of that fighting race yet the action passed too swiftly for clear sight of all
Ladd had emptied a magazine and now Blanco Sol quickened and lengthened his running stride
He ran away from his pursuers
Then it was that the rangers ruse was divined by the raiders
They hauled sharply up and seemed to be conferring
But that was a fatal mistake
Blanco Sol was seen to break his gait and slow down in several jumps then square away and stand stockstill
Ladd fired at the closely grouped raiders
An instant passed
Then Gale heard the spat of a bullet out in front saw a puff of dust then heard the lead strike the rocks and go whining away
And it was after this that one of the raiders fell prone from his saddle
The steeljacketed 405 had gone through him on its uninterrupted way to hum past Gales positon
The remaining two raiders frantically spurred their horses and fled up the valley
Ladd sent Sol after them
It seemed to Gale even though he realized his excitement that Blanco Sol made those horses seem like snails
The raiders split one making for the eastern outlet the other circling back of the mesquites
Ladd kept on after the latter
Then puffs of white smoke and rifle shots faintly crackling told Jim Lashs hand in the game
However he succeeded only in driving the raider back into the valley
But Ladd had turned the other horseman and now it appeared the two raiders were between Lash above on the stony slope and Ladd below on the level
There was desperate riding on part of the raiders to keep from being hemmed in closer
Only one of them got away and he came riding for life down under the eastern wall
Blanco Sol settled into his graceful beautiful swing
He gained steadily though he was far from extending himself
By Gales actual count the raider fired eight times in that race down the valley and all his bullets went low and wide
He pitched the carbine away and lost all control in headlong flight
Some few hundred rods to the left of Gale the raider put his horse to the weathered slope
He began to climb
The horse was superb infinitely more courageous than his rider
Zigzag they went up and up and when Ladd reached the edge of the slope they were high long the cracked and guttered rampart
Oncetwice Ladd raised the long rifle but each time he lowered it
Gale divined that the rangers restraint was not on account of the Mexican but for that valiant and faithful horse
Up and up he went and the yellow dust clouds rose and an avalanche rolled rattling and cracking down the slope
It was beyond belief that a horse burdened or unburdened could find footing and hold it upon that wall of narrow ledges and inverted slanting gullies
But he climbed on surefooted as a mountain goat and surmounting the last rough steps he stood a moment silhouetted against the white sky
Then he disappeared
Ladd sat astride Blanco Sol gazing upward
How the cowboy must have honored that raiders brave steed
Gale who had been too dumb to shout the admiration he felt suddenly leaped up and his voice came with a shriek LOOK OUT LADDY
A big horse like a white streak was bearing down to the right of the ranger
Blanco Diablo
A matchless rider swung with the horses motion
Gale was stunned
Then he remembered the first raider the one Lash had shot at and driven away from the outlet
This fellow had made for the mesquite and had put a saddle on Beldings favorite
In the heat of the excitement while Ladd had been intent upon the climbing horse this last raider had come down with the speed of the wind straight for the western outlet
Perhaps very probably he did not know Gale was there to block it and certainly he hoped to pass Ladd and Blanco Sol
A touch of the spur made Sol lunge forward to head off the raider
Diable was in his stride but the distance and angle favored Sol
The raider had no carbine
He held aloft a gun ready to level it and fire
He sat the saddle as if it were a stationary seat
Gale saw Ladd lean down and drop the 405 in the sand
He would take no chances of wounding Beldings bestloved horse
Then Gale sat transfixed with suspended breath watching the horses thundering toward him
Blanco Diablo was speeding low fleet as an antelope fierce and terrible in his devilish action a horse for war and blood and death
He seemed unbeatable
Yet to see the magnificently running Blanco Sol was but to court a doubt
Gale stood spellbound
He might have shot the raider but he never thought of such a thing
The distance swiftly lessened
Plain it was the raider could not make the opening ahead of Ladd
He saw it and swerved to the left emptying his sixshooter as he turned
His dark face gleamed as he flashed by Gale
Blanco Sol thundered across
Then the race became straight away up the valley
Diablo was cold and Sol was hot therein lay the only handicap and vantage
It was a fleet beautiful magnificent race
Gale thrilled and exulted and yelled as his horse settled into a steadily swifter run and began to gain
The dust rolled in a funnelshaped cloud from the flying hoofs
The raider wheeled with gun puffing white and Ladd ducked low over the neck of his horse
The gap between Diablo and Sol narrowed yard by yard
At first it had been a wide one
The raider beat his mount and spurred beat and spurred wheeled round to shoot then bent forward again
In his circle at the upper end of the valley he turned far short of the jumble of rocks
All the devil that was in Blanco Diablo had its running on the downward stretch
The strange cruel urge of bit and spur the crazed rider who stuck like a burr upon him the shots and smoke added terror to his natural violent temper
He ran himself off his feet
But he could not elude that relentless horse behind him
The running of Blanco Sol was that of a sure remorseless driving powersteadierstrongerswifter with every long and wonderful stride
The raider tried to sheer Diablo off closer under the wall to make the slope where his companion had escaped
But Diablo was uncontrollable
He was running wild with breaking gait
Closer and closer crept that white smoothly gliding beautiful machine of speed
Then like one white flash following another the two horses gleamed down the bank of a wash and disappeared in clouds of dust
Gale watched with strained and smarting eyes
The thick throb in his ears was pierced by faint sounds of gunshots
Then he waited in almost unendurable suspense
Suddenly something whiter than the background of dust appeared above the low roll of valley floor
Gale leveled his glass
In the clear circle shone Blanco Sols noble head with its long black bar from ears to nose
Sols head was drooping now
Another second showed Ladd still in the saddle
The ranger was leading Blanco Diablespentbrokendragging riderless
IX An Interrupted Siesta No man ever had a more eloquent and beautiful pleader for his cause than had Dick Gale in Mercedes Castaneda
He peeped through the green shining twigs of the palo verde that shaded his door
The hour was high noon and the patio was sultry
The only sounds were the hum of bees in the flowers and the low murmur of the Spanish girls melodious voice
Nell lay in the hammock her hands behind her head with rosy cheeks and arch eyes
Indeed she looked rebellious
Certain it was Dick reflected that the young lady had fully recovered the wilful personality which had lain dormant for a while
Equally certain it seemed that Mercedess earnestness was not apparently having the effect it should have had
Dick was inclined to be rebellious himself
Belding had kept the rangers in off the line and therefore Dick had been idle most of the time and though he tried hard he had been unable to stay far from Nells vicinity
He believed she cared for him but he could not catch her alone long enough to verify his tormenting hope
When alone she was as illusive as a shadow as quick as a flash as mysterious as a Yaqui
When he tried to catch her in the garden or fields or corner her in the patio she eluded him and left behind a memory of darkblue haunting eyes
It was that look in her eyes which lent him hope
At other times when it might have been possible for Dick to speak Nell clung closely to Mercedes
He had long before enlisted the loyal Mercedes in his cause but in spite of this Nell had been more than a match for them both
Gale pondered over an idea he had long revolved in mind and which now suddenly gave place to a decision that made his heart swell and his cheek burn
He peeped again through the green branches to see Nell laughing at the fiery Mercedes
Quien sabe he called mockingly and was delighted with Nells quick amazed start
Then he went in search of Mrs Belding and found her busy in the kitchen
The relation between Gale and Mrs Belding had subtly and incomprehensively changed
He understood her less than when at first he divined an antagonism in her
If such a thing were possible she had retained the antagonism while seeming to yield to some influence that must have been fondness for him
Gale was in no wise sure of her affection and he had long imagined she was afraid of him or of something that he represented
He had gone on openly and fairly though discreetly with his rather onesided love affair and as time passed he had grown less conscious of what had seemed her unspoken opposition
Gale had come to care greatly for Nells mother
Not only was she the comfort and strength of her home but also of the inhabitants of Forlorn River
Indian Mexican American were all the same to her in trouble or illness and then she was nurse doctor peacemaker helper
She was good and noble and there was not a child or grownup in Forlorn River who did not love and bless her
But Mrs Belding did not seem happy
She was brooding intense deep strong eager for the happiness and welfare of others and she was dominated by a worship of her daughter that was as strange as it was pathetic
Mrs Belding seldom smiled and never laughed
There was always a soft sad hurt look in her eyes
Gale often wondered if there had been other tragedy in her life than the supposed loss of her father in the desert
Perhaps it was the very unsolved nature of that loss which made it haunting
Mrs Belding heard Dicks step as he entered the kitchen and looking up greeted him
Mother began Dick earnestly
Belding called her that and so did Ladd and Lash but it was the first time for Dick
Mother I want to speak to you
The only indication Mrs Belding gave of being started was in her eyes which darkened shadowed with multiplying thought
I love Nell went on Dick simply and I want you to let me ask her to be my wife
Mrs Beldings face blanched to a deathly white
Gale thinking with surprise and concern that she was going to faint moved quickly toward her took her arm
Forgive me
I was bluntBut I thought you knew
Ive known for a long time replied Mrs Belding
Her voice was steady and there was no evidence of agitation except in her pallor
Then youyou havent spoken to Nell
Dick laughed
Ive been trying to get a chance to tell her
I havent had it yet
But she knows
There are other ways besides speech
And Mercedes has told her
I hope I almost believe Nell cares a little for me
Ive known that too for a long time said Mrs Belding low almost as a whisper
You know
cried Dick with a glow and rush of feeling
Dick you must be very blind not to see what has been plain to all of usI guessit couldnt have been helped
Youre a splendid fellow
No wonder she loves you
Mother
Youll give her to me
She drew him to the light and looked with strange piercing intentness into his face
Gale had never dreamed a womans eyes could hold such a world of thought and feeling
It seemed all the sweetness of life was there and all the pain
Do you love her
she asked
With all my heart
You want to marry her
Ah I want to
As much as I want to live and work for her
When would you marry her
WhyJust as soon as she will do it
Tomorrow
Dick gave a wild exultant little laugh
Dick Gale you want my Nell
You love her just as she isher sweetnessher goodness
Just herself body and soulTheres nothing could change younothing
Dear Mrs Belding I love Nell for herself
If she loves me Ill be the happiest of men
Theres absolutely nothing that could make any difference in me
But your people
Oh Dick you come of a proud family
I can tell
II once knew a young man like you
A few months cant change prideblood
Years cant change them
Youve become a ranger
You love the adventurethe wild life
That wont last
Perhaps youll settle down to ranching
I know you love the West
But Dick theres your family If you want to know anything about my family Ill tell you interrupted Dick with strong feeling
Ive not secrets about them or myself
My future and happiness are Nells to make
No one else shall count with me
Then Dickyou may have her
Godblessyouboth
Mrs Beldings strained face underwent a swift and mobile relaxation and suddenly she was weeping in strangely mingled happiness and bitterness
Why mother
Gale could say no more
He did not comprehend a mood seemingly so utterly at variance with Mrs Beldings habitual temperament
But he put his arm around her
In another moment she had gained command over herself and kissing him she pushed him out of the door
There
Go tell her DickAnd have some spunk about it
Gale went thoughtfully back to his room
He vowed that he would answer for Nells happiness if he had the wonderful good fortune to win her
Then remembering the hope Mrs Belding had given him Dick lost his gravity in a flash and something began to dance and ring within him
He simply could not keep his steps turned from the patio
Every path led there
His blood was throbbing his hopes mounting his spirit soaring
He knew he had never before entered the patio with that inspirited presence
Now for some spunk
he said under his breath
Plainly he meant his merry whistle and his buoyant step to interrupt this first languorous stage of the siesta which the girls always took during the hot hours
Nell had acquired the habit long before Mercedes came to show how fixed a thing it was in the life of the tropics
But neither girl heard him
Mercedes lay under the palo verde her beautiful head dark and still upon a cushion
Nell was asleep in the hammock
There was an abandonment in her deep repose and a faint smile upon her face
Her sweet red lips with the soft perfect curve had always fascinated Dick and now drew him irresistibly
He had always been consumed with a desire to kiss her and now he was overwhelmed with his opportunity
It would be a terrible thing to do but if she did not awaken at once No he would fight the temptation
That would be more than spunk
It would Suddenly an ugly green fly sailed low over Nell appeared about to alight on her
Noiselessly Dick stepped close to the hammock bent under the tree and with a sweep of his hand chased the intruding fly away
But he found himself powerless to straighten up
He was close to herbending over her facenear the sweet lips
The insolent dreaming smile just parted them
Then he thought he was lost
But she stirredhe feared she would awaken
He had stepped back erect when she opened her eyes
They were sleepy yet surprised until she saw him
Then she was wide awake in a second bewildered uncertain
Whyyou here
she asked slowly
Large as life
replied Dick with unusual gayety
How long have you been here
Just got here this fraction of a second he replied lying shamelessly
It was evident that she did not know whether or not to believe him and as she studied him a slow blush dyed her cheek
You are absolutely truthful when you say you just stepped there
Why of course answered Dick right glad he did not have to lie about that
I thoughtI wasdreaming she said and evidently the sound of her voice reassured her
Yes you looked as if you were having pleasant dreams replied Dick
So sorry to wake you
I cant see how I came to do it I was so quiet
Mercedes didnt wake
Well Ill go and let you have your siesta and dreams
But he did not move to go
Nell regarded him with curious speculative eyes
Isnt it a lovely day
queried Dick
I think its hot
Only ninety in the shade
And youve told me the mercury goes to one hundred and thirty in midsummer
This is just a glorious golden day
Yesterday was finer but you didnt notice it
Oh yesterday was somewhere back in the pastthe inconsequential past
Nells sleepy blue eyes opened a little wider
She did not know what to make of this changed young man
Dick felt gleeful and tried hard to keep the fact from becoming manifest
Whats the inconsequential past
You seem remarkably happy today
I certainly am happy
Adios
Pleasant dreams
Dick turned away then and left the patio by the opening into the yard
Nell was really sleepy and when she had fallen asleep again he would return
He walked around for a while
Belding and the rangers were shoeing a broncho
Yaqui was in the field with the horses
Blanco Sol grazed contently and now and then lifted his head to watch
His long ears went up at sight of his master and he whistled
Presently Dick as if magnetdrawn retraced his steps to the patio and entered noiselessly
Nell was now deep in her siesta
She was inert relaxed untroubled by dreams
Her hair was damp on her brow
Again Nell stirred and gradually awakened
Her eyes unclosed humid shadowy unconscious
They rested upon Dick for a moment before they became clear and comprehensive
He stood back fully ten feet from her and to all outside appearances regarded her calmly
Ive interrupted your siesta again he said
Please forgive me
Ill take myself off
He wandered away and when it became impossible for him to stay away any longer he returned to the patio
The instant his glance rested upon Nells face he divined she was feigning sleep
The faint roseblush had paled
The warm rich golden tint of her skin had fled
Dick dropped upon his knees and bent over her
Though his blood was churning in his veins his breast laboring his mind whirling with the wonder of that moment and its promise he made himself deliberate
He wanted more than anything he had ever wanted in his life to see if she would keep up that pretense of sleep and let him kiss her
She must have felt his breath for her hair waved off her brow
Her cheeks were now white
Her breast swelled and sank
He bent down closercloser
But he must have been maddeningly slow for as he bent still closer Nells eyes opened and he caught a swift purple gaze of eyes as she whirled her head
Then with a little cry she rose and fled
Rojas No word from George Thorne had come to Forlorn River in weeks
Gale grew concerned over the fact and began to wonder if anything serious could have happened to him
Mercedes showed a slow wearing strain
Thornes commission expired the end of January and if he could not get his discharge immediately he surely could obtain leave of absence
Therefore Gale waited not without growing anxiety and did his best to cheer Mercedes
The first of February came bringing news of rebel activities and bandit operations in and around Casita but not a word from the cavalryman
Mercedes became silent mournful
Her eyes were great black windows of tragedy
Nell devoted herself entirely to the unfortunate girl Dick exerted himself to persuade her that all would yet come well in fact the whole household could not have been kinder to a sister or a daughter
But their united efforts were unavailing
Mercedes seemed to accept with fatalistic hopelessness a last and crowning misfortune
A dozen times Gale declared he would ride in to Casita and find out why they did not hear from Thorne however older and wiser heads prevailed over his impetuosity
Belding was not sanguine over the safety of the Casita trail
Refugees from there arrived every day in Forlorn River and if tales they told were true real war would have been preferable to what was going on along the border
Belding and the rangers and the Yaqui held a consultation
Not only had the Indian become a faithful servant to Gale but he was also of value to Belding
Yaqui had all the craft of his class and superior intelligence
His knowledge of Mexicans was second only to his hate of them
And Yaqui who had been scouting on all the trails gave information that made Belding decide to wait some days before sending any one to Casita
He required promises from his rangers particularly Gale not to leave without his consent
It was upon Gales coming from this conference that he encountered Nell
Since the interrupted siesta episode she had been more than ordinarily elusive and about all he had received from her was a tantalizing smile from a distance
He got the impression now however that she had awaited him
When he drew close to her he was certain of it and he experienced more than surprise
Dick she began hurriedly
Dads not going to send any one to see about Thorne
No not yet
He thinks it best not to
We all think so
Im sorry
Poor Mercedes
I knew it
I tried to coax him to send Laddy or even Yaqui
He wouldnt listen to me
Dick Mercedes is dying by inches
Cant you see what ails her
Its more than love or fear
Its uncertaintysuspense
Oh cant we find out for her
Nell I feel as badly as you about her
I wanted to ride in to Casita
Belding shut me up quick the last time
Nell came close to Gale clasped his arm
There was no color in her face
Her eyes held a dark eager excitement
Dick will you slip off without Dads consent
Risk it
Go to Casita and find out whats happened to Thorneat least if he ever started for Forlorn River
No Nell I wont do that
She drew away from him with passionate suddenness
Are you afraid
This certainly was not the Nell Burton that Gale knew
No Im not afraid Gale replied a little nettled
Will you gofor my sake
Like lightning her mood changed and she was close to him again hands on his her face white her whole presence sweetly alluring
Nell I wont disobey Belding protested Gale
I wont break my word
Dick itll not be so bad as that
Butwhat if it isGo Dick if not for poor Mercedess sake then for mineto please me
IllIllyou wont lose anything by going
I think I know how Mercedes feels
Just a word from Thorne or about him would save her
Take Blanco Sol and go Dick
What rebel outfit could ever ride you down on that horse
Why Dick if I was up on Sol I wouldnt be afraid of the whole rebel army
My dear girl its not a question of being afraid
Its my wordmy duty to Belding
You said you loved me
If you love me you will goYou dont love me
Gale could only stare at this transformed girl
Dick listenIf you goif you fetch some word of Thorne to comfort Mercedes youwell you will have your reward
Nell
Her dangerous sweetness was as amazing as this newly revealed character
Dick will you go
Nono
cried Gale in violence struggling with himself
Nell Burton Ill tell you this
To have the reward I want would mean pretty hear heaven for me
But not even for that will I break my word to your father
She seemed the incarnation of girlish scorn and wilful passion
Gracias senor she replied mockingly
Adios
Then she flashed out of his sight
Gale went to his room at once disturbed and thrilling and did not soon recover from that encounter
The following morning at the breakfast table Nell was not present
Mrs Belding evidently considered the fact somewhat unusual for she called out into the patio and then into the yard
Then she went to Mercedess room
But Nell was not there either
Shes in one of her tantrums lately said Belding
Wouldnt speak to me this morning
Let her alone mother
Shes spoiled enough without running after her
Shes always hungry
Shell be on hand presently dont mistake me
Notwithstanding Beldings conviction which Gale shared Nell did not appear at all during the hour
When Belding and the rangers went outside Yaqui was eating his meal on the bench where he always sat
YaquiLluvia d oro si
asked Belding waving his hand toward the corrals
The Indians beautiful name for Nell meant shower of gold and Belding used it in asking Yaqui if he had seen her
He received a negative reply
Perhaps half an hour afterward as Gale was leaving his room he saw the Yaqui running up the path from the fields
It was markedly out of the ordinary to see the Indian run
Gale wondered what was the matter
Yaqui ran straight to Belding who was at work at his bench under the wagon shed
In less than a moment Belding was bellowing for his rangers
Gale got to him first but Ladd and Lash were not far behind
Blanco Sol gone
yelled Belding in a rage
Gone
In broad daylight with the Indian awatchin
queried Ladd
It happened while Yaqui was at breakfast
Thats sure
Hed just watered Sol
Raiders
exclaimed Jim Lash
Lord only knows
Yaqui says it wasnt raiders
Mebbe Sols just walked off somewheres
He was haltered in the corral
Send Yaqui to find the hosss trail an lets figger said Ladd
Shore this s no raider job
In the swift search that ensued Gale did not have anything to say but his mind was forming a conclusion
When he found his old saddle and bridle missing from the peg in the barn his conclusion became a positive conviction and it made him for the moment cold and sick and speechless
Hey Dick dont take it so much to heart said Belding
Well likely find Sol and if we dont theres other good horses
Im not thinking of Sol replied Gale
Ladd cast a sharp glance at Gale snapped his fingers and said Damn me if I aint guessed it too
Whats wrong with you locoed gents
bluntly demanded Belding
Nell has slipped away on Sol answered Dick
There was a blank pause which presently Belding broke
Well thats all right if Nells on him
I was afraid wed lost the horse
Belding youre trackin bad said Ladd wagging his head
Nell has started for Casita burst out Gale
She has gone to fetch Mercedes some word about Thorne
Oh Belding you neednt shake your head
I know shes gone
She tried to persuade me to go and was furious when I wouldnt
I dont believe it replied Belding hoarsely
Nell may have her temper
Shes a little devil at times but she always had good sense
Tom you can gamble shes gone said Ladd
Aw hell no
Jim what do you think
implored Belding
I reckon Sols white head is pointed level an straight down the Casita trail
An Nell can ride
Were losing time
That roused Belding to action
I say youre all wrong he yelled starting for the corrals
Shes only taking a little ride same as shes done often
But rustle now
Find out
Dick you ride cross the valley
Jim you hunt up and down the river
Ill head up San Felipe way
And you Laddy take Diablo and hit the Casita trail
If she really has gone after Thorne you can catch her in an hour or so
Shore Ill go replied Ladd
but Beldin if youre not plumb crazy youre close to it
That big white devil cant catch Sol
Not in an hour or a day or a week
Whats more at the end of any runnin time with an even start Sol will be farther in the lead
An now Sols got an hours start
Laddy you mean to say Sol is a faster horse than Diablo
thundered Belding his face purple
Shore
I mean to tell you just that there replied the ranger
IllIll bet a Were wastin time curtly interrupted Ladd
You can gamble on this if you want to
Ill ride your Blanco Devil as he never was rid before cept once when a damn sight better hossman than I am couldnt make him outrun Sol
Without more words the men saddled and were off not waiting for the Yaqui to come in with possible information as to what trail Blanco Sol had taken
It certainly did not show in the clear sand of the level valley where Gale rode to and fro
When Gale returned to the house he found Belding and Lash awaiting him
They did not mention their own search but stated that Yaqui had found Blanco Sols tracks in the Casita trail
After some consultation Belding decided to send Lash along after Ladd
The interminable time that followed contained for Gale about as much suspense as he could well bear
What astonished him and helped him greatly to fight off actual distress was the endurance of Nells mother
Early on the morning of the second day Gale who had acquired an unbreakable habit of watching saw three white horses and a bay come wearily stepping down the road
He heard Blanco Sols familiar whistle and he leaped up wild with joy
The horse was riderless
Gales sudden joy received a violent check then resurged when he saw a limp white form in Jim Lashs arms
Ladd was supporting a horseman who wore a military uniform
Gale shouted with joy and ran into the house to tell the good news
It was the everthoughtful Mrs Belding who prevented him from rushing in to tell Mercedes
Then he hurried out into the yard closely followed by the Beldings
Lash handed down a ragged travelstained wan girl into Beldings arms
Dad
Mama
It was indeed a repentant Nell but there was spirit yet in the tired blue eyes
Then she caught sight of Gale and gave him a faint smile
HelloDick
Nell
Gale reached for her hand held it tightly and found speech difficult
You neednt worryabout your old horse she said as Belding carried her toward the door
Oh Dick
Blanco Sol isglorious
Gale turned to greet his friend
Indeed it was but a haggard ghost of the cavalryman
Thorne looked ill or wounded
Gales greeting was also a question full of fear
Thornes answer was a faint smile
He seemed ready to drop from the saddle
Gale helped Ladd hold Thorne upon the horse until they reached the house
Belding came out again
His welcome was checked as he saw the condition of the cavalryman
Thorne reeled into Dicks arms
But he was able to stand and walk
Im nothurt
Only weakstarved he said
Is Mercedes Take me to her
Shell be well the minute she sees him averred Belding as he and Gale led the cavalryman to Mercedess room
There they left him and Gale at least felt his ears ringing with the girls broken cry of joy
When Belding and Gale hurried forth again the rangers were tending the tired horses
Upon returning to the house Jim Lash calmly lit his pipe and Ladd declared that hungry as he was he had to tell his story
Shore Beldin began Ladd that was funny about Diablo catchin Blanco Sol
Funny aint the word
I nearly laughed myself to death
Well I rode in Sols tracks all the way to Casita
Never seen a rebel or a raider till I got to town
Figgered Nell made the trip in five hours
I went straight to the camp of the cavalrymen an found them just coolin off an dressin down their hosses after what looked to me like a big ride
I got there too late for the fireworks
Some soldier took me to an officers tent
Nell was there some white an all in
She just said Laddy
Thorne was there too an he was bein worked over by the camp doctor
I didnt ask no questions because I seen quiet was needed round that tent
After satisfying myself that Nell was all right an Thorne in no danger I went out
Shore there was so darn many fellers who wanted to an tried to tell me whatd come off I thought Id never find out
But I got the story piece by piece
An heres what happened
Nell rode Blanco Sol atearin into camp an had a crowd round her in a jiffy
She told who she was where shed come from an what she wanted
Well it seemed a day or so before Nell got there the cavalrymen had heard word of Thorne
You see Thorne had left camp on leave of absence some time before
He was shore mysterious they said an told nobody where he was goin
A week or so after he left camp some Greaser give it away that Rojas had a prisoner in a dobe shack near his camp
Nobody paid much attention to what the Greaser said
He wanted money for mescal
An it was usual for Rojas to have prisoners
But in a few more days it turned out pretty sure that for some reason Rojas was holdin Thorne
Now it happened when this news came Colonel Weede was in Nogales with his staff an the officer left in charge didnt know how to proceed
Rojass camp was across the line in Mexico an ridin over there was serious business
It meant a whole lot more than just scatterin one Greaser camp
It was what had been botherin moren one colonel along the line
Thornes feller soldiers was anxious to get him out of a bad fix but they had to wait for orders
When Nell found out Thorne was bein starved an beat in a dobe shack no moren two mile across the line she shore stirred up that cavalry camp
Shore
She told them soldiers Rojas was holdin Thornetorturin him to make him tell where Mercedes was
She told about Mercedeshow sweet an beautiful she washow her father had been murdered by Rojashow she had been hounded by the bandithow ill an miserable she was waitin for her lover
An she begged the cavalrymen to rescue Thorne
From the way it was told to me I reckon them cavalrymen went up in the air
Fine fiery lot of young bloods I thought achin for a scrap
But the officer in charge bein in a ticklish place still held out for higher orders
Then Nell broke loose
Youall know Nells tongue is sometimes like a choya thorn
Id have give somethin to see her work up that soldier outfit
Nells never so pretty as when shes mad
An this last stunt of hers was no girly tantrum as Beldin calls it
She musta been ragin with all the hell theres in a womanCant you fellers see her on Blanco Sol with her eyes turnin black
Ladd mopped his sweaty face with his dusty scarf
He was beaming
He was growing excited hurried in his narrative
Right out then Nell swore shed go after Thorne
If them cavalrymen couldnt ride with a Western girl to save a brother Americanlet them hang back
One feller under orders tried to stop Blanco Sol
An that feller invited himself to the hospital
Then the cavalrymen went flyin for their hosses
Mebbe Nells move was just foxywomans cunnin
But Im thinkin as she felt then shed have sent Blanco Sol straight into Rojass camp which Id forgot to say was in plain sight
It didnt take long for every cavalryman in that camp to get wind of what was comin off
Shore they musta been wild
They strung out after Nell in a thunderin troop
Say I wish you fellers could see the lane that bunch of hosses left in the greasewood an cactus
Looks like thered been a cattle stampede on the desertBlanco Sol stayed out in front you can gamble on that
Right into Rojass camp
Sabe you senors
Gawd Almighty
I never had grief that d hold a candle to this one of bein too late to see Nell an Sol in their one best race
Rojas an his men vamoosed without a shot
That aint surprisin
There wasnt a shot fired by anybody
The cavalrymen soon found Thorne an hurried with him back on Uncle Sams land
Thorne was half naked black an blue all over thin as a rail
He looked mighty sick when I seen him first
That was a little after midday
He was given food an drink
Shore he seemed a starved man
But he picked up wonderful an by the time Jim came along he was wantin to start for Forlorn River
So was Nell
By main strength as much as persuasion we kept the two of them quiet till next evenin at dark
Well we made as sneaky a start in the dark as Jim an me could manage an never hit the trail till we was miles from town
Thornes nerve held him up for a while
Then all at once he tumbled out of his saddle
We got him back an Lash held him on
Nell didnt give out till daybreak
As Ladd paused in his story Belding began to stutter and finally he exploded
His mighty utterances were incoherent
But plainly the wrath he had felt toward the wilful girl was forgotten
Gale remained gripped by silence
I reckon youll all be some surprised when you see Casita went on Ladd
Its half burned an half tore down
An the rebels are livin fat
There was rumors of another federal force on the road from Case Grandes
I seen a good many Americans from interior Mexico an the stories they told would make your hair stand up
They all packed guns was fightin mad at Greasers an sore on the good old U S But shore glad to get over the line
Some were waitin for trains which dont run reglar no more an others were ready to hit the trails north
Laddy what knocks me is Rojas holding Thorne prisoner trying to make him tell where Mercedes had been hidden said Belding
Shore
It d knock anybody
The bandits crazy over her
Thats the Spanish of it replied Belding his voice rolling
Rojas is a peon
Hes been a slave to the proud Castilian
He loves Mercedes as he hates her
When I was down in Durango I saw something of these peons insane passions
Rojas wants this girl only to have her then kill her
Its damn strange boys and even with Thorne here our troubles have just begun
Tom you spoke correct said Jim Ladd in his cool drawl
Shore Im not sayin what I think added Ladd
But the look of him was not indicative of a tranquil optimism
Thorne was put to bed in Gales room
He was very weak yet he would keep Mercedess hand and gaze at her with unbelieving eyes
Mercedess failing hold on hope and strength seemed to have been a fantasy she was again vivid magnetic beautiful shot through and through with intense and throbbing life
She induced him to take food and drink
Then fighting sleep with what little strength he had left at last he succumbed
For all Dick could ascertain his friend never stirred an eyelash nor a finger for twentyseven hours
When he awoke he was pale weak but the old Thorne
Hello Dick I didnt dream it then he said
There you are and my darling with the proud dark eyesshes here
Why yes you locoed cavalryman
Say whats happened to you
It cant be those clothes and a little bronze on your faceDick youre olderyouve changed
Youre not so thickly built
By Gad if you dont look fine
Thanks
Im sorry I cant return the compliment
Youre about the seediest hungriestlooking fellow I ever sawSay old man you must have had a tough time
A dark and somber fire burned out the happiness in Thornes eyes
Dick dont make medont let me think of that fiend RojasIm here now
Ill be well in a day or two
Then
Mercedes came in radiant and softvoiced
She fell upon her knees beside Thornes bed and neither of them appeared to see Nell enter with a tray
Then Gale and Nell made a good deal of unnecessary bustle in moving a small table close to the bed
Mercedes had forgotten for the moment that her lover had been a starving man
If Thorne remembered it he did not care
They held hands and looked at each other without speaking
Nell I thought I had it bad whispered Dick
But Im not Hush
Its beautiful replied Nell softly and she tried to coax Dick from the room
Dick however thought he ought to remain at least long enough to tell Thorne that a man in his condition could not exist solely upon love
Mercedes sprang up blushing with pretty penitent manner and moving white hands eloquent of her condition
Oh Mercedesdont go
cried Thorne as she stepped to the door
Senor Dick will stay
He is not mucha malo for youas I am
Then she smiled and went out
Good Lord
exclaimed Thorne
How I love her
Dick isnt she the most beautiful the loveliest the finest George I share your enthusiasm said Dick dryly but Mercedes isnt the only girl on earth
Manifestly this was a startling piece of information and struck Thorne in more than one way
George went on Dick did you happen to observe the girl who saved your lifewho incidentally just fetched in your breakfast
Nell Burton
Why of course
Shes brave a wonderful girl and really nicelooking
You long lean hungry beggar
That was the young lady who might answer the raving eulogy you just got out of your systemIwell you havent cornered the love market
Thorne uttered some kind of a sound that his weakened condition would not allow to be a whoop
Dick
Do you mean it
I shore do as Laddy says
Im glad Dick with all my heart
I wondered at the changed look you wear
Why boy youve got a different frontCall the lady in and you bet Ill look her over right
I can see better now
Eat your breakfast
Theres plenty of time to dazzle you afterward
Thorne fell to upon his breakfast and made it vanish with magic speed
Meanwhile Dick told him something of a rangers life along the border
You neednt waste your breath said Thorne
I guess I can see
Belding and those rangers have made you the real thingthe real Western goodsWhat I want to know is all about the girl
Well Laddy swears shes got your girl roped in the corral for looks
Thats not possible
Ill have to talk to LaddyBut she must be a wonder or Dick Gale would never have fallen for herIsnt it great Dick
Im here
Mercedes is wellsafe
Youve got a girl
OhBut say I havent a dollar to my name
I had a lot of money Dick and those robbers stole it my watcheverything
Damn that little black Greaser
He got Mercedess letters
I wish you could have seen him trying to read them
Hes simply nutty over her Dick
I could have borne the loss of money and valuablesbut those beautiful wonderful letterstheyre gone
Cheer up
You have the girl
Belding will make you a proposition presently
The future smiles old friend
If this rebel business was only ended
Dick youre going to be my savior twice overWell now listen to me
His gay excitement changed to earnet gravity
I want to marry Mercedes at once
Is there a padre here
Yes
But are you wise in letting any Mexican even a priest know Mercedes is hidden in Forlorn River
It couldnt be kept much longer
Gale was compelled to acknowledge the truth of this statement
Ill marry her first then Ill face my problem
Fetch the padre Dick
And ask our kind friends to be witnesses at the ceremony
Much to Gales surprise neither Belding nor Ladd objected to the idea of bringing a padre into the household and thereby making known to at least one Mexican the whereabouts of Mercedes Castaneda
Beldings caution was wearing out in wrath at the persistent unsettled condition of the border and Ladd grew only the cooler and more silent as possibilities of trouble multiplied
Gale fetched the padre a little weazened timid man who was old and without interest or penetration
Apparently he married Mercedes and Thorne as he told his beads or mumbled a prayer
It was Mrs Belding who kept the occasion from being a merry one and she insisted on not exciting Thorne
Gale marked her unusual pallor and the singular depth and sweetness of her voice
Mother whats the use of making a funeral out of a marriage
protested Belding
A chance for some fun doesnt often come to Forlorn River
Youre a fine doctor
Cant you see the girl is what Thorne needed
Hell be well tomorrow dont mistake me
George when youre all right again well add something to present congratulations said Gale
We shore will put in Ladd
So with parting jests and smiles they left the couple to themselves
Belding enjoyed a laugh at his good wifes expense for Thorne could not be kept in bed and all in a day it seemed he grew so well and so hungry that his friends were delighted and Mercedes was radiant
In a few days his weakness disappeared and he was going the round of the fields and looking over the ground marked out in Gales plan of water development
Thorne was highly enthusiastic and at once staked out his claim for one hundred and sixty acres of land adjoining that of Belding and the rangers
These five tracts took in all the ground necessary for their operations but in case of the success of the irrigation project the idea was to increase their squatter holdings by purchase of more land down the valley
A hundred families had lately moved to Forlorn River more were coming all the time and Belding vowed he could see a vision of the whole Altar Valley green with farms
Meanwhile everybody in Beldings household except the quiet Ladd and the watchful Yaqui in the absence of disturbance of any kind along the border grew freer and more unrestrained as if anxiety was slowly fading in the peace of the present
Jim Lash made a trip to the Sonoyta Oasis and Ladd patrolled fifty miles of the line eastward without incident or sight of raiders
Evidently all the border hawks were in at the picking of Casita
The February nights were cold with a dry icy penetrating coldness that made a warm fire most comfortable
Beldings household usually congregated in the sittingroom where burning mesquite logs crackled in the open fireplace
Beldings one passion besides horses was the game of checkers and he was always wanting to play
On this night he sat playing with Ladd who never won a game and never could give up trying
Mrs Belding worked with her needle stopping from time to time to gaze with thoughtful eyes into the fire
Jim Lash smoked his pipe by the hearth and played with the cat on his knee
Thorne and Mercedes were at the table with pencil and paper and he was trying his best to keep his attention from his wifes beautiful animated face long enough to read and write a little Spanish
Gale and Nell sat in a corner watching the bright fire
There came a low knock on the door
It may have been an ordinary knock for it did not disturb the women but to Belding and his rangers it had a subtle meaning
Whos that
asked Belding as he slowly pushed back his chair and looked at Ladd
Yaqui replied the ranger
Come in called Belding
The door opened and the short square powerfully built Indian entered
He had a magnificent head strangely staring somber black eyes and very darkly bronzed face
He carried a rifle and strode with impressive dignity
Yaqui what do you want
asked Belding and repeated his question in Spanish
Senor Dick replied the Indian
Gale jumped up stifling an exclamation and he went outdoors with Yaqui
He felt his arm gripped and allowed himself to be led away without asking a question
Yaquis presence was always one of gloom and now his stern action boded catastrophe
Once clear of trees he pointed to the level desert across the river where a row of campfires shone bright out of the darkness
Raiders
ejaculated Gale
Then he cautioned Yaqui to keep sharp lookout and hurriedly returning to the house he called the men out and told them there were rebels or raiders camping just across the line
Ladd did not say a word
Belding with an oath slammed down his cigar
I knew it was too good to lastDick you and Jim stay here while Laddy and I look around
Dick returned to the sittingroom
The women were nervous and not to be deceived
So Dick merely said Yaqui had sighted some lights off in the desert and they probably were campfires
Belding did not soon return and when he did he was alone and saying he wanted to consult with the men he sent Mrs Belding and the girls to their rooms
His gloomy anxiety had returned
Laddys gone over to scout around and try to find out who the outfit belongs to and how many are in it said Belding
I reckon if theyre raiders with bad intentions we wouldnt see no fires remarked Jim calmly
It d be useless I suppose to send for the cavalry said Gale
Whatevers coming off would be over before the soldiers could be notified let alone reach here
Hell fellows
I dont look for an attack on Forlorn River burst out Belding
I cant believe that possible
These rebelraiders have a little sense
They wouldnt spoil their game by pulling U S soldiers across the line from Yuma to El Paso
But as Jim says if they wanted to steal a few horses or cattle they wouldnt build fires
Im afraid its Belding hesitated and looked with grim concern at the cavalryman
What
queried Thorne
Im afraid its Rojas
Thorne turned pale but did not lose his nerve
I thought of that at once
If true itll be terrible for Mercedes and me
But Rojas will never get his hands on my wife
If I cant kill him Ill kill herBelding this is tough on youthis risk we put upon your family
I regret Cut that kind of talk replied Belding bluntly
Well if it is Rojas hes acting damn strange for a raider
Thats what worries me
We cant do anything but wait
With Laddy and Yaqui out there we wont be surprised
Lets take the best possible view of the situation until we know more
Thatll not likely be before tomorrow
The women of the house might have gotten some sleep that night but it was certain the men did not get any
Morning broke cold and gray the 19th of February
Breakfast was prepared earlier than usual and an air of suppressed waiting excitement pervaded the place
Otherwise the ordinary details of the mornings work continued as on any other day
Ladd came in hungry and cold and said the Mexicans were not breaking camp
He reported a goodsized force of rebels and was taciturn as to his idea of forthcoming events
About an hour after sunrise Yaqui ran in with the information that part of the rebels were crossing the river
That cant mean a fight yet declared Belding
But get in the house boys and make ready anyway
Ill meet them
Drive them off the place same as if you had a company of soldiers backin you said Ladd
Dont give them an inch
Were in bad and the bigger bluff we put up the more likely our chance
Belding youre an officer of the United States
Mexicans are much impressed by show of authority
Ive seen that often in camp said Thorne
Oh I know the whitelivered Greasers better than any of you dont mistake me replied Belding
He was pale with rage but kept command over himself
The rangers with Yaqui and Thorne stationed themselves at the several windows of the sittingroom
Rifles and smaller arms and boxes of shells littered the tables and window seats
No small force of besiegers could overcome a resistance such as Belding and his men were capable of making
Here they come boys called Gale from his window
Rebelraiders I should say Laddy
Shore
An a fine outfit of buzzards
Reckon theres about a dozen in the bunch observed the calm Lash
Some hosses theyre ridin
Where n the hell do they get such hosses anyhow
Shore Jim they work hard an buy em with real silver pesos replied Ladd sarcastically
Do any of you see Rojas
whispered Thorne
Nix
No dandy bandit in that outfit
Its too far to see said Gale
The horsemen halted at the corrals
They were orderly and showed no evidence of hostility
They were however fully armed
Belding stalked out to meet them
Apparently a leader wanted to parley with him but Belding would hear nothing
He shook his head waved his arms stamped to and fro and his loud angry voice could be heard clear back at the house
Whereupon the detachment of rebels retired to the bank of the river beyond the white post that marked the boundary line and there they once more drew rein
Belding remained by the corrals watching them evidently still in threatening mood
Presently a single rider left the troop and trotted his horse back down the road
When he reached the corrals he was seen to halt and pass something to Belding
Then he galloped away to join his comrades
Belding looked at whatever it was he held in his hand shook his burley head and started swiftly for the house
He came striding into the room holding a piece of soiled paper
Cant read it and dont know as I want to he said savagely
Beldin shore wed better read it replied Ladd
What we want is a line on them Greasers
Whether theyre Campos men or Salazars or just a wanderin bunch of rebelsor Rojass bandits
Sabe senor
Not one of the men was able to translate the garbled scrawl
Shore Mercedes can read it said Ladd
Thorne opened a door and called her
She came into the room followed by Nell and Mrs Belding
Evidently all three divined a critical situation
My dear we want you to read whats written on this paper said Thorne as he led her to the table
It was sent in by rebels andand we fear contains bad news for us
Mercedes gave the writing one swift glance then fainted in Thornes arms
He carried her to a couch and with Nell and Mrs Belding began to work over her
Belding looked at his rangers
It was characteristic of the man that now when catastrophe appeared inevitable all the gloom and care and angry agitation passed from him
Laddy its Rojas all right
How many men has he out there
Mebbe twenty
Not more
We can lick twice that many Greasers
Shore
Jim Lash removed his pipe long enough to speak
I reckon
But it aint sense to start a fight when mebbe we can avoid it
Whats your idea
Lets stave the Greaser off till dark
Then Laddy an me an Thorne will take Mercedes an hit the trail for Yuma
Camino del Diablo
That awful trail with a woman
Jim do you forget how many hundreds of men have perished on the Devils Road
I reckon I aint forgettin nothin replied Jim
The waterholes are full now
Theres grass an we can do the job in six days
Its three hundred miles to Yuma
Beldin Jims idea hits me pretty reasonable interposed Ladd
Lord knows thats about the only chance weve got except fightin
But suppose we do stave Rojas off and you get safely away with Mercedes
Isnt Rojas going to find it out quick
Then whatll he try to do to us whore left here
I reckon hed find out by daylight replied Jim
But Tom he aint agoin to start a scrap then
Hed want time an hosses an men to chase us out on the trail
You see Im figgerin on the crazy Greaser wantin the girl
I reckon hell try to clean up here to get her
But hes too smart to fight you for nothin
Rojas may be nutty about women but hes afraid of the U S Take my word for it hed discover the trail in the mornin an light out on it
I reckon with ten hours start we could travel comfortable
Belding paced up and down the room
Jim and Ladd whispered together
Gale walked to the window and looked out at the distant group of bandits and then turned his gaze to rest upon Mercedes
She was conscious now and her eyes seemed all the larger and blacker for the whiteness of her face
Thorne held her hands and the other women were trying to still her tremblings
No one but Gale saw the Yaqui in the background looking down upon the Spanish girl
All of Yaquis looks were strange but this singularly so
Gale marked it and felt he would never forget
Mercedess beauty had never before struck him as being so exquisite so alluring as now when she lay stricken
Gale wondered if the Indian was affected by her loveliness her helplessness or her terror
Yaqui had seen Mercedes only a few times and upon each of these he had appeared to be fascinated
Could the strange Indian because his hate for Mexicans was so great be gloating over her misery
Something about Yaquia noble austerity of countenancemade Gale feel his suspicion unjust
Presently Belding called his rangers to him and then Thorne
Listen to this he said earnestly
Ill go out and have a talk with Rojas
Ill try to reason with him tell him to think a long time before he sheds blood on Uncle Sams soil
That hes now after an Americans wife
Ill not commit myself nor will I refuse outright to consider his demands nor will I show the least fear of him
Ill play for time
If my bluff goes throughwell and goodAfter dark the four of you Laddy Jim Dick and Thorne will take Mercedes and my best white horses and with Yaqui as guide circle round through Altar Valley to the trail and head for YumaWait now Laddy
Let me finish
I want you to take the white horses for two reasonsto save them and to save you
Savvy
If Rojas should follow on my horses hed be likely to catch you
Also you can pack a great deal more than on the bronchs
Also the big horses can travel faster and farther on little grass and water
I want you to take the Indian because in a case of this kind hell be a godsend
If you get headed or lost or have to circle off the trail think what it d mean to have Yaqui with you
He knows Sonora as no Greaser knows it
He could hide you find water and grass when you would absolutely believe it impossible
The Indian is loyal
He has his debt to pay and hell pay it dont mistake me
When youre gone Ill hide Nell so Rojas wont see her if he searches the place
Then I think I could sit down and wait without any particular worry
The rangers approved of Beldings plan and Thorne choked in his effort to express his gratitude
All right well chance it concluded Belding
Ill go out now and call Rojas and his outfit overSay it might be as well for me to know just what he said in that paper
Thorne went to the side of his wife
Mercedes weve planned to outwit Rojas
Will you tell us just what he wrote
The girl sat up her eyes dilating and with her hands clasping Thornes
She said Rojas sworeby his saints and his virginthat if I wasnt givento himin twentyfour hourshe would set fire to the villagekill the mencarry off the womenhang the children on cactus thorns
A moments silence followed her last halting whisper
By his saints an his virgin
echoed Ladd
He laugheda cold cutting deadly laughsignificant and terrible
Then the Yaqui uttered a singular cry
Gale had heard this once before and now he remembered it was at the Papago Well
Look at the Indian whispered Belding hoarsely
Damn if I dont believe he understood every word Mercedes said
And gentlemen dont mistake me if he ever gets near Senor Rojas therell be some gory Aztec knife work
Yaqui had moved close to Mercedes and stood beside her as she leaned against her husband
She seemed impelled to meet the Indians gaze and evidently it was so powerful or hypnotic that it wrought irresistibly upon her
But she must have seen or divined what was beyond the others for she offered him her trembling hand
Yaqui took it and laid it against his body in a strange motion and bowed his head
Then he stepped back into the shadow of the room
Belding went outdoors while the rangers took up their former position at the west window
Each had his own somber thoughts Gale imagined and knew his own were dark enough
A slow fire crept along his veins
He saw Belding halt at the corrals and wave his hand
Then the rebels mounted and came briskly up the road this time to rein in abreast
Wherever Rojas had kept himself upon the former advance was not clear but he certainly was prominently in sight now
He made a gaudy almost a dashing figure
Gale did not recognize the white sombrero the crimson scarf the velvet jacket nor any feature of the dandys costume but their general effect the whole ensemble recalled vividly to mind his first sight of the bandit
Rojas dismounted and seemed to be listening
He betrayed none of the excitement Gale had seen in him that night at the Del Sol
Evidently this composure struck Ladd and Lash as unusual in a Mexican supposed to be laboring under stress of feeling
Belding made gestures vehemently bobbed his big head appeared to talk with his body as much as with his tongue
Then Rojas was seen to reply and after that it was clear that the talk became painful and difficult
It ended finally in what appeared to be mutual understanding
Rojas mounted and rode away with his men while Belding came tramping back to the house
As he entered the door his eyes were shining his big hands were clenched and he was breathing audibly
You can rope me if Im not locoed
he burst out
I went out to conciliate a redhanded little murderer and damn me if I didnt meet aawell Ive not suitable name handy
I started my bluff and got along pretty well but I forgot to mention that Mercedes was Thornes wife
And what do you think
Rojas swore he loved Mercedes swore hed marry her right here in Forlorn Riverswore he would give up robbing and killing people and take her away from Mexico
He has goldjewels
He swore if he didnt get her nothing mattered
Hed die anyway without herAnd heres the strange thing
I believe him
He was cold as ice and all hell inside
Never saw a Greaser like him
Well I pretended to be greatly impressed
We got to talking friendly I suppose though I didnt understand half he said and I imagine he gathered less what I said
Anyway without my asking he said for me to think it over for a day and then wed talk again
Shore were born lucky
ejaculated Ladd
I reckon Rojasll be smart enough to string his outfit across the few trails leadin out of Forlorn River remarked Jim
That neednt worry us
All we want is dark to come replied Belding
Yaqui will slip through
If we thank any lucky stars let it be for the IndianNow boys put on your thinking caps
Youll take eight horses the pick of my bunch
You must pack all thats needed for a possible long trip
Mind Yaqui may lead you down into some wild Sonora valley and give Rojas the slip
You may get to Yuma in six days and maybe in six weeks
Yet youve got to pack lighta small pack in saddleslarger ones on the two free horses
You may have a big fight
Laddy take the 405
Dick will pack his Remington
All of you go gunned heavy
But the main thing is a pack that ll be light enough for swift travel yet one that ll keep you from starving on the desert
The rest of that day passed swiftly
Dick had scarcely a word with Nell and all the time as he chose and deliberated and worked over his little pack there was a dull pain in his heart
The sun set twilight fell then night closed down fortunately a night slightly overcast
Gale saw the white horses pass his door like silent ghosts
Even Blanco Diablo made no sound and that fact was indeed a tribute to the Yaqui
Gale went out to put his saddle on Blanco Sol
The horse rubbed a soft nose against his shoulder
Then Gale returned to the sittingroom
There was nothing more to do but wait and say goodby
Mercedes came clad in leather chaps and coat a slim stripling of a cowboy her dark eyes flashing
Her beauty could not be hidden and now hope and courage had fired her blood
Gale drew Nell off into the shadow of the room
She was trembling and as she leaned toward him she was very different from the coy girl who had so long held him aloof
He took her into his arms
Dearest Im goingsonnAnd maybe Ill never Dick dodont say it sobbed Nell with her head on his breast
I might never come back he went on steadily
I love youIve loved you ever since the first moment I saw you
Do you care for mea little
Dear Dickdedear Dick my heart is breaking faltered Nell as she clung to him
It might be breaking for Mercedesfor Laddy and Jim
I want to hear something for myself
Something to have on long marchesround lonely campfires
Something to keep my spirit alive
Oh Nell you cant imagine that silence out therethat terrible world of sand and stoneDo you love me
Yes yes
Oh I love you so
I never knew it till now
I love you so
Dick Ill be safe and Ill waitand hope and pray for your return
If I come backnowhen I come back will you marry me
IIoh yes
she whispered and returned his kiss
Belding was in the room speaking softly
Nell darling I must go said Dick
Im a selfish little coward cried Nell
Its so splendid of you all
I ought to glory in it but I cant
Fight if you must Dick
Fight for that lovely persecuted girl
Ill love youthe moreOh
Goodby
Goodby
With a wrench that shook him Gale let her go
He heard Beldings soft voice
Yaqui says the early hours best
Trust him Laddy
Remember what I sayYaquis a godsend
Then they were all outside in the pale gloom under the trees
Yaqui mounted Blanco Diablo Mercedes was lifted upon White Woman Thorne climbed astride Queen Jim Lash was already upon his horse which was as white as the others but bore no name Ladd mounted the stallion Blanco Torres and gathered up the long halters of the two pack horses Gale came last with Blanco Sol
As he toed the stirrup hand on mane and pommel Gale took one more look in at the door
Nell stood in the gleam of light her hair shining face like ashes her eyes dark her lips parted her arms outstretched
That sweet and tragic picture etched its cruel outlines into Gales heart
He waved his hand and then fiercely leaped into the saddle
Blanco Sol stepped out
Before Gale stretched a line of moving horses white against dark shadows
He could not see the head of that column he scarcely heard a soft hoofbeat
A single star shone out of a rift in thin clouds
There was no wind
The air was cold
The dark space of desert seemed to yawn
To the left across the river flickered a few campfires
The chill night silent and mystical seemed to close in upon Gale and he faced the wide quivering black level with keen eyes and grim intent and an awakening of that wild rapture which came like a spell to him in the open desert
XI Across Cactus and Lava Blanco Sol showed no inclination to bend his head to the alfalfa which swished softly about his legs
Gale felt the horses sensitive almost human alertness
Sol knew as well as his master the nature of that flight
At the far corner of the field Yaqui halted and slowly the line of white horses merged into a compact mass
There was a trail here leading down to the river
the campfires were so close that the bright blazes could be seen in movement and dark forms crossed in front of them
Yaqui slipped out of his saddle
He ran his hand over Diablos nose and spoke low and repeated this action for each of the other horses
Gale had long ceased to question the strange Indians behavior
There was no explaining or understanding many of his manoeuvers
But the results of them were always thoughtprovoking
Gale had never seen horse stand so silently as in this instance no stampno champ of bitno toss of headno shake of saddle or packno heave or snort
It seemed they had become imbued with the spirit of the Indian
Yaqui moved away into the shadows as noiselessly as if he were one of them
The darkness swallowed him
He had taken a parallel with the trail
Gale wondered if Yaqui meant to try to lead his string of horses by the rebel sentinels
Ladd had his head bent low his ear toward the trail
Jims long neck had the arch of a listening deer
Gale listened too and as the slow silent moments went by his faculty of hearing grew more acute from strain
He heard Blanco Sol breathe he heard the pound of his own heart he heard the silken rustle of the alfalfa he heard a faint faroff sound of voice like a lost echo
Then his ear seemed to register a movement of air a disturbance so soft as to be nameless
Then followed long silent moments
Yaqui appeared as he had vanished
He might have been part of the shadows
But he was there
He started off down the trail leading Diablo
Again the white line stretched slowly out
Gale fell in behind
A bench of ground covered with sparse greasewood sloped gently down to the deep wide arroyo of Forlorn River
Blanco Sol shied a few feet out of the trail
Peering low with keen eyes Gale made out three objectsa white sombrero a blanket and a Mexican lying face down
The Yaqui had stolen upon this sentinel like a silent wind of death
Just then a desert coyote wailed and the wild cry fitted the darkness and the Yaquis deed
Once under the dark lee of the river bank Yaqui caused another halt and he disappeared as before
It seemed to Gale that the Indian started to cross the pale level sandbed of the river where stones stood out gray and the darker line of opposite shore was visible
But he vanished and it was impossible to tell whether he went one way or another
Moments passed
The horses held heads up looked toward the glimmering campfires and listened
Gale thrilled with the meaning of it allthe nightthe silence the flightand the wonderful Indian stealing with the slow inevitableness of doom upon another sentinel
An hour passed and Gale seemed to have become deadened to all sense of hearing
There were no more sounds in the world
The desert was as silent as it was black
Yet again came that strange change in the tensity of Gales earstrain a check a break a vibrationand this time the sound did not go nameless
It might have been moan of wind or wail of fardistant wolf but Gale imagined it was the strangling deathcry of another guard or that strange involuntary utterance of the Yaqui
Blanco Sol trembled in all his great frame and then Gale was certain the sound was not imagination
That certainty once for all fixed in Gales mind the mood of his flight
The Yaqui dominated the horses and the rangers
Thorne and Mercedes were as persons under a spell
The Indians strange silence the feeling of mystery and power he seemed to create all that was incomprehensible about him were emphasized in the light of his slow sure and ruthless action
If he dominated the others surely he did more for Galecolored his thoughtspresage the wild and terrible future of that flight
If Rojas embodied all the hatred and passion of the peonscourged slave for a thousand yearsthen Yaqui embodied all the darkness the cruelty the white sunheated blood the ferocity the tragedy of the desert
Suddenly the Indian stalked out of the gloom
He mounted Diablo and headed across the river
Once more the line of moving white shadows stretched out
The soft sand gave forth no sound at all
The glimmering campfires sank behind the western bank
Yaqui led the way into the willows and there was faint swishing of leaves then into the mesquite and there was faint rustling of branches
The glimmering lights appeared again and grotesque forms of saguaros loomed darkly
Gale peered sharply along the trail and presently on the pale sand under a cactus there lay a blanketed form prone outstretched a carbine clutched in one hand a cigarette still burning in the other
The cavalcade of white horses passed within five hundred yards of campfires around which dark forms moved in plain sight
Soft pads in sand faint metallic tickings of steel on thorns low regular breathing of horsesthese were all the sounds the fugitives made and they could not have been heard at onefifth the distance
The lights disappeared from time to time grew dimmer more flickering and at last they vanished altogether
Beldings fleet and tireless steeds were out in front the desert opened ahead wide dark vast
Rojas and his rebels were behind eating drinking careless
The somber shadow lifted from Gales heart
He held now an unquenchable faith in the Yaqui
Belding would be listening back there along the river
He would know of the escape
He would tell Nell and then hide her safely
As Gale accepted a strange and fatalistic foreshadowing of toil blood and agony in this desert journey so he believed in Mercedess ultimate freedom and happiness and his own return to the girl who had grown dearer than life
A cold gray dawn was fleeing before a rosy sun when Yaqui halted the march at Papago Well
The horses were taken to water then led down the arroyo into the grass
Here packs were slipped saddles removed
Mercedes was cold lame tired but happy
It warmed Gales blood to look at her
The shadow of fear still lay in her eyes but it was passing
Hope and courage shone there and affection for her ranger protectors and the Yaqui and unutterable love for the cavalryman
Jim Lash remarked how cleverly they had fooled the rebels
Shore theyll be comin along replied Ladd
They built a fire cooked and ate
The Yaqui spoke only one word Sleep
Blankets were spread
Mercedes dropped into a deep slumber her head on Thornes shoulder
Excitement kept Throne awake
The two rangers dozed beside the fire
Gale shared the Yaquis watch
The sun began to climb and the icy edge of dawn to wear away
Rabbits bobbed their cotton tails under the mesquite
Gale climbed a rocky wall above the arroyo bank and there with command over the miles of the backtrail he watched
It was a sweeping rolling wrinkled and streaked range of desert that he saw ruddy in the morning sunlight with patches of cactus and mesquite roughetched in shimmering gloom
No Name Mountains split the eastern sky towering high gloomy grand with purple veils upon their slopes
They were forty miles away and looked five
Gale thought of the girl who was there under their shadow
Yaqui kept the horses bunched and he led them from one little park of galleta grass to another
At the end of three hours he took them to water
Upon his return Gale clambered down from his outlook the rangers grew active
Mercedes was awakened and soon the party faced westward their long shadows moving before them
Yaqui led with Blanco Diablo in a long easy lope
The arroyo washed itself out into flat desert and the greens began to shade into gray and then the gray into red
Only sparse cactus and weathered ledges dotted the great low roll of a rising escarpment
Yaqui suited the gait of his horse to the lay of the land and his followers accepted his pace
There were canter and trot and swift walk and slow climb and long swingmiles up and down and forward
The sun soared hot
The heated air lifted and incoming currents from the west swept low and hard over the barren earth
In the distance all around the horizon accumulations of dust seemed like ranging mushrooming yellow clouds
Yaqui was the only one of the fugitives who never looked back
Mercedes did it the most
Gale felt what compelled her he could not resist it himself
But it was a vain search
For a thousand puffs of white and yellow dust rose from that backward sweep of desert and any one of them might have been blown from under horses hoofs
Gale had a conviction that when Yaqui gazed back toward the well and the shining plain beyond there would be reason for it
But when the sun lost its heat and the wind died down Yaqui took long and careful surveys westward from the high points on the trail
Sunset was not far off and there in a bare spotted valley lay Coyote Tanks the only waterhole between Papago Well and the Sonoyta Oasis
Gale used his glass told Yaqui there was no smoke no sign of life still the Indian fixed his falcon eyes on distant spots looked long
It was as if his vision could not detect what reason or cunning or intuition perhaps an instinct told him was there
Presently in a sheltered spot where blown sand had not obliterated the trail Yaqui found the tracks of horses
The curve of the iron shoes pointed westward
An intersecting trail from the north came in here
Gale thought the tracks either one or two days old
Ladd said they were one day
The Indian shook his head
No farther advance was undertaken
The Yaqui headed south and traveled slowly climbing to the brow of a bold height of weathered mesa
There he sat his horse and waited
No one questioned him
The rangers dismounted to stretch their legs and Mercedes was lifted to a rock where she rested
Thorne had gradually yielded to the deserts influence for silence
He spoke once or twice to Gale and occasionally whispered to Mercedes
Gale fancied his friend would soon learn that necessary speech in desert travel meant a few greetings a few words to make real the fact of human companionship a few short terse terms for the business of day or night and perhaps a stern order or a soft call to a horse
The sun went down and the golden rosy veils turned to blue and shaded darker till twilight was there in the valley
Only the spurs of mountains spiring the near and far horizon retained their clear outline
Darkness approached and the clear peaks faded
The horses stamped to be on the move
Malo
exclaimed the Yaqui
He did not point with arm but his falcon head was outstretched and his piercing eyes gazed at the blurring spot which marked the location of Coyote Tanks
Jim can you see anything
asked Ladd
Nope but I reckon he can
Darkness increased momentarily till night shaded the deepest part of the valley
Then Ladd suddenly straightened up turned to his horse and muttered low under his breath
I reckon so said Lash and for once his easy goodnatured tone was not in evidence
His voice was harsh
Gales eyes keen as they were were last of the rangers to see tiny needlepoints of light just faintly perceptible in the blackness
Laddy
Campfires
he asked quickly
Shores youre born my boy
How many
Ladd did not reply but Yaqui held up his hand his fingers wide
Five campfires
A strong force of rebels or raiders or some other desert troop was camping at Coyote Tanks
Yaqui sat his horse for a moment motionless as stone his dark face immutable and impassive
Then he stretched wide his right arm in the direction of No Name Mountains now losing their last faint traces of the afterglow and he shook his head
He made the same impressive gesture toward the Sonoyta Oasis with the same somber negation
Thereupon he turned Diablos head to the south and started down the slope
His manner had been decisive even stern
Lash did not question it nor did Ladd
Both rangers hesitated however and showed a strange almost sullen reluctance which Gale had never seen in them before
Raiders were one thing Rojas was another Camino del Diablo still another but that vast and desolate and unwatered waste of cactus and lava the Sonora Desert might appal the stoutest heart
Gale felt his own sinkfelt himself flinch
Oh where is he going
cried Mercedes
Her poignant voice seemed to break a spell
Shore lady Yaquis goin home replied Ladd gently
An considerin our troubles I reckon we ought to thank God he knows the way
They mounted and rode down the slope toward the darkening south
Not until night travel was obstructed by a wall of cactus did the Indian halt to make a dry camp
Water and grass for the horses and fire to cook by were not to be had
Mercedes bore up surprisingly but she fell asleep almost the instant her thirst had been allayed
Thorne laid her upon a blanket and covered her
The men ate and drank
Diablo was the only horse that showed impatience but he was angry and not in distress
Blanco Sol licked Gales hand and stood patiently
Many a time had he taken his rest at night without a drink
Yaqui again bade the men sleep
Ladd said he would take the early watch but from the way the Indian shook his head and settled himself against a stone it appeared if Ladd remained awake he would have company
Gale lay down weary of limb and eye
He heard the soft thump of hoofs the sough of wind in the cactusthen no more
When he awoke there was bustle and stir about him
Day had not yet dawned and the air was freezing cold
Yaqui had found a scant bundle of greasewood which served to warm them and to cook breakfast
Mercedes was not aroused till the last moment
Day dawned with the fugitives in the saddle
A picketed wall of cactus hedged them in yet the Yaqui made a tortuous path that zigzag as it might in the main always headed south
It was wonderful how he slipped Diablo through the narrow aisles of thorns saving the horse and saving himself
The others were torn and clutched and held and stung
The way was a flat sandy pass between low mountain ranges
There were open spots and aisles and squares of sand and hedging rows of prickly pear and the huge spiderlegged ocatillo and hummocky masses of clustered bisnagi
The day grew dry and hot
A fragrant wind blew through the pass
Cactus flowers bloomed red and yellow and magenta
The sweet pale Ajo lily gleamed in shady corners
Ten miles of travel covered the length of the pass
It opened wide upon a wonderful scene an arboreal desert dominated by its pure light green yet lined by many merging colors
And it rose slowly to a low dim and darkred zone of lava spurred peaked domed by volcano cones a wild and ragged region illimitable as the horizon
The Yaqui if not at fault was yet uncertain
His falcon eyes searched and roved and became fixed at length at the southwest and toward this he turned his horse
The great fluted saguaros fifty sixty feet high raised columnal forms and their branching limbs and curving lines added a grace to the desert
It was the lowbushed cactus that made the toil and pain of travel
Yet these thorny forms were beautiful
In the basins between the ridges to right and left along the floor of low plains the mirage glistened wavered faded vanishedlakes and trees and clouds
Inverted mountains hung suspended in the lilac air and faint tracery of whitewalled cities
At noon Yaqui halted the cavalcade
He had selected a field of bisnagi cactus for the place of rest
Presently his reason became obvious
With long heavy knife he cut off the tops of these barrelshaped plants
He scooped out soft pulp and with stone and hand then began to pound the deeper pulp into a juicy mass
When he threw this out there was a little water left sweet cool water which man and horse shared eagerly
Thus he made even the deserts fiercest growths minister to their needs
But he did not halt long
Miles of graygreen spiked walls lay between him and that line of ragged red lava which manifestly he must reach before dark
The travel became faster straighter
And the glistening thorns clutched and clung to leather and cloth and flesh
The horses reared snorted balked leapedbut they were sent on
Only Blanco Sol the patient the plodding the indomitable needed no goad or spur
Waves and scarfs and wreaths of heat smoked up from the sand
Mercedes reeled in her saddle
Thorne bade her drink bathed her face supported her and then gave way to Ladd who took the girl with him on Torres broad back
Yaquis unflagging purpose and iron arm were bitter and hateful to the proud and haughty spirit of Blanco Diablo
For once Beldings great white devil had met his master
He fought rider bit bridle cactus sandand yet he went on and on zigzagging turning winding crashing through the barbed growths
The middle of the afternoon saw Thorne reeling in his saddle and then wherever possible Gales powerful arm lent him strength to hold his seat
The giant cactus came to be only so in name
These saguaros were thinning out growing stunted and most of them were single columns
Gradually other cactus forms showed a harder struggle for existence and the spaces of sand between were wider
But now the dreaded glistening choya began to show pale and gray and white upon the rising slope
Roundtopped hills sunsetcolored above blueblack below intervened to hide the distant spurs and peaks
Mile and mile long tongues of red lava streamed out between the hills and wound down to stop abruptly upon the slope
The fugitives were entering a desolate burnedout world
It rose above them in limitless gradual ascent and spread wide to east and west
Then the waste of sand began to yield to cinders
The horses sank to their fetlocks as they toiled on
A fine choking dust blew back from the leaders and men coughed and horses snorted
The huge round hills rose smooth symmetrical colored as if the setting sun was shining on bare blueblack surfaces
But the sun was now behind the hills
In between ran the streams of lava
The horsemen skirted the edge between slope of hill and perpendicular ragged wall
This red lava seemed to have flowed and hardened there only yesterday
It was broken sharp dull rust color full of cracks and caves and crevices and everywhere upon its jagged surface gew the whitethorned choya
Again twilight encompassed the travelers
But there was still light enough for Gale to see the constricted passage open into a wide deep space where the dull color was relieved by the gray of gnarled and dwarfed mesquite
Blanco Sol keenest of scent whistled his welcome herald of water
The other horses answered quickened their gait
Gale smelled it too sweet cool damp on the dry air
Yaqui turned the corner of a pocket in the lava wall
The file of white horses rounded the corner after him
And Gale coming last saw the pale glancing gleam of a pool of water beautiful in the twilight
Next day the Yaquis relentless driving demand on the horses was no longer in evidence
He lost no time but he did not hasten
His course wound between low cinder dunes which limited their view of the surrounding country
These dunes finally sank down to a black floor as hard as flint with tongues of lava to the left and to the right the slow descent into the cactus plain
Yaqui was now traveling due west
It was Gales idea that the Indian was skirting the first sharptoothed slope of a vast volcanic plateau which formed the western half of the Sonora Desert and extended to the Gulf of California
Travel was slow but not exhausting for rider or beast
A little sand and meager grass gave a grayish tinge to the strip of black ground between lava and plain
That day as the manner rather than the purpose of the Yaqui changed so there seemed to be subtle differences in the others of the party
Gale himself lost a certain sickening dread which had not been for himself but for Mercedes and Nell and Thorne and the rangers
Jim goodnatured again might have been patrolling the boundary line
Ladd lost his taciturnity and his gloom changed to a cool careless air
A mood that was almost defiance began to be manifested in Thorne
It was in Mercedes however that Gale marked the most significant change
Her collapse the preceding day might never have been
She was lame and sore she rode her saddle sidewise and often she had to be rested and helped but she had found a reserve fund of strength and her mental condition was not the same that it had been
Her burden of fear had been lifted
Gale saw in her the difference he always felt in himself after a few days in the desert
Already Mercedes and he and all of them had begun to respond to the desert spirit
Moreover Yaquis strange influence must have been a call to the primitive
Thirty miles of easy stages brought the fugitives to another waterhold a little round pocket under the heavedup edge of lava
There was spare short bleached grass for the horses but no wood for a fire
This night there was question and reply conjecture doubt opinion and conviction expressed by the men of the party
But the Indian who alone could have told where they were where they were going what chance they had to escape maintained his stoical silence
Gale took the early watch Ladd the midnight one and Lash that of the morning
They day broke rosy glorious cold as ice
Action was necessary to make useful benumbed hands and feet
Mercedes was fed while yet wrapped in blankets
Then while the packs were being put on and horses saddled she walked up and down slapping her hands warming her ears
The rose color of the dawn was in her cheeks and the wonderful clearness of desert light in her eyes
Thornes eyes sought her constantly
The rangers watched her
The Yaqui bent his glance upon her only seldom but when he did look it seemed that his strange fixed and inscrutable face was about to break into a smile
Yet that never happened
Gale himself was surprised to find how often his own glance found the slender dark beautiful Spaniard
Was this because of her beauty
he wondered
He thought not altogether
Mercedes was a woman
She represented something in life that men of all races for thousands of years had loved to see and own to revere and debase to fight and die for
It was a significant index to the days travel that Yaqui should keep a blanket from the pack and tear it into strips to bind the legs of the horses
It meant the dreaded choya and the knifeedged lava
That Yaqui did not mount Diablo was still more significant
Mercedes must ride but the others must walk
The Indian led off into one of the gray notches between the tumbled streams of lava
These streams were about thirty feet high a rotting mass of splintered lava rougher than any other kind of roughness in the world
At the apex of the notch where two streams met a narrow gully wound and ascended
Gale caught sight of the dim pale shadow of a onetime trail
Near at hand it was invisible he had to look far ahead to catch the faint tracery
Yaqui led Diablo into it and then began the most laborious and vexatious and painful of all slow travel
Once up on top of that lava bed Gale saw stretching away breaking into millions of crests and ruts a vast redblack field sweeping onward and upward with ragged low ridges and mounds and spurs leading higher and higher to a great split escarpment wall above which dim peaks shone hazily blue in the distance
He looked no more in that direction
To keep his foothold to save his horse cost him all energy and attention
The course was marked out for him in the tracks of the other horses
He had only to follow
But nothing could have been more difficult
The disintegrating surface of a lava bed was at once the roughest the hardest the meanest the cruelest the most deceitful kind of ground to travel
It was rotten yet it had corners as hard and sharp as pikes
It was rough yet as slippery as ice
If there was a foot of level surface that space would be one to break through under a horses hoofs
It was seamed lined cracked ridged knotted iron
This lava bed resembled a tremendously magnified clinker
It had been a running sea of molten flint boiling bubbling spouting and it had burst its surface into a million sharp facets as it hardened
The color was dull dark angry red like no other red inflaming to the eye
The millions of minute crevices were dominated by deep fissures and holes ragged and rough beyond all comparison
The fugitives made slow progress
They picked a cautious winding way to and fro in little steps here and there along the many twists of the trail up and down the unavoidable depressions round and round the holes
At noon so winding back upon itself had been their course they appeared to have come only a short distance up the lava slope
It was rough work for them it was terrible work for the horses
Blanco Diablo refused to answer to the power of the Yaqui
He balked he plunged he bit and kicked
He had to be pulled and beaten over many places
Mercedess horse almost threw her and she was put upon Blanco Sol
The white charger snorted a protest then obedient to Gales stern call patiently lowered his noble head and pawed the lava for a footing that would hold
The lava caused Gale toil and worry and pain but he hated the choyas
As the travel progressed this species of cactus increased in number of plants and in size
Everywhere the red lava was spotted with little round patches of glistening frosty white
And under every bunch of choya along and in the trail were the discarded joints like little frosty pine cones covered with spines
It was utterly impossible always to be on the lookout for these and when Gale stepped on one often as not the steellike thorns pierced leather and flesh
Gale came almost to believe what he had heard claimed by desert travelersthat the choya was alive and leaped at man or beast
Certain it was when Gale passed one if he did not put all attention to avoiding it he was hooked through his chaps and held by barbed thorns
The pain was almost unendurable
It was like no other
It burned stung beatalmost seemed to freeze
It made useless arm or leg
It made him bite his tongue to keep from crying out
It made the sweat roll off him
It made him sick
Moreover bad as the choya was for man it was infinitely worse for beast
A jagged stab from this poisoned cactus was the only thing Blanco Sol could not stand
Many times that day before he carried Mercedes he had wildly snorted and then stood trembling while Gale picked broken thorns from the muscular legs
But after Mercedes had been put upon Sol Gale made sure no choya touched him
The afternoon passed like the morning in ceaseless winding and twisting and climbing along this abandoned trail
Gale saw many waterholes mostly dry some containing water all of them catchbasins full only after rainy season
Little ugly bunched bushes that Gale scarcely recognized as mesquites grew near these holes also stunted greasewood and prickly pear
There was no grass and the choya alone flourished in that hard soil
Darkness overtook the party as they unpacked beside a pool of water deep under an overhanging shelf of lava
It had been a hard day
The horses drank their fill and then stood patiently with drooping heads
Hunger and thirst appeased and a warm fire cheered the weary and footsore fugitives
Yaqui said Sleep
And so another night passed
Upon the following morning ten miles or more up the slowascending lava slope Gales attention was called from his somber search for the less rough places in the trail
Dick why does Yaqui look back
asked Mercedes
Gale was startled
Does he
Every little while replied Mercedes
Gale was in the rear of all the other horses so as to take for Mercedess sake the advantage of the broken trail
Yaqui was leading Diablo winding around a break
His head was bent as he stepped slowly and unevenly upon the lava
Gale turned to look back the first time in several days
The mighty hollow of the desert below seemed wide strip of redwide strip of greenwide strip of graystreaking to purple peaks
It was all too vast too mighty to grasp any little details
He thought of course of Rojas in certain pursuit but it seemed absurded to look for him
Yaqui led on and Gale often glanced up from his task to watch the Indian
Presently he saw him stop turn and look back
Ladd did likewise and then Jim and Thorne
Gale found the desire irresistible
Thereafter he often rested Blanco Sol and looked back the while
He had his fieldglass but did not choose to use it
Rojas will follow said Mercedes
Gale regarded her in amaze
The tone of her voice had been indefinable
If there were fear then he failed to detect it
She was gazing back down the colored slope and something about her perhaps the steady falcon gaze of her magnificent eyes reminded him of Yaqui
Many times during the ensuing hour the Indian faced about and always his followers did likewise
It was high noon with the sun beating hot and the lava radiating heat when Yaqui halted for a rest
The place selected was a ridge of lava almost a promontory considering its outlook
The horses bunched here and drooped their heads
The rangers were about to slip the packs and remove saddles when Yaqui restrained them
He fixed a changeless gleaming gaze on the slow descent but did not seem to look afar
Suddenly he uttered his strange crythe one Gale considered involuntary or else significant of some tribal trait or feeling
It was incomprehensible but no one could have doubted its potency
Yaqui pointed down the lava slope pointed with finger and arm and neck and headhis whole body was instinct with direction
His whole being seemed to have been animated and then frozen
His posture could not have been misunderstood yet his expression had not altered
Gale had never seen the Indians face change its hard redbronze calm
It was the color and the flintiness and the character of the lava at his feet
Shore he sees somethin said Ladd
But my eyes are not good
I reckon I aint sure of mine replied Jim
Im bothered by a dim movin streak down there
Thorne gazed eagerly down as he stood beside Mercedes who sat motionless facing the slope
Gale looked and looked till he hurt his eyes
Then he took his glass out of its case on Sols saddle
There appeared to be nothing upon the lava but the innumerable dots of choya shining in the sun
Gale swept his glass slowly forward and back
Then into a nearer field of vision crept a long whiteandblack line of horses and men
Without a word he handed the glass to Ladd
The ranger used it muttering to himself
Theyre on the lava fifteen miles down in an air line he said presently
Jim shore theyre twice that an more accordin to the trail
Jim had his look and replied I reckon were a day an a night in the lead
Is it Rojas
burst out Thorne with set jaw
Yes Thorne
Its Rojas and a dozen men or more replied Gale and he looked up at Mercedes
She was transformed
She might have been a medieval princess embodying all the Spanish power and passion of that time breathing revenge hate unquenchable spirit of fire
If her beauty had been wonderful in her helpless and appealing moments now when she looked back whitefaced and flameeyed it was transcendant
Gale drew a long deep breath
The mood which had presaged pursuit strife blood on this somber desert returned to him tenfold
He saw Thornes face corded by black veins and his teeth exposed like those of a snarling wolf
These rangers who had coolly risked death many times and had dealt it often were white as no fear or pain could have made them
Then on the moment Yaqui raised his hand not clenched or doubled tight but curled rigid like an eagles claw and he shook it in a strange slow gesture which was menacing and terrible
It was the woman that called to the depths of these men
And their passion to kill and to save was surpassed only by the wild hate which was yet love the unfathomable emotion of a peon slave
Gale marveled at it while he felt his whole being cold and tense as he turned once more to follow in the tracks of his leaders
The fight predicted by Belding was at hand
What a fight that must be
Rojas was traveling light and fast
He was gaining
He had bought his men with gold with extravagant promises perhaps with offers of the body and blood of an aristocrat hateful to their kind
Lastly there was the wild desolate environment a tortured wilderness of jagged lava and poisoned choya a lonely fierce and repellant world a red stage most somberly and fittingly colored for a supreme struggle between men
Yaqui looked back no more
Mercedes looked back no more
But the others looked and the time came when Gale saw the creeping line of pursuers with naked eyes
A level line above marked the rim of the plateau
Sand began to show in the little lava pits
On and upward toiled the cavalcade still very slowly advancing
At last Yaqui reached the rim
He stood with his hand on Blanco Diablo and both were silhouetted against the sky
That was the outlook for a Yaqui
And his great horse dazzlingly white in the sunlight with head wildly and proudly erect mane and tail flying in the wind made a magnificent picture
The others toiled on and upward and at last Gale led Blanco Sol over the rim
Then all looked down the red slope
But shadows were gathering there and no moving line could be seen
Yaqui mounted and wheeled Diablo away
The others followed
Gale saw that the plateau was no more than a vast field of low ragged circles levels mounds cones and whirls of lava
The lava was of a darker red than that down upon the slope and it was harder than flint
In places fine sand and cinders covered the uneven floor
Strange varieties of cactus vied with the omnipresent choya
Yaqui however found ground that his horse covered at a swift walk
But there was only an hour perhaps of this comparatively easy going
Then the Yaqui led them into a zone of craters
The top of the earth seemed to have been blown out in holes from a few rods in width to large craters some shallow others deep and all red as fire
Yaqui circled close to abysses which yawned sheer from a level surface and he appeared always to be turning upon his course to avoid them
The plateau had now a considerable dip to the west
Gale marked the slow heave and ripple of the ocean of lava to the south where high rounded peaks marked the center of this volcanic region
The uneven nature of the slope westward prevented any extended view until suddenly the fugitives emerged from a rugged break to come upon a sublime and aweinspiring spectacle
They were upon a high point of the western slope of the plateau
It was a slope but so many leagues long in its descent that only from a height could any slant have been perceptible
Yaqui and his white horse stood upon the brink of a crater miles in circumference a thousand feet deep with its red walls patched in frostcolored spots by the silvery choya
The giant tracery of lava streams waved down the slope to disappear in undulating sand dunes
And these bordered a seemingly endless arm of blue sea
This was the Gulf of California
Beyond the Gulf rose dim bold mountains and above them hung the setting sun dusky red flooding all that barren empire with a sinister light
It was strange to Gale then and perhaps to the others to see their guide lead Diablo into a smooth and wellworn trail along the rim of the awful crater
Gale looked down into that red chasm
It resembled an inferno
The dark cliffs upon the opposite side were veiled in blue haze that seemed like smoke
Here Yaqui was at home
He moved and looked about him as a man coming at last into his own
Gale saw him stop and gaze out over that redribbed void to the Gulf
Gale devined that somewhere along this crater of hell the Yaqui would make his final stand and one look into his strange inscrutable eyes made imagination picture a fitting doom for the pursuing Rojas
XII The Crater of Hell The trail led along a gigantic fissure in the side of the crater and then down and down into a redwalled blue hazed labyrinth
Presently Gale upon turning a sharp corner was utterly amazed to see that the split in the lava sloped out and widened into an arroyo
It was so green and soft and beautiful in all the angry contorted red surrounding that Gale could scarcely credit his sight
Blanco Sol whistled his welcome to the scent of water
Then Gale saw a great hole a pit in the shiny lava a dark cool shady well
There was evidence of the fact that at flood seasons the water had an outlet into the arroyo
The soil appeared to be a fine sand in which a reddish tinge predominated and it was abundantly covered with a long grass still partly green
Mesquites and palo verdes dotted the arroyo and gradually closed in thickets that obstructed the view
Shore it all beats me exclaimed Ladd
What a place to holeup in
We could have hid here for a long time
Boys I saw mountain sheep the real old genuine Rocky Mountain bighorn
What do you think of that
I reckon its a Yaqui huntingground replied Lash
That trail we hit must be hundreds of years old
Its worn deep and smooth in iron lava
Well all I got to say isBeldin was shore right about the Indian
An I can see Rojass finish somewhere up along that awful hellhole
Camp was made on a level spot
Yaqui took the horses to water and then turned them loose in the arroyo
It was a tired and somber group that sat down to eat
The strain of suspense equaled the wearing effects of the long ride
Mercedes was calm but her great dark eyes burned in her white face
Yaqui watched her
The others looked at her with unspoken pride
Presently Thorne wrapped her in his blankets and she seemed to fall asleep at once
Twilight deepened
The campfire blazed brighter
A cool wind played with Mercedess black hair waving strands across her brow
Little of Yaquis purpose or plan could be elicited from him
But the look of him was enough to satisfy even Thorne
He leaned against a pile of wood which he had collected and his gloomy gaze pierced the campfire and at long intervals strayed over the motionless form of the Spanish girl
The rangers and Thorne however talked in low tones
It was absolutely impossible for Rojas and his men to reach the waterhole before noon of the next day
And long before that time the fugitives would have decided on a plan of defense
What that defense would be and where it would be made were matters over which the men considered gravely
Ladd averred the Yaqui would put them into an impregnable position that at the same time would prove a deathtrap for their pursuers
They exhausted every possibility and then tired as they were still kept on talking
What stuns me is that Rojas stuck to our trail said Thorne his lined and haggard face expressive of dark passion
He has followed us into this fearful desert
Hell lose men horses perhaps his life
Hes only a bandit and he stands to win no gold
If he ever gets out of here it ll be by herculean labor and by terrible hardship
All for a poor little helpless womanjust a woman
My God I cant understand it
Shorejust a woman replied Ladd solemnly nodding his head
Then there was a long silence during which the men gazed into the fire
Each perhaps had some vague conception of the enormity of Rojass love or hatesome faint and amazing glimpse of the gulf of human passion
Those were cold hard grim faces upon which the light flickered
Sleep said the Yaqui
Thorne rolled in his blanket close beside Mercedes
Then one by one the rangers stretched out feet to the fire
Gale found that he could not sleep
His eyes were weary but they would not stay shut his body ached for rest yet he could not lie still
The night was so somber so gloomy and the lavaencompassed arroyo full of shadows
The dark velvet sky fretted with white fire seemed to be close
There was an absolute silence as of death
Nothing movednothing outside of Gales body appeared to live
The Yaqui sat like an image carved out of lava
The others lay prone and quiet
Would another night see any of them lie that way quiet forever
Gale felt a ripple pass over him that was at once a shudder and a contraction of muscles
Used as he was to the desert and its oppression why should he feel tonight as if the weight of its lava and the burden of its mystery were bearing him down
He sat up after a while and again watched the fire
Nells sweet face floated like a wraith in the pale smokeglowed and flushed and smiled in the embers
Other faces shone therehis sisters that of his mother
Gale shook off the tender memories
This desolate wilderness with its forbidding silence and its dark promise of hell on the morrowthis was not the place to unnerve oneself with thoughts of love and home
But the torturing paradox of the thing was that this was just the place and just the night for a man to be haunted
By and by Gale rose and walked down a shadowy aisle between the mesquites
On his way back the Yaqui joined him
Gale was not surprised
He had become used to the Indians strange guardianship
But now perhaps because of Gales poignancy of thought the contending tides of love and regret the deep burning premonition of deadly strife he was moved to keener scrutiny of the Yaqui
That of course was futile
The Indian was impenetrable silent strange
But suddenly inexplicably Gale felt Yaquis human quality
It was aloof as was everything about this Indian but it was there
This savage walked silently beside him without glance or touch or word
His thought was as inscrutable as if mind had never awakened in his race
Yet Gale was conscious of greatness and somehow he was reminded of the Indians story
His home had been desolated his people carried off to slavery his wife and children separated from him to die
What had life meant to the Yaqui
What had been in his heart
What was now in his mind
Gale could not answer these questions
But the difference between himself and Yaqui which he had vaguely felt as that between savage and civilized men faded out of his mind forever
Yaqui might have considered he owed Gale a debt and with a Yaquis austere and noble fidelity to honor he meant to pay it
Nevertheless this was not the thing Gale found in the Indians silent presence
Accepting the desert with its subtle and inconceivable influence Gale felt that the savage and the white man had been bound in a tie which was no less brotherly because it could not be comprehended
Toward dawn Gale managed to get some sleep
Then the morning broke with the sun hidden back of the uplift of the plateau
The horses trooped up the arroyo and snorted for water
After a hurried breakfast the packs were hidden in holes in the lava
The saddles were left where they were and the horses allowed to graze and wander at will
Canteens were filled a small bag of food was packed and blankets made into a bundle
Then Yaqui faced the steep ascent of the lava slope
The trail he followed led up on the right side of the fissure opposite to the one he had come down
It was a steep climb and encumbered as the men were they made but slow progress
Mercedes had to be lifted up smooth steps and across crevices
They passed places where the rims of the fissure were but a few yards apart
At length the rims widened out and the red smoky crater yawned beneath
Yaqui left the trail and began clambering down over the rough and twisted convolutions of lava which formed the rim
Sometimes he hung sheer over the precipice
It was with extreme difficulty that the party followed him
Mercedes had to be held on narrow footwide ledges
The choya was there to hinder passage
Finally the Indian halted upon a narrow bench of flat smooth lava and his followers worked with exceeding care and effort down to his position
At the back of this bench between bunches of choya was a niche a shallow cave with floor lined apparently with mold
Ladd said the place was a refuge which had been inhabited by mountain sheep for many years
Yaqui spread blankets inside left the canteen and the sack of food and with a gesture at once humble yet that of a chief he invited Mercedes to enter
A few more gestures and fewer words disclosed his plan
In this inaccessible nook Mercedes was to be hidden
The men were to go around upon the opposite rim and block the trail leading down to the waterhole
Gale marked the nature of this eyrie
It was the wildest and most rugged place he had ever stepped upon
Only a sheep could have climbed up the wall above or along the slanting shelf of lava beyond
Below glistened a whole bank of choya frosty in the sunlight and it overhung an apparently bottomless abyss
Ladd chose the smallest gun in the party and gave it to Mercedes
Shore its best to go the limit on bein ready he said simply
The chances are youll never need it
But if you do He left off there and his break was significant
Mercedes answered him with a fearless and indomitable flash of eyes
Thorne was the only one who showed any shaken nerve
His leavetaking of his wife was affecting and hurried
Then he and the rangers carefully stepped in the tracks of the Yaqui
They climbed up to the level of the rim and went along the edge
When they reached the fissure and came upon its narrowest point Yaqui showed in his actions that he meant to leap it
Ladd restrained the Indian
They then continued along the rim till they reached several bridges of lava which crossed it
The fissures was deep in some parts choked in others
Evidently the crater had no direct outlet into the arroyo below
Its bottom however must have been far beneath the level of the waterhole
After the fissure was crossed the trail was soon found
Here it ran back from the rim
Yaqui waved his hand to the right where along the corrugated slope of the crater there were holes and crevices and coverts for a hundred men
Yaqui strode on up the trail toward a higher point where presently his dark figure stood motionless against the sky
The rangers and Thorne selected a deep depression out of which led several ruts deep enough for cover
According to Ladd it was as good a place as any perhaps not so hidden as others but freer from the dreaded choya
Here the men laid down rifles and guns and removing their heavy cartridge belts settled down to wait
Their location was close to the rim wall and probably five hundred yards from the opposite rim which was now seen to be considerably below them
The glaring red cliff presented a deceitful and baffling appearance
It had a thousand ledges and holes in its surfaces and one moment it looked perpendicular and the next there seemed to be a long slant
Thorne pointed out where he thought Mercedes was hidden Ladd selected another place and Lash still another
Gale searched for the bank of choya he had seen under the bench where Mercedess retreat lay and when he found it the others disputed his opinion
Then Gale brought his field glass into requisition proving that he was right
Once located and fixed in sight the white patch of choya the bench and the sheep eyrie stood out from the other features of that rugged wall
But all the men were agreed that Yaqui had hidden Mercedes where only the eyes of a vulture could have found her
Jim Lash crawled into a little strip of shade and bided the time tranquilly
Ladd was restless and impatient and watchful every little while rising to look up the farreaching slope and then to the right where Yaquis dark figure stood out from a high point of the rim
Thorne grew silent and seemed consumed by a slow sullen rage
Gale was neither calm nor free of a gnawing suspense nor of a waiting wrath
But as best he could he put the pending action out of mind
It came over him all of a sudden that he had not grasped the stupendous nature of this desert setting
There was the measureless red slope its lower ridges finally sinking into white sand dunes toward the blue sea
The cold sparkling light the white sun the deep azure of sky the feeling of boundless expanse all around himthese meant high altitude
Southward the barren red simply merged into distance
The field of craters rose in high dark wheels toward the dominating peaks
When Gale withdrew his gaze from the magnitude of these spaces and heights the crater beneath him seemed dwarfed
Yet while he gazed it spread and deepened and multiplied its ragged lines
No he could not grasp the meaning of size or distance here
There was too much to stun the sight
But the mood in which nature had created this convulsed world of lava seized hold upon him
Meanwhile the hours passed
As the sun climbed the clear steely lights vanished the blue hazes deepened and slowly the glistening surfaces of lava turned redder
Ladd was concerned to discover that Yaqui was missing from his outlook upon the high point
Jim Lash came out of the shady crevice and stood up to buckle on his cartridge belt
His narrow gray glance slowly roved from the height of lava down along the slope paused in doubt and then swept on to resurvey the whole vast eastern dip of the plateau
I reckon my eyes are pore he said
Mebbe its this damn red glare
Anyway whats them creepin spots up there
Shore I seen them
Mountain sheep replied Ladd
Guess again Laddy
Dick I reckon youd better flash the glass up the slope
Gale adjusted the field glass and began to search the lava beginning close at hand and working away from him
Presently the glass became stationary
I see half a dozen small animals brown in color
They look like sheep
But I couldnt distinguish mountain sheep from antelope
Shore theyre bighorn said Laddy
I reckon if youll pull around to the east an search under that long wall of lavathereyoull see what I see added Jim
The glass climbed and circled wavered an instant then fixed steady as a rock
There was a breathless silence
Fourteen horsestwo packedsome mountedothers without riders and lame said Gale slowly
Yaqui appeared far up the trail coming swiftly
Presently he saw the rangers and halted to wave his arms and point
Then he vanished as if the lava had opened beneath him
Lemme that glass suddenly said Jim Lash
Im seein red I tell youWell pore as my eyes are they had it right
Rojas an his outfit have left the trail
Jim you aint meanin theyve taken to that awful slope
queried Ladd
I sure do
There they arestill comin but goin down too
Mebbe Rojas is crazy but it begins to look like he Laddy Ill be danged if the Greaser bunch hasnt vamoosed
Gone out of sight
Right there not a half mile away the whole caboodlegone
Shore theyre behind a crust or have gone down into a rut suggested Ladd
Theyll show again in a minute
Look sharp boys for Im figgerin Rojas ll spread his men
Minutes passed but nothing moved upon the slope
Each man crawled up to a vantage point along the crest of rotting lava
The watchers were careful to peer through little notches or from behind a spur and the constricted nature of their hidingplace kept them close together
Ladds muttering grew into a growl then lapsed into the silence that marked his companions
From time to time the rangers looked inquiringly at Gale
The field glass however like the naked sight could not catch the slightest moving object out there upon the lava
A long hour of slow mounting suspense wore on
Shore its all goin to be as queer as the Yaqui said Ladd
Indeed the strange mien the silent action the somber character of the Indian had not been without effect upon the minds of the men
Then the weird desolate tragic scene added to the vague sense of mystery
And now the disappearance of Rojass band the long wait in the silence the boding certainty of invisible foes crawling circling closer and closer lent to the situation a final touch that made it unreal
Im reckonin theres a mind behind them Greasers replied Jim
Or mebbe we aint done Rojas creditIf somethin would only come off
That Lash the coolest most provokingly nonchalant of men in times of peril should begin to show a nervous strain was all the more indicative of a suble pervading unreality
Boys look sharp
suddenly called Lash
Low down to the left mebbe three hundred yards
See along by them seams of lava behind the choyas
First off I thought it was a sheep
But its the YaquiCrawlin swift as a lizard
Cant you see him
It was a full moment before Jims companions could locate the Indian
Flat as a snake Yaqui wound himself along with incredible rapidity
His advance was all the more remarkable for the fact that he appeared to pass directly under the dreaded choyas
Sometimes he paused to lift his head and look
He was directly in line with a huge whorl of lava that rose higher than any point on the slope
This spur was a quarter of a mile from the position of the rangers
Shore hes headin for that high place said Ladd
Hes goin slow now
There hes stopped behind some choyas
Hes gettin upno hes kneelinNow what the hell
Laddy take a peek at the side of that lava ridge sharply called Jim
I guess mebbe somethin aint comin off
See
Theres Rojas an his outfit climbin
Dont make out no hossesDick use your glass an tell us whats doin
Ill watch Yaqui an tell you what his move means
Clearly and distinctly almost as if he could have touched them Gale had Rojas and his followers in sight
They were toiling up the rough lava on foot
They were heavily armed
Spurs chaps jackets scarfs were not in evidence
Gale saw the lean swarthy faces the black straggly hair the ragged soiled garments which had once been white
Theyre almost up now Gale was saying
There
They halt on top
I see Rojas
He looks wild
By
fellows an Indian
Its a Papago
Beldings old herderThe Indian points this waythen down
Hes showing Rojas the lay of the trail
Boys Yaquis in range of that bunch said Jim swiftly
Hes raisin his rifle slowLord how slow he isHes covered some one
Which one I cant say
But I think hell pick Rojas
The Yaqui can shoot
Hell pick Rojas added Gale grimly
Rojasyesyes
cried Thorne in passion of suspense
Not on your life
Ladds voice cut in with scorn
Gentlemen you can gamble Yaqui ll kill the Papago
That traitor Indian knows these sheep haunts
Hes tellin Rojas A sharp rifle shot rang out
Laddys right called Gale
The Papagos hithis arm fallsThere he tumbles
More shots rang out
Yaqui was seen standing erect firing rapidly at the darting Mexicans
For all Gale could make out no second bullet took effect
Rojas and his men vanished behind the bulge of lava
Then Yaqui deliberately backed away from his postion
He made no effort to run or hide
Evidently he watched cautiously for signs of pursuers in the ruts and behind the choyas
Presently he turned and came straight toward the position of the rangers sheered off perhaps a hundred paces below it and disappeared in a crevice
Plainly his intention was to draw pursuers within rifle shot
Shore Jim you had your wish
Somethin come off said Ladd
An Im sayin thank God for the Yaqui
That Papago d have ruined us
Even so mebbe hes told Rojas moren enough to make us sweat blood
He had a chance to kill Rojas cried out the drawnfaced passionate Thorne
He didnt take itHe didnt take it
Only Ladd appeared to be able to answer the cavalrymans poignant cry
Listen son he said and his voice rang
Weall know how you feel
An if Id had that one shot never in the world could I have picked the Papago guide
Id have had to kill Rojas
Thats the white man of it
But Yaqui was right
Only an Indian could have done it
You can gamble the Papago alive meant slim chance for us
Because hed led straight to where Mercedes is hidden an then wed have left cover to fight it outWhen you come to think of the Yaquis hate for Greasers when you just seen him pass up a shot at onewell I dont know how to say what I mean but damn me my sombrerro is off to the Indian
I reckon so an I reckon the balls opened rejoined Lash and now that former nervous impatience so unnatural to him was as if it had never been
He was smilingly cool and his voice had almost a caressing note
He tapped the breech of his Winchester with a sinewy brown hand and he did not appear to be addressing any one in particular
Yaquis opened the ball
Look up your pardners there gents an get ready to dance
Another wait set in them and judging by the more direct rays of the sun and a receding of the little shadows cast by the choyas Gale was of the opinion that it was a long wait
But it seemed short
The four men were lying under the bank of a half circular hole in the lava
It was notched and cracked and its rim was fringed by choyas
It sloped down and opened to an unobstructed view of the crater
Gale had the upper position fartherest to the right and therefore was best shielded from possible fire from the higher ridges of the rim some three hundred yards distant
Jim came next well hidden in a crack
The positions of Thorne and Ladd were most exposed
They kept sharp lookout over the uneven rampart of their hidingplace
The sun passed the zenith began to slope westward and to grow hotter as it sloped
The men waited and waited
Gale saw no impatience even in Thorne
The sultry air seemed to be laden with some burden or quality that was at once composed of heat menace color and silence
Even the light glancing up from the lava seemed red and the silence had substance
Sometimes Gale felt that it was unbearable
Yet he made no effort to break it
Suddenly this dead stillness was rent by a shot clear and stinging close at hand
It was from a rifle not a carbine
With startling quickness a cry followeda cry that pierced Galeit was so thin so highkeyed so different from all other cries
It was the involuntary human shriek at death
Yaquis called out another pardner said Jim Lash laconically
Carbines began to crack
The reports were quick light like sharp spats without any ring
Gale peered from behind the edge of his covert
Above the ragged wave of lava floated faint whitish clouds all that was visible of smokeless powder
Then Gale made out round spots dark against the background of red and in front of them leaped out small tongues of fire
Ladds 405 began to spang with its beautiful sound of power
Thorne was firing somewhat wildly Gale thought
Then Jim Lash pushed his Winchester over the rim under a choya and between shots Gale could hear him singing Turn the lady turnturn the lady turnAlaman leftSwing your pardnersForward an backTurn the lady turn
Gale got into the fight himself not so sure that he hit any of the round bobbing objects he aimed at but growing sure of himself as action liberated something forced and congested within his breast
Then over the position of the rangers came a hail of steel bullets
Those that struck the lava hissed away into the crater those that came biting through the choyas made a sound which resembled a sharp ripping of silk
Bits of cactus stung Gales face and he dreaded the flying thorns more than he did the flying bullets
Hold on boys called Ladd as he crouched down to reload his rifle
Save your shells
The greasers are spreadin on us some goin down below Yaqui others movin up for that high ridge
When they get up there Im damned if it wont be hot for us
There aint room for all of us to hide here
Ladd raised himself to peep over the rim
Shots were now scattering and all appeared to come from below
Emboldened by this he rose higher
A shot from in front a rip of bullet through the choya a spat of something hitting Ladds face a steel missle hissing onwardthese inseparably blended sounds were all registered by Gales sensitive ear
With a curse Ladd tumbled down into the hole
His face showed a great gray blotch and starting blood
Gale felt a sickening assurance of desperate injury to the ranger
He ran to him calling Laddy
Laddy
Shore I ant plugged
Its a damn choya burr
The bullet knocked it in my face
Pull it out
The oval longspiked cone was firmly imbedded in Ladds cheek
Blood streamed down his face and neck
Carefully yet with no thought of pain to himself Gale Tried to pull the cactus joint away
It was as firm as if it had been nailed there
That was the damnable feature of the barbed thorns once set they held on as that strange plant held to its desert life
Ladd began to writhe and sweat mingled with the blood on his face
He cursed and raved and his movements made it almost impossible for Gale to do anything
Put your knifeblade under an tear it out
shouted Ladd hoarsely
Thus ordered Gale slipped a long blade in between the imbedded thorns and with a powerful jerk literally tore the choya out of Ladds quivering flesh
Then where the rangers face was not red and raw it certainly was white
A volley of shots from a different angle was followed by the quick ring of steel bullets striking the lava all around Gale
His first idea as he heard the projectiles sing and hum and whine away into the air was that they were coming from above him
He looked up to see a number of low white and dark knobs upon the high point of lava
They had not been there before
Then he saw little pale leaping tongues of fire
As he dodged down he distinctly heard a bullet strike Ladd
At the same instant he seemed to hear Thorne cry out and fall and Lashs boots scrape rapidly away
Ladd fell backward still holding the 405
Gale dragged him into the shelter of his own positoin and dreading to look at him took up the heavy weapon
It was with a kind of savage strength that he gripped the rifle and it was with a cold and deadly intent that he aimed and fired
The first Greaser huddled low let his carbine go clattering down and then crawled behind the rim
The second and third jerked back
The fourth seemed to flop up over the crest of lava
A dark arm reached for him clutched his leg tried to drag him up
It was in vain
Wildly grasping at the air the bandit fell slid down a steep shelf rolled over the rim to go hurtling down out of sight
Fingering the hot rifle with closepressed hands Gale watched the sky line along the high point of lava
It remained unbroken
As his passion left him he feared to look back at his companions and the cold chill returned to his breast
ShoreIm damn gladthem Greasers aint usin softnose bullets drawled a calm voice
Swift as lightning Gale whirled
Laddy
I thought you were done for cried Gale with a break in his voice
I aint amindin the bullet much
But that choya joint took my nerve an you can gamble on it
Dick this holes pretty high up aint it
The rangers blouse was open at the neck and on his right shoulder under the collar bone was a small hole just beginning to bleed
Sure its high Laddy replied Gale gladly
Went clear through clean as a whistle
He tore a handkerchief into two parts made wads and pressing them close over the wounds he bound them there with Ladds scarf
Shore its funny how a bullet can floor a man an then not do any damage said Ladd
I felt a zip of wind an somethin like a pat on my chest an down I went
Well so much for the small caliber with their steel bullets
Supposin Id connected with a 405
Laddy IIm afraid Thornes done for whispered Gale
Hes lying over there in that crack
I can see part of him
He doesnt move
I was wonderin if Id have to tell you that
Dick he went down hard hit fallin you know limp an soggy
It was a moral cinch one of us would get it in this fight but God
Im sorry Thorne had to be the man
Laddy maybe hes not dead replied Gale
He called aloud to his friend
There was no answer
Ladd got up and after peering keenly at the height of lava he strode swiftly across the space
It was only a dozen steps to the crack in the lava whereThorne had fallen head first
Ladd bent over went to his knees so that Gale saw only his head
Then he appeared rising with arms round the cavalryman
He dragged him across the hole to the sheltered corner that alone afforded protection
He had scarcely reached it when a carbine cracked and a bullet struck the flinty lava striking sparks then singing away into the air
Thorne was either dead or unconscious and Gale with a contracting throat and numb heart decided for the former
Not so Ladd who probed the bloody gash on Thornes temple and then felt his breast
Hes alive an not bad hurt
That bullet hit him glancin
Shore them steel bullets are some lucky for us
Dick you neednt look so glum
I tell you he aint bad hurt
I felt his skull with my finger
Theres no hole in it
Wash him off an tie Wow
did you get the wind of that one
An mebbe it didnt sing off the lava
Dick look after Thorne now while I The completion of his speech was the stirring ring of the 405 and then he uttered a laugh that was unpleasant
Shore greaser theres a mans size bullet for you
No slim sharppointed steeljacket nail
Im takin it on me to believe youre appreciatin of the 405 seein as you dont make no fuss
It was indeed a joy to Gale to find that Thorne had not received a wound necessarily fatal though it was serious enough
Gale bathed and bound it and laid the cavalryman against the slant of the bank his head high to lessen the probability of bleeding
As Gale straightened up Ladd muttered low and deep and swung the heavy rifle around to the left
Far along the slope a figure moved
Ladd began to work the lever of the Winchester and to shoot
At every shot the heavy firearm sprang up and the recoil made Ladds shoulder give back
Gale saw the bullets strike the lava behind beside before the fleeing Mexican sending up dull puffs of dust
On the sixth shot he plunged down out of sight either hit or frightened into seeking cover
Dick mebbe theres one or two left above but we neednt figure much on it said Ladd as loading the rifle he jerked his fingers quickly from the hot breech
Listen
Jim an Yaqui are hittin it up lively down below
Ill sneak down there
You stay here an keep about half an eye peeled up yonder an keep the rest my way
Ladd crossed the hole climbed down into the deep crack where Thorne had fallen and then went stooping along with only his head above the level
Presently he disappeared
Gale having little to fear from the high ridge directed most of his attention toward the point beyond which Ladd had gone
The firing had become desultory and the light carbine shots outnumbered the sharp rifle shots five to one
Gale made a note of the fact that for some little time he had not heard the unmistakable report of Jim Lashs automatic
Then ensued a long interval in which the desert silence seemed to recover its grip
The 405 ripped it asunderspangspang spang
Gale fancied he heard yells
There were a few pattering shots still farther down the trail
Gale had an uneasy conviction that Rojas and some of his band might go straight to the waterhole
It would be hard to dislodge even a few men from that retreat
There seemed a lull in the battle
Gale ventured to stand high and screened behind choyas he swept the threequarter circle of lava with his glass
In the distance he saw horses but no riders
Below him down the slope along the crater rim and the trail the lava was bare of all except tufts of choya
Gale gathered assurance
It looked as if the day was favoring his side
Then Thorne coming partly to consciousness engaged Gales care
The cavalryman stirred and moaned called for water and then for Mercedes
Gale held him back with a strong hand and presently he was once more quiet
For the first time in hours as it seemed Gale took note of the physical aspect of his surroundings
He began to look upon them without keen gaze strained for crouching form or bobbing head or spouting carbine
Either Gales sense of color and proportion had become deranged during the fight or the encompassing air and the desert had changed
Even the sun had changed
It seemed lowering oval in shape magenta in hue and it had a surface that gleamed like oil on water
Its red rays shone through red haze
Distances that had formerly ben clearly outlined were now dim obscured
The yawning chasm was not the same
It circled wider redder deeper
It was a weird ghastly mouth of hell
Gale stood fascinated unable to tell how much he saw was real how much exaggeration of overwrought emotions
There was no beauty here but an unparalleled grandeur a sublime scene of devastation and desolation which might have had its counterpart upon the burnedout moon
The mood that gripped Gale now added to its somber portent an unshakable foreboding of calamity
He wrestled with the spell as if it were a physical foe
Reason and intelligence had their voices in his mind but the moment was not one wherein these things could wholly control
He felt life strong withing his breast yet there a step away was death yawning glaring smoky red
It was a momentan hour for a savage born bred developed in this scarred and blasted place of jagged depths and red distances and silences never meant to be broken
Since Gale was not a savage he fought that call of the red gods which sent him back down the long ages toward his primitive day
His mind combated his sense of sight and the hearing that seemed useless and his mind did not win all the victory
Something fatal was here hanging in the balance as the red haze hung along the vast walls of that crater of hell
Suddenly harsh prolonged yells brought him to his feet and the unrealities vanished
Far down the trails where the crater rims closed in the deep fissure he saw moving forms
They were three in number
Two of them ran nimbly across the lava bridge
The third staggered far behind
It was Ladd
He appeared hard hit
He dragged at the heavy rifle which he seemed unable to raise
The yells came from him
He was calling the Yaqui
Gales heart stood still momentarily
Here then was the catastrophe
He hardly dared sweep that fissure with his glass
The two fleeing figures haltedturned to fire at Ladd
Gale recognized the foremost onesmall compact gaudy
Rojas
The bandits arm was outstretched
Puffs of white smoke rose and shots rapped out
When Ladd went down Rojas threw his gun aside and with a wild yell bounded over the lava
His companion followed
A tide of passion first hot as fire then cold as ice rushed over Gale when he saw Rojas take the trail toward Mercedess hidingplace
The little bandit appeared to have the surefootedness of a mountain sheep
The Mexican following was not so sure or fast
He turned back
Gale heard the trenchant bark of the 405
Ladd was kneeling
He shot againagain
The retreating bandit seemed to run full into an invisible obstacle then fell lax inert lifeless
Rojas sped on unmindful of the spurts of dust about him
Yaqui high above Ladd was also firing at the bandit
Then both rifles were emptied
Rojas turned at a high break in the trail
He shook a defiant hand and his exulting yell pealed faintly to Gales ears
About him there was something desperate magnificent
Then he clambered down the trail
Ladd dropped the 405 and rising gun in hand he staggered toward the bridge of lava
Before he had crossed it Yaqui came bounding down the slope and in one splendid leap he cleared the fissure
He ran beyond the trail and disappeared on the lava above
Rojas had not seen this sudden darting move of the Indian
Gale felt himself bitterly powerless to aid in that pursuit
He could only watch
He wondered fearfully what had become of Lash
Presently when Rojas came out of the cracks and ruts of lava there might be a chance of disabling him by a long shot
His progress was now slow
But he was making straight for Mercedess hidingplace
What was it leading him therean eagle eye or hate or instinct
Why did he go on when there could be no turning back for him on that trail
Ladd was slow heavy staggering on the trail but he was relentless
Only death could stop the ranger now
Surely Rojas must have known that when he chose the trail
From time to time Gale caught glimpses of Yaquis dark figure stealing along the higher rim of the crater
He was making for a point above the bandit
Momentsendless moments dragged by
The lowering sun colored only the upper half of the crater walls
Far down the depths were murky blue
Again Gale felt the insupportable silence
The red haze became a transparent veil before his eyes
Sinister evil brooding waiting seemed that yawning abyss
Ladd staggered along the trail at times he crawled
The Yaqui gained he might have had wings he leaped from jagged crust to jagged crust his surefootedness was a wonderful thing
But for Gale the marvel of that endless period of watching was the purpose of the bandit Rojas
He had now no weapon
Gales glass made this fact plain
There was death behind him death below him death before him and though he could not have known it death above him
He never falterednever made a misstep upon the narrow flinty trail
When he reached the lower end of the level ledge Gales poignant doubt became a certainty
Rojas had seen Mercedes
It was incredible yet Gale believed it
Then his heart clamped as in an icy vise Gale threw forward the Remington and sinking on one knee began to shoot
He emptied the magazine
Puffs of dust near Rojas did not even make him turn
As Gale began to reload he was horrorstricken by a low cry from Thorne
The cavalryman had recovered consciousness
He was half raised pointing with shaking hand at the opposite ledge
His distended eyes were riveted upon Rojas
He was trying to utter speech that would not come
Gale wheeled rigid now steeling himself to one last forlorn hope that Mercedes could defend herself
She had a gun
He doubted not at all that she would use it
But remembering her terror of this savage he feared for her
Rojas reached the level of the ledge
He halted
He crouched
It was the act of a panther
Manifestly he saw Mercedes within the cave
Then faint shots patted the air broke in quick echo
Rojas went down as if struck a heavy blow
He was hit
But even as Gale yelled in sheer madness the bandit leaped erect
He seemed too quick too supple to be badly wounded
A slight dark figure flashed out of the cave
Mercedes
She backed against the wall
Gale saw a puff of whiteheard a report
But the bandit lunged at her
Mercedes ran not to try to pass him but straight for the precipice
Her intention was plain
But Rojas oustripped her even as she reached the verge
Then a piercing scream pealed across the cratera scream of despair
Gale closed his eyes
He could not bear to see more
Thorne echoed Mercedess scream
Gale looked round just in time to leap and catch the cavalryman as he staggered apparently for the steep slope
And then as Gale dragged him back both fell
Gale saved his friend but he plunged into a choya
He drew his hands away full of the great glistening cones of thorns
For Gods sake Gale shoot
Shoot
Kill her
Kill herCant youseeRojas Thorne fainted
Gale stunned for the instant stood with uplifted hands and gazed from Thorne across the crater
Rojas had not killed Mercedes
He was overpowering her
His actions seemed slow wearing purposeful
Hers were violent
Like a trapped shewolf Mercedes was fighting
She tore struggled flung herself
Rojass intention was terribly plain
In agony now both mental and physical cold and sick and weak Gale gripped his rifle and aimed at the struggling forms on the ledge
He pulled the trigger
The bullet struck up a cloud of red dust close to the struggling couple
Again Gale fired hoping to hit Rojas praying to kill Mercedes
The bullet struck high
A thirdfourthfifth time the Remington spokein vain
The rifle fell from Gales racked hands
How horribly plain that fiends intention
Gale tried to close his eyes but could not
He prayed wildly for a sudden blindness to faint as Thorne had fainted
But he was transfixed to the spot with eyes that pierced the red light
Mercedes was growing weaker seemed about to collapse
Oh Jim Lash are you dead
cried Gale
Oh LaddyOh Yaqui
Suddenly a dark form literally fell down the wall behind the ledge where Rojas fought the girl
It sank in a heap then bounded erect
Yaqui
screamed Gale and he waved his bleeding hands till the blood bespattered his face
Then he choked
Utterance became impossible
The Indian bent over Rojas and flung him against the wall
Mercedes sinking back lay still
When Rojas got up the Indian stood between him and escape from the ledge
Rojas backed the other way along the narrowing shelf of lava
His manner was abject stupefied
Slowly he stepped backward
It was then that Gale caught the white gleam of a knife in Yaquis hand
Rojas turned and ran
He rounded a corner of wall where the footing was precarious
Yaqui followed slowly
His figure was dark and menacing
But he was not in a hurry
When he passed off the ledge Rojas was edging farther and farther along the wall
He was clinging now to the lava creeping inch by inch
Perhaps he had thought to work around the buttress or climb over it
Evidently he went as far as possible and there he clung an unscalable wall above the abyss beneath
The approach of the Yaqui was like a slow dark shadow of gloom
If it seemed so to the stricken Gale what must it have been to Rojas
He appeared to sink against the wall
The Yaqui stole closer and closer
He was the savage now and for him the moment must have been glorified
Gale saw him gaze up at the great circling walls of the crater then down into the depths
Perhaps the red haze hanging above him or the purple haze below or the deep caverns in the lava held for Yaqui spirits of the desert his gods to whom he called
Perhaps he invoked shadows of his loved ones and his race calling them in this moment of vengeance
Gale heardor imagined he heardthat wild strange Yaqui cry
Then the Indian stepped close to Rojas and bent low keeping out of reach
How slow were his motions
Would Yaqui nevernever end itA wail drifted across the crater to Gales ears
Rojas fell backward and plunged sheer
The bank of white choyas caught him held him upon their steel spikes
How long did the dazed Gale sit there watching Rojas wrestling and writhing in convulsive frenzy
The bandit now seemed mad to win the delayed death
When he broke free he was a white patched object no longer human a ball of choya burrs and he slipped off the bank to shoot down and down into the purple depths of the crater
XIII Changes At Forlorn River The first of March saw the federal occupation of the garrison at Casita
After a short decisive engagement the rebels were dispersed into small bands and driven eastward along the boundary line toward Nogales
It was the destiny of Forlorn River however never to return to the slow sleepy tenor of its former existence
Beldings predictions came true
That straggling line of homeseekers was but a forerunner of the real invasion of Altar Valley
Refugees from Mexico and from Casita spread the word that water and wood and grass and land were to be had at Forlorn River and as if by magic the white tents and red adobe houses sprang up to glisten in the sun
Belding was happier than he had been for a long time
He believed that evil days for Forlorn River along with the apathy and lack of enterprise were in the past
He hired a couple of trustworthy Mexicans to ride the boundary line and he settled down to think of ranching and irrigation and mining projects
Every morning he expected to receive some word form Sonoyta or Yuma telling him that Yaqui had guided his party safely across the desert
Belding was simpleminded a man more inclined to action than reflection
When the complexities of life hemmed him in he groped his way out never quite understanding
His wife had always been a mystery to him
Nell was sunshine most of the time but like the sundominated desert she was subject to strange changes wilful stormy sudden
It was enough for Belding now to find his wife in a lighter happier mood and to see Nell dreamily turning a ring round and round the third finger of her left hand and watching the west
Every day both mother and daughter appeared farther removed from the past darkly threatening days
Belding was hearty in his affections but undemonstrative
If there was any sentiment in his makeup it had an outlet in his memory of Blanco Diablo and a longing to see him
Often Belding stopped his work to gaze out over the desert toward the west
When he thought of his rangers and Thorne and Mercedes he certainly never forgot his horse
He wondered if Diablo was running walking resting if Yaqui was finding water and grass
In March with the short desert winter over the days began to grow warm
The noon hours were hot and seemed to give promise of the white summer blaze and blasting furnace wind soon to come
No word was received from the rangers
But this caused Belding no concern and it seemed to him that his women folk considered no news good news
Among the many changes coming to pass in Forlorn River were the installing of postoffice service and the building of a mescal drinkinghouse
Belding had worked hard for the post office but he did not like the idea of a saloon for Forlorn River
Still that was an inevitable evil
The Mexicans would have mescal
Belding had kept the little border hamlet free of an establishment for distillation of the fiery cactus drink
A good many Americans drifted into Forlorn Riverminers cowboys prospectors outlaws and others of nondescript character and these men of course made the saloon which was also an inn their headquarters
Belding with Carter and other old residents saw the need of a sheriff for Forlorn River
One morning early in this spring month while Belding was on his way from the house to the corrals he saw Nell running Blanco Jose down the road at a gait that amazed him
She did not take the turn of the road to come in by the gate
She put Jose at a fourfoot wire fence and came clattering into the yard
Nell must have another tantrum said Belding
Shes long past due
Blanco Jose like the other white horses was big of frame and heavy and thunder rolled from under his great hoofs
Nell pulled him up and as he pounded and slid to a halt in a cloud of dust she swung lightly down
It did not take more than half an eye for Belding to see that she was furious
Nell whats come off now
asked Belding
Im not going to tell you she replied and started away leading Jose toward the corral
Belding leisurely followed
She went into the corral removed Joses bridle and led him to the wateringtrough
Belding came up and without saying anything began to unbuckle Joses saddle girths
But he ventured a look at Nell
The red had gone from her face and he was surprised to see her eyes brimming with tears
Most assuredly this was not one of Nells tantrums
While taking off Joses saddle and hanging it in the shed Belding pondered in his slow way
When he came back to the corral Nell had her face against the bars and she was crying
He slipped a big arm around her and waited
Although it was not often expressed there was a strong attachment between them
Dad I dont want you to think me aa baby any more she said
Ive been insulted
With a specific fact to make clear thought in Beldings mind he was never slow
I knew something unusual had come off
I guess youd better tell me
Dad I will if you promise
What
Not to mention it to mother not to pack a gun down there and never never tell Dick
Belding was silent
Seldom did he make promises readily
Nell sure something must have come off for you to ask all that
If you dont promise Ill never tell thats all she declared firmly
Belding deliberated a little longer
He knew the girl
Well I promise not to tell mother he said presently and seeing youre here safe and well I guess I wont go packing a gun down there wherever that is
But I wont promise to keep anything from Dick that perhaps he ought to know
Dad what would Dick do ifif he were here and I were to tell him IdId been horribly insulted
I guess that d depend
Mostly you know Dick does what you want
But you couldnt stop himnobody couldif there was reason a mans reason to get started
Remember what he did to RojasNell tell me whats happened
Nell regaining her composure wiped her eyes and smoothed back her hair
The other day Wednesday she began I was coming home and in front of that mescal drinkingplace there was a crowd
It was a noisy crowd
I didnt want to walk out into the street or seem afraid
But I had to do both
There were several young men and if they werent drunk they certainly were rude
I never saw them before but I think they must belong to the mining company that was run out of Sonora by rebels
Mrs Carter was telling me
Anyway these young fellows were Americans
They stretched themselves across the walk and smiled at me
I had to go out in the road
One of them the rudest followed me
He was a big fellow redfaced with prominent eyes and a bold look
He came up beside me and spoke to me
I ran home
And as I ran I heard his companions jeering
Well today just now when I was riding up the valley road I came upon the same fellows
They had instruments and were surveying
Remembering Dick and how he always wished for an instrument to help work out his plan for irrigation I was certainly surprised to see these strangers surveyingand surveying upon Laddys plot of land
It was a sandy road there and Jose happened to be walking
So I reined in and asked these engineers what they were doing
The leader who was that same bold fellow who had followed me seemed much pleased at being addressed
He was swaggeringtoo friendly not my idea of a gentleman at all
He said he was glad to tell me he was going to run water all over Altar Valley
Dad you can bet that made me wild
That was Dicks plan his discovery and here were surveyors on Laddys claim
Then I told him that he was working on private land and hed better get off
He seemed to forget his flirty proclivities in amazement
Then he looked cunning
I read his mind
It was news to him that all the land along the valley had been taken up
He said something about not seeing any squatters on the land and then he shut up tight on that score
But he began to be flirty again
He got hold of Joses bridle and before I could catch my breath he said I was a peach and that he wanted to make a date with me that his name was Chase that he owned a gold mine in Mexico
He said a lot more I didnt gather but when he called me Dearie Iwell I lost my temper
I jerked on the bridle and told him to let go
He held on and rolled his eyes at me
I dare say he imagined he was a gentlemen to be infatuated with
He seemed sure of conquest
One thing certain he didnt know the least bit about horses
It scared me the way he got in front of Jose
I thanked my stars I wasnt up on Blanco Diablo
Well Dad Im a little ashamed now but I was mad
I slashed him across the face with my quirt
Jose jumped and knocked Mr Chase into the sand
I didnt get the horse under control till I was out of sight of those surveyors and then I let him run home
Nell I guess you punished the fellow enough
Maybe hes only a conceited softy
But I dont like that sort of thing
It isnt Western
I guess he wont be so smart next time
Any fellow would remember being hit by Blanco Jose
If youd been up on Diablo wed have to bury Mr
Chase
Thank goodness I wasnt
Im sorry now Dad
Perhaps the fellow was hurt
but what could I do
Lets forget all about it and Ill be careful where I ride in the futureDad what does it mean this surveying around Forlorn River
I dont know Nell replied Belding thoughtfully
It worries me
It looks good for Forlorn River but bad for Dicks plan to irrigate the valley
Lord Id hate to have some one forestall Dick on that
No no we wont let anybody have Dicks rights declared Nell
Where have I been keeping myself not to know about these surveyors
muttered Belding
They must have just come
Go see Mrs Cater
She told me there were strangers in town Americans who had mining interests in Sonora and were run out by Orozco
Find out what theyre doing Dad
Belding discovered that he was indeed the last man of consequence in Forlorn River to learn of the arrival of Ben Chase and son mineowners and operators in Sonora
They with a force of miners had been besieged by rebels and finally driven off their property
This property was not destroyed but held for ransom
And the Chases pending developments had packed outfits and struck for the border
Casita had been their objective point but for some reason which Belding did not learn they had arrived instead at Forlorn River
It had taken Ben Chase just one day to see the possibilities of Altar Valley and in three days he had men at work
Belding returned home without going to see the Chases and their operations
He wanted to think over the situation
Next morning he went out to the valley to see for himself
Mexicans were hastily erecting adobe houses upon Ladds one hundred and sixty acres upon Dick Gales upon Jim Lashs and Thornes
There were men staking the valley floor and the river bed
That was sufficient for Belding
He turned back toward town and headed for the camp of these intruders
In fact the surroundings of Forlorn River except on the river side reminded Belding of the mushroom growth of a newly discovered mining camp
Tents were everywhere adobe shacks were in all stages of construction rough clapboard houses were going up
the latest of this work was new and surprising to Belding all because he was a busy man with no chance to hear village gossip
When he was directed to the headquarters of the Chase Mining Company he went thither in slowgrowing wrath
He came to a big tent with a huge canvas fly stretched in front under which sat several men in their shirt sleeves
They were talking and smoking
My names Belding
I want to see this Mr Chase said Belding gruffly
Slowwitted as Belding was and absorbed in his own feelings he yet saw plainly that his advent was disturbing to these men
They looked alarmed exchanged glances and then quickly turned to him
One of them a tall rugged man with sharp face and shrewd eyes and white hair got up and offered his hand
Im Chase senior he said
My son Radford Chase is here somewhere
Youre Belding the line inspector I take it
I meant to call on you
He seemed a roughandready loudspoken man withal cordial enough
Yes Im the inspector replied Belding ignoring the proffered hand and Id like to know what in the hell you mean by taking up land claimsstaked ground that belongs to my rangers
Land claims
slowly echoed Chase studying his man
Were taking up only unclaimed land
Thats a lie
You couldnt miss the stakes
Well Mr Belding as to that I think my men did run across some staked ground
But we recognize only squatters
If your rangers think theyve got property just because they drove a few stakes in the ground theyre much mistaken
A squatter has to build a house and live on his land so long according to law before he owns it
This argument was unanswerable and Belding knew it
According to law
exclaimed Belding
Then you own up youve jumped our claims
Mr Belding Im a plain business man
I come along
I see a good opening
Nobody seems to have tenable grants
I stake out claims locate squatters start to build
It seems to me your rangers have overlooked certain precautions
Thats unfortunate for them
Im prepared to hold my claim and to back all the squatters who work for me
If you dont like it you can carry the matter to Tucson
The law will uphold me
The law
Say on this southwest border we havent any law except a mans word and a gun
Then youll find United States law has come along with Ben Chase replied the other snapping his fingers
He was still smooth outspoken but his mask had fallen
Youre not a Westerner
queried Belding
No Im from Illinois
I thought the West hadnt bred you
I know your kind
Youd last a long time on the Texas border now wouldnt you
Youre one of the land and water hogs that has come to root in the West
Youre like the timber sharkstake it all and leave none for those who follow
Mr Chase the West would fare better and last longer if men like you were driven out
You cant drive me out
Im not so sure of that
Wait till my rangers come back
I wouldnt be in your boots
Dont mistake me
I dont suppose you could be accused of stealing another mans ideas or plan but sure youve stolen these four claims
Maybe the law might uphold you
But the spirit not the letter counts with us bordermen
See here Belding I think youre taking the wrong view of the matter
Im going to develop this valley
Youd do better to get in with me
Ive a proposition to make you about that strip of land of yours facing the river
You cant make any deals with me
I wont have anything to do with you
Belding abruptly left the camp and went home
Nell met him probably intended to question him but one look into his face confirmed her fears
She silently turned away
Belding realized he was powerless to stop Chase and he was sick with disappointment for the ruin of Dicks hopes and his own
XIV A Lost Son Time passed
The population of Forlorn River grew apace
Belding who had once bee the head of the community found himself a person of little consequence
Even had he desired it he would not have had any voice in the selection of postmaster sheriff and a few other officials
The Chases divided their labors between Forlorn River and their Mexican gold mine which had been restored to them
The desert trips between these two places were taken in automobiles
A months time made the motor cars almost as familiar a sight in Forlorn River as they had been in Casita before the revolution
Belding was not so busy as he had been formerly
As he lost ambition he began to find less work to do
His wrath at the usurping Chases increased as he slowly realized his powerlessness to cope with such men
They were promoters men of big interests and wide influence in the Southwest
The more they did for Forlorn River the less reason there seemed to be for his own grievance
He had to admit that it was personal that he and Gale and the rangers would never have been able to develop the resources of the valley as these men were doing it
All day long he heard the heavy booming blasts and the rumble of avalanches up in the gorge
Chases men were dynamiting the cliffs in the narrow box canyon
They were making the dam just as Gale had planned to make it
When this work of blasting was over Belding experienced a relief
He would not now be continually reminded of his and Gales loss
Resignation finally came to him
But he could not reconcile himself to misfortune for Gale
Moreover Belding had other worry and strain
April arrived with no news of the rangers
From Casita came vague reports of raiders in the Sonoyta countryreports impossible to verify until his Mexican rangers returned
When these men rode in one of them Gonzales an intelligent and reliable halfbreed said he had met prospectors at the oasis
They had just come in on the Camino del Diablo reported a terrible trip of heat and drought and not a trace of the Yaquis party
That settles it declared Belding
Yaqui never went to Sonoyta
Hes circled round to the Devils Road and the rangers Mercedes Thorne the horsestheyIm afraid they have been lost in the desert
Its an old story on Camino del Diablo
He had to tell Nell that and it was an ordeal which left him weak
Mrs Belding listened to him and was silent for a long time while she held the stricken Nell to her breast
Then she opposed his convictions with that quiet strength so characteristic of her arguments
Well then decided Belding Rojas headed the rangers at Papago Well or the Tanks
Tom when you are down in the mouth you use poor judgment she went on
You know only by a miracle could Rojas or anybody have headed those white horses
Wheres your old stubborn confidence
Yaqui was up on Diablo
Dick was up on Sol
And there were the other horses
They could not have been headed or caught
Miracles dont happen
All right mother its sure good to hear you said Belding
She always cheered him and now he grasped at straws
Im not myself these days dont mistake that
Tell us what you think
You always say you feel things when you really dont know them
I can say little more than what you said yourself the night Mercedes was taken away
You told Laddy to trust Yaqui that he was a godsend
He might go south into some wild Sonora valley
He might lead Rojas into a trap
He would find water and grass where no Mexican or American could
But mother theyre gone seven weeks
Seven weeks
At the most I gave them six weeks
Seven weeks in the desert
How do the Yaquis live
she asked
Belding could not reply to that but hope revived in him
He had faith in his wife though he could not in the least understand what he imagined was something mystic in her
Years ago when I was searching for my father I learned many things about this country said Mrs Belding
You can never tell how long a man may live in the desert
The fiercest most terrible and inaccessible places often have their hidden oasis
In his later years my father became a prospector
That was strange to me for he never cared for gold or money
I learned that he was often gone in the desert for weeks once for months
Then the time came when he never came back
That was years before I reached the southwest border and heard of him
Even then I did not for long give up hope of his coming back I know nowsomething tells meindeed it seems his spirit tells mehe was lost
But I dont have that feeling for Yaqui and his party
Yaqui has given Rojas the slip or has ambushed him in some trap
Probably that took time and a long journey into Sonora
The Indian is too wise to start back now over dry trails
Hell curb the rangers hell wait
I seem to know this dear Nell so be brave patient
Dick Gale will come back to you
Oh mother
cried Nell
I cant give up hope while I have you
That talk with the strong mother worked a change in Nell and Belding
Nell who had done little but brood and watch the west and take violent rides seemed to settle into a waiting patience that was sad yet serene
She helped her mother more than ever she was a comfort to Belding she began to take active interest in the affairs of the growing village
Belding who had been breaking under the strain of worry recovered himself so that to outward appearance he was his old self
He alone knew however that his humor was forced and that the slow burning wrath he felt for the Chases was flaming into hate
Belding argued with himself that if Ben Chase and his son Radford had turned out to be big men in other ways than in the power to carry on great enterprises he might have become reconciled to them
But the father was greedy grasping hard cold the son added to those traits an overbearing disposition to rule and he showed a fondness for drink and cards
These men were developing the valley to be sure and a horde of poor Mexicans and many Americans were benefiting from that development nevertheless these Chases were operating in a way which proved they cared only for themselves
Belding shook off a lethargic spell and decided he had better set about several by no means small tasks if he wanted to get them finished before the hot months
He made a trip to the Sonoyta Oasis
He satisfied himself that matters along the line were favorable and that there was absolutely no trace of his rangers
Upon completing this trip he went to Casita with a number of his white thoroughbreds and shipped them to ranchers and horsebreeders in Texas
Then being near the railroad and having time he went up to Tucson
There he learned some interesting particulars about the Chases
They had an office in the city influential friends in the Capitol
They were powerful men in the rapidly growing finance of the West
They had interested the Southern Pacific Railroad and in the near future a branch line was to be constructed from San Felipe to Forlorn River
These details of the Chase development were insignificant when compared to a matter striking close home to Belding
His responsibility had been subtly attacked
A doubt had been cast upon his capability of executing the duties of immigration inspector to the best advantage of the state
Belding divined that this was only an entering wedge
The Chases were bent upon driving him out of Forlorn River but perhaps to serve better their own ends they were proceeding at leisure
Belding returned home consumed by rage
But he controlled it
For the first time in his life he was afraid of himself
He had his wife and Nell to think of and the old law of the West had gone forever
Dad theres another Rojas round these diggings was Nells remark after the greetings were over and the usual questions and answers passed
Beldings exclamation was cut short by Nells laugh
She was serious with a kind of amused contempt
Mr Radford Chase
Now Nell what the roared Belding
Hush Dad
Dont swear interrupted Nell
I only meant to tease you
Humph
Say my girl that name Chase makes me see red
If you must tease me hit on some other way
Sabe senorita
Si si Dad
Nell you may as well tell him and have it over said Mrs Belding quietly
You promised me once Dad that youd not go packing a gun off down there didnt you
Yes I remember replied Belding but he did not answer her smile
Will you promise again
she asked lightly
Here was Nell with arch eyes yet not the old arch eyes so full of fun and mischief
Her lips were tremulous her cheeks seemed less round
Yes rejoined Belding and he knew why his voice was a little thick
Well if you werent such a good old blind Dad youd have seen long ago the way Mr Radford Chase ran round after me
At first it was only annoying and I did not want to add to your worries
But these two weeks youve been gone Ive been more than annoyed
After that time I struck Mr Chase with my quirt he made all possible efforts to meet me
He did meet me wherever I went
He sent me letters till I got tired of sending them back
When you left home on your trips I dont know that he grew bolder but he had more opportunity
I couldnt stay in the house all the time
There were mamas errands and sick people and my Sunday school and what not
Mr Chase waylaid me every time I went out
If he works any more I dont know when unless its when Im asleep
He followed me until it was less embarassing for me to let him walk with me and talk his head off
He made love to me
He begged me to marry him
I told him I was already in love and engaged to be married
He said that didnt make any difference
Then I called him a fool
Next time he saw me he said he must explain
He meant I was being true to a man who everybody on the border knew had been lost in the desert
Thatthat hurt
Maybemaybe its true
Sometimes it seems terribly true
Since then of course I have stayed in the house to avoid being hurt again
But Dad a little thing like a girl sticking close to her mother and room doesnt stop Mr Chase
I think hes crazy
Anyway hes a most persistent fool
I want to be charitable because the man swears he loves me and maybe he does but he is making me nervous
I dont sleep
Im afraid to be in my room at night
Ive gone to mothers room
Hes always hanging round
Bold
Why that isnt the thing to call Mr Chase
Hes absolutely without a sense of decency
He bribes our servants
He comes into our patio
Think of that
He makes the most ridiculous excuses
He bothers mother to death
I feel like a poor little rabbit holed by a hound
And I darent peep out
Somehow the thing struck Belding as funny and he laughed
He had not had a laugh for so long that it made him feel good
He stopped only at sight of Nells surprise and pain
Then he put his arms round her
Never mind dear
Im an old bear
But it tickled me I guess
I sure hope Mr Radford Chase has got it badNell its only the old story
The fellows fall in love with you
Its your good looks Nell
What a price women like you and Mercedes have to pay for beauty
Id a d a good deal rather be ugly as a mud fence
So would I Dad ifif Dick would still love me
He wouldnt you can gamble on that as Laddy says
Well the first time I catch this locoed Romeo sneaking round here IllIll Dad you promised
Confound it Nell I promised not to pack a gun
Thats all
Ill only shoo this fellow off the place gently mind you gently
Ill leave the rest for Dick Gale
Oh Dad
cried Nell and she clung to him wistful frightened yet something more
Dont mistake me Nell
You have your own way generally
You pull the wool over mothers eyes and you wind me round your little finger
But you cant do either with Dick Gale
Youre tenderhearted you overlook the doings of this hound Chase
But when Dick comes back you just make up your mind to a little hell in the Chase camp
Oh hell find it out
And I sure want to be round when Dick hands Mr Radford the same as he handed Rojas
Belding kept a sharp lookout for young Chase and then a few days later learned that both son and father had gone off upon one of their frequent trips to Casa Grandes near where their mines were situated
April grew apace and soon gave way to May
One morning Belding was called from some garden work by the whirring of an automobile and a Holla
He went forward to the front yard and there saw a car he thought resembled one he had seen in Casita
It contained a familiarlooking driver but the three figures in gray coats and veils were strange to him
By the time he had gotten to the road he decided two were women and the other a man
At the moment their faces were emerging from dusty veils
Belding saw an elderly sallowfaced rather frailappearing man who was an entire stranger to him a handsome darkeyed woman whose hair showed white through her veil and a superbly built girl whose face made Belding at once think of Dick Gale
Is this Mr Tom Belding inspector of immigration
inquired the gentleman courteously
Im Belding and I know who you are replied Belding in hearty amaze as he stretched forth his big hand
Youre Dick Gales Dadthe Governor Dick used to say
Im sure glad to meet you
Thank you
Yes Im Dicks governor and here Mr BeldingDicks mother and his sister Elsie
Beaming his pleasure Belding shook hands with the ladies who showed their agitation clearly
Mr Belding Ive come west to look up my lost son said Mr Gale
His sisters letters were unanswered
We havent heard from him in months
Is he still here with you
Well now sure Im awful sorry began Belding his slow mind at work
Dicks away just nowbeen away for a considerable spell
Im expecting him back any dayWont you come in
Youre all dusty and hot and tired
Come in and let mother and Nell make you comfortable
Of course youll stay
Weve a big house
You must stay till Dick comes back
Maybe that ll be Aw I guess it wont be longLet me handle the baggage Mr GaleCome in
I sure am glad to meet you all
Eager excited delighted Belding went on talking as he ushered the Gales into the sittingroom presenting them in his hearty way to the astounded Mrs Belding and Nell
For the space of a few moments his wife and daughter were bewildered
Belding did not recollect any other occasion when a few callers had thrown them off their balance
But of course this was different
He was a little flustered himselfa circumstance that dawned upon him with surprise
When the Gales had been shown to rooms Mrs Belding gained the poise momentarily lost but Nell came rushing back wilder than a deer in a state of excitement strange even for her
Oh
Dicks mother his sister
whispered Nell
Belding observed the omission of the father in Nells exclamation of mingled delight and alarm
His mother
went on Nell
Oh I knew it
I always guessed it
Dicks people are proud rich theyre somebody
I thought Id faint when she looked at me
She was just curiouscurious but so cold and proud
She was wondering about me
Im wearing his ring
It was his mothers he said
I wontI cant take it off
And Im scaredBut the sisteroh shes lovely and sweet proud too
I felt warm all over when she looked at me
II wanted to kiss her
She looks like Dick when he first came to us
But hes changed
Theyll hardly recognize himTo think theyve come
And I had to be looking a fright when of all times on earth Id want to look my best
Nell out of breath ran away evidently to make herself presentable according to her idea of the exigency of the case
Belding caught a glimpse of his wifes face as she went out and it wore a sad strange anxious expression
Then Belding sat alone pondering the contracting emotions of his wife and daughter
It was beyond his understanding
Women were creatures of feeling
Belding saw reason to be delighted to entertain Dicks family and for the time being no disturbing thought entered his mind
Presently the Gales came back into the sittingroom looking very different without the long gray cloaks and veils
Belding saw distinction and elegance
Mr Gale seemed a grave troubled kindly person ill in body and mind
Belding received the same impression of power that Ben Chase had given him only here it was minus any harshness or hard quality
He gathered that Mr Gale was a man of authority
Mrs Gale rather frightened Belding but he could not have told why
The girl was just like Dick as he used to be
Their manner of speaking also reminded Belding of Dick
They talked of the ride from Ash Fork down to the border of the ugly and tornup Casita of the heat and dust and cactus along the trail
Presently Nell came in now cool and sweet in white with a red rose at her breast
Belding had never been so proud of her
He saw that she meant to appear well in the eyes of Dicks people and began to have a faint perception of what the ordeal was for her
Belding imagined the sooner the Gales were told that Dick was to marry Nell the better for all concerned and especially for Nell
In the general conversation that ensued he sought for an opening in which to tell this important news but he was kept so busy answering questions about his position on the border the kind of place Forlorn River was the reason for so many tents etc that he was unable to find opportunity
Its very interesting very interesting said Mr Gale
At another time I want to learn all youll tell me about the West
Its new to me
Im surprised amazed sir I may sayBut Mr Belding what I want to know most is about my son
Im broken in health
Ive worried myself ill over him
I dont mind telling you sir that we quarreled
I laughed at his threats
He went away
And Ive come to see that I didnt know Richard
I was wrong to upbraid him
For a year weve known nothing of his doings and now for almost six months weve not heard from him at all
Frankly Mr Belding I weakened first and Ive come to hunt him up
My fear is that I didnt start soon enough
The boy will have a great position some dayGod knows perhaps soon
I should not have allowed him to run over this wild country for so long
But I hoped though I hardly believed that he might find himself
Now Im afraid hes Mr Gale paused and the white hand he raised expressively shook a little
Belding was not so thickwitted where men were concerned
He saw how the matter lay between Dick Gale and his father
Well Mr Gale sure most young bucks from the East go to the bad out here he said bluntly
Ive been told that replied Mr Gale and a shade overspread his worn face
They blow their money then go punching cows take to whiskey
Yes rejoined Mr Gale feebly nodding
Then they get to gambling lose their jobs went on Belding
Mr Gale lifted haggard eyes
Then its bumming around regular tramps and to the bad generally
Belding spread wide his big arms and when one of them dropped round Nell who sat beside him she squeezed his hand tight
Sure its the regular thing he concluded cheerfully
He rather felt a little glee at Mr Gales distress and Mrs Gales crushed Itoldyouso woe in no wise bothered him but the look in the big dark eyes of Dicks sister was too much for Belding
He choked off his characteristic oath when excited and blurted out Say but Dick Gale never went to the badListen
Belding had scarcely started Dick Gales story when he perceived that never in his life had he such an absorbed and breathless audience
Presently they were awed and at the conclusion of that story they sat whitefaced still amazed beyond speech
Dick Gales advent in Casita his rescue of Mercedes his life as a border ranger certainly lost no picturesque or daring or even noble detail in Beldings telling
He kept back nothing but the present doubt of Dicks safety
Dicks sister was the first of the three to recover herself
Oh father
she cried and there was a glorious light in her eyes
Deep down in my heart I knew Dick was a man
Mr Gale rose unsteadily from his chair
His frailty was now painfully manifest
Mr Belding do you mean my sonRichard Galehas done all that you told us
he asked incredulously
I sure do replied Belding with hearty good will
Martha do you hear
Mr Gale turned to question his wife
She could not answer
Her face had not yet regained its natural color
He faced that bandit and his gang alonehe fought them
demanded Mr Gale his voice stronger
Dick mopped up the floor with the whole outfit
He rescued a Spanish girl went into the desert without food weapons anything but his hands
Richard Gale whose hands were always useless
Belding nodded with a grin
Hes a ranger nowriding fighting sleeping on the sand preparing his own food
Well I should smile rejoined Belding
He cares for his horse with his own hands
This query seemed to be the climax of Mr Gales strange hunger for truth
He had raised his head a little higher and his eye was brighter
Mention of a horse fired Beldings blood
Does Dick Gale care for his horse
Say there are not many men as well loved as that white horse of Dicks
Blanco Sol he is Mr Gale
Thats Mex for White Sun
Wait till you see Blanco Sol
Bar one the whitest biggest strongest fastest grandest horse in the Southwest
So he loves a horse
I shall not know my own sonMr Belding you say Richard works for you
May I ask at what salary
He gets forty dollars board and outfit replied Belding proudly
Forty dollars
echoed the father
By the day or week
The month of course said Belding somewhat taken aback
Forty dollars a month for a young man who spent five hundred in the same time when he was at college and who ran it into thousands when he got out
Mr Gale laughed for the first time and it was the laugh of a man who wanted to believe what he heard yet scarcely dared to do it
What does he do with so much moneymoney earned by peril toil sweat and blood
Forty dollars a month
He saves it replied Belding
Evidently this was too much for Dick Gales father and he gazed at his wife in sheer speechless astonishment
Dicks sister clapped her hands like a little child
Belding saw that the moment was propitious
Sure he saves it
Dicks engaged to marry Nell here
My stepdaughter Nell Burton
Ohh Dad
faltered Nell and she rose white as her dress
How strange it was to see Dicks mother and sister rise also and turn to Nell with dark proud searching eyes
Belding vaguely realized some blunder he had made
Nells white appealing face gave him a pang
What had he done
Surely this family of Dicks ought to know his relation to Nell
There was a silence that positively made Belding nervous
Then Elsie Gale stepped close to Nell
Miss Burton are you really Richards betrothed
Nells tremulous lips framed an affirmative but never uttered it
She held out her hand showing the ring Dick had given her
Miss Gales recognition was instant and her response was warm sweet gracious
I think I am going to be very very glad she said and kissed Nell
Miss Burton we are learning wonderful things about Richard added Mr Gale in an earnest though shaken voice
If you have had to do with making a man of himand now I begin to see to believe somay God bless youMy dear girl I have not really looked at you
Richards fianceeMother we have not found him yet but I think weve found his secret
We believed him a lost son
But here is his sweetheart
It was only then that the pride and hauteur of Mrs Gales face broke into an expression of mingled pain and joy
She opened her arms
Nell uttering a strange little stifled cry flew into them
Belding suddenly discovered an unaccountable blur in his sight
He could not see perfectly and that was why when Mrs Belding entered the sittingroom he was not certain that her face was as sad and white as it seemed
XV Bound In The Desert Far away from Forlorn River Dick Gale sat stunned gazing down into the purple depths where Rojas had plunged to his death
The Yaqui stood motionless upon the steep red wall of lava from which he had cut the bandits hold
Mercedes lay quietly where she had fallen
From across the depths there came to Gales ear the Indians strange wild cry
Then silence hollow breathless stony silence enveloped the great abyss and its upheaved lava walls
The sun was setting
Every instant the haze reddened and thickened
Action on the part of the Yaqui loosened the spell which held Gale as motionless as his surroundings
The Indian was edging back toward the ledge
He did not move with his former lithe and sure freedom
He crawled slipped dragged himself rested often and went on again
He had been wounded
When at last he reached the ledge where Mercedes lay Gale jumped to his feet strong and thrilling spurred to meet the responsibility that now rested upon him
Swiftly he turned to where Thorne lay
The cavalryman was just returning to consciousness
Gale ran for a canteen bathed his face made him drink
The look in Thornes eyes was hard to bear
Thorne
Thorne
its all right its all right
cried Gale in piercing tones
Mercedes is safe
Yaqui saved her
Rojas is done for
Yaqui jumped down the wall and drove the bandit off the ledge
Cut him loose from the wall foot by foot hand by hand
Weve won the fight Thorne
For Thorne these were marvelous strength  giving words
The dark horror left his eyes and they began to dilate to shine
He stood up dizzily but unaided and he gazed across the crater
Yaqui had reached the side of Mercedes was bending over her
She stirred
Yaqui lifted her to her feet
She appeared weak unable to stand alone
But she faced across the crater and waved her hand
She was unharmed
Thorne lifted both arms above head and from his lips issued a cry
It was neither call nor holloa nor welcome nor answer
Like the Yaquis it could scarcely be named
But it was deep husky prolonged terribly human in its intensity
It made Gale shudder and made his heart beat like a trip hammer
Mercedes again waved a white hand
The Yaqui waved too and Gale saw in the action an urgent signal
Hastily taking up canteen and rifles Gale put a supporting arm around Thorne
Come old man
Can you walk
Sure you can walk
Lean on me and well soon get out of this
Dont look across
Look where you step
Weve not much time before dark
Oh Thorne Im afraid Jim has cashed in
And the last I saw of Laddy he was badly hurt
Gale was keyed up to a high pitch of excitement and alertness
He seemed to be able to do many things
But once off the ragged notched lava into the trail he had not such difficulty with Thorne and could keep his keen gaze shifting everywhere for sight of enemies
Listen Thorne
Whats that
asked Gale halting as they came to a place where the trail led down through rough breaks in the lava
The silence was broken by a strange sound almost unbelieveable considering the time and place
A voice was droning Turn the lady turn
Turn the lady turn
Alamon left
All swing turn the lady turn
Hello Jim called Gale dragging Thorne round the corner of lava
Where are you
Oh you son of a gun
I thought you were dead
Oh Im glad to see you
Jim are you hurt
Jim Lash stood in the trail leaning over the butt of his rifle which evidently he was utilizing as a crutch
He was pale but smiling
His hands were bloody
A scarf had been bound tightly round his left leg just above the knee
The leg hung limp and the foot dragged
I reckon I aint injured much replied Him
But my leg hurts like hell if you want to know
Laddy
Oh wheres Laddy
Hes just across the crack there
I was trying to get to him
We had it hot an heavy down here
Laddy was pretty bad shot up before he tried to head Rojas off the trailDick did you see the Yaqui go after Rojas
Did I
exclaimed Gale grimly
The finish was all that saved me from runnin loco plumb over the rim
You see I was closern you to where Mercedes was hid
When Rojas an his last Greaser started across Laddy went after them but I couldnt
Laddy did for Rojass man then went down himself
But he got up an fell got up went on an fell again
Laddy kept doin that till he dropped for good
I reckon our chances are against findin him aliveI tell you boys Rojas was hellbent
An Mercedes was game
I saw her shoot him
But mebbe bullets couldnt stop him then
If I didnt sweat blood when Mercedes was fightin him on the cliff
Then the finish
Only a Yaqui could have done thatThorne you didnt miss it
Yes I was down and out replied the cavalryman
Its a shame
Greatest stunt I ever seen
Thorne youre standin up pretty fair
How about you
Dick is he bad hurt
No hes not
A hard knock on the skull and a scalp wound  replied Dick
Here Jim let me help you over this place
Step by step Gale got the two injured men down the uneven declivity and then across the narrow lava bridge over the fissure
Here he bade them rest while he went along the trail on that side to search for Laddy
Gale found the ranger stretched out face downward a reddened hand clutching a gun
Gale thought he was dead
Upon examination however it was found that Ladd still lived though he had many wounds
Gale lifted him and carried him back to the others
Hes alive but thats all said Dick as he laid the ranger down
Do what you can
Stop the blood
Laddys tough as cactus you know
Ill hurry back for Mercedes and Yaqui
Gale like a fleet surefooted mountain sheep ran along the trail
When he came across the Mexican Rojass last ally Gale had evidence of the terrible execution of the 405
He did not pause
On the first part of that descent he made faster time than had Rojas
But he exercised care along the hard slippery ragged slope leading to the ledge
Presently he came upon Mercedes and the Yaqui
She ran right into Dicks arms and there her strength if not her courage broke and she grew lax
Mercedes youre safe
Thornes safe
Its all right now
Rojas
she whispered
Gone
To the bottom of the crater
A Yaquis vengeance Mercedes
He heard the girl whisper the name of the Virgin
Then he gathered her up in his arms
Come Yaqui
The Indian grunted
He had one hand pressed close over a bloody place in his shoulder
Gale looked keenly at him
Yaqui was inscrutable as of old yet Gale somehow knew that wound meant little to him
The Indian followed him
Without pausing moving slowly in some places very carefully in others and swiftly on the smooth part of the trail Gale carried Mercedes up to the rim and along to the the others
Jim Lash worked awkardly over Ladd
Thorne was trying to assist
Ladd himself was conscious but he was a pallid apparently a deathstricken man
The greeting between Mercedes and Thorne was calmstrangely so it seemed to Gale
But he was calm himself
Ladd smiled at him and evidently would have spoken had he the power
Yaqui then joined the group and his piercing eyes roved from one to the other lingering longest over Ladd
Dick Im figgern hard said Jim faintly
In a minute it ll be up to you an Mercedes
Ive about shot my boltReckon youll do best by bringin up blanketswatersaltfirewood
Laddys gotone chancein a hundred
Fix him upfirst
Use hot salt water
If my legs brokeset it best you can
That hole in Yaquionly ll bother him a day
Thornes bad hurtNow rustleDick oldboy
Lashs voice died away in a husky whisper and he quietly lay back stretching out all but the crippled leg
Gale examined it assured himself the bones had not been broken and then rose ready to go down the trail
Mercedes hold Thornes head up in your lapso
Now Ill go
On the moment Yaqui appeared to have completed the binding of his wounded shoulder and he started to follow Gale
He paid no attention to Gales order for him to stay back
But he was slow and gradually Gale forged ahead
The lingering brightness of the sunset lightened the trail and the descent to the arroyo was swift and easy
Some of the white horses had come in for water
Blanco Sol spied Gale and whistled and came pounding toward him
It was twilight down in the arroyo
Yaqui appeared and began collecting a bundle of mesquite sticks
Gale hastily put together the things he needed and packing them all in a tarpaulin he turned to retrace his steps up the trail
Darkness was setting in
The trail was narrow exceedingly steep and in some places fronted on precipices
Gales burden was not very heavy but its bulk made it unwieldy and it was always overbalancing him or knocking against the wall side of the trail
Gale found it necessary to wait for Yaqui to take the lead
The Indians eyes must have seen as well at night as by day
Gale toiled upward shouldering swinging dragging the big pack and though the ascent of the slope was not really long it seemed endless
At last they reached a level and were soon on the spot with Mercedes and the injured men
Gale then set to work
Yaquis part was to keep the fire blazing and the water hot Mercedess to help Gale in what way she could
Gale found Ladd had many wounds yet not one of them was directly in a vital place
Evidently the ranger had almost bled to death
He remained unconcious through Gales operations
According to Jim Lash Ladd had one chance in a hundred but Gale considered it one in a thousand
Having done all that was possible for the ranger Gale slipped blankets under and around him and then turned his attention to Lash
Jim came out of his stupor
A mushrooming bullet had torn a great hole in his leg
Gale upon examination could not be sure the bones had been missed but there was no bad break
The application of hot salt water made Jim groan
When he had been bandaged and laid beside Ladd Gale went on to the cavalryman
Thorne was very weak and scarcely conscious
A furrow had been plowed through his scalp down to the bone
When it had been dressed Mercedes collapsed
Gale laid her with the three in a row and covered them with blankets and the tarpaulin
Then Yaqui submitted to examination
A bullet had gone through the Indians shoulder
To Gale it appeared serious
Yaqui said it was a flea bite
But he allowed Gale to bandage it and obeyed when he was told to lie quiet in his blanket beside the fire
Gale stood guard
He seemed still calm and wondered at what he considered a strange absence of poignant feeling
If he had felt weariness it was now gone
He coaxed the fire with as little wood as would keep it burning he sat beside it he walked to and fro close by sometimes he stood over the five sleepers wondering if two of them at least would ever awaken
Time had passed swiftly but as the necessity for immediate action had gone by the hours gradually assumed something of their normal length
The night wore on
The air grew colder the stars brighter the sky bluer and if such could be possible the silence more intense
The fire burned out and for lack of wood could not be rekindled
Gale patrolled his short beat becoming colder and damper as dawn approached
The darkness grew so dense that he could not see the pale faces of the sleepers
He dreaded the gray dawn and the light
Slowly the heavy black belt close to the lava changed to a pale gloom then to gray and after that morning came quickly
The hour had come for Dick Gale to face his great problem
It was natural that he hung back a little at first natural that when he went forward to look at the quiet sleepers he did so with a grim and stern force urging him
Yaqui stirred roused yawned got up and though he did not smile at Gale a light shone swiftly across his dark face
His shoulder drooped and appeared stiff otherwise he was himself
Mercedes lay in deep slumber
Thorne had a high fever and was beginning to show signs of restlessness
Ladd seemed just barely alive
Jim Lash slept as if he was not much the worse for his wound
Gale rose from his examination with a sharp breaking of his cold mood
While there was life in Thorne and Ladd there was hope for them
Then he faced his problem and his decision was instant
He awoke Mercedes
How wondering wistful beautiful was that first opening flash of her eyes
Then the dark troubled thought came
Swiftly she sat up
Mercedescome
Are you all right
Laddy is alive Thornes not not so bad
But weve got a job on our hands
You must help me
She bent over Thorne and laid her hands on his hot face
Then she rosea woman such as he had imagined she might be in an hour of trial
Gale took up Ladd as carefully and gently as possible
Mercedes bring what you can carry and follow me he said
Then motioning for Yaqui to remain there he turned down the slope with Ladd in his arms
Neither pausing nor making a misstep nor conscious of great effort Gale carried the wounded man down into the arroyo
Mercedes kept at his heels light supple lithe as a panther
He left her with Ladd and went back
When he had started off with Thorne in his arms he felt the tax on his strength
Surely and swiftly however he bore the cavalryman down the trail to lay him beside Ladd
Again he started back and when he began to mount the steep lava steps he was hot wet breathing hard
As he reached the scene of that nights camp a voice greeted him
Jim Lash was sitting up
Hello Dick
I woke some late this mornin
Wheres Laddy
Dick you aint agoin to say Laddys alivethats about all replied Dick
Wheres Thorne an Mercedes
Look here man
I reckon you aint packin this crippled outfit down that awful trail
Had to Jim
An hours sunwould killboth Laddy and Thorne
Come on now
For once Jim Lashs cool good nature and careless indifference gave precedence to amaze and concern
Always knew you was a husky chap
But Dick youre no hoss
Get me a crutch an give me a lift on one side
Come on replied Gale
Ive no time to monkey
He lifted the ranger called to Yaqui to follow with some of the camp outfit and once more essayed the steep descent
Jim Lash was the heaviest man of the three and Gales strength was put to enormous strain to carry him on that broken trail
Nevertheless Gale went down down walking swiftly and surely over the bad places and at last he staggered into the arroyo with bursting heart and redblinded eyes
When he had recovered he made a final trip up the slope for the camp effects which Yaqui had been unable to carry
Then he drew Jim and Mercedes and Yaqui also into an earnest discussion of ways and means whereby to fight for the life of Thorne
Ladds case Gale now considered hopeless though he meant to fight for him too as long as he breathed
In the labor of watching and nursing it seemed to Gale that two days and two nights slipped by like a few hours
During that time the Indian recovered from his injury and became capable of performing all except heavy tasks
Then Gale succumbed to weariness
After his muchneeded rest he relieved Mercedes of the care and watch over Thorne which up to that time she had absolutely refused to relinquish
The cavalryman had high fever and Gale feared he had developed blood poisoning
He required constant attention
His condition slowly grew worse and there came a day which Gale thought surely was the end
But that day passed and the night and the next day and Thorne lived on ghastly stricken raving
Mercedes hung over him with jealous passionate care and did all that could have been humanly done for a man
She grew wan absorbed silent
But suddenly and to Gales amaze and thanksgiving there came an abatement of Thornes fever
With it some of the heat and redness of the inflamed wound disappeared
Next morning he was conscious and Gale grasped some of the hope that Mercedes had never abandoned
He forced her to rest while he attended to Thorne
That day he saw that the crisis was past
Recovery for Thorne was now possible and would perhaps depend entirely upon the care he received
Jim Lashs wound healed without any aggravating symptoms
It would be only a matter of time unti he had the use of his leg again
All these days however there was little apparent change in Ladds condition unless it was that he seemed to fade away as he lingered
At first his wounds remained open they bled a little all the time outwardly perhaps internally also the blood did not seem to clot and so the bullet holes did not close
Then Yaqui asked for the care of Ladd
Gale yielded it with opposing thoughtsthat Ladd would waste slowly away till life ceased and that there never was any telling what might lie in the power of this strange Indian
Yaqui absented himself from camp for a while and when he returned he carried the roots and leaves of desert plants unknown to Gale
From these the Indian brewed an ointment
Then he stripped the bandages from Ladd and applied the mixture to his wounds
That done he let him lie with the wounds exposed to the air at night covering him
Next day he again exposed the wounds to the warm dry air
Slowly they closed and Ladd ceased to bleed externally
Days passed and grew into what Gale imagined must have been weeks
Yaqui recovered fully
Jim Lash began to move about on a crutch he shared the Indians watch over Ladd
Thorne lay haggard emaciated ghost of his rugged self but with life in the eyes that turned always toward Mercedes
Ladd lingered and lingered
The life seemingly would not leave his bulletpierced body
He faded withered shrunk till he was almost a skeleton
He knew those who worked and watched over him but he had no power of speech
His eyes and eyelids moved the rest of him seemed stone
All those days nothing except water was given him
It was marvelous how tenaciously however feebly he clung to life
Gale imagined it was the Yaquis spirit that held back death
That tireless implacable inscrutable savage was ever at the rangers side
His great somber eyes burned
At length he went to Gale and with that strange light flitting across the hard bronzed face he said Ladd would live
The second day after Ladd had been given such thin nourishment as he could swallow he recovered the use of his tongue
Shorethisshell he whispered
That was a characteristic speech for the ranger Gale thought and indeed it made all who heard it smile while their eyes were wet
From that time forward Ladd gained but he gained so immeasurably slowly that only the eyes of hope could have seen any improvement
Jim Lash threw away his crutch and Thorne was well if still somewhat weak before Ladd could lift his arm or turn his head
A kind of long immovable gloom passed like a shadow from his face
His whispers grew stronger
And the day arrived when Gale who was perhaps the least optimistic threw doubt to the winds and knew the ranger would get well
For Gale that joyous moment of realization was one in which he seemed to return to a former self long absent
He experienced an elevation of soul
He was suddenly overwhelmed with gratefulness humility awe
A gloomy black terror had passed by
He wanted to thank the faithful Mercedes and Thorne for getting well and the cheerful Lash and Ladd himself and that strange and wonderful Yaqui now such a splendid figure
He thought of home and Nell
The terrible encompassing red slopes lost something of their fearsomeness and there was a good spirit hovering near
Boys come round called Ladd in his low voice
An you Mercedes
An call the Yaqui
Ladd lay in the shade of the brush shelter that had been erected
His head was raised slightly on a pillow
There seemed little of him but long lean lines and if it had not been for his keen thoughtful kindly eyes his face would have resembled a death mask of a man starved
Shore I want to know what day is it an what month
asked Ladd
Nobody could answer him
The question seemed a surprise to Gale and evidently was so to the others
Look at that cactus went on Ladd
Near the wall of lava a stunted saguaro lifted its head
A few shriveled blossoms that had once been white hung along the fluted column
I reckon according to that giant cactus its somewheres along the end of March said Jim Lash soberly
Shore its April
Look where the sun is
An cant you feel its gettin hot
Supposin it is April
queried Lash slowly
Well what Im drivin at is its about time you all was hittin the trail back to Forlorn River before the waterholes dry out
Laddy I reckon well start soon as youre able to be put on a hoss
Shore that ll be too late
A silence ensued in which those who heard Ladd gazed fixedly at him and then at one another
Lash uneasily shifted the position of his lame leg and Gale saw him moisten his lips with his tongue
Charlie Ladd I aint reckonin you mean were to ride off an leave you here
What else is there to do
The hot weathers close
Pretty soon most of the waterholes will be dry
You cant travel thenIm on my back here an God only knows when I could be packed out
Not for weeks mebbe
Ill never be any good again even if I was to get out aliveYou see shore this sort of case comes round sometimes in the desert
Its common enough
Ive heard of several cases where men had to go an leave a feller behind
Its reasonable
If youre fightin the desert you cant afford to be sentimental Now as I said Im all in
So whats the sense of you waitin here when it means the old desert story
By goin now mebbe youll get home
If you wait on a chance of takin me youll be too late
Pretty soon this lava ll be one roastin hell
Shore now boys youll see this the right way
Jim old pard
No Laddy an I cant figger how you could ever ask me
Shore then leave me here with Yaqui an a could of the hosses
We can eat sheep meat
An if the water holds out No
interrupted Lash violently
Ladds eyes sought Gales face
Son you aint bullheaded like Jim
Youll see the sense of it
Theres Nell awaitin back at Forlorn River
Think what it means to her
Shes a damn fine girl Dick an what right have you to break her heart for an old wornout cowpuncher
Think how shes watchin for you with that sweet face all sad an troubled an her eyes turnin black
Youll go son wont you
Dick shook his head
The ranger turned his gaze upon Thorne and now the keen glistening light in his gray eyes had blurred
Thorne its different with you
Jims a fool an young Gale has been punctured by choya thorns
Hes got the desert poison in his blood
But you nowyouve no call to stickyou can find that trail out
Its easy to follow made by so many shod hosses
Take your wife an goShore youll go Thorne
Deliberately and without an instants hesitation the calvaryman replied No
Ladd then directed his appeal to Mercedes
His face was now convulsed and his voice though it had sunk to a whisper was clear and beautiful with some rich quality that Gale had never heard in it
Mercedes youre a woman
Youre the woman we fought for
An some of us are shore goin to die for you
Dont make it all for nothin
Let us feel we saved the woman
Shore you can make Thorne go
Hell have to go if you say
Theyll all have to go
Think of the years of love an happiness in store for you
A week or so an it ll be too late
Can you stand for me seein youLet me tell you Mercedes when the summer heat hits the lava well all wither an curl up like shavins near a fire
A wind of hell will blow up this slope
Look at them mesquites
See the twist in them
Thats the torture of heat an thirst
Do you want me or all us men seeinyou like thatMercedes dont make it all for nothin
Say youll persuade Thorne if not the others
For all the effect his appeal had to move her Mercedes might have possessed a heart as hard and fixed as the surrounding lava
Never
Whitefaced with great black eyes flashing the Spanish girl spoke the word that bound her and her companions in the desert
The subject was never mentioned again
Gale thought that he read a sinister purpose in Ladds mind
To his astonishment Lash came to him with the same fancy
After that they made certain there never was a gun within reach of Ladds clutching clawlike hands
Gradually a somber spell lifted from the rangers mind
When he was entirely free of it he began to gather strength daily
Then it was as if he had never known patiencehe who had shown so well how to wait
He was in a frenzy to get well
He appetite could not be satisfied
The sun climbed higher whiter hotter
At midday a wind from gulfward roared up the arroyo and now only palos verdes and the few saguaros were green
Every day the water in the lava hole sank an inch
The Yaqui alone spent the waiting time in activity
He made trips up on the lava slope and each time he returned with guns or boots or sombreros or something belonging to the bandits that had fallen
He never fetched in a saddle or bridle and from that the rangers concluded Rojass horses had long before taken their back trail
What speculation what consternation those saddled horses would cause if they returned to Forlorn River
As Ladd improved there was one story he had to hear every day
It was the one relating to what he had missedthe sight of Rojas pursued and plunged to his doom
The thing had a morbid fascination for the sick ranger
He reveled in it
He tortured Mercedes
His gentleness and consideration heretofore so marked were in abeyance to some sinister ghastly joy
But to humor him Mercedes racked her soul with the sensations she had sufferd when Rojas hounded her out on the ledge when she shot him when she sprang to throw herself over the precipice when she fought him when with halfblinded eyes she looked up to see the merciless Yaqui reaching for the bandit
Ladd fed his cruel longing with Thornes poignant recollections with the keen clear nevertobeforgotten shocks to Gales eye and ear
Jim Lash for one at least never tired of telling how he had seen and heard the tragedy and every time in the telling it gathered some more tragic and gruesome detail
Jim believed in satiating the ranger
Then in the twilight when the campfire burned Ladd would try to get the Yaqui to tell his side of the story
But this the Indian would never do
There was only the expression of his fathomless eyes and the set passion of his massive face
Those waiting days grew into weeks
Ladd gained very slowly
Nevertheless at last he could walk about and soon he averred that strapped to a horse he could last out the trip to Forlorn River
There was rejoicing in camp and plans were eagerly suggested
The Yaqui happened to be absent
When he returned the rangers told him they were now ready to undertake the journey back across lava and cactus
Yaqui shook his head
They declared again their intention
No
replied the Indian and his deep sonorous voice rolled out upon the quiet of the arroyo
He spoke briefly then
They had waited too long
The smaller waterholes back in the trail were dry
The hot summer was upon them
There could be only death waiting down in the burning valley
Here was water and grass and wood and shade from the suns rays and sheep to be killed on the peaks
The water would hold unless the season was that dreaded ano seco of the Mexicans
Wait for rain concluded Yaqui and now as never before he spoke as one with authority
If no rain Silently he lifted his hand
XVI Mountain Sheep What Gale might have thought an appalling situation if considered from a safe and comfortable home away from the desert became now that he was shut in by the redribbed lava walls and great dry wastes a matter calmly accepted as inevitable
So he imagined it was accepted by the others
Not even Mercedes uttered a regret
No word was spoken of home
If there was thought of loved one it was locked deep in their minds
In Mercedes there was no change in womanly quality perhaps because all she had to love was there in the desert with her
Gale had often pondered over this singular change in character
He had trained himself in order to fight a paralyzing something in the deserts influence to oppose with memory and thought an insidious primitive retrogression to what was scarcely consciousness at all merely a savages instinct of sight and sound
He felt the need now of redoubled effort
For there was a sheer happiness in drifting
Not only was it easy to forget it was hard to remember
His idea was that a man laboring under a great wrong a great crime a great passion might find the lonely desert a fitting place for either remembrance or oblivion according to the nature of his soul
But an ordinary healthy reasonably happy mortal who loved the open with its blaze of sun and sweep of wind would have a task to keep from going backward to the natural man as he was before civilization
By tacit agreement Ladd again became the leader of the party
Ladd was a man who would have taken all the responsibility whether or not it was given him
In moments of hazard of uncertainty Lash and Gale even Belding unconsciously looked to the ranger
He had that kind of power
The first thing Ladd asked was to have the store of food that remained spread out upon a tarpaulin
Assuredly it was a slender enough supply
The ranger stood for long moments gazing down at it
He was groping among past experiences calling back from his years of life on range and desert that which might be valuable for the present issue
It was impossible to read the gravity of Ladds face for he still looked like a dead man but the slow shake of his head told Gale much
There was a grain of hope however in the significance with which he touched the bags of salt and said Shore it was sense packin all that salt
Then he turned to face his comrades
Thats little grub for six starvin people corralled in the desert
But the grub end aint worryin me
Yaqui can get sheep up the slopes
Water
Thats the beginnin and middle an end of our case
Laddy I reckon the waterhole here never goes dry replied Jim
Ask the Indian
Upon being questioned Yaqui repeated what he had said about the dreaded ano seco of the Mexicans
In a dry year this waterhole failed
Dick take a rope an see how much waters in the hole
Gale could not find bottom with a thirty foot lasso
The water was as cool clear sweet as if it had been kept in a shaded iron receptable
Ladd welcomed this information with surprise and gladness
Lets see
Last year was shore pretty dry
Mebbe this summer wont be
Mebbe our wonderful good luckll hld
Ask Yaqui if he thinks it ll rain
Mercedes questioned the Indian
He says no man can tell surely
But he thinks the rain will come she replied
Shore it ll rain you can gamble on that now continued Ladd
If theres only grass for the hosses
We cant get out of here without hosses
Dick take the Indian an scout down the arroyo
Today I seen the hosses were gettin fat
Gettin fat in this desert
But mebbe theyve about grazed up all the grass
Go an see Dick
An may you come back with more good news
Gale upon the few occasions when he had wandered down the arroyo had never gone far
The Yaqui said there was grass for the horses and until now no one had given the question more consideration
Gale found that the arroyo widened as it opened
Near the head where it was narrow the grass lined the course of the dry stream bed
But farther down this stream bed spread out
There was every indication that at flood seasons the water covered the floor of the arroyo
The farther Gale went the thicker and larger grew the gnarled mesquites and palo verdes the more cactus and greasewood there were and other desert growths
Patches of gray grass grew everywhere
Gale began to wonder where the horses were
Finally the trees and brush thinned out and a milewide gray plain stretched down to reddish sand dunes
Over to one side were the white horses and even as Gale saw them both Blanco Diablo and Sol lifted their heads and with white manes tossing in the wind whistled clarion calls
Here was grass enough for many horses the arroyo was indeed an oasis
Ladd and the others were awaiting Gales report and they received it with calmness yet with a joy no less evident because it was restrained
Gale in his keen observation at the moment found that he and his comrades turned with glad eyes to the woman of the party
Senor Laddy you thinkyou believewe shall she faltered and her voice failed
It was the woman in her weakening in the light of real hope of the happiness now possible beyond that desert barrier
Mercedes no white man can tell whatll come to pass out here said Ladd earnestly
Shore I have hopes now I never dreamed of
I was pretty near a dead man
The Indian saved me
Queer notions have come into my head about Yaqui
I dont understand them
He seems when you look at him only a squalid sullen vengeful savage
But Lord
thats far from the truth
Mebbe Yaquis different from most Indians
He looks the same though
Mebbe the trouble is we white folks never knew the Indian
Anyway Beldin had it right
Yaquis our godsend
Now as to the future Id like to know mebbe as well as you if were ever to get home
Only bein what I am I say Quien sabe
But somethin tells me Yaqui knows
Ask him Mercedes
Make him tell
Well all be the better for knowin
Wed be stronger for havin moren our faith in him
Hes silent Indian but make him tell
Mercedes called to Yaqui
At her bidding there was always a suggestion of hurry which otherwise was never manifest in his actions
She put a hand on his bared muscular arm and began to speak in Spanish
Her voice was low swift full of deep emotion sweet as the sound of a bell
It thrilled Gale though he understood scarcely a word she said
He did not need translation to know that here spoke the longing of a woman for life love home the heritage of a womans heart
Gale doubted his own divining impression
It was that the Yaqui understood this womans longing
In Gales sight the Indians stoicism his inscrutability the lavalike hardness of his face although they did not change seemed to give forth light gentleness loyalty
For an instant Gale seemed to have a vision but it did not last and he failed to hold some beautiful illusive thing
Si
rolled out the Indians reply full of power and depth
Mercedes drew a long breath and her hand sought Thornes
He says yes she whispered
He answers hell save us hell take us all backhe knows
The Indian turned away to his tasks and the silence that held the little group was finally broken by Ladd
Shore I said so
Now all weve got to do is use sense
Friends Im the commissary department of this outfit an what I say goes
You all wont eat except when I tell you
Mebbe itll not be so hard to keep our health
Starved beggars dont get sick
But theres the heat comin an we can all go loco you know
To pass the time
Lord thats our problem
Now if you all only had a hankerin for checkers
Shore Ill make a board an make you play
Thorne youre the luckiest
Youve got your girl an this can be a honeymoon
Now with a few tools an little material see what a grand house you can build for your wife
Dick youre luckytoo
You like to hunt an up there youll find the finest bighorn huntin in the West
Take Yaqui and the 405
We need the meat but while youre gettin it have your sport
The same chance will never come again
I wish we all was able to go
But crippled men cant climb the lava
Shore youll see some country from the peaks
Theres no wilder place on earth except the poles
An when youre older you an Nell with a couple of fine boys think what itll be to tell them about bein lost in the lava an huntin sheep with a Yaqui
Shore Ive hit it
You can take yours out in huntin an thinkin
Now if I had a girl like Nell Id never go crazy
Thats your game Dick
Hunt an think of Nell an how youll tell those fine boys about it all an about the old cowman you knowed Laddy wholl by then be long past the divide
Rustle now son
Get some enthusiasm
For shore youll need it for yourself an us
Gale climbed the lava slope away round to the right of the arroyo along an old trail that Yaqui said the Papagos had made before his own people had hunted there
Part way it led through spiked crested upheaved lava that would have been almost impassable even without its silver coating of choya cactus
There were benches and ledges and ridges bare and glistening in the sun
From the crests of these Yaquis searching falcon gaze roved near and far for signs of sheep and Gale used his glass on the reaches of lava that slanted steeply upward to the corrugated peaks and down over endless heave and roll and redwaved slopes
The heat smoked up from the lava and this with the red color and the shiny choyas gave the impression of a world of smoldering fire
Farther along the slope Yaqui halted and crawled behind projections to a point commanding a view over an extraordinary section of country
The peaks were off to the left
In the foreground were gullies ridges and canyons arroyos all glistening with choyas and some other and more numerous white bushes and here and there towered a green cactus
This region was only a splintered and more devastated part of the volcanic slope but it was miles in extent
Yaqui peeped over the top of a blunt block of lava and searched the sharpbillowed wilderness
Suddenly he grasped Gale and pointed across a deep wide gully
With the aid of his glass Gale saw five sheep
They were much larger than he had expected dull brown in color and two of them were rams with great curved horns
They were looking in his direction
Remembering what he had heard about the wonderful eyesight of these mountain animals Gale could only conclude that they had seen the hunters
Then Yaquis movements attracted and interested him
The Indian had brought with him a red scarf and a mesquite branch
He tied the scarf to the stick and propped this up in a crack of the lava
The scarf waved in the wind
That done the Indian bade Gale watch
Once again he leveled the glass at the sheep
All five were motionless standing like statues heads pointed across the gully
They were more than a mile distant
When Gale looked without his glass they merged into the roughness of the lava
He was intensely interested
Did the sheep see the red scarf
It seemed incredible but nothing else could account for that statuesque alertness
The sheep held this rigid position for perhaps fifteen minutes
Then the leading ram started to approach
The others followed
He took a few steps then halted
Always he held his head up nose pointed
By George theyre coming
exclaimed Gale
They see that flag
Theyre hunting us
Theyre curious
If this doesnt beat me
Evidently the Indian understood for he grunted
Gale found difficulty in curbing his impatience
The approach of the sheep was slow
The advances of the leader and the intervals of watching had a singular regularity
He worked like a machine
Gale followed him down the opposite wall around holes across gullies over ridges
Then Gale shifted the glass back to find the others
They were coming also with exactly the same pace and pause of their leader
What steppers they were
How surefooted
What leaps they made
It was thrilling to watch them
Gale forgot he had a rifle
The Yaqui pressed a heavy hand down upon his shoulder
He was to keep well hidden and to be quiet
Gale suddenly conceived the idea that the sheep might come clear across to investigate the puzzling red thing fluttering in the breeze
Strange indeed would that be for the wildest creatures in the world
The big ram led on with the same regular persistence and in half an hours time he was in the bottom of the great gulf and soon he was facing up the slope
Gale knew then that the alluring scarf had fascinated him
It was no longer necessary now for Gale to use his glass
There was a short period when an intervening crest of lava hid the sheep from view
After that the two rams and their smaller followers were plainly in sight for perhaps a quarter of an hour
Then they disappeared behind another ridge
Gale kept watching sure they would come out farther on
A tense period of waiting passed then a suddenly electrifying pressure of Yaquis hand made Gale tremble with excitement
Very cautiously he shifted his position
There not fifty feet distant upon a high mound of lava stood the leader of the sheep
His size astounded Gale
He seemed all horns
But only for a moment did the impression of horns overbalancing body remain with Gale
The sheep was graceful sinewy slender powerfully built and in poise magnificent
As Gale watched spellbound the second ram leaped lightly upon the mound and presently the three others did likewise
Then indeed Gale feasted his eyes with a spectacle for a hunter
It came to him suddenly that there had been something he expected to see in this Rocky Mountain bighorn and it was lacking
They were beautiful as wonderful as even Ladds encomiums had led him to suppose
He thought perhaps it was the contrast these soft sleek shortfurred graceful animals afforded to what he imagined the barren terrible lava mountains might develop
The splendid leader stepped closer his round protruding amber eyes which Gale could now plainly see intent upon that fatal red flag
Like automatons the other four crowded into his tracks
A few little slow steps then the leader halted
At this instant Gales absorbed attention was directed by Yaqui to the rifle and so to the purpose of the climb
A little cold shock affronted Gales vivid pleasure
With it dawned a realization of what he had imagined was lacking in these animals
They did not look wild
the socalled wildest of wild creatures appeared tamer than sheep he had followed on a farm
It would be little less than murder to kill them
Gale regretted the need of slaughter
Nevertheless he could not resist the desire to show himself and see how tame they really were
He reached for the 405 and as he threw a shell into the chamber the slight metallic click made the sheep jump
Then Gale rose quickly to his feet
The noble ram and his band simply stared at Gale
They had never seen a man
They showed not the slightest indication of instinctive fear
Curiosity surprise even friendliness seemed to mark their attitude of attention
Gale imagined that they were going to step still closer
He did not choose to wait to see if this were true
Certainly it already took a grim resolution to raise the heavy 405
His shot killed the big leader
The others bounded away with remarkable nimbleness
Gale used up the remaining four shells to drop the second ram and by the time he had reloaded the others were out of range
The Yaquis method of hunting was sure and deadly and saving of energy but Gale never would try it again
He chose to stalk the game
This entailed a great expenditure of strength the eyes and lungs of a mountaineer and as Gale put it to Ladd the need of sevenleague boots
After being hunted a few times and shot at the sheep became exceedingly difficult to approach
Gale learned to know that their fame as the keenesteyed of all animals was well founded
If he worked directly toward a flock crawling over the sharp lava always a sentinel ram espied him before he got within range
The only method of attack that he found successful was to locate sheep with his glass work round to windward of them and then getting behind a ridge or buttress crawl like a lizard to a vantage point
He failed often
The stalk called forth all that was in him of endurance cunning speed
As the days grew hotter he hunted in the early morning hours and a while before the sun went down
More than one night he lay out on the lava with the great stars close overhead and the immense void all beneath him
This pursuit he learned to love
Upon those scarred and blasted slopes the wild spirit that was in him had free rein
And like a shadow the faithful Yaqui tried ever to keep at his heels
One morning the rising sun greeted him as he surmounted the higher cone of the volcano
He saw the vastness of the east algow with a glazed rosy whiteness like the changing hue of an ember
At this height there was a sweeping wind still cool
The western slopes of lava lay dark and all that world of sand and gulf and mountain barrier beyond was shrouded in the mystic cloud of distance
Gale had assimilated much of the loneliness and the sense of ownership and the love of lofty heights that might well belong to the great condor of the peak
Like this widewinged bird he had an unparalleled range of vision
The very corners whence came the winds seemed pierced by Gales eyes
Yaqui spied a flock of sheep far under the curved broken rim of the main crater
Then began the stalk
Gale had taught the Yaqui somethingthat speed might win as well as patient cunning
Keeping out of sight Gale ran over the spikecrusted lava leaving the Indian far behind
His feet were magnets attracting supporting holds and he passed over them too fast to fall
The wind the keen air of the heights the red lava the boundless surrounding blue all seemed to have something to do with his wildness
Then hiding slipping creeping crawling he closed in upon his quarry until the long rifle grew like stone in his grip and the whipping spang ripped the silence and the strange echo boomed deep in the crater and rolled around as if in hollow mockery at the hopelessness of escape
Gales exultant yell was given as much to free himself of some bursting joy of action as it was to call the slower Yaqui
Then he liked the strange echoes
It was a maddening whirl of sound that bored deeper and deeper along the whorled and caverned walls of the crater
It was as if these aged walls resented the violating of their silent sanctity
Gale felt himself a man a thing alive something superior to all this savage dead upflung world of iron a master even of all this grandeur and sublimity because he had a soul
He waited beside his quarry and breathed deep and swept the long slopes with searching eyes of habit
When Yaqui came up they set about the hardest task of all to pack the best of that heavy sheep down miles of steep ragged choyacovered lava
But even in this Gale rejoiced
The heat was nothing the millions of little pits which could hold and twist a foot were nothing the bladeedged crusts and the deep fissures and the choked canyons and the tangled dwarfed mesquites all these were as nothing but obstacles to be cheerfully overcome
Only the choya hindered Dick Gale
When his heavy burden pulled him out of surefootedness and he plunged into a choya or when the strange deceitful uncanny almost invisible frosty thorns caught and pierced him then there was call for all of fortitude and endurance
For this cactus had a malignant power of torture
Its pain was a stinging blinding burning sickening poison in the blood
If thorns pierced his legs he felt the pain all over his body if his hands rose from a fall full of the barbed joints he was helpless and quivering till Yaqui tore them out
But this one peril dreaded more than dizzy height of precipice or sunblindness on the glistening peak did not daunt Gale
His teacher was the Yaqui and always before him was an example that made him despair of a white mans equality
Color race blood breedingwhat were these in the wilderness
Verily Dick Gale had come to learn the use of his hands
So in a descent of hours he toiled down the lava slope to stalk into the arroyo like a burdened giant wringing wet panting cleareyed and darkfaced his ragged clothes and boots white with choya thorns
The gaunt Ladd rose from his shaded seat and removed his pipe from smiling lips and turned to nod at Jim and then looked back again
The torrid summer heat came imperceptibly or it could never have been borne by white men
It changed the lives of the fugitives making them partly nocturnal in habit
The nights had the balmly coolness of spring and would have been delightful for sleep but that would have made the blazing days unendurable
The sun rose in a vast white flame
With it came the blasting withering wind from the gulf
A red haze like that of earlier sunsets seemed to come sweeping on the wind and it roared up the arroyo and went bellowing into the crater and rushed on in fury to lash the peaks
During these hot windy hours the desertbound party slept in deep recesses in the lava and if necessity brought them forth they could not remain out long
the sand burned through boots and a touch of bare hand on lava raised a blister
A short while before sundown the Yaqui went forth to build a campfire and soon the others came out heatdazed half blinded with parching throats to allay and hunger that was never satisfied
A little action and a cooling of the air revived them and when night set in they were comfortable round the campfire
As Ladd had said one of their greatest problems was the passing of time
The nights were interminably long but they had to be passed in work or play or dreamanything except sleep
That was Ladds most inflexible command
He gave no reason
But not improbably the ranger thought that the terrific heat of the day spend in slumber lessened a wear and strain if not a real danger of madness
Accordingly at first the occupations of this little group were many and various
They worked if they had something to do or could invent a pretext
They told and retold stories until all were wearisome
They sang songs
Mercedes taught Spanish
They played every game they knew
They invented others that were so trivial children would scarcely have been interested and these they played seriously
In a word with intelligence and passion with all that was civilized and human they fought the everinfringing loneliness the savage solitude of their environment
But they had only finite minds
It was not in reason to expect a complete victory against this mighty Nature this bounding horizon of death and desolation and decay
Gradually they fell back upon fewer and fewer occupations until the time came when the silence was hard to break
Gale believed himself the keenest of the party the one who thought most and he watched the effect of the desert upon his companions
He imagined that he saw Ladd grow old sitting round the campfire
Certain it was that the rangers gray hair had turned white
What had been at times ahrd and cold and grim about him had strangely vanished in sweet temper and a vacantmindedness that held him longer as the days passed
For hours it seemed Ladd would bend over his checkerboard and never make a move
It mattered not now whether or not he had a partner
He was always glad of being spoken to as if he were called back from vague region of mind
Jim Lash the calmest coolest most nonchalant besthumored Westerner Gale had ever met had by slow degrees lost that cheerful character which would have been of such infinite good to his companions and always he sat broding silently brooding
Jim had no ties few memories and the desert was claiming him
Thorne and Mercedes however were living wonderful proof that spirit mind and heart were freefree to soar in scorn of the colossal barrenness and silence and space of that terrible hedging prison of lava
They were young they loved they were together and the oasis was almost a paradise
Gale believe he helped himself by watching them
Imagination had never pictured real happiness to him
Thorne and Mercedes had forgotten the outside world
If they had been existing on the burnedout desolate moon they could hardly have been in a harsher grimmer lonelier spot than this redwalled arroyo
But it might have been statelier Eden than that of the primitive day
Mercedes grew thinner until she was a slender shadow of her former self
She became hard brown as the rangers lithe and quick as a panther
She seemed to live on water and the airperhaps indeed on love
For of the scant fare the best of which was continually urged upon her she partook but little
She reminded Gale of a wild brown creature free as the wind on the lava slopes
Yet despite the great change her beauty remained undiminished
Her eyes seeming so much larger now in her small face were great black starry gulfs
She was the life of that camp
Her smiles her rapid speech her low laughter her quick movements her playful moods with the rangers the dark and passionate glance which rested so often on her lover the whispers in the dusk as hand in hand they paced the campfire beatthese helped Gale to retain his loosening hold on reality to resist the lure of a strange beckoning life where a man stood free in the golden open where emotion was not nor trouble nor sickness nor anything but the savages rest and sleep and action and dream
Although the Yaqui was as his shadow Gale reached a point when he seemed to wander alone at twilight in the night at dawn
Far down the arroyo in the deepening red twilight when the heat rolled away on slowdying wind Blanco Sol raised his splendid head and whistled for his master
Gale reproached himself for neglect of the noble horse
Blanco Sol was always the same
He loved four thingshis master a long drink of cool water to graze at will and to run
Time and place Gale thought meant little to Sol if he could have those four things
Gale put his arm over the great arched neck and laid his cheek against the long white mane and then even as he stood there forgot the horse
What was the dull redtinged horizonwide mantle creeping up the slope
Through it the copper sun glowed paled died
Was it only twilight
Was it gloom
If he thought about it he had a feeling that it was the herald of night and the night must be a vigil and that made him tremble
At night he had formed a habit of climbing up the lava slope as far as the smooth trail extended and there on a promontory he paced to and fro and watched the stars and sat stonestill for hours looking down at the vast void with its moving changing shadows
From that promontory he gazed up at a velvetblue sky deep and dark bright with millions of cold distant blinking stars and he grasped a little of the meaning of infinitude
He gazed down into the shadows which black as they were and impenetrable yet have a conception of immeasurable space
Then the silence
He was dumb he was awed he bowed his head he trembled he marveled at the desert silence
It was the one thing always present
Even when the wind roared there seemed to be silence
But at night in this lava world of ashes and canker he waited for this terrible strangeness of nature to come to him with the secret
He seemed at once a little child and a strong man and something very old
What tortured him was the incomprehensibility that the vaster the space the greater the silence
At one moment Gale felt there was only death here and that was the secret at another he heard the slow beat of a mighty heart
He came at length to realize that the desert was a teacher
He did not realize all that he had learned but he was a different man
And when he decided upon that he was not thinking of the slow sure call to the primal instincts of man he was thinking that the desert as much as he had experienced and no more would absolutely overturn the whole scale of a mans values break old habits form new ones remake him
More of desert experience Gale believe would be too much for intellect
The desert did not breed civilized man and that made Gale ponder over a strange thought after all was the civilized man inferior to the savage
Yaqui was the answer to that
When Gale acknowledged this he always remembered his present strange manner of thought
The past the old order of mind seemed as remote as this desert world was from the haunts of civilized men
A man must know a savage as Gale knew Yaqui before he could speak authoritatively and then something stilled his tongue
In the first stage of Gales observation of Yaqui he had marked tenaciousness of life stoicism endurance strength
These were the attributes of the desert
But what of that second stage wherein the Indian had loomed up a colossal figure of strange honor loyalty love
Gale doubted his convictions and scorned himself for doubting
There in the gloom sat the silent impassive inscrutable Yaqui
His dark face his dark eyes were plain in the light of the stars
Always he was near Gale unobtrusive shadowy but there
Why
Gale absolutely could not doubt that the Indian had heart as well as mind
Yaqui had from the very first stood between Gale and accident toil peril
It was his own choosing
Gale could not change him or thwart him
He understood the Indians idea of obligation and sacred duty
But there was more and that baffled Gale
In the night hours alone on the slope Gale felt in Yaqui as he felt the mighty throb of that desert pulse a something that drew him irresistibly to the Indian
Sometimes he looked around to find the Indian to dispel these strange pressing thoughts of unreality and it was never in vain
Thus the nights passed endlessly long with Gale fighting for his old order of thought fighting the fascination of the infinite sky and the gloomy insulating whirl of the wide shadows fighting for belief hope prayer fighting against that terrible everrecurring idea of being lost lost lost in the desert fighting harder than any other thing the insidious penetrating tranquil unfeeling self that was coming between him and his memory
He was losing the battle losing his hold on tangible things losing his power to stand up under this ponderous merciless weight of desert space and silence
He acknowledged it in a kind of despair and the shadows of the night seemed whirling fiends
Lost
Lost
Lost
What are you waiting for
Rain


Lost
Lost
Lost in the desert
So the shadows seemed to scream in voiceless mockery
At the moment he was alone on the promontory
The night was far spent
A ghastly moon haunted the black volcanic spurs
The winds blew silently
Was he alone
No
he did not seem to be alone
The Yaqui was there
Suddenly a strange cold sensation crept over Gale
It was new
He felt a presence
Turning he expected to see the Indian but instead a slight shadow pale almost white stood there not close nor yet distant
It seemed to brighten
Then he saw a woman who resembled a girl he had seemed to know long ago
She was whitefaced goldenhaired and her lips were sweet and her eyes were turning black
Nell
He had forgotten her
Over him flooded a torrent of memory
There was tragic woe in this sweet face
Nell was holding out her armsshe was crying aloud to him across the sand and the cactus and the lava
She was in trouble and he had been forgetting
That night he climbed the lava to the topmost cone and never slipped on a ragged crust nor touched a choya thorn
A voice called to him
He saw Nells eyes in the stars in the velvet blue of sky in the blackness of the engulfing shadows
She was with him a slender shape a spirit keeping step with him and memory was strong sweet beating beautiful
Far down in the west faintly golden with light of the sinking moon he saw a cloud that resembled her face
A cloud on the desert horizon
He gazed and gazed
Was that a spirit face like the one by his side
Nohe did not dream
In the hot sultry morning Yaqui appeared at camp after long hours of absence and he pointed with a long dark arm toward the west
A bank of clouds was rising above the mountain barrier
Rain
he cried and his sonorous voice rolled down the arroyo
Those who heard him were as shipwrecked mariners at sight of a distant sail
Dick Gale silent grateful to the depths of his soul stood with arm over Blanco Sol and watched the transforming west where clouds of wonderous size and hue piled over one another rushing darkening spreading sweeping upward toward that white and glowing sun
When they reached the zenish and swept round to blot out the blazing orb the earth took on a dark lowering aspect
The red of sand and lava changed to steely gray
Vast shadows like ripples on water sheeted in from the gulf with a low strange moan
Yet the silence was like death
The desert was awaiting a strange and hated visitationstorm
If all the endless torrid days the endless mystic nights had seemed unreal to Gale what then seemed this stupendous spectacle
Oh
I felt a drop of rain on my face
cried Mercedes and whispering the name of a saint she kissed her husband
The whitehaired Ladd gaunt old bent looked up at the maelstrom of clouds and he said softly Shore well get in the hosses an pack light an hit the trail an make night marches
Then up out of the gulf of the west swept a bellowing wind and a black pall and terrible flashes of lightning and thunder like the end of the worldfury blackness chaos the desert storm
XVII The Whistle Of A Horse At the ranchhouse at Forlorn River Belding stood alone in his darkened room
It was quiet there and quiet outside the sickening midsummer heat like a hot heavy blanket lay upon the house
He took up the gun belt from his table and with slow hands buckled it around his waist
He seemed to feel something familiar and comfortable and inspiring in the weight of the big gun against his hip
He faced the door as if to go out but hesitated and then began a slow plodding walk up and down the length of the room
Presently he halted at the table and with reluctant hands he unbuckled the gun belt and laid it down
The action did not have an air of finality and Belding knew it
He had seen border life in Texas in the early days he had been a sheriff when the law in the West depended on a quickness of wrist he had seen many a man lay down his gun for good and all
His own action was not final
Of late he had done the same thing many times and this last time it seemed a little harder to do a little more indicative of vacillation
There were reasons why Beldings gun held for him a gloomy fascination
The Chases those grasping and conscienceless agents of a new force in the development of the West were bent upon Beldings ruin and so far as his fortunes at Forlorn River were concerned had almost accomplished it
One by one he lost points for which he contended with them
He carried into the Tucson courts the matter of the staked claims and mining claims and water claims and he lost all
Following that he lost his government position as inspector of immigration and this fact because of what he considered its injustice had been a hard blow
He had been made to suffer a humiliation equally as great
It came about that he actually had to pay the Chases for water to irrigate his alfalfa fields
The neverfailing spring upon his land answered for the needs of household and horses but no more
These matters were unfortunate for Belding but not by any means wholly accountable for his worry and unhappiness and brooding hate
He believed Dick Gale and the rest of the party taken into the desert by the Yaqui had been killed or lost
Two months before a string of Mexican horses riderless saddled starved for grass and wild for water had come in to Forlorn River
They were a part of the horses belonging to Rojas and his band
Their arrival complicated the mystery and strengthened convictions of the loss of both pursuers and pursued
Belding was wont to say that he had worried himself gray over the fate of his rangers
Beldings unhappiness could hardly be laid to material loss
He had been rich and was now poor but change of fortune such as that could not have made him unhappy
Something more somber and mysterious and sad than the loss of Dick Gale and their friends had come into the lives of his wife and Nell
He dated the time of this change back to a certain day when Mrs Belding recognized in the elder Chase an old schoolmate and a rejected suitor
It took time for slowthinking Belding to discover anything wrong in his household especially as the fact of the Gales lingering there made Mrs Belding and Nell for the most part hide their read and deeper feelings
Gradually however Belding had forced on him the fact of some secret cause for grief other than Gales loss
He was sure of it when his wife signified her desire to make a visit to her old home back in Peoria
She did not give many reasons but she did show him a letter that had found its way from old friends
This letter contained news that may or may not have been authentic but it was enough Belding thought to interest his wife
An old prospector had returned to Peoria and he had told relatives of meeting Robert Burton at the Sonoyta Oasis fifteen years before and that Burton had gone into the desert never to return
To Belding this was no surprise for he had heard that before his marriage
There appeared to have been no doubts as to the death of his wifes first husband
The singular thing was that both Nells father and grandfather had been lost somewhere in the Sonora Desert
Belding did not oppose his wifes desire to visit her old home
He thought it would be a wholesome trip for her and did all in his power to persuade Nell to accompany her
But Nell would not go
It was after Mrs Beldings departure that Belding discovered in Nell a condition of mind that amazed and distressed him
She had suddenly become strangely wretched so that she could not conceal it from even the Gales who of all people Belding imagined were the ones to make Nell proud
She would tell him nothing
But after a while when he had thought it out he dated this further and more deplorable change in Nell back to a day on which he had met Nell with Radford Chase
This indefatigable wooer had not in the least abandoned his suit
Something about the fellow made Belding grind his teeth
But Nell grew not only solicitously but now strangely entreatingly earnest in her importunities to Belding not ot insult or lay a hand on Chase
This had bound Belding so far it had made him think and watch
He had never been a man to interfere with his women folk
They could do as they liked and usually that pleased him
But a slow surprise gathered and grew upon him when he saw that Nell apparently was accepting young Chases attentions
At least she no longer hid from him
Belding could not account for this because he was sure Nell cordially despised the fellow
And toward the end he divined if he did not actually know that these Chases possessed some strange power over Nell and were using it
That stirred a hate in Beldinga hate he had felt at the very first and had manfully striven against and which now gave him over to dark brooding thoughts
Midsummer passed and the storms came late
But when they arrived they made up for tardiness
Belding did not remember so terrible a storm of wind and rain as that which broke the summers drought
In a few days it seemed Altar Valley was a bright and green expanse where dust clouds did not rise
Forlorn River ran a slow heavy turgid torrent
Belding never saw the river in flood that it did not give him joy yet now desert man as he was he suffered a regret when he thought of the great Chase reservoir full and overflowing
The dull thunder of the spillway was not pleasant
It was the first time in his life that the sound of falling water jarred upon him
Belding noticed workmen once more engaged in the fields bounding his land
The Chases had extended a main irrigation ditch down to Beldings farm skipped the width of his ground then had gone on down through Altar Valley
They had exerted every influence to obtain right to connect these ditches by digging through his land but Belding had remained obdurate
He refused to have any dealings with them
It was therefore with some curiosity and suspicion that he was a gang of Mexicans once more at work upon these ditches
At daylight next morning a tremendous blast almost threw Belding out of his bed
It cracked the adobe walls of his house and broke windows and sent pans and crockery to the floor with a crash
Beldings idea was that the store of dynamite kept by the Chases for blasting had blown up
Hurriedly getting into his clothes he went to Nells room to reassure her and telling her to have a thought for their guests he went out to see what had happened
The villagers were pretty badly frightened
Many of the poorly constructed adobe huts had crumbled almost into dust
A great yellow cloud like smoke hung over the river
This appeared to be at the upper end of Beldings plot and close to the river
When he reached his fence the smoke and dust were so thick he could scarcely breathe and for a little while he was unable to see what had happened
Presently he made out a huge hole in the sand just abut where the irrigation ditch had stopped near his line
For some reason or other not clear to Belding the Mexicans had set off an extraordinarily heavy blast at that point
Belding pondered
He did not now for a moment consider an accidental discharge of dynamite
But why had this blast been set off
The loose sandy soil had yielded readily to shovel there were no rocks as far as construction of a ditch was concerned such a blast would have odne more harm than good
Slowly with reluctant feet Belding walked toward a green hollow where in a cluster of willows lay the neverfailing spring that his horses loved so well and indeed which he loved no less
He was actually afraid to part the drooping willows to enter the little cool shady path that led to the spring
Then suddenly seized by suspense he ran the rest of the way
He was just in time to see the last of the water
It seemed to sink as in quicksand
The shape of the hole had changed
The tremendous force of the blast in the adjoining field had obstructed or diverted the underground stream of water
Beldings neverfailing spring had been ruined
What had made this little plot of ground green and sweet and fragrant was now no more
Beldings first feeling was for the pity of it
The pale Ajo lilies would bloom no more under those willows
The willows themselves would soon wither and die
He thought how many times in the middle of hot summer nights he had come down to the spring to drink
Never again
Suddenly he thought of Blanco Diablo
How the great white thoroughbred had loved this spring
Belding straightened up and looked with tearblurred eyes out over the waste of desert to the west
Never a day passed that he had not thought of the splendid horse but this moment with its significant memory was doubly keen and there came a dull pang in his breast
Diablo will never drink here again
muttered Belding
The loss of Blanco Diablo though admitted and mourned by Belding had never seemed quite real until this moment
The pall of dust drifting over him the din of the falling water up at the dam diverted Beldings mind to the Chases
All at once he was in the harsh grip of a cold certainty
The blast had been set off intentionally to ruin his spring
What a hellish trick
No Westerner no Indian or Mexican no desert man could have been guilty of such a crime
To ruin a beautiful clear cool neverfailing stream of water in the desert
It was then that Beldings worry and indecision and brooding were as if they had never existed
As he strode swiftly back to the house his head which had long been bent thoughtfully and sadly was held erect
He went directly to his room and with an air that was now final he buckled on his gun belt
He looked the gun over and tried the action
He squared himself and walked a little more erect
Some longlost individuality had returned to Belding
Lets see he was saying
I can get Carter to send the horses Ive left back to Waco to my brother
Ill make Nell take what money there is and go hunt up her mother
The Gales are ready to gotoday if I say the word
Nell can travel with them part way East
Thats your game Tom Belding dont mistake me
As he went out he encountered Mr Gale coming up the walk
The long sojourn at Forlorn River despite the fact that it had been laden with a suspense which was gradually changing to a sad certainty had been of great benefit to Dicks father
The dry air the heat and the quiet had made him if not entirely a well man certainly stronger than he had been in many years
Belding what was that terrible roar
asked Mr Gale
We were badly frightened until Miss Nell came to us
We feared it was an earthquake
Well Ill tell you Mr Gale weve had some quakes here but none of them could hold a candle to this jar we just had
Then Belding explained what had caused the explosion and why it had been set off so close to his property
Its an outrage sir an unspeakable outrage declared Mr Gale hotly
Such a thing would not be tolerated in the East
Mr Belding Im amazed at your attitude in the face of all this trickery
You seethere was mother and Nell began Belding as if apologizing
He dropped his head a little and made marks in the sand with the toe of his boot
Mr Gale Ive been sort of half hitched as Laddy used to say
Im planning to have a little more elbow room round this ranch
Im going to send Nell East to her mother
Then Ill See here Mr Gale would you mind having Nell with you part way when you go home
Wed all be delighted to have her go all the way and make us a visit replied Mr Gale
Thats fine
And youll be going soon
Dont take that as if I wanted to Belding paused for the truth was that he did want to hurry them off
We would have been gone before this but for you said Mr Gale
Long ago we gave up hope ofof Richard ever returning
And I believe now were sure he was lost that wed do well to go home at once
You wished us to remain until the heat was brokentill the rains came to make traveling easier for us
Now I see no need for further delay
My stay here has greatly benefited my health
I shall never forget your hospitality
This Western trip would have made me a new man ifonlyRichard Sure
I understand said Belding gruffly
Lets go in and tell the women to pack up
Nell was busy with the servants preparing breakfast
Belding took her into the sittingroom while Mr Gale called his wife and daughter
My girl Ive some news for you began Belding
Mr Gale is leaving today with his family
Im going to send you with thempart way anyhow
Youre invited to visit them
I think that d be great for youhelp you to forget
But the main thing isyoure going East to join mother
Nell gazed at him whitefaced without uttering a word
You see Nell Im about done in Forlorn River went on Belding
That blast this morning sank my spring
Theres no water now
It was the last straw
So well shake the dust of Forlorn River
Ill come on a little laterthats all
Dad youre packing your gun
exclaimed Nell suddenly pointing with a trembling finger
She ran to him and for the first time in his life Belding put her away from him
His movements had lost the old slow gentleness
Why so I am replied Belding coolly as his hand moved down to the sheath swinging at his hip
Nell Im that absentminded these days
Dad
she cried
Thatll do from you he replied in a voice he had never used to her
Get breakfast now then pack to leave Forlorn River
Leave Forlorn River
whispered Nell with a thin white hand stealing up to her breast
How changed the girl was
Belding reproached himself for his hardness but did not speak his thought aloud
Nell was fading here just as Mercedes had faded before the coming of Thorne
Nell turned away to the west window and looked out across the desert toward the dim blue peaks in the distance
Belding watched her likewise the Gales and no one spoke
There ensued a long silence
Belding felt a lump rise in his throat
Nell laid her arm against the window frame but gradually it dropped and she was leaning with her face against the wood
A low sob broke from her
Elsie Gale went to her embraced her took the drooping head on her shoulder
Weve come to be such friends she said
I believe itll be good for you to visit me in the city
Hereall day you look out across that awful lonely desertCome Nell
Heavy steps sounded outside on the flagstones then the door rattled under a strong knock
Belding opened it
The Chases father and son stood beyond the threshold
Good morning Belding said the elder Chase
We were routed out early by that big blast and came up to see what was wrong
All a blunder
The Greaser foreman was drunk yesterday and his ignorant men made a mistake
Sorry if the blast bothered you
Chase I reckon thats the first of your blasts I was ever glad to hear replied Belding in a way that made Chase look blank
So
Well Im glad youre glad he went on evidently puzzled
I was a little worriedyouve always been so touchywe never could get together
I hurried over fearing maybe you might think the blastyou see Belding I see this Mr Ben Chase interrupted Belding in curt and ringing voice
That blast was a mistake the biggest you ever made in your life
What do you mean
demanded Chase
Youll have to excuse me for a while unless youre dead set on having it out right now
Mr Gale and his family are leaving and my daughter is going with them
Id rather youd wait a little
Nell going away
exclaimed Radford Chase
He reminded Belding of an overgrown boy in disappointment
Yes
ButMiss Burton to you young man Mr Belding I certainly would prefer a conference with you right now interposed the elder Chase cutting short Beldings strange speech
There are other mattersimportant matters to discuss
Theyve got to be settled
May we step in sir
No you may not replied Belding bluntly
Im sure particular who I invite into my house
But Ill go with you
Belding stepped out and closed the door
Come away from the house so the women wont hear thethe talk
The elder Chase was purple with rage yet seemed to be controlling it
The younger man looked black sullen impatient
He appeared not to have a thought of Belding
He was absolutely blind to the situation as considered from Beldings point of view
Ben Chase found his voice about the time Belding halted under the trees out of earshot from the house
Sir youve insulted memy son
How dare you
I want you to understand that youre Chop that kind of talk with me you    
interrupted Belding
He had always been profane and now he certainly did not choose his language
Chase turned livid gasped and seemed about to give way to fury
But something about Belding evidently exerted a powerful quieting influence
If you talk sense Ill listen went on Belding
Belding was frankly curious
He did not think any argument or inducement offerd by Chase could change his mind on past dealings or his purpose of the present
But he believed by listening he might get some light on what had long puzzled him
The masterly effort Chase put forth to conquer his aroused passions gave Belding another idea of the character of this promoter
I want to make a last effort to propitiate you began Chase in his quick smooth voice
That was a singular change to Beldingthe dropping instantly into an easy flow of speech
Youve had losses here and naturally youre sore
I dont blame you
But you cant see this thing from my side of the fence
Business is business
In business the best man wins
The law upheld those transactions of mine the honesty of which you questioned
As to mining and water claims you lost on this technical pointthat you had nothing to prove you had held them for five years
Five years is the time necessary in law
A dozen men might claim the source of Forlorn River but if they had no house or papers to prove their squatters rights any man could to in and fight them for the water
Now I want to run that main ditch along the river through your farm
Cant we make a deal
Im ready to be liberalto meet you more than halfway
Ill give you an interest in the company
I think Ive influence enough up at the Capitol to have you reinstated as inspector
A little reasonableness on your part will put you right again in Forlorn River with a chance of growing rich
Theres a big future hereMy interest Belding has become personal
Radford is in love with your stepdaughter
He wants to marry her
Ill admit now if I had foreseen this situation I wouldnt have pushed you so hard
But we can square the thing
Now lets get together not only in business but in a family way
If my sons happiness depends upon having this girl you may rest assured Ill do all I can to get her for him
Ill absolutely make good all your losses
Now what do you say
No replied Belding
Your money cant buy a right of way across my ranch
And Nell doesnt want your son
That settles that
But you could persuade her
I wont thats all
May I ask why
Chasess voice was losing its suave quality but it was even swifter than before
Sure
I dont mind your asking replied Belding in slow deliberation
I wouldnt do such a lowdown trick
Besides if I would Id want it to be a man I was persuading for
I know GreasersI know a Yaqui Id rather give Nell to than your son
Radford Chase began to roar in inarticulate rage
Belding paid no attention to him indeed he never glanced at the young man
The elder Chase checked a violent start
He plucked at the collar of his gray flannel shirt opened it at the neck
My sons offer of marriage is an honormore an honor sir than you perhaps are aware of
Belding made no reply
His steady gaze did not turn from the long lane that led down to the river
He waited coldly sure of himself
Mrs Beldings daughter has no right to the name of Burton snapped Chase
Did you know that
I did not replied Belding quietly
Well you know it now added Chase bitingly
Sure you can prove what you say
queried Belding in the same cool unemotional tone
It struck him strangely at the moment what little knowledge this man had of the West and of Western character
Prove it
Why yes I think so enough to make the truth plain to any reasonable man
I come from Peoriawas born and raised there
I went to school with Nell Warren
That was your wifes maiden name
She was a beautiful gay girl
All the fellows were in love with her
I knew Bob Burton well
He was a splendid fellow but wild
Nobody ever knew for sure but we all supposed he was engaged to marry Nell
He left Peoria however and soon after that the truth about Nell came out
She ran away
It was at least a couple of months before Burton showed up in Peoria
He did not stay long
Then for years nothing was heard of either of them
When word did come Nell was in Oklahoma Burton was in Denver
Theres chance of course that Burton followed Nell and married her
That would account for Nell Warren taking the name of Burton
But it isnt likely
None of us ever heard of such a thing and wouldnt have believed it if we had
The affair seemed destined to end unfortunately
But Belding while Im at it I want to say that Nell Warren was one of the sweetest finest truest girls in the world
If she drifted to the Southwest and kept her past a secret that was only natural
Certainly it should not be held against her
Why she was only a childa girlseventeeneighteen years oldIn a moment of amazementwhen I recognized your wife as an old schoolmateI blurted the thing out to Radford
You see now how little it matters to me when I ask your stepdaughters hand in marriage for my son
Belding stood listening
The genuine emotion in Chases voice was as strong as the ring of truth
Belding knew truth when he heard it
The revelation did not surprise him
Belding did not soften for he devined that Chases emotion was due to the probing of an old wound the recalling of a past both happy and painful
Still human nature was so strange that perhaps kindness and sympathy might yet have a place in this Chases heart
Belding did not believe so but he was willing to give Chase the benefit of the doubt
So you told my wife youd respect her secretkeep her dishonor from husband and daughter
demanded Belding his dark gaze sweeping back from the lane
What
II stammered Chase
You made your son swear to be a man and die before hed hint the thing to Nell
went on Belding and his voice rang louder
Ben Chase had no answer
The red left his face
His son slunk back against the fence
I say you never held this secret over the heads of my wife and her daughter
thundered Belding
He had his answer in the gray faces in the lips that fear made mute
Like a flash Belding saw the whole truth of Mrs Beldings agony the reason for her departure he saw what had been driving Nell and it seemed that all the dogs of hell were loosed within his heart
He struck out blindly instinctively in his pain and the blow sent Ben Chase staggering into the fence corner
Then he stretched forth a long arm and whirled Radford Chase back beside his father
I see it all now went on Belding hoarsely
You found the womans weaknessher love for the girl
You found the girls weaknessher pride and fear of shame
So you drove the one and hounded the other
God what a base thing to do
To tell the girl was bad enough but to threaten her with betrayal theres no name for that
Beldings voice thickened and he paused breathing heavily
He stepped back a few paces and this an ominous action for an armed man of his kind instead of adding to the fear of the Chases seemed to relieve them
If there had been any pity in Beldings heart he would have felt it then
And now gentlemen continued Belding speaking low and with difficulty seeing Ive turned down your proposition I suppose you think youve no more call to keep your mouths shut
The elder Chase appeared fascinated by something he either saw or felt in Belding and his gray face grew grayer
He put up a shaking hand
Then Radford Chase livid and snarling burst out Ill talk till Im black in the face
You cant stop me
Youll go black in the face but it wont be from talking hissed Belding
His big arm swept down and when he threw it up the gun glittered in his hand
Simultaneously with the latter action pealed out a shrill penetrating whistle
The whistle of a horse
It froze Beldings arm aloft
For an instant he could not move even his eyes
The familiarity of that whistle was terrible in its power to rob him of strength
Then he heard the rapid heavy pound of hoofs and again the piercing whistle
Blanco Diablo
he cried huskily
He turned to see a huge white horse come thundering into the yard
A wild gaunt terrible horse indeed the loved Blanco Diablo
A bronzed longhaired Indian bestrode him
More white horses galloped into the yard pounded to a halt whistling home
Belding saw a slim shadow of a girl who seemed all great black eyes
Under the trees flashed Blanco Sol as dazzling white as beautiful as if he had never been lost in the desert
He slid to a halt then plunged and stamped
His rider leaped throwing the bridle
Belding saw a powerful spare ragged man with dark gaunt face and eyes of flame
Then Nell came running from the house her golden hair flying her hands outstretched her face wonderful
Dick
Dick
Ohhh Dick
she cried
Her voice seemed to quiver in Beldings heart
Beldings eyes began to blur
He was not sure he saw clearly
Whose face was this now close before hima long thin shrunken face haggard tragic in its semblance of torture almost of death
But the eyes were keen and kind
Belding thought wildly that they proved he was not dreaming
I shore am glad to see you all said a wellremembered voice in a slow cool drawl
XVIII Reality Against Dreams Ladd Lash Thorne Mercedes they were all held tight in Beldings arms
Then he ran to Blanco Diablo
For once the great horse was gentle quiet glad
He remembered this kindest of masters and reached for him with warm wet muzzle
Dick Gale was standing bowed over Nells slight form almost hidden in his arms
Belding hugged them both
He was like a boy
He saw Ben Chase and his son slip away under the trees but the circumstances meant nothing to him then
Dick
Dick
he roared
Is it youSay who do you thinks herehere in Forlorn River
Gale gripped Belding with a hand as rough and hard as a file and as strong as a vise
But he did not speak a word
Belding thought Gales eyes would haunt him forever
It was then three more persons came upon the sceneElsie Gale running swiftly her father assisting Mrs Gale who appeared about to faint
Belding
Who on earths that
cried Dick Hoarsely
Quien sabe my son replied Belding and now his voice seemed a little shaky
Nell come here
Give him a chance
Belding slipped his arm round Nell and whispered in her ear
This ll be great
Elsie Gales face was white and agitated a face expressing extreme joy
Oh brother
Mama saw youPapa saw you and never knew you
But I knew you when you jumped quickthat wayoff your horse
And now I dont know you
You wild man
You giant
You splendid barbarianMama Papa hurry
It is Dick
Look at him
Just look at him
Ohh thank God
Belding turned away and drew Nell with him
In another second she and Mercedes were clasped in each others arms
Then followed a time of joyful greetings all round
The Yaqui stood leaning against a tree watching the welcoming home of the lost
No one seemed to think of him until Belding ever mindful of the needs of horses put a hand on Blanco Diablo and called to Yaqui to bring the others
They led the string of whites down to the barn freed them of wet and dusty saddles and packs and turned them loose in the alfalfa now breasthigh
Diablo found his old spirit Blanco Sol tossed his head and whistled his satisfaction White Woman pranced to and fro and presently they all settled down to quiet grazing
How good it was for Belding to see those white shapes against the rich background of green
His eyes glistened
It was a sight he had never expected to see again
He lingered there many moments when he wanted to hurry back to his rangers
At last he tore himself away from watching Blanco Diablo and returned to the house
It was only to find that he might have spared himself the hurry
Jim and Ladd were lying on the beds that had not held them for so many months
Their slumber seemed as deep and quiet as death
Curiously Belding gazed down upon them
They had removed only boots and chaps
Their clothes were in tatters
Jim appeared little more than skin and bones a long shape dark and hard as iron
Ladds appearance shocked Belding
The ranger looked an old man blasted shriveled starved
Yet his gaunt face though terrible in its records of tortures had something fine and noble even beautiful to Belding in its strength its victory
Thorne and Mercedes had disappeared
The low murmur of voices came from Mrs Gales room and Belding concluded that Dick was still with his family
No doubt he also would soon seek rest and sleep
Belding went through the patio and called in at Nells door
She was there sitting by her window
The flush of happiness had not left her face but she looked stunned and a shadow of fear lay dark in her eyes
Belding had intended to talk
He wanted some one to listen to him
The expression in Nells eyes  however silenced him
He had forgotten
Nell read his thought in his face and then she lost all her color and dropped her head
Belding entered stood beside her with a hand on hers
He tried desperately hard to think of the right thing to say and realized so long as he tried that he could not speak at all
NellDicks back safe and sound he said slowly
Thats the main thing
I wish you could have seen his eyes when he held you in his arms out thereOf course Dicks coming knocks out your trip East and changes plans generally
We havent had the happiest time lately
But now it ll be different
Dicks as true as a Yaqui
Hell chase that Chase fellow dont mistake meThen mother will be home soon
Shell straighten out thisthis mystery
And Nellhowever it turns outI know Dick Gale will feel just the same as I feel
Brace up now girl
Belding left the patio and traced thoughtful steps back toward the corrals
He realized the need of his wife
If she had been at home he would not have come so close to killing two men
Nell would never have fallen so low in spirit
Whatever the real truth of the tragedy of his wifes life it would not make the slightest difference to him
What hurt him was the pain mother and daughter had suffered were suffering still
Somehow he must put an end to that pain
He found the Yaqui curled up in a corner of the barn in as deep a sleep as that of the rangers
Looking down at him Belding felt again the rush of curious thrilling eagerness to learn all that had happened since the dark night when Yaqui had led the white horses away into the desert
Belding curbed his impatience and set to work upon tasks he had long neglected
Presently he was interrupted by Mr Gale who came out beside himself with happiness and excitement
He flung a hundred questions at Belding and never gave him time to answer one even if that had been possible
Finally when Mr Gale lost his breath Belding got a word in
See here Mr Gale you know as much as I know
Dicks back
Theyre all backa hard lot starved burned torn to pieces worked out to the limit I never saw in desert travelers but theyre alivealive and well man
Just wait
Just gamble I wont sleep or eat till I hear that story
But theyve got to sleep and eat
Belding gathered with growing amusement that besides the joy excitement anxiety impatience expressed by Mr Gale there was something else which Belding took for pride
It pleased him
Looking back he remembered some of the things Dick had confessed his father thought of him
Beldings sympathy had always been with the boy
But he had learned to like the old man to find him kind and wise and to think that perhaps college and business had not brought out the best in Richard Gale
The West had done that however as it had for many a wild youngster and Belding resolved to have a little fun at the expense of Mr Gale
So he began by making a few remarks that appeared to rob Dicks father of both speech and breath
And dont mistake me concluded Belding just keep out of earshot when Laddy tells us the story of that desert trip unless youre hankering to have your hair turn pure white and stand curled on end and freeze that way
About the middle of the forenoon on the following day the rangers hobbled out of the kitchen to the porch
Im a sick man I tell you Ladd was complaining an I gotta be fed
Soup
Beef tea
That aint so much as wind to me
I want about a barrel of bread an butter an a whole platter of mashed potatoes with gravy an green stuffall kinds of green stuffan a whole big apple pie
Give me everythin an anythin to eat but meat
Shore I never never want to taste meat again an sight of a piece of sheep meat would jest about finish meJim you used to be a human bein that stood up for Charlie Ladd
Laddy Im lined up beside you with both guns replied Jim plaintively
Hungry
Say the smell of breakfast in that kitchen made my mouth water so I near choked to death
I reckon were gettin most onhuman treatment
But Im a sick man protested Ladd an Im agoin to fall over in a minute if somebody doesnt feed me
Nell you used to be fond of me
Oh Laddy I am yet replied Nell
Shore I dont believe it
Any girl with a tender heart just couldnt let a man starve under her eyesLook at Dick there
Ill bet hes had something to eat mebbe potatoes an gravy an pie an Laddy Dick has had no more than I gave youin deed not nearly so much
Shore hes had a lot of kisses then for he hasnt hollered onct about this treatment
Perhaps he has said Nell with a blush and if you think thatthey would help you to be reasonable I mightIll Well powerful fond as I am of you just now kisses ll have to run second to bread an butter
Oh Laddy what a gallant speech
laughed Nell
Im sorry but Ive Dads orders
Laddy interrupted Belding youve got to be broke in gradually to eating
Now you know that
Youd be the severest kind of a boss if you had some starved beggars on your hands
But Im sickIm dyin howled Ladd
You were never sick in your life and if all the bullet holes I see in you couldnt kill you why you never will die
Can I smoke
queried Ladd with sudden animation
My Gawd I used to smoke
Shore Ive forgot
Nell if you want to be reinstated in my gallery of angels just find me a pipe an tobacco
Ive hung onto my pipe said Jim thoughtfully
I reckon I had it empty in my mouth for seven years or so wasnt it Laddy
A long time
I can see the red lava an the red haze an the red twilight creepin up
It was hot an some lonely
Then the wind and always that awful silence
An always Yaqui watchin the west an Laddy with his checkers an Mercedes burnin up wastin away to nothin but eyes
Its all thereIll never get rid Chop that kind of talk interrupted Belding bluntly
Tell us where Yaqui took youwhat happened to Rojaswhy you seemed lost for so long
I reckon Laddy can tell all that best but when it comes to Rojass finish Ill tell what I seen an soll Dick an Thorne
Laddy missed Rojass finish
Bar none that was the Im a sick man but I can talk put in Ladd an shore I dont want the whole story exaggerated none by Jim
Ladd filled the pipe Nell brought puffed ecstatically at it and settled himself upon the bench for a long talk
Nell glanced appealingly at Dick who tried to slip away
Mercedes did go and was followed by Thorne
Mr Gale brought chairs and in subdued excitement called his wife and daughter
Belding leaned forward rendered all the more eager by Dicks reluctance to stay the memory of the quick tragic change in the expression of Mercedess beautiful eyes by the strange gloomy cast stealing over Ladds face
The ranger talked for two hourstalked till his voice weakened to a husky whisper
At the conclusion of his story there was an impressive silence
Then Elsie Gale stood up and with her hand on Dicks shoulder her eyes bright and warm as sunlight she showed the rangers what a woman thought of them and of the Yaqui
Nell clung to Dick weeping silently
Mrs Gale was overcome and Mr Gale very white and quiet helped her up to her room
The Indian
the Indian
burst out Belding his voice deep and rolling
What did I tell you
Didnt I say hed be a godsend
Remember what I said about Yaqui and some gory Aztec knifework
So he cut Rojas loose from that awful crater wall foot by foot finger by finger slow and terrible
And Rojas didnt hang long on the choya thorns
Thank the Lord for thatLaddy no story of Camino del Diablo can hold a candle to yours
The flight and the fight were jobs for men
But living through this long hot summer and coming outthats a miracle
Only the Yaqui could have done it
The Yaqui
The Yaqui
Shore
Charlie Ladd looks up at an Indian these days
But Beldin as for the comin out dont forget the hosses
Without grand old Sol an Diablo who I dont hate no more an the other Blancos wed never have got here
Yaqui an the hosses thats my story
Early in the afternoon of the next day Belding encountered Dick at the water barrel
Belding this is river water and muddy at that said Dick
Lord knows Im not kicking
But Ive dreamed some of our cool running spring and I want a drink from it
Never again son
The springs gone faded sunk dry as dust
Dry
Gale slowly straightened
Weve had rains
The rivers full
The spring ought to be overflowing
Whats wrong
Why is it dry
Dick seeing youre interested I may as well tell you that a big charge of nitroglycerin choked my spring
Nitroglycerin
echoed Gale
Then he gave a quick start
My minds been on home Nell my family
But all the same I felt something was wrong here with the ranch with you with NellBelding that ditch there is dry
The roses are dead
The little green in that grass has come with the rains
Whats happened
The ranchs run down
Now I look around I see a change
Some change yes replied Belding bitterly
Listen son
Briefly but not the less forcibly for that Belding related his story of the operations of the Chases
Astonishment appeared to be Gales first feeling
Our water gone our claims gone our plans forestalled
Why Belding its unbelievable
Forlorn River with promoters business railroad bank and what not
Suddenly he became fiery and suspicious
These Chasesdid they do all this on the level
Barefaced robbery
Worse than a Greaser holdup replied Belding grimly
You say the law upheld them
Sure
Why Ben Chase has a pull as strong as Diablos on a down grade
Dick were jobbed outfigured beat tricked and we cant do a thing
Oh Im sorry Belding most of all for Laddy said Gale feelingly
Hes all in
Hell never ride again
He wanted to settle down here on the farm he thought he owned grow grass and raise horses and take it easy
Oh but its tough
Say he doesnt know it yet
He was just telling me hed like to go out and look the farm over
Whos going to tell him
Whats he going to do when he finds out about this deal
Son thats make me think some replied Belding with keen eyes fast upon the young man
And I was kind of wondering how youd take it
I
Well Ill call on the Chases
Look here Belding Id better do some forestalling myself
If Laddy gets started now therell be blood spilled
Hes not just right in his mind yet
He talks in his sleep sometimes about how Yaqui finished Rojas
If its left to himhell kill these men
But if I take it up Youre talking sense Dick
Only here Im not so sure of you
And theres more to tell
Son youve Nell to think of and your mother
Beldings ranger gave him a long and searching glance
You can be sure of me he said
All right then listen began Belding
With deep voice that had many a beak and tremor he told Gale how Nell had been hounded by Radford Chase how her mother had been driven by Ben Chasethe whole sad story
So thats the trouble
Poor little girl
murmured Gale brokenly
I felt something was wrong
Nell wasnt natural like her old self
And when I begged her to marry me soon while Dad was here she couldnt talk
She could only cry
It was hard on Nell said Belding simply
But it ll be better now youre back
Dick I know the girl
Shell refuse to marry you and youll have a hard job to break her down as hard as the one you just rode in off of
I think I know you too or I wouldnt be saying Belding what re you hinting at
demanded Gale
Do you dare insinuate thatthatif the thing were true itd make any difference to me
Aw come now Dick I couldnt mean that
Im only awkward at saying things
And Im cut pretty deep For Gods dake you dont believe what Chase said
queried Gale in passionate haste
Its a lie
I swear its a lie
I know its a lie
And Ive got to tell Nell this minute
Come on in with me
I want you Belding
Oh why didnt you tell me sooner
Belding felt himself dragged by an iron arm into the sittingroom out into the patio and across that to where Nell sat in her door
At sight of them she gave a little cry drooped for an instant then raised a pale still face with eyes beginning to darken
Dearest I know now why you are not wearing my mothers ring said Gale steadily and lowvoiced
Dick I am not worthy she replied and held out a trembling hand with the ring lying in the palm
Swift as light Gale caught her hand and slipped the ring back upon the third finger
Nell
Look at me
It is your engagement ringListen
I dont believe thisthis thing thats been torturing you
I know its a lie
I am absolutely sure your mother will prove it a lie
She must have suffered onceperhaps there was a sad errorbut the thing you fear is not true
But hear me dearest even if it was true it wouldnt make the slightest difference to me
Id promise you on my honor Id never think of it again
Id love you all the more because youd suffered
I want you all the more to be my wifeto let me make you forgetto She rose swiftyly with the passionate abandon of a woman stirred to her depths and she kissed him
Oh Dick youre goodso good
Youll never knowjust what those words mean to me
Theyve saved meI think
Then dearest its all right
Dick questioned eagerly
You will keep your promise
You will marry me
The glow the light faded out of her face and now the blue eyes were almost black
She drooped and shook her head
Nell
exclaimed Gale sharply catching his breath
Dont ask me Dick
II wont marry you
Why
You know
Its true that I Its a lie interrupted Gale fiercely
But even if its truewhywhy wont you marry me
Between you and me love is the thing
Love and nothing else
Dont you love me any more
They had forgotten Belding who stepped back into the shade
I love you with my whole heart and soul
Id die for you whispered Nell with clenching hands
But I wont disgrace you
Dear you have worried over this trouble till youre morbid
It has grown out of all proportion
I tell you that Ill not only be the happiest man on earth but the luckiest if you marry me
Dick you give not one thought to your family
Would they receive me as your wife
They surely would replied Gale steadily
No
oh no
Youre wrong Nell
Im glad you said that
You give me a chance to prove something
Ill go this minute and tell them all
Ill be back here in less than Dick you will not tell heryour mother
cried Nell with her eyes streaming
You will not
Oh I cant bear it
Shes so proud
And Dick I love her
Dont tell her
Please please dont
Shell be going soon
She neednt ever knowabout me
I want her always to think well of me
Dick I beg of you
Oh the fear of her knowing has been the worst of all
Please dont go
Nell Im sorry
I hate to hurt you
But youre wrong
You cant see things clearly
This is your happiness Im fighting for
And its my lifeWait here dear
I wont be long
Gale ran across the patio and disappeared
Nell sank to the doorstep and as she met the question in Beldings eyes she shook her head mournfully
They waited without speaking
It seemed a long while before Gale returned
Belding thrilled at sight of him
There was more boy about him than Belding had ever seen
Dick was coming swiftly flushed glowing eager erect almost smiling
I told them
I swore it was a lie but I wanted them to decide as if it were true
I didnt have to waste a minute on Elsie
She loves you Nell
The Governor is crazy about you
I didnt have to waste two minutes on him
Mother used up the time
She wanted to know all there was to tell
She is proud yes but Nell I wish you could have seen how she took thethe story about you
Why she never thought of me at all until she had cried over you
Nell she loves you too
They all love you
Oh its so good to tell you
I think mother realizes the part you have had in thewhat shall I call itthe regeneration of Richard Gale
Doesnt that sound fine
Darling mother not only consents she want you to be my wife
Do you hear that
And listenshe had me in a corner and of course being my mother she put on the screws
She made me promise that wed live in the East half the year
That means Chicago Cape May New Yorkyou see Im not exactly the lost son any more
Why Nell dear youll have to learn who Dick Gale really is
But I always want to be the ranger you helped me become and ride Blanco Sol and see a little of the desert
Dont let the idea of big cities frighten you
Well always love the open places best
Now Nell say youll forget this trouble
I know itll come all right
Say youll marry me soonWhy dearest youre cryingNell
Myheartis broken sobbed Nell forIIcant marry you
The boyish brightness faded out of Gales face
Here Belding saw was the stern reality arrayed against his dreams
That devil Radford Chasehell tell my secret panted Nell
He swore if you ever came back and married me hed follow us all over the world to tell it
Belding saw Gale grow deathly white and suddenly stand stockstill
Chase threatened you then
asked Dick and the forced naturalness of his voice struck Belding
Threatened me
He made my life a nightmare replied Nell in a rush of speech
At first I wondered how he was worrying mother sick
But she wouldnt tell me
Then when she went away he began to hint things
I hated him all the more
But when he told meI was frightened shamed
Still I did not weaken
He was pretty decent when he was sober
But when he was half drunk he was the devil
He laughed at me and my pride
I didnt dare shut the door in his face
After a while he found out that your mother loved me and that I loved her
Then he began to threaten me
If I didnt give in to him hed see she learned the truth
That made me weaken
It nearly killed me
I simply could not bear the thought of Mrs Gale kowing
But I couldnt marry him
Besides he got so half the time when he was drunk he didnt want or ask me to be his wife
I was about ready to give up and go mad when youyou came home
She ended in a whisper looking up wistfully and sadly at him
Belding was a raging fire within cold without
He watched Gale and believed he could foretell that young mans future conduct
Gale gathered Nell up into his arms and held her to his breast for a long moment
Dear Nell Im sure the worst of your trouble is over he said gently
I will not give you up
Now wont you lie down try to rest and calm yourself
Dont grieve any more
This thing isnt so bad as you make it
Trust me
Ill shut Mr Radford Chases mouth
As he released her she glanced quickly up at him then lifted appealing hands
Dick you wont hunt for himgo after him
Gale laughed and the laugh made Belding jump
Dick I beg of you
Please dont make trouble
The Chases have been hard enough on us
They are rich powerful
Dick say you will not make matters worse
Please promise me youll not go to him
You ask me that
he demanded
Yes
Oh yes
But you know its useless
What kind of a man do you want me to be
Its only that Im afraid
Oh Dick hed shoot you in the back
No Nell a man of his kind wouldnt have nerve enough even for that
Youll go
she cried wildly
Gale smiled and the smile made Belding cold
Dick I cannot keep you back
No he said
Then the woman in her burst through instinctive fear and with her eyes blazing black in her white face she lifted parted quivering lips and kissed him
Gale left the patio and Belding followed closely at his heels
They went through the sittingroom
Outside upon the porch sat the rangers Mr Gale and Thorne
Dick went into his room without speaking
Shore somethins comin off said Ladd sharply and he sat up with keen eyes narrowing
Belding spoke a few words and remembering an impression he had wished to make upon Mr Gale he made them strong
But now it was with grim humor that he spoke
Better stop that boy he concluded looking at Mr Gale
Hell do some mischief
Hes wildern hell
Stop him
Why assuredly replied Mr Gale rising with nervous haste
Just then Dick came out of his door
Belding eyed him keenly
The only change he could see was that Dick had put on a hat and a pair of heavy gloves
Richard where are you going
asked his father
Im going over here to see a man
No
It is my wish that you remain
I forbid you to go said Mr Gale with a hand on his sons shoulder
Dick put Mr Gale aside gently respectfully yet forcibly
The old man gasped
Dad I havent gotten over my bad habit of disobeying you
Im sorry
Dont interfere with me now
And dont follow me
You might see something unpleasant
But my son
What are you going to do
Im going to beat a dog
Mr Gale looked helplessly from this strangely calm and cold son to the restless Belding
Then Dick strode off the porch
Hold on
Ladds voice would have stopped almost any man
Dick you wasnt agoin without me
Yes I was
But Im thoughtless just now Laddy
Shore you was
Wait a minute Dick
Im a sick man but at that nobody can pull any stunts round here without me
He hobbled along the porch and went into his room
Jim Lash knocked the ashes out of his pipe and humming his dance tune he followed Ladd
In a moment the rangers appeared and both were packing guns
Not a little of Beldings grim excitement came from observation of Mr Gale
At sight of the rangers with their guns the old man turned white and began to tremble
Better stay behind whispered Belding
Dicks going to beat that twolegged dog and the rangers get excited when theyre packing guns
I will not stay behind replied Mr Gale stoutly
Ill see this affair through
Belding Ive guessed it
Richard is going to fight the Chases those robbers who have ruined you
Well I cant guarantee any fight on their side returned Belding dryly
But maybe therell be Greasers with a gun or two
Belding stalked off to catch up with Dick and Mr Gale came trudging behind with Thorne
Where will we find these Chases
asked Dick of Belding
Theyve got a place down the road adjoining the inn
They call it their club
At this hour Radford will be there sure
I dont know about the old man
But his office is now just across the way
They passed several houses turned a corner into the main street and stopped at a wide low adobe structure
A number of saddled horses stood haltered to posts
Mexicans lolled around the wide doorway
Theres Ben Chase now over on the corner said Belding to Dick
See the tall man with the white hair and leather band on his hat
He sees us
He knows theres something up
Hes got men with him
Theyll come over
Were after the young buck and sure hell be in here
They entered
The place was a hall and needed only a bar to make it a saloon
There were two rickety pool tables
Evidently Chase had fitted up this amusement room for his laborers as well as for the use of his engineers and assistants for the crowd contained both Mexicans and Americans
A large table near a window was surrounded by a noisy smoking drinking circle of cardplayers
Point out this Radford Chase to me said Gale
There
The big fellow with the red face
His eyes stick out a little
See
Hes dropped his cards and his face isnt red any more
Dick strode across the room
Belding grasped Mr Gale and whispered hoarsely Dont miss anything
It ll be great
Watch Dick and watch Laddy
If theres any gun play dodge behind me
Belding smiled with a grim pleasure as he saw Mr Gales face turn white
Dick halted beside the table
His heavy boot shot up and with a crash the table split and glasses cards chips flew everywhere
As they rattled down and the chairs of the dumfounded players began to slide Dick called out My name is Gale
Im looking for Mr Radford Chase
A tall heavyshouldered fellow rose boldly enough even swaggeringly and glowered at Gale
Im Radford Chase he said
His voice betrayed the boldness of his action
It was over in a few moments
The tables and chairs were tumbled into a heap one of the pool tables had been shoved aside a lamp lay shattered with oil running dark upon the floor
Ladd leaned against a post with a smoking gun in his hand
A Mexican crouched close to the wall moaning over a broken arm
In the far corner upheld by comrades another wounded Mexican cried out in pain
These two had attempted to draw weapons upon Gale and Ladd had crippled them
In the center of the room lay Radford Chase a limp torn hulking bloody figure
He was not seriously injured
But he was helpless a miserable beaten wretch who knew his condition and felt the eyes upon him
He sobbed and moaned and howled
But no one offered to help him to his feet
Backed against the door of the hall stood Ben Chase for once stripped of all authority and confidence and courage
Gale confronted him and now Gales mien was in striking contrast to the coolness with which he had entered the place
Though sweat dripped from his face it was as white as chalk
Like dark flames his eyes seemed to leap and dance and burn
His lean jaw hung down and quivered with passion
He shook a huge gloved fist in Chases face
Your gray hairs save you this time
But keep out of my way
And when that son of yours comes to tell him every time I meet him Ill add some more to what he got today
XIX The Secret of Forlorn River In the early morning Gale seeking solitude where he could brood over his trouble wandered alone
It was not easy for him to elude the Yaqui and just at the moment when he had cast himself down in a secluded shady corner the Indian appeared noiseless shadowy mysterious as always
Malo he said in his deep voice
Yes Yaqui its badvery bad replied Gale
The Indian had been told of the losses sustained by Belding and his rangers
Gome
said Yaqui with an impressive gesture toward the lofty lilaccolored steps of No Name Mountains
He seemed the same as usual but a glance on Gales part a moments attention made him conscious of the old strange force in the Yaqui
Why does my brother want me to climb the nameless mountains with him
asked Gale
Lluvia doro replied Yaqui and he made motions that Gale found difficult of interpretation
Shower of Gold translated Gale
That was the Yaquis name for Nell
What did he mean by using it in connection with a climb into the mountains
Were his motions intended to convey an idea of a shower of golden blossoms from that rare and beautiful tree or a golden rain
Gales listlessness vanished in a flash of thought
The Yaqui meant gold
Gold
He meant he could retrieve the fallen fortunes of the white brother who had saved his life that evil day at the Papago Well
Gale thrilled as he gazed piercingly into the wonderful eyes of this Indian
Would Yaqui never consider his debt paid
Gome
repeat the Indian pointing with the singular directness that always made this action remarkable in him
Yes Yaqui
Gale ran to his room put on hobnailed boots filled a canteen and hurried back to the corral
Yaqui awaited him
The Indian carried a coiled lasso and a short stout stick
Without a word he led the way down the lane turned up the river toward the mountains
None of Beldings household saw their departure
What had once been only a narrow mesquitebordered trail was now a welltrodden road
A deep irrigation ditch full of flowing muddy water ran parallel with the road
Gale had been curious about the operations of the Chases but bitterness he could not help had kept him from going out to see the work
He was not surprised to find that the engineers who had contructed the ditches and dam had anticipated him in every particular
The dammedup gulch made a magnificent reservoir and Gale could not look upon the long narrow lake without a feeling of gladness
The dreaded ano seco of the Mexicans might come again and would come but never to the inhabitants of Forlorn River
That stonewalled stonefloored gulch would never leak and already it contained water enough to irrigate the whole Altar Valley for two dry seasons
Yaqui led swiftly along the lake to the upper end where the stream roared down over unscalable walls
This point was the farthest Gale had ever penetrated into the rough foothills and he had Beldings word for it that no white man had ever climbed No Name Mountains from the west
But a white man was not an Indian
The former might have stolen the range and valley and mountain even the desert but his possessions would ever remain mysteries
Gale had scarcely faced the great gray ponderous wall of cliff before the old strange interest in the Yaqui seized him again
It recalled the tie that existed between them a tie almost as close as blood
Then he was eager and curious to see how the Indian would conquer those seemingly insurmountable steps of stone
Yaqui left the gulch and clambered up over a jumble of weathered slides and traced a slow course along the base of the giant wall
He looked up and seemed to select a point for ascent
It was the last place in that mountainside where Gale would have thought climbing possible
Before him the wall rose leaning over him shutting out the light a dark mighty mountain mass
Innumerable cracks and crevices and caves roughened the bulging sides of dark rock
Yaqui tied one end of his lasso to the short stout stick and carefully disentangling the coils he whirled the stick round and round and threw it almost over the first rim of the shelf perhaps thirty feet up
The stick did not lodge
Yaqui tried again
This time it caught in a crack
He pulled hard
Then holding to the lasso he walked up the steep slant hand over hand on the rope
When he reached the shelf he motioned for Gale to follow
Gale found that method of scaling a wall both quick and easy
Yaqui pulled up the lasso and threw the stick aloft into another crack
He climbed to another shelf and Gale followed him
The third effort brought them to a more rugged bench a hundred feet above the slides
The Yaqui worked round to the left and turned into a dark fissure
Gale kept close to his heels
They came out presently into lighter space yet one that restricted any extended view
Broken sections of cliff were on all sides
Here the ascent became toil
Gale could distance Yaqui going downhill on the climb however he was hard put to it to keep the Indian in sight
It was not a question of strength or lightness of foot
These Gale had beyond the share of most men
It was a matter of lung power and the Yaquis life had been spent scaling the desert heights
Moreover the climbing was infinitely slow tedious dangerous
On the way up several times Gale imagined he heard a dull roar of falling water
The sound seemed to be under him over him to this side and to that
When he was certain he could locate the direction from which it came then he heard it no more until he had gone on
Gradually he forgot it in the physical sensations of the climb
He burned his hands and knees
He grew hot and wet and winded
His heart thumped so that it hurt and there were instants when his sight was blurred
When at last he had toiled to where the Yaqui sat awaiting him upon the rim of that great wall it was none too soon
Gale lay back and rested for a while without note of anything except the blue sky
Then he sat up
He was amazed to find that after that wonderful climb he was only a thousand feet or so above the valley
Judged by the nature of his effort he would have said he had climbed a mile
The village lay beneath him with its new adobe structures and tents and buildings in bright contrast with the older habitations
He saw the green alfalfa fields and Beldings white horses looking very small and motionless
He pleased himself by imagining he could pick out Blanco Sol
Then his gaze swept on to the river
Indeed he realized now why some one had named it Forlorn River
Even at this season when it was full of water it had a forlorn aspect
It was doomed to fail out there on the desertdoomed never to mingle with the waters of the Gulf
It wound away down the valley growing wider and shallower encroaching more and more on the gray flats until it disappeared on its sad journey toward Sonoyta
That vast shimmering sungoverned waste recognized its life only at this flood season and was already with parched tongue and insatiate fire licking and burning up its futile waters
Yaqui put a hand on Gales knww
It was a bronzed scarred powerful hand always eloquent of meaning
The Indian was listening
His bent head his strange dilating eyes his rigid form and that closepressing hand how these brought back to Gale the terrible lonely night hours on the lava
What do you hear Yaqui
asked Gale
He laughed a little at the mood that had come over him
But the sound of his voice did not break the spell
He did not want to speak again
He yielded to Yaquis subtle nameless influence
He listened himself heard nothing but the scream of an eagle
Often he wondered if the Indian could hear things that made no sound
Yaqui was beyond understanding
Whatever the Indian had listened to or for presently he satisfied himself and with a grunt that might mean anything he rose and turned away from the rim
Gale followed rested now and eager to go on
He saw that they great cliff they had climbed was only a stairway up to the huge looming dark bulk of the plateau above
Suddenly he again heard the dull roar of falling water
It seemed to have cleared itself of muffled vibrations
Yaqui mounted a little ridge and halted
The next instant Gale stood above a bottomless cleft into which a white stream leaped
His astounded gaze swept backward along this narrow swift stream to its end in a dark round boiling pool
It was a huge spring a bubbling well the outcropping of an underground river coming down from the vast plateau above
Yaqui had brought Gale to the source of Forlorn River
Flashing thoughts in Gales mind were no swifter than the thrills that ran over him
He would stake out a claim here and never be cheated out of it
Ditches on the benches and troughs on the steep walls would carry water down to the valley
Ben Chase had build a great dam which would be useless if Gale chose to turn Forlorn River from its natural course
The fountain head of that mysterious desert river belonged to him
His eagerness his mounting passion was checked by Yaquis unusual actins
The Indian showed wonder hesitation even reluctance
His strange eyes surveyed this boiling well as if they could not believe the sight they saw
Gale divined instantly that Yaqui had never before seen the source of Forlorn River
If he had ever ascended to this plateau probably it had been to some other part for the water was new to him
He stood gazing aloft at peaks at lower ramparts of the mountain and at nearer landmarks of prominence
Yaqui seemed at fault
He was not sure of his location
Then he strode past the swirling pool of dark water and began to ascend a little slope that led up to a shelving cliff
Another object halted the Indian
It was a pile of stones weathered crumbled fallen into ruin but still retaining shape enough to prove it had been built there by the hands of men
Round and round this the Yaqui stalked and his curiosity attested a further uncertainty
It was as if he had come upon something surprising
Gale wondered about the pile of stones
Had it once been a prospectors claim
Ugh
grunted the Indian and though his exclamation expressed no satisfaction it surely put an end to doubt
He pointed up to the roof of the sloping yellow shelf of stone
Faintly outlined there in red were the imprints of many human hands with fingers spread wide
Gale had often seen such paintings on the walls of the desert caverns
Manifestly these told Yaqui he had come to the spot for which he had aimed
Then his actions became swiftand Yaqui seldom moved swiftly
The fact impressed Gale
The Indian searched the level floor under the shelf
He gathered up handfuls of small black stones and thrust them at Gale
Their weight made Gale start and then he trembled
The Indians next move was to pick up a piece of weathered rock and throw it against the wall
It broke
He snatched up parts and showed the broken edges to Gale
They contained yellow steaks dull glints faint tracings of green
It was gold
Gale found his legs shaking under him and he sat down trying to take all the bits of stone into his lap
His fingers were all thumbs as with knife blade he dug into the black pieces of rock
He found gold
Then he stared down the slope down into the valley with its river winding forlornly away into the desert
But he did not see any of that
Here was reality as sweet as wonderful as saving as a dream come true
Yaqui had led him to a ledge of gold
Gale had learned enough about mineral to know that this was a rich strike
All in a second he was speechless with the joy of it
But his mind whirled in thought about this strange and noble Indian who seemed never to be able to pay a debt
Belding and the poverty that had come to him
Nell who had wept over the loss of a spring
Laddy who never could ride again
Jim Lash who swore he would always look after his friend
Thorne and Mercedes
All these people who had been good to him and whom he loved were poor
But now they would be rich
They would one and all be his partners
He had discovered the source of Forlorn River and was rich in water
Yaqui had made him rich in gold
Gale wanted to rush down the slope down into the valley and tell his wonderful news
Suddenly his eyes cleared and he saw the pile of stones
His blood turned to ice then to fire
That was the mark of a prospectors claim
But it was old very old
The ledge had never been worked
the slope was wild
There was not another single indication that a prospector had ever been there
Where then was he who had first staked this claim
Gale wondered with growing hope with the fire easing with the cold passing
The Yaqui uttered the low strange involuntary cry so rare with him a cry somehow always associated with death
Gale shuddered
The Indian was digging in the sand and dust under the shelving wall
He threw out an object that rang against the stone
It was a belt buckle
He threw out old shrunken withered boots
He came upon other things and then he ceased to dig
The grave of desert prospectors
Gale had seen more than one
Ladd had told him many a story of such gruesome finds
It was grim hard fact
Then the keeneyed Yaqui reached up to a little projecting shelf of rock and took from it a small object
He showed no curiosity and gave the thing to Gale
How strangely Gale felt when he received into his hands a flat oblong box
Was it only the influence of the Yaqui or was there a nameless and unseen presence beside that grave
Gale could not be sure
But he knew he had gone back to the old desert mood
He knew something hung in the balance
No accident no luck no debtpaying Indian could account wholly for that moment
Gale knew he held in his hands more than gold
The box was a tin one and not all rusty
Gale pried open the reluctant lid
A faint old musty odor penetrated his nostrils
Inside the box lay a packet wrapped in what once might have been oilskin
He took it out and removed this covering
A folded paper remained in his hands
It was growing yellow with age
But he descried a dim tracery of words
A crabbed scrawl written in blood hard to read
He held it more to the light and slowly he deciphered its content
We Robert Burton and Jonas Warren give half of this gold claim to the man who finds it and half to Nell Burton daughter and granddaughter
Gasping with a bursting heart ovewhelmed by an unutterable joy of divination Gale fumbled with the paper until he got it open
It was a certificate twentyone years old and recorded the marriage of Robert Burton and Nellie Warren
XX Desert Gold A summer day dawned on Forlorn River a beautiful still hot golden day with huge sail clouds of white motionless over No Name Peaks and the purple of clear air in the distance along the desert horizon
Mrs Belding returned that day to find her daughter happy and the past buried forever in two lonely graves
The haunting shadow left her eyes
Gale believed he would never forget the sweetness the wonder the passion of her embrace when she called him her boy and gave him her blessing
The little wrinkled padre who married Gale and Nell performed the ceremoney as he told his beads without interest or penetration and went his way leaving happiness behind
Shore I was a sick man Ladd said an darn near a dead one but Im agoin to get well
Mebbe Ill be able to ride again someday
Nell I lay it to you
An Im agoin to kiss you an wish you all the joy there is in this world
An Dick as Yaqui says shes shore your Shower of Gold
He spoke of Gales finding lovespoke of it with the deep and wistful feeling of the lonely ranger who had always yearned for love and had never known it
Belding once more practical and important as never before with mining projects and water claims to manage spoke of Gales great good fortune in finding of goldhe called it desert gold
Ah yes
Desert Gold
exclaimed Dicks father softly with eyes of pride
Perhaps he was glad Dick had found the rich claim surely he was happy that Dick had won the girl he loved
But it seemed to Dick himself that his father meant something very different from love and fortune in his allusion to desert gold
That beautiful happy day like life or love itself could not be wholly perfect
Yaqui came to Dick to say goodby
Dick was startled grieved and in his impulsiveness forgot for a moment the nature of the Indian
Yaqui was not to be changed
Belding tried to overload him with gifts
The Indian packed a bag of food a blanket a gun a knife a canteen and no more
The whole household went out with him to the corrals and fields from which Belding bade him choose a horseany horse even the loved Blanco Diablo
Gales heart was in his throat for fear the Indian might choose Blanco Sol and Gale hated himself for a selfishness he could not help
But without a word he would have parted with the treasured Sol
Yaqui whistled the horses upfor the last time
Did he care for them
It would have been hard to say
He never looked at the fierce and haughty Diablo nor at Blanco Sol as he raised his noble head and rang his piercing blast
The Indian did not choose one of Beldings whites
He caught a lean and wiry broncho strapped a blanket on him and fastened on the pack
Then he turned to these friends the same emotionless inscrutable dark and silent Indian that he had always been
This parting was nothing to him
He had stayed to pay a debt and now he was going home
He shook hands with the men swept a dark fleeting glance over Nell and rested his strange eyes upon Mercedess beautiful and agitated face
It must have been a moment of intense feeling for the Spanish girl
She owed it to him that she had life and love and happiness
She held out those speaking slender hands
But Yaqui did not touch them
Turning away he mounted the broncho and rode down the trail toward the river
Hes going home said Belding
Home
whispered Ladd and Dick knew the ranger felt the resurging tide of memory
Homeacross the cactus and lava through solemn lonely days the silent lonely nights into the vast and redhazed world of desolation
Thorne Mercedes Nell lets climb the foothill yonder and watch him out of sight said Dick
They climbed while the others returned to the house
When they reached the summit of the hill Yaqui was riding up the far bank of the river
He will turn to lookto wave goodby
asked Nell
Dear he is an Indian replied Gale
From that height they watched him ride through the mesquites up over the river bank to enter the cactus
His mount showed dark against the green and white and for a long time he was plainly in sight
The sun hung red in a golden sky
The last the watchers saw of Yaqui was when he rode across a ridge and stood silhouetted against the gold of desert skya wild lonely beautiful picture
Then he was gone
Strangely it came to Gale then that he was glad
Yaqui had returned to his ownthe great spaces the desolation the solitudeto the trails he had trodden when a child trails haunted now by ghosts of his people and ever by his gods
Gale realized that in the Yaqui he had known the spirit of the desert that this spirit had claimed all which was wild and primitive in him
Tears glistened in Mercedess magnificent black eyes and Thorne kissed them awaykissed the fire back to them and the flame to her cheeks
That action recalled Gales earlier mood the joy of the present and he turned to Nells sweet face
The desert was there wonderful constructive ennobling beautiful terrible but it was not for him as it was for the Indian
In the light of Nells tremulous returning smile that strange deep clutching shadow faded lost its hold forever and he leaned close ot her whispering Lluvia doro Shower of Gold
