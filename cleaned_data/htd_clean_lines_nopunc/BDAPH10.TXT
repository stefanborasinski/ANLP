I stopped swinging my legs and looked at her
Did you indeed
I said coldly
My sister nodded dreamily
Then you lied darling
In your white throat I said pleasantly
By the way dyou know if the petrols come
I dont even care said Daphne
But I didnt lie old chap
My word is  Your bond
Quite so
But not mine
The appointment I have in Town that day Which day
said Daphne with a faint smile
The fete day
Ah
It was a bazaar fete thing
Daphne and several others  euphemistically styled workers had conspired and agreed together to obtain money by false pretences for and on behalf of a certain mission to wit the Banana
I prefer to put it that way
There is a certain smack about the wording of an indictment
Almost a relish
The fact that two years before I had been let in for a stall and had defrauded fellow men and women of a considerable sum of money but strengthened my determination not to be entrapped again
At the same time I realized that I was up against it
The crime in question was fixed for Wednesday or Thursdayso much I knew
But no more
There was the rub
I really could not toil up to Town two days running
Lets see I said carelessly the fetes on er Wednesday or Thursday is it
Which day are you going up to Town
said Daphne
I changed my ground
The Bananas are all right I said lighting a cigarette
They only ate a missionary the other day said my sister
Thats bad said I musingly
To any nation the consumption of home produce is of vital  We want to make sixty pounds
To go towards their next meal
How much do missionaries cost
To save their souls alive said Daphne zealously
Im glad somethings to be saved alive said I
Before she could reply tea began to appear
When the footman had retired to fetch the second instalment of accessories I pointed the finger of scorn at the table upon which he had set the tray
That parody emanated from a bazaar I said contemptuously
It does for the garden said my sister
Itd do for anything said I 
Its silly sides its crazy legs Crazy
cried Daphne indignantly
Itd bear an elephant
What if it would
I said severely
Its months since we gave up the elephants
Is the kettle ready
It boils not neither does it sing
For which piece of irreverence you will do something on Thursday
My dear girl I said hurriedly  if it were not imperative for me to be in Town  You will do something on Thursday
I groaned
And this I said this is my mothers daughter
We have been nursed together scolded together dandled in the same arms
If she had not been the stronger of the two we should have played with the same toys
I groaned again
Berry opened his eyes
The value of a siesta upon a summer afternoon  he began
I cut in with a bitter laugh
Whats he going to do
I said
Take a stall of course said Daphne
Is he
said Berry comfortably
Is he
If motoring with Jonah to Huntercombe and playing golf all day is not incompatible with taking a stall on Thursday I will sell childrens underwear and egg cosies with eclat
Otherwise  Golf I said golf
Why dont I play golf
I know said Berry because  Miserable man
said Daphne
Who
said her husband
You
Berry turned to me
You hear
he said 
Vulgar abuse
And why
Simply because a previous engagement denies to me the opportunity of subscribing to this charitable imposition
Humble as would have been my poor assistance it would have been rendered with a willing heart
But there
he sighed  It may not be
The Bananas will never know never realize how By the way who are the Bananas
The Bananas
said I
Surely you know the  Werent at Ascot were they
Not in the Enclosure
No
The bold bad Bananas are in many ways an engaging race
Indeed some of the manners and customs which they affect are of a quite peculiar interest
Let us look brother for a moment at their clothing
At the first blush I use the word advisedly it would seem that like the fruit from which they take their name  I thought youd better do some tricks said Daphne throwing a dark look in my direction
Of course I said the very thing
Ive always been so good at tricks
I mean it said Daphne
Of course you do
What about the confidence trick
Can any lady oblige me with a publichouse
She means trickcycling stupid said Berry
Riding backwards on one wheel while you count the ballbearings
Look here I said if Berry could have come and smoked a cigarette I wouldnt have minded trying to flick the ash off it with a huntingwhip
Pity about that golf mused Berry
And you might have thrown knives round me afterwards
As it is youll have to recite
In a few telling sentences I intimated that I would do nothing of the kind
I will appear I said at last I will appear and run round generally but I promise nothing more
Nonsense said my sister
I have promised and Im not going to let you break my word
You are going to do something definite
Desperate
Definite
You have three days in which to get ready
Theres Jill calling me
Were going to run over to Barley to whip up the Ashton crowd
Dyou think weve enough petrol
I dont even care said I Daphne laughed softly
Then I must go she said getting up
Give me a cigarette and tell me if you think this dressll do
Im going to change my shoes
If said I producing my cigarettecase if you were half as nice as you invariably look  Thats a dear she said taking a cigarette
And now goodbye
I watched her retreating figure gloomily
Berry began to recite We are Seven
Thursday morning broke cloudless and brilliant
I saw it break
Reluctantly of course I am not in the habit of rising at cockcrow
But on this occasion I rose because I could not sleep
When I went to bed on Wednesday night I lay awake thinking deeply about what I was to do on the morrow
Daphne had proved inexorable
My brain usually so fertile had become barren and for my three days contemplation of the subject I had absolutely nothing to show
It was past midnight before I fell into a fitful slumber only to be aroused three hours and a half later by the sudden burst of iniquity with which two or more cats saw fit to shake the silence of the rosegarden
As I threw out the bootjack I noticed the dawn
And as further sleep seemed out of the question I decided to dress and go out into the woods
When I slipped out of Knights Bottom into the sunlit road to find myself face to face with a Punch and Judy show I was not far from being momentarily disconcerted
For a second it occurred to me that I might be dreaming but though I listened carefully I could hear no cats so I sat down on the bank by the side of the road and prepared to contemplate the phenomenon
When I say Punch and Judy show I am wrong
Although what I saw suggested the proximity of a Punch and a Judy to say nothing of the likelihood of a show I did not as a matter of fact descry any one of the three
The object that presented itself to my view was the tall rectangular booth gaudy and widemouthed with which until a few years ago the streets of London were so familiar
Were
Dear old Punch and Judy how quickly you are becoming a thing of the past
How soon you will have gone the way of Jackithe Green Peppers Ghost the Maypole and many another old friend
Out of the light into the darkness
The old order changeth yielding place to new and in a little space men shall be content to wonder at your ancient memory as their grandfathers marvelled at that of the frolics of my Lord of Misrule
However
There was the booth
But that was all
It stood quite alone at the side of the white road
I walked round it
Nothing
I glanced up and down the road but there was no one in sight
I had been feeling hungry for it was seven oclock but this was better than breakfast and I returned to the bank
The little red curtains fluttered as a passing breeze caught them and I marked how bright and new they looked
It was certainly in good condition this booth
Well
said a voice
Well
said I
A pause
A girls voice it was coming from within the booth
You seem rather surprised said the voice
No no I said not really surprised
Only a little staggered
You see I know so few booths
What are you doing here
To be frank booth Im waiting
Im waiting too
So
said I
I wait you wait let us wait ye shall have been about to see they would  What are you waiting for
Developments
And you
My breakfast
I looked up and down the road
I dont see it coming I said anxiously
Whats it look like
Milk
You dont happen to have any I suppose
I felt in my pockets
There now I said I must have left it on the piano
I got up rather hurriedly this morning I added apologetically
Never mind
Ill tell you what booth Ill go and get some
No thanks very much
Dont you bother itll come along presently
Are you sure
This isnt The Blue Bird
Yes its all right really
There was another pause
Then Hadnt you better be getting back to breakfast
said the girl
Not much said I
I dont run up against booths every day
Besides  Besides what
Well booth Im awfully curious
What do you want to know
Youre very good
I didnt say Id tell you
Ill risk that
In a word why are you
Ah
I waited in silence for a few moments
At length Suppose she said slowly suppose a bet had been made
A bet
A bet
Shocking
Go on
Well
Isnt that enough
Nothing like
I dont think much of your imagination
I raised my eyes to heaven
A prophet is not without honour I quoted
Is this your own country
It is
Oh I say youd be the very man
I am I said
Refuse substitutes
It gradually appeared that in a rash moment she had made some silly wager that she could give a Punch and Judy show on her own in the village of Lynn Hammer and the vicinity
Of course she had not meant it
She had spoken quite idly secure in the very impracticability of the thing
But certain evildisposed persons referred to mysteriously as theyhad fastened greedily upon her words and waving aside her objection that she had no paraphernalia deliberately proceeded to provide the same that she might have no excuse
The booth was run up the puppets procured
The gentle hint that she wanted to withdraw had been let fall at the exact moment with deadly effect and the wicked work was done
She had been motored over and here set down complete with booth half an hour ago
They were going to look back later just to see how she was getting on
The ordeal was to be over and the wager won by six oclock and she might have the assistance of a native in her whimsical venture
Right up to the last I believe the brutes thought I would cry off she said
I very nearly did too when it came to it
Only I saw Peter smiling
It is rather a hopeless position isnt it
It was
But now that youve got your native  Oh
she said
Then But Ive got one
Where
Hes getting the milk
I dont believe he is
Anyway you can discharge him and take me on
Ive been out of work for years
Besides youve been sent
In your advent I descry the finger of Providence
I wish I did
What do you mean
This day I said I am perforce a zealot
A what
A zealot a Banana zealot
You too shall be a zealot
We will unite our zeal and this day light such a candle  The mans mad she said
Quite mad
I explained
You see I said its like this
Simply miles away somewhere south south and by south of us there are a lot of heathen
Theyre called Bananas
I dont know very much about it but there seems to be a sort of understanding that we should keep them in missionaries
So every now and then the worker push here get up a fete thing and take money off people
Then they find one and send him out
Well theres one of these stunts on this afternoon and Ive been let in to do something
Thats why I look so pale and interesting
The last day or two Ive been desperate about it
But now Now what
If youd let me help you today we could take the show to the fete and simply rake it in
Its a splendid way of winning your bet too
Oh booth isnt it obvious that youve been sent
It certainly would be nicer than giving performances about the village she said musingly
If only I knew you  You dont know the fellow who isnt getting the milk I objected
Thats different
Hed be only a servant
I would be the same
There was a pause
A rabbit loped into the road and blinked curiously at the booth
Then he saw me and beat a hasty retreat
It is in a good cause I urged
You dont know the Bananas theyre absurdly er straight
Its all very well for you she said you know everybody here
But it would be an impossible position for me I dont know a soul
Now if we were both strangers  Well
Well then they wouldnt worry as to who we were and what we had to do with one another
Then lets both be strangers
How can you be strange to order
 Hush
I said
I will disguise me
At home I have put away a Pierrot dress not one of them knows anything about and I think I can raise a mask
If I  A stifled exclamation from the booth made me look up
Framed in its mouth her arms folded and resting on the ledge was the girl
What I could see of her was dressed as a Pierrot
Her hair was concealed under a black silk cap and the familiar white felt conical hat sat jauntily over one ear
A straight white nose and a delicate chin red lips parted and smiling a little such a smile as goes always with eyebrows just raised very alluring so much only I saw
For the rest a strip of black velvet made an irritating mask
I made her a low bow
I can see this is going to be a big thing I said  Wont you come down
I havent even said Ill take you Please
Youre sure to be recognized and then what about me
Oh no I shant
If necessary Ill wear a false nose
Ive got one somewhere
Heres my milk
I looked round and beheld a small boy approaching with a jug
Was that the best you could do in the native line
You neednt sneer
Im not overconfident about my second venture
Well a knaves better than a fool any day
Im sure I hope so
She slipped down out of sight into the booth again to reappear a moment later in the road and by her side a beautiful white bullterrier a Toby ruff about his sturdy neck
Good man said my lady pointing a finger at me
Good man
The dog came forward wagging his tail
I stooped and spoke with him
Then I turned to his mistress
She had discarded her white hat and drawn on a long dustcoat which reached almost to her ankles
She held it close about her as she walked
It showed off her slim figure to great advantage
Below the wide edges of white duck trousers just appeared above shining insteps and high heeled shoes
When the urchin had come up she took the jug from him with both hands
I shall have to drink out of it she said raising it to her lips with a smile
Of course
Why not
Only  I hesitated
What
Hadnt you better I mean wont the mask get in your way
She lowered the jug and looked at me
No it wont get in the way
Thanks all the same she said steadily
Not all today
Its in the way now
Not my way
I saw her eyes watching my face as she drank and when she took the jug from her lips she was smiling
We had some difficulty in persuading the boy to leave us but at length a heavy bribe coupled with the assurance that we should be at the fete in the afternoon had the desired effect and he went slowly away
Thereafter we took counsel together
As a result it was decided that we should fold the booth it shut up like a screen and convey it puppets and all a little way into the wood
It was early yet but some people would be passing along the road and we were not yet ready to combat the curiosity that the appearance of a Punch and Judy show would be sure to arouse
That done she would lie close in the wood with Toby while I made off home and changed
As I started off after settling her in the bracken I heard the village clock strike the halfhour
Halfpast seven
I gained the house unobserved
No one was abroad except the servants but I heard Daphne singing in the bathroom
I had worn the Pierrot dress two years ago at a fancydress ball
There it lay with its mask at the bottom of the wardrobe
The change was soon completed and I stood up a proper Folly from the skull cap upon my crown to the pumps upon my feet
It took some time to find the nose but luck was with me and at last I ran it to earth in an old collarbox
Truly an appalling article it stuck straight out from my face like a fat fiery peg but between that and the mask my disguise would defy detection
Suddenly I had a brilliant idea
Sitting down I scribbled a note to Daphne to the effect that owing to a sleepless night my nerve had forsaken me and that unable to face the terror of the bazaar I had fled to Town and should not be back till late
I added that I should be with her in the spirit which after all was the main thing
I put on a long overcoat and a soft hat
The nose went into one pocket the mask into another
Then I went cautiously downstairs and into the diningroom
It was empty and breakfast was partially laid
In feverish haste I hacked about a pound of meat off a York ham and nearly as much off a new tongue
Wrapping the slices in a napkin I thrust them into the pocket with the nose
To add half a brown loaf to the mask and drain the milk jug was the work of another moment and after laying the note on Daphnes plate I slipped out of the French windows and into the bushes as I heard William come down the passage
A quarter of an hour later I was back again in the wood
She was sitting on a log swinging her legs to and fro
When I took off my coat and hat she clapped her hands in delight
Wait till you see the nose said I
When presently I slipped that French monstrosity into place she laughed so immoderately that her brown hair broke loose from under the black silk cap and tumbled gloriously about her shoulders
There now she said
See what youve done
Good for the nose said I
Its all very well to say that but it took me ages to get it all under the wretched cap this morning
I shouldnt put it back again if I were you
You see I went on earnestly everybody will know youre a girl Judy dear
Why Punch
She drew aside the dust coat and revealed the wide Pierrot trousers she was wearing
Priceless I admitted
But what I really love are your feet
She looked concernedly at her little highheeled shoes
I stooped to flick the dust from their patent leather
Thank you Punch
What shall I do about my hair then
Wear it in a pigtail
Ill plait it for you
Itll be worth another sovereign to the Bananas
If you put it like that she said slowly
I do Judy
If the suggestion was not prompted by motives which were entirely disinterested I think I may be forgiven
I say Judy I said a little later pausing unnecessarily in my work and making pretence to comb with my fingers the tresses as yet ungathered into the plait
Yes
What a long time you are
Well there was a knot
She tried to look round into my face at that but I vigorously unplaited about two inches which seemed to satisfy her
For me I thought of Penelope and her web and the wooers and smiled
Well what is it Punch
About the mask
No good
But Judy  For the next two minutes I did a little listening
When she paused for breath Have some ham I suggested
Bother the ham
Do you hear what I say
I heard you bother the ham
Before that
Something about a mask was it
Give me back my hair she demanded
No no I said hastily not that
I wont ask again
Promise
I promise
When I had finished the plaiting I tied the ends with a piece of ribbon which she produced kissed them and sat down in the grass at her feet
We had oceans of time for the fete did not begin till two
But we agreed there must be a rehearsal of some kind
What do you know about yourself Punch
I have a foggy recollection of domestic differences
You used to beat me cruelly
Ah but you had a nagging tongue Judy
I can hear your defiant wootle now
Her lips parted in a smile at the reminiscence and before they closed again she had slipped something between them
The next instant the wood rang with a regular hurricane of toots and wootles
Oh Judy
Wootle
she said inquiringly
Rather
But hush youll wake the echoes
And why not
They ought to be up and about by now
I shook my head
Theyre a sleepy folk I said they get so little rest
The day is noisy enough but at night what with dogs baying the moon and the nightjars calling when owls do cry  When owls do cry   and the earnest but mistaken chanticleer they have a rotten time
Poor echoes
And they wake very easily here
Dont they everywhere
Oh no
I know some that are very heavy sleepers
In fact its hopeless to try and wake them without the welkin
The welkin
Yes you make him ring you know
They nearly always hear him
And if they dont the first time you make him ring again
For a little space she laughed helplessly
At last I am an idiot to encourage you
Seriously she added about the little play
Presently by us to be enacted
The plot I said is as follows
Punch has a row with Judy and knocks her out
Laughter
Various wellintentioned and benignant fools look in on Punch to pass the time of day and get very properly knocked out for their pains
Loud and prolonged laughter
This is followed by the sidesplitting incident in which a handy clown not only eludes the thirsty bludgeon but surreptitiously steals the inevitable sausages
Exit clown
Punch already irritated at having missed clown misses sausages and exit in high dudgeon
Reenter Judy followed by sausaged clown who comforts her
Oh Judy
Reenter Punch
Justifiable tussle
Punch sees sausages and begins to find his length
Clown sees stars and exit
Punch knocks out Judy with a left hook
To him gloating enter constable
It seems Judys knockout more serious than usual
Constable suggests that Punch shall go quietly
Punch does not see it and retires to fetch persuader
Constable protests and is persuaded
Laughter
Enter ghost not clear whose ghost but any ghost in a storm
Punch unnerved
Ghost gibbers
Punch more unnerved
Ghost gibbers again
Punch terrified
Exit ghost and enter hangman to whom Punch unstrung by recent encounter with apparition falls an easy prey
Curtain
You bow from the mouth of the booth
I adjust nose and collect money in diminutive tin pail
Hows that
Lovely Punch
But where does Toby dear come in
At the mention of his name the terrier rose and went to her
His mistress stroked his soft head
In the background said I 
Or the offing nautical
I dont think hed better act
Let him be stagedoorkeeper
All right
Now open the puppetbox
It was a nice set of puppets and they were very simple to manipulate
They fitted easily on to the hand the forefinger controlling the head and the thumb and second finger the arms
The old fellows cudgel was a dream
We decided that I had better stick to Punch and Punch alone
For the others she would be answerable
After rehearsing for half an hour we stopped for breakfast
In the absence of cutlery it was a ragged meal but what mattered that
We were for letting the world slip we should neer be younger
People were stirring now
Carts rumbled in the distance and cars sang past on the long white road
Presently came one that slowed and slowed and stopped
It was unfortunate that but a moment before I should have grown impatient of a large piece of crust and thrust it bodily into my mouth
But although articulation at this interesting juncture was out of the question I laid an eloquent hand upon her arm and crowded as much expression as I could into a swollen and distorted visage
She glanced at me and collapsed in silent infectious laughter
And so it happened that while we two conspirators lay shaking in the bracken her friends turned their car wonderingly round and drove slowly back into the village away from her they sought
Another hour and a half of somewhat desultory rehearsal found us wootle perfect and ready for anything
So we laid the puppets by fed Toby with brown bread and tongue and rested against the labours of the afternoon
The time passed quickly enough too quickly
It was a few minutes past one when having adjusted my mask and slid my nose into position I got the booth upon my shoulders and stepped out into the road
Come along I said encouragingly
Im afraid
Oh theres something coming
Nonsense
I wish I hadnt packed that bludgeon
Im nervous Punch
Will you make me drag you along by the hair of your head
Of course itd be in the picture right enough but I rather want two hands for this infernal booth
However let me once get a good grip on that soft pigtail  What again
Ah that was in love Judy
The next second she had joined me on the white highway the faithful Toby a short pace behind her
His not to reason why
A good fellow Toby
It was rather a nervous moment
But in spite of an approaching wagonette she walked bravely beside me with the puppetbox under her arm
The occupants of the vehicle began to evince great curiosity as we drew nearer but their mare caught sight of my nose at the critical moment and provided an opportune diversion
So perish all our enemies
she said with a sigh of relief
Stagefright Judy dear
Youll be all right in a minute
Were bound to excite interest
Its what were for and what we want
Ill keep it going
Give me your wootler
She handed me the reed and I held it ready between my lips
Buck up lass
Ten minutes more and we entered the village
The grounds where the fete was to be holden lay threequarters of a mile further on
The ball was opened by two small errand boys on whose hands as is usual with the breed time was lying heavily
They were engaged in deep converse as we came up and it was only when we were close upon them that they became aware of our presence
For a few seconds they stared at us apparently rooted to the spot and as if they could not believe their good fortune
Then one broke into an explosive bellow of delight while the other ran off squeaking with excitement to find other devils who should share the treasuretrove
But unlike his infamous predecessor he was not content with seven
When he returned it was but as the van of a fastswelling rabble
His erstwhile companion who had been backing steadily in front of me ever since he left and had after a hurried consideration of the respective merits of the booth and the box under Judys arm rejected them both in favour of my nose kept his eyes fastened greedily upon that organ with so desperate an air of concentration that I was quite relieved when he tripped over a brick and fell on his back in the road
And all this time our following grew
The news of our advent had spread like wildfire
Old men and maidens young men and boys the matron and the maid alike came running
Altogether Lynn Hammer was set throbbing with an excitement such as it had not experienced since the bakers assistant was wrongly arrested for petty larceny in 1904
Amongst those who walked close about us candid speculation as to the probable venue of the performance was rife while its style length value etc were all frankly discussed
Many were the questions raised and many the inaccurate explanations accepted as to the reason of our being but though my companion came in for some inevitable discussion I was relieved to find that my panache and a comic peculiarity of gait which I thought it as well from time to time to affect proved usefully diverting
When the crowd had begun to assume considerable proportions Judy had slipped her arm in mine and an answering pressure to my encouraging squeeze told me that she was trying to buck up as well as she could
Good little Judy
It was an ordeal for you but you came through it with flying colours though with a flaming cheek
When we reached the triangular piece of grass that lay in front of the village inn I called a halt with such suddeness as to create great confusion in the swarming ranks that followed in our wake
But while they sorted themselves I slipped the booth off my shoulders gave one long echoing call upon the reed and striking an attitude made ready to address the expectant villagers
After carefully polishing my nose with a silk handkerchief an action which met with instant approval I selected a fat redfaced drayman thanked him and said that mine was a Bass an assertion which found high favour with the more immediate cronies of the gentleman in question
Then I got to work
After dwelling lightly on the renown in which the village of Lynn Hammer was held throughout the countryside not to mention a gallant reference to the wit beauty and mirth which was assembled about me I plunged into a facetious resume of recent local events
This of course came to me easily enough but the crowd only saw therein the lucky ventures of a talkative stranger and roared with merriment at each happy allusion
And so I came to the Bananas
Yes we were for the fete
There should we be the livelong afternoon giving free shows and only afterwards soliciting contribution from such as could afford to give in a good cause
God save the King
Then I called for mine host and after ordering ginger beer for Judy and old ale for myself slapped silver into his hand and begged as many as would so honour her to drink the ladys health
About that there was no difficulty and when I had despatched the original boy who all this while had never wavered in his constancy to my proboscis for a small tin pail I prepared to get my burden once more upon my back
But this was not to be
Four good fellows insisted on constituting themselves boothbearers and the burly drayman gallantly relieved my fair companion of the box of puppets
So we came in state to the grounds where the bazaar was to be held
The parley with the gatekeeper was of short duration for the workers scented money in our admission and with an eye to the Bananas main chance made us quickly welcome
On my explaining our intention to put our efforts at their service and any increment that might result into their pockets their expression of gratitude was quite touching
The entrance fee deterred some and their daily occupation more of those who had formed our kindly escort from following us into the fete but I believe that most of them contrived to return before six oclock
When I think of all that I said and did on that sunny afternoon I get hot all over
I could not go very far wrong during the actual performance but it was afterwards when Judy sat smiling in the mouth of the booth and I went forth pail in hand seeking whom I might devour
I drew my arm familiarly through that of a reluctant curate and walked him smartly up and down discussing volubly the merits of my nose in tones which suggested that I had no roof to my mouth Did a lady protest that she had already contributed I repeated Oh madam
reproachfully and crescendo till the hushmoney was paid while in front of those who affected not to see my outstretched hand I stood as if rooted to the spot
I borrowed the vicars wideawake ostensibly for a conjuring trick and wore it assiduously for the rest of the afternoon and on his demurring to such use I explained in the voice of GPHuntley that it went so well with the nose
In short I played the mountebank to a degree that astonished myself but apparently to some purpose for the money came in properly
The performances went with a bang and when at the conclusion of the playlet I lifted Judy to the rickety shelf so that her head and shoulders were framed in the mouth of the booth it was the signal for a burst of applause
On one of these occasions Its not fair that I should take every call she said looking down at my upturned face
My dear Judy I have my reward
What
Dont I lift you up every time
She laughed pleasedly
Gallant Punch youre easily satisfied
Am I Judy am I
I said gently taking her hand
Yes she said snatching it away 
You are and will be
Go out and get the money
I adjusted my nose thoughtfully
Daphne was of course in great evidence
Anxious to run no unnecessary risk I avoided her when possible and when I did find myself in her proximity I at once indulged in some of my more extravagant behaviour
Wheres your brother
I heard a worker say
Brother
said Daphne bitterly
Coward
And I really thought we should have him this time
Fled to London before we were up this morning thank you
From the amount of food he took with him and the way he took it anyone would have thought he was an escaped convict
Guilty conscience I suppose
One hears a good deal about record flights nowadays but Id back my miserable brother against any aviator
My husbands promised to look in about five if hes back from Huntercombe
Thats something
But theyre a wretched lot
Oh heres one of the Pierrots
I hung the pail on my nose and looked at her
As one of the organizers of the fete she said hastily I must thank you  Nothing doing madam said I in an assumed voice
But Free list entirely suspended madam and I shook the pail mercilessly
A small and grinning crowd had begun to collect so Daphne parted up with a forced smile and I went off chuckling to queer the animals race
Our penultimate performance was over and I was in the midst of my vagaries again when I saw Berry
Unanxious to tempt Providence I retired precipitately to the shelter of the booth
My companion was sitting disconsolately upon the box on which she stood to work her puppets
Is it time for the next show
she said
Not for a quarter of an hour
I sat down at her feet and removed my mask and nose
Im afraid I persuaded your hand last time Judy
You touched it
Let me look
It doesnt show
Let me look
After examining the knuckles carefully I turned my attention to the soft little palm
Obstinacy I said
Obstinacy is clearly indicated by the dimple situate below Saturn and to the right of the wateringpot
She tried to draw it away but I tightened my hold and proceeded with my investigation
A gentle and confiding nature characterized by a penchant for escapade is denoted by the joywheel at the base of Halleys Comet
And so we come to the lifebelt
This my word this is all right
Unrivalled for resistance to damp and wear will last three to six times as long as ordinary paint I mean life of extraordinary durability
Now for the heartline
The expert will here descry a curious mixture of Further investigation she cut short by so determined an attempt at withdrawal that I let her hand go
Oughtnt we to be beginning again
Youre very eager for the last show
No Im not but I want to get it over
Oh Judy
She laid her hand on my shoulder
No Punch no I didnt mean that
Its been great fun
Its sweet of you to say that
Its not
Dont you think Ive liked it
I leaned forward
Dear Judy I said very soon it will be over and we shall go our several ways once more
And if we dont meet as the months and years go by when other cleverer better men walk by your side and glorious days crowd thick about you throw a spare thought to the old time when you were a strolling player and the poor fool you gave the honour of your company
She turned her head away but she did not speak
Youll not forget me Judy
She caught her breath and slipped a hand under her mask for a second
Then Next show Punch she cried
No of course I shant
Youve been very good to me
She was on her feet by now and busily arranging the puppets
I groaned
The next moment she had wound a long call upon the reed which put further converse out of the question
The last performance began
The first quarrel seemed to lack its wonted bitterness
Punch appeared halfhearted and Judy was simply walking through
I glanced at the girl and stroked her pigtail my pigtail
Wootle I said encouragingly 
Wootle wootle
She started at my touch
Then she seemed to remember and flung herself into her part with abandon
When the ghost was on I had a brilliant idea
Leave the hangman out I whispered and put up Judy instead
Well have a reconciliation to finish with
And so to Punch sobered shaking cowering in the corner with his little plaster hands before his face came his poor wife
Oh but she did it well 
Gently timidly bravely she laid a trembling hand upon his shoulder and coaxed his hands from before his frightened eyes then backing stood with outstretched appealing little arms a gesture at once so loving and pathetic that Punch was fain to thrust his sleeve before his eyes and turn his face in shame to the wall
Softly went Judy to him again touched him and waited
And as he turned again to find two little arms stealing about his neck and a poor bare bruised head upon his chest he flung his arms about her with a toot of joy and clasped her in the accepted fashion
Oh very charming
This was greeted with prolonged applause
Hold it I said 
Hold the picture
As she obeyed I slid my left arm about her ready to lift her up
Suddenly Punch became limp and lifeless in his wifes embrace and with my freed right hand I slipped her mask over her forehead smiled into her eyes and kissed them
I promised not to ask again
Punch
So for a moment we two let the world wag
Then the whole booth fell heavily over mouth uppermost and we within it
It was the final of the animal race that was responsible for our overthrow
The black pig blind with jealous rage and mortification at being beaten on the tape by a cochin china had borne violently down upon the booth and upset it with wicked grunts of satisfaction
Hurt dear
said I
No
As she slipped her mask into place Berry put his head in at the mouth of the booth
Maskless noseless I looked at him
Slowly his astonished features relaxed in a grin
So
he said softly
I might have known
CHAPTER II CLOTHES AND THE MAN This said Berry is all right
By which I mean  We assured him we knew what he meant and that no explanation was necessary
All right he said at lastThere
Ive said it again now
Youre quite sure you do know what I mean
Because if youve the least hesitation  Will you be quiet
said Daphne
Alright
It was a beautiful August morning
After a roaring season in town we had all five Berry Daphne Jonah Jill and myself girded our jaded loins packed crawled into the car and rolled down to Cornwall there to build up the wasted tissues go to bed at ten and forget that there were such things as theatres and ballrooms
We took a couple of days coming down by road and our run was not without incident
I wish cyclists would not hang on behind
In Kingston a mongers boy with some fish that were patently feeling the heat took hold of the capehood
I spoke with him after a little
The use of this hood I said for heavy and bulky packages involves risk of injury to passengers and is prohibited
Didnt you know that
He regarded me with a seraphic smile nearly lost his life by getting into a tramline and said I ought to know better than to talk to the man at the wheel
Friend said I I perceive you are a humorist
Lo here in this car are already three humorists
Under these unfortunate circumstances I have no alternative but to ask you to withdraw
It was just then that the near hind tyre burst exactly under him
We gave him half a sovereign towards buying a new bicycle but I believe he will always think we did it on purpose
It had been arranged that we should spend the night at Salisbury and push on to Cornwall on the following day
We made the Cathedral city soon after five and slipped out to see Stonehenge
There were a few other people there and one or two of them turned to watch our arrival
Berry left the car and went straight to the nearest a fat tradesman wearing a new imitation panama and a huge calabash
Can you tell me if this is Stoke Poges
we heard him say
The rest of us alighted and walked hurriedly away in the opposite direction
Clearly my brotherinlaw was in a certain mood and no fit companion for the sensitive
Memories of the unutterable torment to which on like occasions we had been mercilessly subjected by reason of Berrys most shameless behaviour among strangers rose up before us
The fact that he called after us caused Daphne to break into a run
Our luck was out
When we had completed the circle of the cromlechs we came suddenly upon him
More to our dismay than surprise he had become the centre of a little knot of excursionists who were listening to him eagerly
As we appeared Ah he said to the interested company here is my Aunt
Shell tell you
Aunt Daphne wasnt it here that father lost the string bag
Wretched fool
said Daphne under her breath turning hurriedly in the direction of the car
Berry watched her retreat and turned to his listeners with a sigh
Im afraid Ive gone and upset her now he said
I oughtnt to have reminded her of the untoward incident
It was the only string bag they had and it was an awful blow to her
It upset him too terribly
Never the same man again
In fact from that day he began to go wrong criminally I mean
The little group grew closer to him than ever
Like a fool I stayed to hear more
Yes Berry went on in less than a month he was up at the Old Bailey under the Merchandise Marks Act for selling Gruyere cheese with too big holes in it
Five years his sentence was
Lets see he ought to be coming out in about oh about When does father come out Cousin Albert
The excursionists gazed greedily at me the felons son
I approached Berry and laid a hand upon his arm
Then I turned to the little group
This fellow I said has got us into trouble before
Those of you who have motorcars will understand me when I refer to the great difficulty of securing a really trustworthy chauffeur
Now this man is honest and a most careful driver but when he is so to speak off duty he is so unfortunate as to suffer from delusions usually connected with crime and the administration of the criminal law
While we were having lunch at Whitchurch only this afternoon he went off to the policestation and tried to give himself up for the Hounslow murder didnt you
Yes sir faltered Berry
And all the time I went on Im not at all satisfied myself that he did murder the woman although things certainly looked rather black  I did
said Berry fiercely
The crowd of excursionists recoiled and a small boy in a green flannel blazer burst into tears
Any way I said  there isnt anything like enough evidence against you so we wont argue it
Now then we want to be going
Come along
Half a shake sir said Berry feeling in his pockets
You know that knife  The company began nervously to disperse
Some exhorted one another to observe some feature of the cromlechs which was only visible from some point of vantage on the side other to that on which we stood
Others agreed that they had no idea that it was so late and the fat tradesman gave a forced shiver and announced that he must have left his coat behind that big one
Ill get it for you sir said Berry opening his knife
I was forced to admit that Stonehenge looked far more impressive when apparently deserted than with one or two tourists however genial and guileless in a high holiday humour in the foreground
At the same time as we walked back to the car I felt that I owed it to myself to lodge a grave protest against the indecent and involving methods my brotherinlaw had seen fit to employ
After all I concluded the fellows your brother and even if his panama wasnt a real one thats no reason why he should be made to do the hundred in about twelve seconds
He wasnt in strict training either
You could see that
Besides why rope me in
For yourself if you must play the comic idiot  He wasnt in the picture said Berry
None of them were
That kids blazer absolutely killed the grass for miles around
Didnt you see how brown it had gone
That he added coolly is the worst of having an artistic eye
One must pay for these things
After spending the night at Salisbury we pushed on to the Cornish coast
It was not until we were within three miles of our village that we lost the way
When we found it again we were seven miles off
That is the worst of a car
However
Stern is a place where the coastline is a great glory
The cliffs rise there tall dark majesticgrave too especially grave
When the sky is grey they frown always and even the warm rays of the setting sun but serve to light their grand solemnity
Very different is the changing sea at their foot
At times it will ripple all day agog with smiling anon provoked by an idle breezes banter you shall see it black with rage
In the morning maybe it will sleep placidly enough in the sunshine but at eventide the wind has ruffled its temper so that it mutters and heaves with anger breathing forth threatenings
Yet the next dawn finds it alive with mischievous merriment and splitting its sides with laughter to think how it has duped you the night before
The great grave cliffs and the shifting sea and beyond woodland and pastures and deep meadows where the cows low in the evenings while the elms tower above them their leaves unshaken by the wind it is not difficult to grow fond of Stern
And now we were sitting on the cliffs in the heat of the morning sun half a mile from the village and another from the places where it was best to bathe
After a while Arent you glad I made you come here
said Daphne triumphantly
I sat up and stared at her sorrowfully
Well
she said defiantly
You have taken my breath away I said Kindly return it and I will deal with you and your interrogatories
I suppose youre going to say it was you  It was
I did
I have
But for me you would not
You are
I took the rooms
I drove the car nearly the whole way down
I got you all here
I sent the luggage on in advance
With the result that it got here two days after we did and I had to wear the same tie three days running and go down to bathe in patentleather boots thanks very much said Berry
Beyond saying that I was not responsible for the crass and purblind idiocy of railway officials I ignored this expression of ingratitude and continued to deal with Daphne
You know I said there are times when I tremble for you
Only yesterday just before dinner I trembled for you like anything
Its the heat said my target as if explaining something
And my reward is covert reflections upon my sanity
Need I say more
No said everybody
Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your kind attention
The next performance will be at four oclock this afternoon underneath the promenade pier
I relapsed into comfortable silence and sank back into the bracken
My sister got up from the clump of heather in which she was ensconced crossed to where I was took my pipe out of my mouth and kissed me
Sorry old boy she said youre not such a bad sort really
Dear love said I what have you left behind
My bathingdress darling
In spite of the fact that I returned to the hotel and got it they were positively rude about the bathingcove I selected
Bathe there
sneered Berry as we looked down upon it all smiling in the sun from the top of the cliffs
Thanks awfully I simply love the flints dont you Jill
Personally my doctor bled me just before I came away
But dont let me stop you others
Lead on brother lead the way to the shambles
Of course Daphne took up the running
My dear boy look at the seaweed on the rocks
Why we should slip and break our legs before wed taken two steps
Thats all right said Berry
We have between us three shirts
Torn into strips they will make excellent bandages while for a splint  The cove I said is ideal
Its sand is a field of lilies its sea perfumed its boulders sweetsmelling cushions
Of coursesaid Berry
Why do you tarry
Forward friends all
This way to the drug department
To the lions O Christians
For myself if I start at once I shall be able to get back with the coastguards ambulance before youve been lying there more than an hour or two and I can wire for your relatives at the same time
Anybody would think the place was an oubliette said I
As a matter of fact the path down is an easy one there are no flints and there is a singular paucity of seaweed of any description
On the other hand the sun is hot the sand is soft and I have already selected that rock in the seclusion of whose shade I shall prepare myself for the waves
Sorry its too dangerous for you
Ill write about some bathingmachines tonight
Do you like them with red or green doors
Without waiting for their reply which would probably have been of the caustic and provocative type I turned down the path I had not trodden for some three years
At one of the bends I looked up and saw them moving north along the coastline
I had the cove to myself and was soon in my bathingdress
The water was magnificent
I swam out about forty yards and turned just in time to see Berry  Co disappear in the distance apparently descending into a neighbouring cove
After a rest on a rock I set out to swim round and join them
It was further than I thought and I was glad to wade out of the water and lie down on the sand in the sun
No sign of the others by the way
But hereabouts the coast was very ragged
It must have been the next cove they were making for
Quite still please said somebody and the next moment a camera clicked
You might have given me time to moisten the lips said I
I doubt if it would have done any good
Thanks very much
By the way I suppose youre The Daily Glass
How did you find me out
Rumour travels apace sir
And I had been congratulating myself on eluding the Press since breakfast
Well well
Only this morning  Dry up
I apostrophized the sea
I dont want to have to report the chap I said but if   The camera clicked again
Im not sure this isnt an assault I said
That it is a trespass I know
Who are your solicitors
And may I take it that they will accept service
Here I rolled over and leaned on my elbow
You do look fit
Just move your heel out of that pool theres an anemone going to mistake it for a piece of alabaster
Thats right
Oh but Mermaid do tell me how you keep your hair so nice when youre bathing
Like it
I love it
I simply dont put my head under
A most dangerous practice believe me
Its worth the risk
I belive it is
She was sitting on a low slab of rock clad in a bathingcostume of plain dark blue and fashioned just like my own
Her dark hair was parted in the middle and divided at the back into two long thick plaits which were turned up and hairpinned round the top of her head
Her features were beautiful and her eyes big and dark as her hair
Her figure was slim and graceful and her arms and hands and feet were very shapely
One brown knee was crossed over the other and her left hand held the camera
I do have luck you knowI said
What luck
Well honestly its a great pleasure to meet you like this when I might have spent all day talking with my silly crowd and never have known of your existence
Dont be afraid
I merely mean that I am enjoying your society and Im glad I came round the corner
Im not in love with you and I dont want never to leave your side again but oh you understand Mermaid dont you
You look as if you could if you liked
My companion stared out to sea with a faint smile on her lips
I flung out an arm with a gesture of despair
Oh if you knew how sick I am of the girl about town the girl of today who wont be natural herself and wont let you be natural either who is always bored and who has no use for anyone who isnt forever making mock love to her or Why on earth cant a man tell a woman he likes her company and mean it without the woman thinking he wants to kiss her or marry her or something
I broke off and looked at her
Go on she said
You interest me
Oh Heavens I said falteringly
Why have you got such big eyes
At this to my discomfiture she broke into peals of merriment
Before you looked at me like that I was really enjoying your company without wanting to kiss you
Steady
Besides your eyes theres your Look here it isnt fair
Thatll do
Ill race you to that rock out there
She was in the water first but I beat her easily
We swam back together and she took her seat on the slab while I stretched myself on the sand by her side
Youre a very singular man she said after a while
I have been told so of many
And rather dull
I sat up
Dont say you want me to make love to you
Not much
This emphatically
Ah glad of a change I suppose
There was a silence while she eyed me suspiciously
At length I shall ask you to leave my cove if youre not careful she said
Mermaid I said I apologize
I was unaware that I had the honour to speak to the lady of the manor
Well if you didnt really know who I was But you mustnt be dull
I drew her attention to a sailing ship in the distance
Now that I said is what I call a really good ship
Barque
Barque I mean
It must be  About five thousand tons Burthen
Exactly
By the way I never know what that really means unless it means that if you wanted to lift it you couldnt
Try displacement
Thank you
It was off just such an one that I was cast away two years ago come Michaelmas
We were just standing by in the offing when she sterruck with a grinding crash
There was a matter of seventy souls aboard and I shall never forget the look on the captains face as the ships cat stole his place in the sternsheets of the jollyboat
I was thrown up on a desert island I was
You ought to have seen me milking the goats on Spyglass Hill
Did you wear a goatskin cap
Did I Not
And two muskets
But my snake belt was the great thing
You see  Which reminds me I think its about time I got civilized again
Not yet Mermaid I pleaded the sun is yet high
You dont suppose Im going to stay here all day do you
Were not on your precious island now
I only wish we were
I had my loaf of bread and jug of wine all right but the one thing I wanted Mermaid was  A woman to keep him company without thinking he wanted to kiss her or marry her or something
Whatevers that
I jumped to my feet and looked towards where she was pointing
It looks rather like forgive me a chemise
Good Heavens
Before I had time to move she rushed into the surf and secured the floating garment made another dart at something else and was knocked down by a roller
I had her on her feet in a moment but she dashed the water out of her eves and looked wildly to and fro over the sea
What is it Mermaid
She tried to stamp her foot but the four inches of water in which she was standing were against her
Cant you see idiot
This is mine this chemise sos this shoe
The tides come up into my cave while Ive been making a fool of myself talking to you and all my things are gone
Theres the other shoe
All right Ill get it
I got it and one stocking but though I swam about till I was tired and even climbed on to the rock now almost submerged to which we had raced I could see nothing else
I returned temporarily exhausted to the cove
She waded out to meet me
Tell me exactly where your cave is I said as I handed her the flotsam
She showed me and after a moment or twos rest I swam out and round to the mouth only to find the water too high to enter
I did try but a wave lifted me up to the roof and I only saved a broken head at the expense of a nasty cut on the back of my hand
She was anxiously awaiting me and listened to my report without a word
When I had finished she deliberately wrung the last atom of water out of the derelict stocking smoothed it out carefully by the side of the chemise in the sun laid herself down on the sand and burst into tears
I tried to comfort her
I patted her shoulder and took her hand in mine
Dont worry Mermaid dear I said
Trust me Ill think of something
I know
Ill swim round to my cove and dress and then go and get you some fresh clothes before anyones the wiser
See
Ill go nowI added getting up and licking the blood off my hand
You wait here and  I broke off abruptly and one of the more violent expletives indicative of combined horror and amazement escaped my lips before I could stop it
What is it
wailed the Mermaid
On the crest of a wave some thirty yards from the shore danced my grey hat
Beyond it a little to the right was something which might be a shirt
Stammering incoherent sentences I staggered into the water and swam for the hat
When I had caught it I went on to get the shirt
I would have gone on round the headland to my cove only the shirt was not my shirt
It was Berrys
Yes it was had his name on it and all
And not ten yards away floated Daphnes straw hat
For the next two minutes I was in imminent danger of drowning
At last I began to swim feebly blindly back
When I reached the shore I fell on my knees in the surf and laughed till the eighth wave knocked me head over heels and the ninth broke into my open jaws and choked me
The next moment the girl caught me by the arm and I stumbled out and lay down on the dry sand with the shirt clasped to my breast
My hat had gone again ages ago
Then I looked at the girl kneeling anxiously by my side and began to laugh again
She sat back on her heels with one hand to her lips and a scared expression on her face
Hes mad she said half to herself mad
Must have been stung by a jellyfish or something
Ive heard  I cut her short
Mermaid dear Im as sane as you are only  Only what
Everybodys doing it she recoiled doing it
Listen to me
True that is your chemise
True that out there is my hat there it is
But here is Berrys shirt and miles out there is Daphnes straw hat
If Id stayed long enough Ive no doubt I should have seen Jonahs trousers and Jills chemisette which means or mean whichever you like that  Hurriedly I explained and then fell again into uproarious laughter
This time she joined me in my mirth
At length  But after all she said it doesnt make it any better for me because Im all alone while youre a party
I admit it has been said that Unity is Strength said I but I dont know that that exactly applies  And I cant walk home like this even with that on
She indicated the chemise
Certainly not with that on itd only make it more indec  More what
Er unusual
Indeed it would
She regarded me suspiciously
Then What about you
Me
How dyou mean
I said uneasily
Well couldnt you slip back to the hotel somehow
Quite quietly I mean and  I could slip all right said I
The short grass on the top of the cliffs would help me there
But my dear girl how on earth can I do anything quietly in this dress
Everybody will be  Just finishing lunch or sitting on the terrace
Thanks very much
Theres a back door
I never thought of that
Splendid
Leading to the kitchen of course
Theyd never notice me there
And I could just drop in at the office for the key of my room and see if there were any letters on the way up and My dear girl how can I
I admit Ive a good deal of nerve but there is a limit
I know one can do most things nowadays but  But this is a special occasion
You seem to want to make it one
And it cant be helped
This sort of modestys out of date
Not my date
Besides everybodyd understand
I know they would
Thats just what Im afraid of
Well we must do something and if you  Suddenly there fell upon our ears the scrambling clattering noise which invariably accompanies the descent of anybody rash enough to enter a Cornish cove with undue haste in leathersoled shoes
The Mermaid darted behind a rock and I advanced gratefully up the foreshore to the fringe of stones
The noise grew louder and the slips more frequent until there was one long one and then a thud
Up rose a fat oath
After a moment or two there limped into sight oh blessed spectacle one of the hotel porters conventionally hatless and coatless
Ah
said I
The coastguard you sent hailed me sir across the fields yonder
Said something had happened he didnt know what but he heard the word hotel
You see you shouting to him from here and he being up on top he couldnt hear anything else rightly so I came straight down
Why didnt be come down himself when er when I shouted
He was taking a telegram to the post office sir
Said he told you so but I suppose you didnt hear
Berrys coastguard
Berrys porter
I told him that my clothes had been washed away and that the mermaid was in the same plight
I gave him implicit instructions and with her assistance the numbers of our respective rooms
He wrote it all down
He was to get some clothes for me himself and enlist the services of a chambermaid for my companion
Be as quick as you can I said as he turned to go
Youre sure youll know this cove again
Theyre all rather alike
Thats all right sir
The next moment he was halfway up the path
If he had looked back he would have beheld the singular and doubtless pleasing spectacle of the Mermaid and myself doing the real Argentine tango along the stretch of yellow sand
She did not see the blood on my hand for a minute or two
Then My dear lad what have you done to your hand
Cut on the rocks I said laconically
Nothing of any consequence I assure you
I shall be able to proceed home
After attention
Let me look at it
And so it came about that when the boots returned my left hand was bound up with a strip of chemise and the bandage was tied with the palepink ribbon that had lately lain upon the Mermaids shoulder
We received him delightedly
The Mermaids garments had been placed by the thoughtful chambermaid in a little dressingcase
Mine were tied together with a piece of string after the manner of costumes at Nathans
But they were all right
The girl started to dress behind a rock and I told the fellow to wait at the foot of the path
I have reasonI said reason to believe that there are others even now in the same or selfsame plight as that in which you found us
Therefore remain within call
Dont investigate for yourself
This is my show
But dont go
He promised
Half an hour later he was once more on his way to the hotel with a note from me for Daphnes maid and the promise of half a sovereign while the Mermaid and I stood at the top of the path which led down to the cove where the rest of my party were chafing in exasperated idleness with the exception of Berry that is
Prior to our arrival he had been hovering about on the top of the cliff but the instant he descried us and while we were yet a great way off he had retired precipitately and was now busy rejoining the others with Agags walk and a profusion of embryo profanity
He explained afterwards that if he had been wearing his own bathingdress instead of a green and red striped one his own was being mended he should have remained but that he did not like to be seen wearing the colours of the Redruth Rangers before he had been elected
After waiting a minute or two to compose ourselves and settle finally our plan of action we followed gaily in Berrys wake
I was just saying in a clear voice that perhaps it was rather soon after lunch to bathe again when we came upon them the other side of a large rock
One and all they sprawled easily on the sand in the hot sunshine as if care were a thing of the past forgotten never known
This was no more than I had expected of them
Al of us hate to be caught bending
Berry especially
That artist was busily fashioning a miniature rampart of sand
He looked up at my greeting and rose to his feet
I introduced them all to the Mermaid
We made friends at lunch I explained over the lobsters
Jonah winced
And then as we wanted a walk we thought wed come along to fetch you back to tea
There was a polite murmur of appreciation
I must say I went on it is glorious
I almost wish Id given up my lunch too
The Mermaid stiffened but none of the others noticed the error
I felt myself colouring like a fool
Arent you going to bathe again
said Berry
There was the note of eagerness in his voice and I saw a vision of Berry in my clothes striding triumphantly homewards
I dont think so I said carelessly
Rather too soon after lunch
But Im going to take off my coat and sit down in the sun
After all he couldnt do much with a coat
The Mermaid was already seated between Daphne and Jill talking vivaciously
Jonah pretended to be asleep
After a furtive glance at the top of the cliff Berry resumed his building operations with awful deliberation
After a while Well if you arent going to bathe any more arent you going to dress
said I
And leave this beauty spot
said Berry
Shame shame on you brother
Go your ways if you will
Then wander forth the sons of Belial
Youll just be in time
But leave us here in peace
I have almost evolved a postfuturist picture which will revolutionize the artistic world
I shall call it The Passing of a Bathe a Fantasy
It will present to the minds of all who have not seen it what they would have rejected for lunch if they had
To get the true effect no one must see it
But if some one does
I shall have already left the country
This was too much for Daphne and she asked Jonah to come and help her to get some mussels
They walked away together
What on earth does she want mussels for
said I
The garden paths said Berry
Our cobbles arent wearing at all well
I turned to the Mermaid
She was chattering away to Jill with her back towards me
Over her shoulder Jills grey eyes regarded me wistfully
I made a rapid calculation
Yes the porter ought to have arrived by now
I had told him to keep out of sight till I called him
I waited until Daphne and Jonah came strolling back emptyhanded
They had forgotten about the mussels
Daphnes brows were knitted and Jonah was looking ruefully at the sun
It was getting on for halfpast three
One could guess that much
I rose and picked up my coat
I say arent you ever going to dress any more
I said
Daphne swallowed before replying and with the tail of my eye I saw Berry start and wreck six inches of architecture
Then  Presently said my big sister
You two go on and order a big tea at the farm and by the time its ready  You cant have tea like that I said
Therell be a row
In the dead silence that followed this remark the Mermaid rose and brushed the sand from her dress
I went up to Daphne and kissed her
Dont think Im not proud of you darling and Jill looks lovely too but they wouldnt stand it you know
No one stirred except the Mermaid and she obedient to the instructions I had given her strolled naturally enough towards the path up the cliff
The other four were looking at me straitly I could feel their gaze wondering whether whether I knew
I shaded my eyes with my hand and stared seawards
Do dress I said absently
We shall dress when we want to said Daphne sharply
I turned to see the Mermaiden reach the path
A good start is everything
If you really mean that I said slowly Ill send your other clothes back again
Then I raised my voice Porter
I cried
Sir
came from above us
Behold now  I let the rest of the quotation go as I wanted to rejoin the mermaid looking as she had last seen me
Berry said afterwards that Jonah gained on me while the sand lasted but the loose stones at the foot of the path were my salvation
As I passed the porter I told him to say that a square meal would be awaiting them at the farm
We ordered it generously enough but despite our hunger the Mermaid and I decided to have our own tea at the hotel
Thither we set out to walk through the fields
Suddenly she stopped as we were crossing a deep lane
I dont know why youre here she said
Try and think Mermaid
Youd better go and have another bathe
Now Mermaid you know  Afterwards youll be wishing you had given up your tea if you dont
I knew we should have this I said
Well it wasnt very polite of you was it
It wouldnt have been
She eyed me scornfully for a moment
Then Im disappointed in you she said
Youll be more so in a moment said I
Why
Youre not going to have a change after all
Dont say youre going to make  Love to you
Yes I am
She looked me up and down for a moment
And this is the man she said slowly this is the man Who said he was not in love with you and that he didnt want never to leave your side again
Yes it is
I might have known better than to say a thing like that
All the same it wasnt meant for a challenge Mermaiden
She looked at me with a mischievous smile
And now  I broke off and took her small brown hand
Up went the dark eyebrows
I shouldnt like you to think that I thought you wanted to kiss me she said
I think nothing said I
But one thing I know
And that is
That it would be a crime if I didnt
The very stones would cry out
I dont think they would
Im afraid they might said I
CHAPTER III WHEN IT WAS DARK Daphne pointed suddenly to the stile
This is it she said
We get over here and go across the meadow and theres the wood beyond the gate that weve got to to whats the word
Encompass
I hazarded
Skirt
said Jonah
Skirt thank you till we come upon the carttrack
And then
said I
Then were all right she said defiantly
Which means that about two hours from now we shall with a fine disregard for the highest traditions of British pugilism strike the high road below the belt of firs a good six miles from the rooftree we should never have left
God forgive you
Am I said Berry am I to understand in cold blood that reckoning three miles to the league some four leagues lie directly between me and the muffins
You are said I
To think that my wife is a bag he said wearily
It was an autumn afternoon in the county of Devon
There were we staying at a retired farmhouse fleeting the time carelessly simply healthily
Sickened by fortyeight hours of continuous rain we had fastened greedily upon the chance which a glorious October day at length offered and had set out complete with sandwiches for one of the longer walks
Daphne constituted herself guide
We never asked her to
But as such we just accepted her
We were quite passive in the matter
Going she had guided us with a careless confidence which shamed suspicion
But coming back she had early displayed unmistakable signs of hesitation and anxiety
Thereafter she had plunged desperately with the result that at three oclock we found ourselves reduced to a swineherd who had been drinking
The latter detailed to us four several routes and assured us that it was utterly impossible to miss any one of them
To put it quite shortly he was mistaken
Within half an hour we had missed them all
Lost on a heath which I have every reason to suppose was blasted in a strange county and not a soul in sight
That was the position
We plodded in silence across the meadow
Didnt say anything about a bog did he
said Berry drawing his left leg out of some mire with a noise that made me shudder
Jill slid a warm arm into mine and broke into long laughter
Dont encourage the fool said Daphne
We skirted the wood successfully to find that there never could have been a carttrack
Berry leaned against a wall of stones
What a picture he said ecstatically
The setting sun the little band the matron and the maid mist rising shadows falling subject for next years Academy The Walkers
Idiot
said Daphne shortly
Do I hear aright
said Berry
I said idiot
Berry covered his face with his hat and begged us to excuse his emotion
Daphne stamped her foot
I have an idea said I
If its one of your usual ones we dont want it said Daphne
Thank you dear
We are undoubtedly lost
No that is not my idea
But as a wouldhavebeen boyscout I recognize in this spot a natural campingplace
That water is close at hand we know from Scout Berry
Jonah can take the first watch Berry the second Jonah the third and and so on
My own energy I shall reserve for the dogwatch
Oh stop him somebody wailed Daphne
I said dogwatch dear not stopwatch
Before we bivouac I will scale yon beetling mount if peradventure I may perceive one that will point us homeward
Scout Berry
Sir said Berry
You know your duties
I do that sir
Tis well
If the worst comes to the worst kill the women out of hand or with your own hand I dont care which
Age before honesty you know
With that I left them and turned to climb the hill which rose sharply on our right its side dotted with furzebushes and its crest hidden by a clump of trees
Five minutes later I was back among them again
Well said Daphne eagerly you havent been right to the top have you
Oh no
I only came back to say that when I said Age before honesty just now I really meant Death before dishonour you know and I turned up the bank again
I regret to say that Berry and Jonah thought it decent to attempt to stone my retreating figure
Ten minutes walking brought me to a clearing on the top which afforded a magnificent view
Hill and dale woodland and pasture stone wall and hedgerow as far as I could see
The sinking sun was lighting gloriously the autumn livery of the woods and far in the distance I could see the silver streak of the river flowing to the village on whose skirts stood the house that was our bourne
When I returned to the camp to find them gone I was rather bored
The note that they had left made it worse Regret compelled retire owing to serious outflanking movement on part of the Blues
Sorry but thats the worst of being picket
The natural intuition which characterizes all BSS will enable you to discern our route
So long
Although I tried four times mainly because Jonah had my matches I was unable to discern their route
At last I came down to shouting but only succeeded in arousing the curiosity of three cows and a wellnourished ram
The latter was so well nourished that when he had stamped for the second time I thought it prudent to get over the wall
I did so with about four seconds to spare
Nothing daunted the winning animal took a short run and butted the wall with surprising vigour
When three large stones had fallen for seven runs I offered up a short prayer that Berry  Co might return to look for me and hastened to put two more walls between us
I suppose it was the river that I saw in the distance from the summit of that fair hill Three and a half hours later I came upon the first signs of animal life as opposed to vegetable since the ram
Up hill down dale along roads along imitation roads along future roads along past roads across moors I had tramped doggedly blindly and rather angrily
If I had had one match only one match it would have been different
Yes it was a dogcart
And through the gloom I could distinctly see the shape of some one sitting in it holding the reins
I quickened my steps
I say have you got a match
A girls voice
Thats about the worst thing you could have said
said I
Why
Because a match is the one thing Ive been wanting for the last four hours
Sorry
Swear for me will you
Certainly madam
What sort of an oath would you like
We have a very large assortment in stock fresh lot in only this afternoon
Let me see
Now Ive got a very nice thing in oaths  I want a round one
Round
Certainly
And the usual black I presume
We have been doing rather a lot in the way of blue oaths lately
No
Damn
How do you like that madam
Thatll do
Much obliged to you madam
Sign please
Nothing else I can show you
Nothing in the curse line
No thanks
Good day
There was a pause
Presently I said good day said the girl
Yes said I but then we were only playing
Oh were you
Any way you havent paid yet I said desperately
How much do you want
It was a very common oath
Ive plenty more if you like
For instance  Hush
Not before the mare
Whats your price
The privilege of accompanying you on foot till we can get a light
You cant drive at more than a walking pace on this road without lamps
And its not right for you to be alone
You are very good
But are you going my way
Ive not the faintest idea
Are you lost then
Hopelessly
Have been for hours
Where do you want to get to
A farmhouse three miles out of Lorn
Which side of Lorn
Well if Im the same side of Lorn as I was at one oclock this afternoon its the other side
Well but arent you
My dear girl I dont know
She laughed
Well Im going to Lorn any way she said so come along
Heaven will reward you said I and climbed into the cart
Youd better drive
I took the reins
We had to go very slowly for it was one of the imitation roads and when we were not scaling an ascent that positively beetled we were going down a descent which I was glad it was too dark to see
After a minute or two I took the near wheel eighteen inches up the bank
Sorry said the girl as she disengaged herself from my neck and arms and resumed her seat but it was your fault for taking it up the bank
I know
I hope you werent frightened
Im awfully sorry
You drive rather well considering
Steady the Buffs
Considering what
Considering its your first shot
In silence I gave her the reins
After that I said icily after that there is no more to be said
Was it for this that at the age of four I was borne by two reluctant goats along the Hastings strand
Pardon me those last six words comprise an iambic line a fact which is itself the best evidence of my agitation
It is a little winning way I have
Most criminals when charged make no reply
When I am arrested I shall protest in anapaests
As I was saying was it for this 
Stop stop she said laughing you drive all right beautifully
I took the reins again
It was getting very cold and I put the rug carefully about her
Youre very good she saidbut wait
I felt her hand on my knee
Oh you havent got any of it
She would have untucked it again if I hadnt caught her wrist
Thats all right I said
Im not allowed rugs
Nonsense
My dear doctors orders
The last thing the great Harley Street specialist said to me as I pushed the two pounds two shillings beneath the current number of The Lancet was Now mind no rugs
Eat and drink what you like
Smoke in moderation and get up as late as you please
But no rugs
As the wrist felt unconvinced I slipped it through my arm where it lay comfortably enough
Do vou often do this sort of thing
I said presently
Get late coming home and have no lights
Not often
Im glad of that Im sure its very dangerous
Good whips like myself arent as common as blackberries
And so few tramps one meets nowadays can drive really well
I dont look as if Id got any money do I
Well you dont look anything just now as its too dark to see but you sound like a wristwatch and a chain purse
How did you know
Intuition I said carelessly
You see Im a boyscout
Feel
She laid a slim warm wrist against my cheek
I distinctly felt the cold round glass of a wristwatch
And Ive got a chainpurse in my bag
Ah
Go on boyscout
Tell me what I look like in the daytime
You have earrings and your face is rather cold
About the kind of earrings I am not certain
How did you know that
I found that out when er when we went up the bank
Oh
Yes I went on hurriedly and  Am I dark or fair
Ilooked hopelessly at where I knew my companion was sitting
Then Dark I said after a minute
Dark with long eyelashes and two brown eyes
Two
Yes I think so
You sound extravagant
Dimples
I think not
Nose
Yes
Yes what
Yes please teacher
Nonsense
What did you mean by yes
Sorry
I thought you were asking me if youd got a nose and I think you have
Thats all
Sorry if Im wrong but when youre in the dark  Yes but what sort of nose
Here I got the near wheel up the bank again with great effect
When we had sorted ourselves If you do that again she said severely III leave you in the road  In the what
In the road to find your own way home as best you can
You have a hard nose I said doggedly
I was almost sure that the earrings were pearl earrings
There was a pause
The cold was making us silent
My fingers were getting numbed but I dared not chafe them
I was afraid of the rug
Youre not doing much for your drive she said presently
Do say something
You want to converse
Yes
Very well then
I didnt see you at Blackpool this year
Thats curious
Yes isnt it
Whats your recreation
Forgive my seeming inquisitiveness but Ive just joined the staff of Whos Who
What
No who
Recreation
Yes
Hobby amusement
Dont you collect cats or keep stamps or motorboat or mountebank I mean mountaineer or anything
No
Never mind
I expect you know Oldham rather well dont you
Not at all
Oh Im sorry
Why
Because I dont know it either and I thought  What
Well you know we ought to know Oldham one of us ought to
It was a Unionist gain last time
Are you a Unionist
My dear you see in me at least you would see in me if it were not so dark a high Tory
I thought you were a boyscout
The two are not incompatible
Did you see that thing in Ally Sloper last week
No I didnt
Heres a gate
I got down and opened it and she drove carefully through
It was the first of seven gates
By the time we had done six I was becoming good at getting up and down but rather tired
As I resumed my seat for the sixth time I sighed
For the sixth time she returned me the reins
You dont take much care of your clothes boyscout she said
Nearly all the men I know hitch up their trousers when they sit down
Perhaps theyre sailors
No they arent
My dear girl I dont know how you can see I dont but I dont because I havent got any on
I mean Im wearing breeches
Would you hitch them up if you had got on trousers
Lets see todays Thursday
Yes I should
Why do men always bother so about their knees
Take care of the bags and the coats will take care of themselves I observed sententiously
But why 
Here we came apon the seventh gate
I groaned
Six gates shalt thou labour and do all that thou hast to do but the seventh  Out you get boyscout
I laid a hand on my companions shoulder
Are you an enchantress
I said
At least of course you are
But I mean is this the way to your castle Circe
And am I going to be turned into a herd of swine presently
They always have seven gates and a dense forest through which I cut a path with my sword which by the way I have left in the toolshed unless perchance maiden thou hast filched it from my side this last halfhour
Note the blank verse again
I may say I am looking at you narrowly
Fret not for thy sword Sir Scout
she replied neither flatter thyself that Circe wastes her spells on all who come her way
Those only will she lure who  I simply love your voice I said
Get down and open the gate
I did so and climbed slowly back
Its all right she said We havent got much further to go
Im sorry for that
Sorry
Certainly
Ive enjoyed this awfully
Its rather funny isnt it
Our meeting in the dark like this and driving all these miles together and not being able to see each other once
Unique I should think
Yes its rather like being in a cell next to some one and talking by rapping against the wall
Is it
Yes it reminds me awfully of my young days at Brixton
Were you at school there
Yes for five years before I went to Dartmoor
Oh were you at Dartmoor
I had a cousin there a year or two ago
But hes out now
His name was Taber
What
Not Billy Taber
Thats right
This is very strange Circe
Yes boyscout
Round to the left here
Thats right
Only three more miles
This is Dilberry Farm
Dilberry
Why thats  Where youre staying
I gulped and laid the whip over the mares shoulders
No I said doggedly its not
She laid two firm little hands on my left and pulled the mare up
Anything the matter
said I
Say goodbye like a good boyscout and thank the kind lady for giving you a lift and then run along home she said sweetly
What are we stopping for
I said
You cant get a good view from here today
Its too hazy
Go on
But Circe  Be quick
Im awfully cold
Wont you come in and get warm before you go on or borrow another rug or  No thanks awfully I must get home
Maynt I see you there
I can easily walk back
No thanks awfully boyscout
You mean it
I do
I gave her the reins and got heavily out of the dogcart
She moved on to the seat I had vacated and I put the rug carefully round her feet
Suddenly I remembered
Stop I said
Let me get some matches
At least your lamps shall be lighted
Not a bit of it
Said she didnt want them lighted
Simply wouldnt have it
While I was speaking my fingers had mechanically strayed to the ticket pocket of my coat where I sometimes carry my matches loose
By George 
I said
What is it
Ive just found a bit of a matchwith the head on
Oh boyscout and youve had it all the time
Yes but it wouldnt be enough to light the lamps with
Oh
Not the lamps
What would it be enough for
A face Circe
Goodbye
Stop Circe
Two faces
How
Well I11 strike it on the tire and then hold it between us
All right
Itll only last a second its not a quarter of an inch long
Youll have to bend down
Go on
Nerve yourself for the shock Circe
Think you can stand it
Ill try
Keep your back to the mare
Thank you
I heard her lean over and struck the match on the tire I raised it cautiously sheltering it with my hands
Just as I was about to raise my eyes Thank you she said very softly and blew it out
I laid my hands on her shoulders
I wont say damn I said
IIl say goodbye instead like like a good boyscout
Say it then
I said it
Oh but that isnt  Yes I said
Its a new rule
When the clatter of the mares hoofs had died away in the distance I walked slowly up to the farm
I was quite sure about the earrings this time
At least about the one in her left ear
Ah said Daphne as I entered the roomwhere have you been all this time
All things considered I thought that was rather good
I dont think Ive been into Cornwall I saidbut Ive done Devon pretty thoroughly
We went back for you
Ah
Why do you say Ah

Oh I dont know
Didnt see anything of a ram did you
I added carelessly
There was a pause
Not until after hed seen Berry said Jonah
Ah where is Berry
Upstairs said Daphne
He did er see Berry then
Yes
Er how did he see him
I mean hang it I didnt bring the beastly ram there
You left him there said Daphne
I know but you cant pick up every tame ram you meet
Besides  Tame
said Jonah
Good Lord
He saw Berry you say
Did he see him well
I think hed have seen him home if it hadnt been for the brook
Courteous beast
He saw him as far as that did he
He saw him halfway across
I regret to say I laughed so immoderately that I never noticed that Berry had entered the room until he clapped me on the shoulder
It was a neat revenge said that gentleman very neat my boy
But you deserve six months for it
Hang it I said you seem to think I  I should certainly have haunted you said Berry
Six weeks had sloped by
The train ran slowly into the station
I got out
Then I remembered my umbrella and got back
Then I got out again
PorterI said
The individual addressed turned round and I saw it was the stationmaster
For a few moments he regarded me with indignation obviously wondering whether he would be exceeding his duty if he ordered me to be flung to the engine
Two inspectors hovered longingly near him
Then he said Chut
and turned away
I fought my way the length of the platform to the vicinity of the luggage van
Four porters were standing looking moodily at the luggage already upon the platform
I touched one on the shoulder
Yes I said its a nice bit of luggage isnt it
He said it was
Dont you think its that dressingcase that does it
Lends an air of distinction to the rest
Bucks it all up as it were eh
Before he could reply So youre down for the weekend too said a voice I should have recognized amid the hubbub of the heavenly choir 
Staying at Watereaton
It was she
Such a pretty girl
Very fair very blue eyes a beautiful skin and yes a dimple
She was wearing a long fur coat while a little black felt hat with a ghost of a brim leaned exquisitely over one of the blue eyes
Her hands were plunged into deep pockets but a pair of most admirable legs more than made good the deficit
I sighed
Disappointed
she said
Not in you youre beautiful
But in myself
Yes I shall resign
Resign
My scouthood
You were wrong about my hair but  But what
You knew me again at any rate
But of course
Youve the same voice and the same dear laugh and yes youve got  What
The same earrings said I
Chapter IV ADAM AND NEW YEARS EVE Jonah rose walked to the window pulled the curtains aside and peered out into the darkness
What of the night
said I
Doth the blizzard yet blizz
said Berry
It doth said Jonah
Good said Berry
Then he turned to Daphne
Darling you have my warmest Yuletide greetings and heartiest good wishes for a bright New Year
Remember the old saying You may have move pretentious wishes But more sincere you cant than this is
Do you believe its going on like this
said his wife
Dear heart two words my love for you is imperishable
If it were left at the goods station for a month during a tram strike it would unlike the sausages emerge fresh and sweet as of yore
I mean it
Fool said Daphne
I meant the weather as you know
A rebuff said her husband
Do I care
Never
Strike me in the wind and I will offer you my second wind for another blow
I did not forget everything when I married you
But to the weather
This berlizzard German has its disadvantages
A little more and we shant be able to bathe tomorrow
Never mind
Think of the Yule log
Noel
Here he regarded his empty glass for a moment
Woman lo your lords beaker requires replenishing
I ought not to have to tell you really
However
Daphne selected one of the harder chocolates took careful aim and discharged it in the direction of her husbands face
It struck him on the nose
Good shot said I
That entitles you to a vase
If you like you can have another two shots instead
Ill take the vase said my sister
For all the area of the target I mightnt hit it again
A few years ago said Berry you would probably have been pressed to death for this impious display
In consideration of your age you might instead have been sent to a turret
Whats a turret
said Jill
Old English for bathroom dear and kept there till you had worked the murder of Becket in tapestry and four acts
I shall be more merciful
When you can show me a representation of the man who drew Slipaway in the Calcutta Sweep trying to believe that it wouldnt have won even if it hadnt been knocked down when it was leading by nineteen lengths  Very brilliant said Daphne but the point is what are we going to do about tomorrow night
If it goes on like this we cant go
Oh but we must said Jill
My dear Im not going out in this sort of weather without Sjvensen and he may be too busy to leave town
Besides the blubber hasnt come yet
Couldnt we get hold of Wenceslas
said I
Hes getting five million a week at the Palliseum
Makes footprints there twice daily in real snow
The audience are invited to come and tread in them
They do too like anything
Happily Wenceslas is famed for the size of his feet
But you cant expect a man to leave  But it cant go on like this said Daphne My dear English weather is like your dear self capable of anything
Be thankful that we have only snow
If it occurred to it to rain icebergs so that we were compelled willy or even nilly to give up sleeping out of doors it would do so
Well Im tired
What about turning out eh
Light the lanthorn Jonah and give me my dressinggown
If you want to make me really ill said Daphne youll go on talking about bathing and sleeping out of doors
Berry laughed a fat laugh
My dear he explained I was only joking
We were all housed together in an old old country inn the inn of Fallow which village lies sleeping at the foot of the Cotswold Hills
We knew the place well
Few stones of it had been set one upon the other less than three hundred years ago and summer and winter alike it was a spot of great beauty comparatively little known too and far enough from London to escape most tourists
The inn itself had sheltered Cromwell and before his time better men than he had warmed themselves at the great hearth round which we sat
For all that he had given his name to the panelled room
Our bedrooms were as old lowpitched and full of beams
The stairs also were a great glory
In fact the house was in its way unique
A discreet decorator too had made it comfortable
Save in the Cromwell room electric light was everywhere
And in the morning chambermaids led you by crooked passages over uneven doors to white bathrooms
It was all right
Hither we had come to spend Christmas and the New Year
By day we walked for miles over the Cotswolds or took the car and looked up friends who were keeping Christmas in the country not too manv miles away
The Dales of Stoy had been kind and before the frost came I had had two days hunting with the Heythrop
And tomorrow was New Years Eve
Four miles the other side of the old market town of Steeple Abbas and twentyone miles from Pallow stood Bill Manor where the Hathaways lived
This good man and his wife Milly were among our greatest friends and they had wanted us to spend Christmas with them
Though we had not done so we had motored over several times and they had lunched with us at Fallow only the day before
And for New Years Eve the Hathaways had arranged a small but very special ball to which of course we were bidden
Indeed I think the ball was more for us than for anyone else
Anyway Jim and Milly said so
The idea was that we should come over in the car in time for dinner with the houseparty the ball would begin about ten and when it was over we should return to Fallow in the ordinary way
Nobody had anticipated such heavy weather
And now it was a question whether we should be able to go
Also if we went whether we should be able to get back
The dispute waxed
Daphne and Jill insisted that go we must could and should
I rather supported them
Berry and Jonah opposed us the latter quietly as is his wont the former with a simple stream of provoking irony
At length Very well ghouls said Berry have your most wicked way
Doubtless the good monks of the Hospice will find my corpse
I wish the drinkingtrough which will be erected to my memory to stand halfway up StJamess Street
How strange it will sound in future
Whatll sound
said Jill
The new Saints Day dear Berrymas
When order had been restored Jonah suggested that we should adjourn the debate till the next morning in case it stopped snowing during the night
As it was nearly one the idea seemed a good one and we went to bed
The morning was bright and cloudless
The cold was intense but the sun glorious while the clear blue sky looked as if it had never heard of snow
In a word the weather was now magnificent and but for the real evidence Upon the countryside no one would ever have believed such a cheery goodnatured fellow guilty of a raging blizzard
But the snow lay thick upon the ground and it was freezing hard
We can get there all right said Jonah but I dont see the car coming back at four oclock in the morning
No thanks IIl have marmalade
Theres almost a full moon said I
I know said Berry but the banjos being painted
Wed better stop at the inn at Steeple Abbas said Jonah
If we can get as far as Steeple we can make Fallow said I
Remember Im driving
We are not likely to forget it brother said Berry
If you knew the difference between the petroltank and the gearbox But I do
Petrol in one tools in the other
However
Jonahs right said Daphne
Wed better stop at Steeple
Not I
said I
Nor me said Jill
Boy and Ill come back to our dear Fallow and our nice big grate and our own beds
Good little girl said I Berry emptied his mouth and began to recite Excelsior
At twenty minutes past three the next morning I drove out of the courtyard of The Three Bulls Steeple Abbas
Alone too for it had begun to snow again and although I was determined to sleep that night or what remained of it at Fallow I would not take Jill with me for such an ugly run
As a matter of fact I had started once with her in the car but before we had got clear of the town I had turned about and driven her back to the inn
The people had evidently half expected her back for as we stopped at the door it was flung open and the landlord stood ready to welcome her in
The next moment I was once more on my way
In spite of the weather the car went well and I had soon covered more than half the distance
I was just about to emerge from a sideroad on to the main highway when a dark mass right on the opposite corner against the hedgerow attracted my attention
The next second my headlights showed what it was and I slowed down
A great limousine if you please standing at an angle of twenty degrees its near front wheel obviously well up the bank and the whole car sunk in a drift of snow some four or five feet deep
All its lights were out and fresh snow was beginning to gather on the top against the luggage rail
I stopped took out one of my side oil lamps and getting out of the car advanced to the edge of the drift holding the light above my head
The limousine was evidently a derelict
You look just like a picture Ive seen somewhere said a gentle voice
And youve got a voice just like a dream Ive dreamed some time or other
Isnt that strange
And now who what where why and how are you
Are you the goddess in the car or the woman in the case
And may I wish you a very happy New Year
I said it first
Try the woman in the car
One moment said I
I know
What
I know who you are
Just fancy
Who am I
Why youre New Years Eve
A little laugh answered me
I know Ive dreamed that laugh said I
However where were we
Oh I know
And your father Christmas has gone for help
If I know anything he wont be back again for ages
Seriously how did what happen
Chauffeur took the turn rather late and next moment we were up the bank and in this wretched drift
It wasnt altogether the mans fault
One of our headlights wouldnt work and you couldnt see the drift till we were in it
He might have known better than to run so close to the hedge these days
Hes paying for it any way poor man
Hes got to walk till he finds a farm where theyll lend him horses to get the car out
Considering the hour and the climatic conditions I dont suppose the farmers will come running
I mean theyll wait to put some clothes on
Probably
Besides he doesnt know the district so hes up against something this little night
Of all nights too Eve
But what about her poor lass
Oh Im all right
You must be
But dont you find it rather hot in there
Can I turn on the electric fan
Ive been making good resolutions to pass the time
Hurray
Sove I Im going to give up ferns
And you can tell me yours as we go along
Go along
Yes my dear
Didnt I tell you I was a highwayman
I only left York two hours ago
Quick going
Yes I came by the boat train with Black Bess in a horsebox
And now Im going to abduct you Eve
Your souls not your own when youre up against High Toby
I have a pistol in my holster a cloak on my back and a price on my head
My enemies call me Red Nat me friends  I paused
What do your friends call you
Adam said I
Lets see
Youll have to get out on the near side wont you
Wait a moment
I plunged round the back of the car and opened the door
Certainly it was terribly cold
While we had been talking she had been leaning against the side of the tilted car with her face close to the inch and a half of open window
Except for an occasional flash which had showed where her eyes were I had not seen her at all
Expectantly I raised the lamp and peered into the limousine
Out of a huge fur rug a solitary eye regarded me steadily
Only one eye
I said
How sad
How did it happen
The solitary eye went out and then reappeared with a fellow
You remind me of the North Foreland said I
Thats an intermittent light isnt it
Two winks and a blink every ten seconds
I didnt wink
This in a plainly indignant if muffled tone too muffled for me
So I beg your pardon said I
A little hand appeared and pulled the rug away from a small white nose and a mouth whose lips were paler than they should be
But it was a dear mouth
I said I didnt wink
So you did
I dont mean you did you know
I mean I know you said you didnt
Im not sure Ive got it right now
Never mind
Ive only one brain and at this hour of night  The vitality of the human frame is at its lowest ebb
Exactly
Thats why you must let me get you out of this as quick as possible
Oh but I dont think I mean  My dear Eve I know you come of an oldfashioned family look at your father but Conventions going by the board tonight
Im staying at an inn about nine miles away
Well be there under the halfhour
Theres supper and a fire waiting for us Why yes and you can have Jills room
Of course therell be a fire there too and everything ready
You see  Hurriedly I explained the situation
When I had finished But whatll the inn people think
she said with big eyes
Oh hang the inn people
And supposing it got out
I think the proceedings at the inquest would read worse my dear
Get up and come along at once
Oh but you know I cant
You must
Im serious
Youll die if you stop here much longer my dear child
Do you realize how cold it really is
A faint smile came over the gentle face set in its frame of fur
Poor lass I cried
What a fool I am
Give me her hand and IIl help her up
But what about Falcon
The chauffeur
She nodded
I thought for a moment then I looked for the companion
There happily were tablets and a pencil
Well write him a note said I
Wait a minute
With difficulty I scrawled a few words
Then How will this do
Falcon I have been found and taken to shelter
If possible bring the car to The Three Bulls Steeple Abbas by noon tomorrow
Will you sign it
I put the pencil into her hand and held the lamp for her to see
She wrote quickly
When she had finished I laid the tablets on the seat where they must be seen at once
When I looked at her again I saw she was smiling
So theres something in the nickname after all
What nickname
said I
Red Nat
No
Gentleman of the road Adam
Thank you Eve
If I could feel my mouth Id kiss your hand for that
As it is  I helped her to her feet and set the lamp on the front seat
Then I bade her stand in the doorway while I wrapped the rug about her
Im afraid I cant dig you a pathway so Im going to carry you to my car
I used to be able to delve once  When Who was a gentleman
Exactly
And you span
But Im out of practice now
Besides I left my niblick in London
Come along
Dont be frightened if I slip
I shant go down
Yes Ill come back for your dressingcase
The next moment she was in my arms and three minutes later we were making for Fallow at nearer thirty than twenty miles an hour
As we an into the village I heard the church clock chime the halfhour
Halfpast four
We had come well
A moment later I had stopped at the old inns door
Except for a flickering light visible between the curtains of the Cromwell room the place was in darkness
I clambered stiffly out and felt for the key I had asked for
A Yale lock in the studded door
Never mind
This door is only a reproduction
The original probably shuts off some pantry from some servants hall in New York City
However
When I had switched on a course of lights I went back to the car and opened the door
Have I said that it was a cabriolet
Eve said I
No answer I took the lamp once more and flooded the car with light
In the far corner still wrapped in the rugs my lady lay fast asleep
With some difficulty I got her into my arms
On the threshold I met Thomas our waiter
He had little on but a coat and trousers and there was slumber in his eyes
I didnt wait up sir he explained but hearing the car I just come down to see youd got everything
Miss Mansel asleep sir
I stared at him for a moment and then looked down at the charge in my arms
A corner of the rug had fallen over her face
Thomas naturally enough thought it was Jill
Er yes said I
Shes tired you know
And youd better not let her see you
Shell be awfully angry to think you got up for us
You know what she said
Thomas laughed respectfully
I passed up the stairs and he followed
Ill only open the door and see that the fires all right sir he said
I placed my burden gently on the sofa away from the light of the fire
Youll let me light the candles sir
Not a farthing dip Thomas
Miss Mansel may wake any moment
You can come and open the coachhouse door if you like
Very good sir
You can get to it from the inside cant you
Because youre not to go out of doors
Oh yes thank you sir
Two minutes later the car was in the garage and Thomas and I were making our way back past the kitchens
Outside the Cromwell room I stopped
You may take Miss Mansels dressingcase to her room and see to her fire then you are to go back to bed
It wont take a minute to serve you sir
Thomas you are to do as I say
It was very good of you to come down
Im much obliged
Good night
Good night sir
Oh  Yes
I forgot to tell you sir theres a temporary maid will wait on Miss Mansel in the morning sir
Susans had to go away sudden
I think her fathers ill sir
Im sorry for that
All right
IIl tell Miss Mansel
Good night
Good night sir
As I closed the door of the Cromwell room So Im Miss Mansel said Eve
Quite right my dear said I
One of our party my cousin in fact
When did you wake
Just as you were lifting me out of the car
I took off my cap and shook its snow into the fire
I uncover said I
In other words I take my hat off to you
Eve you are an artist
I only wish I were
Why
Id paint you here now just as you are
I know I look awful
You look perfectly sweet
I cant help it
I shouldnt try
She did look wonderful
I had put her upon the sofa but she had moved from there and was sitting on the hearth in front of the great fire
Plainly she had kept her long grey fur coat on when she had first sat down but now she had slipped out of it and it lay all tumbled about her on the rug
She was in evening dress and might have returned as I had from a ball
All blue it was blue of a wonderful shade periwinkle I think they call it Her stockings were fleshcoloured and her shoes of gold these she had taken off the better to warm her little shining feet
White arms propped her towards the fire and she sat sideways with one leg straight by the warm kerb the other drawn up and bringing her dress tight and a little away from a silk knee
Her dark hair had worked loose under the weight of the rug and was lying thick about her smooth shoulders
Save in her face she wore no jewels but two great brown stars smiled at me from either side of a straight nose
The lips were red now and her throat soft and white as her shoulders
I gazed down at her
No jewels you see Adam she said suddenly
Im afraid youve struck a loser this time
Youll have to stick to the Great North Road in future
No jewels
said I
You have a wealth of hair and what about the pearls behind your lips
Theyre worth a kings ransom
Theyre not made to take out though and theres no gold with them
She put up the red mouth and showed two rows of teeth white and even
Tempt me no more said I
Oh Eve youre just as bad as ever
After all this time too
However
I hesitate to mention supper because you look so lovely sitting there but  She stretched out a warm hand and I lifted her to her feet
For a second I held the slight fingers
Tell me one thing said I
Is there anyone who doesnt love you
The fingers slipped away
Yes stacks of people
You wouldnt like me a bit only Im not myself tonight
Im just just Eve
See
New Years Eve
Thomas thinks youre Jill Miss Mansel
To him I am
To the temporary maid in the morning too
As for breakfast oh you and my high collar must get me through breakfast and out of here and over to Steeple Abbas somehow
Funny your telling Falcon to go to The Three Bulls
Its where we were making for
Id taken a room there
By Jove said I
Then when I went back with Jill they thought it was you arriving
And I related what had occurred
When I had finished she threw back her head and laughed
Then youre not a robber after all Adam
Certainly not
But why
I mean assuming the exchange is a fair one
Fair
said I
Its exquisite
Why just to look at yous as good as a feast and  Which reminds me Im awfully hungry
Oh no no I didnt mean that Adam dear I didnt really
And my companion leaned against the chimneypiece laughing helplessly
Thats torn it said I laughing too
And now said Eve recovering take off your coat
You must be so tired
I drew my pumps out of the great pockets and threw the coat off me and across the back of a chair
Then I kicked off my great high rubber boots stepped into my pumps and looked ruefully at my dress trousers
Theyre only a little creased said the girl
You must forgive them said I
Jill wouldnt have minded would she
Jill wouldnt have mattered
Nor does Eve
Remember my hair
I shall never forget it said I
Then I picked up her little shoes and stooped to fit them on to their feet
You are looking after me nicely Adam she said laying a hand on my shoulder to keep her balance
I straightened my back and looked at her
My dear I said I oh heavens lets see what weve got for supper
And I turned hurriedly to the dishes in front of the fire
When I looked round she was lighting the candles
You mustnt go to bed at once I said pushing back my chair
Its bad for the digestion
Sit by the fire a little as you did before
Wait a moment
Ill give you a cigarette
I settled her amid cushions put out the candles and struck the red fire into flames
But where will you sit Adam
I shall lean elegantly against the chimneypiece and tell you a fairy story
Im all for the story but I think youd better be a child and sit on the hearthrug too
Theres plenty of room
A child said I sitting down by her side
My dear do you realize that Im as old as the Cotswold Hills
There now Adam
And so am I
No I said firmly certainly not
But  I dont care
Youre not
Goddesses are immortal and their youth dies not
I suppose I ought to get up and curtsey
If you do I shall have to rise and make you a leg so please dont
For a moment she smiled into the fire
Then I wonder if two people have ever sat here before as were sitting now
Many a time said I
Runaway couples you know
I expect the old wood walls think were another pair
They cant see though
No
Born blind
Thats why they hear so well
And they never forget
These four with a sweep of my cigarette have long memories of things some sweet some stern some full of tears and some again so mirthful that they split their panelled sides with merriment whenever they call them to mind
And heres another to rnake them smile
Smile
Yes
Wise whimsical fatherly smiles especially wise
They think were lovers remember
I forgot
Well the sooner they find out their mis  Hush
said I
Walls love lovers
Have pity and dont undeceive them
Itd break the poor old fellows hearts
That ones looking rather black already
She laughed in spite of herself
Then But they havent got any hearts to break
Of course they have
The best in the world too
Hearts of oak
Now you must make up for it
Come along
I altered my tone
Chaste and beautiful one dost thou realize that at this rate we shall reach Gretna next Tuesday week
So soon Jack
 languishingly
Glorious said I that is aye mistress
Remember I have six spare axles disguised as golf clubs
But what of my father
His grey hairs  When I last saw thine aged sire pipkin three postboys were engaged in sawing him out of a window through which he should never have attempted to climb
The angle of his chaise suggested that one of the hind wheels was to put it mildly somewhat out of the true
The fact that before we started I myself withdrew its linchpin goes to support this theory
My poor father
Master Adam I almost find it in my heart to hate you
Believe me fair but haughty the old fool has taken no hurt
Distant as we were I could hear his oaths of encouragement while the postboys sawed as they had never sawed before
From the way they were doing it I shouldnt think they ever had
But they will soon procure a new linchpin
Is that right
And oh Adam they may be here any moment
Not so my poppet
To get a linchpin they must find a smith
All the smiths within a radius of thirty miles are drunk
Yes me again
A man has to think of all these little things
I say were giving the walls the time of their life arent we
Have another cigarette
After which I must go to bed
As you please Mistress Eve said I reaching for a live coal to give her a light
For a little space we sat silent watching the play of the flames
Then she spoke slowly half her thoughts elsewhere You never told me your fairy tale Adam
I expect you know it said I
Its all about the princess a fellow found in the snow and how he took her to his home for shelter and set her on her way in the morning and then spent his poor life trying to find her again
Anyway one doesnt tell fairytales to fairies and and Id rather you watched the fire
Hell tell you a finer story than ever I could
At least  Yes
Well hes a bold fellow the fire
Hell say things that I cant Eve
Hell praise thank bless you al in a flash
See what he says for a moment
Remember hes speaking for me
Praise thank bless she repeated dreamily
Does he ever ask anything in return
Never said I
For a full moment she sat gazing into the flames
Then she flung her cigarette into the grate and jumped to her feet before I had time to help her
Bedtime she cried
Mine at any rate
Ill see you to your room said I lighting one of the candles
Then I picked up her grey fur coat and laid it over my arm
Adam said Eve
I looked up and across at her standing straight by the other side of the hearth the leaping flames lighting her tumbled hair
One foot was on the kerb and her left hand hitching her dress in the front a little as women do
The other she held palm downwards to the blaze warming it
I marked the red glow between its slight fingers making them rosy
Her eyes still gazed into the fire
Yes said I
If Jill were here Adam would you kiss her good night
The next morning with the help of the high collar and a little strategy my companions incognito was preserved and by halfpast eleven we had breakfasted and were once more in the car
It was another brilliant day and at five minutes past twelve we ran into Steeple Abbas
Eve was sitting in front by my side this time
As we turned into the main street I slowed down
Outside The Three Bulls stood the limousine weatherbeaten a little and its nickel work dull but seemingly all right
In the middle of the road stood a chauffeur his cap pushed back and a hand to his head
As we approached he looked away from the little writingblock and stared up at the signboard of the inn
When he heard the car approaching he made for the pavement turning a puzzled face in our direction
At that moment I heard Jills voice
Berry Berry I can hear a car coming
I expect its Boy
There was not a moment to lose
Quick as a flash I drew alongside the limousine which stood on our left between us and the hotel
Then I stopped stood up leaned across my companion and opened the big cars door
Goodbye dear I said
The next moment she had changed cars
To thrust her rug and dressingcase after her was the work of a second
For a moment I held her hand to my lips
Then I shut the door slipped back into my seat and drove on and in to the kerb
As I pulled up Jill came running down the steps of the inn
Then you got home all right Boy
Before I had time to answer Berry appeared in the doorway
Aha said he the braves return
Skaul
You are late but never mind
Skaul again my pathfinder
I thought of you when I was going to bed
Was the snowhut comfortable
I hope you didnt find that coat too much
It isnt really cold you know
Now when I was in Patagonia  Are you all ready
said I
Im just coming in to warm my hands
I followed Jill up the steps
In the doorway I turned and took off my hat
The chauffeur was starting up the limousine
And Eve was leaning forward looking out of the open window
As I smiled she kissed her hand to me
Ten minutes later we left The Three Bulls
I had thrown my gauntlets on to the front seat before I entered the inn
As I drew on the right one I felt a sheet of paper in its cuff
I plucked it out wondering
It had been torn from the writingblock and bore the message I had written for Falcon the night before
The signature was Evelyn Fairie and underneath had been added Castle Charing Somerset
With my love
I slipped it into my pocket and started the car
And how did Jilly get on
I said abstractedly as we rolled down the street
Oh Boy she cried it was so funny
Im sure they took me for somebody else
There was a lovely big room all ready and everybody kept bowing and calling me my lady
They couldnt understand my connection with the others at first and when they asked about the car and I said it had gone back to Fallow they nearly fainted
They were going to make out my bill separately too only Berry  And you didnt enlighten them
I couldnt make out what was wrong till I was undressing
And the real one never turned up
I dont think she can have
The landlord stammered something about your ladyship as I said Goodbye
How strange said I Jill chattered on all the way to Fallow
Fortunately I remembered to tell her about the new chambermaid
I was rather uneasy about the girl as a matter of fact
She must have seen Eve properly
But my luck was holding for on our arrival we found that Susan had returned
The following day January the second after breakfast a wire for Jonah arrived
When he had read it Thats curious he said
I wonder how he knew we were here 
Whos it from
said Jill
Harry Fairie the man I met at Pau last Easter
Wants us to go over to his place in Somerset before we go back to town
All of us
Apparently
You and party the wire says
I believe I met his sister once said I
You wouldnt forget her if you had said Jonah
Shes a wonderful creature
Eyes like stars
Where did you meet her
said Daphne
I seem to associate her with winter sports
Switzerland
said my sister
What year
Nineteentwelve
I walked to the door and opened it
If I told you I said you wouldnt believe me 
Then I went out
CHAPTER V THE JUDGEMENT OF PARIS I suppose said Daphne
I suppose you think youre funny
Her husband regarded his cigarette with a frown
Not at all he replied
Only theres nothing doing
Thats all
My mind is made up
This correspondence must now cease
For myself as breadwinner and  Never did a days work in your life said Jonah
And one of the worlds workers so youre wrong you see  Of course hes going said I looking up 
Only what as
Why not himself
said Jill
M no said I
We must find something out of the common
A mountebanks too ordinary
I want our party to be one of the features of the ball
Would it be asking you too much to shut your face
said Berry
Nobody spoke to you
Nobody wants to speak to you
I will go further
Nobody  Could he go as a cook dyou think
said Daphne
A chefthing I mean
They had cooks of course
Or a winebutler
They must have had  Or a birthright
said Berry
We know they had birthrights
And Id sooner be a birthright than a winecooler any day
Besides Jonah could go as a mess of pottage
Theres an idea for you
Talk about originality
Originality
said his wife contemptuously
Studied imbecility you mean
Anyone can originate drivel
Its in the blood said Jonah
One of his uncles was a Master in Lunacy
I laid down my pen and leaned back in my chair
It comes to this said I
Whatever he goes as hell play the fool
Am I right sir 
Yes said every one
A voiceShame said Berry
Consequently he must be given a part which he can clown without queering the whole scene
Exactly said Daphne
What dyou mean talking about parts and scenes
said Berry
I thought it was going to be a ball
So it is said his wife
But people are taking parties and every partys going to represent some tale or picture or play or a bit of it
Ive told you all this once
Twice corrected her husband
Once last night with eclat and once this morning with your mouth full Jillys told me three times and the others once each
Thats seven altogether
Eight with this
Im beginning to get the hang of the thing
Tell me again
His voice subsided into the incoherent muttering which immediately precedes slumber
This was too much
In silence Jonah handed Daphne his cigarette
By stretching out an arm as she lay on the sofa my sister was just able to apply the burning tobacco to the lobe of her husbands ear
With a yell the latter flung his feet from the clubkerb and sat up in his chair
When he turned Jonah was placidly smoking in the distance while Daphne met her victims accusing eye with a disdainful stare her hands empty in her lap
The table at which I was writing shook with Jills suppressed merriment
The stakes upstairs said Berry bitterly
Or would you rather gouge out my eyes
Will you flay me alive
Because if so Ill go and get the knives and things
What about after tea
Or would you rather get it over
You shouldnt be so tiresome said Daphne
Berry shook his head sorrowfully
Listen he said
The noise you hear is not the bath running away
No no
My heart is bleeding sister
Better sear that too said his wife reaching for Jonahs cigarette
It was just then that my eyes wandering round the library lighted on a copy of Don Quixote
The very thing said I suddenly
What
said Jill
Berry can go as Sancho Panza
The others stared at me
Berry turned to his wife
You and Jill run along dear and pad the boxroom
Jonah and Ill humour him till youre ready
Sancho Panza
said Daphne
But were going to do The Caliphs Wedding out of the Arabian Nights
Lets drop the Eastern touch I said getting up from the table
Its sure to be overdone
Give them a page of Cervantes instead
Jonah can be Don Quixote
Youll make a priceless Dorothea in boys clothes with your hair down your back
Jilly can be Wait a minute
I stepped to the shelf and picked out the old quarto
After a moments search Here you are said I
Daughter of Don Diego
Sancho Panza strikes her when hes going the rounds at night
She was beautiful as a thousand pearls with her hair inclosed under a net of gold and green silk
And I can be the Squire of the Wood complete with false nose
I rather like the idea said Daphne  only  Wait till I find the description of Dorothea said I turning over the pages
Here it is
Read that my dear and I handed her the book
In silence my sister read the famous lines
Then she laid the book down and slipped an arm round my neck
Boy she said you flatter me but I can sit on my hair
Then and there it was decided to illustrate Cervantes
And Sancho can wear his governors dress said Jill
Quarter of an hour back said Berry I told you that it was no good ordering the wild horses because nothing would induce me to go
Since then my left ear has been burned as with a hot iron
Under the circumstances it is hardly likely that  Oh dear said Daphne wearily
I reached for the telephone and picked up the receiver
Number please
Exchange I said there is here a fat swab
What
Swab said I
Ill spell it
S for soldier W A for apple B for Baldwin
Have you a complaint to make
Thats it said I About this swab
You see he wont go to the ball
His ticket has been bought his role chosen his face passed over
And yet  Mayfair supervisor said a voice
Thats done it said I
I mean er Supervisor
Speaking
I want to complain about our swab here
Oh yes
Can you tell me whats wrong with it 
I think its liver must be out of order
Very well
Ill report it to the engineers
Theyll send a man down tomorrow
Thanks awfully
Goodbye
I replaced the receiver and crossed to where Berry was sitting nursing his wounded ear
Theyre going to report you to the engineers I said shortly
A man will be down tomorrow
As for you said my brotherinlaw I take it your solicitors will accept service
For the others what shall I say
Just because I hesitate to put off my mantle of dignity and abase this noble intellect by associating with a herd of revellers and er  Libertines
said Jonah
Tosspots my ears are to be burned and foul aspersions cast upon a liver till then spotless
Am I discouraged
No
Emboldened rather
In short I will attend the rout
At last sighed Daphne
My dear
I ordered the supper yesterday
Were sharing a table with the Scarlets
But you neednt have burned my ear
Only means some one was talking about you said Daphne
Why did you say you werent going
A passion for perversity said I Berry stole a cautious glance at the time
The hands stood at a quarter past three
A slow grin spread over his countenance
Didnt you say something about a sacred concert
he said
Good Heavens cried Daphne jumping up
I forgot all about it
It begins at thr  Arrested by her husbands seraphic smile she swung round and looked at the clock
Berry apostrophized the carpet
Sweet are the uses of perversity he said with inimitable inflection
For a moment his wife eyed him speechless with in indignation
Then I hope youve got earache she said
Berry settled himself among the cushions
I have he said But backache would have been worse
I sank back in my seat with an injured air
The coach swayed slightly as it rattled over the points
The train was gathering speed
In the far corner of the compartment the brooch of a gay green hat winked at me over the top of The Daily Glass
Thats a nice thing said I
What
said the girl laying down her paper
Oh nothing
Only the trains run through the station I was going to get out at
Thats all
How tiresome for you
There are consolations
You would never have opened your small red mouth but for my exclamation
And I should never have exclaimed but for  Its very rude to make personal remarks
This severely
Only when the persons plain or the remark rude
Note the alliteration
What are you going to do
Obey orders I suppose
said I pointing to the door
Wait until the train stops
I think so said I looking at the flashing hedgerows
You see Ive given up acting for the pictures
Otherwise I should adjust my handcuffs run along the footboard and dive in the direction of the nearest pond
While I 
Lay perfectly still
You see I should be carrying you in my teeth
Thanks awfully
Not at all
Its a great life
Its a rotten death
Possibly
Otherwise you emerge from the infirmary to find that A Jump for Life has already left the Edgware Road for Reading and is eagerly expected at StocktononTees that the company for which you work is paying twentyseven percent and that rehearsals for Kicked to Death begin on Monday
However
I stopped
The girl was leaning back in her corner laughing helplessly
Its all very fine to laugh said I
How would you like to be carried a county and a half beyond your station
You should have asked before you got in
Asked
said I
The only person I didnt ask was the traffic superintendent himself
They said he was away on his holiday
They cant have understood what you said
I admit my articulation is defective has been ever since a fellow backed into my car at Brooklands did it twenty pounds worth of damage and then sent in a bill for a new taillamp
At the same time  Here another station roared by
I was too late to see the name
I shall swear in a minute said I
I can feel it coming
I suppose we do stop somewhere if only to coal dont we
Well we may stop before but I know we stop at Friars Rory because thats where I get out
I turned to her openmouthed
She was consulting a wristwatch and did not see the look on my face
Friars Rory was where I was bound for
We had run through the station ten minutes ago
I knew the place well
I had just time to recover when she looked up
Were late now she said
I expect thats why were going so fast
You know I said I dont believe you asked either
If this was the right train
Well Ive used it going down to hunt for two seasons
Besides I told a porter  Cant have understood what you said said I producing my cigarettecase
Will you smoke
Theres plenty of time
What dyou mean
I was going to Rory too
My dear if this train really stops there there must be the very deuce of a hairpin corner coming or else were on the Inner Circle
Weve passed it once you know about nine miles back I should think
No twelve
This is Shy Junction
We roared between the platforms
Wonderful how they put these engines along isnt it
But my companion was staring out of the window
The next moment she swung round and looked at me wildly
Gravely I offered her a cigarette
She waved me away impatiently
Have we really passed Rory
she said
Ages ago said I
Your porter cant possibly have under  She stamped a small foot bright in its patentleather shoe
Arent you going to do anything
she demanded
I am already composing a letter to the absent traffic superintendent which will spoil his holiday
I shall say that in spite of the fact that the dark lady with the eyes and the sealskin coat asked the porter with the nose  Idiot
Cant you do anything now
I can wave to the enginedriver as we go round a bend if you think its any good or of course theres always the communication cord only  I broke off and looked at her
There was trouble in her great eyes
The small foot tapped the floor nervously
One gloved hand gripped the arm of her seat
I could have sworn the red lips quivered a moment ago
I leaned forward
Lass I said is it important that you should be at Friars Rory this morning
She looked up quickly
Then with a halflaugh I did want to rather she said
But it cant be helped
You see my mare Dear One shes been taken ill and and oh I am a fool she said turning away her big eyes full of tears
No youre not said I sturdily patting her hand
I know what it is to have a sick horse
Buck up lass
Well be there within the hour
What dyou mean
she said feeling in her bag for a handkerchief
I have a plan said I mysteriously
Cant you find it 
She felt in the pocket of her coat and turned to the bag again
Im afraid my maid must have  I took a spare handkerchief from my breastpocket
Would you care to honour me by using this to er  Go on she said taking it with a smile
To brush away some of the prettiest tears  She laughed exquisitely put the handkerchief to her eyes and then smiled her thanks over the white cambric
I let down the window nearest me and put out my head
A long look assured me that we were nearing Ringley
My idea was to pull the cord stop the train in the station pay the fine and raise a car in the town which should bring us to Rory in forty minutes by road
But what are you going to do
said the girl
Wait said I over my shoulder
Again I put out my head
In the distance I could see red houses Ringley
I put up my right hand and felt for the chain
As I did so there seemed to be less weigh on the train a strange feeling
I hesitated the wind flying in my face
We were not going so fast so evenly
Yet if we had run through Shy Junction surely we were not going to stop at The next moment I saw what it was
We were the last coach and there was a gap widening slowly between us and the rest of the train
We had been slipped
I took in my head to find my companion clasping my arm and crying
No no
You mustnt you mustnt
Youre awfully good but  Its all right I said
I didnt have to
Were in the Ringley slip
And were going to stop there
Probably with an unconscionable jerk a proper full stop
None of your commas for a slip
But there
I might have known
Its a long train that breaks no journey and theres many a slip twixt Town and the North of England
However
If there isnt a train back soon Im going to charter a car
May I have the honour of driving you back to Rory and the mare
Im sure the sight of her mistress will put her on her legs again quicker than all the slings and mashes of outrageous surgeons
I take it you know your Macbeth
She laughed merrily
I looked at her appreciatively sitting opposite and perched as I was on one of the compartments dividing arms
Sunshine after rain I murmured
Sweet she looked in her gay green hat and her long sealskin coat
Beneath this the green of a skirt above the slim silk stockings and the bright shoes
Gloves and bag on the seat by her side
The face was eager clearcut its features regular
But only the great eyes mattered
Perhaps also the mouth  Youre a kind man she said slowly
And it was sweet of you to think of pulling the cord
But I should have been awfully upset if you had
The coach ran alongside of the platform and stopped with a jerk that flung me backwards and my lady on to my chest
I sat up with my arms full of furcoat while its owner struggled to regain her feet
Infants in arms need not be paid for said I setting her upright with a smile
I hope the stationmaster saw you or he mightnt believe Where were we
Oh I know
Youd have been upset would you
More upset than this
Oh much she said her eyebrows raised above a faint smile
You see then I should have been upset properly
As she spoke she laid a hand on my shoulder to steady herself while she peered into the mirror above my head
I looked round and up at the smiling face six inches away
Then I wish I had said I
One hand was settling her plumed hat
Without looking down she set the other firmly upon my chin and turned my face round and away
Open the door and hand me out nicely she said
I rose and put on my hat
Do you ever play the piano
I said suddenly
Why
I was thinking of the fingers
You have such an exquisite touch
The evident pleasure the chestnut mare evinced at her mistresss arrival was a real tribute to personality
Also the vets morning report was more satisfactory
It seemed that Dear One was mending
Greatly comforted my lady let me give her lunch at the Duck Inn
Afterwards there being no train till four oclock she came with me to choose a spaniel pup
It was to purchase him that I had started for Friars Rory that sunshiny day
What shall you call him
she said as we made our way to the kennels
I really dont know said I
What about Sealskin
Must be something in memory of today
She laughed merrily
Then Why not NonStop
I know I said
Ill call him Upset
Three black and white urchins gambolled about us flapping ears wagging ridiculous tails uncertainly stumbling about upon baby legs
Oh you darlings said the girl stooping among them caressing in turn caressed
She raised a radiant face to me
However will you choose which youll have
I leaned against the wall and regarded the scene before me
I like the big one best I said
The big one
she said standing up
Arent they all the same  The one on its hind legs said I
With the big eyes
Ah she said smiling
But thats not for sale Im afraid
Besides its tempers very uncertain as you know
Id risk that
The spaniel is renowned for its affectionate disposition
And what dog wouldnt turn if it was put in the wrong train
Besides your coats so silky
But Im sure my ears dont droop and Ive never had distemper
Then theres my pedigree
You dont know  Dont I
By A Long Chalk out of The Commons good enough for most people
Oh you are hopeless
she said laughing
She turned to the scrambling pups
Whos for a mad master
she said
Suddenly a bulldog appeared
She stood regarding us for a moment her massive head a little on one side
Then a great smile spread over her countenance and she started to sway in our direction wagging a greeting with her hind quarters as bulldogs do
Two of the puppies loped off to meet her
The longsuffering way in which she permitted them to mouth her argued that she was accustomed to being the kindly butt of their exuberance
The third turned to follow his fellows hesitated caught my ladys eye and rushed back to his newfound friend
Thats the one for me said I
Give me good judgment
I shall call him Paris
Appropriately
Off with the old love and on with the new
Im sure hes faithless and I expect the bulldogs been awfully kind to him havent you dear
She patted the snuffling beauty
Besides I gave him the glad eye which wasnt fair
Ill bet thats how Venus got the apple if the truth were known
Any way Im going to choose him for choosing you
You see
We shall get on well
Juno Juno
cried a womans voice from the house
Immediately the bulldog started and turned towards the doorway
What did I say
said I
Something seemed to tell me you were a goddess when  When
When you were upset this morning
I saw you very close then you see
Well
What sort of weather have you been having in Olympus lately
And hows Vulcan
I suppose Cupid must be getting quite a big boy
She laughed
You wouldnt know him if you saw him she said
Dont be too sure
When does he go to the Varsity
Or shant you send him
Hes there now
Doing awfully well too
Taken a first in the Honour School of Love I suppose
Is he as good a shot as ever 
Hes a very good son
Ought to be said I
Yes she said steadily gazing with eyes halfclosed over the fields and hedgerows away to the distant hills the faintest smile hung on her parted lips
Hes never given me a days trouble since he was born
I dont think he will either not for a long time any way Thoughtfully I pulled on my gloves
Then My dear said I for that boast you may shortly expect a judgment
More judgments
she cried with a laugh turning to look at me the straight brews raised in mockery
Which will cost you more my fair Olympian than a glad eye
A quarter past five
The train was passing through the outskirts of London
A bare ten minutes more and we should arrive
I looked anxiously at the girl wondering where when how I should see her again
For the last halfhour we had spoken but little
She had seemed sleepy and I had begged her to rest
Dreamily she had thanked me saying that she had had little sleep the night before
Then the eyes had smiled gently and disappeared
It was almost dark now so swift had been the passing of the winters day
Lights shone and blinked out of the darkness
Another train roared by and we slackened speed
Slowly we crawled over a bridge spanning mean streets
One could not but mark the bustling scene below
The sudden din compelled attention
I looked down upon the writhing traffic the glistening roadway the pavements crowded with hurryingjostling forms
An overlighted public house made the cheap shops seem illlit poorer still
Its dirty splendour dominated everything even the tall trams took on a lesser light
The lumbering roar of wheels the insistent clamour of an obstructed tram the hoarse shouts of hawkers crying their wares all this rose up above the rumble of the slowmoving train
I was glad when we had left the spot behind
It would not do after the countryside
It occurred to me that but a little space back some seventy rolling years here also had stretched fair green fields
Perchance the very ones poor dying Falstaff had babbled of
We slunk past an asylum a long mass dark sinister
By this even the trams seemed to hasten
I could just hear their thin song as they slid forward
Enough
Already I was halfway to depression
Resolutely I turned giving the window my shoulder
My Lady had not stirred
Wistfully I regarded her closed eyes
In five minutes we should be in and there were things I wanted to say A smile crept into the gentle face
Go on she said quietly
Im listening
I was wondering goddess if I should ever see you again
Oh probably
The worlds awfully small
Not for some time though
I leave for Cannes tomorrow to join my people
Cannes
I exclaimed
Yes
You must have heard of it
Where the weather comes from
Where it stays you mean I growled as the rising wind flung a handful of raindrops against the windows
For a moment I sat silent looking out into the night thinking
Except for a luncheon tomorrow was free
And I could cut that
A network of shining rails showed that the terminus was at hand
I turned to my lady
Then we shall meet again tomorrow I said gravely
I have to go down to Dover too
What for
This suspiciously
I rose and took up my hat
Another dog I said shortly
She broke into silvery merriment
At length Nonsense she said rising
Not at all said I
The Dover dogs are famous
Seadogs perhaps she murmured setting one knee on the cushions to look into the glass
Well youve been awfully kind and Im very grateful
And now  she swung round goodbye
She held out a slim hand
The train drew up to the platform
Goodbye
said I taking the cool fingers
She nodded
And I hope youll get a good dog at Dover she said smiling
I shall think of you
You see Im going by Folkestone and Boulogne
In silence I bent over the slight fingers
Slowly they slipped away
I opened the door
Then I turned to the girl
You know I said the Folkestone dogs
At last said Berry as the car swung into line in Kensington Gore about a furlong from the doors of the Albert Hall
A short hour and a quarter and we shall be there
Can anyone tell me why I consented to come
To please yourself said Daphne shortly
Wrong said her husband
The correct answer will appear in our next issue
Five million consolation prizes will be awarded to those who in the opinion of  Have you got the tickets
said his wife
Tickets
said Berry contemptuously
Ive had to put my handkerchief in my shoe and my cigarettecase has lodged slightly to the right and six inches below my heart
Youll have to make a ring round me if I want to smoke
Have you got the tickets
said Daphne
My dear I distinctly remember giving them to  A perfect shriek went up from Daphne and Jill
The footman slipped on to the step and opened the door
Did you call madam
Yes said Berry
Give Mrs Pleydell the tickets
Our party was an undoubted success
Jonah looked wonderful Daphne and Jill priceless
With her magnificent hair unbound her simple boys dress her little rough shoes at the foot of legs bare to the knee my sister was a glorious sight
And an exquisite Jill in green and white and gold ruffled it with the daintiest air and a light in her grey eyes that shamed her jewellery
Berry was simply immense
A brilliant makeup coupled with the riotous extravagance of his dress carried him halfway
But the pomp of carriage the circumstance of gait which he assumed the manner of the man beggar description
Cervantes would have wept with delight could he have witnessed it
The Squire of the Wood passed
And did little else
And that somewhat listlessly till he saw my lady
That was just after supper and she was sitting on the edge of a box scanning her programme
All lovely dressed as Potpourri
You were right said I
The world is small
We floated into the music
So is your waist
But then I learned that this morning
So
When you were upset
Do you like my dress
Love it
Where did it come from
She mentioned a French firm
Ah
said I Give me the judgment of Paris
CHAPTER VI WHICH TO ADORE I suppose you think Im going to swear said Berry defiantly
Jill and Daphne clasped one another and shrieked with laughter
Berry stopped addressing the ball and gazed at them
Go on
he said nodding sardonic approval
Provoke me to violence
Goad me in the direction of insanity
His caddie sniggered audibly
Berry turned to him
Thats right my boy
Make the most of your time
For you I have already devised a lingering death
Look here old chap said I theres some mistake
I said Id give you a stroke a hole not a divot a stroke
Jonah strolled up
Hullo
he said making a new bunker old man
Good idea
Only a cleeks no good
Send the boy for a turfcutter
Quicker in the long run
My brotherinlaw regarded us scornfully
Then What I want to know he said is how the Punch office can spare you both at the same time
Daphne Berry and I were playing a threeball match
while Jill and Jonah who had sprained his wrist were walking round with us
Berry is rather good really but just now he was wearing a patch over one eye which made him hopeless
It was glorious spring weather on the coast of Devon
A little village is Feth
Over and round about it the wind blows always but the cluster of white cottages and the old brown inn themselves lie close in a hollow of the moorland flanked by the great cliffs
Only the grey church set up on the heights half a mile distant endures the tempests
The wind passes over Feth and is gone
A busy fellow the wind
He has no time to stop
Not so the sunshine
That lingers with Feth all day decking the place gloriously
It is good to be a pet of the sun
So are the gardens of Feth bright with flowers the white walls dazzling the stream that scrambles over brown pebbles to the little bay merry water
Except for the natives we had the place to ourselves
But then Feth sees few visitors at any season
Sixteen miles from a station is its salvation
True there is Mote Abbey hard by a fine old place with an ancient deerpark and deep rolling woods
Ruins too we had heard
A roofless quire a few grassgrown yards of cloister and the like
Only the Abbots kitchen was at all preserved
Theres irony for you
We were going to see them before we left
We were told that in summer at the house itself parties assembled
But the family was away now
The round of golf proceeded
How many is that
said Berry as he sliced into the sea
Seven said I 
Not seven into the sea you know
Seven strokes
Youve only hit three into the sea altogether
Isnt he clever with his sums
Here give me another ball
Wheres Henry
I handed him the lastnamed a favourite cleek
The caddie had gone to collect the flotsam
Now then
Ladies and gentlemen with your kind permission I shall now proceed to beat the sphere into the sky
It was a tremendous shot and we could see that it must have reached the green but when we came up and found the ball in the hole nobody was more surprised than Berry
Of course he didnt show it
Berry doesnt give things away
Ah
he said pleasantly
Thats better
Im beginning to get used to playing with one eye
You know all the time I er seem to see two balls
Nonsense said Daphne
If you said youd been seeing two holes all day I could believe it said Jonah
Anyone might think so from the way youve been playing
Berry smiled ecstatically
My recent er chef doeuvre note the Parisian accent has ipso facto Latin of the Augustan Age placed me beyond the pricks of criticism
The venom brother which you would squirt upon me bespatters but yourself
Boy place me the globe upon yon pinnacle of sand
So
Now indicate to me the distant pin
Thank you
Do I see it
No
Natheless obsolete but pure I say nameless it beckons me
And now give me yes give me Douglas
The caddie handed him a brassie
He had caddied for Berry before
Dont breathe for a moment anyone said Daphne
Her husband frowned and silently sliced into the sea
How many balls did you see that time
said Jonah
Three said I 
Thats why hes going to pawn his clubs
The aftermath of gluttony
I spoke disgustedly
It was after luncheon and Daphne was already asleep
Jill and Jonah drooped comfortably in huge chairs
Berry sprawled upon a sofa
I suppose we outrage what you call your sense of decency
murmured the latter
You do
Incidentally you also irritate me because I shall have to go round alone
Friend your foul egoism leaves me unmoved
Go forth and harry your balls
I am about to slumber like a little child
Do you think I shall dream brother
Probably said I
About fried fish shops
Jill shuddered in her chair and Berry sat up
After that most offensive allusion he said pompously I have no option but to ask you to withdraw
The touts room is downstairs
Before leaving you may give me what cigarettes you have in your case
I smiled grimly
Then Im afraid I dont approve of ah children smoking I said moving towards the door
Besides a little exercise ll do you good
There is a box in my room you know where that is 
Where
snarled my brotherinlaw
I put my head round the door and looked at him 
Immediately above the touts said I
The breeze of the morning had died away and though the month was the month of April it might have been a midsummer afternoon
I started on my solitary round well enough pleased really to be alone
The weather was excellent company
My clubs I carried myself
The fourth hole lies in a little valley under the lee of a steep rockstudded hill whose other side falls sheer into the tumbling waves
On an idle impulse I left my clubs at the fifth tee and scrambled on up the green slope to gaze upon and over the sea below
I have a weakness for high places on the edges of England
I cannot match the dignity of them
Where yellow sands invite these do not even stoop to challenge
They are superb demigods the Royalty of the coast
As I breasted the summit I heard a childs voice reading aloud
And the people told him of all the splendid things which were in the city and about the King and what a pretty Princess the Kings daughter was
Where can one get to see her
asked the soldier
She is not to be seen at all said they all together she lives in a great copper castle with a great many walls and towers round about it no one but the King may go in and out there for it has been prophesied that she shall marry a common soldier and the King cant bear that
I should like to see her thought the soldier The reading came from beyond and below me
I fell on my knees crawled forward and peered over the top of a slab of rock
On the warm grass twenty paces from the edge of the cliff sat a little boy his brown knees propping a book
By his side facing the sea lay a girl of nineteen or twenty years her hands clasped behind her head
Her eyes were closed
She seemed to be asleep
The reading continued
And all his friends knew him again and cared very much for him indeed
Once he thought to himself It is a very strange thing that one cannot get to see the Princess
They all say she is very beautiful but what is the use of that if she has always to sit in the great copper castle with the many towers
Can I not get to see her at all
Where is my tinderbox
And so he struck a light and whisk
came the dog with eyes as big as teacups
It is midnight certainly said the soldier but I should very much like to see the Princess only for one little moment
Here the child shaded his eyes and looked down at the sands of a creek quarter of a mile away
There they are he exclaimed dropping the book and scrambling to his feet
He waved delightedly to two specks on the sands below
Then Goodbye Cousin Lallie he cried
Ill be home by six and tore away down the green slope like a mad thing
But his cousin never waked
I watched her meditatively
A skirt of greyblue tweed and the fresh white of a blouse beneath a smart coat to match
Her small grey hat lay on the grass by her side
Her slim legs were crossed comfortably and the bright sun lighted a face at once strong and gentle clearcut under its thick black hair which was parted in the middle and hung low over each temple
Her brews were straight and on the red mouth was a faint smile
I looked away over the glittering waves
Then I came quietly down picked up  Hans Andersen and took my seat by her side
I found the place and continued the story aloud And the dog was outside the door directly and before the soldier thought it came back with the Princess
She sat upon the dogs back and slept and every one could see she was a real Princess for she was so lovely
The soldier could not refrain from kissing her for he was a thorough soldier Here the girl stirred opened her eyes saw me and sat up
Who on earth  she began
Its all right said I
Its only a fairy tale
Besides Im not a soldier although I dont see  How long has this been going on
Only just begun said I
Listen
Then the dog ran back with the Princess
But when morning came  Wheres Roy
He had to go and join his friends said I 
Fortunately I happened to be here to take his place
He asked me to say he should be home not later than six
Where were we
Oh I know
But when morning came  She raised a slim hand for me to stop
Then she clasped her knees and regarded me with her head on one side
A bad end she said laconically
A good beginning anyway said I
I might be a sorceress
I believe you are
Or an adventuress for all you know
Or a Princess said I
What made you do this
Ill tell you said I
Whilst you were asleep a little smile was playing round your lips
And this smile told me that he had two twin sisters who dwelt In your eyes
And like the soldier I wanted to see them Princess
Well you have now havent you
I looked at her critically
Im afraid they must be out said I
In spite of herself she laughed
Nothere they are
Besides  What
The little smile said he had a big brother living in your heart
Yes she said softly
Yes
And that made me very brave Princess
Otherwise I should never have dared
Honestly it was all the little smiles fault bless him
Isnt it glorious here
The bright eyes swept the horizon
Yes she said slowly it is
In fact every prospect pleases
And only golf is vile
Byron never said that
I know he didnt said I
Nor in fact did Heber
He said man
All the same Im not vile
Im rather nice really
At least so one of the smaller birds told me
Not really
I mean it
Perhaps it was a skylark
As a matter of fact I said stiffly it was an owl
A breed famous for its wisdom
Ah but you shouldnt believe everything youre told
It isnt a question of what I believe but of what other people believe said I
But if you dont believe it yourself how can you expect  I never said I didnt believe it myself
Besides I dont want to argue
I want to watch the smiles playing Here we go round the mulberry bush
The girl broke into peals of silvery laughter
Is my nose as bad as all that
she said presently
Your nose is the nose of dainty Columbine said I
Dream noses they call them
And you know that mulberry bushes dont figure in that game any more than the bells of St Clement Danes are ever used by children playing Oranges and lemons
Admit it was a floater on your part and Ill let you play a round with me
I er confess upon consideration that the allusion  Thatll do she said laughing
I rose
She put out a hand and I drew her to her feet
My clubs are just by that rock there
Do you think you can manage Hans Andersen
Every time said I picking up the book
I shouldered her clubs and together we scrambled over the rise and down towards the fifth tee
Oh I told you I adored you didnt I
I said suddenly
I dont think so
Surely I did
Perhaps you were asleep
Asleep
she said scornfully
I was awake all the time
I nearly died when you began to read
I stopped short and looked at her
You are a deceitful witch
I said
A what witch
The which to adore said I
After the fourth hole the course lies inland
For the next ten holes you play directly away from the sea
Then the fifteenth takes a sharp turn to the left skirting the deerpark of Mote Abbey while the sixteenth bears to the left again heading straight for the clubhouse and the coast once more
My lady was a pretty player
I gave her two strokes a hole and led till the fourteenth but on that green she holed a tenfoot putt which made us all square
If she hadnt sliced her drive from the fifteenth tee it would have been a beautiful shot
We watched it curl over the grey wall into the sunshot park
Out of bounds I suppose said I
What a pity pretty Princess
Not at all she replied 
It was a lovely shot
You cant do better than follow that line
Into the deerpark
Why not
Its much prettier
Im sure it is said I
But what of that
Unless somebodys moved it since this morning the greens about a hundred and twenty yards away from the wall on this side
To say nothing of the fact that the parks private property while theres a noticeboard about three feet square beginning Golfers are requested to remember at the one place where a giant might effect an entrance
Yes she said quietly I got brother to put that board there
We tried to make it polite
The caddies used to frighten the deer so
I just stood and looked at her
The three smiles blazed back at me
In silence I turned and teed up
Then I drove after her ball into the fair park
When we reached the place where the board was posted she touched my hand and pointed to her little brown shoe
For an instant she rested on my palm
The next moment she was on the top of the wall
She smiled her thanks before disappearing
I followed with the clubs
There was a ladder on the other side
She was awaiting my descent
In silence we walked forward together
Presently I touched her arm and stood still
She turned and looked at me the sun making all manner of exquisite lights in her glorious hair
If I had a hat on I said simply I should uncover
The little bow she gave me would have launched another thousand ships
In the slight action all the charm of her was voiced exquisitely
Grace sweetness and dignity all in a bow
So it was always
Helens features would not have fired a sheepcote the charm that lighted them blotted out a city
Cleopatras form would not have spoiled a slave the magnetism of her ruined Marc Antony
Elizabeths speech would not have sunk a coracle the personality behind it smashed an Armada
We came to her ball first
As I handed her her brassie Tell me one thing said I
If I had not been there how would you have got over the wall
She looked at me mischievously
I have a way she said
I know I said patting her golfbag
These arent really clubs at all
What are they then
Broomsticks
It was the best part of a mile to the fair lawn where we holed out underneath the cedars
I won with fourteen which wasnt bad considering I was bunkered in a bed of daffodils
She gave me tea in the old library sweet with the fragrance of potpourri
Out of its latticed windows I could see the rolling woods bright in their fresh green livery
For nearly an hour and a half we sat talking
I told her of Daphne and the others
She told me of her mother and sisters and how her brother had cared for the Abbey since her fathers death
It was true that the family was away
She was alone there save for her eldest sisters child Roy
Next month she would go to London
Where I may come and see you
I should be very hurt if you didnt
Its going to be rather nice
It is I said with conviction
I meant the season
Ill enjoy it all
The dances and theatres Ranelagh Ascot Lords the Horse Show and everything
But  How glad and happy shell be to get back to the Abbey with its deep woodland and its warm park its gentleeyed deer its oaks and elms and cedars its rosegarden and its old paved court
How grateful to lean out of her bedroom window into the cool quiet starlit nights
How pleased to watch the setting sun making the ragged clerestory more beautiful than did all its precious panes
I stopped
She was sitting back in her chair by the window chin in air showing her soft white throat gazing with halfclosed eyes up at the reddening sky
He understands she murmured he understands
For a little space we sat silent
Then I rose
Goodbye
I said
You have been very kind
Perhaps I may come again
She did not move
Only her eyes left the window and rested on mine
Ring the bell she said 
I am going to take you to see the ruins
They are at their best as you said at sundown
Thank you I said and stepped to the fireplace
A footman entered the room
I want the key of the Abbots kitchen said my hostess
Some visitors have it madam
A gentleman called to ask for it ten minutes ago
Oh all right
She rose and turned to me
Lets go then
Well probably meet them bringing it back
The halflight lent the old quires walls a rare beauty
A great peace hung over them
Perhaps it was of them
For a little we strolled talking upon the greensward
Then Now you shall see the kitchen she said
If you please Princess
The kitchen stood away from the ruins in the middle of a fair meadow a circular building of grey stone very lofty and about sixty paces in circumference
Its great oak door was closed
I could see one tiny window glassless of course some sixteen feet from the ground
Why
said the girl stopping suddenly the doors shut Yes said I but what of that
Well the people must have gone
Why
Well you cant see inside if you shut the door
Besides if you do you cant open it again
Not from within I mean
Its a spring lock
Perhaps theyre locked in
They cant be
They might said I
Come on
I was right
As we drew near a confused murmur fell upon our ears
People talking excitedly
Then came the sound of blows upon the door
Oooh said my companion
So they are
At that moment feminine tones were raised in a wail of expostulation
Yes I shall
Its silly not to
Help
Heelp
Daphnes voice
I fell on the green grass and writhed in silent laughter
When the girl recoiled in horror I caught her by a warm ankle
Dont move
I whispered
Dont speak
Dont make a sound
Listen
Its my own party in there Berry and Co
Its the most perfect thing that ever happened
Hush
Were going to have the time of our lives
Again I rolled in an ecstasy of mirth
As the comedy of the situation dawned upon the girl she began to laugh helplessly
The knocking began again
I got up and together we approached warily
As we reached the door Im glad I had four cups of tea said Berry
How many did you have
Two said Jill tearfully
Ah I shall survive you then
Very likely I shall be alive if insane when found
At any rate with the aid of artificial respiration  Rubbish
said Daphne
Some one must hear us soon
My dear the noise we can make wouldnt flush a titlark at twenty paces
No no
he went on airily a lingering death awaits us
I only wish my caddie was here too
Is anyones tongue swelling
Thats a sure sign
Directly you feel that you know youre thirsty
Fool
said his wife Besides theyll miss the key soon
Where is the key
said Jonah
If we once lose that we shall never find it again
There was an awful silence
Then Er didnt I give it to you
said Berry
His words were the signal for a general uproar
The others fell upon Berry and rent him
As it died down we heard him bitterly comparing them to wolves and curs about a lion at bay
Then a match was struck and there were groping sounds
When youve quite finished with my feet said Daphne in a withering tone
Sorry dearest
I thought it was a bag of meal said her husband
My thoughts run on food just now you see
Here he gave a yell of agony
Get off
he screamed
Youre on my hand
Thats more like it said Jonah
That ought to carry
Mealbags dont hurt do they
said Daphne coolly
My sister is proud of her dainty feet
Vixen replied her spouse
I slipped my arm into that of the girl who was leaning against the wall shaking with laughter
Tears were coursing down my cheeks
I drew her away from the door and whispered brokenly in her ear
She nodded and pulled herself together
Then she went to the door and knocked
Silence
Hullo she said
Erhullo said Berry
I thought I heard somebody calling said the girl
Er did you
said Berry
Yes but Im afraid I must have been mistaken
Perhaps it was some boys calling
Goodbye
There was a perfect shriek of Dont go from Daphne and Jill
Then You idiot
said Daphne
Let me
We heard her advance to the door
I say she purred its awfully sweet of you to have come
We did call
You see it sounds awfully silly but were locked in
Oh how dreadful for you said the girl
Yes isnt it
Theres no keyhole this side
How awfully tiresome
Have you been there long
Oh no
Only a few moments
We just came to see the place
Well do you think you can manage to throw the key out of the window
Then I could unlock the door for you couldnt I
Oh thank you so very much
If you dont mind waiting a minute er its so dark in here and so confusing that  You dont mean to say youve lost the key
said the girl
Oh its not lost said Daphne
Its just here somewhere
One of us laid it down for a moment and really in this darkness you cant see anything
If we only had some more matches  Ive got a box I said
A long silence followed my words
Then My dear lady said Berry
Are you still there
Yes said my companion her voice shaking a little
Then I beseech you to have no dealing with the being whose vile accents I heard but a moment ago
A man of depraved instincts and profligate ways he is no fit companion for a young and innocent girl
Moreover viperlike he bears malice towards us who have shielded him for years
How awful said the girl
Yes said Berry for your own sake dear lady beware of him
And for ours too I beg you
On no account accept his proffered assistance in the matter of the key I mean
If he really has matches tell him to throw them in
Adopt a hectoring tone and he will fear you
But remember he is as cunning as a serpent Let but that key fall into his hands  Wait till its fallen into your own hands old cock said I
Dear lady said Berry you hear his ribald  The rest of the sentence was drowned in the peals of laughter to which my companion at last gave vent
I joined her and the meadow resounded with our merriment
When we had recovered a little Will you have the matches
said I standing beneath the window or shall I send for the battering ram
Throw them in fathead said my brotherinlaw
Ask nicely then
Ill see you  Please Boy dear cried Jill
I laughed and pitched the box into the kitchen
The next second we heard a match struck and the groping sounds recommenced
The girl and I strolled a little back from the window and stood awaiting the key
So its all come true said I looking at her
What has
The fairy tale
I pointed to the kitchen
There is the copper castle and here with a bow the pretty Princess
The tinderbox I have just thrown to my companions
And I suppose youre the soldier she said slowly
Yes I said the common soldier
Common
Yes dear I said taking her hand
Common but thorough thoroughly common but uncommonly thorough
And now look at me pretty Princess
She turned a laughing face to mine
Suddenly as I bent forward the eyes flashed
I suppose this is the little smiles fault too she said quietly
Instantly I released her hand and stood up smiling
No I said gently
It would have been the soldiers
For a moment she smiled back
Then she slipped an arm round my neck
Lets call it Hans Andersens she whispered
A perfect Babel arose suddenly from the kitchen
In the midst of the turmoil I seemed to discern Berrys fat laugh
The next second a large key hurtled through the window
I picked it up and strode to the door
When I had put it into the keyhole I paused
Buck up Boy
said Berry
One question said I
Where was the key
Where dyou think
said Jonah bitterly
In his pocket all the time
said I
Right said Berry
Now do your worst
Im going to said I
Im going to let you out
CHAPTER VII EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY The front door banged
Followed quick steps on the steep uncarpeted stairs and a knock on the studios door
Come in said I
The door opened and a girl in a lilac dress swept into the room
Im afraid Im awfully la Oooh
she said
If it isnt her
said I
For a moment we stood looking at one another with big eyes
Then Wheres Mr
Larel
she demanded
Hell be here in a moment
Wont you sit down
He and I are old friends
She smiled
I know she said
Hes told me  The devil he has said I
A little peal of laughter
As I feared said I
My dear youve been misled
Yes
That over there is a chair
It cost three and ninepence in the Kings Road
Local colour you know
Hes putting it in his new picture Luxury Still smiling she took her seat
Then He said you were awful she said
Till a fortnight ago I had not seen George Larel for quite five years
Not since we had been at Oxford together
When he went down he left England to study I understood
He always drew rather well
Then one spring morning I struck him in Piccadilly by the railings of the Green Park
He was standing still a large blue airball in his hand steadfastly regarding the Porters Rest
Our greeting was characteristic
Well George said I
He looked round
Hullo old chap
He pointed to the Rest
Rather nice that
Pity there arent more
Why didnt they keep the Pike at Hyde Park Corner
I shrugged my shoulders
I begged them to said I
But you know what they are
George looked at me critically
Then Thats a good hat he said
Id like to paint you just as you are
He stepped back and half closed his eyes
Yesthatll do
When can you come
I always said I would you know he added
Youre very good George
Come to the club and  He shook his head
Well talk when you come
Ive got to go to Richmond now
He pointed to the airball
There was a child there yesterday playing in the Park with eyes Ive only seen their like once before
That was in Oporto
He sighed
Will you come tomorrow at eleven
Cheyne Row
I forget the number but its got a green door
Id love to
He hailed a taxi
Thats right then
He turned to the driver
Go to Richmond he said opening the door
As it moved he put his head out of the window
Mind you wear that hat old boy
The next morning I had my first sitting
It was a great success
There was much to say and we talked furiously for three hours
And all the time I sat still upon the throne and George painted
About his work he said little but I gathered that be had begun to do well
He mentioned that he had had two or three commissions
Im on that now he said carelessly during one of my rests
He was pointing to a canvas which leaned face inwards against the wall
I walked across the studio and turned it round
A girls picture
A girl in a flowered dress and a shady hat her slight shining legs crossed at the knee
Sitting square in the highbacked chair he was painting her one small hand on each of its rosewood arms
The face was most of all unfinished
Youve got those legs well said I And I like the dress
She looks rather lovely as far as one can tell without seeing the face
George laughed
Shes all right he said
At the end of my second sitting George picked up a knife and began deliberately to scrape out all the work he had done that morning
I watched him petrified with horror
Sorry old chap he said smiling
StopI cried
I like that curve of the nostril
It denotes the force of character which has made me what I am
George went on ruthlessly
I want it to be good of you he said simply
Half way through my third sitting George gave a cry and flung off his coat
Whats the matter
said I
Something biting 
Talk man he said seizing his palette
Just talk
Dont mind how I answer
Im going to paint
By Jove how Im going to paint
Clearly the fit was upon him
These artists
Not daring to disobey I talked and talked
Heaven knows what I said
After an hour my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth but I talked on
And all the time George alternately bent his brews upon me and hung himself at the canvas uttering strange smothered cries and oaths but painting painting At a quarter past two he laid down his palette and cried to me to descend
Stiffly I did so
For a long moment I looked at the portrait
Then I turned to George and clapped him on the back
I think youre going to make a name said I
Thats right he said
And now give me a cigarette
Before we went to lunch he showed me the picture of the girl
It was almost finished
Such a fine brave face
Not a bit pretty just beautiful
Dark hair showing under the brim of the hat steady brown eyes the mouth exquisite That was three days ago
And now pleasedly I regarded the original
May I offer you a cigarette
I said
When I had lighted it for her Today is Thursday isnt it
she said
Thats just what I was going to say
Yes Im sure it is because last night brother left  The light on in the kitchen garden with the result that this morning all the cocks were two hours fast
I know
But of course it is
Hasnt Thursday always been my lucky day
She blew out a little cloud of smoke and smiled at it
Then I dont know you at all you know she said gravely and Aunt Prudence always used to say  I know
Beware of pickpockets
No smoking
They quote her in the lifts on the Tube
But then Im not a pickpocket and you are smoking
Besides your picture knows mine very well
Theyve seen quite a lot of each other lately
Yes but  And then you know my picture a little and I know yours by heart
Youre quick to learn
Perhaps
But I do
I know every eyelash long as they are
I believe I could say them
But then I was always good at poetry
This with a bow
She rose and made the daintiest curtsey
Would have been better she said resuming her seat in the depths of Luxury
But the skirts of today dont help
And my bow would have been deeper but the braces I bought yesterday afternoon  Thatll do she said laughing
Seriously where is Mr Larel and why are you here
George is probably scouring Battersea for a child he saw there last autumn with ears such as he has never beheld outside Khartoum
I am here as you are in the interest of Posterity
Did he tell you Thursday too
Certainly
I remember it perfectly
We were standing in St Jamess Square near where I get my shirts
Nobody recognized us
George had a cigar in his mouth and his exact words were Wottabow Hursday
I had some of the wood pavement in my eye and my exact words were therefore excusable
And now hes forgotten us both
On the contrary hes probably remembered
And is consequently afraid to come himself
Exactly
Well we couldnt very well overlook the insult could we
It might be wiped out in paint
I shook my head
Then French polish might do I said
But then he hasnt got any of that
However
To tell you the truth I dont know that Im very angry with him
I shall pretend to be of course
But now that from admiring the imitation I find myself face to face with the real thing I  And the rest
I like these cigarettes rather
Dear Sir or Madam said I what is it about our cigarettes that so appeals to your palate
She laughed
I dont know anything about cigarettes really but these seem so fresh
My dear said I you could have said nothing more calculated to warm the cockles of my heart
You are a connoisseurs very good indeed
These cigarettes are actually straight from the stable I mean the Ottoman Empire
I shall send you a box this afternoon by Carter Paterson
Youre very kind
But tell me why is their paper brown
Berry says its swank
But then he would
As a matter of fact its maize
I like it myself its so nourishing
Besides it goes so well with a blue suit
Talking of which with a flowered dress and dark hair its absolutely it
She stretched out a shapely hand reflectively settling her frock
White ones would match my gloves though
They would
And the whites of your eggs I mean eyes
I know
Oh and your soft throat
But  He said you were awful
You see my dear we live in an age of contrast
Women no longer play for safety in dress
They have begun to dare
And contrasts show imagination
Sometimes theyre actually striking
While matches have to be struck
Like bargains
Exactly
Theyre passive while contrasts are active
Were rather clever this morning arent you
Its the coming of summer in my case
I was in the Row at halfpast seven this morning and the air  I know
It was like hockcup out of a stone jar while the others are on the bank looking for a place to tie the punt up
I noticed it too
I was in the bathroom  Lazy
Taking off my riding boots
You see you dont give me time
I dont believe you
Hush
I feel that my tie is not straight
This must be rectified
Is there a mirror in the room
No there is not a mirror in the room
The room is mirrorless
Very well then
Either I must use the patentleather of your little shoes or perhaps you will lend me one of your large eyes
Of the two Id rather have the eye
Theres more room
Sorry the lines engaged
Shah I call you
If you please
My pet name is Birdie short for Bolingbroke
Meanwhile may I have a nail
Only one little nail
Youll have a whole palm in a minute
Which will be quite in order
I have frequently borne the palm
How many biscuits have yon taken
Seven and two buns
My sisters awfully proud of them
But about this tie
You shouldnt wear madeup ties she said severely
I sat up and looked at her
Mischievously she regarded the ceiling
Presently Note the awful silence I said
And dickeys are going out too
Look here said I I shall undress in a minute
Just to show you
These are matters touching the reputation
With that I gravely untied my tie
To my indignation she clapped her small hands with delight and gave way to quiet laughter
I nodded solemnly
Very good I said
Now I shall simply have to have an eye
No mere nail will suffice
You will have nothing of the kind
I rose and walked to the window in some dudgeon
After considerable focussing I managed to locate the environs of my collar in a dusty pane
While the work of reconstruction was proceeding Once upon a time said I  there was a queen
She was very beautiful from the crown of her little head which the dark hair kept always to the soles of her shining feet
And people loved to look at her and hear the music of her laughing
Only it was no good going on Thursday because that was earlyclosing day in her realm and she and The Mint and The Dogs Cemetery and all the other places of interest were closed
You werent allowed to see the crown jewels which she wore in her eyes Outside a taxi slowed down and stopped
Cautiously I peered out of the window
George
I turned to the girl
Here he is I said
As I spoke an idea came to me
Hurriedly I glanced round the studio
Then Quick I said pointing to a little recess which was curtained off
You go in there
Well punish him
A smile and she whipped behind the curtain
Are you all right
I whispered
Yes
Put your hand out a second
Quick lass
I spoke excitedly
What for
she said thrusting it between the curtains
Homage said I kissing the slight fingers
The next moment George burst into the room
Thank heaven he said as soon as he saw me
What dyou mean
I said stiffly
Im so thankful he said with a sigh of relief
I knew it was you
I was a fool to worry
But you know I suddenly got an idea that Id fixed Thursday for Margery Cicester
That would have been awful I said bitterly
Yes said George it would wouldnt it
I could have sworn I heard smothered laughter in the recess
But George I said how did you know I liked waiting
George laughed and clapped me on the back
I forgot
he said
Im sorry old man
But you see  One hour and ten minutes said I looking at my watch
George took off his coat and began to draw a blind over the skylight
I was very late last night he said
I gasped
Dyou mean to say youve only just got up
I roared
Oh Ive had breakfast
I picked up my hat and turned to the door
Where are you going
said George
There are limits I said over my shoulder
If it had been Miss Cicester you would have crawled about the room muttering abject apologies and asking her to kick you
But as its me  No I shouldnt
I should have said that my housekeeper d been taken ill suddenly or  Go on said I
This was better
Or that the Tube had stuck or something
Why not tell her the truth and fling yourself  You know what women are
George you surprise me
Would you deceive an innocent girl
Women are so narrowminded
They cant understandNice kid though this
This was splendid
You mean Margery er Whatshername
Yes
Shes taken rather a fancy to you your picture I mean
I laughed deprecatingly
Then Whats she like
I said carelessly
To look at I mean
Like
roared George
What dyou mean
Like I replied coolly
You know
Similar to
Well shes like that you fool
said George heatedly pointing to the picture
Ah of course
Is she really
Look here said George
If you cant  Wait a bit said I
When was she due here
I mean to say supposing you had fixed today for her to come
Eleven oclock
Why
There now I said musingly
It must have been just about then
George seized me by the arm
Has she been and gone
he cried
Well I dont know
But about an hour ago a girl did come here
Now I come to think she was something like the picture
I thought she was a model and  George flung up his hands with a cry
I stopped and looked at him
Go on he said excitedly
What did she say
Yes I know it was about then because a van had just gone up the street
You know
One of those big vans with  Damn the van
said George
What did she say
She didnt say anything
I tell you I thought she was a model
I just said you didnt want one this morning
George literally recoiled
Whats the matter
said I
Arent you well
Had she a lilac dress on
he cried with the air of one hoping against hope
Er yes said I
At that George uttered a terrible cry snatched up his coat and before I could stop him rushed out of the studio
I put my head out of the window
As he dashed hatless out of the front door Where are you going
I said
He threw me a black look
Then To wire an apology he said
I turned to find my lady at my shoulder
Hes gone to wire you an apology I said
You are wicked she said
Poor Mr Larel
I feel quite  I put my head on one side and regarded her
Nice kid though I said
I know she said severely
But the poor man  Shes taken quite a fancy to me said I
She drew back biting a red lip and trying hard not to smile
Hell soon be back I went on and then youre going to have your show
Kindly ascend the throne
All queens do sooner or later
Really I think hes had enough she said settling herself in the highbacked chair
After a little argument All youve got to remember I said is that youre awfully sorry youre so late and that the truth is you forgot all about the sitting and that by the way when you got here you met a man going out and that you dont know who he was but you suppose it was alright
Only you thought Mr Larel ought to know
Ive never met anyone like you before
My dear you never will
I am unique
And remember youve taken rather a fancy Here he is
Yes queens always have their hands kissed
All real queens I seized my hat stick and gloves and faded behind the curtains
She was really wonderful
Mr Larel will you ever forgive me
Im most awfully sorry
Dyou know I quite forgot
I suppose youd given me up
And now its too late
Oh yes
I only came to apologize
I cant think  George couldnt get a word in edgeways
I watched him through the crack of the curtains
His face was a study
Of course he was mentally cursing himself for sending the wire so precipitately and wondering how the deuce he could explain its arrival without revealing the true state of affairs
Apparently in the end he decided for the moment at any rate to say nothing about it for as soon as she let him speak he assured her it didnt matter at all and passed somewhat uneasily direct to the weather
By the way said Margery suddenly there was a man here when I came
I suppose it was all right
George started
You mean him
he said pointing to my portrait
That
cried Margery
The man youre painting
Oh no
It wasnt him
At least she added leaning forward and looking carefully at the picture I dont think so
But it must have been cried George 
He was here five minutes ago and no other man it must have been him
But the one I saw was cleanshaven said Margery
George pointed to my portrait with a shaking finger
Isnt that one cleanshaven
he wailed
So it is said Margery
For the moment the shadow  Ill never paint again
said George fiercely
Theyve hung over each others portraits for a week  Oh
cried Margery
And the first time they see one another they dont know one another from Adam
Did you find the post office all right
said I
Then I came out
One thing said Margery
Did the Tube stick
George stared at her
Then you were here he gasped
All the time said I Margery broke into long laughter
George regarded us darkly
You two he said
One hour and ten minutes said I
To say nothing of asking us both on the same day
You two said George
We two give you five minutes I said
Of these three may be conveniently occupied by your full and abject apology and two by the arranging of our next sittings
Then we two are going to lunch
It is ah some time since we two breakfasted
I made a careful note of Margerys sittingstobe as well as of my own
As we were going You know old chap said I youve never apologized
Miss Cicester knows that I am her humble servant
At any rate said I therell be the telegram
Halfway down the stairs Margery turned and ran back to the studio
When she came back she was smiling
What new mischief
I began
She turned to me with a maddening smile and opened her mouth
Then she changed her mind and raised her eyebrows instead
This isnt fair I said
You cant ride with the herring and run with the beagles too
But she would not tell me
Neither would she let me give her lunch
But the telegram said I desperately
You might let me  I dont suppose you have tea but if you do happen to be in St Jamess Street about a quarter to five  That afternoon she showed me the wire
It was as follows Thousand apologies housekeepers sudden illness detained me just learned my fool of servant misunderstood hasty instructions and refused you admission another thousand apologies two thousand in all writing
We thought it was rather good
The next morning I glanced at the clock and pushed back my chair
I must be off I murmured
Jonah raised his eyes and then looked at Berry
The latters eyes were already raised
He had begun to sigh
Whats the matter with you
said I defiantly
One moment said Berry
My flesh is creeping
Now then
How many more of these sittings
Wednesdays be the last I think
Which means that shes leaving Town on Thursday
I looked at him sharply
Then What dyou mean She I said shortly
I have known you for  Less of it said I
Much less
You know old chap said Daphne lazily you do seem suspiciously keen about this portrait business dont you
I looked at her
She returned my indignant gaze with a steady smile her chin propped on her white hands her elbows upon the table
Yes said Jonah
Afraid of being a minute late and all that sort of bilge
This is an outrage I gasped
This was nothing but the truth
It really was They were simply drawing a bow at a venture
Dont tell me  Berry began
I shant said I
Naughty temper said my brotherinlaw
Has she shelllike ears
Look here I said all of you
Must we
said Berry
Weve only just finished a heavy meal and  I have been five times to Georges studio each time solely with the object of affording him an opportunity if possible of perpetuating upon canvas my gripping personality
This was the whole truth
Guilty upon your own confession of felony said Jonah
Have you anything to say why the Court  With the same object I am going today
This was the truth
George was going to give me an hour before Margery came
Perhaps were wronging Boy said Jill
Thank you dear said I
You cant wrong outlaws said Berry
Never mind
Some day we shall know the terruth
I believe youre jealous said I
Just because you cant find an artist sufficiently dauntless to reproduce your brutal physiognomy  He means to be rude Berry explained
I walked to the door
Dont forget our lunch old chap said my sister
Youve taken away my appetite said I
Oh Boy you know we love you
I opened the door
I say said Berry
What
said I pausing
Tell George to put in the warts
Six weeks had hurried away
And then one morning I got a note from George saying that he had had my picture framed and was sending it along
I broke the news to the others after breakfast
Oh Boy
cried Jill excitedly
I want to see it awfully said Daphne
Why rush upon your fate
said her husband
I hope youll like it said I nervously
Where are we going to bury I mean hang it
said Jonah
What about the pottingshed
said Berry
We can easily move the more sensitive bulbs
If its good said Daphne well have it in the library
I object said her husband
I dont want to be alone with it after dark
I smiled upon him
Then Burrother said I
I like to think that I shall be always with you
Though in reality harsh leagues may lie between us yet from the east wall of the library just above the typewriter I shall smile down upon your misshapen head a peaceful forgiving smile
What a thought
And you will look UP from your London Mail and  Dont said Berry emitting a hollow groan
I am unworthy
Unworthy
He covered his face with his hands
Where is the Indian Club
he added brokenly I dont mean the one in Whitehall Court
The jagged one with nails in it
I would beat my breast
Unworthy
Conundrum said Jonah
Where were the worthy worthies worthy
I know said I
They were worthy where they were
Where the blaze is said Berry
The right answer said Jonah  is Eastbourne
Daphne turned to Jill
Is the trickcycle ready dear
Were on next you know
Here a servant came in and announced that a picture had come for me
We poured into the hall
Yes it had come
In the charge of two messengerboys and a taxi carefully shrouded in sackcloth
Berry touched the latter and nodded approval
Then he turned to the boys
Are there no ashes
he said
We bore it into the diningroom and set it upon a chair by the side of a window
I took out my knife and proceeded to cut the string
Wait a moment said Jonah
Wheres the policewhistle
Its all right said Berry
James has gone for the divisional surgeon
I pulled off the veil
It was really a speaking likeness of Margery
Two hours later the telephone went
I picked up the receiver
Is that sixofourosix Mayfair
 excitedly
Margerys voice
It is said I
Oh is that you
It is
Oh dyou know the most awful thing has happened
I know I said heavily
Then you have got mine
Yes
I suppose you guessed Ive got yours
You dont sound very sympathetic aggrievedly
My dear Im  You dont know what Ive been through
This tearfully
Dont I
I said wearily
CHAPTER VIII THE BUSY BEERS They never sting some people said Daphne
Perhaps said I perhaps that is because they never get the chance
It doesnt offer as they say
Oh yes they do
They simply dont sting them
M
During Lent I suppose
I murmured drowsily
A May afternoon can be pleasantly hot
Its a sort of power they have said Daphne mercilessly
I opened my eyes
The bees
Its a very offensive power
No Boy the people
They simply swarm all over some persons and its all right
I shuddered
Perhaps said Berry looking at me perhaps you have that power
Who knows
Who will ever know
said I defiantly
We can easily find out said Berry eagerly
I sat up
It is I said just conceivable that I have that power
I do not recollect my immersion in the Styx but it is I suppose not impossible that although I am not actually invulnerable my sterling qualities may yet be so apparent to the bee mind that even were I so indiscreet as to lay hands upon their hive they would not so far forget themselves as to assail me
At the same time it is equally on the cards that the inmates of the hive I so foolishly approached would be a dull lot shall we say Baeotian bees
Or an impulsive lot who sting first and look for qualities afterwards
In short mistakes will occur and as an orphan and a useful member of society I must refuse to gratify your curiosity
I think you might try said Daphne
We want them to swarm awfully and they might actually swarm on you
You never know
Pardon me I do know
I have no doubt that they would swarm on me
No doubt at all
Well then  Disobliging of me not to let them isnt it
And we could have the funeral one day next week
What are you doing on Tuesday
Well weve got to move them from the skep into the new hive tonight somehow said my sister and youve got to help
Oh IIl help right enough
Whatll you do
IIl go up the road and send the traffic round by West Hanger
We dont want to be hauled up for manslaughter
Daphne turned to Berry
Hed better hold the skep I think she said simply
Yes said her husband
Or keep the new hive steady while we shake the bees out of the skep into it
Weve only got two veils but he wont want one for that
Of course not said I with a bitter laugh
In fact I think Id better wear a zephyr and running shorts
I shall be able to move with more freedom
Ah no said Berry
You must keep the trunk covered
The face and hands dont really matter but the back and legsThat might be dangerous
Nonsense nonsense said I
Im not afraid of a bee or two
How many are there in the hive
Twenty or twentyfive thousand said Daphne
Where are you going
To set my house in order
Heaven forgive you as I do
I have already forgiven Berry
I should like Jonah to have my stopwatch
As I walked across the lawn I heard the wretched girl reading from The Busy BeeKeeper Toads are among the bees most deadly enemies
They will sit at the mouth of a hive and snap up bees as fast as they emerge Till then I had always been rather against toads
I well remember the day on which I learned of the purchase of the bees
It had been raining the night before and all day the clouds hung low and threatening
Misfortune was in the air
Their actual advent I do not recollect for when I had heard that they were to arrive on Saturday night I had made a point of going away for the weekend
On my return I avoided the kitchen garden assiduously for several days but after a while I began to get used to the presence of the bees and their old straw home I could see it from my bedroom looked rather pretty and comfortable
Then Daphne who never will leave ill alone had announced that they must be moved into a new hive
In vain I characterized her project as impious wanton and indecent in turn
A new hive something resembling a Swiss chalet was ordered and with it came two pairs of gauntlets and some veils which looked like meatsafes
Oh yes and a smoker
The smoker was the real nut
At a distance of five paces this useful invention might have been mistaken for a small cannon
As a matter of fact it consisted of a pair of bellows with the nozzle which was very large on the top instead of at the end
As touching the smoker the method of procedure was as follows One lighted a roll of brown paper blew It out again and placed it in the nozzle
Then telling the gardeners boy to stand by with the salvolatile one began to blow the bellows
Immediately the instrument belched forth clouds of singularly offensive smoke
One might think that if this were done in the vicinity of a hive such a proceeding would tend to irritate the bees into a highly dangerous if warrantable frenzy and that they would take immediate steps to abate the nuisance in their own simple way
But that my brothers is where we are wrong
Where bees are concerned the smokers fumes are of a soporific and soothing nature
Indeed before a puff of its smoke a bees naughty malice and resentment disappear and the bee itself sinks gently humming into the peaceful contented slumber of a little cheild
At least that was what the books said
Seven oclock that evening found us huddled apprehensively together outside the kitchen garden talking nervously about the Budget
All was very quiet
A fragrant blue smoke stole up gently from the smoker which I held at arms length
Berry and Daphne were arrayed in veils and gauntlets
They reminded me irresistibly of Tenniels Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Mind youre ready with the smoker when I want it said Berry shortly
I er I thought youd take it with you I said uneasily
Nonsense said Daphne
We cant do everything
You must be ready to hand it to Berry if the bees get infuriated
Thank you
Look here said I Im sure I shall do something wrong
Youd much better have the gardeners boy
And have to pay him hundreds of pounds compensation
I dont think said Berry
At the mention of compensation I started violently and dropped the smoker
When I had picked it up Look here I said  Ill stand on the path and keep the beastly thing smoking and if if they should get er excited well er there itll be all ready for you
Where
said Daphne suspiciously
On the path
And you
I shall probably be just getting my second wind
They looked at one another and sneered into their veils
Its murder I said desperately sheer murder
You ask my death
The stable clock chimed a quarter past seven
We entered the kitchen garden in single file
The hive was as silent as the tomb
It seemed almost wicked to All went well until Berry was on the point of lifting the skep
Suddenly something jumped in the wallflowers by Daphne and she started against her husband with a little scream
It was a toad
I felt braver
We were not alone
But my pleasure was shortlived
Berrys hand had been upon the skep and the jolt had aroused the bees
Uprose an angry murmur
I felt instinctively it was an angry one
My brotherinlaw had the smoker in his hand
They told me afterwards that I had gone and given it him
That shows the state I was in
I was not responsible for my actions
With all speed he applied the nozzle to the mouth of the skep
He was in time to stop the main body but a few had already emerged
I stood as if rooted to the spot
Immediately seven bees alighted on Berrys left hand
I saw them black against the white of his gauntlet
Spellbound I watched him train the smoker upon them one by one
Three rolled slowly off before as many puffs intoxicated doubtless with delight and drunk with ecstasy
The fourth one he missed
The fifth moved as he was shooting and he missed again
Then he got nervous and tried to please two at once
The sixth began to buzz and four more arrived
Berry lost his head and began to shoot wildly
One settled on Daphnes veil and she screamed
The hive began to hum again
With mistaken gallantry Berry left the bees on his gauntlet and turned to the one on his wifes veil
The next moment she was reeling against the wall in a paroxysm of choking coughs
Some more of the twentyfive thousand began to emerge from the skep and a moment later I was stung in the lobe of the right ear
The pain I may say was acute but it certainly broke the spell and I turned and ran as I have never run before
Across the garden down the drive out of the lodge gates over a hedge with eighteen inches to spare and across country like a thoroughbred
At last I plunged into a roadside wood almost on the top of a girl
She stared at me
Lie down I gasped
Why
Never mind why
Lie down for your life
She lay down wonderingly beside me as I sobbed and panted in the undergrowth
At last after cautioning her to keep quiet I listened long and carefully
The result was satisfactory
My escape was complete
I turned my attention to the girl
She was sitting up now regarding me with big eyes
Her hair was almost hidden under a bigbrimmed garden hat but I could see her face properly
Her features were delicate and regular and her mouth was small and red
Steady grey eyes
She was wearing a soft blue dress of linen and her brown arms were bare to the elbow
In her hand she had a posy of wild flowers
Little shoes of blue untanned leather I think it is
She was slender and lithe to look at and the flush of health glowed in her cheeks
Im sorry I said
It all comes of beeing
If we hadnt been beeing  And yet he doesnt look mad she said musingly
Im not mad I said
I admit that if I had on a bonnet I should have several bees in it
Happily I lost it at the water jump
Im a beer
A what
she said recoiling
A beer
At least I was one
Two other beers were with me busy beers
Stay I went on be of good beer I mean cheer
I do not refer to the beverage of that name
By beer I mean one actively interested in bees
She looked more reassured
Why were you running
I spread out my hands
The beggars were at my heels
By which you mean  That the inmates of the hive in which I was just now actively interesting myself resented such active interest and endeavoured to fall upon me in great numbers
And you escaped unhurt
Except that at the outset I was winged in the ear I have baulked them of their prey
Selah
I had an idea that the person of a beer was sacred
So it is my dear
But these were impious bees dead to all sense of right and wrong
Theyve done themselves in this time
Guilty of sacrilege and brawling they may shortly expect a great plague of toads
It will undoubtedly come upon them
I shall curse them tomorrow morning directly after breakfast
Have you reallv been stung
Every time
How exciting
Perhaps
But its very overrated believe me
Let me look
I submitted readily
After a brief scrutiny my lady announced that she could see the sting
Her fingers dealt very gently with the injured lobe and by dint of looking out of the far corners of my eyes I just managed to command a prospect of one grey eye and half the red mouth
Her lips were parted and she was smiling a little
If I didnt love your mouth when you smile I should be inclined to suggest that it was nothing to laugh about I said reprovingly
The grey eye met mine
Then she laid a small cool hand firmly on my chin and pushed it round and away
Otherwise I cant see properly she explained
Then I believe I can dig it out she said quietly
I broke away at that and looked round
She was quite serious and began to unfasten a gold safetypin
Look here I said hurriedly
Youre awfully kind but you know as it is in dont you think perhaps it had better stay in
I mean after all a sting in the ear  She just waved my head round and began
Police I said feebly
Assault and wounding stalk in your midst
Police
She really got it out very well And so you live here
she said after a while
In the vicinity said I
About a mile and a half away as the crow flies or a beer runs the terms are synonymous you know
Large grey creepered residence four reception two bed six bath commands extensive views ten minutes from workhouse etc etc
Is it White Ladies
It is
From which you now behold me an outcast a wanderer upon the face of the earth
But how did you know
Theyll be quiet by now she said ignoring my question
The bees I mean
Im not so sure
She rose to her knees but I laid a hand on her shoulder
What are you going to do lass
I shall be late for dinner
Your blood be upon your head
The bees certainly will
Nonsense
I have no doubt they are at this moment going about like raging lions seeking upon whom they may swarm
Must I pass your house
To get to the village you must
Well Im going anyway
I rose also
She stared at me and her glad smile settled it
One must die some time said I and why not on a Wednesday
It was with no little misgiving that I stepped out into the road and walked beside her towards the village
As we approached White Ladies a solitary bee sang by us and startled me
My nerves were on edge
I breathed more freely when we had passed the lodge gates
All was very still
The village lay half a mile further on
Suddenly she caught at my arm
Behind us came from a distance a faint drowsy hum
Even as we listened it grew louder
The next second we were running down the straight white road hand in hand and hell for leather
She ran nobly did the little girl
But all the time the hum was getting more and more distinct
I wondered if the village would ever come
It seemed as if someone had moved it since the morning
About the first house was the old Lamb Inn with its large stable yard
There stood a lonely brougham horseless with upturned shafts
The yard was deserted
She slipped on the cobbles as we turned in and almost brought me down
Go on she gasped
Ill  I picked her up and ran to the brougham
The humming was very loud
To fling open the door and push her in was the work of a moment
Then I stumbled in after her and slammed the door
As I pulled up the window several bees dashed themselves buzzing against it
Neither of us spoke for a minute or two
We lay back against the cushions sobbing and gasping for breath while more bees pattered against the windows
Presently I stole a glance at my companion
She was leaning back in her comer still breathing hard with her eyes shut
But she seemed to know I was looking at her for the soft lips parted in a smile
But she did not open her eyes
I laid a hand on her arm
Hows the ankle
I said
You turned it didnt you
Yes but its not very bad thanks
I think you saved my life
Im afraid thats putting it rather high
But you might have been stung so Im thankful I was there
At the same time I cant help feeling that it is to my company that you owe this this unwarrantable assault
Its me theyre after
They want to swarm on me
Or else theyve recognized one of their enemies
They said Thats a beer one of the beers
Let us slay him and the intoxicants  Exactly
Of course Berry and Daphne are dead
Its really very tiresome
With Jill and Jonah both away I dont know what on earth we shall do about tennis tomorrow
I wish we could have some air said the girl
I opened the near side window an inch and stood by to close it if necessary
But the bees kept to the other side where they crawled venomously over the pane
What ever are we to do
she said
Wait awhile said I
Excuse me but you dont happen to have such a thing as a toad on you have you
I hope not
Thats a pity I said thoughtfully
Sorry to disappoint you she said
Have you lost yours
Its all right said I
Toads are with us
They simply hate bees
Im going to get a pack of toads and hunt them
I shall advertise in the Exchange and Mart tomorrow
Hows the ankle
A little stiff
Let me rub it please
Its the only thing
Oh no thanks
Dont be ungrateful I said
What about my ear
She set a small foot on the opposite seat
I tcok off the little shoe
At length I say she said suddenly what about dinner
Dinner
I exclaimed
Oh dinners gone right out
Simply not done in the best circles
Dinner indeed
My dear you surprise me
Ah but you see I dont move in the best circles
Im only very common and vulgar and actually get hungry sometimes
Shocking isnt it
Never mind I said encouragingly
You are still young
If you begin to break off this indecent habit  It seems I have begun
Its a quarter to nine
You know it is awful
If you had told me yesterday that tonight I should be sitting shut up in a horseless brougham at the back of an inn alone with a strange man massaging my foot I should have  Of course you would
But there you are lass you never know your luck
She looked at me darkly
Needs must when the devil drives she said
I looked at her
My skin may be thick said I but its not impenetrable
But you knew that
With a light laugh she laid a hand on my arm
Dont be silly lad but put my shoe on again
As I fitted it on I heard footsteps in the yard outside
Instinctively we both shrank back into the brougham
It was quite dark now
Then a stable door grated and I heard a horse move
Who is it
she whispered
Some ostler I expect
Whats he going to do
I forget for the moment said I
I ought to know too I added reflectively
Wait a minute I will consult the oracle
So saying I made a pass or two and gazed intently into the gloom
Idiot she murmured
Hush I said
Do not speak to the man at the wheel and above all refrain from disconcerting the beer I mean seer
What do I see
A man let him pass for a man in motion
He moves
Yes I said excitedly yes it is a stable
The man moves across the stable
Lo he leads forth a horse
There now
I turned to her triumphantly
The horse you fancy madam will also run and the ah fee is one guinea
You dont fancy any horse madam
Ah but you will
Very soon too
Sooner perhaps than you But you cant help it madam
The crystal cannot lie
Pleasant weather were having arent we
No Im afraid I havent change for a note but I could send it on madam
On
On Monday you for instance  Stop stop she said laughing and putting a little hand on my wrist
Listen
Oh I say
A horse was undoubtedly led out of the stable
Breathlessly we heard it come across the yard and the next moment we felt rather than saw it put between the shafts of our brougham
My companion uttered a stifled cry and set a hand upon the door handle
Sit still lass I whispered for the love of Heaven sit still
Hes going to drive us away
Oh lad
We are in luck
But where are we going
Heaven knows
But away from the bees any way
The horse was harnessed at last
The lamps were lighted the while we cowered in the depths of the brougham the coachman mounted heavily upon the box and we rolled slowly out of the yard
Round to the left we swung away from White Ladies slowly into the village and to the left again
I kept my companion informed as to our whereabouts
Thats right I said  theres the butchers
Splendid meat he sells I beg his pardon purveys
Wears wonderfully well
Always follows the hounds on one of his own saddles
And theres the tobacconist
You should see the plugs he keeps
Ive got one I use as a paperweight
We used to think it was a piece of the original Atlantic cable
Ive had it years now and its still going strong very strong
It makes rather a good paperweight imparts a homely soupcon of farmyard life into ones correspondence you know
The PM had to give up reading my letters said they made him feel as if hed gone to the country
Ah we are now within a stones throw of the church a noble edifice complete with one bell
Hullo
Stand by with that ankle lass were going to the doctors
Youll like him rather
Incompetent but genial
Shouldnt wonder if he wants to paint your foot
He is a bit of an artist in his way
When I cut my head open last year he painted the place all over with some of his stuff
It certainly healed all right but the way the wasps followed me I might have been a private view
Now for it
You stand on the steps quite naturally and Ill manage the driver
As we drew up to the porch I opened the door of the vehicle and handed her out
Then I closed the door very carefully and looked at the coachman
His eyes were protruding from his head and he recoiled as I laid a hand the box
How much
I said carelessly
A choking sound came from between his lips and the the next moment he had flung off the opposite side and was peering into the depths of the brougham
When he had felt all over the cushions he shut the door and came and looked at me over the back of the horse
Well Im drat  Not yet I said
Dont anticipate
How much
Six months ard I should say he replied slowly and let down easy at that gettin into a private broom wiv yeller wheels an frightenin an honest man out of his blooming life
Look at the perspiration on my forehead
He took off his hat and bent his head toward the lamp that my view might be the better
I had already noticed that you were rather hot I said shortly but had in error attributed it to the clemency of the weather
But pray be covered
I would not have your blood also upon my soul
The air strikes cold
Go hon he said with ponderous sarcasm
Go hon
Hi am all ears
No no I said hastily not all
Do yourself justice man
Justice he said bitterly
Justice
I wonder you ave the face to  Be thankful that one of us has a face to have I said shortly
Among other maladies you suffer from irritation of the palm
Yes
He stared at me
Dont know about the palm in particular he said after a while but being so much with the orses it do tend to  Thatll do I said hurriedly
Lo here is a crown by the vulgar erroneously denominated a dollar
Take it and drink the ladys health before you go to bed
He took the coins greedily and touched his hat
Then he partially undressed in the traditional fashion and put them away apparently in a wallet next to his skin
I turned to the girl
Well go in shall we
I said
Theyll give us some food even if they do want to paint us
And we can ring up your people
I expect theyll be getting anxious
Oh no
This morning they went up to town for the day and theyve only just about got back
And as I was dining out they wont expect me for another halfhour
But I think  Dining out lass
Good heavens Im afraid youll have missed the soup wont you
I thought theyd given up dinner in the best circles
Ah yes
Of course
But what about the auction halma
Thats whats worrying me
And so I was going to say if youll be good enough to tell me where I am Ill make my way home to where Im staying
Before I could reply a voice that I recognized came through the drawing room window
Ah how do you do Mrs Fletcher
Sorry weve taken to up so much of your husbands time
But hes done us proud
I had fourteen
Just cast your eye your critical eye over this arm and take your pick
How do you like them
Penny plain twopence coloured
Walk up
Damn
I beg your pardon
Has the ambulance arrived
The voice was the voice of Berry
The cabs here said another voice
I can see the horses nose
I suddenly realized that Jonah had got the car and was just wondering what was the matter with our own brougham when Thats Daphne said my companion
Was it Berry who spoke first
I stared at her
Was it lad
she repeated
Yes witch it was
But how on earth
I admit Im only your second cousin and havent seen Daphne for eighteen months still after being at school in France together for two years we ought to have some dim recollection of each others tones
Why I said youre cousin Madrigal who bit me on the nose aged four under the nursery table
Are you sorry now
I did it in selfdefence lad
What was I doing
You tried to kiss me
I glanced round
The coachman had begun to undress again and it was very dark
That was a long time ago I said wistfully
Once bitten twice shy she said
As I kissed her the light went up in the hall
Put not your faith in proverbs said I Dr Fletcher opened the door
Hullo said the worthy leech
Bring forth your dead said I
He laughed heartily
Have you come for them
We have
Complete with plaguecart
Allow me introduce my cousin
Dr Fletcher Miss Madrigal Stukely
How are the deceased
Flourishing replied the leech
I took eleven out of your sister
And fourteen out of Berry thats twentyfive
I say theres no chance of their getting bee hydrophobia is there
And stinging us or anything
At this moment Daphne appeared smelling like a consulting room
Why Madrigal darling so Boy brought you to fetch us back did he
Im so awfully sorry Berry and I werent there for dinner
I hope Boy entertained you properly
I gasped
Then  Madrigal were you 
Daphne was staring at me
So our brougham had been sent to fetch Madrigal laid her band on my arm
Its all right Daphne dear
As I was going home to dress about halfpast seven I met Boy  Hurrying
said Daphne
Now I come to think of it he was walking rather  A nice brisk pace said I
Be quiet said Daphne or IIl sting you
Well resumed Madrigal I met him and he explained  About dinner
About dinner
So we didnt either of us dress
In fact we didnt dine either we were er So anxious about you and Berry I suggested
My brotherinlaw put his head round the door and looked at me
I remember he said slowly I remember catching a fleeting glance a very fleeting glance of the anxious look upon your face as you cleared the second celery bed
At the time I thought but never mind
I now realize that the solicitude there portrayed was on our account
Woman I fear we judged your brother too hastily
I was going for assistance I said
And lost your way said Berry
He turned to his wife Mdear Im afraid he will always remain a worm
What a thought
Make it toads said I
Its safer
CHAPTER IX A POINT OF HONOUR The point is  I began
The girl looked up quickly
What
This said I
Would you be alarmed or offended if I put my services  Such as they are
Such as they are thank you at your disposal
Is that an offer or a question
Neither said I
Its a point
She knitted her brows
What does one do with points
One deals with them
Mm
Well you can see what you can do if you like
You mustnt be rough with the bag
Its sensitive for all that its made of pigskin
May I have the alleged key
Thank you
It is not by force but by persuasion that I ahem gain my points
I should think youre an only child
I am I said
Thats why
We were in a first class compartment on the London South Western Railway rushing away from London down to Dorsetshire with its heights and woodland and its grey stone walls
There had been some trouble at Waterloo and it was only at the last moment that an engaged label had been torn off our carriage window and we had been permitted to enter
The other occupant of the carriage an aged member of the House of Lords after regarding us with disapproval for ninety miles had left the train at the last station
Then my lady had turned to her nice new dressing bag and had sought to open it
In vain she had inserted a key
In vain she had attempted to insert other keys obviously too large
Therein she had shown her feminism
I love to see a woman do a womanly thing
Finally she had sighed and pushed her dark hair back from her temples with a gesture of annoyance
The time seeming ripe I had spoken
Now I turned to the obstructive wards
All she had done was to double lock it and I had it open in a moment
Thank you so much
Not at all
I was brought up as a burglar
What a blessed thing the old earls left us
I suppose it is
Thank you so much
Not at all
You see if I had offered my services such as they are in his presence he would probably have challenged me and stuck your glove in his hat
She laughed
He looked rather like it didnt he
And of course according to his lights you should still be endeavouring to pull the alarm cord
Instead of which  You are going to put your feet up and smoke one of my cigarettes
Its not a smoking carriage so youll be able to taste the tobacco
Is this another point
she said smiling
No said I
Its a certainty
Her dark hair was smooth and shining and full of lights and set off her fresh complexion to perfection
This was not at all brown but her eyes were
Great big ones these with a star in each of them for laughter
Her nose turned up ever so slightly and she had a little way of tilting her dainty chin as if to keep it company
Red lips
Presently she looked at me through the smoke
Are you going to Whinnerley
she said
Yes please
To the Hall
Even as you are
How did you know
The sensitive bag had a label
Oh I believe youre one of Berry and Co Look here I said you mustnt judge me by my company
If my relatives and connections by marriage like to make themselves infamous that is no fault of mine
They have made their beds
Let them lie on them
I will recline upon my humble but separate couch
What have they done
Notorious wrong
Only last week for instance they mocked me
No
They did indeed during the savoury
As partowner I craved a seat in the car
They scorned my request
Who was I
To day they drive from Norfolk to Dorset
But for their swabhood they would have picked me up in London on the way
On the what
I admit it would have necessitated a slight deviation but against that you must set off the tone my presence lends Forgive me but theres a wasp on your left leg
She sat up with a cry
Oh take it off
Take it off
Its taste  Bother its taste
Take it off
Is it crawling  Up
Yes
Dont move
Draw your dress tight
Obediently she drew her dress close about her perhaps half an inch below a knee that Artemis might have been proud to display
I let the wasp reach the dark blue cloth
Then I seized him
As I put him out of the window he naturally stung me
Before I had time to apologize for the expletive which escaped me she had caught my hand
Which finger is it
The second
South and by east of the nail
Here
Yes
Shall I press the poison out
You can amputate it and sear the stump if you like
Good heavens your necklace is undone at the back
It isnt
It is really
Well do it up with your left hand
Ill attend to the sting
It was at this interesting juncture that the door opened and a footman stood in the August afternoon sunshine touching his cap and staring fixedly down the platform
On a station lamp was Whinnerley Bluff
How we got out of the train and into the car neither of us ever knew
When I recovered my senses she was sitting as far away as possible in an open landaulette staring at my dressingcase and her bag and moaning
Whatever must they think
Whatever must they think
They cant think weve been married long said I musingly
They only do that sort of thing on the honeymoon
She shivered
I wouldnt mind if they thought we were married but they know we arent
I suppose they do
Of course they do
Or they will
Here some children cheered as we went by
She bowed abstractedly and I raised my hat as in a trance
Whats this village
I said
Oh Whinnerley I suppose
No it isnt
Here
Where are we going
said I
As I spoke we swung through lodge gates I had never seen before while two gardeners and a smiling woman beamed delightedly upon us
We stared at them in return
It was all wrong
This wasnt the Hall and it wasnt Whinnerley
There was some mistake
The car must have been sent to meet somebody else somebody like us
And we I think we saw the streamer at the same moment
It was a large white one slung across the curling drive from one tree to another
On it were the words Welcome to the Happy Pair
As we left it behind we turned and faced one another
It was all as clear as daylight
We were the wrong pair
The right pair had never come
We had travelled in their engaged carriage
We had alighted at their station Whinnerley Bluff doubtless some new halt built since my last visit
We were in their car
We had received cheers and smiles meant for them
We were being greeted by a banner for them set up
And we were on the point of arriving at the house lent to them for their honeymoon
Thank you
Suddenly my companions words flashed across my mind
I wouldnt mind if they thought we were married
I caught her arm
Do you see what has happened
I said
She nodded frightenedly
They think were a married couple married this morning
She shivered again
Let them go on thinking it
She stared at me
Play up I cried
You know what you said just now
Well heres our chance
Only play up for an hour or two
The real ones cant arrive before seven
There isnt a train before then
We can slip away after tea
Whinnerley proper cant be far
Play up my dear play up
Its a chance in a lifetime
A wonderful light came into her eyes
Shall we
she whispered
Yes yes
Say you will
She looked away suddenly over the sunlit park
Then she spoke very slowly
Im trusting you rather a lot arent I
she said
Yes I said quietly
But since you make such a point  I took her hand
As I raised it she turned and we looked each other full in the eyes
Said I This point is a point of honour
Then I kissed her small gloved fingers
A moment later the car swept out of the avenue under an old gateway and into a fair courtyard which I seemed to have seen before in the pages of Country Life
The house was beautiful
There it lay in the hot sunshine all grey and warm and peaceful a perfect specimen of the Tudor period and about its walls a tattered robe of wisteria
It seemed to be smiling in its sleep
As we drove up to the great stone steps the studded door was opened and a manservant appeared
The car stopped
Oh Im afraid whispered my companion
Play up I whispered back
Its all right
No no
Im afraid
I dont know what to say to them
The footman opened the door and I got out
As I handed her out her hand was trembling terribly
Suddenly there was a scrambling noise and a great black and white Newfoundland came bounding down the steps
When he saw us he stopped
Oh you darling
said my companion
The dog looked at her for a moment uncertainly
Then he threw up his head and barked twice wagging his tail
She put out her hand and stroked his head
The great fellow whined with pleasure
Then he took her hand in his mouth and turned up the steps once more
Oh look
she cried delightedly
Hes leading me in
The situation was saved
I followed thankfully
As I entered the hall He has taken to your ladyship a gentle housekeeper was saying
Its not many he welcomes like that
The woman bowed to me and turned towards the staircase
Mechanically I took the two letters from the salver the footman was holding out
Then I thought of something
I looked at the girl
She was halfway up the stairs
Er darling I said
She swung round and stopped flushing furiously
Then Yes dear
I went to where she was standing
The housekeeper was twenty paces away at the top of the stairs
I spoke as carelessly as I could and in an undertone
They will want to unpack your things
Also they will soon know that there is no luggage
Ours of course went on to Whinnerley proper
Say your maid is coming on with it by the next train and that she will unpack when she comes
All right
I returned to the hall
Not to be outdone by the housekeeper the footman was most solicitous
He led me to an oakpanelled lavatory turned on the water and held a towel ready while I washed
Then he brushed me all over and flicked the dust from my shoes
With the slightest encouragement I believe he would have shaved me
Then he led me to the reception rooms in turn
When the tour was over he brought me cigarettes and asked me if I would like tea served in the garden
By all means I said
Tell her ladyship she will find me out of doors
Yes sir
I passed through the diningroom and on to a great lawn
The garden was in exquisite order
Everywhere there was a profusion of flowers and on all sides beyond a sunk fence lay the great park
Far in a cool glade I saw some deer browsing
On the left I could see the drive by which we had come
Lazily I traced its line curling away between the trees
Suddenly something red and moving caught my eye
For a moment the trees hid it from view
Then I saw it again just a flash of red in the avenue moving towards the house
I watched it curiously
It approached a small gap
The next second there appeared a telegraph boy upon a red bicycle
Thank you
Instinctively I started to head him off
I had to run to do it but I prayed that no one was looking
We reached the gate house together
Telegram
said I
He dismounted and gave it to me like a lamb
It was addressed to Maulfry Tower Winningly Bluff and it read Missed train arrive 710 Tagel
No answer said I
Then I remembered the cheering children and gave him a shilling
He thanked me shyly and sped away to the lodge gates
I turned to see the girl approaching and went to meet her
For him ginger beer said I for us tea
For them when they arrive the wagonette
They will not send the car for your maid
But never mind they have a good time coming
Isnt it all beautiful
Of course said she after this I shall go into a convent that is after I have served my term of imprisonment
I can never face the world again
Why again
said I
You see my dear were not facing it now
If we were it would be different
But now were in a backwater
In an hour or two we shall be on the broad stream of Life once more
The current is very strong sometimes
But here there is no current nor any time nor action
Only the sun makes shining patches on the water while now and again dragonflies dart through the sleepy hum of insect life like bright thoughts flashing across a reverie
Now isnt that nice
I really dont know how I do it
But to resume
No one knew of our turning aside no one will see us return
For us the universe is standing still
And theres the tea
Come madam wife sit by my side and let the world slip we shall neer be younger
She looked at me critically bending her brows
Then I should never have married you she said if I had known there was insanity in your family
Tea was set out under the trees on the lawn between the house and the drive
On three sides roses and honeysuckle screened the table from view
The fourth lay open to the sinking sun and the park and the distant hills
The footman had been joined by a butler who bowed at our approach
In silence she poured out the tea
Then Sugar
she said without thinking
Ahem
Not to day thanks dear
I had mine in the champagne
As the footman handed me the cucumber sandwiches his hand shook a little
I went on ruthlessly Talking of which did you notice the detectives
No she said
What about them
Wall eyed my dear all of them
Cost me twoandsix extra but I thought it was worth it
Worries the thieves awfully you know
They cant tell whether theyre watching the fishslice or the Longfellow
And all the time theyre really counting the marron glaces
Its called getting the wall eye
I stooped to straighten my spat
When I looked up the servants had disappeared
I glanced through the leaves to see them pass into the dining room
Gone
said the girl
I nodded
Thank goodness
And now who are you
I believe one is supposed to get to know ones husband on the honeymoon
I took one of the letters the footman had given me out of my pocket
I am said I  Sir Peter Tagel
Thats why youre my lady
Is it really
And now your alias
Ill tell you when we separate
Meanwhile I do hope I shall make you happy
When the time comes I shall win you bread
To do this I shall of course have to leave your side
But thats for after
Till then but I fear my thoughtless reference to our parting has unnerved you
You are overwrought
Lean upon me
Thats what Im for
I am your man your husband
Wheres that come from
Surrey I should think
I frowned at my cigarette
I dont think youre honouring me enough I said
Of course its early days yet but good heavens
What about the ring
What about it
Well theyll see you havent  I stopped for a smile was playing about her lips as she lay back looking into the elmtops
Then I caught her cool left hand
From the third finger a plain gold ring winked at me
I stared at it
Till we arrived at the house her hands had been gloved
I balanced her hand in my palm and looked at her
There is I said  a question
Yes
Yes
Are you married
Youve been telling me I am for the last half hour
Yes but are you really
Peter dear
This in a tone of gentle rebuke
I ground my teeth
And youre going to win me bread you know nice brown bread
I rose and stood in front of her
Still the faint smile on the red mouth
Look at me I commanded
It wasnt an obey marriage was it
This dreamily
Was that ring on that finger when we were in the train
Slowly she got up and faced me her eyes six inches from mine but still looking away over my head up at the high elms
Then she put her hands on my shoulders
Oh Saint Anthony I whispered
The smile deepened
Then Ill tell you when we separate she said
For one dear short halfhour we had wandered in the park
The sunshot glades hung out an invitation it would have been churlish to refuse
And so in and out of the tall bracken under the spreading oaks close to the gentleeyed deer we had roamed for a while at will carelessly letting the world slip
Sir Peter and his lady taking the air
And now we were back in the gentle garden facing the old grey house watching the smoke rise from a tall chimney a slight straight wisp against the background of blue
And the sun was low
I sighed
Somehow it seemed such a pity
I glanced at my companion
She looked rather wistful
Why is everything all wrong
I said suddenly
She smiled a little
Is it
Of course it is
Havent we got to slink away and leave all this
My dear its all utterly wrong
The time is out of joint dislocated It isnt really Peter
I looked at her quickly
Her eyes were wide open now and very bright
Youre right lass said I
If one goes up a backwater I suppose ones got to come down again
Only Only its been a rather short backwater hasnt it
It has been very sunny Peter
A pause then It was sweet of you to say that I said
Thank you
But as I spoke I did not look at her
I dared not
A clock chimed the threequarters
A quarter to seven
Thank you
A moment later we were arranging our escape
When retrieved our impedimenta would consist of her parasol and dressingbag and my dressingcase
My stick and gloves were in the hall and I decided to let them go
Her bag was in a fair bedroom a little brass knocker upon the door hard by the top of the staircase
She had heard them put my case in the room adjoining
Very well
She was to sit loll if she liked in the arbour where tea had been served while I ventured indoors and secured the luggage
Once across the lawn I was to drop it over the sunk fence close to the drive
Together we could then stroll towards the lodge gates
I should leave her half way come by the wood to the fence take up our chattels and join her again somewhere on the verge of the grounds close to the lodge gates
Then we could scramble over the oak palisade into the road
As I strolled towards the diningroom wheels crunched on the graveldrive
I turned to see a wagonette swinging down the avenue
There was a writingtable in the bedroom window and before I crept out of the room I sat down and wrote a few lines  To THE HOUSEKEEPER Lady Pan and I regret the unfortunate confusion for which a certain similarity of name and title has been responsible
SIR PETER PAN
Then I took a fivepound note from my case and slipped it into the envelope
I addressed the latter and put it with the two letters and the telegram on the dressingtable
On my way indoors and upstairs I had encountered no one
Incidentally I should not have minded if I had
But now it was a very different matter
Mentally and physically the luggage embarrassed me
My appearance proclaimed an exodus suggested a flight
Of course if I did meet a servant I should try and bluff my way out but There was no doubt about it this was one of the tighter places
I lighted a cigarette
Then I put the parasol under my arm and opened the door
Not a sound
I picked up her bag and my case and started
I am sure there is not another edifice in England with so many creaking boards
They shrieked beneath me at every step
At the top of the stairs I put down the luggage and listened carefully
As yet there were no lights burning and it was more than dusk in the hall below
I wiped the sweat off my forehead and began the descent
At the bottom I ran into the footman
He was very nice about it though I am certain the dressingcase bruised his shin
Then Excuse me sir he said and switched on the light
And with the light came the brainwave
I want the car at once I said
Theres been some terrible mistake
This isnt our luggage
I dont know whose it is
The label on this bag says Whinnerley Hall and thats not my dressingcase
Im not even sure that this is her ladyships parasol
Not not yours sir
Certainly not
Beastly things
I flung them down in the hall
Never seen them before in my life
Order the car man order the car
I want to take them back to the station and find out whats become of our own
The footman fled
When the housekeeper appeared breathless I was sitting on a table swinging the parasol and smoking angrily
Is the car coming
I demanded
Yes indeed sir
Itll be round in a moment
What a dreadful thing to have happened sir
I cant understand  Neither can I except that theyre both something like our things
But look at that label
This isnt Whinnerley Hall is it
No indeed sir
Well have them put in the car
Ill go and find her ladyship
Im afraid shell be terribly upset
I flung out of the house
Thirty seconds later I was explaining things to an openmouthed girl in the arbour
As I finished I heard the car coming round from the garage
Come along dear
I glanced at my watch 
With any luck we shall just catch the seventen on to Whinnerley
Remember youre terribly upset and simply frantic about your jewellery especially the tiara Uncle George gave you
Do you think you could cry
I should have to kiss you then
Again the faint smile
The next minute we were in the car rushing down the avenue
There was the white banner hanging very still now for the faint breeze had died with the day
As we approached the lodge gates I leaned forward and looked across her she was on my right looked away over the park to where the sun had set
The sky was flaming
Sic transit said I
Goodbye backwater said she
Her voice was not unsteady but there was that in her tone that made me look at her
Her lashes were wet
As the car swung out of the gates our hands touched
I took hers in mine and held it
Then I started
It was the left hand but there was no ring upon its fingers
I tightened my hold
So we sat for two minutes or more
Then Do you think they would see
I said glancing at the chauffeur and groom
Im afraid they might
But  But what darling
It wouldnt matter very much if they did would it
We reached the station simultaneously with the seven ten
As the groom opened the door Come along dear
I handed her out
Turning to the servant Bring the bag and the dressing case I added
Quick
Yes sir
A small boy waved an implement and uttered a feeble protest about tickets but we thrust past him on to the platform
There I looked round wildly
Wheres Delphine
I cried
I dont believe shes come wailed my companion
I turned to the groom
Youd better go back I said
Put those things down and go back to the car in case we miss her ladyships maid
Dont let her go off in the wagonette
Very good sir
He put the luggage on a seat and ran back to the exit
Exactly opposite to where we were standing was a firstclass carriage
As the guards whistle was blown Have you got my bag Peter
said a plaintive voice
Yes mdear and Sir Peter and Lady Tagel passed down the platform
We watched them greedily
The train began to move
The last lap said Berry
Courage my travelstained comrades
Where was it we broke down
Oh yes Scrota Gruff
Such a sweet name so full of promise so  Then he took his head in and pulled up the window
Fancy you two being in the next carriage all the time said Daphne
I expect Boys introduced himself Julia dear
Yes I thought so
Still for what its worth my brother Lady Julia Lory
Which is why shes my lady
Though she always says it isnt
CHAPTER X PRIDE GOETH BEFORE Who is Silvia
What is she
That all her swains commend he
Holy fair and wise is she The heaven such grace did lend her That she might admired be
The song and its melody floated out into the night away and over the sleeping countryside
In no way breaking the silence rising up out of it rather
It was as if Nature dreamed as she lay sleeping a dream clearcut melodious
Over all the moon hung full turning the world to silver
Never had music so fairy a setting
Then to Sylvia let us sing That Silvia is excelling She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling To her let us garlands bring Halfpast eleven oclock of a fine moonlit night and I was alone with the car all among the Carinthian Alps
It was for Fladstadt that I was making
That was the Bairlings nearest town
Their place St Martin lay twenty odd miles from Fladstadt
But in the town people would show me the way
At St Martin I should find Daphne and the others newly come from Vienna this afternoon
Friends of Jonahs the Bairlings
None of us others knew them
At ten oclock in the morning I had slid out of Trieste reckoning to reach Fladstadt in twelve hours
And till I lost my way I had come well
I had lost it at halfpast nine and only discovered that I had lost it an hour later
It was too late to turn back then
I tried to get on and across by byroads always a dangerous game
Just when I was getting desperate I had chanced on a signpost pointing to the town I sought
The next moment one of the tires had gone
The puncture I did not mind The car had detachable wheels and one was all ready waiting to be used
But when I found that I had no jackBetter men than I would have sworn
The imperturbable Jonah would have stamped about the road
As for Berry with no one there to suffer his satire suppressed enmity would have brought about a collapse
He would probably have lost his memory
There was nothing for it but to drive slowly forward on the flat tire
When I came to a village I could rouse an innkeeper and if the place did not boast a jack at least sturdy peasants should raise the car with a stout pole
Accordingly I had gone on
For the first five miles I had not lighted on so much as a barn
Then suddenly I had swung round a bend of the road to see a great white mansion right ahead of me
The house stood solitary by the roadside dark woods rising steep behind
No light came from its windows
Turreted whitewalled darkroofed in the moonlight it might have been the outpost of some fairy town
The building stood upon the lefthand side of the way and as I drew slowly alongside wondering if I dared knock upon its gates for assistance I found that house and road curled to the left together
Round the bend I had crept close to the white facade
As I turned I saw a light above me shining out over a low balcony of stone
I had stopped the car and the engine and stepped on tiptoe to the other side of the road
From there I could see the ceiling of a tall firstfloor room whose wide open windows led on to the balcony
I saw no figure no shadow
For a minute or two I had heard no sound
Then with no warning had come an exquisite touching of keys and a girls voice
To her let us garlands bring
The melody faded and ceased
The refrain melted into the silence
For a moment I stood still my eyes on the balcony above
Then I slipped noiselessly to the car picked up a rug from the back seat and laid it folded small on the edge of the cars back
Half on the padded leather and half on the cape hood strapped tight I laid it
Standing upon this perilous perch I was just able to lay my fingers upon the cold edge of the balconys floor
With an effort I could grasp one of the stone balusters
An idea occurred to me and I got carefully down
One of the luggagecarriers straps was six feet long
I had it loose in a moment
A minute later and I had wheedled it round the baluster I could clutch
Buckled it made a loop three feet in length that would have supported a bullock
I was about to soar when I remembered the car
I jumped down once more turned the key of the switch and slipped it into my pocket
No one could steal her now
The next second I had my foot in the thong
I sat on the coping looking into the room
Broad and lofty it was its walls hung with a fair blue paper
A handsome tapestry looped up a little on one side masked the tall double doors and in the far corner stood a great tiled stove for burning wood
From the ceiling was hanging a basin of alabaster an electric fitting really
The powerful light of its hidden lamps spread softened all about the chamber
The blue walls bore a few reproductions of famous pictures
Meisonnier seemed in high favour while Sir Joshuas Nellie OBrien surveyed the salon with her quiet steady gaze
A great bowl of fresh flowers stood on the grand piano
The girl herself was sitting half on the edge of an old gatetable in the middle of the room
The toe of one rosy slipper touched the polished boards and her other foot swung gently to and fro
One of her short sleeves she had pushed up to the shoulder and was looking critically at a scratch which showed red high up on her round white arm
A simple evening frock of oldrose colour dainty old gold slippers to keep her feet
Her skin was wonderfully white her hair dark and brown
This was cut straight across her forehead in French fashion and then brought down and away over the ears
Her face was towards me as she examined her arm
I could see she was very pretty
Dont you think you ought to apologize
she said suddenly
Her words took me by surprise
For a moment I did not answer
Eh
she said looking up
Yes I said I do
Fact is I havent any and the gardens are all shut now
Any what
she said letting the sleeve slip back into its place
Garlands Silvia
She smiled for an instant
Then How dare you come up like this
I wanted to see what Silvia was like
She stifled a little yawn
You heard me say she was holy fair and wise
And excelling I know
But the second verse asks Is she kind as she is fair
Well
I came up to see if she was
And is she
I dont think she is quite
Can you get down all right
In fact Im sure she isnt I said
But then  What
Shed have to be most awfully kind to be that Silvia
Goodbye
I say said Silvia
Yes
I said with one leg over the balustrade
As youre here if you would like to come in and sit down for a little I mean I dont want to seem inhospitable
I knew it said I
I knew she was really
Goodbye Silvia
Thank you very very much all the same
Ive found out what I wanted to know
I slipped over the coping and set my foot in the thong
There was a rustle of silk and a quick step on the balcony
Then two soft hands took hold of my wrists
I looked up at the big eyes the face white in the moonlight the dark straightcut hair
Wait
she said
Who are you and where do you come from
My names Valentine said I
I am a gentleman of Verona
The small mouth twitched
Be serious she said
I told her my name and spoke of my run from Trieste adding that I sought Fladstadt and St Martin
She heard me in silence
Then Are you tired
she said quietly
A little
Then I tell you that you may come in and rest for a while
Yes and talk to me
Presently you can go on
I will show you the way
She let go my wrists and stood up clasping her hands behind her head
Youre very hospit  It isnt a question of hospitality or anything else she said slowly
I just tell you that you may come in if you want to
I gazed at the slim straight figure the bare bent arms the soft white throat
Then I drew myself up and bestrode the coping
Of course I said this is a dream
In reality I am fast asleep in the car
Possibly I have met with an accident and am still unconscious
Yet your hands felt warm And your wrists very cold sir
Come along in and sit down
Even if you are dreaming I suppose youll be able to drink some coffee if I give it you
If you give it me
I drew up the thong and followed her into the room
She motioned me to sit in a deep chair and put cigarettes by my side
Then she lighted the lamps that were set beneath two little silver coffeepots standing on a tray on the gatetable
I watched her in silence
When the lamps were burning she turned and seated herself on the table as I had seen her first
She regarded me curiously swinging that little right leg
I shouldnt have liked you to think me unkind she said with a grave smile
I rose to my feet
Silvia I said
Sir I do not know what to say
Yet I want to say something
I think you are very gentle Silvia
If I were old I think the sight of you would make me feel young again and if Shakespeare had known you I think he would have written more sonnets and fewer plays
Silvia spread out deprecating white arms and bowed low
I doubt it she said
But I know he would have given me a cigarette
I beg your pardon said I handing her the box
When I had given her a light she turned again to the coffee
It ought to be hot enough now I think
Dyou mind using my cup
I dont take sugar
It will be a privilege Silvia
Milk
Please
The hot cafeaulait was very grateful
Despite the season my long drive through the mountain air had left me a little cold
I took my seat on an arm of the deep chair
Outside somewhere close at hand a clock struck twelve
The witching hour said I
How is it youre not in bed and asleep Silvia
Sleep
What with the noise of passing cars
I forgot said I
The continuous roar of the traffic here must be very trying
The congestion between here and Villach is a disgrace
I met three carts in the last forty odd miles myself
Cant something be done about it
And the curiosity of coldwristed burglars By the way I cant get over your climbing up like that you know
Its all right as it happens and Im rather glad you did but this might have been a bedroom or or anything
Or a bathroom
Of course it might
But then you see you very seldom find a piano in the bathroom nowadays Silvia
Incidentally what a sweet room this is
Do you like my pictures
Awfully
Especially the one on the gatetable
My lady blew smoke out of a faint smile
Then If it comes to that theres rather a good one on the arm of your chair she said
Yes
By the same artisttoo
But the one on the table knocks it
Thatll be hung on the line year after year
What line
At the Academy of Hearts
I beg your pardon my dear
It slipped out
Silvia threw back her dainty head and laughed merrily
Presently But the one on the tables damaged she said
Didnt you see the scratch
And the one on the chair wants cleaning badly
In its present state they wouldnt hang it anywhere except at Pentonville
But the scratch
How did you get it
Ah
That was the Marquis
We were by the window and when you slipped that strap round he jumped like anything
He was in my arms you see
Im awfully sorry but do you often embrace nobles and how do you say goodbye to dukes
I mean to say I havent got my patent with me and my coronets in the store I mean strong room but anyone who doesnt know me will tell you Besides I never scratch
The Marquis is a Blue Persian
These foreign titles I murmured scornfully
Dont be patronizing said Silvia
You know where Pride goes
Besides Ive met some very nice counts
I leaned forward
I know
Sove I Barons too
The last I strucks doing seven years now
But youre English Silvia
English dyou hear
Ill bet theyre all over you out here
I know them
Im a fool but I dont like to think of your I mean Id rather be an English er  Burglar
We both laughed and I got up
Silvia I said tell me the best way to Fladstadt and turn me out while there is yet time
What do you mean
This
Ive already been in love with you for a quarter of an hour
In another ten minutes I shall be sitting at your feet
Half an hour later  You will be just running into Fladstadt
Its straight on
You cant miss the way
And St Martin
Have you ever heard of it
She puckered her brows
Isnt that where some English people have a place
People called er Waring is it
Bairling said I
Bairling
Thats it
Lets see
Im afraid its some miles from Fladstadt
Twenty Im told
About that
And this is how far
From Fladstadt
About twentythree
I groaned
Fortythree miles to go and a flat tire I said
Now fars the next village
Why
I want to get another wheel on
If you like to wait here a little longer my brotherll be back with the car
Hes on the way from Fladstadt now
Thats why Im sitting up
Hell give you a jack
Youre awfully good Silvia
But have you forgotten what I said
About sitting at my feet
No but I dont think you meant it
If I did I should have rung long ago
Thank you said I
Of course she went on youre only a burglar but you are English
Yes Silvia
I mightnt have been though
You mean I didnt know whether you were English or not till after youd climbed up
Nor I did
But one of the mens up and theres a bellpush under the flap of the table
She slipped a hand behind her
Im touching it now she added
I wondered why you didnt sit in a chair I said with a slow smile
A deep flush stole over the girls features
For a moment she looked at me with no laughter in her eyes
Then she slipped off the table and moved across the room to an open bureau
She seemed to look for something
Then she strolled back to the table and took her seat on its edge once more
Is that a car coming
she said suddenly her dark eyes on the floor
I listened
I dont think so I said and stepped out on to the balcony
There was no sound at all
It was the dead of night indeed
I glanced over the balustrade at the car
Her headlights burned steadily making the moonlit road ahead more bright
I can hear nothing I said coming back into the boudoir
Look said Silvia pointing over my shoulder
As I turned something struck me on the cheek
I stooped and picked it up
A piece of flexible cord about five inches long
I swung round and looked at the girl
On the table a pair of scissors lay by her side
Why have you done this
I demanded
She raised her eyebrows by way of answer and reached for a cigarette
As she lighted it I saw that her hand was trembling
Silvia dear surely you dont think  Must you go
It was a poor joke of mine I know but  It was
I dont think a count or a baron would have said such a rotten thing
Her eyes flashed and she was trembling all over
From being pretty she had become beautiful
Perhaps not said I steadily
But if they had they would have meant it Silvia
As you did
I coiled the flexible cord about a finger loosed it and thrust it into my pocket
Ill go now I said as I came
Like a thief
Like a thief
You have been wonderfully kind and I I have spoiled everything
Lets try and forget this evening
For you a car passed in the night the hum of its engine swelling up only to fade again into the silence
For me I lingered to listen to the words of a song and when it was done sped on into the shadows
I wish you hadnt cut that bell lass
Why
I walked out on to the balcony and swung myself over the coping
Because then I should have asked if I might kiss you
When I had lowered myself on to the seat of the car I unbuckled the strap and started to pull it down
But the buckle caught on the baluster and I had to stand on my old perch to reach and loosen it
I did so balancing myself with one hand on the balconys door
As the strap slipped free there was a burning pain in my fingers
With a cry I tore them away lost my balance and fell sideways into the car on to the back of the front seat
I stood up unsteadily
It hurt me to breathe rather and there was a stabbing pain in my right side
Are you hurt
said a quick voice above me
Dazedly I raised my head
Silvia was leaning over the balcony one hand to her white throat
I could hear her quickcoming breath
No I said slowly Im not
But until you tell me that you know I did not mean what I said I will not believe that you did not mean to stand upon my fingers
Are you hurt lad
No
Did you hear what I said
Silvia stood up her hands before her on the coping
You know I didnt
Without a word I stepped carefully out of the car
The pain was intense
It was as if my side was being seared with a hot iron
How I started the car I shall never know
The effort brought me to my knees
Somehow I crept into my seat took out the clutch and put in the first speed
I was moving
Mechanically I changed into second third and top
We were going now but the trees by the wayside seemed to be closing in on me
The road was really ridiculously narrow
I could see a corner coming
The pain was awful
My head began to swim and I felt the near wheel rise on the bank
I wrenched the car round took out the clutch and dragged the lever into neutral
As I jammed on the handbrake I seemed to see many lights
Then came the noise of a horn cries and the sound of tires tearing at the road
I fell forward and fainted
I could smell Daphne
Somewhere at hand was my sisters faint perfume I opened my eyes
Hullo Boy
said Jill her small cool hand on my forehead
Better darling
said Daphne brushing my cheek with soft lips
Im all right I said raising myself on my left elbow
Still the stabbing pain in my right side
Where are we
In the hall at St Martin dear
How did it all happen
How did I get here
I asked
And you I dont understand
We nearly ran you down old chap
Berrys voice
About a quarter of a mile from here towards Fladstadt
But why were you driving away
I stared at him
Driving away
I said slowly
Then  There were quick steps and the rustling of a dress
Then Silvia spoke
What is it Bi11
Tell me
Whos hurt
Its all right mdear said the mans voice
Mrs Pleydells brothers met with an accident
We found him in the road
Dont make a noise
This is my sister Mrs
Pleydell
How dyou do
said Daphne
My brother seems  Im all right I said suddenly
Id lost my way see
And one of the tires went just as I was passing a big white house on the left
I stopped under a balcony I think
Thats right said Bill Bairling
Balcony of Silvias room
I never knew it was St Martin though
I must have cut across country somehow
Still
Well there was no jack on the car so I couldnt do anything
Just as I was getting in again I heard a noise above me and turned
My foot slipped on the step and I fell on my side
Couple of ribs gone I think
I tried to get on to Fladstadt
Is the car all right
And you said you werent hurt cried Silvia sinking on her knees by Jill
Was it you who asked me
I spoke steadily looking her full in the eyes
Yes said Silvia
I know I did
But then you know I dont always mean what I say
Then the pain surged up once more and I fainted
Is she kind as she is fair
For beauty lives with kindness
Love doth to her eyes repair To help him of his blindness And being helped inhabits there
The singing was very gentle
Overnight the song had floated into the air rich full vibrant but now a tender note had crept into the rendering giving the melody a rare sweetness
I listened pleasedly
My side was very sore and stiff
Also my head ached rather
Priceless voice that little girls got
said Berry in a low voice
Isnt she a dear too
said Daphne Fancy giving up her own bedroom so that we could have the salon next door
I know
But I wish she wouldnt keep on reproaching herself so
If a girl likes to step on to her own balcony its not her fault if some fellow underneath falls over himself and breaks a couple of ribs
However
Whens the comic leech coming back
This afternoon said my sister
But hell wake before then
I dont expect hell remember much about last night
Im so thankful its not more serious
How soon did he say hed be up
Inside a week
Its a clean fracture
Of course hell be strapped up for some time
Fancy his going on though
Must have been temporarily deranged said my brotherinlaw airily
Shock of the fall I expect
Rubbish
said his wife
Just because youd have lain there giving directions about your funeral and saying you forgave people you think anybodys mad for trying to get on
Boy has courage
Only that of his convictions said Berry
You forget Ive got a clean sheet
My discharge from the Navy was marked Amazing
The only stain upon my character is my marriage
As for my escutcheon Ive shaved in it for years
Fool
said his wife
I shall turn my face to the wall if youre not careful
Dont said Daphne
Remember its not our house
There was a tap at the door
Then May I come in
said Silvia
Of course you may dear
No
Hes still asleep
Its nearly twelve said Silvia
Wont you go and rest a little and let me stay here
You must be so tired
Ill call you the moment he wakes
Daphne hesitated
Its awfully good of you  But it isnt
Id love to
The truth is shes afraid to trust you Miss Bairling said Berry
She thinks youre going to steal his socksuspenders
Will you leave the room
said my sister
After you beloved
I could hear Silvias gentle laughter
Then I shall come back about one dear if you dont send for me before said Daphne
The next moment I heard the door close and Silvia seated herself on my left by the side of the bed
I opened my off eye
I lay in a fair greypapered chamber darkened for the green shutters were drawn close about the open windows
Some of their slides were ajar letting the bright sunshine slant into the room
There was once I said a fool
A smothered exclamation close to my left ear
A fool who did everything wrong
He lost his way his heart his head and last of all his bbalance
In that order
Yet he was proud
But then he was only a fool
But he was English she murmured
YesI said
And there was another fool said Silvia
A much bigger one really because although she never lost her way or her head or her balance she lost something much more precious
She lost her temper
But not her voice said I
And the fools went together to Scotland Yard and there they found the way and the head and the balance and the temper
But not the heart Silvia
Plural said Silvia softly
I opened my near eye and turned my head
The first thing I saw was a rosy arm lying on the edge of my pillow
Within reach
I say I whispered
Is the bell in this room all right
CHAPTER XI THE LOVE SCENE When I had drawn blood for the third time I felt that honour was satisfied so I cleaned the safety razor carefully and put it away
Quarter of an hour later I entered the diningroom
I said so said Daphne
I know said I frowning
You dont even know what I said
I know that some surmise of yours has proved correct which is enough
The coffee really was hot
After drinking a little my smile returned
Tell him said Berry
Weve been thinking it over said Daphne and weve come to the conclusion that youd better call
On whom
For what
Be callboy
I rose to my feet
Ladies and gentlemen I said  I have to thank you this day it is meant for a day isnt it I for the honour you have done me
Although I can scarcely hope to sustain the role in a manner worthy of the best traditions of  Wed cast you for something else if it was safe said Daphne
You dont really think Im going to call do you
Why not
And have to stand in the wings while you all get crowds of cabbages and things
Not much
Ive been relying on this show ever since Berry trod on the big marrow
Well of course there is Buckingham said Berry
Or the soothsayer said Jill
You are now talking I said
Soothsaying is one of my fortes my Martello tower in fact
Of course Hurlingham  Buckingham stupid
Well Buckingham then has his points
Whom does he espouse
He doesnt espouse anyone
Whom does he love then
Berry and Daphne looked uneasily at one another
I turned to Jonah who was deep in The Sportsman
Whos Buckingham in love with Jonah Down and four to play
What
said that worthy
Oh Buckingham
Hes hanging round the Queen mostly I think but hes got two or three other irons in the fire
I will play Hurl Buckingham said I
When Berry had finished I reminded him that he had suggested the part and that my mind was made up
After a lengthy argument in the course of which Berry drew a stage on the tablecloth to show why it was I couldnt act Oh well I suppose hed better play it said Daphne but I scent trouble
Thats right I said
Let me have a copy of the play
Berry rose and walked towards the door
With his fingers on the handle he turned
If you dont know what some of the hard words mean he said I shall be in the library
Why in the library
said Daphne
Im going to write in another scene
Another scene
Well an epilogue then
Whats it going to be
Buckinghams murder said Berry
I can see it all
It will be hideously realistic
All women and children will have to leave the theatre
As he went out I expect the Duke will fight desperately said I Berry put his head round the door
No he said  thats the dastardly part of it
It is from behind that his brains are dashed out with a club
I stretched out my hand for a roll
Do you know how a log falls
said Berry
Because if  I could not get Daphne to see that if Berry had not withdrawn his head the roll would not have hit the Sargent
However
The good works of which Daphne is sometimes full occasionally overflow and deluge those in her immediate vicinity
Very well then
A local institution whose particular function has for the moment escaped me suddenly required funds
Perhaps I should say that it was suddenly noised abroad that this was the case for it was one of the kind that is always in this uncomfortable plight
If one day someone were to present it with a million pounds and four billiard tables next week we should be asked to subscribe to a fund to buy it a bagatelle board
At any rate in a burst of generosity Daphne had undertaken that we would get up a show
When she told us of her involving promise we were appalled
A show
gasped Jonah
Yes said Berry
You know a show  display
We are to exhibit us to a horrified assembly
But Daphne darling said Jill
What have you done
Its all right said my sister
We can do a play
A little one you know and the Merrows will help
Of course said Berry
Some telling trifle or other
Cant we dramatize The Inchcape Rock
Excellent said I
I should like to play the abbot
It would be rather suitable too
If you remember they blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok
Why not
said Berry
We could have a very fervent little scene with them all blessing you
And perhaps Heath Robinson would paint the scenery
And so on
In the end Berry and Jonah had constructed quite a passable little drama by dint of drawing largely on Dumas in the first place and their own imagination in the second
There were one or two strong situations relieved by some quite creditable light comedy and all the curtains were good
The village hall complete with alleged stage was engaged and half the county were blackmailed into taking tickets
There were only twelve characters of which we accounted for five and it was arranged that we should all twelve foregather four days beforehand to rehearse properly
The other seven artists were to stay with us at White Ladies for the rehearsals and performance and generally till the affair had blown over
It was ten days before the date of the production that I was cast for Buckingham
Six days to become word perfect
When three of them had gone I explained to the others that for all their jealousy they would find that I should succeed in getting into the skin of the part and that as it was impossible to polish my study of George Villiers in the teeth of interference which refused to respect the privacy even of my own bedroom I should go apart with Pomfret and perfect my rendering in the shelter of the countryside
Have pity upon our animal life
cried Berry when I made known my intention
Consider the flora and fauna of our happy shire
Hush brother said I
You know not what you say
I shall not seek the fields
Rather  Thats something
We dont want you hauled up for sheepworrying just now
 shall I repair to some sequestered grove
There when I shall commune with myself Nature will go astray
Springtime will come again
Trees will break forth into blossom meadows will blow anew and the voice of the turtle  If you dont ring off said Berry
Ill set George at you
George is our gorgonzola which brings me back to Pomfret
Pomfret is a little twoseater
I got him because I thought hed be so useful just to run to and fro when the car was out
And he is
We made friends at Olympia and I took to him at once
A fortnight later Jill was driving him delightedly round and round in front of the house
After watching her for a while Berry got in and sat down by her side
Not that I want a drive he explained carefully but I want to see if my dressingcase will be able to stand it as far as the station
If you think I began but the next moment Jill had turned down the drive and I watched the three go curling out of sight
When they returned half an hour later Berry unreservedly withdrew his remark about the dressingcase and the next day when Daphne suggested that Pomfret should bear a small basket of grapes to the vicarage he told her she ought to be ashamed of herself
From that day Pomfret was one of us
And now with three days left to learn my words and a copy of the play in my pocket I drove forth into the countryside
When I had idly covered about twenty miles I turned down a little lane and pulled up by the side of a still wood
I stopped the engine and listened
Not a sound
I left the road and strolled in among the trees till I came to where one lay felled making a little space
It was a sunshiny morning in October and summer was dying hard
For the most part the soft colourings of autumn were absent and as if loyal to their old mistress the woods yet wore the dear green livery faded a little perhaps but the more grateful because it should so soon be laid aside
The pleasant place suited my purpose well and for twenty minutes I wrestled with the powerful little scene Jonah had written between the Queen and Buckingham
By the end of that time I knew it fairly well so I left it for a while and stealthily entered the old oak chamber Act III Scene I by the secret door behind the arras
After bringing down the curtain with two ugly looks four steps and a sneer I sat down on the fallen beechtree lighted a cigarette and wondered why I had rejected the post of callboy
Then I started on the lovescene again
Madam it is said that I am a harsh man
I am not harsh to every one
Better for me perhaps if I were yet so God made me
When do you open
Thats wrong said I
Can you be gentle then
comes after that
Now however that you have shattered the atmosphere I had created of course I think youre absolutely beautiful and if youll wait a second Ill get Pomfrets rug
I dont know what you mean but thanks all the same and if Pomfret doesnt mind this tree is rather grubby
I got the rug and spread it on the fallen trunk for her
She was what the Irish are popularly believed to call a shlip of a ghirl clad in a dark blue ridinghabit that fitted her slim figure beautifully
No hat covered her thick blueblack hair which was parted in the middle and loosely knotted behind
Here and there a wisp of it was in the act of escaping
I watched them greedily
Merry grey eyes and the softest colouring with a small red mouth ready to join the eyes in their laughter if its owner listed
She was wearing natty little patentleather boots and her hunting hat and crop lay on the log by her side
She sat down and began to pull the gloves off a pair of small brown hands
Do you know if cats ever drink water
she said musingly
From what I remember of last years statistics there was I believe a marked decrease in the number of alcoholism cases reported as occurring amongst that species
Im speaking offhand you know
Never mind that its very good hearing
I know and talking of tightropes Alice have you seen the March Hare lately
She threw her head back and laughed merrily
Then We are fools you know she said
Perhaps
Still a little folly  Is a dangerous thing
And now when do you open
Tomorrow week
And owing to the iniquitous provisions of the new Shops Act foisted by a reckless Government upon a  You can cut that bit
Thank you
We close the same night
Positively for one performance only
Exactly
And thats why I shall only just be able to get you a seat
You neednt trouble
What
Dont you want to come
Is it going to be very good
Good
My dear Alice we shall that night light such a candle as shall never be put out
Electric light is doomed
The knell of acetylene gas has sounded
Youve only got a few lines I suppose
I looked at her sorrowfully
Whose rug is she sitting on
I said
Pomfrets
Pomfret is but the bailee of the rug Alice
Oh she cried hes going to be a barrister
Talking of cats I said stiffly and speaking as counsel of five years standing  I stopped for she was on her feet now facing me and standing very close with her hands behind her and a tilted chin looking into my eyes
Talking of what did you say
For a second I hesitated
Then Gnats I said
She turned and resumed her place on the fallen tree
Now youre going on with your rehearsal she announced
Ill hear you
Will you read the cues
Give me the book
I showed her the point I had reached when she entered
You are the Queen I said
Its rather confusing because I had thought you were Alice but it cant be helped
Besides you came on just before you did really and youve spoken twice before you opened your small red mouth
Is that how it describes the Queen
This suspiciously
I was really thinking of Alice but  But what
The Queen has got a delicate white throat
It says so
How can you tell
Ive got a stock on
I said the Queen had
Besides when you put your face up to mine just now  Hush
Besides you were looking me in the eyes all the time so  And if I was do you blame me
Im not in the witnessbox now counsel
No but youre sitting on Pomfrets rug and Pomfret is but the  She began to laugh helplessly
Come along Alice I said
Yet so God made me
Now you say Can you be gentle then
and give me the glad eye
It only says archly here in brackets
Same thing said I Can you be gentle then
A pause
Then Go on she said
Im waiting for my cue
Ive said it Hare
John or March
March of course
John is an actor
Thank you Alice dear
I repeat I await my cue the which you incontinently withhold
Selah
She tried not to laugh
Ive given it you silly man
My dear I come in on the eye
Its most important
You must give it to me because Ive got to give it back to you in a second or two
She gave it me exquisitely
There are with whom I can be more than gentle madam
Here I returned the eye with vigour
What manner of men are these you favour
They are not men madam
Neither are they favoured of me
Of whom then
Of Heaven madam and at birth
I mean fair women
Such as  Such as you madam
The way she said Hush
at that was a flash of genius
It was indescribably eloquent
She forbade and invited in the same breath
It was wonderful and it made me Buckingham
And Buckingham it brought to her feet
Little wonder
It would have brought a cardinal
In the passionate rhetoric of my lines I wooed her sitting there on the tree trunk her head thrown back eyes closed lips parted and always the faint smile that sends a man mad
I never had to tell her to rise
To the line she swayed towards me
To the line she slipped into my arms
She even raised her lips to mine at the last
Then as I stooped for the kiss she placed her two small hands firmly on my face and pushed me away
Very nice indeed she said
You know your lines well and you know how to speak them
Hare I think youre going to be rather good
I wiped the perspiration off my forehead
You made me good then
I shall never give such a show again
Of course you will
Never
Never Alice
But you youre wonderful
Good Heavens lass this might be the two hundredth night youd played the part
Are you some great one Ive not recognized
And will you sign a picturepostcard for our second housemaid the one who saw BuzzBuzz  eighteen times
What
Not the one with fair hair
And flat feet
The very one
Junket her name is
By Curds out of Season
My mistake
I was thinking of our beagle
Dont think Im quite mad
Im only drunk
Youre the wine
The Queen is you mean
No no you Alice
She looked at her wristwatch
Oh all right I said
The Queens the wine the plays the thing
Anything you like
Only Im tired of playacting and I only want to talk to Alice
Come and let me introduce Pomfret
He hasnt been here all the time
Waiting in the road
Oh hes a horse
I laughed by way of answer and we walked to where Pomfret stood patient immobile
I introduced him elaborately
My lady swept him a curtsey
I have to thank you for lending me your rug Pomfret she said
I replied for the little chap Its not my rug I am but the bail  Thats all right
Is your master nice to you
But yes lady
Dont you like him
He seems to mean well
Isnt that rather unkind
said Pomfret
Im not in the witnessbox now
Then theres no reason why you shouldnt tell the truth
Really Pomfret
Forgive me Alice
Im only a young car and sometimes when the petrol gets into my tank  I hope you dont take more than you should
Im sober enough to see youve got a fine pair of headlights
Im afraid youre of rather a comingon disposition Pomfret
Oh I can do my thirtyfive
His licence will show you that
Oh Pomfret did you get it endorsed
It was his own fault
Kept egging me on all the time and then when we were stopped tells the police that its a physical impossibility for me to do more than fifteen
And I had to stand there and hear him say it
He told me afterwards that it was only a facon de parler but I was angry
I simply shook with anger the radiator was boiling too and one of the tires burst with rage
And I suppose the petrol pipe was choked with emotion
And the engine almost throttled in consequence
But that is another story
And now wont you let me take you for a little run
My clutch is not at all fierce
My companion leaned against Pomfrets hood and laughed
Hes a bit of a nut isnt he
said I
Do you think hes quite safe
Rather
Besides I shall be with you
Thats not saying much
Thank you
And talking of gurnats  Where will you take me
Whithersoever she listed
Is it far from here to Tendon Harrow
About sixteen miles
Would you mind Hare
You know Id love it
I started up Pomfret and we settled ourselves in the car
As luck would have it I had a second coat with me and she said she was quite warm and comfortable
Presently she told me all that had happened
In the morning she had ridden alone to hounds
The meet had been at Will Cross
The mare was keen and for a few miles all went well
Then the hounds had split
Most of the field had followed the master but she and a few others had followed the huntsman
After a while she had dropped a little behind
Then there had been a check
She had seized upon the opportunity it afforded her to slip off and tighten her girths
Wasnt there any man there to  Wait
The next second the hounds picked up the scent again and before I knew where I was the mare had jerked the bridle out of my hand and was halfway across the first field
And didnt anyone catch her
The man who caught her is a brute
He would have wanted to tighten my girths for me and thats why I dropped behind
I felt it would be him so I slid out of sight behind a hedge and when I saw it was him coming back with her I didnt want his smile so I just ran into the woods and started to walk home
Did he see you
No
He may be there still for all I know
He must have been having a roaring time leading the mare about all day
I hope itll teach him not to pester a girl again
I sighed
Some of us are brutes arent we
Yes
A pause
Then But some men have been very nice to me
The devil they have
said I
Here as certain of our own writers say and have said a gurgle of delight escaped her
I leaned forward and grabbed at something caught and handed it to her
She stared at my empty palm
Your gurgle I think
Oh she said laughing you are mad
But I like you
Now why is that
Personal charm said I
The palmist who sits where the draughts are in the Brown Park Hotel West Central said I had a magnetism of my own
There you are
I never believed in palmistry
She also told me to beware of lifts and a fellow trod on one of my spats in the one at Dover Street the very next morning
Hullo
Pomfret slowed gradually down and stopped
I turned to the girl
This is what we pay the boy sixteen shillings a week for
Whats the matter
Petrols run out
Im awfully sorry
The silly serf must have forgotten to fill up before I started
My dear Hare what shall we do
I made a rapid calculation
We cant be more than a quarter of a mile from Fell
In fact Im almost sure its at the foot of the next hill
Yes I know it is
And if we can get Pomfret to the crest of this rise its all downhill from there to the village
Shall we try Alice
Rather
She got out and I followed
Fortunately the slope was a gentle one and without much of the harder labour we managed to top the rise
Then we got in again and began to descend the hill
When the brakes failed one after another I was if possible more pained than surprised
I rebuked Pomfret and turned to my companion Do you mind making ready to die
I said 
Im sorry but if we dont take the next corner Im afraid we shall be what is called found later
We took it on two wheels and I then ran Pomfrets near front wheel on to the low bank by the side of the road
Put your arms round my neck I cried
She did so and the next moment we plunged into the bushes
I heard a wing snap and the car seemed to mount a little into the air then we stopped at a nasty angle for the off hind wheel was yet in the channel
I breathed a sigh of relief
Then still grasping the wheel I looked down at my left shoulder
I love Harris tweeds said the girl quietly
Its just as well isnt it
All things considered it was
Her nose was embedded in the cloth about two inches above my left breastpocket
In silence I kissed her hair four times
Then I confess I said that the real blueblack hair has always been a weakness of mine
At that she struggled to rise but the angle was against her and honestly I couldnt do much
The next minute she had found the edge of the windscreen fortunately open at the time of the accident and had pulled herself off me
My hair must have been  Almost in my mouth I said
Exactly
I have been  What
Licking it my dear
Its awfully good for hair you know imparts a glosslike and silky appearance
Besides since  Idiot
I climbed gingerly out of the car and then helped her into the bushes
Suffering from shock Alice
Im really devilish sorry
Not a bit
It wasnt your fault
Between you and me Hare I think you managed it wonderfully
Thank you Alice
Thats very sweet of you
I hope Pomfret isnt much hurt
The little brute
Only a wing I think
Look here if we walk into the village you can have some lunch you must want it at the inn while I get some help to get him out
Just at the foot of the hill we came upon The Old Drum its timbered walls showing white behind the red screen of its Virginia creeper
When I had escorted my lady into the little parlour I sought the kitchen
I could hardly believe my ears when the comfortable mistress of the house told me that at that very moment a toothsome duck was roasting and that it would and should be placed before us in a quarter of an hour
Without waiting to inquire whom we were about to deprive of their succulent dish I hastened with the good news to my companion
Splendid
she said
You dont mind waiting
I should have waited for you anyway
Now go and retrieve Pomfret youve just got time
To the two husbandmen I found in the bar the idea of earning twopence a minute for a quarter of an hour appealed so strongly that they did not wait to finish the ale I had ordered for them and the feats of strength they performed in persuading Pomfret to return to the path from which he had strayed made me ache all over
The result was that the car was in the yard before the duck had left the oven and I was able to have a wash at the pump before luncheon was served
Pomfret had come off very lightly on the whole
Except for the broken wing a fair complement of scratches and the total wreck of one of the lamps he seemed to have taken no hurt
So it happened that Alice and I lunched together
I think we were both glad of the food
When it was over I lighted her cigarette and drew her attention to the oleograph which pictured Gideons astonishment at the condition of what on examination proved to be a large fleece
Out of perspective in the background a youth staggered under a pile of firstfruits
No wayside inn parlour is complete without one such picture said I
As a rule we are misled about Moses
This however is of a later school
Besides this is really something out of the common
Why
Well thats not Gideon really but Garrick as Gideon
Very rare
And that with the firstfruits is Kean as Yes
As Ever I went on hurriedly Gideons great pal you know brother of Always
And Mrs Siddons  Who made her debut six years after Garricks farewellAnd youre all wrong about Kean
But dont let me stop you
Which is Nell Gwynne
Nelly
Ah no she isnt in the picture
But she stopped here once for lunch quite by chance and unattended save for a poor fool she had found in the forest
Hunting she had been and had lost her horse and he brought her on her way on a pillion
Be sure he rode with his chin on his shoulder all the time
She never said who she was but he knew her for some great lady for all his dullness
Ah Nell you she was very sweet to him let him see the stars in her eyes let him mark the blue cloud of her hair suffered him to sit by her side at their meal gave him of her fair company and and like them all he loved her
All the time too from the moment when he turned and saw her standing there by the fallen tree in the forest with her loose hair scrambling over her temples scrambling to see the stars in her eyes
The day passed and then another and then the weeks and months and presently the years very slowly
But always the fool saw her standing there in the sunshine with the dear faint smile on her lips and the bright memory of her eyes lighted his path when the way was dark and he might have stumbled always always
I stopped
She was looking away out of the latticed window up at the clear blue sky looking with the look that is blind and seeth nothing
I came round to the back of her chair and put my hands on her shoulders
We never finished our scene I said gently
No
No
You pushed me away
Did I
A pause
Then May I finish it now
I said
I expect she said slowly I expect you know that bit all right
I shall cut it on the night of the performance
She leaned right back in her chair and looked steadily up into my eyes
I bent over her
Youll do nothing of the sort she said firmly
She may be  A goddess
But she wont be you
No
she smiled
Never Alice
Promise me youll not cut it on the night
I groaned
But  I faltered
Promise
Oh all right
But I shall hate it Alice hate  A present for a good Hare she said softly and raised her lips to mine
On examination Pomfret proved to be practically unhurt and I was able to get some petrol in the village but naturally I didnt dare to drive him without seeing to the brakes
It was impossible for my companion to wait while I rectified the trouble but we managed to raise what had once been a dogcart and in that she left for Tendon Harrow
She left I say for she would not let me come with her
She was so firm
I implored her but it was no good
She simply would not be entreated and I had to content myself with putting her carefully in and watching her drive away in the care of a blushing halfboots halfostler who could not have been more than eighteen
I got home about six
Where on earth have you been
said Daphne as I entered the smokingroom
Ask Pomfret said I
Hes in disgrace
You havent hurt him
He nearly killed me
What happened Lost his temper just because the petrol ran out
Believe me a horrid exhibition
Absolutely let himself go
In other words the brakes failed and I had to run him into the bushes
One lamp and one wing broken otherwise unhurt
To adjusting brakes materials nil labour three hours at a drink an hour three pints ale
Oh rotten my dear rotten
I sank into a chair
Meanwhile weve had to entertain the Wilson crowd
I suppose you forgot they were coming
I was with you in spirit
In beer you mean said Berry
Look here I knew you when you were seven before you had put off the white mantle of innocence and assumed the cloak of depravity
It has been my unhappy lot to be frequently in your company ever since and speaking from a long and distasteful experience of you and your ways I am quite satisfied that if you did meet with some slight contretemps you made no wholehearted effort to rejoin us in time to degrade your intellect by discussing the sort of topics which appeal to that genus of hopeless wasters which the Wilsons adorn
Was it very bad
said I
Bad
said Jonah
Bad
When a woman with six male children leads off by telling you that she keeps a book in which she has faithfully recorded all the amusing sayings of her produce up to the age of seven its pretty bad isnt it
Not really
Fact said Berry
She quoted a lot of them
One of the more nutty was a contribution from Albert on seeing his father smoking for the first time
Mother is daddy on fire Now that really happened
We had about half an hour of the book
Jonah asked her why she didnt publish it and she nearly kissed him
It was terrible
To make things worse said Jonah they brought Baldwin and Arthur with them as specimens of what they could do in the child line
How awful
said I It was rather trying said Berry
But they were all right as soon as we turned them on to the typewriter
What
I gasped
Oh we had little or no trouble with them after that
Quiet as mice said Jonah
Do you know that machine cost me twentyfive pounds
I cried
The jamll wash off said Berry 
You dont know how easily jam comes off
Why Ive known  If I thought you really had turned them on to the typewriter I should never forgive you
You oughtnt to say a thing like that even in jest said Berry it isnt Christian
I tell you for your good
Seriously you didnt do such a wicked thing
Hullo where is it
Theyre going to bring it back on Wednesday
I said they couldnt have it more than a week
I glanced at Jill who was standing by the window
Her left eyelid flickered and I knew it was all right
Well I cant help it I said sinking back into my chair and lighting a cigarette
Poor old chap
said Daphne
I believe you thought we had done you down
Of course I didnt
Is it tomorrow youve got to go up to Town Jill
Yes Boy
Are you going up too
Must
Ill give you lunch at the Berkeley if you like dear
Jill came across and laid her cheek against mine
I always like Boy because hes grateful she said gently
Three days later our fellowmummers began to arrive
A deep melancholy had settled upon me
I cursed the play I cursed the players I cursed my part and most of all I cursed the day which had seen me cast for Buckingham
Whenever I picked up the book I saw my queen Alice standing there by the fallen tree or sitting looking up at me as I bent over her chair in the parlour of The Old Drum
And now her place was to be taken usurped by another a Miss Tanyon whom I hated terribly though I didnt know her and the very idea of whom was enough to kill any dramatic instinct I once seemed to possess
Whenever I remembered my promise to Alice I writhed
So odious are comparisons
When Daphne announced that the wretched woman was coming by the fivefourteen and that she should go with the car to meet her and added that I had better come too I refused pointblank
I dont know whats the matter with you said my sister
Dont you want to see the girl youll have to play the lovescene with
This about finished me and I laughed bitterly
No I said Im damned if I do
When Daphne pressed her point as only Daphne can I felt really too timid and bored with the whole affair to argue about it so I gave way
Accordingly at ten minutes past five I stood moodily on the platform by my sisters side
The train steamed in and the passengers began to alight
Daphne scanned them eagerly
I dont see her she said half to herself
We were standing halfway down the platform and I turned and looked listlessly towards the front of the train
That end of the platform was empty except for two people
One was a stoker who had stepped off the footplate
The other was Alice
She was in blue still a blue coat and skirt with a fox fur about her shoulders
A small blue felt hat was somewhat shading her eyes but I could see she was looking at me and smiling
I forgot all about Miss Tanyon she simply didnt matter now
Involuntarily  Why
theres the Queen
I cried and started towards her
Where
said Daphne
Here I flung over my shoulder
A fourwheeled truck of luggage propelled by a porter across my bows blocked my way for a moment and Daphne overtook me
So it is she said
But how did you know
CHAPTER XII THE ORDER OF THE BATH Berry blotted the letter with maddening precision
Then he picked it up tenderly and handed it to me
How will that do
Read it aloud said Daphne
I did so
Dear SirIn the interests of personal cleanliness we have not without considerable hesitation decided to install a fourth bathroom at our historic home White Ladies
This decision will necessitate the loss or conversion of one of the dressingrooms a fact which fills us with the gravest misgivings since there are only eleven in the whole mansion
At the same time thee conventions of a prudish age make it undesirable that a second bath should be installed in one of the rooms already existing for that purpose
We think the fourth room on your right as you leave the back stairs going south
This is locally known as the Green Room and takes its name not as you may imagine from the fact that the late Sir Henry Irving once slept there but from the hue of the rodents said there frequently to have been observed by the fourth Earl
Please execute the work with your customary diligence
We should like to pay on the hire system ie so much a month extending over a period of two years
The great strides recently made in the perilous art of aviation suggest to us that the windows should be of ground glass
Yours faithfully etc
PS
 lf your men drop the bath on the stairs the second footman will at once apply for a warrant for their arrest
Jill buried her face in the sofacushions and gave way to unrestrained merriment
Jonah laughed openly
I set my teeth and tried not to smile
For an instant the corners of Daphnes mouth twitched
Then Wretched ass she said
The truth is said her husband you dont know literature when you see it
Now that letter  I suppose I shall have to write to the man said I
There you are said Berry
Insults at every turn
I was about to say that I regarded that letter as one of the brightest jewels in an already crowded diadem
Give me the writingblock I said shortly producing my fountainpen
I turned to Daphne
What sort of a bath dyou want
Porcelainenamel they call it dont they
she replied vaguely subjecting a box of chocolates to a searching crossexamination
Berry rose to his feet and cleared his throat
Then he sang lustily  What of the bath
The bath was made of porcelain Of true ware of good ware The ware that wont come off A large cushion sailed into his face
As it fell to the ground Berry seized it and held it at arms length
Ha he said rapturously
A floral tribute
They recognize my talent
Not at all said Jonah
I only threw that because the dead cats havent come
Exactly said I
We all know you ought to be understudying at the Hoxton Empire but thats no reason why we should be subjected  Did you notice the remarkable compass of my voice
said Berry sinking into a chair
I did said I
I should box it if I were you brother
Bottle it if you prefer
Poor fool said my brotherinlaw
For the trumpet notes to which it has just been your privilege to listen there is a great future
In short my voice is futurist
The moment they hear it the few who have paid for their seats will realize what the boxoffice will say when they demand the return of their money
And those who have not paid
said I
Oh they will understand why they were given tickets
Suppose you write that letter said Daphne wearily
I bent over the writingblock
You know said Berry  I dont think this baths at all necessary
At this there was a great uproar
At length Besides said my sister we all decided that we must have another bath ages ago
The only question theres ever been was where to put it
Of course said I
If we dont where are we going to dip the sheep
Well I think its a shame to pull the old place about like this
If were so awfully dirty wed better find another house thats got four bathrooms already and sell White Ladies
Sell White Ladies
cried Jill
Berry nodded
Not only lock and stock but barrel too
Yes he added bitterly the old waterbutt must go
Look here said I
It occurs to me that this isnt a case for a letter
We ought to go and choose a bath properly
Thats rather an idea said Daphne
Simply sparkling said her husband
Personally Ive got something better to do than to burst down to South London and stagger round floor after floor staring at baths
You neednt worry said Daphne coolly
I wouldnt go with you for a hundred pounds
Berry turned to us others
Yet we love one another he said with a leer in his wifes direction
In reality I am the light of her eyes
The acetylene gas as it were of her existence
Well well
He rose and stretched himself
I wash my hands of the whole matter
Note the appropriate simile
Install what cistern you please
If approached properly I may consent to test the work when complete
Mind you spare no expense
We dont propose to said Daphne
Berry regarded her sorrowfully
I suppose he said I suppose you know what word will be found at the postmortem graven upon my heart
What
said Daphne stifling a yawn
Plunge
It was quite a good day to choose a bath
True it was winter
But then the sun was shining out of a clear blue sky there was a rare freshness in the London air and beneath me for I was crossing Westminster Bridge old Thames marched all aglitter
I watched his passage gratefully
It was that of a neverending band
Playing all the way too but silently
Yet the music was there
The pity was that one could not hear it
The pomp the swagger the swing of the Guards the shifting movement the bright array all these were unmistakable
The very lilt of the air made itself felt
Very cheery
Certainly the river was en fete
It had been arranged that the selection of an appropriate bath should be made by Daphne Jonah and me
When I came down to breakfast to find that Jonah had already left for Huntercombe I was more hurt than surprised
But when Daphne appeared during the marmalade clad in a new ridinghabit I made haste to empty my mouth
You cant ride there I said
The traffics too heavy
Besides the tramlines  You dont want me old chap said my sister stooping to lay her soft cheek against mine as she passed to her place
I drank some coffee with an injured air
Then This I said is low down
Not nice
I dont like it in you
It argues   the confidence we repose in your judgment said Daphne
Yes brother said Berry looking up from The Sportsman
The bathdressinggown has fallen upon your rounded shoulders
Ill though it becomes you I trust that  Enough said I
Alone I will select a bath
Doubtless you will all deplore my choice as bitterly as you will fight with one another for the privilege of using it
However
When I am dead you will regret  No we shant said my brotherinlaw
We shall just bury you under another name and try to keep the obituary notices out of the papers
I sat back in my chair and frowned
Be good enough to pass the rolls said I
Youve only had four said Berry pushing them across
Mind you get a good lunch at Lambeth
Im told they do you very well at The Three Balls
When Im choosing a bath said I  I always lunch at The Rising Spray
And now here I was afoot upon Westminster Bridge bound for the warehouse of the firm we proposed to honour with our patronage
I passed on into the roar of the crowded streets and a quarter of an hour later I reached the place I sought
Almost immediately the officeboy took me for a commercial traveller and refused pointblank to announce my arrival
I told him that I had an appointment
Yes he said pleasantly
They all as
Friend said I I see that you are bent on gaining the feathered fowl
In other words if Im kept waiting much longer youll get the bird
I dont think he replied somewhat uneasily
That said I is what I complain of
I seated myself on a table and lighted a cigarette
Then I wonder how hell like his new place I said apostrophizing the skylight
A pause
Then Of corse the guvnor might be in said the youth
Yer never knows
Speak for yourself said I
At the same time you appear to be doing what you conceive to be your duty
And for those who do their duty there is always a shilling in the lefthand trouserpocket  But the boy was halfway upstairs
I had proved my identity
Five minutes later one of the partners was conducting me in the direction of the baths
Now he had twice begged me to be careful not to hit my head for he led me through divers dark lowpitched corridors
Especially divers
I remembered his warning about a fifth of a second too late
When we at length emerged again into the broad light of day I contemplated my new bowler in some annoyance
It was bashed in properly
A large dent in shape somewhat resembling the Empire of India leered at me its edges generously defined with whitewash
Very trying
My good host was greatly concerned and begged to be allowed to take the damaged headgear away and have it brushed
After a little I consented promising to walk round and look at the baths while he was gone
The next moment he had disappeared
I laid my stick and gloves on a glasstopped table and looked about me
Never before had I seen so many baths gathered together
Large and small deep and shallow normal and abnormal they stood orderly in long lines
The more elaborate ones fitted with screens and showers douches etc stood a little apart upon a baizecovered dais bright with their glistening pipes and rows of taps
And in an alcove all glorious electric light burning above its goldlacquered fittings reposed the bath of baths a veritable monarch with his attendant basin marbletopped table gilded towelrails etc etc
Attracted by the aristocracy upon the dais I was proceeding to stroll humbly in their direction when I heard the sound of footsteps
The next moment a girl stepped lightly between great sliding iron doors which led obviously from an adjoining chamber on the same floor
Very smart she was in a black cloth coat with ermine collar and cuffs
On her head was a trim black hat from which a fine brooch was blazing
Save that she was fair and that her feet flashed as she walked I could see little more
For a moment the newcomer hesitated looking about her
Then she came towards me
Oh she said
I want to choose a bath
For an instant I looked at her
Then I remembered that I was hatless stickless gloveless
I bowed
Certainly madam
What sort of bath do you require
She was looking at me now narrowly rather
Quickly she swung round and glanced about the great hall
Then she spoke somewhat uneasily
Er if you would show me some baths with showers and things please  With pleasure madam
Will you come this way
I preceded her in the direction of the great ones
Now this I said laying my hand familiarly on the smooth edge of one of the grandes dames this is The Duchess
Very popular madam
She may not exactly figure in Society but I can assure you that every morning half Society figures in her
I glanced at the girl to see an amused smile struggling with grave suspicion in her eyes
I went on hurriedly
Weve been selling a great number lately
Have you
she said slowly
Yes indeed madam
Only this morning we received an order for fourteen from Madagascar
I turned to another patrician
Here again is a firstclass bath
The Nobleman
A great feature is the glass screen
The enamel too is of the very best quality
Nickelplated fittings stream line body detachable whee er that is the waste also is constructed on a most ingenious principle we call it the WantNot pattern
Ah she said quietly 
And whats the price of this er paragon
I glanced at the ticket knitting my brows
Well its listed at AWK but to you madam the price is  I looked at her smiling
Yes
she said with her grey eyes on mine
Her eyebrows were raised a little and the soft lips had taken on the curve that tells of laughter hardly controlled
Another look like that said I and Ill give it you and pay the carriage
She broke into a long ripple of delight
Then she took her seat upon The Noblemans  broad edge and regarded me mischievously
I think you ought to apologize she said severely
Who took me for a salesman
said I
I never did that
You see Ive been looking at basins over there she pointed in the direction of the iron doors and they said if I came through here I should find one of the partners
Besides I wasnt a bit sure when I first spoke but as you had no hat And then you led me on
Still I beg your pardon
Not at all
The partners a very nice chap
And the mischief is reparable
I mean  Where is the partner
At the present moment I believe hes engaged in trying to efface the Indian Empire
Bit of a Socialist you know I added
May I smoke
What dyou mean
Doesnt she know the word
Smoke my dear
Draw into and expel from the mouth the fumes of burning tobac  Idiot
About the Little Englander
I explained
And now I said with a wave of my cigarette behold me once more at your service
The gentle art of bathing madam is of considerable antiquity
In classical times the bath played a very prominent part in the everyday existence of the cleanly nut
Then came a dead period in the history of personal irrigation
Recently however the bathrate has once more gone up immersion is again in vogue and today in the best circles scarcely a month passes without And these she swept the nobility with a glance are the upper ten
Precisely
You can tell that from their polish
Rather exclusive arent they
Collectively yes madam
Individually they will receive you with open arms
Only last night an order arrived from I know
Madagascar
Youre no good as a salesman
I drew myself up
From Honolulu for twentytwo Godsends
I said icily
Madagascars request was for Duchesses
That over there is a Wallsend I mean Godsend
And I suppose youve supplied Cochin China for years One of our oldest clients said I
You know said she when I look round I feel as if I had never seen a bath before
I know
I felt just like that at first
And yet I have I added thoughtfully they had one at a hotel I stayed at last Easter
At Biarritz that was
I wish youd be serious she said laughing
Then you might be of some use
I dont think youre at all kind said I leaning against the screen of The Duchess with a dejected air
Excuse me she said  but is that the Slinker Slouch Ive heard of
Your attitude I mean
No I said shortly
Its the Leicester Lounge
But to return to your unkindness
I want a bath just as much as you do
She recoiled
You know what I mean
Im a customer like you
Were both in the same baboat
And I have been doing my best to indicate the merits oferof  The idle rich she said smiling
Yes but you see you shouldnt have
When you saw me coming you ought to have  Dodged behind a pillar picked up my stick and gloves and kept about ten bathlengths away until the partner reappeared
No doubt
But then you shouldnt have looked so priceless or worn your sense of humour on your sleeve
You shouldnt have had a small straight nose or a mouth like a red flower
You shouldnt have walked like a thoroughbred or carried your clothes as if they were worth wearing
You shouldnt have had eyes I could see to read by if the light failed
Finished
No
But listen
I think I hear the partner coming the genuine article this time
There was no sound
Anyway I went on hell be back in a moment and so as Im afraid I didnt consider you just now Ill try and make up for it
Goodbye
But what about your bath
Have you seen one you like
Yes said I
I have
One
Not a bath though
But I can easily come another day
I turned resolutely away
I say said the girl quietly
I swung round and looked at her
She still sat upon the edge of The Nobleman her little gloved hands gripping the rim on either side of her
Her face was raised a little but she was looking down
One slight leg thrust out from under the blue frock its dainty instep gleaming under the silk stocking
The ankle above it very slender the bucked shoe literally beaming with pride
Yes
I said
I havent seen a bath I like either she said simply
At this moment the partner came bustling back full of apologies
Stifling a desire to strangle him I congratulated the good man upon the condition of my hat and turned to the girl
Then as we both want to see some baths perhaps we might look at some together
I said
I think so
If you please madam said the partner
He turned to The Duchess
Now this is a firstclass bath
One of our very latest models
Only this morning we received an order from Ceylon  Fortunately we were both a little behind him
No one can say that we did not weigh the merits of the various baths carefully
We passed from one to another asking questions receiving information examining criticizing discussing for over an hour
Four times to our great joy the excellent partner actually climbed into a bath the more satisfactorily to emphasize its advantages
As he sat there faithfully reproducing the various movements of the arms universally I suppose employed in the process of ablution the living picture which he presented put an obviously severe strain upon the gravity of my companion
And when in response to a daringly ingenuous thirst for intelligence on my part he proceeded to demonstrate the comparative ease with which a lefthanded bather suffering from sciatica could manipulate the taps from the wrong end of the bath the girl hurriedly sought the shelter of a convenient pillar to hide her open merriment
We had a great time
Finally we each gave an order for a Pompadour which seemed on the whole to merit the palm
It was certainly the last word in the bath line
While she was giving her name and the address of the home which her new bath was to adorn I strolled a little apart thinking
When she had finished the partner turned to me
I think I have the address sir
The same as before
Thats right said I
Im going down there on Tuesday
Could you send a man down that day to see the room and take the measurements
Id like to be there myself
Certainly sir
Very well
Hed better come by the ninethirty whichll get him down in two hours
Ill send to meet him
Im going down by car myself
Thank you sir
He turned to the girl inquiringly
Perhaps Tuesday would suit you too madam
I dont think you mentioned any particular day and as its the same station for both houses madam  He broke off
She and I were staring at one another
Then How awfully strange we said in unison
The partner being there there was no more to be said
Tuesday will do very well she said turning to him
Together he conducted us to the street
Then might he send for a taxi
There was a rank
The idea of sending for two taxis never seemed to enter his head
A good fellow that partner
But no thank you my lady would walk
Would pick up a cab presently
May I have the pleasure of seeing you to a taxi
said I naturally enough
Thank you very much
We bade the partner goodbye and turned in the direction of Westminster
Youre sure its not taking you out of your way
said my companion with an innocent look
Out of my way said I
Dyou think I live at Tooting
She broke into a little laugh
I went on And if I did
If I lived at Hither Green and was just going to miss the last tram dont you think Id er miss it
Youre very kind she said quietly
Not at all said I with a glance downward
The small bright shoe is on the other exquisite er foot
Its very good of you to let me walk with you especially in view of my recent scandalous behaviour all among the baths
Which reminds me you were awful
I thought I should die when you asked that poor man  A wholesome thirst for knowledge my dear
Talking of which dyou know its getting on for halfpast one
Is it really
It is indeed
Time tears away sometimes doesnt he
Sometimes
You are sweet said I
However
About Time
Hes a mocker of men you know very contrary
When he can serve not he
When he cannot he is willing enough
Beg him to hasten hell cock his hat and stroll with an air of leisure that makes us dance
Cry him to tarry he is already gone the wind panting behind him
Bid him return he is at once all sympathy grave sympathy He may not
Otherwise he would have been so pleased
Sorry
Rather like my brotherinlaw
Youll meet him at White Ladies
Is that where the baths going
Certainly
We shall be there in the spring
Will you come to our bathwarming
Perhaps
We came to the bridge and the sunshine and the marching river and beyond these to Bridge Street and the green square
At the corner she hesitated
I think Id better say goodbye now
Im going to see a fellow said I
I wish youd come with me
A quick look of surprise
Then Do I know him
I think so
Hes one of the Times
Lunch Time hes called brother of Half Time
Both sons of the old man
She smiled
Ah she said
Ive an appointment with him too
Only mines at home
I must be going
Im keeping him waiting now
She held out her hand
I looked at it
Youve made a mistake I said
I know for a fact hes going to be at the Carlton
No good
I know the family
The father taught them all the trick of being able to be in more than one place at the same time
All of them
Yes
My dear youre wrong
Youve forgotten Mean
Hes got a place at Greenwich you know and never leaves it
Well I wont bother her for shes been awfully sweet
Shall I call her a taxi
She nodded
I dont think we ought to stand here any longer the atmospheric pressure of the Labour party is already affecting my breathing
Besides any moment I might be mistaken for a Cabinet Minister
I know a salesmans pretty bad but I must draw the line somewhere
With that I hailed a taxi
As it was coming to the kerb Youre a dear CB I said
But I would have loved to have given you lunch
She smiled gently
Would you
You know I would lass
Well I shall look forward to you and the spring
The cab drew up and I opened the door
She stepped in
Where shall I tell him to go
For a moment she hesitated
Then she spoke slowly Was it the Carlton you said
An hour later I stood once more at a taxis door
Our luncheon was over and I was saying farewell
Youve been awfully kind said the girl
Goodbye said I
I shall look forward to you at White Ladies
And to the spring
I bowed
My dear the terms are synonymous
The smile deepened
If this wasnt the Haymarket said I She was gone her eyes full of laughter
I turned to see Berry three paces away
Helping the porter
he said pleasantly
I wondered where you got that two shillings from last week
But oughtnt you to be in uniform
I should have thought Nathans  Ive chosen a bath I said seeking to divert his thoughts
After all he might not have seen
Fine big place
Stacks of baths you know
By the way the officeboy took me for a commercial traveller I added
Naturally
And the girl
Who did she take you for
I drew myself up
Shes a CB
too I said loftily
What more natural than that we should  CB
said Berry scornfully
Now if you had said KG  I cut him short
You neednt tell the others I said
A fat grin stole into his face
He sighed
The call of duty brother however distasteful  Look here said I
You know those new cigars at the club
Yes he said eagerly
The halfacrown ones
Theyre not new I said uneasily
Never mind he said airily taking my arm
I feel sure a halfacrown cigar would affect my memory
And a dry Martini would probably finish it
I groaned
This is sheer blackmail said I
Take it or leave it said Berry with the air of one who has the whiphand
All right I said wearily
I should think so my son
And cheap at the price too
On the whole I think it was
CHAPTER XIII A LUCID INTERVAL Ausgang verboten
said the guard
Yes said Berry
You look it
Hush
said Daphne
Hush yourself replied her husband
The man is ill
I would minister to him
We got him away somehbw and bore him towards a taxi
Before we could stop him he had congratulated the driver in excellent French on his recovery from the accident which had so painfully disfigured him and had asked for the name and address of the man who had designed the body of his cab
This was too much for Daphne and she and Jonah called another taxi and said they would see us at the hotel
Satisfied that the conductor of the hotel omnibus was collecting our luggage I followed Jill and Berry into the cab and we drove out of the station
When we reached the hotel Berry told the porter that he need not uncover as he was travelling incognito and asked if Mrs Pleydel had arrived
Receiving a negative answer he gave the man five marks and asked him to be very careful as to the way he lifted the cats basket out of his wifes cab
Then he suffered himself to be conducted to the sittingroom which I had engaged on the first floor
Five minutes later Daphne burst into the room
What on earths the matter with the people here
she demanded
Half the staff are feeling all over the inside of our cab and the porter keeps asking me if Im sure the cat was put in at the station
Is this some of your doing
Possibly some idle banter I knew it said Daphne
If this is how you begin we shant get out of Munich alive
Why we had chosen Munich is not very easy to tell
Of course we ought to have gone to Biarritz and taken the car but they wouldnt have that
Everybody had wanted to go to a different place
Berrys choice was Minsk because he said he wanted to rub up his Hebrew
Such a suggestion is characteristic of Berry
Then Munich was mentioned and as no one had seemed very keen no one had taken the trouble to be very rude about it
Consequently Munich won
A day or two after our arrival one of Wagners triumphs was to be given at the Opera House and amid a scene of great excitement Berry secured four tickets
I say four because I mean four
I have never appreciated opera and was all along reluctant to go
But when I found that the show began at halfpast four I put my foot down and reminded the others of the Daylight Saving Bill
With gusto they retorted that I had been to more matinees than they cared to remember
I replied that for a theatre to begin at halfpast four was out of all order and convenience and that as an Englishman and a member of a conservative club I was not prepared to subscribe to such an unnatural arrangement
Brother said Berry I weep for you
Not now but in the privacy of my chamber I often weep great tears
Friend said I your plain but honest face belies your words
You dont want to see the opera any more than I do and now youre jealous because tomorrow I shall sit down to dinner comfortably while you are trying to remember which of the sandwiches have mustard and praying that the lights wont go up till your mouths empty
To the consternation of the assistants in the library Berry covered his face with his hands
He thinks it decent to revile me he said weakly
Where is my wife my helpmeet
But Daphne had already retired
As I left the shop an American lady approached Berry and told him the way to the English chemist
At five the next day it began to rain
I was in Maximilian Street at the time admiring the proportions of the thoroughfare and ready for anything
The rain suggested to me that I should take a taxi to the Rumpelmayers of Munich
A closed one was crawling by the kerb opposite to me on the far side of the road
I put up my stick and it slowed down
I crossed to it spoke to the driver who scowled at me seemingly because I approached him from the road and not from the pavement Munich is very particular and got in
As I sat back in the dark corner the opposite door opened
The light of the offside lamps showed me two big brown eyes a dear puzzled face half wondering half wanting to laugh and a row of white teeth catching a red upper lip that trembled in a smile
The next moment their owner stepped quickly in the driver let in his clutch with a jerk and my unwitting companion was projected heavily into the corner not mine she had been about to occupy
She swore gently
Thats right said I
She jumped properly
Good Heavens
Im so sorry but Im all right said I I assure you
Young man of gentlemanly appearance
Harrow and Oxford terms moderate bathroom and domestic offices possession early in June  Get out of my cab at once
 will send photograph if required
Whose cab
Well I engaged it
So did I
When
Just now
How awfully funny
Isnt it
Im so glad
Im English too you know
I can prove that by my German
And  But you dont want to go where I do
But I do
Dont be silly
You know what I mean
At this moment the off hind wheel of a big limousine which was passing us caught our near front wheel
The steeringwheel was knocked out of the cabmans hands and we landed up against a lamppost with a crash that flung my companion and myself on to the floor of the taxi
The girl cried out put her small hand into my mouth and sat up
I spoke into her glove
Are you hurt
No but I think Im going to cry
Dont my dear
Its all right
All the same its an outrage and a casus belli
Where does the British Ambassador live
Here the door was opened
The girl released me to adjust her hat and I rolled on to the step and sat looking at a tall footman who raised his hat and said something in German
The next minute a lady appeared
She began to speak in German then Oh you are English she said
I rose and bowed stiffly
Yes madame I have that honour
I am so very sorry
I do hope you are not hurt
I am only shaken thank you
She looked into the cab
My dear she purred I am so terribly sorry
I hope you were not hurt either
I cannot say  No Im all right thank you
Ill get out
Then she fainted
I caught her and carried her to the limousine
When I had set her on the deep seat I turned to the lady
I do not know where she lives I said
We have only met casually
A physician
she queried
Had she better  I dont think it is a case for a doctor
She has only fainted
Perhaps you  I will attend to her and when we get to the Opera House my maid  She turned to the footman and seemed to tell him to stay behind and see to the cabman and the police who had come up
Then she stepped into the car and a moment later we were slipping silently up the street
By the lights in the car I could see that our friend was a handsome woman of perhaps thirtyeight
She was almost entirely enveloped in a magnificent sable coat her head was bare
The great thing about her was her exquisite voice
While her fingers were busy about the girls hat and throat the latter opened her eyes
Then she sat up and put her hand to her head
No lean back my dear said our hostess
I will spray you
She sprayed her with eaudeCologne
Thats lovely said the girl with closed eyes
Thank you so much
The other stopped for a moment to take off the jaunty little hat and lightly push the dark hair away from the white temples
The girl thanked her with a smile
Then she started up again
Oh but where is  She saw me and stopped colouring
He is here in the car
She closed her eyes once more and the colour had faded from her cheeks before she spoke again
Where are we going
she said
To the Opera House dear
You see I am singing there
I would take you home but I am late now
My maid she will make you comfortable
I have nice rooms at the theatre quite an apartment
She turned to me
And you will come too please
There is plenty of room
Besides she is in your charge
Of course said I
Thank you very much
As she had said a regular little suite had been allotted to our hostess at the Opera House
As well as the dressingroom there was a bathroom and a large sittingroom with flowers everywhere and beautifully furnished
Here I waited wondering a little
The others had passed into the dressingroom
Presently Yvonne the French maid entered the room
Mademoiselle recovers monsieur she said with a smile
Also she dines here and monsieur with her
It is all arranged
If you please said I
It seemed about the best thing to say
Very swiftly she laid the table for two a cold chicken some salad rolls and a bottle of champagne
Thank you
It is not much said Yvonne apologetically
Now at Madames house  Yvonne
came from the dressingroom
Pardon monsieur
Yvonne disappeared
Five minutes later a telephone bell rang
Then the dressingroom door opened and Madame came forth robed and the girl with her looking as right as rain
That was my call said our hostess
I go to sing now
By the time you have finished I shall be back and then later if you would like to sit in a box for a little while it will be quiet for you both
Come Yvonne
She swept out of the room
Yvonne closed the door behind her
I like her said I
Shes a dear said my companion
I like you too said I
She swept me a curtsey
It was silly of me to faint
You did it so sweetly
Thisll teach you not to take other peoples taxis
On the contrary Would you like to give me some chicken
Ishould like  Yes
She looked at me straight in the eyes
I walked to the table and took up the knife and fork
Yes
I looked at her smiling gloriously now
Oh Id like Berry to see us now
She came across and laid a hand on my shoulder
I like you too she said
We had a great meal
She didnt want to drink any champagne but I persuaded her to take a little
And whos Berry
she said pushing back her chair
A mistake said I
A great mistake
Thats what he is
She laughed
Who made him
My sister
She married him you see
Of course I shall get confused in a moment
Well things have got a move on in the last hour and a quarter havent they
I mean to say at five oclock you found a stranger in your taxi
Five minutes later you were smashed up
Now youre in a prima donnas room at the Opera House eating a cold collation
Collation is good isnt it
Awfully
Where did you hear it
I frowned
I came out top in dictation last term
Indeed
Genius and madness do go together dont they
You are mad arent you
Raving my dear
Ive been certified for two years come Ember
Out on licence under the new Cock and Bull Bill
You know And your petitioners will ever Pray  I suppose you do have lucid intervals
Only on third Tuesdays
Such as today
By Jove so it is
I thought one was about due
Now I come to think of it I nearly had one just now
When
When you asked me what I should like
In silence she traced a pattern upon the white cloth with a small pink finger
I watched it and wondered whether her eyes were smiling
I couldnt see them but her mouth looked as if it wanted to
Then I think youd better tell me when the intervals coming she said quietly
One usually goes out  Youre thinking of Plays said I
Between Acts II and III ten minutes and the safety curtain
But with Life and fools its different
You dont go out in these intervals
No
No I said
On the contrary its where you come in
She looked up smiling at that
I addressed her eyes
You see in Life its just the intervals that count those rare hours when though the bands not playing theres music in the air though the worlds standing still and no ones looking on theres most afoot though the  Here the door opened and Madame came in Yvonne at her heels
It is the interval she explained
Thank you
Oh but she was in fine fettle was Madame
My voice is good tonight
It is you two that have helped me
You are so young and goodly
And I have a box the Royal box they are not using it you see if you would like to hear the rest of the opera
Yes
But you must come back and say Good night to me aiterwards
Our murmured thanks she would have none of
Supper and a box was little enough
Had she not nearly killed us both an hour ago
But now I shall sing to you and you will forgive me
I am in voice tonight
Is it not so Yvonne
But Madame
The ecstasy of Yvonne was almost pathetic
The ceremony with which we were installed in the Royal box was worthy of the Regent himself
But then Madame was a very great lady
The lights in the house did not go down for a minute and I peered over the rim of the balcony to see if I could locate Berry and Co
Suddenly I saw Jill and Berry next to her
He was staring straight at the Royal box and his face was a study
He must have seen me come in
Then the lights died and the curtain went up
The singing of Madame I cannot describe
It was not of this world
And we knew her
We were her friends
She was our hostess
To the house she was the great artiste a name to whisper a figurehead to bow before
For us we were listening to the song of a friend
As she had promised she sang to us
There was no mistaking it
And the great charm of her welled out in that wonderful voice
All the spirit of melody danced in her notes
When she was singing there seemed to be none but us in the theatre and soon no theatre only us in the world
We two only stepped by her side walked with her understood
Actually the girl and I sat spellbound smiling down as she smiled up from the stage
We knew afterwards that we had been sitting handinhand as children do
At the end of it all the house rose at her
Never was there such a scene
We rose too and stood smiling
Somehow we did not applaud
She just smiled back
Shall we go
said I
Yes
As I turned to the door I caught sight of four faces looking earnestly up from the stalls
I bowed gravely
An attendant was waiting in the corridor and we were escorted through the iron door the way we had come
Madame sat in a deep armchair in the sittingroom her hair all about her shoulders
She looked tired
Virtue had gone out of her
Ah my dears she said
My companion kneeled by her side and put her arms round her neck
Then she spoke and kissed her
I do not know what she said
The other held her very close for a moment then looked at me and smiled
I raised her hand to my lips
I cannot say anything Madame
It is all said
We have spoken together for the last halfhour
Is it not so
It is so Madame
After a little my companion said we must be going
He will see me to my hotel she said
I do not like letting you go said our hostess but I take long to dress
My car shall carry you home and return for me
Yvonne see to that
Yes there will be plenty of time
Besides you have driven enough in taxis for today
What have you lost my dear
The girl was looking about her
I think I must have left it in the box my chain bag
How silly
My dear I leave everything everywhere I will get it said I Yvonne had gone for the car
Besides I wanted to go
Oh thank you
Its quite a small gold  I know it said I smiling
Can you find your way
said Madame
The house will be almost in darkness
Oh yes Madame
A moment later I was in the corridor beyond the iron door
It was quite dark but twenty paces away a faint suggestion of light showed where the door of the Royal box stood open
When I reached it I saw that a solitary lamp was burning on the far side of the stalls
After glancing at it the darkness of the box seemed more impenetrable
I felt for the little gold bag on the balcony on the chair on the floor
It was nowhere
I stood up and peered into the great dim auditorium wondering whether I dared strike a match
Fearing that there might be a fireman somewhere in the darkness I abandoned the idea
The sudden flash might be seen and then people would come running and there would have to be explanations
I went down on my hands and knees and felt round her chair and then mine and then all over the box
Just as I got up my right hand encountered something hard and shiny
Clearly it wasnt what I was looking for but out of curiosity I stooped to feel it again
I groped in vain for a moment then I put my hand full on the buckle of a patentleather shoe
As my fingers closed about a warm ankle Pardon monsieur
came a quick whisper
I let go
Is that you Yvonne
Si monsieur
I never heard you come in
I have come this moment and did not see monsieur in the dark
Madame has sent me
Monsieur cannot find that little bag
No
Do you think I might strike a match
Ah no monsieur not in the Opera House They are so particular
I see at least I dont and thats the trouble
However  I felt over the balcony again
No good
Where did mademoiselle sit monsieur
Where are you
I groped in the direction of the whisper and found an arm
In that chair there I said guiding her to it
Here monsieur
Yes thats right
I heard her hands groping about the chair and turned to try the floor on the other side again
I have it monsieur
Well said I I could have sworn Id felt everywhere round that chair
She chinked the bag by way of answer
Anyway weve got it said I 
Come on
And I made for the door
Then I stopped to take one more look at the great house
As I did so a woman appeared on the far side of the stalls
She paused for a second to glance at herself in a mirror immediately under the solitary electric light
I recognized Yvonne
Then she passed on
Neither of us spoke for a moment
Then Why did you say you were Yvonne
said I
Yvonne is my name too
Were you afraid I might have a lucid interval
Perhaps
Your fears are realized
I have Im having one now
How awful
Isnt it
And now weve found your bag would you mind if I looked for something else
Something of yours or mine
Something of yours
Can I help you
she said slowly
Materially
With a little half laugh half sob a warm arm slid round my neck
Here they are
she whispered
Madame would not let us go till Yvonne had returned from the managers office with the offer of a box for Thursday
So it is not Goodbye and you will come and see me again
I sing then for the last time in Munich
I fear you cannot have your own box though
The Regent is coming that night
It is too bad
We laughed and bade her farewell
As the car slowed down at my companions hotel the footman slid off the front seat and opened the door
I got up and out of the car
As I turned I saw the girl pick up her gloves and leave the precious bag on the seat
My dear your bag  But as she got out the bag left the seat with her
By the lights in the car I saw that it was attached to a chain about her neck and the chain lay beneath her dress
I handed her out thoughtfully
Till Thursday then she said
Till tomorrow morning said I
She laughed
I think there ought to be an interval
Isnt that just what Im saying
What about a luncheon interval tomorrow
Well it mustnt be a lucid one All right
Ill bring Jonah and Daphne
Maynt I see the mistake
If I can find him
Goodbye Goodbye
I say  She turned one small foot on the steps
I love your feet I said
Anything else
Yes
Do you always unfasten that chain and take off the bag when you go to the theatre
She looked down at the little foot in its shining shoe
Then Only on third Tuesdays she said
When I reached my hotel I passed quickly upstairs to the sittingroom
Here he is said Daphne Come along darling and have some supper and tell us all about it
Supper
said Berry
Woman you forget yourself
You are no longer on the joywheel
My lord has dined
As a matter of fact I have said I
Madame gave me some dinner at the Opera House
Of course said Berry
What did I say
We grovelling worms can gnaw our sandwiches the while he cracks bottles of champagne was it
I nodded
Berry rose to his feet and in a voice broken with emotion called such shades of his ancestors as are on night duty to witness
Hencefifth he said I intend to lead a wicked life BlackpoolConservative no change said Jonah
Berry ignored the interruption
Virtue may have its own cakes and ale
I dare say it has
What of it
I never see any of them
Vice is more generous
Its patrons actually wallow in champagne
For me the most beastly sandwiches I ever ate and an expensive stall
For him dinner with the prima donna and the Royal box
By the way who did the girl mistake you for
One of the attendants or the business manager
Who was she
said Jill
I dont know
Rot
said Jonah
Its the truth
She looked rather a dear said Daphne
She is
Youll meet her tomorrow
And Berry she wants to meet Berry
She said so
There you are said my brotherinlaw
Is my tie straight
I lighted a cigarette to conceal a smile
CHAPTER XIV A PRIVATE VIEW When I had adjusted the cushions I sank into the chair and sighed
Whats that for
said Daphne Sin said I
Whose
That of him who packed for me at the Blahs this morning
A sin of omission rather than commission though he did put my spongebag into my collarcase I added musingly
Theyre both round you see
Still I pass that by
But what do you really complain of
said Jill
Hes left my dressinggown out
I expect he thought it was a loose cover said Jonah
Itll be sent on all right said Daphne Thats nothing
What about my fan
Youre not a bit sorry for me about that
I have already been sorry about it
I was sorry for you on Friday just by the sideboard
I remember it perfectly
All the same if you will waste Berrys substance at places of entertainment in the West End and then fling a priceless heirloom down in the hall of the theatre you mustnt be surprised if some flatfooted seeker after pleasure treads on it
He was a very nice man and his feet werent a bit flat
I believe you did it on purpose to get into conversation with him
Wheres Berry
At that moment the gentleman in question walked across the lawn towards us
Thank Heaven
he said when he saw me
Im so glad youre back
Ive run out of your cigarettes
I handed him my case in silence
Its curious he said how used one can get to inferior tobacco
Tea appeared in serial form
After depositing the threestoried cake dish holder or whatever the thing is called with a tobecompleted air the footman disappeared to return a moment later with the teapot and hot water
As he turned to go Bring me the tray thats on the billiardtable said Berry
Carry it carefully
Yes sir
Without moving we all observed one another the eyes looking sideways
You see the tray bore a jigsaw
When I had left on the previous Saturday for a weekend visit we had done the top righthand corner and half what looked as if it must be the left side
Most of this we had done on Friday evening but artificial light is inclined to militate against the labourer and at eleven oclock Berry had sworn twice shown us which pieces were missing and related the true history of poor Agatha Glynde who spent more than a fortnight over David Copperfield before she found out that the pieces had been mixed up with those of Constables Hay Wain
This upset us so much that Jonah said he should try and get a question asked in the House about it and we decided to send the thing back the next day and demand the return of the money
On the way up to bed Daphne had asked me if I thought we could get damages or compensation or something and I had replied that if we could prove malice they had undoubtedly brought themselves within the pale of the criminal law
The next morning Jill had done nearly two more square inches before breakfast and I missed the midday train to town
Hullo you have got on
I said as the man set the tray and its precious burden gingerly on the grass in our midst
Aha my friend said Berry I thought youd sit up
Yes sir the tract already developed represents no less an area than thirtysix square inches coldly calculated by me this afternoon during that fair hour which succeeds the sleep of repletion and the just but the vast possibilities which lie hidden beneath the surface of the undeveloped expanse of picture are almost frightening
A land rich in minerals teeming with virgin soil a very Canaan of today
Does it not call you brother
It does said I
I wish it didnt because its wicked waste of time but it does
I kneeled down that I might the better appreciate their industry
The jigsaw was called A Young Diana and was alleged to be a reproduction of the picture of that name which had appeared in the Academy the year before
I hardly remembered it
I gazed admiringly at the two clouds drifting alone at the top righthand corner the solitary hoof planted upon a slice of green sward the ragged suggestion of forest land in the distance and a ladder of enormous length which appeared to possess something of that spirit of independence which distinguished Mahomets coffin
In other words it was selfsupporting
After a careful scrutiny I rose to my feet took a pace or two backwards and put my head on one side
Then I like it I said
I like it
Some people might say it looked a little crude or unfinished but to my mind that but preserves as it were the spirit of barbarism which the title suggests
Suggestion as opposed to realization said Berry  is the rule by which we work
To the jaded appet imagination the hoof suggests a horse
It is up to you to imagine the horse
We have as it were with an effort set in motion the long unused machinery of your brain
It is for you brother to carry on the good work
Please pass out quietly
There will be collection plates at both doors
Youre not to touch it yet said Daphne 
I want to talk about abroad first
If were really going we must settle things
Of course were going said Berry
I ordered a yachting cap yesterday
Whats that for
said Jill
Well were not going to fly across the Channel are we
Besides that supposing we go to Lucerne part of the time
What about taking the car
said Daphne
Its expensive said Berry moodily but I dont see how else we can satisfactorily sustain the flow of bloated plutocracy which at present oozes from us
We all agreed that the car must come
Then arose the burning question of where to go
In a rash moment Jill murmured something about Montenegro
Montenegro
said Berry with a carelessness that should have put her on her guard
Yes said Jill
I heard someone talking about it when I was dining with the Bedells
It sounded priceless
I had a sort of idea it was quite small and had a prince but its really quite big and its got a king over it and they all wear the old picturesque dress and the scenerys gorgeous
And if it was wet we could go to the the  Kursaal said Berry
No not Kursaal
Its like that though
Casino
Thats it Casino
And then we could go on to Nice and Cannes and  Youre going too fast arent you
Servia comes before Cannes doesnt it
Well Servia too
All right said Berry
I was going to suggest that we joined the Danube at Limoges went up as far as Milan where the falls are and then struck off to Toledo taking Warsaw on the way but  Thatd be rather a long way round wouldnt it
said Jill all seriousness in her grey eyes
Ah I mean the Spanish Toledo not the one in the States
Oh I see  She checked herself suddenly and looked round
Hes laughing at me she said
What have I said wrong
If anyone asked me where we should be without our Jill said Berry I couldnt tell them
When we began to discuss the tour in good earnest the argument proper began
I had suggested that we should make for Frankfort to start with and Daphne and Jonah rather favoured Germany
Berry however wanted to go to Austria
It was after a casual enough remark of Jonahs that the roads in Germany were very good that Berry really got going
The roads good
he said
That settles it say no more
The survey which is after all the object of our holiday sic will be able to be made with success
If we start at once we shall be able to get the book published by Christmas Road Surfaces in Germany by a Hog
The old German towns are fascinating said Daphne
Nothing like them said Berry
I can smell some of them now
Can you not hear the cheerful din of the iron tires upon the cobbled streets
Can you not see the grateful smile spreading over the beersodden features of the cathedral verger as he pockets the money we pay for the privilege of following an objectionable rabble round an edifice which we shall remember more for the biting chill of its atmosphere than anything else
And then the musty quiet of the museums and the miles we shall cover in the picture galleries halting now and then to do a brief gloat in front of one of Van Stunks masterpieces My heart leaps up when I behold a Van Stunk on the wall
Wordsworth knew his Englishman didnt he
Oh well if youre so dead against it  Against it dear
How can I be against it
Why we may even be arrested as spies
There he looked round triumphantly who shall say that the age of romance is dead
Let us go forth and languish in a German gaol
Think of the notices we shall get in the papers
Well give our photographs to The Daily Glass before we start
I expect we shall see one another in the chapel on Sundays and I shall write to you in blood every day darling on a piece of my mattress
The letters will always be in the top lefthand corner of the steak pudding
Dont say I didnt tell you where to look
We shall be able to talk said I by rapping on the wall I mean
Certainly
Once for the letter A twice for the chambermaid three times for the boots
In the meantime Jonah and you will each have removed a large stone from the floor of your cells by means of a nail which he found in his soup
Say you work sixteen hours out of the twentyfour you ought to have burrowed outside the gates in about five years
Jill shuddered 
Austria would be rather nice just now wouldnt it
she ventured
We could go high up if it got hot of course said Daphne slowly and the airs nice  Ill find out what we do about shipping the car on Friday said Berry
I must have been tired for I never heard the teathings taken away
When I opened my eyes Berry and Co had gone
I looked at the jigsaw and began to wonder what had waked me
First of all said a quiet voice  I take five and threequarters
Do you think you can remember that
Ill try
Long ones of course
Yes please
Not the ordinary white kid I like the fawn suede ones
With pleasure
And now please can I be shown over the house
I turned and regarded her
Sitting easily in a chair to my right and a little behind me she was holding out to me a slip of paper
I took it mechanically but I did not look at it
Dont move for a minute or two I said 
You look absolutely splendid like that
She smiled
I rather think her frock was of linen at any rate it was blue
Her large straw hat was blue too and so were her smart French gloves and her dainty shoes her ankles were very pretty but her complexion was the thing She had one of the clearest skins I have ever seen and the delicate bloom of her cheeks was a wonder in itself
I could not well see her eyes for she was sitting with her head thrown back her gloved right hand behind it holding down the brim of her hat and as she was looking at me and not up into the sky they were almost hidden by their lids
Her left arm lay carelessly along the arm of the chair and her sleeve being loose and open I could see half a dozen inches of warm pink arm
I just looked at her
Done
she said
Not quite
I have said before and I say again that girls of this type ought not to be allowed to raise their eyebrows and smile faintly at the same moment
It amounts to a technical assault
I fancy she saw me set my teeth for the next moment she put up her left hand and bent the broad blue rim over her face
Early closing day she said
I contemplated her ankles in silence
After a minute Well
said my companion from behind the brim
I hate it when the blinds are down said I  but  But what
Happily they are only short blinds
In other words just as the ostrich when pursued is said to thrust its head into the sand believing  And now please can I be shown over the house
I glanced at the ordertoview which she had handed me
It referred to The Grange which stood in its own grounds about half a mile away
Its lodge gates were rather like ours
The same mistake had been made before
The agent at Bettshanger gave me that today and I motored over this afternoon
The cars outside
I was walking up the drive how pretty it all is
when I saw you asleep here
I suppose I ought to have gone up to the house really but it looked so nice and cool here that I came and sat down instead and waited for you to wake
Im so glad you did
Why
Well you see theyre rather a queer lot up there at the house might have said you couldnt see over or something
She opened her big eyes
But Ive got an order
Thats the worst of it
Theyll take orders from no one
Once theyd caught sight of it you would have been blindfolded and led back to the village by a circuitous route
Nonsense
Its a fact
But Ill show you round all right
Anything I can tell you about the place before we move
She regarded me suspiciously
Then Is there a billiardroom
she said
Certainly
And a table complete with three balls one of latest modelsslate bed pneumatic cushions
Be careful of the top one it bust the other day
The butler had pumped it up too tight
Servants hall
Every time
All the domestic offices are noble
Telephone
Of course
In case of fire call Fire Brigade
No number required
Speak direct to firestation
Give address of fire
Thats useful
Rather
Youll have them up under the hour if they can get the horses
All the same I dont think we shall come here
You see I didnt know it was an asylum
Its very cheap said I
I can do it at ten guineas a week without the inspectionpit that is
She leaned forward and laughed
Oh dear
she said what a thing it is to be really silly sometimes
She got up and smoothed down her dress
And now please can I be shown over the house
With pleasure I said getting up
That is unless youd rather see The Grange first
She stared at me for a moment then she snatched the order out of my hand
Whats this place
she demanded
White Ladies
Are you trying to let it
Well we havent thought  And youve let me sit here all this time making a fool of myself when you knew perfectly well  Five and threequarters was it
She stamped her foot
Dear pretty Girl Blue dont be angry
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
I know but Im so busy just now that its done for me
My sister is ashamed of me every evening at eight fifteen
Matinees on Wednesdays at two
Could you come one day
She laughed in spite of herself
Then And now where is this Grange place
Next but one on the right but it looks rotten in the evening
Its only just five
Besides they had measles there last May stacks of them
Stacks of what
Measles
One of them escaped one day and was brought back by the village cornerboy
He said hed have kept it only he hadnt got a dog licence
 But The Grange has got a ghost hasnt it
And I love ghosts
The Grey Lady
My dear shes gone
Always used to walk the back stairs on third Fridays and one night the servants left the lights on
She gave notice the next day
Wanted a change I think
You see shed been in one place nearly two hundred years
Besides the stairs were bad
Its a nice house isnt it
Pretty well
But it hasnt got a priests hole
What does that matter
Well where are you going to keep the gorgonzolas
She leaned on the back of a chair and began to laugh helplessly
Presently You wretched man
she said 
Im really awfully angry with you
I knew it
Be quiet
Youve wasted my time here until its too late for me to see The Grange and what on earth I shall tell father I dont know
Hes not outside
In the car
You dont think I should still be here if he was
No I came over alone
Thats all right
Now youll be able to help me with this jigsaw
She gave rather a good gasp at that
Girl Blue please
Youve heaps of time because if youd gone to The Grange you wouldnt have got away yet
And its a nice jigsaw quite one of the family
Eats out of your hand I suppose
Rather
And sits up and barks for Baldwin and all the rest of it
A Young Diana its called
Appeared in last years Academy and  But she was down on her knees on the lawn staring at the tray by now
I joined her wondering a little
Thats a bit of Merrylegs she said picking up one of the pieces and theres another
Thats a bit of her dear nose and theres her white stocking
Look here well do her first
I sat down on the turf and looked at her
Either I said slowly either youre a witch and that isnt allowed or else youve had to learn this picture some time as a punishment
She laughed
I sat for it she explained
Thats all
It was my turn to gasp
Its hanging in the diningroom at home now
Come along
Theres a bit of my habit
Keep it with Merrylegs
Ill fit them together in a minute
I took off my coat kneeled down beside her and began to receive Merrylegs piecemeal
When she had picked out all of the mare she cleared a little space and began fitting the bits together at a rate that was astonishing
Then she turned her attention to the background
Laid upon its side the mysterious ladder became a distant fence and little by little a landscape grew into being under her small fingers
Suddenly she caught my arm
Somebodys coming
she whispered
I heard footsteps crunch on a paths gravel then all was silent again
Whoever it was was coming towards us over the lawn
A clump of rhododendrons hid us from them and them from us
Behind there
I whispered pointing to three tall elms at our back which grew so close together that they formed a giant screen
She was out of sight in a second and I had just time to throw my coat over the jigsaw and sit down upon the glove she had dropped before Berry appeared
Hullo
he said
Hullo
said I
What are you doing
Doing
Yes you know executing performing carrying out
Go away
I said
You are trespassing upon a private reverie
Didnt you see the notice
He shook his head
You have as it were burst rudely open the door of the brown study in which I am communing with Nature and one or two of my imaginations friends
Kindly apologize and withdraw closing the door as you go
All right Omar
Wheres your Thou
You frightened her away
Berry grinned
Heard the pattering of my little feet I suppose
Yes
She wouldnt believe it was only footsteps but let that pass
If she were to hear the same noise forgive me retreating she would probably return
Really think so
That is my steadfast conviction
Well you go indoors and well see
If I dont follow you in five minutes youll know youre right
Friend said I the indecency of your suggestion is almost grotesque
To impose upon a timid trusting Thou is either base or dastardly I forget which
I am glad none of the others were here to hear what I feel sure to have been but a thoughtless idle word
I shant say anything about it so no one except you and me will ever know and even if I cannot ever forget I shall come to forgive it in years to come
Time will heal the wound brother
Till then wheres the jigsaw
An evil beast hath devoured it
It is without doubt rent in pieces
In which case I shall prefer a bill of indictment against you as accessory for mutilation next autumn assize
I warn you
Thanks
I shall see you at dinner shant I
Not that I want to but I just shall
Berry sighed
From your manner more than from what you say anyone would think you wanted me to go old chap
Of course I know you so it doesnt matter but you ought to be more careful
No Ive not taken offence because I know none was meant but Im going to go just to teach you a lesson
Yes I am
Give my love to Thou wont you
Certainly not
Shes had one shock already this afternoon
Oh was today the first time shed seen you
He strolled back to the house
When I heard his footsteps on the gravel again I got up and peered through the rhododendrons
I watched him go indoors and turned to see the girl once more on her knees by the jigsaw
I kneeled opposite her and watched her at work
After a moment she glanced up and met my eyes
Youll see the picture better from this side she said
Which picture
Round you come
I crawled to her side with a sigh
On she went at a wonderful pace
Old elms rose up in the background a splash of red and brown resolved itself into a sunny farm and four pieces which Berry had recognized as water went to make up a sheltered haystack
When it was nearly finished she leaned across me and looked at my wristwatch
Ill just have time she whispered half to herself
Only just
Only just
Did you speak
Yes I did
I said Damn
And Ill say it again
She leaned on my shoulder and laughed for a second
Then Im sure you wouldnt find that in the Rubaiyat
Perhaps Thou didnt have to be back in time for dinner
She fell to work again but I could see she was smiling
The loose pieces left were very few now
A tuft of grass fell into place a wisp of smoke stole out of the farmhouse chimney a quickset hedge sprang up in the distance landscape and sky merged on the horizon and the thing was done
She sat back on her heels and regarded it for a moment
Then she slipped sideways on to the lawn smoothed down her frock and looked at me
Not bad is it
she said
Its sweet
You ought to see the original
I have
Thats why I love it
I shall have it framed and keep it in memory of this private view
Sentiment with a vengeance
What if it is Girl Blue
For answer she began to pull on her gloves
I watched her in silence
When they were both on she rose and so did I
Ill go as I came she said 
Dont come with me to the gate
I bowed
She put out her hand
I bent over it
Goodbye I said
Goodbye and and thanks for  For what Girl Blue
For not asking any questions
I smiled and turned away
Then I kneeled down suddenly and kissed the face that looked up out of the picture the face that would have meant nothing two hours before the face that looked out into the clear breeze and over the open country the face that As this is quite a private view said the original speaking very slowly and as tomorrow you wont be able to  I didnt hear the rest of the sentence
Before I had finished my second cigarette Berry Daphne and Jill came round the bank of rhododendrons
Why Boy said Jill have you been here all the time
A cry from Daphne interrupted her
The next moment they were all down on their knees poring over my late companions handiwork
A moment later as with one consent they all looked up and stared at me
I looked away and smoked with careless deliberation
How on earth have you done it
gasped Daphne
Done what
said I
Oh that
Oh it wasnt very hard
You must be better at them than you were on Saturday said Jill
Have you been practising at the Blahs
I felt Berry was looking at me and waited
Then it was a glove you were sitting on he said slowly
Berrys a nut every time
It was the first week in October and we were back in town
They were all out but me
Sunday afternoon it was and I was alone in the library finishing a little work
I do work sometimes
Suddenly the telephone went
I picked up the receiver
Is that the garage
said Girl Blue
No dear
Its me
How are you
Why its you
I know
I said so just now
Youre looking splendid
Oh I am glad
Ive waited such a long time
You must thank the Exchange not me
Dont rub it in
Well goodbye
I dont think youre very kind Girl Blue
No
No I dont
Ive got the gloves by the way
Thank you
Ill send them to you care of Charing Cross Post Office if you like unless youd rather I buried them six paces due east of the fourteenth lamppost on the west side of Edgware Road
I think she said slowly I think I may as well take them with me
Certainly madam
Sign please
But when dear
Well I shall be at the Albert Hall next Friday
Girl Blue
I dont suppose youre going but perhaps you could send them by someone who  Under what symbol shall I meet her
Wait a moment
You shall have the seventh waltz  Only seven
Where is he
What is his name
You heard what I said
And well meet under oh under  Mistletoe said I
Goodbye
Goodbye
Oh Girl Blue I forgot to say  Number please
said Exchange
Youve cut me off
I roared
Sorry
A pause
Then Here you are
Hullo dear
I said
Is that the cab rank
said a mans fat voice
No it isnt said I
And youve got an ugly face and flat feet and I hate you
Then I rang off
CHAPTER XV ALL FOUND I had seen her but once before and that was at the Savoy on New Years Eve
She had been with her party at one table and I with mine at another
And in the midst of the reveling I had chanced to look up and into one of the great mirrors which made a panel upon the wall
There I had seen the girl sitting back in her chair smiling and fresh and whiteshouldered in a dress of black and gold her fingers about the stem of her goblet
Not talking listening rather to the words of a man at her side whose eyes were watching her smiling lips somewhat greedily
He had red hair I remember and a moustache brushed up to hide a long upper lip
And as I looked she also had looked up and our eyes had met
There and then I had raised my wine and toasted her her of the lookingglass
The smile had deepened
Then she had raised her glass and drunk to me in return
That was all
And when Berry had leaned across the table and asked Whos your friend
I wish I knew
Pshaw
said my brotherinlaw
I say it deliberately
I drank to a thought said I
Believe me
After all a thought is a reflection
And now here she was sitting in the grass by the wayside
Shes brown isnt she
said I
As a berry
I like his breeches
I bowed
Thank you
And for youpicturesque is the word one of the words
Shall I compare you to a summers day
Id rather you collected that cow
Shes getting too near the river for my liking
Im looking after the dears
Are you
said I
But But what
Quis custodiet  The apple she threw passed over my shoulder
Mountains and valleys swift rivers and curling roads here and there a village shining in the hot sun and once in a while a castle in the woods whitewalled redroofed peaceful enough now in its old age but hinting at wild oats sown and reaped when it was young
Hinting broadly too
At nights shaken with the flare of torches and the clash of arms at oaths and laughter and the tinkle of spurs on the worn steps at threats and bloodlettings and all the good old ways now dead out of date and less indebted to memory than imagination
And then at galleries with creaking floors at arras and the rustle of a dress whisperings too and the proud flash of eyes hands lilywhite whose fingers men must kiss and in the eyes mirror themselves
But these things are not dead
Oldfashioned wrath is over gone to its long home love is not even wrinkled
Yet again it was before wrath
I set out to describe the province of Krain and now I have strayed from the highway up one of those curling roads to one of those white castles only to lose myself in the thicket of Romance beyond
Perhaps it does not matter
Anyway it was on the slope of a green meadow all among the mountains of Krain that the girl was sitting herself unminded minding her cows
And out of the woods above her a round white tower proclaimed a chateau set on the shoulder of a hill
Her dress was that of the country and yet perhaps rather such as Croatian peasants wear
All white linen embroidered ever so richly cut low and round at the neck and with the skirt falling some four inches below her knee short sleeves a small white apron and over her thick fair hair a bright red kerchief
But her stockings were of white silk and small black buckled slippers kept the little feet
Clear blue eyes hers and a small merry mouth and a skin after the suns own heart
It was so brown such an even delicate brown
Brown cheeks and temples brown arms and hands brown throat
Oh very picturesque
I rounded up the cow errant returned to my lady and took my seat by her side
Thank you she said
And now who are you and what do you want
My name said I is Norval
And I want to know the way to the pageantground and when does your scene come on
It is a nice dress isnt it
She rose and stood smoothing her frock and apron
Sweet
Only you ought to have bare brown legs
My dear man this isnt the Garden of Eden
No
Some other Paradise I suppose
Old Omars perhaps
Besides I forgot
Dolls never go barefoot do they
Dolls
Yes
Arent you the great big beautiful doll they sing of
She threw back her head and laughed at that pleasedly
Then she began to sing softly Oh you beautiful doll You great big beautiful doll We finished the verse together the cows watching us with big eyes
I think were rather good said I when it was over
I know were both mad said she
And I dont feel a bit like singing really either
Oh great and beautiful one said I what is the matter
Indicate to me the fly that dares to lurk in this fair bowl of ointment
She looked away over the river
Then After all its nothing to do with you
Nothing whatever
said I
Then why do you ask
Something to say I suppose
Is not the clemency of the weather delightful
Yes but those cows belong to me
I laughed scornfully
Then My aunt has four eggs I said simply
She turned away ostensibly to pick a flower but I saw her shoulders shaking
At length There is a pig in the grass she said
Its name is Norval
The doll is on its hind legs I replied getting up
As for me is it not that I shall have been about to go
Adieu mademoiselle
Er au revoir monsieur
Thats better said I
And now whats the trouble my dear
Well it was about the chauffeur
You see she was spending the summer here in the chateau
Yes the chateau above us white on the hillside
She and a companion a girl alone with a household of their own very happy very comfortable We are really you know
Dont think were suffragists
Truth is Id got about sick of men and thought Id take a rest
I heard of this old place to be let furnished came to see if it was half as nice as it sounded and never even went back to England to collect Betty
Just couldnt leave it
Betty followed posthaste with the servants and heavy luggage and and  And the parrot
I hazarded
No
Oh the linen and everything
Id got the car with me
Weve been here nearly two months now and I love it more every day
Dont miss men a bit either
This last in an inimitable tone half nonchalant half defiant
I expect they do most of the missing
Thanks awfully
However I may tell you the familys been rather narky  I beg your pardon
Narky
Like a nark
Of course
How stupid of me
Same root as snirksome
As you were
Well rather ratty about it all
Said it was all ridiculous and unheard of
Did they use the word proceeding
They did
Ah
The one thing that sort of stopped them from really doing anything was the fact that Betty was with me
Bettys dear and they all know it
And her being here I suppose seemed to save it from being whats called an impossible position
Well a week ago comes a letter from the Brethes thats my uncle and aunt saying theyre motoring through Austria to Italy and are going to stay a night at Laipnik on the way
Would like to run over and see me as they understand Savavic thats me is only thirty miles away
All very nice
Sweet of them
I agreed
Isnt it
Only three days ago Betty gets a wire to say her mothers ill and she has to bolt for the night train to Paris
Yes
So that uncle dear mustnt come to Savavic at any price
If he does Bettys absence becomes apparent and the good old impossible position arises at once
Consequently I send a nice letter to the one hotel at Laipnik to await arrival saying the roads so bad and hard to find that Ill come over to them instead of their coming here
Much as you would have loved them to see Savavic
Exactly
Youre rather intelligent
Oh Im often like that
Its in the blood
Grandpa got his BA I explained
Weve loaned his hood to the Wallace Collection
Go on
Well that all sounds very nice and easy doesnt it
Then to put the lid on my chauffeur breaks his arm yesterday afternoon
And the uncles due when
Slept at Laipnik last night
I was to have lunched with them today
Oh the fats in the fire all right this time
I may expect them any time after three
I reflected a moment
Then Ill drive you to Laipnik said I
Im as safe as a house at the wheel
Youre awfully good and kind said the girl shaking her head but its no good
Think
How on earth would I explain you
It is unnecessary to explain a chauffeur
Oh but you cant  Certainly I can
At any rate Im going to
Come along and get changed mistress
I scrambled to my feet
If youll show me the way to the garage Ill be looking over the car
What is she by the way
And where does your late chauffeur keep his boots
Are you an angel
said the girl getting up
Who told you
said I
The boots were much too big and the gaiters a little small
Still they did
A long dustcoat came down over the tops of the gaiters making the uniform unnecessary
I took the cap to wear when we reached the town
Gloves near enough
It was a big open car and all the way to Laipnik the girl looking priceless in a fawncoloured dress sat by my side
We went like the wind
After a while He drives well said my companion half to herself
Thank you beautiful doll I should say madam
Is that right
Quite thanks
How are the boots
A bit spacious
Im afraid Ive lost one of my toes already
You poor man
Which one
Baldwin said I
Hes got separated from the others you know
Ill be able to look for him when we get to Laipnik
Told them to keep together too I added bitterly
She gave a little peal of laughter
Then How tiresome she said
And Im afraid your calves werent made for those gaiters
I admit they dont fit as well as your stockings but  Norval
Madam
Behave yourself
Very good madam
By the way what about my wages
What do you suggest
I shant object to anything reasonable
No
Well I was getting eleventhree a yar day in my last place and all found especially all
All founds rather a dangerous phrase
Not at all
It only means washing and beer and the English papers when youve done with them and meat on Sundays
A smile too when Im tired and a word of thanks after seventy miles in the rain with a head wind
It might cover a multitude of sins Norval
Here I saved a dogs life and passed two wagons before their drivers had had time to inspire the horses with the terror they felt themselves
Then All founds all right if you know your man said I
But I dont
I caught her laughing eyes in the windscreen and straightway drank to them from an imaginary wineglass
She smiled gently and the eyes looked away with the look that sees at once not at all and yet farthest
She was gazing down the vista of memory
Then its a compact I said quietly
Sealed with a drink
I never drank to you this time Norval
Yes you did said I
Only with thine eyes doll beautiful
You forget yourself
I remember you
You were wearing a black and gold dress
Sweet you looked
She turned away and pointed to a church we were leaving on our right
That she said is a church
You amaze me
I thought it was a swimmingbath
She bit the lip that wanted to smile
To return to you who are my mutton I wish this road wasnt so narrow
I cant look at you except in the screen
We first met in a lookingglass
True
But now I want something moremore tangible
Indeed
I glanced down
At any rate Ive got your feet bless them
I shall compose a sonnet to them beautiful doll
And Ill write an epic about yours
Five minutes passed
Hows the epic going
said I
Ive only done four lines
Lets have them
The beetling beetlecrushing baulks of boots Crashed on their thunderous way while menatarms Who knew no fear shuddered and crossed themselves And little children whimpered with a fright Too fierce for tears
Very good said I
Now you shall have mine
I thought they were stars And I know they were shining But so brightly
The daintiest things that were ever created
They danced on my heart from the moment I saw them But so lightly That while they were there my heart became lighter Yet on it they made an enduring impression Lasting and deep
Fairies steps may be slighter But so slightly
Youll think I am mad but Im only a blighter
I thought they were stars And I know they were shining
Thank you very much
I didnt know you were a poet
Nor was I till I entered your service said I
So presently we came to Laipnik
I stopped outside the little town put on my cap and settled the girl on the back seat
Five minutes later we rolled up to the hotel
On the steps stood a stout man with a serious face looking suspiciously at the cigar he had just lighted
Hullo Uncle Dick said my mistress
My dear child I am glad youve come
You aunts upstairs rather tired but wild to see you
Were going to stay another night here and go on early tomorrow
Are you
Ill come up at once
I opened the door of the car and handed her out
She kissed her relative and turned to me
Er will you er  I coughed
You will get your own lunch Norval and come to the office for orders at halfpast two
Very good madam
As I raised my cap Oh I feel such a beast she murmured
I never gave Berry and the others a thought till I had eaten my lunch and was musing over my coffee with a cigarette
They were coming in the car from Salzburg and were going to join me this evening at a farm called Poganec where I had slept last night and where we were all going to stay
We had told people we were going to fish
I think Jonah meant it
We others were going to sleep and watch him and sleep again
Now Poganec and Savavic were only seven miles apart and were served by the same post office
In fact they were at opposite ends of the same valley in the midst of which halfway between the two our common village slept in the hot sun
It was in the course of my first walk that I had come upon Savavic
And now instead of being at Poganec to welcome them this afternoon here was I at Laipnik pretending to be a chauffeur
What did it matter
I should be back that evening
Only seven miles At halfpast two I was at the office and at twentynine minutes to three my lady appeared in the hall
I went to her cap in hand
She turned and walked to a little loungeplace out of sight of the office
I followed her there
For a moment she did not speak
Then Oh I feel such a beast
she said passionately
Such a beast
Dont take your cap off to me
Put it on
For heavens sake put it on
And sit down
Sprawl about
Light a cigarette
Shake me
Kiss me if you like
Anything to show youre my own class and not a servant
She stopped and passed a hand over her eyes
Then she spoke hopelessly
And all the time its no good
Youve got to take us out for a drive and Ive got to treat you you like a servant
And youve got to say Yes madam and No madam and have your tea alone and Oh what on earth did I do it for
She was on the verge of tears
I put my hands on her shoulders and looked into her eyes
My dear beautiful doll dont take it all so seriously
Its only a game
Were both playacting
Youve just got to keep it up and order me about in the most monstrously imperious manner this afternoon and then in the evening were going to drive home together
And Im going to get some of my own back then I dont mind telling you
Ill sprawl and smoke cigarettes and shake you and What else was it you said
I havent forgotten that you agreed to all found you know
You wait
And I think your eyes are absolutely wonderful
How did it go
I thought they were stars And I know they were shining
She looked me full in the eyes now and a grand smile swept into her face
Then she put her arms round my neck and kissed me
The next moment she was halfway up the broad stairs
Ten minutes later I brought the car round to the door
Niece and uncle and aunt all sat together on the back seat
As I shut the door We dont want to go too far Norval or too fast
Lady Brethe is rather tired
I think about twenty miles out and twenty back will do
About two hours altogether
Yes madam
Shall I go towards Savavic
Yes I think so
We had done our twenty miles out and I was looking for a place to turn the car when I caught sight of Poganec below us in the valley by road some three or four miles away
Then suddenly for the first time a terrible thought flashed into my mind
We were on the very road which Berry and the others must take coming from Salzburg
Supposing we met them
Here the road broadened so I slowed down and in response to a nod from my mistress proceeded to turn round
I accomplished the manoeuvre as in a dream and ended by stopping the engine
This brought me to my senses
As we started off again I became cooler
After all very likely we should not meet them
The chances were against it
And if we did I could accelerate and push by them before they knew where they were
Again Here we swung round a corner and there fifty paces away by the side of the road in the hot afternoon sun stood our car my car Berry and Cos car
The bonnet was open and Jonahs head and hands were inside it
Daphne sat still on the back seat while Jill was sitting on the bank a posy of wild flowers in her hand
Berry leaned easily against the side of the car his hat over his eyes watching Jonah at work
From his attitude he appeared to be offering idiotic advice
So I saw them for less than a second for the instant they heard us coming all four started and looked up
I was wondering whether I dared accelerate and dash by like a madman
I dare say the girl was thinking the same
But her uncle settled it
Hullo he said
Fellowmotorists in trouble
English apparently too
Wonder if we  And the worthy aunt put the lid on
Why she said  if it isnt those nice children we met at the Europe at Salzburg Dick
There was nothing to be done now
I just slowed down
Very slowly we drew abreast and all the time till we stopped I leaned forward and gazed at the four in turn openmouthed they were bending my brows into the fiercest frown and laying my fingers on my lips
Then How dye do
said Lord Brethe
Berry swallowed said  Er oh how dye do
and took off his hat
The next moment he had himself in hand
Daphne got out of the car and Jonah and Jill came up
Greetings were exchanged between them and the Brethes and my mistress was introduced
I sat as one in a trance
Then I heard the girl saying nervously I dont know whether my chauffeur can be of any assistance
I pulled myself together and got out of the car
There never was such a situation
The Brethes knew nothing and thought nothing
The girl unaware that these were my own people saw me being used and treated as a chauffeur by four strangers while she looked on and got the thanks and the thought made her writhe
Berry and the others found me about to call them  Sir and  Madam and to serve them by mending my own car in the capacity of chauffeur to somebody they had never seen
And I wanted to burst out into hysterical laughter swear kick Berry and hide in the woods
Instead of which I went up to Jonah who had gone back to the engine
Whats the trouble sir
Jonah put his head into the bonnet and exploded with silent laughter
I put my head in too and swore at him in a whisper
Then One of the cylinders has been missing since Krainbach he said
I think thats the seat of the trouble
But Ive only just  I think its the carburettor sir said I with a finger on the float
Theres practically no petrol in it
I tried the pressure pump but it was no good
The petrol pipe was stopped up properly
Youll have to have the pipe down sir
Its the only way
How long will that take
said Lord Brethe who was standing on the other side of the car talking to Berry
Its halfanhours job at least my lord
Oh well youd better do it
Hadnt he Dolly
We arent pressed for time are we my dear
Oh no
That is I mean of course
Please do everything you can Norval
Very good madam
I got some tools out of the toolbox and began to take the pipe down
Hadnt you better take your dustcoat off man
said Berry
No thank you sir
Berry turned to Lord Brethe who had come to watch the operation
All this comes throughletting my young brotherinlaw play about with the car he explained airily
No really
said Lord Brethe
Yes said Berry
Hes done more damage the few times hes driven it than a skilled chauffeur would do in five years
Dear me said the other
Knows nothing of the mechanism I suppose
Doesnt know the difference between the carburettor and the er exhaust
Lord Brethe laughed
Dear dear
These young men he said
Here the spanner I was using slipped off a nut
Gently my man gently said Berry pleasantly
Yes said Lord Brethe be careful of the paint
I almost choked
Wont you two come and talk to us
the girl called from the other side of the road
I always like watching a repair dear replied her uncle
And Mr Pleydel is an expert
I think Id better be here just to supervise said Berry
Er have you your cottonwaste handy man
Its on the step sir I said with an effort
Do you want it
No no
But you should always keep it by you
I wiped the sweat off my forehead
Will you smoke
said Lord Brethe producing a cigarcase
Ah thanks said Berry
With the tail of my eye I saw that it was a Corona Corona
By this time I had taken the pipe down
It was choked with a regular wad of dirt
I remembered bitterly that when I left them at Strasburg I had begged them never to fill up without a filter
So that was the obstruction
said his lordship
I straightened my back
Comes of not using a filter my lord
Berrys brows contracted
He touched the wad with his foot
No he said loftily
This has clearly worked in from the engine
It is a piece of valvepacking
I sighed
Heaven only knows what he thought he meant
But old Brethe lapped it up
Heavily I began to replace the pipe
As I unscrewed them I put the nuts on the step
Now one was missing
It had rolled off
Lost something
said Berry
A nut sir
I shall see it directly
Never put anything where it can roll off man
When you are executing a repair always lay your tools on the ground and mark the place
Its quicker in the long run
Found it
Yes sir
Wipe it carefully before replacing it
He turned to Lord Brethe
Youll excuse me but you cant be too careful can you
No indeed
Quite right quite right said the old fool
Were none of us too old to learn
The repair was finished at last
I started up the engine just to make sure she was all right put away the tools wiped my hands on a piece of cottonwaste and resumed my seat in my ladys car without a word
The girl looking flushed and anxious followed her aunt into the car
Lord Brethe climbed in after them
The others stood round
Its been awfully kind of you to lend us your chauffeur like this said Daphne
I dont know  Oh er thats all right stammered the girl
Only too glad said Lord Brethe
Mr Pleydels been very good and given him several wrinkles well worth having
Dont mention it said Berry with a smirk
Here you are my man 
I took the crown he offered me in silence and raised my hat
A crown is worth ten pence
As I was letting in the clutch I heard Jills voice on my left
Thank you very much indeed for helping us so beautifully she said and laid her posy of wild flowers on the seat by my side
Thank you madam
As we moved off What a queer child
said Lady Brethe
Two hours later the girl and I slipped once more out of Laipnik
When we were clear of the town I stopped for a moment and she took her old seat by my side
For a minute or two neither of us spoke
Then she reached up and took off my cap and pitched it behind into the car
I laughed
I wanted to do that a dozen times this afternoon she said
And Id have done it too if Id had the courage of a fieldmouse
You know what Ive wanted to do a dozen times this afternoon dont you
And these odious people
Will you ever forgive me
If its any consolation to you I nearly died of shame
And I nearly punched Berrys head and spoiled it all
Berrys
I explained
When I had finished It was nice of Jill to give you those flowers she said
Dear of her
But I shall never forgive Berry
Hes only human said I
And he really was awfully funny
I shall tell him what I think of him
Weve all done that once a week for five years
My dear hes quite hopeless
Besides he gave me a whole crown
And uncle gave you five
I saw him
I nearly cried it made me so angry
Six altogether said I 
I bought you some carnations with them
Theyre in the hood
Sweet of you Norval
Coals of fire
No dear
Only malmaisons
Isnt that beautiful
We had climbed until we were at the top of a pass
Over the mountains the sun was going down
The great valley was already in shadow but the light on the high woods was wonderful
Away on the top of a hill a little white shrine stood up like a candlestick against the sky
A rosy flush lay on the distant snow mountains and the heavens themselves were filled with a great red glory
The same thought occurred to both of us
Who wouldnt be a day
said I
Its worth living only twelve hours to die a death like that
We reached Savavic about halfpast seven
I drove straight to the garage
She watched me put the car away and waited while I slipped into my brogues
Then Now I must be off to Poganec said I
So endeth the first days service
And the last
I drew myself up
Am I dismissed then
Oh well  Of course if youre not satisfied madam  But I am only  Then said I Ill stop on
Good night beautiful Doll
Dolly Dolly then
I swept off my hat and turned to go
Dont you want to er shake me
said Dolly
I reached Poganec just as they were finishing dinner
As I entered the room Hullo said Berry
This your night out
Thatll do
said I
You had your show this afternoon
My show
My humiliation said my brotherinlaw
Think of it
My wifes brother in service
How can I ever hold up this noble head again
And this after all my years of striving to elevate
But there
Can the leopard change his spots or the chauffeur his boots
By the way how did you get into them
Rather a tight fit wasnt it
You dont look very penitent
I suppose you know Im bowed with grief
I see youre gorged with food said I
Havent you any dinner for me
Its in a red handkerchief by the coachhouse door said Berry
Now you can go
I shant want you any more tonight
Dont forget the ah wrinkle I gave you about the cottonwaste
Fancy Boy earning some money
said Daphne
What wages dyou get
Sixandtenpencefarthing a week said I and all found
Thats a dangerous phrase said Jonah
Might mean anything
Exactly said Berry
It includes boots we know
What else besides boots
Depends on the man said I
It does said Daphne
And thats why youve got to give notice at once
Notice
I felt Jills hand pushing my hair back from my forehead
She was standing behind my chair
Yes she said and come back to us
Fact is Boy we cant spare you
