Derelict PART ONE CHAPTER I THE EARLY MARRIED LIFE OF THE MORELS THE BOTTOMS succeeded to Hell Row
Hell Row was a block of thatched bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane
There lived the colliers who worked in the little ginpits two fields away
The brook ran under the alder trees scarcely soiled by these small mines whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin
And all over the countryside were these same pits some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth making queer mounds and little black places among the cornfields and the meadows
And the cottages of these coalminers in blocks and pairs here and there together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers straying over the parish formed the village of Bestwood
Then some sixty years ago a sudden change took place
The ginpits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers
The coal and iron field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered
Carston Waite and Co appeared
Amid tremendous excitement Lord Palmerston formally opened the companys first mine at Spinney Park on the edge of Sherwood Forest
About this time the notorious Hell Row which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation was burned down and much dirt was cleansed away
Carston Waite  Co found they had struck on a good thing so down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall new mines were sunk until soon there were six pits working
From Nuttall high up on the sandstone among the woods the railway ran past the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hoods Well down to Spinney Park then on to Minton a large mine among cornfields from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to Bunkers Hill branching off there and running north to Beggarlee and Selby that looks over at Crich and the hills of Derbyshire six mines like black studs on the countryside linked by a loop of fine chain the railway
To accommodate the regiments of miners Carston Waite and Co built the Squares great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood and then in the brook valley on the site of Hell Row they erected the Bottoms
The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners dwellings two rows of three like the dots on a blanksix domino and twelve houses in a block
This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from Bestwood and looked out from the attic windows at least on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby
The houses themselves were substantial and very decent
One could walk all round seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block sweetwilliams and pinks in the sunny top block seeing neat front windows little porches little privet hedges and dormer windows for the attics
But that was outside that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers wives
The dwellingroom the kitchen was at the back of the house facing inward between the blocks looking at a scrubby back garden and then at the ashpits
And between the rows between the long lines of ashpits went the alley where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked
So the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms that was so well built and that looked so nice were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ashpits
Mrs Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms which was already twelve years old and on the downward path when she descended to it from Bestwood
But it was the best she could do
Moreover she had an end house in one of the top blocks and thus had only one neighbour on the other side an extra strip of garden
And having an end house she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the between houses because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week
But this superiority in station was not much consolation to Mrs Morel
She was thirtyone years old and had been married eight years
A rather small woman of delicate mould but resolute bearing she shrank a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women
She came down in the July and in the September expected her third baby
Her husband was a miner
They had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes or fair began
Morel she knew was sure to make a holiday of it
He went off early on the Monday morning the day of the fair
The two children were highly excited
William a boy of seven fled off immediately after breakfast to prowl round the wakes ground leaving Annie who was only five to whine all morning to go also
Mrs Morel did her work
She scarcely knew her neighbours yet and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl
So she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner
William appeared at halfpast twelve
He was a very active lad fairhaired freckled with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him
Can I have my dinner mother
he cried rushing in with his cap on
Cause it begins at halfpast one the man says so
You can have your dinner as soon as its done replied the mother
Isnt it done
he cried his blue eyes staring at her in indignation
Then Im goin beout it
Youll do nothing of the sort
It will be done in five minutes
It is only halfpast twelve
Theyll be beginnin the boy half cried half shouted
You wont die if they do said the mother
Besides its only halfpast twelve so youve a full hour
The lad began hastily to lay the table and directly the three sat down
They were eating batterpudding and jam when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff
Some distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merrygoround and the tooting of a horn
His face quivered as he looked at his mother
I told you
he said running to the dresser for his cap
Take your pudding in your handand its only five past one so you were wrongyou havent got your twopence cried the mother in a breath
The boy came back bitterly disappointed for his twopence then went off without a word
I want to go I want to go said Annie beginning to cry
Well and you shall go whining wizzening little stick
said the mother
And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child
The hay was gathered from the fields and cattle were turned on to the eddish
It was warm peaceful
Mrs Morel did not like the wakes
There were two sets of horses one going by steam one pulled round by a pony three organs were grinding and there came odd cracks of pistolshots fearful screeching of the cocoanut mans rattle shouts of the Aunt Sally man screeches from the peepshow lady
The mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the Lion Wallace booth at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men
She left him alone and went to get Annie a spin of toffee
Presently the lad stood in front of her wildly excited
You never said you was comingisnt the a lot of things that lions killed three menlve spent my tuppencean look here
He pulled from his pocket two eggcups with pink mossroses on them
I got these from that stall where yave ter get them marbles in them holes
An I got these two in two goesaepenny a gotheyve got mossroses on look here
I wanted these
She knew he wanted them for her
Hm
she said pleased
They ARE pretty
Shall you carry em cause Im frightened o breakin em
He was tipful of excitement now she had come led her about the ground showed her everything
Then at the peepshow she explained the pictures in a sort of story to which he listened as if spellbound
He would not leave her
All the time he stuck close to her bristling with a small boys pride of her
For no other woman looked such a lady as she did in her little black bonnet and her cloak
She smiled when she saw women she knew
When she was tired she said to her son Well are you coming now or later
Are you goin aready
he cried his face full of reproach
Already
It is past four I know
What are you goin aready for
he lamented
You neednt come if you dont want she said
And she went slowly away with her little girl whilst her son stood watching her cut to the heart to let her go and yet unable to leave the wakes
As she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars she heard men shouting and smelled the beer and hurried a little thinking her husband was probably in the bar
At about halfpast six her son came home tired now rather pale and somewhat wretched
He was miserable though he did not know it because he had let her go alone
Since she had gone he had not enjoyed his wakes
Has my dad been
he asked
No said the mother
Hes helping to wait at the Moon and Stars
I seed him through that black tin stuff wi holes in on the window wi his sleeves rolled up
Ha
exclaimed the mother shortly
Hes got no money
An hell be satisfied if he gets his lowance whether they give him more or not
When the light was fading and Mrs Morel could see no more to sew she rose and went to the door
Everywhere was the sound of excitement the restlessness of the holiday that at last infected her
She went out into the side garden
Women were coming home from the wakes the children hugging a white lamb with green legs or a wooden horse
Occasionally a man lurched past almost as full as he could carry
Sometimes a good husband came along with his family peacefully
But usually the women and children were alone
The stayathome mothers stood gossiping at the corners of the alley as the twilight sank folding their arms under their white aprons
Mrs Morel was alone but she was used to it
Her son and her little girl slept upstairs so it seemed her home was there behind her fixed and stable
But she felt wretched with the coming child
The world seemed a dreary place where nothing else would happen for herat least until William grew up
But for herself nothing but this dreary endurancetill the children grew up
And the children
She could not afford to have this third
She did not want it
The father was serving beer in a public house swilling himself drunk
She despised him and was tied to him
This coming child was too much for her
If it were not for William and Annie she was sick of it the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness
She went into the front garden feeling too heavy to take herself out yet unable to stay indoors
The heat suffocated her
And looking ahead the prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive
The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge
There she stood trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading beautiful evening
Opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures
The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light
The glow sank quickly off the field the earth and the hedges smoked dusk
As it grew dark a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair
Sometimes down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the hedges men came lurching home
One young man lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill and went with a crash into the stile
Mrs Morel shuddered
He picked himself up swearing viciously rather pathetically as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him
She went indoors wondering if things were never going to alter
She was beginning by now to realise that they would not
She seemed so far away from her girlhood she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater at Sheerness ten years before
What have I to do with it
she said to herself
What have I to do with all this
Even the child I am going to have
It doesnt seem as if I were taken into account
Sometimes life takes hold of one carries the body along accomplishes ones history and yet is not real but leaves oneself as it were slurred over
I wait Mrs Morel said to herselfI wait and what I wait for can never come
Then she straightened the kitchen lit the lamp mended the fire looked out the washing for the next day and put it to soak
After which she sat down to her sewing
Through the long hours her needle flashed regularly through the stuff
Occasionally she sighed moving to relieve herself
And all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had for the childrens sakes
At halfpast eleven her husband came
His cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache
His head nodded slightly
He was pleased with himself
Oh
Oh
waitin for me lass
Ive bin elpin Anthony an whats think hes gen me
Nowt br a lousy haefcrown an thats ivry penny He thinks youve made the rest up in beer she said shortly
An I aventthat I avent
You blieve me Ive ad very little this day I have an all
His voice went tender
Here an I browt thee a bit o brandysnap an a cocoanut for th children
He laid the gingerbread and the cocoanut a hairy object on the table
Nay tha niver said thankyer for nowt i thy life did ter
As a compromise she picked up the cocoanut and shook it to see if it had any milk
Its a good un you may back yer life o that
I got it fra Bill Hodgkisson
Bill I says tha non wants them three nuts does ter
Arena ter for giein me one for my bit of a lad an wench
I ham Walter my lad e says tae which on em ters a mind
An so I took one an thanked im
I didnt like ter shake it afore is eyes but e says Thad better mae sure its a good un Walt
An so yer see I knowed it was
Hes a nice chap is Bill Hodgkisson es a nice chap
A man will part with anything so long as hes drunk and youre drunk along with him said Mrs Morel
Eh tha mucky little ussy whos drunk I shd like ter know
said Morel
He was extraordinarily pleased with himself because of his days helping to wait in the Moon and Stars
He chattered on
Mrs Morel very tired and sick of his babble went to bed as quickly as possible while he raked the fire
Mrs Morel came of a good old burgher family famous independents who had fought with Colonel Hutchinson and who remained stout Congregationalists
Her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lacemarket at a time when so many lacemanufacturers were ruined in Nottingham
Her father George Coppard was an engineera large handsome haughty man proud of his fair skin and blue eyes but more proud still of his integrity
Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build
But her temper proud and unyielding she had from the Coppards
George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty
He became foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness
Mrs MorelGertrudewas the second daughter
She favoured her mother loved her mother best of all but she had the Coppards clear defiant blue eyes and their broad brow
She remembered to have hated her fathers overbearing manner towards her gentle humorous kindlysouled mother
She remembered running over the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat
She remembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she had gone to the dockyard for she was a delicate rather proud child
She remembered the funny old mistress whose assistant she had become whom she had loved to help in the private school
And she still had the Bible that John Field had given her
She used to walk home from chapel with John Field when she was nineteen
He was the son of a welltodo tradesman had been to college in London and was to devote himself to business
She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon when they had sat under the vine at the back of her fathers house
The sun came through the chinks of the vineleaves and made beautiful patterns like a lace scarf falling on her and on him
Some of the leaves were clean yellow like yellow flat flowers
Now sit still he had cried
Now your hair I dont know what it IS like
Its as bright as copper and gold as red as burnt copper and it has gold threads where the sun shines on it
Fancy their saying its brown
Your mother calls it mousecolour
She had met his brilliant eyes but her clear face scarcely showed the elation which rose within her
But you say you dont like business she pursued
I dont
I hate it
he cried hotly
And you would like to go into the ministry she half implored
I should
I should love it if I thought I could make a firstrate preacher
Then why dont youwhy DONT you
Her voice rang with defiance
If I were a man nothing would stop me
She held her head erect
He was rather timid before her
But my fathers so stiffnecked
He means to put me into the business and I know hell do it
But if youre a MAN
she had cried
Being a man isnt everything he replied frowning with puzzled helplessness
Now as she moved about her work at the Bottoms with some experience of what being a man meant she knew that it was NOT everything
At twenty owing to her health she had left Sheerness
Her father had retired home to Nottingham
John Fields father had been ruined the son had gone as a teacher in Norwood
She did not hear of him until two years later she made determined inquiry
He had married his landlady a woman of forty a widow with property
And still Mrs Morel preserved John Fields Bible
She did not now believe him to be Well she understood pretty well what he might or might not have been
So she preserved his Bible and kept his memory intact in her heart for her own sake
To her dying day for thirtyfive years she did not speak of him
When she was twentythree years old she met at a Christmas party a young man from the Erewash Valley
Morel was then twentyseven years old
He was well setup erect and very smart
He had wavy black hair that shone again and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved
His cheeks were ruddy and his red moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily
He had that rare thing a rich ringing laugh
Gertrude Coppard had watched him fascinated
He was so full of colour and animation his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque he was so ready and so pleasant with everybody
Her own father had a rich fund of humour but it was satiric
This mans was different soft nonintellectual warm a kind of gambolling
She herself was opposite
She had a curious receptive mind which found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk
She was clever in leading folk to talk
She loved ideas and was considered very intellectual
What she liked most of all was an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man
This she did not often enjoy
So she always had people tell her about themselves finding her pleasure so
In her person she was rather small and delicate with a large brow and dropping bunches of brown silk curls
Her blue eyes were very straight honest and searching
She had the beautiful hands of the Coppards
Her dress was always subdued
She wore dark blue silk with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops
This and a heavy brooch of twisted gold was her only ornament
She was still perfectly intact deeply religious and full of beautiful candour
Walter Morel seemed melted away before her
She was to the miner that thing of mystery and fascination a lady
When she spoke to him it was with a southern pronunciation and a purity of English which thrilled him to hear
She watched him
He danced well as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance
His grandfather was a French refugee who had married an English barmaidif it had been a marriage
Gertrude Coppard watched the young miner as he danced a certain subtle exultation like glamour in his movement and his face the flower of his body ruddy with tumbled black hair and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above
She thought him rather wonderful never having met anyone like him
Her father was to her the type of all men
And George Coppard proud in his bearing handsome and rather bitter who preferred theology in reading and who drew near in sympathy only to one man the Apostle Paul who was harsh in government and in familiarity ironic who ignored all sensuous pleasurehe was very different from the miner
Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment and had never learned even a Roger de Coverley
She was puritan like her father highminded and really stern
Therefore the dusky golden softness of this mans sensuous flame of life that flowed off his flesh like the flame from a candle not baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was seemed to her something wonderful beyond her
He came and bowed above her
A warmth radiated through her as if she had drunk wine
Now do come and have this one wi me he said caressively
Its easy you know
Im pining to see you dance
She had told him before she could not dance
She glanced at his humility and smiled
Her smile was very beautiful
It moved the man so that he forgot everything
No I wont dance she said softly
Her words came clean and ringing
Not knowing what he was doinghe often did the right thing by instincthe sat beside her inclining reverentially
But you mustnt miss your dance she reproved
Nay I dont want to dance thatits not one as I care about
Yet you invited me to it
He laughed very heartily at this
I never thought o that
Thart not long in taking the curl out of me
It was her turn to laugh quickly
You dont look as if youd come much uncurled she said
Im like a pigs tail I curl because I canna help it he laughed rather boisterously
And you are a miner
she exclaimed in surprise
Yes
I went down when I was ten
She looked at him in wondering dismay
When you were ten
And wasnt it very hard
she asked
You soon get used to it
You live like th mice an you pop out at night to see whats going on
It makes me feel blind she frowned
Like a moudiwarp
he laughed
Yi an theres some chaps as does go round like moudiwarps
He thrust his face forward in the blind snoutlike way of a mole seeming to sniff and peer for direction
They dun though
he protested naively
Tha niver seed such a way they get in
But tha mun let me tae thee down some time an tha can see for thysen
She looked at him startled
This was a new tract of life suddenly opened before her
She realised the life of the miners hundreds of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening
He seemed to her noble
He risked his life daily and with gaiety
She looked at him with a touch of appeal in her pure humility
Shouldnt ter like it
he asked tenderly
Appen not it ud dirty thee
She had never been theed and thoud before
The next Christmas they were married and for three months she was perfectly happy for six months she was very happy
He had signed the pledge and wore the blue ribbon of a teetotaller he was nothing if not showy
They lived she thought in his own house
It was small but convenient enough and quite nicely furnished with solid worthy stuff that suited her honest soul
The women her neighbours were rather foreign to her and Morels mother and sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike ways
But she could perfectly well live by herself so long as she had her husband close
Sometimes when she herself wearied of lovetalk she tried to open her heart seriously to him
She saw him listen deferentially but without understanding
This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy and she had flashes of fear
Sometimes he was restless of an evening it was not enough for him just to be near her she realised
She was glad when he set himself to little jobs
He was a remarkably handy mancould make or mend anything
So she would say I do like that coalrake of your mothersit is small and natty
Does ter my wench
Well I made that so I can make thee one 
What
why its a steel one
An what if it is
Tha slt hae one very similar if not exactly same
She did not mind the mess nor the hammering and noise
He was busy and happy
But in the seventh month when she was brushing his Sunday coat she felt papers in the breast pocket and seized with a sudden curiosity took them out to read
He very rarely wore the frockcoat he was married in and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the papers
They were the bills of the household furniture still unpaid
Look here she said at night after he was washed and had had his dinner
I found these in the pocket of your weddingcoat
Havent you settled the bills yet
No
I havent had a chance
But you told me all was paid
I had better go into Nottingham on Saturday and settle them
I dont like sitting on another mans chairs and eating from an unpaid table
He did not answer
I can have your bankbook cant I
Tha can hae it for what good itll be to thee
I thought she began
He had told her he had a good bit of money left over
But she realised it was no use asking questions
She sat rigid with bitterness and indignation
The next day she went down to see his mother
Didnt you buy the furniture for Walter
she asked
Yes I did tartly retorted the elder woman
And how much did he give you to pay for it
The elder woman was stung with fine indignation
Eighty pound if youre so keen on knowin she replied
Eighty pounds
But there are fortytwo pounds still owing
I cant help that
But where has it all gone
Youll find all the papers I think if you lookbeside ten pound as he owed me an six pound as the wedding cost down here
Six pounds
echoed Gertrude Morel
It seemed to her monstrous that after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding six pounds more should have been squandered in eating and drinking at Walters parents house at his expense
And how much has he sunk in his houses
she asked
His houseswhich houses
Gertrude Morel went white to the lips
He had told her the house he lived in and the next one was his own
I thought the house we live in she began
Theyre my houses those two said the motherinlaw
And not clear either
Its as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest paid
Gertrude sat white and silent
She was her father now
Then we ought to be paying you rent she said coldly
Walter is paying me rent replied the mother
And what rent
asked Gertrude
Six and six a week retorted the mother
It was more than the house was worth
Gertrude held her head erect looked straight before her
It is lucky to be you said the elder woman bitingly to have a husband as takes all the worry of the money and leaves you a free hand
The young wife was silent
She said very little to her husband but her manner had changed towards him
Something in her proud honourable soul had crystallised out hard as rock
When October came in she thought only of Christmas
Two years ago at Christmas she had met him
Last Christmas she had married him
This Christmas she would bear him a child
You dont dance yourself do you missis
asked her nearest neighbour in October when there was great talk of opening a dancingclass over the Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood
NoI never had the least inclination to Mrs Morel replied
Fancy
An how funny as you should ha married your Mester
You know hes quite a famous one for dancing
I didnt know he was famous laughed Mrs Morel
Yea he is though
Why he ran that dancingclass in the Miners Arms clubroom for over five year
Did he
Yes he did
The other woman was defiant
An it was thronged every Tuesday and Thursday an Satdayan there WAS carryinson accordin to all accounts
This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs Morel and she had a fair share of it
The women did not spare her at first for she was superior though she could not help it
He began to be rather late in coming home
Theyre working very late now arent they
she said to her washerwoman
No later than they allers do I dont think
But they stop to have their pint at Ellens an they get talkin an there you are
Dinner stone coldan it serves em right
But Mr Morel does not take any drink
The woman dropped the clothes looked at Mrs Morel then went on with her work saying nothing
Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born
Morel was good to her as good as gold
But she felt very lonely miles away from her own people
She felt lonely with him now and his presence only made it more intense
The boy was small and frail at first but he came on quickly
He was a beautiful child with dark gold ringlets and darkblue eyes which changed gradually to a clear grey
His mother loved him passionately
He came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear when her faith in life was shaken and her soul felt dreary and lonely
She made much of the child and the father was jealous
At last Mrs Morel despised her husband
She turned to the child she turned from the father
He had begun to neglect her the novelty of his own home was gone
He had no grit she said bitterly to herself
What he felt just at the minute that was all to him
He could not abide by anything
There was nothing at the back of all his show
There began a battle between the husband and wifea fearful bloody battle that ended only with the death of one
She fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities to make him fulfill his obligations
But he was too different from her
His nature was purely sensuous and she strove to make him moral religious
She tried to force him to face things
He could not endure itit drove him out of his mind
While the baby was still tiny the fathers temper had become so irritable that it was not to be trusted
The child had only to give a little trouble when the man began to bully
A little more and the hard hands of the collier hit the baby
Then Mrs Morel loathed her husband loathed him for days and he went out and drank and she cared very little what he did
Only on his return she scathed him with her satire
The estrangement between them caused him knowingly or unknowingly grossly to offend her where he would not have done
William was only one year old and his mother was proud of him he was so pretty
She was not well off now but her sisters kept the boy in clothes
Then with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather and his white coat he was a joy to her the twining wisps of hair clustering round his head
Mrs Morel lay listening one Sunday morning to the chatter of the father and child downstairs
Then she dozed off
When she came downstairs a great fire glowed in the grate the room was hot the breakfast was roughly laid and seated in his armchair against the chimneypiece sat Morel rather timid and standing between his legs the childcropped like a sheep with such an odd round polllooking wondering at her and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug a myriad of crescentshaped curls like the petals of a marigold scattered in the reddening firelight
Mrs Morel stood still
It was her first baby
She went very white and was unable to speak
What dost think o im
Morel laughed uneasily
She gripped her two fists lifted them and came forward
Morel shrank back
I could kill you I could
she said
She choked with rage her two fists uplifted
Yer non want ter make a wench on im Morel said in a frightened tone bending his head to shield his eyes from hers
His attempt at laughter had vanished
The mother looked down at the jagged closeclipped head of her child
She put her hands on his hair and stroked and fondled his head
Ohmy boy
she faltered
Her lip trembled her face broke and snatching up the child she buried her face in his shoulder and cried painfully
She was one of those women who cannot cry whom it hurts as it hurts a man
It was like ripping something out of her her sobbing
Morel sat with his elbows on his knees his hands gripped together till the knuckles were white
He gazed in the fire feeling almost stunned as if he could not breathe
Presently she came to an end soothed the child and cleared away the breakfasttable
She left the newspaper littered with curls spread upon the hearthrug
At last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back of the fire
She went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet
Morel was subdued
He crept about wretchedly and his meals were a misery that day
She spoke to him civilly and never alluded to what he had done
But he felt something final had happened
Afterwards she said she had been silly that the boys hair would have had to be cut sooner or later
In the end she even brought herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did
But she knew and Morel knew that that act had caused something momentous to take place in her soul
She remembered the scene all her life as one in which she had suffered the most intensely
This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her love for Morel
Before while she had striven against him bitterly she had fretted after him as if he had gone astray from her
Now she ceased to fret for his love he was an outsider to her
This made life much more bearable
Nevertheless she still continued to strive with him
She still had her high moral sense inherited from generations of Puritans
It was now a religious instinct and she was almost a fanatic with him because she loved him or had loved him
If he sinned she tortured him
If he drank and lied was often a poltroon sometimes a knave she wielded the lash unmercifully
The pity was she was too much his opposite
She could not be content with the little he might be she would have him the much that he ought to be
So in seeking to make him nobler than he could be she destroyed him
She injured and hurt and scarred herself but she lost none of her worth
She also had the children
He drank rather heavily though not more than many miners and always beer so that whilst his health was affected it was never injured
The weekend was his chief carouse
He sat in the Miners Arms until turningout time every Friday every Saturday and every Sunday evening
On Monday and Tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten oclock
Sometimes he stayed at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings or was only out for an hour
He practically never had to miss work owing to his drinking
But although he was very steady at work his wages fell off
He was blabmouthed a tonguewagger
Authority was hateful to him therefore he could only abuse the pitmanagers
He would say in the Palmerston Th gaffer come down to our stall this morning an e says You know Walter this erell not do
What about these props
An I says to him Why what art talkin about
What dst mean about th props
Itll never do this ere e says
Youll be havin th roof in one o these days
An I says Thad better stan on a bit o clunch then an hold it up wi thy ead
So e wor that mad e cossed an e swore an tother chaps they did laugh
Morel was a good mimic
He imitated the managers fat squeaky voice with its attempt at good English
I shant have it Walter
Who knows more about it me or you
So I says Ive niver fun out how much tha knows Alfred
Itll appen carry thee ter bed an back
So Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions
And some of this would be true
The pitmanager was not an educated man
He had been a boy along with Morel so that while the two disliked each other they more or less took each other for granted
But Alfred Charlesworth did not forgive the butty these publichouse sayings
Consequently although Morel was a good miner sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he married he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls where the coal was thin and hard to get and unprofitable
Also in summer the pits are slack
Often on bright sunny mornings the men are seen trooping home again at ten eleven or twelve oclock
No empty trucks stand at the pitmouth
The women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence and count the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley
And the children as they come from school at dinnertime looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing say Mintons knocked off
My dadll be at home
And there is a sort of shadow over all women and children and men because money will be short at the end of the week
Morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week to provide everythingrent food clothes clubs insurance doctors
Occasionally if he were flush he gave her thirtyfive
But these occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twentyfive
In winter with a decent stall the miner might earn fifty or fiftyfive shillings a week
Then he was happy
On Friday night Saturday and Sunday he spent royally getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts
And out of so much he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples
It all went in drink
In the bad times matters were more worrying but he was not so often drunk so that Mrs Morel used to say Im not sure I wouldnt rather be short for when hes flush there isnt a minute of peace
If he earned forty shillings he kept ten from thirtyfive he kept five from thirtytwo he kept four from twentyeight he kept three from twentyfour he kept two from twenty he kept oneandsix from eighteen he kept a shilling from sixteen he kept sixpence
He never saved a penny and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving instead she had occasionally to pay his debts not publichouse debts for those never were passed on to the women but debts when he had bought a canary or a fancy walkingstick
At the wakes time Morel was working badly and Mrs Morel was trying to save against her confinement
So it galled her bitterly to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money whilst she remained at home harassed
There were two days holiday
On the Tuesday morning Morel rose early
He was in good spirits
Quite early before six oclock she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs
He had a pleasant way of whistling lively and musical
He nearly always whistled hymns
He had been a choirboy with a beautiful voice and had taken solos in Southwell cathedral
His morning whistling alone betrayed it
His wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden his whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away
It always gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed the children not yet awake in the bright early morning happy in his mans fashion
At nine oclock while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting playing on the sofa and the mother was washing up he came in from his carpentry his sleeves rolled up his waistcoat hanging open
He was still a goodlooking man with black wavy hair and a large black moustache
His face was perhaps too much inflamed and there was about him a look almost of peevishness
But now he was jolly
He went straight to the sink where his wife was washing up
What are thee there
he said boisterously
Sluthe off an let me wesh mysen
You may wait till Ive finished said his wife
Oh mun I
An what if I shonna
This goodhumoured threat amused Mrs Morel
Then you can go and wash yourself in the softwater tub
Ha
I can an a tha mucky little ussy
With which he stood watching her a moment then went away to wait for her
When he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant
Usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck
Now however he made a toilet
There seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen and bending because it was too low for him scrupulously parted his wet black hair that it irritated Mrs Morel
He put on a turndown collar a black bow and wore his Sunday tailcoat
As such he looked spruce and what his clothes would not do his instinct for making the most of his good looks would
At halfpast nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal
Jerry was Morels bosom friend and Mrs Morel disliked him
He was a tall thin man with a rather foxy face the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes
He walked with a stiff brittle dignity as if his head were on a wooden spring
His nature was cold and shrewd
Generous where he intended to be generous he seemed to be very fond of Morel and more or less to take charge of him
Mrs Morel hated him
She had known his wife who had died of consumption and who had at the end conceived such a violent dislike of her husband that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage
None of which Jerry had seemed to mind
And now his eldest daughter a girl of fifteen kept a poor house for him and looked after the two younger children
A mean wizzenhearted stick
Mrs Morel said of him
Ive never known Jerry mean in MY life protested Morel
A openerhanded and more freer chap you couldnt find anywhere accordin to my knowledge
Openhanded to you retorted Mrs Morel
But his fist is shut tight enough to his children poor things
Poor things
And what for are they poor things I should like to know
But Mrs Morel would not be appeased on Jerrys score
The subject of argument was seen craning his thin neck over the scullery curtain
He caught Mrs Morels eye
Mornin missis
Mester in
Yeshe is
Jerry entered unasked and stood by the kitchen doorway
He was not invited to sit down but stood there coolly asserting the rights of men and husbands
A nice day he said to Mrs Morel
Yes
Grand out this morninggrand for a walk
Do you mean YOURE going for a walk
she asked
Yes
We mean walkin to Nottingham he replied
Hm
The two men greeted each other both glad Jerry however full of assurance Morel rather subdued afraid to seem too jubilant in presence of his wife
But he laced his boots quickly with spirit
They were going for a tenmile walk across the fields to Nottingham
Climbing the hillside from the Bottoms they mounted gaily into the morning
At the Moon and Stars they had their first drink then on to the Old Spot
Then a long five miles of drought to carry them into Bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter
But they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full so that when they came in sight of the city Morel was sleepy
The town spread upwards before them smoking vaguely in the midday glare fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys
In the last field Morel lay down under an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour
When he rose to go forward he felt queer
The two had dinner in the Meadows with Jerrys sister then repaired to the Punch Bowl where they mixed in the excitement of pigeonracing
Morel never in his life played cards considering them as having some occult malevolent powerthe devils pictures he called them
But he was a master of skittles and of dominoes
He took a challenge from a Newark man on skittles
All the men in the old long bar took sides betting either one way or the other
Morel took off his coat
Jerry held the hat containing the money
The men at the tables watched
Some stood with their mugs in their hands
Morel felt his big wooden ball carefully then launched it
He played havoc among the ninepins and won half a crown which restored him to solvency
By seven oclock the two were in good condition
They caught the 730 train home
In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable
Every inhabitant remaining was out of doors
The women in twos and threes bareheaded and in white aprons gossiped in the alley between the blocks
Men having a rest between drinks sat on their heels and talked
The place smelled stale the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat
Mrs Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows which were not more than two hundred yards away
The water ran quickly over stones and broken pots
Mother and child leaned on the rail of the old sheepbridge watching
Up at the dippinghole at the other end of the meadow Mrs Morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant meadow
She knew William was at the dippinghole and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned
Annie played under the tall old hedge picking up alder cones that she called currants
The child required much attention and the flies were teasing
The children were put to bed at seven oclock
Then she worked awhile
When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a load off their minds a railway journey no longer impended so they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day
They entered the Nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers
The next day was a workday and the thought of it put a damper on the mens spirits
Most of them moreover had spent their money
Some were already rolling dismally home to sleep in preparation for the morrow
Mrs Morel listening to their mournful singing went indoors
Nine oclock passed and ten and still the pair had not returned
On a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly in a drawl Lead kindly Light
Mrs Morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when they got maudlin
As if Genevieve werent good enough she said
The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops
On the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly
Mrs Morel took a panchion a great bowl of thick red earth streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom and then straining herself to the weight was pouring in the liquor
Just then Morel came in
He had been very jolly in the Nelson but coming home had grown irritable
He had not quite got over the feeling of irritability and pain after having slept on the ground when he was so hot and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house
He did not know he was angry
But when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open it he kicked it and broke the latch
He entered just as Mrs Morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan
Swaying slightly he lurched against the table
The boiling liquor pitched
Mrs Morel started back
Good gracious she cried coming home in his drunkenness
Comin home in his what
he snarled his hat over his eye
Suddenly her blood rose in a jet
Say youre NOT drunk
she flashed
She had put down her saucepan and was stirring the sugar into the beer
He dropped his two hands heavily on the table and thrust his face forwards at her
Say youre not drunk he repeated
Why nobody but a nasty little bitch like you ud ave such a thought
He thrust his face forward at her
Theres money to bezzle with if theres money for nothing else
Ive not spent a twoshillin bit this day he said
You dont get as drunk as a lord on nothing she replied
And she cried flashing into sudden fury if youve been sponging on your beloved Jerry why let him look after his children for they need it
Its a lie its a lie
Shut your face woman
They were now at battlepitch
Each forgot everything save the hatred of the other and the battle between them
She was fiery and furious as he
They went on till he called her a liar
No she cried starting up scarce able to breathe
Dont call me thatyou the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoeleather
She forced the last words out of suffocated lungs
Youre a liar
he yelled banging the table with his fist
Youre a liar youre a liar
She stiffened herself with clenched fists
The house is filthy with you she cried
Then get out on itits mine
Get out on it
he shouted
Its me as brings th money whoam not thee
Its my house not thine
Then ger out ontger out ont
And I would she cried suddenly shaken into tears of impotence
Ah wouldnt I wouldnt I have gone long ago but for those children
Ay havent I repented not going years ago when Id only the onesuddenly drying into rage
Do you think its for YOU I stopdo you think Id stop one minute for YOU
Go then he shouted beside himself
Go
No
She faced round
No she cried loudly you shant have it ALL your own way you shant do ALL you like
Ive got those children to see to
My word she laughed I should look well to leave them to you
Go he cried thickly lifting his fist
He was afraid of her
Go
I should be only too glad
I should laugh laugh my lord if I could get away from you she replied
He came up to her his red face with its bloodshot eyes thrust forward and gripped her arms
She cried in fear of him struggled to be free
Coming slightly to himself panting he pushed her roughly to the outer door and thrust her forth slotting the bolt behind her with a bang
Then he went back into the kitchen dropped into his armchair his head bursting full of blood sinking between his knees
Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor from exhaustion and intoxication
The moon was high and magnificent in the August night
Mrs Morel seared with passion shivered to find herself out there in a great white light that fell cold on her and gave a shock to her inflamed soul
She stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door
Then she got the air into her breast
She walked down the garden path trembling in every limb while the child boiled within her
For a while she could not control her consciousness mechanically she went over the last scene then over it again certain phrases certain moments coming each time like a brand redhot down on her soul and each time she enacted again the past hour each time the brand came down at the same points till the mark was burnt in and the pain burnt out and at last she came to herself
She must have been half an hour in this delirious condition
Then the presence of the night came again to her
She glanced round in fear
She had wandered to the side garden where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant bushes under the long wall
The garden was a narrow strip bounded from the road that cut transversely between the blocks by a thick thorn hedge
She hurried out of the side garden to the front where she could stand as if in an immense gulf of white light the moon streaming high in face of her the moonlight standing up from the hills in front and filling the valley where the Bottoms crouched almost blindingly
There panting and half weeping in reaction from the stress she murmured to herself over and over again The nuisance
the nuisance
She became aware of something about her
With an effort she roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness
The tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight and the air was charged with their perfume as with a presence
Mrs Morel gasped slightly in fear
She touched the big pallid flowers on their petals then shivered
They seemed to be stretching in the moonlight
She put her hand into one white bin the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight
She bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen but it only appeared dusky
Then she drank a deep draught of the scent
It almost made her dizzy
Mrs Morel leaned on the garden gate looking out and she lost herself awhile
She did not know what she thought
Except for a slight feeling of sickness and her consciousness in the child herself melted out like scent into the shiny pale air
After a time the child too melted with her in the mixingpot of moonlight and she rested with the hills and lilies and houses all swum together in a kind of swoon
When she came to herself she was tired for sleep
Languidly she looked about her the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen a moth ricochetted over them and right across the garden
Following it with her eye roused her
A few whiffs of the raw strong scent of phlox invigorated her
She passed along the path hesitating at the white rosebush
It smelled sweet and simple
She touched the white ruffles of the roses
Their fresh scent and cool soft leaves reminded her of the morningtime and sunshine
She was very fond of them
But she was tired and wanted to sleep
In the mysterious outofdoors she felt forlorn
There was no noise anywhere
Evidently the children had not been wakened or had gone to sleep again
A train three miles away roared across the valley
The night was very large and very strange stretching its hoary distances infinitely
And out of the silvergrey fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse a corncrake not far off sound of a train like a sigh and distant shouts of men
Her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again she hurried down the side garden to the back of the house
Softly she lifted the latch the door was still bolted and hard against her
She rapped gently waited then rapped again
She must not rouse the children nor the neighbours
He must be asleep and he would not wake easily
Her heart began to burn to be indoors
She clung to the doorhandle
Now it was cold she would take a chill and in her present condition
Putting her apron over her head and her arms she hurried again to the side garden to the window of the kitchen
Leaning on the sill she could just see under the blind her husbands arms spread out on the table and his black head on the board
He was sleeping with his face lying on the table
Something in his attitude made her feel tired of things
The lamp was burning smokily she could tell by the copper colour of the light
She tapped at the window more and more noisily
Almost it seemed as if the glass would break
Still he did not wake up
After vain efforts she began to shiver partly from contact with the stone and from exhaustion
Fearful always for the unborn child she wondered what she could do for warmth
She went down to the coalhouse where there was an old hearthrug she had carried out for the ragman the day before
This she wrapped over her shoulders
It was warm if grimy
Then she walked up and down the garden path peeping every now and then under the blind knocking and telling herself that in the end the very strain of his position must wake him
At last after about an hour she rapped long and low at the window
Gradually the sound penetrated to him
When in despair she had ceased to tap she saw him stir then lift his face blindly
The labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness
She rapped imperatively at the window
He started awake
Instantly she saw his fists set and his eyes glare
He had not a grain of physical fear
If it had been twenty burglars he would have gone blindly for them
He glared round bewildered but prepared to fight
Open the door Walter she said coldly
His hands relaxed
It dawned on him what he had done
His head dropped sullen and dogged
She saw him hurry to the door heard the bolt chock
He tried the latch
It openedand there stood the silvergrey night fearful to him after the tawny light of the lamp
He hurried back
When Mrs Morel entered she saw him almost running through the door to the stairs
He had ripped his collar off his neck in his haste to be gone ere she came in and there it lay with bursten buttonholes
It made her angry
She warmed and soothed herself
In her weariness forgetting everything she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done set his breakfast rinsed his pitbottle put his pitclothes on the hearth to warm set his pitboots beside them put him out a clean scarf and snapbag and two apples raked the fire and went to bed
He was already dead asleep
His narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks downstrokes and his sulky mouth seemed to be saying I dont care who you are nor what you are I SHALL have my own way
Mrs Morel knew him too well to look at him
As she unfastened her brooch at the mirror she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared with the yellow dust of lilies
She brushed it off and at last lay down
For some time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks but she was asleep before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his drunkenness
CHAPTER II THE BIRTH OF PAUL AND ANOTHER BATTLE AFTER such a scene as the last Walter Morel was for some days abashed and ashamed but he soon regained his old bullying indifference
Yet there was a slight shrinking a diminishing in his assurance
Physically even he shrank and his fine full presence waned
He never grew in the least stout so that as he sank from his erect assertive bearing his physique seemed to contract along with his pride and moral strength
But now he realised how hard it was for his wife to drag about at her work and his sympathy quickened by penitence hastened forward with his help
He came straight home from the pit and stayed in at evening till Friday and then he could not remain at home
But he was back again by ten oclock almost quite sober
He always made his own breakfast
Being a man who rose early and had plenty of time he did not as some miners do drag his wife out of bed at six oclock
At five sometimes earlier he woke got straight out of bed and went downstairs
When she could not sleep his wife lay waiting for this time as for a period of peace
The only real rest seemed to be when he was out of the house
He went downstairs in his shirt and then struggled into his pittrousers which were left on the hearth to warm all night
There was always a fire because Mrs Morel raked
And the first sound in the house was the bang bang of the poker against the raker as Morel smashed the remainder of the coal to make the kettle which was filled and left on the hob finally boil
His cup and knife and fork all he wanted except just the food was laid ready on the table on a newspaper
Then he got his breakfast made the tea packed the bottom of the doors with rugs to shut out the draught piled a big fire and sat down to an hour of joy
He toasted his bacon on a fork and caught the drops of fat on his bread then he put the rasher on his thick slice of bread and cut off chunks with a claspknife poured his tea into his saucer and was happy
With his family about meals were never so pleasant
He loathed a fork it is a modern introduction which has still scarcely reached common people
What Morel preferred was a claspknife
Then in solitude he ate and drank often sitting in cold weather on a little stool with his back to the warm chimneypiece his food on the fender his cup on the hearth
And then he read the last nights newspaperwhat of it he couldspelling it over laboriously
He preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even when it was daylight it was the habit of the mine
At a quarter to six he rose cut two thick slices of bread and butter and put them in the white calico snapbag
He filled his tin bottle with tea
Cold tea without milk or sugar was the drink he preferred for the pit
Then he pulled off his shirt and put on his pitsinglet a vest of thick flannel cut low round the neck and with short sleeves like a chemise
Then he went upstairs to his wife with a cup of tea because she was ill and because it occurred to him
Ive brought thee a cup o tea lass he said
Well you neednt for you know I dont like it she replied
Drink it up itll pop thee off to sleep again
She accepted the tea
It pleased him to see her take it and sip it
Ill back my life theres no sugar in she said
Yitheres one big un he replied injured
Its a wonder she said sipping again
She had a winsome face when her hair was loose
He loved her to grumble at him in this manner
He looked at her again and went without any sort of leavetaking
He never took more than two slices of bread and butter to eat in the pit so an apple or an orange was a treat to him
He always liked it when she put one out for him
He tied a scarf round his neck put on his great heavy boots his coat with the big pocket that carried his snapbag and his bottle of tea and went forth into the fresh morning air closing without locking the door behind him
He loved the early morning and the walk across the fields
So he appeared at the pittop often with a stalk from the hedge between his teeth which he chewed all day to keep his mouth moist down the mine feeling quite as happy as when he was in the field
Later when the time for the baby grew nearer he would bustle round in his slovenly fashion poking out the ashes rubbing the fireplace sweeping the house before he went to work
Then feeling very selfrighteous he went upstairs
Now Im cleaned up for thee thas no casions ter stir a peg all day but sit and read thy books
Which made her laugh in spite of her indignation
And the dinner cooks itself
she answered
Eh I know nowt about th dinner
Youd know if there werent any
Ay appen so he answered departing
When she got downstairs she would find the house tidy but dirty
She could not rest until she had thoroughly cleaned so she went down to the ashpit with her dustpan
Mrs Kirk spying her would contrive to have to go to her own coalplace at that minute
Then across the wooden fence she would call So you keep wagging on then
Ay answered Mrs Morel deprecatingly
Theres nothing else for it
Have you seen Hose
called a very small woman from across the road
It was Mrs Anthony a blackhaired strange little body who always wore a brown velvet dress tight fitting
I havent said Mrs Morel
Eh I wish hed come
Ive got a copperful of clothes an Im sure I heered his bell
Hark
Hes at the end
The two women looked down the alley
At the end of the Bottoms a man stood in a sort of oldfashioned trap bending over bundles of creamcoloured stuff while a cluster of women held up their arms to him some with bundles
Mrs Anthony herself had a heap of creamy undyed stockings hanging over her arm
Ive done ten dozen this week she said proudly to Mrs Morel
Ttt
went the other
I dont know how you can find time
Eh
said Mrs Anthony
You can find time if you make time
I dont know how you do it said Mrs Morel
And how much shall you get for those many
Tuppencehapenny a dozen replied the other
Well said Mrs Morel
Id starve before Id sit down and seam twentyfour stockings for twopence hapenny
Oh I dont know said Mrs Anthony
You can rip along with em
Hose was coming along ringing his bell
Women were waiting at the yardends with their seamed stockings hanging over their arms
The man a common fellow made jokes with them tried to swindle them and bullied them
Mrs Morel went up her yard disdainfully
It was an understood thing that if one woman wanted her neighbour she should put the poker in the fire and bang at the back of the fireplace which as the fires were back to back would make a great noise in the adjoining house
One morning Mrs Kirk mixing a pudding nearly started out of her skin as she heard the thud thud in her grate
With her hands all floury she rushed to the fence
Did you knock Mrs
Morel
If you wouldnt mind Mrs
Kirk
Mrs Kirk climbed on to her copper got over the wall on to Mrs Morels copper and ran in to her neighbour
Eh dear how are you feeling
she cried in concern
You might fetch Mrs Bower said Mrs Morel
Mrs Kirk went into the yard lifted up her strong shrill voice and called AggieAggie
The sound was heard from one end of the Bottoms to the other
At last Aggie came running up and was sent for Mrs Bower whilst Mrs Kirk left her pudding and stayed with her neighbour
Mrs Morel went to bed
Mrs Kirk had Annie and William for dinner
Mrs Bower fat and waddling bossed the house
Hash some cold meat up for the masters dinner and make him an applecharlotte pudding said Mrs Morel
He may go without pudding this day said Mrs Bower
Morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottom of the pit ready to come up
Some men were there before four oclock when the whistle blew looseall but Morel whose stall a poor one was at this time about a mile and a half away from the bottom worked usually till the first mate stopped then he finished also
This day however the miner was sick of the work
At two oclock he looked at his watch by the light of the green candlehe was in a safe workingand again at halfpast two
He was hewing at a piece of rock that was in the way for the next days work
As he sat on his heels or kneeled giving hard blows with his pick Uszzauszza
he went
Shall ter finish Sorry
cried Barker his fellow butty
Finish
Niver while the world stands
growled Morel
And he went on striking
He was tired
Its a heartbreaking job said Barker
But Morel was too exasperated at the end of his tether to answer
Still he struck and hacked with all his might
Tha might as well leave it Walter said Barker
Itll do tomorrow without thee hackin thy guts out
Ill lay no b finger on this tomorrow Isrel
cried Morel
Oh well if tha wunna somebody elsell hae to said Israel
Then Morel continued to strike
Heyup thereLOOSEA
cried the men leaving the next stall
Morel continued to strike
Thall happen catch me up said Barker departing
When he had gone Morel left alone felt savage
He had not finished his job
He had overworked himself into a frenzy
Rising wet with sweat he threw his tool down pulled on his coat blew out his candle took his lamp and went
Down the main road the lights of the other men went swinging
There was a hollow sound of many voices
It was a long heavy tramp underground
He sat at the bottom of the pit where the great drops of water fell plash
Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up talking noisily
Morel gave his answers short and disagreeable
Its rainin Sorry said old Giles who had had the news from the top
Morel found one comfort
He had his old umbrella which he loved in the lamp cabin
At last he took his stand on the chair and was at the top in a moment
Then he handed in his lamp and got his umbrella which he had bought at an auction for oneandsix
He stood on the edge of the pitbank for a moment looking out over the fields grey rain was falling
The trucks stood full of wet bright coal
Water ran down the sides of the waggons over the white CW
and Co
Colliers walking indifferent to the rain were streaming down the line and up the field a grey dismal host
Morel put up his umbrella and took pleasure from the peppering of the drops thereon
All along the road to Bestwood the miners tramped wet and grey and dirty but their red mouths talking with animation
Morel also walked with a gang but he said nothing
He frowned peevishly as he went
Many men passed into the Prince of Wales or into Ellens
Morel feeling sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation trudged along under the dripping trees that overhung the park wall and down the mud of Greenhill Lane
Mrs Morel lay in bed listening to the rain and the feet of the colliers from Minton their voices and the bang bang of the gates as they went through the stile up the field
Theres some herb beer behind the pantry door she said
Th masterll want a drink if he doesnt stop
But he was late so she concluded he had called for a drink since it was raining
What did he care about the child or her
She was very ill when her children were born
What is it
she asked feeling sick to death
A boy
And she took consolation in that
The thought of being the mother of men was warming to her heart
She looked at the child
It had blue eyes and a lot of fair hair and was bonny
Her love came up hot in spite of everything
She had it in bed with her
Morel thinking nothing dragged his way up the garden path wearily and angrily
He closed his umbrella and stood it in the sink then he sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen
Mrs Bower appeared in the inner doorway
Well she said shes about as bad as she can be
Its a boy childt
The miner grunted put his empty snapbag and his tin bottle on the dresser went back into the scullery and hung up his coat then came and dropped into his chair
Han yer got a drink
he asked
The woman went into the pantry
There was heard the pop of a cork
She set the mug with a little disgusted rap on the table before Morel
He drank gasped wiped his big moustache on the end of his scarf drank gasped and lay back in his chair
The woman would not speak to him again
She set his dinner before him and went upstairs
Was that the master
asked Mrs Morel
Ive gave him his dinner replied Mrs Bower
After he had sat with his arms on the tablehe resented the fact that Mrs Bower put no cloth on for him and gave him a little plate instead of a fullsized dinnerplatehe began to eat
The fact that his wife was ill that he had another boy was nothing to him at that moment
He was too tired he wanted his dinner he wanted to sit with his arms lying on the board he did not like having Mrs Bower about
The fire was too small to please him
After he had finished his meal he sat for twenty minutes then he stoked up a big fire
Then in his stockinged feet he went reluctantly upstairs
It was a struggle to face his wife at this moment and he was tired
His face was black and smeared with sweat
His singlet had dried again soaking the dirt in
He had a dirty woollen scarf round his throat
So he stood at the foot of the bed
Well how are ter then
he asked
I sll be all right she answered
Hm
He stood at a loss what to say next
He was tired and this bother was rather a nuisance to him and he didnt quite know where he was
A lad tha says he stammered
She turned down the sheet and showed the child
Bless him
he murmured
Which made her laugh because he blessed by rotepretending paternal emotion which he did not feel just then
Go now she said
I will my lass he answered turning away
Dismissed he wanted to kiss her but he dared not
She half wanted him to kiss her but could not bring herself to give any sign
She only breathed freely when he was gone out of the room again leaving behind him a faint smell of pitdirt
Mrs Morel had a visit every day from the Congregational clergyman
Mr Heaton was young and very poor
His wife had died at the birth of his first baby so he remained alone in the manse
He was a Bachelor of Arts of Cambridge very shy and no preacher
Mrs Morel was fond of him and he depended on her
For hours he talked to her when she was well
He became the godparent of the child
Occasionally the minister stayed to tea with Mrs Morel
Then she laid the cloth early got out her best cups with a little green rim and hoped Morel would not come too soon indeed if he stayed for a pint she would not mind this day
She had always two dinners to cook because she believed children should have their chief meal at midday whereas Morel needed his at five oclock
So Mr Heaton would hold the baby whilst Mrs Morel beat up a batterpudding or peeled the potatoes and he watching her all the time would discuss his next sermon
His ideas were quaint and fantastic
She brought him judiciously to earth
It was a discussion of the wedding at Cana
When He changed the water into wine at Cana he said that is a symbol that the ordinary life even the blood of the married husband and wife which had before been uninspired like water became filled with the Spirit and was as wine because when love enters the whole spiritual constitution of a man changes is filled with the Holy Ghost and almost his form is altered
Mrs Morel thought to herself Yes poor fellow his young wife is dead that is why he makes his love into the Holy Ghost
They were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heard the sluther of pitboots
Good gracious
exclaimed Mrs Morel in spite of herself
The minister looked rather scared
Morel entered
He was feeling rather savage
He nodded a How dyer do to the clergyman who rose to shake hands with him
Nay said Morel showing his hand look thee at it
Tha niver wants ter shake hands wi a hand like that does ter
Theres too much pickhaft and shoveldirt on it
The minister flushed with confusion and sat down again
Mrs Morel rose carried out the steaming saucepan
Morel took off his coat dragged his armchair to table and sat down heavily
Are you tired
asked the clergyman
Tired
I ham that replied Morel
YOU dont know what it is to be tired as IM tired
No replied the clergyman
Why look yer ere said the miner showing the shoulders of his singlet
Its a bit dry now but its wet as a clout with sweat even yet
Feel it
Goodness
cried Mrs Morel
Mr Heaton doesnt want to feel your nasty singlet
The clergyman put out his hand gingerly
No perhaps he doesnt said Morel but its all come out of me whether or not
An ivry day alike my singlets wringin wet
Avent you got a drink Missis for a man when he comes home barkled up from the pit
You know you drank all the beer said Mrs Morel pouring out his tea
An was there no more to be got
Turning to the clergymanA man gets that caked up wi th dust you knowthat clogged up down a coalmine he NEEDS a drink when he comes home
I am sure he does said the clergyman
But its ten to one if theres owt for him
Theres waterand theres tea said Mrs Morel
Water
Its not water asll clear his throat
He poured out a saucerful of tea blew it and sucked it up through his great black moustache sighing afterwards
Then he poured out another saucerful and stood his cup on the table
My cloth
said Mrs Morel putting it on a plate
A man as comes home as I do s too tired to care about cloths said Morel
Pity
exclaimed his wife sarcastically
The room was full of the smell of meat and vegetables and pitclothes
He leaned over to the minister his great moustache thrust forward his mouth very red in his black face
Mr Heaton he said a man as has been down the black hole all day dingin away at a coalface yi a sight harder than that wall Neednt make a moan of it put in Mrs Morel
She hated her husband because whenever he had an audience he whined and played for sympathy
William sitting nursing the baby hated him with a boys hatred for false sentiment and for the stupid treatment of his mother
Annie had never liked him she merely avoided him
When the minister had gone Mrs Morel looked at her cloth
A fine mess
she said
Dost think Im goin to sit wi my arms danglin cos thas got a parson for tea wi thee
he bawled
They were both angry but she said nothing
The baby began to cry and Mrs Morel picking up a saucepan from the hearth accidentally knocked Annie on the head whereupon the girl began to whine and Morel to shout at her
In the midst of this pandemonium William looked up at the big glazed text over the mantelpiece and read distinctly God Bless Our Home
Whereupon Mrs Morel trying to soothe the baby jumped up rushed at him boxed his ears saying What are YOU putting in for
And then she sat down and laughed till tears ran over her cheeks while William kicked the stool he had been sitting on and Morel growled I canna see what there is so much to laugh at
One evening directly after the parsons visit feeling unable to bear herself after another display from her husband she took Annie and the baby and went out
Morel had kicked William and the mother would never forgive him
She went over the sheepbridge and across a corner of the meadow to the cricketground
The meadows seemed one space of ripe evening light whispering with the distant millrace
She sat on a seat under the alders in the cricketground and fronted the evening
Before her level and solid spread the big green cricketfield like the bed of a sea of light
Children played in the bluish shadow of the pavilion
Many rooks high up came cawing home across the softlywoven sky
They stooped in a long curve down into the golden glow concentrating cawing wheeling like black flakes on a slow vortex over a tree clump that made a dark boss among the pasture
A few gentlemen were practising and Mrs Morel could hear the chock of the ball and the voices of men suddenly roused could see the white forms of men shifting silently over the green upon which already the under shadows were smouldering
Away at the grange one side of the haystacks was lit up the other sides bluegrey
A waggon of sheaves rocked small across the melting yellow light
The sun was going down
Every open evening the hills of Derbyshire were blazed over with red sunset
Mrs Morel watched the sun sink from the glistening sky leaving a soft flowerblue overhead while the western space went red as if all the fire had swum down there leaving the bell cast flawless blue
The mountainash berries across the field stood fierily out from the dark leaves for a moment
A few shocks of corn in a corner of the fallow stood up as if alive she imagined them bowing perhaps her son would be a Joseph
In the east a mirrored sunset floated pink opposite the wests scarlet
The big haystacks on the hillside that butted into the glare went cold
With Mrs Morel it was one of those still moments when the small frets vanish and the beauty of things stands out and she had the peace and the strength to see herself
Now and again a swallow cut close to her
Now and again Annie came up with a handful of aldercurrants
The baby was restless on his mothers knee clambering with his hands at the light
Mrs Morel looked down at him
She had dreaded this baby like a catastrophe because of her feeling for her husband
And now she felt strangely towards the infant
Her heart was heavy because of the child almost as if it were unhealthy or malformed
Yet it seemed quite well
But she noticed the peculiar knitting of the babys brows and the peculiar heaviness of its eyes as if it were trying to understand something that was pain
She felt when she looked at her childs dark brooding pupils as if a burden were on her heart
He looks as if he was thinking about somethingquite sorrowful said Mrs Kirk
Suddenly looking at him the heavy feeling at the mothers heart melted into passionate grief
She bowed over him and a few tears shook swiftly out of her very heart
The baby lifted his fingers
My lamb
she cried softly
And at that moment she felt in some far inner place of her soul that she and her husband were guilty
The baby was looking up at her
It had blue eyes like her own but its look was heavy steady as if it had realised something that had stunned some point of its soul
In her arms lay the delicate baby
Its deep blue eyes always looking up at her unblinking seemed to draw her innermost thoughts out of her
She no longer loved her husband she had not wanted this child to come and there it lay in her arms and pulled at her heart
She felt as if the navel string that had connected its frail little body with hers had not been broken
A wave of hot love went over her to the infant
She held it close to her face and breast
With all her force with all her soul she would make up to it for having brought it into the world unloved
She would love it all the more now it was here carry it in her love
Its clear knowing eyes gave her pain and fear
Did it know all about her
When it lay under her heart had it been listening then
Was there a reproach in the look
She felt the marrow melt in her bones with fear and pain
Once more she was aware of the sun lying red on the rim of the hill opposite
She suddenly held up the child in her hands
Look
she said
Look my pretty
She thrust the infant forward to the crimson throbbing sun almost with relief
She saw him lift his little fist
Then she put him to her bosom again ashamed almost of her impulse to give him back again whence he came
If he lives she thought to herself what will become of himwhat will he be
Her heart was anxious
I will call him Paul she said suddenly she knew not why
After a while she went home
A fine shadow was flung over the deep green meadow darkening all
As she expected she found the house empty
But Morel was home by ten oclock and that day at least ended peacefully
Walter Morel was at this time exceedingly irritable
His work seemed to exhaust him
When he came home he did not speak civilly to anybody
If the fire were rather low he bullied about that he grumbled about his dinner if the children made a chatter he shouted at them in a way that made their mothers blood boil and made them hate him
On the Friday he was not home by eleven oclock
The baby was unwell and was restless crying if he were put down
Mrs Morel tired to death and still weak was scarcely under control
I wish the nuisance would come she said wearily to herself
The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms
She was too tired to carry him to the cradle
But Ill say nothing whatever time he comes she said
It only works me up I wont say anything
But I know if he does anything itll make my blood boil she added to herself
She sighed hearing him coming as if it were something she could not bear
He taking his revenge was nearly drunk
She kept her head bent over the child as he entered not wishing to see him
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when in passing he lurched against the dresser setting the tins rattling and clutched at the white pot knobs for support
He hung up his hat and coat then returned stood glowering from a distance at her as she sat bowed over the child
Is there nothing to eat in the house
he asked insolently as if to a servant
In certain stages of his intoxication he affected the clipped mincing speech of the towns
Mrs Morel hated him most in this condition
You know what there is in the house she said so coldly it sounded impersonal
He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle
I asked a civil question and I expect a civil answer he said affectedly
And you got it she said still ignoring him
He glowered again
Then he came unsteadily forward
He leaned on the table with one hand and with the other jerked at the table drawer to get a knife to cut bread
The drawer stuck because he pulled sideways
In a temper he dragged it so that it flew out bodily and spoons forks knives a hundred metallic things splashed with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor
The baby gave a little convulsed start
What are you doing clumsy drunken fool
the mother cried
Then tha should get the flamin thing thysen
Tha should get up like other women have to an wait on a man
Wait on youwait on you
she cried
Yes I see myself
Yis an Ill learn thee thas got to
Wait on ME yes tha shlt wait on me Never milord
Id wait on a dog at the door first
Whatwhat
He was trying to fit in the drawer
At her last speech be turned round
His face was crimson his eyes bloodshot
He stared at her one silent second in threat
Ph
she went quickly in contempt
He jerked at the drawer in his excitement
It fell cut sharply on his shin and on the reflex he flung it at her
One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer crashed into the fireplace
She swayed almost fell stunned from her chair
To her very soul she was sick she clasped the child tightly to her bosom
A few moments elapsed then with an effort she brought herself to
The baby was crying plaintively
Her left brow was bleeding rather profusely
As she glanced down at the child her brain reeling some drops of blood soaked into its white shawl but the baby was at least not hurt
She balanced her head to keep equilibrium so that the blood ran into her eye
Walter Morel remained as he had stood leaning on the table with one hand looking blank
When he was sufficiently sure of his balance he went across to her swayed caught hold of the back of her rockingchair almost tipping her out then leaning forward over her and swaying as he spoke he said in a tone of wondering concern Did it catch thee
He swayed again as if he would pitch on to the child
With the catastrophe he had lost all balance
Go away she said struggling to keep her presence of mind
He hiccoughed
Letslets look at it he said hiccoughing again
Go away
she cried
Lemmelemme look at it lass
She smelled him of drink felt the unequal pull of his swaying grasp on the back of her rockingchair
Go away she said and weakly she pushed him off
He stood uncertain in balance gazing upon her
Summoning all her strength she rose the baby on one arm
By a cruel effort of will moving as if in sleep she went across to the scullery where she bathed her eye for a minute in cold water but she was too dizzy
Afraid lest she should swoon she returned to her rockingchair trembling in every fibre
By instinct she kept the baby clasped
Morel bothered had succeeded in pushing the drawer back into its cavity and was on his knees groping with numb paws for the scattered spoons
Her brow was still bleeding
Presently Morel got up and came craning his neck towards her
What has it done to thee lass
he asked in a very wretched humble tone
You can see what its done she answered
He stood bending forward supported on his hands which grasped his legs just above the knee
He peered to look at the wound
She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great moustache averting her own face as much as possible
As he looked at her who was cold and impassive as stone with mouth shut tight he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit
He was turning drearily away when he saw a drop of blood fall from the averted wound into the babys fragile glistening hair
Fascinated he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening cloud and pull down the gossamer
Another drop fell
It would soak through to the babys scalp
He watched fascinated feeling it soak in then finally his manhood broke
What of this child
was all his wife said to him
But her low intense tones brought his head lower
She softened Get me some wadding out of the middle drawer she said
He stumbled away very obediently presently returning with a pad which she singed before the fire then put on her forehead as she sat with the baby on her lap
Now that clean pitscarf
Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer returning presently with a red narrow scarf
She took it and with trembling fingers proceeded to bind it round her head
Let me tie it for thee he said humbly
I can do it myself she replied
When it was done she went upstairs telling him to rake the fire and lock the door
In the morning Mrs Morel said I knocked against the latch of the coalplace when I was getting a raker in the dark because the candle blew out
Her two small children looked up at her with wide dismayed eyes
They said nothing but their parted lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt
Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinnertime
He did not think of the previous evenings work
He scarcely thought of anything but he would not think of that
He lay and suffered like a sulking dog
He had hurt himself most and he was the more damaged because he would never say a word to her or express his sorrow
He tried to wriggle out of it
It was her own fault he said to himself
Nothing however could prevent his inner consciousness inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like rust and which he could only alleviate by drinking
He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up or to say a word or to move but could only lie like a log
Moreover he had himself violent pains in the head
It was Saturday
Towards noon he rose cut himself food in the pantry ate it with his head dropped then pulled on his boots and went out to return at three oclock slightly tipsy and relieved then once more straight to bed
He rose again at six in the evening had tea and went straight out
Sunday was the same bed till noon the Palmerston Arms till 230 dinner and bed scarcely a word spoken
When Mrs Morel went upstairs towards four oclock to put on her Sunday dress he was fast asleep
She would have felt sorry for him if he had once said Wife Im sorry
But no he insisted to himself it was her fault
And so he broke himself
So she merely left him alone
There was this deadlock of passion between them and she was stronger
The family began tea
Sunday was the only day when all sat down to meals together
Isnt my father going to get up
asked William
Let him lie the mother replied
There was a feeling of misery over all the house
The children breathed the air that was poisoned and they felt dreary
They were rather disconsolate did not know what to do what to play at
Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed
That was characteristic of him all his life
He was all for activity
The prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him
It was near six oclock when he got down
This time he entered without hesitation his wincing sensitiveness having hardened again
He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt
The teathings were on the table
William was reading aloud from The Childs Own Annie listening and asking eternally why
Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching thud of their fathers stockinged feet and shrank as he entered
Yet he was usually indulgent to them
Morel made the meal alone brutally
He ate and drank more noisily than he had need
No one spoke to him
The family life withdrew shrank away and became hushed as he entered
But he cared no longer about his alienation
Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out
It was this alacrity this haste to be gone which so sickened Mrs Morel
As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water heard the eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl as he wetted his hair she closed her eyes in disgust
As he bent over lacing his boots there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement that divided him from the reserved watchful rest of the family
He always ran away from the battle with himself
Even in his own hearts privacy he excused himself saying If she hadnt said soandso it would never have happened
She asked for what shes got
The children waited in restraint during his preparations
When he had gone they sighed with relief
He closed the door behind him and was glad
It was a rainy evening
The Palmerston would be the cosier
He hastened forward in anticipation
All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone black with wet
The roads always dark with coaldust were full of blackish mud
He hastened along
The Palmerston windows were steamed over
The passage was paddled with wet feet
But the air was warm if foul and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer and smoke
What shollt hae Walter
cried a voice as soon as Morel appeared in the doorway
Oh Jim my lad wheriver has thee sprung frae
The men made a seat for him and took him in warmly
He was glad
In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of him all shame all trouble and he was clear as a bell for a jolly night
On the Wednesday following Morel was penniless
He dreaded his wife
Having hurt her he hated her
He did not know what to do with himself that evening having not even twopence with which to go to the Palmerston and being already rather deeply in debt
So while his wife was down the garden with the child he hunted in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse found it and looked inside
It contained a halfcrown two halfpennies and a sixpence
So he took the sixpence put the purse carefully back and went out
The next day when she wanted to pay the greengrocer she looked in the purse for her sixpence and her heart sank to her shoes
Then she sat down and thought WAS there a sixpence
I hadnt spent it had I
And I hadnt left it anywhere else
She was much put about
She hunted round everywhere for it
And as she sought the conviction came into her heart that her husband had taken it
What she had in her purse was all the money she possessed
But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable
He had done so twice before
The first time she had not accused him and at the weekend he had put the shilling again into her purse
So that was how she had known he had taken it
The second time he had not paid back
This time she felt it was too much
When he had had his dinner he came home early that dayshe said to him coldly Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night
Me
he said looking up in an offended way
No I didna
I niver clapped eyes on your purse
But she could detect the lie
Why you know you did she said quietly
I tell you I didna he shouted
Yer at me again are yer
Ive had about enough ont
So you filch sixpence out of my purse while Im taking the clothes in
Ill may yer pay for this he said pushing back his chair in desperation
He bustled and got washed then went determinedly upstairs
Presently he came down dressed and with a big bundle in a bluechecked enormous handkerchief
And now he said youll see me again when you do
Itll be before I want to she replied and at that he marched out of the house with his bundle
She sat trembling slightly but her heart brimming with contempt
What would she do if he went to some other pit obtained work and got in with another woman
But she knew him too wellhe couldnt
She was dead sure of him
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her
Wheres my dad
said William coming in from school
He says hes run away replied the mother
Where to
Eh I dont know
Hes taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief and says hes not coming back
What shall we do
cried the boy
Eh never trouble he wont go far
But if he doesnt come back wailed Annie
And she and William retired to the sofa and wept
Mrs Morel sat and laughed
You pair of gabeys
she exclaimed
Youll see him before the nights out
But the children were not to be consoled
Twilight came on
Mrs Morel grew anxious from very weariness
One part of her said it would be a relief to see the last of him another part fretted because of keeping the children and inside her as yet she could not quite let him go
At the bottom she knew very well he could NOT go
When she went down to the coalplace at the end of the garden however she felt something behind the door
So she looked
And there in the dark lay the big blue bundle
She sat on a piece of coal and laughed
Every time she saw it so fat and yet so ignominious slunk into its corner in the dark with its ends flopping like dejected ears from the knots she laughed again
She was relieved
Mrs Morel sat waiting
He had not any money she knew so if he stopped he was running up a bill
She was very tired of him tired to death
He had not even the courage to carry his bundle beyond the yardend
As she meditated at about nine oclock he opened the door and came in slinking and yet sulky
She said not a word
He took off his coat and slunk to his armchair where he began to take off his boots
Youd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off she said quietly
You may thank your stars Ive come back tonight he said looking up from under his dropped head sulkily trying to be impressive
Why where should you have gone
You darent even get your parcel through the yardend she said
He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him
He continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed
I dont know whats in your blue handkerchief she said
But if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the morning
Whereupon he got up and went out of the house returning presently and crossing the kitchen with averted face hurrying upstairs
As Mrs Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner doorway holding his bundle she laughed to herself but her heart was bitter because she had loved him
CHAPTER III THE CASTING OFF OF MORELTHE TAKING ON OF WILLIAM DURING the next week Morels temper was almost unbearable
Like all miners he was a great lover of medicines which strangely enough he would often pay for himself
You mun get me a drop o laxy vitral he said
Its a winder as we canna hae a sup i th ouse
So Mrs Morel bought him elixir of vitriol his favourite first medicine
And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea
He had hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs wormwood rue horehound elder flowers parsleypurt marshmallow hyssop dandelion and centaury
Usually there was a jug of one or other decoction standing on the hob from which he drank largely
Grand
he said smacking his lips after wormwood
Grand
And he exhorted the children to try
Its better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews he vowed
But they were not to be tempted
This time however neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs would shift the nasty peens in his head
He was sickening for an attack of an inflammation of the brain
He had never been well since his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry to Nottingham
Since then he had drunk and stormed
Now he fell seriously ill and Mrs Morel had him to nurse
He was one of the worst patients imaginable
But in spite of all and putting aside the fact that he was breadwinner she never quite wanted him to die
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself
The neighbours were very good to her occasionally some had the children in to meals occasionally some would do the downstairs work for her one would mind the baby for a day
But it was a great drag nevertheless
It was not every day the neighbours helped
Then she had nursing of baby and husband cleaning and cooking everything to do
She was quite worn out but she did what was wanted of her
And the money was just sufficient
She had seventeen shillings a week from clubs and every Friday Barker and the other butty put by a portion of the stalls profits for Morels wife
And the neighbours made broths and gave eggs and such invalids trifles
If they had not helped her so generously in those times Mrs Morel would never have pulled through without incurring debts that would have dragged her down
The weeks passed
Morel almost against hope grew better
He had a fine constitution so that once on the mend he went straight forward to recovery
Soon he was pottering about downstairs
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little
Now he wanted her to continue
He often put his band to his head pulled down the comers of his mouth and shammed pains he did not feel
But there was no deceiving her
At first she merely smiled to herself
Then she scolded him sharply
Goodness man dont be so lachrymose
That wounded him slightly but still he continued to feign sickness
I wouldnt be such a mardy baby said the wife shortly
Then he was indignant and cursed under his breath like a boy
He was forced to resume a normal tone and to cease to whine
Nevertheless there was a state of peace in the house for some time
Mrs Morel was more tolerant of him and he depending on her almost like a child was rather happy
Neither knew that she was more tolerant because she loved him less
Up till this time in spite of all he had been her husband and her man
She had felt that more or less what he did to himself he did to her
Her living depended on him
There were many many stages in the ebbing of her love for him but it was always ebbing
Now with the birth of this third baby her self no longer set towards him helplessly but was like a tide that scarcely rose standing off from him
After this she scarcely desired him
And standing more aloof from him not feeling him so much part of herself but merely part of her circumstances she did not mind so much what he did could leave him alone
There was the halt the wistfulness about the ensuing year which is like autumn in a mans life
His wife was casting him off half regretfully but relentlessly casting him off and turning now for love and life to the children
Henceforward he was more or less a husk
And he himself acquiesced as so many men do yielding their place to their children
During his recuperation when it was really over between them both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship of the first months of their marriage
He sat at home and when the children were in bed and she was sewingshe did all her sewing by hand made all shirts and childrens clothinghe would read to her from the newspaper slowly pronouncing and delivering the words like a man pitching quoits
Often she hurried him on giving him a phrase in anticipation
And then he took her words humbly
The silences between them were peculiar
There would be the swift slight cluck of her needle the sharp pop of his lips as he let out the smoke the warmth the sizzle on the bars as he spat in the fire
Then her thoughts turned to William
Already he was getting a big boy
Already he was top of the class and the master said he was the smartest lad in the school
She saw him a man young full of vigour making the world glow again for her
And Morel sitting there quite alone and having nothing to think about would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable
His soul would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone
He felt a sort of emptiness almost like a vacuum in his soul
He was unsettled and restless
Soon he could not live in that atmosphere and he affected his wife
Both felt an oppression on their breathing when they were left together for some time
Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone working thinking living
Meanwhile another infant was coming fruit of this little peace and tenderness between the separating parents
Paul was seventeen months old when the new baby was born
He was then a plump pale child quiet with heavy blue eyes and still the peculiar slight knitting of the brows
The last child was also a boy fair and bonny
Mrs Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband but not for the sake of the infant
They called the baby Arthur
He was very pretty with a mop of gold curls and he loved his father from the first
Mrs Morel was glad this child loved the father
Hearing the miners footsteps the baby would put up his arms and crow
And if Morel were in a good temper he called back immediately in his hearty mellow voice What then my beauty
I shll come to thee in a minute
And as soon as he had taken off his pitcoat Mrs Morel would put an apron round the child and give him to his father
What a sight the lad looks
she would exclaim sometimes taking back the baby that was smutted on the face from his fathers kisses and play
Then Morel laughed joyfully
Hes a little collier bless his bit o mutton
he exclaimed
And these were the happy moments of her life now when the children included the father in her heart
Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active while Paul always rather delicate and quiet got slimmer and trotted after his mother like her shadow
He was usually active and interested but sometimes he would have fits of depression
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on the sofa
Whats the matter
she asked and got no answer
Whats the matter
she insisted getting cross
I dont know sobbed the child
So she tried to reason him out of it or to amuse him but without effect
It made her feel beside herself
Then the father always impatient would jump from his chair and shout If he doesnt stop Ill smack him till he does
Youll do nothing of the sort said the mother coldly
And then she carried the child into the yard plumped him into his little chair and said Now cry there Misery
And then a butterfly on the rhubarbleaves perhaps caught his eye or at last he cried himself to sleep
These fits were not often but they caused a shadow in Mrs Morels heart and her treatment of Paul was different from that of the other children
Suddenly one morning as she was looking down the alley of the Bottoms for the barmman she heard a voice calling her
It was the thin little Mrs Anthony in brown velvet
Here Mrs Morel I want to tell you about your Willie
Oh do you
replied Mrs Morel
Why whats the matter
A lad as gets old of another an rips his clothes offn is back Mrs Anthony said wants showing something
Your Alfreds as old as my William said Mrs Morel
Appen e is but that doesnt give him a right to get hold of the boys collar an fair rip it clean off his back
Well said Mrs Morel I dont thrash my children and even if I did I should want to hear their side of the tale
Theyd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding retorted Mrs Anthony
When it comes ter rippin a lads clean collar offn is back apurpose Im sure he didnt do it on purpose said Mrs Morel
Make me a liar
shouted Mrs Anthony
Mrs Morel moved away and closed her gate
Her hand trembled as she held her mug of barm
But I sll let your mester know Mrs Anthony cried after her
At dinnertime when William had finished his meal and wanted to be off againhe was then eleven years oldhis mother said to him What did you tear Alfred Anthonys collar for
When did I tear his collar
I dont know when but his mother says you did
Whyit was yesterdayan it was torn aready
But you tore it more
Well Id got a cobbler as ad licked seventeenan Alfy Antny e says Adam an Eve an pinchme Went down to a river to bade
Adam an Eve got drownded Who do yer think got saved
An so I says Oh PinchYOU an so I pinched im an e was mad an so he snatched my cobbler an run off with it
An so I run after im an when I was gettin hold of im e dodged an it ripped is collar
But I got my cobbler He pulled from his pocket a black old horsechestnut hanging on a string
This old cobbler had cobbledhit and smashedseventeen other cobblers on similar strings
So the boy was proud of his veteran
Well said Mrs Morel you know youve got no right to rip his collar
Well our mother
he answered
I never meant tra done itan it was ony an old indirrubber collar as was torn aready
Next time said his mother YOU be more careful
I shouldnt like it if you came home with your collar torn off
I dont care our mother I never did it apurpose
The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded
Nowell you be more careful
William fled away glad to be exonerated
And Mrs Morel who hated any bother with the neighbours thought she would explain to Mrs Anthony and the business would be over
But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour
He stood in the kitchen and glared round but did not speak for some minutes
Then Wheers that Willy
he asked
What do you want HIM for
asked Mrs Morel who had guessed
Ill let im know when I get him said Morel banging his pitbottle on to the dresser
I suppose Mrs Anthonys got hold of you and been yarning to you about Alfys collar said Mrs Morel rather sneering
Niver mind whos got hold of me said Morel
When I get hold of IM Ill make his bones rattle
Its a poor tale said Mrs Morel that youre so ready to side with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales against your own children
Ill learn im
said Morel
It none matters to me whose lad e is es none goin rippin an tearin about just as hes a mind
Ripping and tearing about
repeated Mrs Morel
He was running after that Alfy whod taken his cobbler and he accidentally got hold of his collar because the other dodgedas an Anthony would
I know
shouted Morel threateningly
You would before youre told replied his wife bitingly
Niver you mind stormed Morel
I know my business
Thats more than doubtful said Mrs Morel supposing some loudmouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own children
I know repeated Morel
And he said no more but sat and nursed his bad temper
Suddenly William ran in saying Can I have my tea mother
Tha can hae more than that
shouted Morel
Hold your noise man said Mrs Morel and dont look so ridiculous
Hell look ridiculous before Ive done wi him
shouted Morel rising from his chair and glaring at his son
William who was a tall lad for his years but very sensitive had gone pale and was looking in a sort of horror at his father
Go out
Mrs Morel commanded her son
William had not the wit to move
Suddenly Morel clenched his fist and crouched
Ill GIE him go out
he shouted like an insane thing
What
cried Mrs Morel panting with rage
You shall not touch him for HER telling you shall not
Shonna I
shouted Morel
Shonna I
And glaring at the boy he ran forward
Mrs Morel sprang in between them with her fist lifted
Dont you DARE
she cried
What
he shouted baffled for the moment
What
She spun round to her son
GO out of the house
she commanded him in fury
The boy as if hypnotised by her turned suddenly and was gone
Morel rushed to the door but was too late
He returned pale under his pitdirt with fury
But now his wife was fully roused
Only dare
she said in a loud ringing voice
Only dare milord to lay a finger on that child
Youll regret it for ever
He was afraid of her
In a towering rage he sat down
When the children were old enough to be left Mrs Morel joined the Womens Guild
It was a little club of women attached to the Cooperative Wholesale Society which met on Monday night in the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood Coop
The women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived from cooperation and other social questions
Sometimes Mrs Morel read a paper
It seemed queer to the children to see their mother who was always busy about the house sitting writing in her rapid fashion thinking referring to books and writing again
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect
But they loved the Guild
It was the only thing to which they did not grudge their motherand that partly because she enjoyed it partly because of the treats they derived from it
The Guild was called by some hostile husbands who found their wives getting too independent the clatfart shopthat is the gossipshop
It is true from off the basis of the Guild the women could look at their homes at the conditions of their own lives and find fault
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their own rather disconcerting
And also Mrs Morel always had a lot of news on Monday nights so that the children liked William to be in when their mother came home because she told him things
Then when the lad was thirteen she got him a job in the Coop
office
He was a very clever boy frank with rather rough features and real viking blue eyes
What dost want ter mae a stoolharsed Jack on im for
said Morel
All hell do is to wear his britches behind out an earn nowt
Whats e startin wi
It doesnt matter what hes starting with said Mrs Morel
It wouldna
Put im i th pit we me an ell earn a easy ten shillin a wik from th start
But six shillin wearin his truckend out on a stools better than ten shillin i th pit wime I know
He is NOT going in the pit said Mrs Morel and theres an end of it
It wor good enough for me but its non good enough for im
If your mother put you in the pit at twelve its no reason why I should do the same with my lad
Twelve
It wor a sight afore that
Whenever it was said Mrs Morel
She was very proud of her son
He went to the night school and learned shorthand so that by the time he was sixteen he was the best shorthand clerk and bookkeeper on the place except one
Then he taught in the night schools
But he was so fiery that only his goodnature and his size protected him
All the things that men dothe decent thingsWilliam did
He could run like the wind
When he was twelve he won a first prize in a race an inkstand of glass shaped like an anvil
It stood proudly on the dresser and gave Mrs Morel a keen pleasure
The boy only ran for her
He flew home with his anvil breathless with a Look mother
That was the first real tribute to herself
She took it like a queen
How pretty
she exclaimed
Then he began to get ambitious
He gave all his money to his mother
When he earned fourteen shillings a week she gave him back two for himself and as he never drank he felt himself rich
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood
The townlet contained nothing higher than the clergyman
Then came the bank manager then the doctors then the tradespeople and after that the hosts of colliers
Willam began to consort with the sons of the chemist the schoolmaster and the tradesmen
He played billiards in the Mechanics Hall
Also he dancedthis in spite of his mother
All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed from the sixpennyhops down Church Street to sports and billiards
Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of flowerlike ladies most of whom lived like cut blooms in Williams heart for a brief fortnight
Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant swain
Mrs Morel would find a strange girl at the door and immediately she sniffed the air
Is Mr Morel in
the damsel would ask appealingly
My husband is at home Mrs Morel replied
II mean YOUNG Mr Morel repeated the maiden painfully
Which one
There are several
Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one
II met Mr Morelat Ripley she explained
Ohat a dance
Yes
I dont approve of the girls my son meets at dances
And he is NOT at home
Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned the girl away so rudely
He was a careless yet eagerlooking fellow who walked with long strides sometimes frowning often with his cap pushed jollily to the back of his head
Now he came in frowning
He threw his cap on to the sofa and took his strong jaw in his hand and glared down at his mother
She was small with her hair taken straight back from her forehead
She had a quiet air of authority and yet of rare warmth
Knowing her son was angry she trembled inwardly
Did a lady call for me yesterday mother
he asked
I dont know about a lady
There was a girl came
And why didnt you tell me
Because I forgot simply
He fumed a little
A goodlooking girlseemed a lady
I didnt look at her
Big brown eyes
I did NOT look
And tell your girls my son that when theyre running after you theyre not to come and ask your mother for you
Tell them thatbrazen baggages you meet at dancingclasses
Im sure she was a nice girl
And Im sure she wasnt
There ended the altercation
Over the dancing there was a great strife between the mother and the son
The grievance reached its height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkardconsidered a low townto a fancydress ball
He was to be a Highlander
There was a dress he could hire which one of his friends had had and which fitted him perfectly
The Highland suit came home
Mrs Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it
My suit come
cried William
Theres a parcel in the front room
He rushed in and cut the string
How do you fancy your son in this
he said enraptured showing her the suit
You know I dont want to fancy you in it
On the evening of the dance when he had come home to dress Mrs Morel put on her coat and bonnet
Arent you going to stop and see me mother
he asked
No I dont want to see you she replied
She was rather pale and her face was closed and hard
She was afraid of her sons going the same way as his father
He hesitated a moment and his heart stood still with anxiety
Then he caught sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons
He picked it up gleefully forgetting her
She went out
When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Coop
office and got a situation in Nottingham
In his new place he had thirty shillings a week instead of eighteen
This was indeed a rise
His mother and his father were brimmed up with pride
Everybody praised William
It seemed he was going to get on rapidly
Mrs Morel hoped with his aid to help her younger sons
Annie was now studying to be a teacher
Paul also very clever was getting on well having lessons in French and German from his godfather the clergyman who was still a friend to Mrs Morel
Arthur a spoilt and very goodlooking boy was at the Board school but there was talk of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School in Nottingham
William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham
He was studying hard and growing serious
Something seemed to be fretting him
Still he went out to the dances and the river parties
He did not drink
The children were all rabid teetotallers
He came home very late at night and sat yet longer studying
His mother implored him to take more care to do one thing or another
Dance if you want to dance my son but dont think you can work in the office and then amuse yourself and THEN study on top of all
You cant the human frame wont stand it
Do one thing or the otheramuse yourself or learn Latin but dont try to do both
Then he got a place in London at a hundred and twenty a year
This seemed a fabulous sum
His mother doubted almost whether to rejoice or to grieve
They want me in Lime Street on Monday week mother he cried his eyes blazing as he read the letter
Mrs Morel felt everything go silent inside her
He read the letter And will you reply by Thursday whether you accept
Yours faithfully They want me mother at a hundred and twenty a year and dont even ask to see me
Didnt I tell you I could do it
Think of me in London
And I can give you twenty pounds a year mater
We sll all be rolling in money
We shall my son she answered sadly
It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going away than glad of his success
Indeed as the days drew near for his departure her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair
She loved him so much
More than that she hoped in him so much
Almost she lived by him
She liked to do things for him she liked to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars of which he was so proud
It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars
There was no laundry
So she used to rub away at them with her little convex iron to polish them till they shone from the sheer pressure of her arm
Now she would not do it for him
Now he was going away
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her heart
He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself
That was the grief and the pain to her
He took nearly all himself away
A few days before his departurehe was just twentyhe burned his loveletters
They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen cupboard
From some of them he had read extracts to his mother
Some of them she had taken the trouble to read herself
But most were too trivial
Now on the Saturday morning he said Come on Postle lets go through my letters and you can have the birds and flowers
Mrs Morel had done her Saturdays work on the Friday because he was having a last days holiday
She was making him a rice cake which he loved to take with him
He was scarcely conscious that she was so miserable
He took the first letter off the file
It was mauvetinted and had purple and green thistles
William sniffed the page
Nice scent
Smell
And he thrust the sheet under Pauls nose
Um
said Paul breathing in
What dyou call it
Smell mother
His mother ducked her small fine nose down to the paper
I dont want to smell their rubbish she said sniffing
This girls father said William is as rich as Croesus
He owns property without end
She calls me Lafayette because I know French
You will see Ive forgiven youI like HER forgiving me
I told mother about you this morning and she will have much pleasure if you come to tea on Sunday but she will have to get fathers consent also
I sincerely hope he will agree
I will let you know how it transpires
If however you Let you know how it what
interrupted Mrs Morel
Transpiresoh yes
Transpires
repeated Mrs Morel mockingly
I thought she was so well educated
William felt slightly uncomfortable and abandoned this maiden giving Paul the corner with the thistles
He continued to read extracts from his letters some of which amused his mother some of which saddened her and made her anxious for him
My lad she said theyre very wise
They know theyve only got to flatter your vanity and you press up to them like a dog that has its head scratched
Well they cant go on scratching for ever he replied
And when theyve done I trot away
But one day youll find a string round your neck that you cant pull off she answered
Not me
Im equal to any of em mater they neednt flatter themselves
You flatter YOURSELF she said quietly
Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages all that remained of the file of scented letters except that Paul had thirty or forty pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaperswallows and forgetmenots and ivy sprays
And William went to London to start a new life
CHAPTER IV THE YOUNG LIFE OF PAUL PAUL would be built like his mother slightly and rather small
His fair hair went reddish and then dark brown his eyes were grey
He was a pale quiet child with eyes that seemed to listen and with a full dropping underlip
As a rule he seemed old for his years
He was so conscious of what other people felt particularly his mother
When she fretted he understood and could have no peace
His soul seemed always attentive to her
As he grew older he became stronger
William was too far removed from him to accept him as a companion
So the smaller boy belonged at first almost entirely to Annie
She was a tomboy and a flybieskybie as her mother called her
But she was intensely fond of her second brother
So Paul was towed round at the heels of Annie sharing her game
She raced wildly at lerky with the other young wildcats of the Bottoms
And always Paul flew beside her living her share of the game having as yet no part of his own
He was quiet and not noticeable
But his sister adored him
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to
She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud though not so fond
So she laid the doll on the sofa and covered it with an antimacassar to sleep
Then she forgot it
Meantime Paul must practise jumping off the sofa arm
So he jumped crash into the face of the hidden doll
Annie rushed up uttered a loud wail and sat down to weep a dirge
Paul remained quite still
You couldnt tell it was there mother you couldnt tell it was there he repeated over and over
So long as Annie wept for the doll he sat helpless with misery
Her grief wore itself out
She forgave her brotherhe was so much upset
But a day or two afterwards she was shocked
Lets make a sacrifice of Arabella he said
Lets burn her
She was horrified yet rather fascinated
She wanted to see what the boy would do
He made an altar of bricks pulled some of the shavings out of Arabellas body put the waxen fragments into the hollow face poured on a little paraffin and set the whole thing alight
He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt off the broken forehead of Arabella and drop like sweat into the flame
So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick fished out the arms and legs all blackened and smashed them under stones
Thats the sacrifice of Missis Arabella he said
An Im glad theres nothing left of her
Which disturbed Annie inwardly although she could say nothing
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely because he had broken it
All the children but particularly Paul were peculiarly against their father along with their mother
Morel continued to bully and to drink
He had periods months at a time when he made the whole life of the family a misery
Paul never forgot coming home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured his father standing on the hearthrug feet astride his head down and William just home from work glaring at his father
There was a silence as the young children entered but none of the elders looked round
William was white to the lips and his fists were clenched
He waited until the children were silent watching with childrens rage and hate then he said You coward you darent do it when I was in
But Morels blood was up
He swung round on his son
William was bigger but Morel was hardmuscled and mad with fury
Dossnt I
he shouted
Dossnt I
Hae much more o thy chelp my young jockey an Ill rattle my fist about thee
Ay an I sholl that dost see
Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly almost beastlike fashion
William was white with rage
Will yer
he said quiet and intense
It ud be the last time though
Morel danced a little nearer crouching drawing back his fist to strike
William put his fists ready
A light came into his blue eyes almost like a laugh
He watched his father
Another word and the men would have begun to fight
Paul hoped they would
The three children sat pale on the sofa
Stop it both of you cried Mrs Morel in a hard voice
Weve had enough for ONE night
And YOU she said turning on to her husband look at your children
Morel glanced at the sofa
Look at the children you nasty little bitch
he sneered
Why what have I done to the children I should like to know
But theyre like yourself youve put em up to your own tricks and nasty waysyouve learned em in it you ave
She refused to answer him
No one spoke
After a while he threw his boots under the table and went to bed
Why didnt you let me have a go at him
said William when his father was upstairs
I could easily have beaten him
A nice thingyour own father she replied
FATHER
repeated William
Call HIM MY father
Well he isand so But why dont you let me settle him
I could do easily
The idea
she cried
It hasnt come to THAT yet
No he said its come to worse
Look at yourself
WHY didnt you let me give it him
Because I couldnt bear it so never think of it she cried quickly
And the children went to bed miserably
When William was growing up the family moved from the Bottoms to a house on the brow of the hill commanding a view of the valley which spread out like a convex cockleshell or a clampshell before it
In front of the house was a huge old ashtree
The west wind sweeping from Derbyshire caught the houses with full force and the tree shrieked again
Morel liked it
Its music he said
It sends me to sleep
But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it
To Paul it became almost a demoniacal noise
The winter of their first year in the new house their father was very bad
The children played in the street on the brim of the wide dark valley until eight oclock
Then they went to bed
Their mother sat sewing below
Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children a feeling of night of vastness and of terror
This terror came in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord
Often Paul would wake up after he had been asleep a long time aware of thuds downstairs
Instantly he was wide awake
Then he heard the booming shouts of his father come home nearly drunk then the sharp replies of his mother then the bang bang of his fathers fist on the table and the nasty snarling shout as the mans voice got higher
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks and cries from the great windswept ashtree
The children lay silent in suspense waiting for a lull in the wind to hear what their father was doing
He might hit their mother again
There was a feeling of horror a kind of bristling in the darkness and a sense of blood
They lay with their hearts in the grip of an intense anguish
The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer
All the chords of the great harp hummed whistled and shrieked
And then came the horror of the sudden silence silence everywhere outside and downstairs
What was it
Was it a silence of blood
What had he done
The children lay and breathed the darkness
And then at last they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs in his stockinged feet
Still they listened
Then at last if the wind allowed they heard the water of the tap drumming into the kettle which their mother was filling for morning and they could go to sleep in peace
So they were happy in the morninghappy very happy playing dancing at night round the lonely lamppost in the midst of the darkness
But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts one darkness in their eyes which showed all their lives
Paul hated his father
As a boy he had a fervent private religion
Make him stop drinking he prayed every night
Lord let my father die he prayed very often
Let him not be killed at pit he prayed when after tea the father did not come home from work
That was another time when the family suffered intensely
The children came from school and had their teas
On the hob the big black saucepan was simmering the stewjar was in the oven ready for Morels dinner
He was expected at five oclock
But for months he would stop and drink every night on his way from work
In the winter nights when it was cold and grew dark early Mrs Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table light a tallow candle to save the gas
The children finished their breadandbutter or dripping and were ready to go out to play
But if Morel had not come they faltered
The sense of his sitting in all his pitdirt drinking after a long days work not coming home and eating and washing but sitting getting drunk on an empty stomach made Mrs Morel unable to bear herself
From her the feeling was transmitted to the other children
She never suffered alone any more the children suffered with her
Paul went out to play with the rest
Down in the great trough of twilight tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were
A few last colliers straggled up the dim field path
The lamplighter came along
No more colliers came
Darkness shut down over the valley work was done
It was night
Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen
The one candle still burned on the table the big fire glowed red
Mrs Morel sat alone
On the hob the saucepan steamed the dinnerplate lay waiting on the table
All the room was full of the sense of waiting waiting for the man who was sitting in his pitdirt dinnerless some mile away from home across the darkness drinking himself drunk
Paul stood in the doorway
Has my dad come
he asked
You can see he hasnt said Mrs Morel cross with the futility of the question
Then the boy dawdled about near his mother
They shared the same anxiety
Presently Mrs Morel went out and strained the potatoes
Theyre ruined and black she said but what do I care
Not many words were spoken
Paul almost hated his mother for suffering because his father did not come home from work
What do you bother yourself for
he said
If he wants to stop and get drunk why dont you let him
Let him
flashed Mrs Morel
You may well say let him
She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is on a quick way to ruining himself and his home
The children were yet young and depended on the breadwinner
William gave her the sense of relief providing her at last with someone to turn to if Morel failed
But the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting evenings was the same
The minutes ticked away
At six oclock still the cloth lay on the table still the dinner stood waiting still the same sense of anxiety and expectation in the room
The boy could not stand it any longer
He could not go out and play
So he ran in to Mrs Inger next door but one for her to talk to him
She had no children
Her husband was good to her but was in a shop and came home late
So when she saw the lad at the door she called Come in Paul
The two sat talking for some time when suddenly the boy rose saying Well Ill be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand doing
He pretended to be perfectly cheerful and did not tell his friend what ailed him
Then he ran indoors
Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful
This is a nice time to come home said Mrs Morel
Whas it matter to yo what time I come whoam
he shouted
And everybody in the house was still because he was dangerous
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible and when he had done pushed all the pots in a heap away from him to lay his arms on the table
Then he went to sleep
Paul hated his father so
The colliers small mean head with its black hair slightly soiled with grey lay on the bare arms and the face dirty and inflamed with a fleshy nose and thin paltry brows was turned sideways asleep with beer and weariness and nasty temper
If anyone entered suddenly or a noise were made the man looked up and shouted Ill lay my fist about thy yead Im tellin thee if tha doesna stop that clatter
Dost hear
And the two last words shouted in a bullying fashion usually at Annie made the family writhe with hate of the man
He was shut out from all family affairs
No one told him anything
The children alone with their mother told her all about the days happenings everything
Nothing had really taken place in them until it was told to their mother
But as soon as the father came in everything stopped
He was like the scotch in the smooth happy machinery of the home
And he was always aware of this fall of silence on his entry the shutting off of life the unwelcome
But now it was gone too far to alter
He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him but they could not
Sometimes Mrs Morel would say You ought to tell your father
Paul won a prize in a competition in a childs paper
Everybody was highly jubilant
Now youd better tell your father when be comes in said Mrs Morel
You know how be carries on and says hes never told anything
All right said Paul
But he would almost rather have forfeited the prize than have to tell his father
Ive won a prize in a competition dad he said
Morel turned round to him
Have you my boy
What sort of a competition
Oh nothingabout famous women
And how much is the prize then as youve got
Its a book
Oh indeed 
About birds
Hmhm 
And that was all
Conversation was impossible between the father and any other member of the family
He was an outsider
He had denied the God in him
The only times when he entered again into the life of his own people was when he worked and was happy at work
Sometimes in the evening he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his pitbottle
Then he always wanted several attendants and the children enjoyed it
They united with him in the work in the actual doing of something when he was his real self again
He was a good workman dexterous and one who when he was in a good humour always sang
He had whole periods months almost years of friction and nasty temper
Then sometimes he was jolly again
It was nice to see him run with a piece of redhot iron into the scullery crying Out of my roadout of my road
Then he hammered the soft redglowing stuff on his iron goose and made the shape he wanted
Or he sat absorbed for a moment soldering
Then the children watched with joy as the metal sank suddenly molten and was shoved about against the nose of the solderingiron while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin and hot tin and Morel was silent and intent for a minute
He always sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of hammering
And he was rather happy when he sat putting great patches on his moleskin pit trousers which he would often do considering them too dirty and the stuff too hard for his wife to mend
But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheatstraws from the attic
These he cleaned with his hand till each one gleamed like a stalk of gold after which he cut the straws into lengths of about six inches leaving if he could a notch at the bottom of each piece
He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could cut a straw clean without hurting it
Then he set in the middle of the table a heap of gunpowder a little pile of black grains upon the whitescrubbed board
He made and trimmed the straws while Paul and Annie rifled and plugged them
Paul loved to see the black grains trickle down a crack in his palm into the mouth of the straw peppering jollily downwards till the straw was full
Then he bunged up the mouth with a bit of soapwhich he got on his thumbnail from a pat in a saucerand the straw was finished
Look dad
he said
Thats right my beauty replied Morel who was peculiarly lavish of endearments to his second son
Paul popped the fuse into the powdertin ready for the morning when Morel would take it to the pit and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down
Meantime Arthur still fond of his father would lean on the arm of Morels chair and say Tell us about down pit daddy
This Morel loved to do
Well theres one little osswe call im Taffy he would begin
An hes a fawce un
Morel had a warm way of telling a story
He made one feel Taffys cunning
Hes a brown un he would answer an not very high
Well he comes i th stall wi a rattle an then yo ear im sneeze
Ello Taff you say what art sneezin for
Bin taein some snuff
An e sneezes again
Then he slives up an shoves is ead on yer that cadin
Whats want Taff
yo say
And what does he
Arthur always asked
He wants a bit o bacca my duckie
This story of Taffy would go on interminably and everybody loved it
Or sometimes it was a new tale
An what dost think my darlin
When I went to put my coat on at snaptime what should go runnin up my arm but a mouse
Hey up theer
I shouts
An I wor just in time ter get im by th tail
And did you kill it
I did for theyre a nuisance
The place is fair snied wi em
An what do they live on
The corn as the osses dropsan theyll get in your pocket an eat your snap if youll let emno matter where yo hing your coat the slivin nibblin little nuisances for they are
These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel had some job to do
And then he always went to bed very early often before the children
There was nothing remaining for him to stay up for when he had finished tinkering and had skimmed the headlines of the newspaper
And the children felt secure when their father was in bed
They lay and talked softly a while
Then they started as the lights went suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in the hands of the colliers tramping by outside going to take the nine oclock shift
They listened to the voices of the men imagined them dipping down into the dark valley
Sometimes they went to the window and watched the three or four lamps growing tinier and tinier swaying down the fields in the darkness
Then it was a joy to rush back to bed and cuddle closely in the warmth
Paul was rather a delicate boy subject to bronchitis
The others were all quite strong so this was another reason for his mothers difference in feeling for him
One day he came home at dinnertime feeling ill
But it was not a family to make any fuss
Whats the matter with YOU
his mother asked sharply
Nothing he replied
But he ate no dinner
If you eat no dinner youre not going to school she said
Why
he asked
Thats why
So after dinner he lay down on the sofa on the warm chintz cushions the children loved
Then he fell into a kind of doze
That afternoon Mrs Morel was ironing
She listened to the small restless noise the boy made in his throat as she worked
Again rose in her heart the old almost weary feeling towards him
She had never expected him to live
And yet he had a great vitality in his young body
Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him
He in his semiconscious sleep was vaguely aware of the clatter of the iron on the ironstand of the faint thud thud on the ironingboard
Once roused he opened his eyes to see his mother standing on the hearthrug with the hot iron near her cheek listening as it were to the heat
Her still face with the mouth closed tight from suffering and disillusion and selfdenial and her nose the smallest bit on one side and her blue eyes so young quick and warm made his heart contract with love
When she was quiet so she looked brave and rich with life but as if she had been done out of her rights
It hurt the boy keenly this feeling about her that she had never had her lifes fulfilment and his own incapability to make up to her hurt him with a sense of impotence yet made him patiently dogged inside
It was his childish aim
She spat on the iron and a little ball of spit bounded raced off the dark glossy surface
Then kneeling she rubbed the iron on the sack lining of the hearthrug vigorously
She was warm in the ruddy firelight
Paul loved the way she crouched and put her head on one side
Her movements were light and quick
It was always a pleasure to watch her
Nothing she ever did no movement she ever made could have been found fault with by her children
The room was warm and full of the scent of hot linen
Later on the clergyman came and talked softly with her
Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis
He did not mind much
What happened happened and it was no good kicking against the pricks
He loved the evenings after eight oclock when the light was put out and he could watch the fireflames spring over the darkness of the walls and ceiling could watch huge shadows waving and tossing till the room seemed full of men who battled silently
On retiring to bed the father would come into the sickroom
He was always very gentle if anyone were ill
But he disturbed the atmosphere for the boy
Are ter asleep my darlin
Morel asked softly
No is my mother comin
Shes just finishin foldin the clothes
Do you want anything
Morel rarely theed his son
I dont want nothing
But how long will she be
Not long my duckie
The father waited undecidedly on the hearthrug for a moment or two
He felt his son did not want him
Then he went to the top of the stairs and said to his wife This childts axin for thee how long art goin to be
Until Ive finished good gracious
Tell him to go to sleep
She says youre to go to sleep the father repeated gently to Paul
Well I want HER to come insisted the boy
He says he cant go off till you come Morel called downstairs
Eh dear
I shant be long
And do stop shouting downstairs
Theres the other children Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire
He loved a fire dearly
She says she wont be long he said
He loitered about indefinitely
The boy began to get feverish with irritation
His fathers presence seemed to aggravate all his sick impatience
At last Morel after having stood looking at his son awhile said softly Goodnight my darling
Goodnight Paul replied turning round in relief to be alone
Paul loved to sleep with his mother
Sleep is still most perfect in spite of hygienists when it is shared with a beloved
The warmth the security and peace of soul the utter comfort from the touch of the other knits the sleep so that it takes the body and soul completely in its healing
Paul lay against her and slept and got better whilst she always a bad sleeper fell later on into a profound sleep that seemed to give her faith
In convalescence he would sit up in bed see the fluffy horses feeding at the troughs in the field scattering their hay on the trodden yellow snow watch the miners troop homesmall black figures trailing slowly in gangs across the white field
Then the night came up in dark blue vapour from the snow
In convalescence everything was wonderful
The snowflakes suddenly arriving on the windowpane clung there a moment like swallows then were gone and a drop of water was crawling down the glass
The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house like pigeons dashing by
Away across the valley the little black train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness
While they were so poor the children were delighted if they could do anything to help economically
Annie and Paul and Arthur went out early in the morning in summer looking for mushrooms hunting through the wet grass from which the larks were rising for the whiteskinned wonderful naked bodies crouched secretly in the green
And if they got half a pound they felt exceedingly happy there was the joy of finding something the joy of accepting something straight from the hand of Nature and the joy of contributing to the family exchequer
But the most important harvest after gleaning for frumenty was the blackberries
Mrs Morel must buy fruit for puddings on the Saturdays also she liked blackberries
So Paul and Arthur scoured the coppices and woods and old quarries so long as a blackberry was to be found every weekend going on their search
In that region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative rarity
But Paul hunted far and wide
He loved being out in the country among the bushes
But he also could not bear to go home to his mother empty
That he felt would disappoint her and he would have died rather
Good gracious
she would exclaim as the lads came in late and tired to death and hungry wherever have you been
Well replied Paul there wasnt any so we went over Misk Hills
And look here our mother
She peeped into the basket
Now those are fine ones
she exclaimed
And theres over two poundsisnt there over two pounds
She tried the basket
Yes she answered doubtfully
Then Paul fished out a little spray
He always brought her one spray the best he could find
Pretty
she said in a curious tone of a woman accepting a lovetoken
The boy walked all day went miles and miles rather than own himself beaten and come home to her emptyhanded
She never realised this whilst he was young
She was a woman who waited for her children to grow up
And William occupied her chiefly
But when William went to Nottingham and was not so much at home the mother made a companion of Paul
The latter was unconsciously jealous of his brother and William was jealous of him
At the same time they were good friends
Mrs Morels intimacy with her second son was more subtle and fine perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest
It was the rule that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons
The colliers of the five pits were paid on Fridays but not individually
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty as contractor and he divided the wages again either in the publichouse or in his own home
So that the children could fetch the money school closed early on Friday afternoons
Each of the Morel childrenWilliam then Annie then Paulhad fetched the money on Friday afternoons until they went themselves to work
Paul used to set off at halfpast three with a little calico bag in his pocket
Down all the paths women girls children and men were seen trooping to the offices
These offices were quite handsome a new redbrick building almost like a mansion standing in its own grounds at the end of Greenhill Lane
The waitingroom was the hall a long bare room paved with blue brick and having a seat all round against the wall
Here sat the colliers in their pitdirt
They had come up early
The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths
Paul always examined the grass border and the big grass bank because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forgetmenots
There was a sound of many voices
The women had on their Sunday hats
The girls chattered loudly
Little dogs ran here and there
The green shrubs were silent all around
Then from inside came the cry Spinney ParkSpinney Park
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside
When it was time for Bretty to be paid Paul went in among the crowd
The payroom was quite small
A counter went across dividing it into half
Behind the counter stood two menMr Braithwaite and his clerk Mr Winterbottom
Mr Braithwaite was large somewhat of the stern patriarch in appearance having a rather thin white beard
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief and right up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate
No window was open
Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats of the people coming in from the freshness
Mr Winterbottom was rather small and fat and very bald
He made remarks that were not witty whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions against the colliers
The room was crowded with miners in their pitdirt men who had been home and changed and women and one or two children and usually a dog
Paul was quite small so it was often his fate to be jammed behind the legs of the men near the fire which scorched him
He knew the order of the namesthey went according to stall number
Holliday came the ringing voice of Mr Braithwaite
Then Mrs Holliday stepped silently forward was paid drew aside
BowerJohn Bower
A boy stepped to the counter
Mr Braithwaite large and irascible glowered at him over his spectacles
John Bower
he repeated
Its me said the boy
Why you used to ave a different nose than that said glossy Mr Winterbottom peering over the counter
The people tittered thinking of John Bower senior
How is it your fathers not come
said Mr Braithwaite in a large and magisterial voice
Hes badly piped the boy
You should tell him to keep off the drink pronounced the great cashier
An niver mind if he puts his foot through yer said a mocking voice from behind
All the men laughed
The large and important cashier looked down at his next sheet
Fred Pilkington
he called quite indifferent
Mr Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm
Paul knew his turn was next but one and his heart began to beat
He was pushed against the chimneypiece
His calves were burning
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men
Walter Morel
came the ringing voice
Here
piped Paul small and inadequate
MorelWalter Morel
the cashier repeated his finger and thumb on the invoice ready to pass on
Paul was suffering convulsions of selfconsciousness and could not or would not shout
The backs of the men obliterated him
Then Mr Winterbottom came to the rescue
Hes here
Where is he
Morels lad
The fat red bald little man peered round with keen eyes
He pointed at the fireplace
The colliers looked round moved aside and disclosed the boy
Here he is
said Mr Winterbottom
Paul went to the counter
Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence
Why dont you shout up when youre called
said Mr Braithwaite
He banged on to the invoice a fivepound bag of silver then in a delicate and pretty movement picked up a little tenpound column of gold and plumped it beside the silver
The gold slid in a bright stream over the paper
The cashier finished counting off the money the boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr Winterbottom to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid
Here he suffered again
Sixteen an six said Mr Winterbottom
The lad was too much upset to count
He pushed forward some loose silver and half a sovereign
How much do you think youve given me
asked Mr Winterbottom
The boy looked at him but said nothing
He had not the faintest notion
Havent you got a tongue in your head
Paul bit his lip and pushed forward some more silver
Dont they teach you to count at the Boardschool
he asked
Nowt but algibbra an French said a collier
An cheek an impidence said another
Paul was keeping someone waiting
With trembling fingers he got his money into the bag and slid out
He suffered the tortures of the damned on these occasions
His relief when he got outside and was walking along the Mansfield Road was infinite
On the park wall the mosses were green
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the apple trees of an orchard
The colliers were walking home in a stream
The boy went near the wall selfconsciously
He knew many of the men but could not recognise them in their dirt
And this was a new torture to him
When he got down to the New Inn at Bretty his father was not yet come
Mrs Wharmby the landlady knew him
His grandmother Morels mother had been Mrs Wharmbys friend
Your fathers not come yet said the landlady in the peculiar halfscornful halfpatronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly to grown men
Sit you down
Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar
Some colliers were reckoningsharing out their moneyin a corner others came in
They all glanced at the boy without speaking
At last Morel came brisk and with something of an air even in his blackness
Hello
he said rather tenderly to his son
Have you bested me
Shall you have a drink of something
Paul and all the children were bred up fierce antialcoholists and he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before all the men than in having a tooth drawn
The landlady looked at him de haut en bas rather pitying and at the same time resenting his clear fierce morality
Paul went home glowering
He entered the house silently
Friday was baking day and there was usually a hot bun
His mother put it before him
Suddenly he turned on her in a fury his eyes flashing Im NOT going to the office any more he said
Why whats the matter
his mother asked in surprise
His sudden rages rather amused her
Im NOT going any more he declared
Oh very well tell your father so
He chewed his bun as if he hated it
Im notIm not going to fetch the money
Then one of Carlins children can go theyd be glad enough of the sixpence said Mrs Morel
This sixpence was Pauls only income
It mostly went in buying birthday presents but it WAS an income and he treasured it
But They can have it then
he said
I dont want it
Oh very well said his mother
But you neednt bully ME about it
Theyre hateful and common and hateful they are and Im not going any more
Mr Braithwaite drops his hs an Mr Winterbottom says You was
And is that why you wont go any more
smiled Mrs Morel
The boy was silent for some time
His face was pale his eyes dark and furious
His mother moved about at her work taking no notice of him
They always stan in front of me sos I cant get out he said
Well my lad youve only to ASK them she replied
An then Alfred Winterbottom says What do they teach you at the Boardschool
They never taught HIM much said Mrs Morel that is a fact neither manners nor witand his cunning he was born with
So in her own way she soothed him
His ridiculous hypersensitiveness made her heart ache
And sometimes the fury in his eyes roused her made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment surprised
What was the cheque
she asked
Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence and sixteen and six stoppages replied the boy
Its a good week and only five shillings stoppages for my father
So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned and could call him to account if he gave her short money
Morel always kept to himself the secret of the weeks amount
Friday was the baking night and market night
It was the rule that Paul should stay at home and bake
He loved to stop in and draw or read he was very fond of drawing
Annie always gallivanted on Friday nights Arthur was enjoying himself as usual
So the boy remained alone
Mrs Morel loved her marketing
In the tiny marketplace on the top of the hill where four roads from Nottingham and Derby Ilkeston and Mansfield meet many stalls were erected
Brakes ran in from surrounding villages
The marketplace was full of women the streets packed with men
It was amazing to see so many men everywhere in the streets
Mrs Morel usually quarrelled with her lace woman sympathised with her fruit manwho was a gabey but his wife was a bad unlaughed with the fish manwho was a scamp but so drollput the linoleum man in his place was cold with the oddwares man and only went to the crockery man when she was drivenor drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish then she was coldly polite
I wondered how much that little dish was she said
Sevenpence to you
Thank you
She put the dish down and walked away but she could not leave the marketplace without it
Again she went by where the pots lay coldly on the floor and she glanced at the dish furtively pretending not to
She was a little woman in a bonnet and a black costume
Her bonnet was in its third year it was a great grievance to Annie
Mother
the girl implored dont wear that nubbly little bonnet
Then what else shall I wear replied the mother tartly
And Im sure its right enough
It had started with a tip then had had flowers now was reduced to black lace and a bit of jet
It looks rather come down said Paul
Couldnt you give it a pickmeup
Ill jowl your head for impudence said Mrs Morel and she tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin
She glanced at the dish again
Both she and her enemy the pot man had an uncomfortable feeling as if there were something between them
Suddenly he shouted Do you want it for fivepence
She started
Her heart hardened but then she stooped and took up her dish
Ill have it she said
Yerll do me the favour like
he said
Yerd better spit in it like yer do when yave something give yer
Mrs Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner
I dont see you give it me she said
You wouldnt let me have it for fivepence if you didnt want to
In this flamin scrattlin place you may count yerself lucky if you can give your things away he growled
Yes there are bad times and good said Mrs Morel
But she had forgiven the pot man
They were friends
She dare now finger his pots
So she was happy
Paul was waiting for her
He loved her homecoming
She was always her best sotriumphant tired laden with parcels feeling rich in spirit
He heard her quick light step in the entry and looked up from his drawing
Oh
she sighed smiling at him from the doorway
My word you ARE loaded
he exclaimed putting down his brush
I am
she gasped
That brazen Annie said shed meet me
SUCH a weight
She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table
Is the bread done
she asked going to the oven
The last one is soaking he replied
You neednt look Ive not forgotten it
Oh that pot man
she said closing the oven door
You know what a wretch Ive said he was
Well I dont think hes quite so bad
Dont you
The boy was attentive to her
She took off her little black bonnet
No
I think he cant make any moneywell its everybodys cry alike nowadaysand it makes him disagreeable
It would ME said Paul
Well one cant wonder at it
And he let me havehow much do you think he let me have THIS for
She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper and stood looking on it with joy
Show me
said Paul
The two stood together gloating over the dish
I LOVE cornflowers on things said Paul
Yes and I thought of the teapot you bought me One and three said Paul
Fivepence
Its not enough mother
No
Do you know I fairly sneaked off with it
But Id been extravagant I couldnt afford any more
And he neednt have let me have it if he hadnt wanted to
No he neednt need he said Paul and the two comforted each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man
We cn have stewed fruit in it said Paul
Or custard or a jelly said his mother
Or radishes and lettuce said he
Dont forget that bread she said her voice bright with glee
Paul looked in the oven tapped the loaf on the base
Its done he said giving it to her
She tapped it also
Yes she replied going to unpack her bag
Oh and Im a wicked extravagant woman
I know I sll come to want
He hopped to her side eagerly to see her latest extravagance
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots of pansies and of crimson daisies
Four pennorth
she moaned
How CHEAP
he cried
Yes but I couldnt afford it THIS week of all weeks
But lovely
he cried
Arent they
she exclaimed giving way to pure joy
Paul look at this yellow one isnt itand a face just like an old man
Just
cried Paul stooping to sniff
And smells that nice
But hes a bit splashed
He ran in the scullery came back with the flannel and carefully washed the pansy
NOW look at him now hes wet
he said
Yes
she exclaimed brimful of satisfaction
The children of Scargill Street felt quite select
At the end where the Morels lived there were not many young things
So the few were more united
Boys and girls played together the girls joining in the fights and the rough games the boys taking part in the dancing games and rings and makebelief of the girls
Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings when it was not wet
They stayed indoors till the colliers were all gone home till it was thick dark and the street would be deserted
Then they tied their scarves round their necks for they scorned overcoats as all the colliers children did and went out
The entry was very dark and at the end the whole great night opened out in a hollow with a little tangle of lights below where Minton pit lay and another far away opposite for Selby
The farthest tiny lights seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever
The children looked anxiously down the road at the one lamppost which stood at the end of the field path
If the little luminous space were deserted the two boys felt genuine desolation
They stood with their hands in their pockets under the lamp turning their backs on the night quite miserable watching the dark houses
Suddenly a pinafore under a short coat was seen and a longlegged girl came flying up
Wheres Billy Pillins an your Annie an Eddie Dakin
I dont know
But it did not matter so muchthere were three now
They set up a game round the lamppost till the others rushed up yelling
Then the play went fast and furious
There was only this one lamppost
Behind was the great scoop of darkness as if all the night were there
In front another wide dark way opened over the hill brow
Occasionally somebody came out of this way and went into the field down the path
In a dozen yards the night had swallowed them
The children played on
They were brought exceedingly close together owing to their isolation
If a quarrel took place the whole play was spoilt
Arthur was very touchy and Billy Pillinsreally Philipswas worse
Then Paul had to side with Arthur and on Pauls side went Alice while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie Dakin to back him up
Then the six would fight hate with a fury of hatred and flee home in terror
Paul never forgot after one of these fierce internecine fights seeing a big red moon lift itself up slowly between the waste road over the hilltop steadily like a great bird
And he thought of the Bible that the moon should be turned to blood
And the next day he made haste to be friends with Billy Pillins
And then the wild intense games went on again under the lamppost surrounded by so much darkness
Mrs Morel going into her parlour would hear the children singing away My shoes are made of Spanish leather My socks are made of silk I wear a ring on every finger I wash myself in milk
They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices came out of the night that they had the feel of wild creatures singing
It stirred the mother and she understood when they came in at eight oclock ruddy with brilliant eyes and quick passionate speech
They all loved the Scargill Street house for its openness for the great scallop of the world it had in view
On summer evenings the women would stand against the field fence gossiping facing the west watching the sunsets flare quickly out till the Derbyshire hills ridged across the crimson far away like the black crest of a newt
In this summer season the pits never turned full time particularly the soft coal
Mrs Dakin who lived next door to Mrs Morel going to the field fence to shake her hearthrug would spy men coming slowly up the hill
She saw at once they were colliers
Then she waited a tall thin shrewfaced woman standing on the hill brow almost like a menace to the poor colliers who were toiling up
It was only eleven oclock
From the faroff wooded hills the haze that hangs like fine black crape at the back of a summer morning had not yet dissipated
The first man came to the stile
Chockchock
went the gate under his thrust
What han yer knocked off
cried Mrs Dakin
We han missis
Its a pity as they letn yer goo she said sarcastically
It is that replied the man
Nay you know youre flig to come up again she said
And the man went on
Mrs Dakin going up her yard spied Mrs Morel taking the ashes to the ashpit
I reckon Mintons knocked off missis she cried
Isnt it sickenin
exclaimed Mrs Morel in wrath
Ha
But In just seed Jont Hutchby
They might as well have saved their shoeleather said Mrs Morel
And both women went indoors disgusted
The colliers their faces scarcely blackened were trooping home again
Morel hated to go back
He loved the sunny morning
But he had gone to pit to work and to be sent home again spoilt his temper
Good gracious at this time
exclaimed his wife as he entered
Can I help it woman
he shouted
And Ive not done half enough dinner
Then Ill eat my bit o snap as I took with me he bawled pathetically
He felt ignominious and sore
And the children coming home from school would wonder to see their father eating with his dinner the two thick slices of rather dry and dirty breadandbutter that had been to pit and back
Whats my dad eating his snap for now
asked Arthur
I should hae it holled at me if I didna snorted Morel
What a story
exclaimed his wife
An is it goin to be wasted
said Morel
Im not such a extravagant mortal as you lot with your waste
If I drop a bit of bread at pit in all the dust an dirt I pick it up an eat it
The mice would eat it said Paul
It wouldnt be wasted
Good breadanbutters not for mice either said Morel
Dirty or not dirty Id eat it rather than it should be wasted
You might leave it for the mice and pay for it out of your next pint said Mrs Morel
Oh might I
he exclaimed
They were very poor that autumn
William had just gone away to London and his mother missed his money
He sent ten shillings once or twice but he had many things to pay for at first
His letters came regularly once a week
He wrote a good deal to his mother telling her all his life how he made friends and was exchanging lessons with a Frenchman how he enjoyed London
His mother felt again he was remaining to her just as when he was at home
She wrote to him every week her direct rather witty letters
All day long as she cleaned the house she thought of him
He was in London he would do well
Almost he was like her knight who wore HER favour in the battle
He was coming at Christmas for five days
There had never been such preparations
Paul and Arthur scoured the land for holly and evergreens
Annie made the pretty paper hoops in the oldfashioned way
And there was unheardof extravagance in the larder
Mrs Morel made a big and magnificent cake
Then feeling queenly she showed Paul how to blanch almonds
He skinned the long nuts reverently counting them all to see not one was lost
It was said that eggs whisked better in a cold place
So the boy stood in the scullery where the temperature was nearly at freezingpoint and whisked and whisked and flew in excitement to his mother as the white of egg grew stiffer and more snowy
Just look mother
Isnt it lovely
And he balanced a bit on his nose then blew it in the air
Now dont waste it said the mother
Everybody was mad with excitement
William was coming on Christmas Eve
Mrs Morel surveyed her pantry
There was a big plum cake and a rice cake jam tarts lemon tarts and mincepies two enormous dishes
She was finishing cookingSpanish tarts and cheesecakes
Everywhere was decorated
The kissing bunch of berried holly hung with bright and glittering things spun slowly over Mrs Morels head as she trimmed her little tarts in the kitchen
A great fire roared
There was a scent of cooked pastry
He was due at seven oclock but he would be late
The three children had gone to meet him
She was alone
But at a quarter to seven Morel came in again
Neither wife nor husband spoke
He sat in his armchair quite awkward with excitement and she quietly went on with her baking
Only by the careful way in which she did things could it be told how much moved she was
The clock ticked on
What time dost say hes coming
Morel asked for the fifth time
The train gets in at halfpast six she replied emphatically
Then hell be here at ten past seven
Eh bless you itll be hours late on the Midland she said indifferently
But she hoped by expecting him late to bring him early
Morel went down the entry to look for him
Then he came back
Goodness man
she said
Youre like an illsitting hen
Hadna you better be gettin him summat t eat ready
asked the father
Theres plenty of time she answered
Theres not so much as I can see on he answered turning crossly in his chair
She began to clear her table
The kettle was singing
They waited and waited
Meantime the three children were on the platform at Sethley Bridge on the Midland main line two miles from home
They waited one hour
A train camehe was not there
Down the line the red and green lights shone
It was very dark and very cold
Ask him if the London trains come said Paul to Annie when they saw a man in a tip cap
Im not said Annie
You be quiethe might send us off
But Paul was dying for the man to know they were expecting someone by the London train it sounded so grand
Yet he was much too much scared of broaching any man let alone one in a peaked cap to dare to ask
The three children could scarcely go into the waitingroom for fear of being sent away and for fear something should happen whilst they were off the platform
Still they waited in the dark and cold
Its an hour an a half late said Arthur pathetically
Well said Annie its Christmas Eve
They all grew silent
He wasnt coming
They looked down the darkness of the railway
There was London
It seemed the uttermost of distance
They thought anything might happen if one came from London
They were all too troubled to talk
Cold and unhappy and silent they huddled together on the platform
At last after more than two hours they saw the lights of an engine peering round away down the darkness
A porter ran out
The children drew back with beating hearts
A great train bound for Manchester drew up
Two doors opened and from one of them William
They flew to him
He handed parcels to them cheerily and immediately began to explain that this great train had stopped for HIS sake at such a small station as Sethley Bridge it was not booked to stop
Meanwhile the parents were getting anxious
The table was set the chop was cooked everything was ready
Mrs Morel put on her black apron
She was wearing her best dress
Then she sat pretending to read
The minutes were a torture to her
Hm
said Morel
Its an hour an a haef
And those children waiting
she said
Th train canna ha come in yet he said
I tell you on Christmas Eve theyre HOURS wrong
They were both a bit cross with each other so gnawed with anxiety
The ash tree moaned outside in a cold raw wind
And all that space of night from London home
Mrs Morel suffered
The slight click of the works inside the clock irritated her
It was getting so late it was getting unbearable
At last there was a sound of voices and a footstep in the entry
Has here
cried Morel jumping up
Then he stood back
The mother ran a few steps towards the door and waited
There was a rush and a patter of feet the door burst open
William was there
He dropped his Gladstone bag and took his mother in his arms
Mater
he said
My boy
she cried
And for two seconds no longer she clasped him and kissed him
Then she withdrew and said trying to be quite normal But how late you are
Arent I
he cried turning to his father
Well dad
The two men shook hands
Well my lad
Morels eyes were wet
We thought thad niver be commin he said
Oh Id come
exclaimed William
Then the son turned round to his mother
But you look well she said proudly laughing
Well
he exclaimed
I should think socoming home
He was a fine fellow big straight and fearlesslooking
He looked round at the evergreens and the kissing bunch and the little tarts that lay in their tins on the hearth
By jove
mother its not different
he said as if in relief
Everybody was still for a second
Then he suddenly sprang forward picked a tart from the hearth and pushed it whole into his mouth
Well did iver you see such a parish oven
the father exclaimed
He had brought them endless presents
Every penny he had he had spent on them
There was a sense of luxury overflowing in the house
For his mother there was an umbrella with gold on the pale handle
She kept it to her dying day and would have lost anything rather than that
Everybody had something gorgeous and besides there were pounds of unknown sweets Turkish delight crystallised pineapple and suchlike things which the children thought only the splendour of London could provide
And Paul boasted of these sweets among his friends
Real pineapple cut off in slices and then turned into crystalfair grand
Everybody was mad with happiness in the family
Home was home and they loved it with a passion of love whatever the suffering had been
There were parties there were rejoicings
People came in to see William to see what difference London had made to him
And they all found him such a gentleman and SUCH a fine fellow my word
When he went away again the children retired to various places to weep alone
Morel went to bed in misery and Mrs Morel felt as if she were numbed by some drug as if her feelings were paralysed
She loved him passionately
He was in the office of a lawyer connected with a large shipping firm and at the midsummer his chief offered him a trip in the Mediterranean on one of the boats for quite a small cost
Mrs Morel wrote Go go my boy
You may never have a chance again and I should love to think of you cruising there in the Mediterranean almost better than to have you at home
But William came home for his fortnights holiday
Not even the Mediterranean which pulled at all his young mans desire to travel and at his poor mans wonder at the glamorous south could take him away when he might come home
That compensated his mother for much
CHAPTER V PAUL LAUNCHES INTO LIFE MOREL was rather a heedless man careless of danger
So he had endless accidents
Now when Mrs Morel heard the rattle of an empty coalcart cease at her entryend she ran into the parlour to look expecting almost to see her husband seated in the waggon his face grey under his dirt his body limp and sick with some hurt or other
If it were he she would run out to help
About a year after William went to London and just after Paul had left school before he got work Mrs Morel was upstairs and her son was painting in the kitchenhe was very clever with his brushwhen there came a knock at the door
Crossly he put down his brush to go
At the same moment his mother opened a window upstairs and looked down
A pitlad in his dirt stood on the threshold
Is this Walter Morels
he asked
Yes said Mrs Morel
What is it
But she had guessed already
Your mesters got hurt he said
Eh dear me
she exclaimed
Its a wonder if he hadnt lad
And whats he done this time
I dont know for sure but its is leg somewhere
They taein im ter th ospital
Good gracious me
she exclaimed
Eh dear what a one he is
Theres not five minutes of peace Ill be hanged if there is
His thumbs nearly better and now Did you see him
I seed him at th bottom
An I seed em bring im up in a tub an e wor in a dead faint
But he shouted like anythink when Doctor Fraser examined him i th lamp cabinan cossed an swore an said as e wor goin to be taen whoame wornt goin ter th ospital
The boy faltered to an end
He WOULD want to come home so that I can have all the bother
Thank you my lad
Eh dear if Im not sicksick and surfeited I am
She came downstairs
Paul had mechanically resumed his painting
And it must be pretty bad if theyve taken him to the hospital she went on
But what a CARELESS creature he is
OTHER men dont have all these accidents
Yes he WOULD want to put all the burden on me
Eh dear just as we WERE getting easy a bit at last
Put those things away theres no time to be painting now
What time is there a train
I know I sll have to go trailing to Keston
I sll have to leave that bedroom
I can finish it said Paul
You neednt
I shall catch the seven oclock back I should think
Oh my blessed heart the fuss and commotion hell make
And those granite setts at Tinder Hillhe might well call them kidney pebblestheyll jolt him almost to bits
I wonder why they cant mend them the state theyre in an all the men as go across in that ambulance
Youd think theyd have a hospital here
The men bought the ground and my sirs thered be accidents enough to keep it going
But no they must trail them ten miles in a slow ambulance to Nottingham
Its a crying shame
Oh and the fuss hell make
I know he will
I wonder whos with him
Barker I sd think
Poor beggar hell wish himself anywhere rather
But hell look after him I know
Now theres no telling how long hell be stuck in that hospitaland WONT he hate it
But if its only his leg its not so bad
All the time she was getting ready
Hurriedly taking off her bodice she crouched at the boiler while the water ran slowly into her ladingcan
I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea
she exclaimed wriggling the handle impatiently
She had very handsome strong arms rather surprising on a smallish woman
Paul cleared away put on the kettle and set the table
There isnt a train till fourtwenty he said
Youve time enough
Oh no I havent
she cried blinking at him over the towel as she wiped her face
Yes you have
You must drink a cup of tea at any rate
Should I come with you to Keston
Come with me
What for I should like to know
Now what have I to take him
Eh dear
His clean shirtand its a blessing it IS clean
But it had better be aired
And stockingshe wont want themand a towel I suppose and handkerchiefs
Now what else
A comb a knife and fork and spoon said Paul
His father had been in the hospital before
Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in continued Mrs Morel as she combed her long brown hair that was fine as silk and was touched now with grey
Hes very particular to wash himself to the waist but below he thinks doesnt matter
But there I suppose they see plenty like it
Paul had laid the table
He cut his mother one or two pieces of very thin bread and butter
Here you are he said putting her cup of tea in her place
I cant be bothered
she exclaimed crossly
Well youve got to so there now its put out ready he insisted
So she sat down and sipped her tea and ate a little in silence
She was thinking
In a few minutes she was gone to walk the two and a half miles to Keston Station
All the things she was taking him she had in her bulging string bag
Paul watched her go up the road between the hedgesa little quickstepping figure and his heart ached for her that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble
And she tripping so quickly in her anxiety felt at the back of her her sons heart waiting on her felt him bearing what part of the burden he could even supporting her
And when she was at the hospital she thought It WILL upset that lad when I tell him how bad it is
Id better be careful
And when she was trudging home again she felt he was coming to share her burden
Is it bad
asked Paul as soon as she entered the house
Its bad enough she replied
What
She sighed and sat down undoing her bonnetstrings
Her son watched her face as it was lifted and her small workhardened hands fingering at the bow under her chin
Well she answered its not really dangerous but the nurse says its a dreadful smash
You see a great piece of rock fell on his leghereand its a compound fracture
There are pieces of bone sticking through Ughhow horrid
exclaimed the children
And she continued of course he says hes going to dieit wouldnt be him if he didnt
Im done for my lass
he said looking at me
Dont be so silly I said to him
Youre not going to die of a broken leg however badly its smashed
I sll niver come out of ere but in a wooden box he groaned
Well I said if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box when youre better Ive no doubt they will
If we think its good for him said the Sister
Shes an awfully nice Sister but rather strict
Mrs Morel took off her bonnet
The children waited in silence
Of course he IS bad she continued and he will be
Its a great shock and hes lost a lot of blood and of course it IS a very dangerous smash
Its not at all sure that it will mend so easily
And then theres the fever and the mortificationif it took bad ways hed quickly be gone
But there hes a cleanblooded man with wonderful healing flesh and so I see no reason why it SHOULD take bad ways
Of course theres a wound She was pale now with emotion and anxiety
The three children realised that it was very bad for their father and the house was silent anxious
But he always gets better said Paul after a while
Thats what I tell him said the mother
Everybody moved about in silence
And he really looked nearly done for she said
But the Sister says that is the pain
Annie took away her mothers coat and bonnet
And he looked at me when I came away
I said I sll have to go now Walter because of the trainand the children
And he looked at me
It seems hard
Paul took up his brush again and went on painting
Arthur went outside for some coal
Annie sat looking dismal
And Mrs Morel in her little rockingchair that her husband had made for her when the first baby was coming remained motionless brooding
She was grieved and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much
But still in her heart of hearts where the love should have burned there was a blank
Now when all her womans pity was roused to its full extent when she would have slaved herself to death to nurse him and to save him when she would have taken the pain herself if she could somewhere far away inside her she felt indifferent to him and to his suffering
It hurt her most of all this failure to love him even when he roused her strong emotions
She brooded a while
And there she said suddenly when Id got halfway to Keston I found Id come out in my working bootsand LOOK at them
They were an old pair of Pauls brown and rubbed through at the toes
I didnt know what to do with myself for shame she added
In the morning when Annie and Arthur were at school Mrs Morel talked again to her son who was helping her with her housework
I found Barker at the hospital
He did look bad poor little fellow
Well I said to him what sort of a journey did you have with him
Dunna ax me missis
he said
Ay I said I know what hed be
But it WOR bad for him Mrs Morel it WOR that
he said
I know I said
At ivry jolt I thought my eart would ha flown clean out o my mouth he said
An the scream e gives sometimes
Missis not for a fortune would I go through wi it again
I can quite understand it I said
Its a nasty job though he said an one asll be a long while afore its right again
Im afraid it will I said
I like Mr BarkerI DO like him
Theres something so manly about him
Paul resumed his task silently
And of course Mrs Morel continued for a man like your father the hospital IS hard
He CANT understand rules and regulations
And he wont let anybody else touch him not if he can help it
When he smashed the muscles of his thigh and it had to be dressed four times a day WOULD he let anybody but me or his mother do it
He wouldnt
So of course hell suffer in there with the nurses
And I didnt like leaving him
Im sure when I kissed him an came away it seemed a shame
So she talked to her son almost as if she were thinking aloud to him and he took it in as best he could by sharing her trouble to lighten it
And in the end she shared almost everything with him without knowing
Morel had a very bad time
For a week he was in a critical condition
Then he began to mend
And then knowing he was going to get better the whole family sighed with relief and proceeded to live happily
They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital
There were fourteen shillings a week from the pit ten shillings from the sick club and five shillings from the Disability Fund and then every week the butties had something for Mrs Morelfive or seven shillingsso that she was quite well to do
And whilst Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital the family was extraordinarily happy and peaceful
On Saturdays and Wednesdays Mrs Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband
Then she always brought back some little thing a small tube of paints for Paul or some thick paper a couple of postcards for Annie that the whole family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed to send them away or a fretsaw for Arthur or a bit of pretty wood
She described her adventures into the big shops with joy
Soon the folk in the pictureshop knew her and knew about Paul
The girl in the bookshop took a keen interest in her
Mrs Morel was full of information when she got home from Nottingham
The three sat round till bedtime listening putting in arguing
Then Paul often raked the fire
Im the man in the house now he used to say to his mother with joy
They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be
And they almost regrettedthough none of them would have owned to such callousnessthat their father was soon coming back
Paul was now fourteen and was looking for work
He was a rather small and rather finelymade boy with dark brown hair and light blue eyes
His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness and was becoming somewhat like Williamsroughfeatured almost ruggedand it was extraordinarily mobile
Usually he looked as if he saw things was full of life and warm then his smile like his mothers came suddenly and was very lovable and then when there was any clog in his souls quick running his face went stupid and ugly
He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown and a lout as soon as he is not understood or feels himself held cheap and again is adorable at the first touch of warmth
He suffered very much from the first contact with anything
When he was seven the starting school had been a nightmare and a torture to him
But afterwards he liked it
And now that he felt he had to go out into life he went through agonies of shrinking selfconsciousness
He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his years and he knew some French and German and mathematics that Mr Heaton had taught him
But nothing he had was of any commercial value
He was not strong enough for heavy manual work his mother said
He did not care for making things with his hands preferred racing about or making excursions into the country or reading or painting
What do you want to be
his mother asked
Anything
That is no answer said Mrs Morel
But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give
His ambition as far as this worlds gear went was quietly to earn his thirty or thirtyfive shillings a week somewhere near home and then when his father died have a cottage with his mother paint and go out as he liked and live happy ever after
That was his programme as far as doing things went
But he was proud within himself measuring people against himself and placing them inexorably
And he thought that PERHAPS he might also make a painter the real thing
But that he left alone
Then said his mother you must look in the paper for the advertisements
He looked at her
It seemed to him a bitter humiliation and an anguish to go through
But he said nothing
When he got up in the morning his whole being was knotted up over this one thought Ive got to go and look for advertisements for a job
It stood in front of the morning that thought killing all joy and even life for him
His heart felt like a tight knot
And then at ten oclock he set off
He was supposed to be a queer quiet child
Going up the sunny street of the little town he felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves Hes going to the Coop
readingroom to look in the papers for a place
He cant get a job
I suppose hes living on his mother
Then he crept up the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Coop and peeped in the readingroom
Usually one or two men were there either old useless fellows or colliers on the club
So he entered full of shrinking and suffering when they looked up seated himself at the table and pretended to scan the news
He knew they would think What does a lad of thirteen want in a readingroom with a newspaper
and he suffered
Then he looked wistfully out of the window
Already he was a prisoner of industrialism
Large sunflowers stared over the old red wall of the garden opposite looking in their jolly way down on the women who were hurrying with something for dinner
The valley was full of corn brightening in the sun
Two collieries among the fields waved their small white plumes of steam
Far off on the hills were the woods of Annesley dark and fascinating
Already his heart went down
He was being taken into bondage
His freedom in the beloved home valley was going now
The brewers waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous barrels four a side like beans in a burst beanpod
The waggoner throned aloft rolling massively in his seat was not so much below Pauls eye
The mans hair on his small bullet head was bleached almost white by the sun and on his thick red arms rocking idly on his sack apron the white hairs glistened
His red face shone and was almost asleep with sunshine
The horses handsome and brown went on by themselves looking by far the masters of the show
Paul wished he were stupid
I wish he thought to himself I was fat like him and like a dog in the sun
I wish I was a pig and a brewers waggoner
Then the room being at last empty he would hastily copy an advertisement on a scrap of paper then another and slip out in immense relief
His mother would scan over his copies
Yes she said you may try
William had written out a letter of application couched in admirable business language which Paul copied with variations
The boys handwriting was execrable so that William who did all things well got into a fever of impatience
The elder brother was becoming quite swanky
In London he found that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood friends in station
Some of the clerks in the office had studied for the law and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship
William always made friends among men wherever he went he was so jolly
Therefore he was soon visiting and staying in houses of men who in Bestwood would have looked down on the unapproachable bank manager and would merely have called indifferently on the Rector
So he began to fancy himself as a great gun
He was indeed rather surprised at the ease with which he became a gentleman
His mother was glad he seemed so pleased
And his lodging in Walthamstow was so dreary
But now there seemed to come a kind of fever into the young mans letters
He was unsettled by all the change he did not stand firm on his own feet but seemed to spin rather giddily on the quick current of the new life
His mother was anxious for him
She could feel him losing himself
He had danced and gone to the theatre boated on the river been out with friends and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom grinding away at Latin because he intended to get on in his office and in the law as much as he could
He never sent his mother any money now
It was all taken the little he had for his own life
And she did not want any except sometimes when she was in a tight corner and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry
She still dreamed of William and of what he would do with herself behind him
Never for a minute would she admit to herself how heavy and anxious her heart was because of him
Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance a handsome brunette quite young and a lady after whom the men were running thick and fast
I wonder if you would run my boy his mother wrote to him unless you saw all the other men chasing her too
You feel safe enough and vain enough in a crowd
But take care and see how you feel when you find yourself alone and in triumph
William resented these things and continued the chase
He had taken the girl on the river
If you saw her mother you would know how I feel
Tall and elegant with the clearest of clear transparent olive complexions hair as black as jet and such grey eyesbright mocking like lights on water at night
It is all very well to be a bit satirical till you see her
And she dresses as well as any woman in London
I tell you your son doesnt half put his head up when she goes walking down Piccadilly with him
Mrs Morel wondered in her heart if her son did not go walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes rather than with a woman who was near to him
But she congratulated him in her doubtful fashion
And as she stood over the washingtub the mother brooded over her son
She saw him saddled with an elegant and expensive wife earning little money dragging along and getting draggled in some small ugly house in a suburb
But there she told herself I am very likely a sillymeeting trouble halfway
Nevertheless the load of anxiety scarcely ever left her heart lest William should do the wrong thing by himself
Presently Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances at 21 Spaniel Row Nottingham
Mrs Morel was all joy
There you see
she cried her eyes shining
Youve only written four letters and the third is answered
Youre lucky my boy as I always said you were
Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg adorned with elastic stockings and other appliances that figured on Mr Jordans notepaper and he felt alarmed
He had not known that elastic stockings existed
And he seemed to feel the business world with its regulated system of values and its impersonality and he dreaded it
It seemed monstrous also that a business could be run on wooden legs
Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning
It was August and blazing hot
Paul walked with something screwed up tight inside him
He would have suffered much physical pain rather than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers to be accepted or rejected
Yet he chattered away with his mother
He would never have confessed to her how he suffered over these things and she only partly guessed
She was gay like a sweetheart
She stood in front of the ticketoffice at Bestwood and Paul watched her take from her purse the money for the tickets
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting the silver out of the worn purse his heart contracted with pain of love of her
She was quite excited and quite gay
He suffered because she WOULD talk aloud in presence of the other travellers
Now look at that silly cow
she said careering round as if it thought it was a circus
Its most likely a bottfly he said very low
A what
she asked brightly and unashamed
They thought a while
He was sensible all the time of having her opposite him
Suddenly their eyes met and she smiled to hima rare intimate smile beautiful with brightness and love
Then each looked out of the window
The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed
The mother and son walked down Station Street feeling the excitement of lovers having an adventure together
In Carrington Street they stopped to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal below
Its just like Venice he said seeing the sunshine on the water that lay between high factory walls
Perhaps she answered smiling
They enjoyed the shops immensely
Now you see that blouse she would say wouldnt that just suit our Annie
And for oneandeleventhree
Isnt that cheap
And made of needlework as well he said
Yes
They had plenty of time so they did not hurry
The town was strange and delightful to them
But the boy was tied up inside in a knot of apprehension
He dreaded the interview with Thomas Jordan
It was nearly eleven oclock by St Peters Church
They turned up a narrow street that led to the Castle
It was gloomy and oldfashioned having low dark shops and dark green house doors with brass knockers and yellowochred doorsteps projecting on to the pavement then another old shop whose small window looked like a cunning halfshut eye
Mother and son went cautiously looking everywhere for Thomas Jordan and Son
It was like hunting in some wild place
They were on tiptoe of excitement
Suddenly they spied a big dark archway in which were names of various firms Thomas Jordan among them
Here it is
said Mrs Morel
But now WHERE is it
They looked round
On one side was a queer dark cardboard factory on the other a Commercial Hotel
Its up the entry said Paul
And they ventured under the archway as into the jaws of the dragon
They emerged into a wide yard like a well with buildings all round
It was littered with straw and boxes and cardboard
The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold
But elsewhere the place was like a pit
There were several doors and two flights of steps
Straight in front on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase loomed the ominous words Thomas Jordan and SonSurgical Appliances
Mrs Morel went first her son followed her
Charles I mounted his scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed his mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door
She pushed open the door and stood in pleased surprise
In front of her was a big warehouse with creamy paper parcels everywhere and clerks with their shirtsleeves rolled back were going about in an athome sort of way
The light was subdued the glossy cream parcels seemed luminous the counters were of dark brown wood
All was quiet and very homely
Mrs Morel took two steps forward then waited
Paul stood behind her
She had on her Sunday bonnet and a black veil he wore a boys broad white collar and a Norfolk suit
One of the clerks looked up
He was thin and tall with a small face
His way of looking was alert
Then he glanced round to the other end of the room where was a glass office
And then he came forward
He did not say anything but leaned in a gentle inquiring fashion towards Mrs Morel
Can I see Mr
Jordan
she asked
Ill fetch him answered the young man
He went down to the glass office
A redfaced whitewhiskered old man looked up
He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog
Then the same little man came up the room
He had short legs was rather stout and wore an alpaca jacket
So with one ear up as it were he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room
Goodmorning
he said hesitating before Mrs Morel in doubt as to whether she were a customer or not
Goodmorning
I came with my son Paul Morel
You asked him to call this morning
Come this way said Mr Jordan in a rather snappy little manner intended to be businesslike
They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room upholstered in black American leather glossy with the rubbing of many customers
On the table was a pile of trusses yellow washleather hoops tangled together
They looked new and living
Paul sniffed the odour of new washleather
He wondered what the things were
By this time he was so much stunned that he only noticed the outside things
Sit down
said Mr Jordan irritably pointing Mrs Morel to a horsehair chair
She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion
Then the little old man fidgeted and found a paper
Did you write this letter
he snapped thrusting what Paul recognised as his own notepaper in front of him
Yes he answered
At that moment he was occupied in two ways first in feeling guilty for telling a lie since William had composed the letter second in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different in the fat red hand of the man from what it had been when it lay on the kitchen table
It was like part of himself gone astray
He resented the way the man held it
Where did you learn to write
said the old man crossly
Paul merely looked at him shamedly and did not answer
He IS a bad writer put in Mrs Morel apologetically
Then she pushed up her veil
Paul hated her for not being prouder with this common little man and he loved her face clear of the veil
And you say you know French
inquired the little man still sharply
Yes said Paul
What school did you go to
The Boardschool
And did you learn it there
NoI The boy went crimson and got no farther
His godfather gave him lessons said Mrs Morel half pleading and rather distant
Mr Jordan hesitated
Then in his irritable mannerhe always seemed to keep his hands ready for actionhe pulled another sheet of paper from his pocket unfolded it
The paper made a crackling noise
He handed it to Paul
Read that he said
It was a note in French in thin flimsy foreign handwriting that the boy could not decipher
He stared blankly at the paper
Monsieur he began then he looked in great confusion at Mr Jordan
Its theits the He wanted to say handwriting but his wits would no longer work even sufficiently to supply him with the word
Feeling an utter fool and hating Mr Jordan he turned desperately to the paper again
SirPlease send meererI cant tell theertwo pairsgris fil basgrey thread stockingserersanswithout erI cant tell the wordserdoigtsfingerserI cant tell the He wanted to say handwriting but the word still refused to come
Seeing him stuck Mr Jordan snatched the paper from him
Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings without TOES
Well flashed Paul doigts means fingersas wellas a rule The little man looked at him
He did not know whether doigts meant fingers he knew that for all HIS purposes it meant toes
Fingers to stockings
he snapped
Well it DOES mean fingers the boy persisted
He hated the little man who made such a clod of him
Mr Jordan looked at the pale stupid defiant boy then at the mother who sat quiet and with that peculiar shutoff look of the poor who have to depend on the favour of others
And when could he come
he asked
Well said Mrs Morel as soon as you wish
He has finished school now
He would live in Bestwood
Yes but he could be inat the stationat quarter to eight
Hm
It ended by Pauls being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight shillings a week
The boy did not open his mouth to say another word after having insisted that doigts meant fingers
He followed his mother down the stairs
She looked at him with her bright blue eyes full of love and joy
I think youll like it she said
Doigts does mean fingers mother and it was the writing
I couldnt read the writing
Never mind my boy
Im sure hell be all right and you wont see much of him
Wasnt that first young fellow nice
Im sure youll like them
But wasnt Mr Jordan common mother
Does he own it all
I suppose he was a workman who has got on she said
You mustnt mind people so much
Theyre not being disagreeable to YOUits their way
You always think people are meaning things for you
But they dont
It was very sunny
Over the big desolate space of the marketplace the blue sky shimmered and the granite cobbles of the paving glistened
Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity and the shadow was full of colour
Just where the horse trams trundled across the market was a row of fruit stalls with fruit blazing in the sunapples and piles of reddish oranges small greengage plums and bananas
There was a warm scent of fruit as mother and son passed
Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of rage sank
Where should we go for dinner
asked the mother
It was felt to be a reckless extravagance
Paul had only been in an eatinghouse once or twice in his life and then only to have a cup of tea and a bun
Most of the people of Bestwood considered that tea and breadandbutter and perhaps potted beef was all they could afford to eat in Nottingham
Real cooked dinner was considered great extravagance
Paul felt rather guilty
They found a place that looked quite cheap
But when Mrs Morel scanned the bill of fare her heart was heavy things were so dear
So she ordered kidneypies and potatoes as the cheapest available dish
We oughtnt to have come here mother said Paul
Never mind she said
We wont come again
She insisted on his having a small currant tart because he liked sweets
I dont want it mother he pleaded
Yes she insisted youll have it
And she looked round for the waitress
But the waitress was busy and Mrs Morel did not like to bother her then
So the mother and son waited for the girls pleasure whilst she flirted among the men
Brazen hussy
said Mrs Morel to Paul
Look now shes taking that man HIS pudding and he came long after us
It doesnt matter mother said Paul
Mrs Morel was angry
But she was too poor and her orders were too meagre so that she had not the courage to insist on her rights just then
They waited and waited
Should we go mother
he said
Then Mrs Morel stood up
The girl was passing near
Will you bring one currant tart
said Mrs Morel clearly
The girl looked round insolently
Directly she said
We have waited quite long enough said Mrs Morel
In a moment the girl came back with the tart
Mrs Morel asked coldly for the bill
Paul wanted to sink through the floor
He marvelled at his mothers hardness
He knew that only years of battling had taught her to insist even so little on her rights
She shrank as much as he
Its the last time I go THERE for anything
she declared when they were outside the place thankful to be clear
Well go she said and look at Keeps and Boots and one or two places shall we
They had discussions over the pictures and Mrs Morel wanted to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after
But this indulgence he refused
He stood in front of milliners shops and drapers shops almost bored but content for her to be interested
They wandered on
Now just look at those black grapes
she said
They make your mouth water
Ive wanted some of those for years but I sll have to wait a bit before I get them
Then she rejoiced in the florists standing in the doorway sniffing
Oh
oh
Isnt it simply lovely
Paul saw in the darkness of the shop an elegant young lady in black peering over the counter curiously
Theyre looking at you he said trying to draw his mother away
But what is it
she exclaimed refusing to be moved
Stocks
he answered sniffing hastily
Look theres a tubful
So there isred and white
But really I never knew stocks to smell like it
And to his great relief she moved out of the doorway but only to stand in front of the window
Paul
she cried to him who was trying to get out of sight of the elegant young lady in blackthe shopgirl
Paul
Just look here
He came reluctantly back
Now just look at that fuchsia
she exclaimed pointing
Hm
He made a curious interested sound
Youd think every second as the flowers was going to fall off they hang so big an heavy
And such an abundance
she cried
And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots
Yes
she exclaimed
Lovely
I wonder wholl buy it
he said
I wonder
she answered
Not us
It would die in our parlour
Yes beastly cold sunless hole it kills every bit of a plant you put in and the kitchen chokes them to death
They bought a few things and set off towards the station
Looking up the canal through the dark pass of the buildings they saw the Castle on its bluff of brown greenbushed rock in a positive miracle of delicate sunshine
Wont it be nice for me to come out at dinnertimes
said Paul
I can go all round here and see everything
I sll love it
You will assented his mother
He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother
They arrived home in the mellow evening happy and glowing and tired
In the morning he filled in the form for his seasonticket and took it to the station
When he got back his mother was just beginning to wash the floor
He sat crouched up on the sofa
He says itll be here on Saturday he said
And how much will it be
About one pound eleven he said
She went on washing her floor in silence
Is it a lot
he asked
Its no more than I thought she answered
An I sll earn eight shillings a week he said
She did not answer but went on with her work
At last she said That William promised me when he went to London as hed give me a pound a month
He has given me ten shillingstwice and now I know he hasnt a farthing if I asked him
Not that I want it
Only just now youd think he might be able to help with this ticket which Id never expected
He earns a lot said Paul
He earns a hundred and thirty pounds
But theyre all alike
Theyre large in promises but its precious little fulfilment you get
He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself said Paul
And I keep this house on less than thirty she replied and am supposed to find money for extras
But they dont care about helping you once theyve gone
Hed rather spend it on that dressedup creature
She should have her own money if shes so grand said Paul
She should but she hasnt
I asked him
And I know he doesnt buy her a gold bangle for nothing
I wonder whoever bought ME a gold bangle
William was succeeding with his Gipsy as he called her
He asked the girlher name was Louisa Lily Denys Westernfor a photograph to send to his mother
The photo camea handsome brunette taken in profile smirking slightlyand it might be quite naked for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be seen only a naked bust
Yes wrote Mrs Morel to her son the photograph of Louie is very striking and I can see she must be attractive
But do you think my boy it was very good taste of a girl to give her young man that photo to send to his motherthe first
Certainly the shoulders are beautiful as you say
But I hardly expected to see so much of them at the first view
Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in the parlour
He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger
Who dost reckon this is
he asked of his wife
Its the girl our William is going with replied Mrs Morel
Hm
Ers a bright spark from th look on er an one as wunna do him owermuch good neither
Who is she
Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western
An come again tomorrer
exclaimed the miner
An is er an actress
She is not
Shes supposed to be a lady
Ill bet
he exclaimed still staring at the photo
A lady is she
An how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o game on
On nothing
She lives with an old aunt whom she hates and takes what bit of moneys given her
Hm
said Morel laying down the photograph
Then hes a fool to ha taen up wi such a one as that
Dear Mater William replied
Im sorry you didnt like the photograph
It never occurred to me when I sent it that you mightnt think it decent
However I told Gyp that it didnt quite suit your prim and proper notions so shes going to send you another that I hope will please you better
Shes always being photographed in fact the photographers ask her if they may take her for nothing
Presently the new photograph came with a little silly note from the girl
This time the young lady was seen in a black satin evening bodice cut square with little puff sleeves and black lace hanging down her beautiful arms
I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes said Mrs Morel sarcastically
Im sure I ought to be impressed
You are disagreeable mother said Paul
I think the first one with bare shoulders is lovely
Do you
answered his mother
Well I dont
On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work
He had the seasonticket which had cost such bitterness in his waistcoat pocket
He loved it with its bars of yellow across
His mother packed his dinner in a small shutup basket and he set off at a quarter to seven to catch the 715 train
Mrs Morel came to the entryend to see him off
It was a perfect morning
From the ash tree the slender green fruits that the children call pigeons were twinkling gaily down on a little breeze into the front gardens of the houses
The valley was full of a lustrous dark haze through which the ripe corn shimmered and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly
Puffs of wind came
Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley where the country gleamed and home had never pulled at him so powerfully
Goodmorning mother he said smiling but feeling very unhappy
Goodmorning she replied cheerfully and tenderly
She stood in her white apron on the open road watching him as he crossed the field
He had a small compact body that looked full of life
She felt as she saw him trudging over the field that where he determined to go he would get
She thought of William
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile
He was away in London doing well
Paul would be working in Nottingham
Now she had two sons in the world
She could think of two places great centres of industry and feel that she had put a man into each of them that these men would work out what SHE wanted they were derived from her they were of her and their works also would be hers
All the morning long she thought of Paul
At eight oclock he climbed the dismal stairs of Jordans Surgical Appliance Factory and stood helplessly against the first great parcelrack waiting for somebody to pick him up
The place was still not awake
Over the counters were great dust sheets
Two men only had arrived and were heard talking in a corner as they took off their coats and rolled up their shirtsleeves
It was ten past eight
Evidently there was no rush of punctuality
Paul listened to the voices of the two clerks
Then he heard someone cough and saw in the office at the end of the room an old decaying clerk in a round smokingcap of black velvet embroidered with red and green opening letters
He waited and waited
One of the junior clerks went to the old man greeted him cheerily and loudly
Evidently the old chief was deaf
Then the young fellow came striding importantly down to his counter
He spied Paul
Hello
he said
You the new lad
Yes said Paul
Hm
Whats your name
Paul Morel
Paul Morel
All right you come on round here
Paul followed him round the rectangle of counters
The room was second storey
It had a great hole in the middle of the floor fenced as with a wall of counters and down this wide shaft the lifts went and the light for the bottom storey
Also there was a corresponding big oblong hole in the ceiling and one could see above over the fence of the top floor some machinery and right away overhead was the glass roof and all light for the three storeys came downwards getting dimmer so that it was always night on the ground floor and rather gloomy on the second floor
The factory was the top floor the warehouse the second the storehouse the ground floor
It was an insanitary ancient place
Paul was led round to a very dark corner
This is the Spiral corner said the clerk
Youre Spiral with Pappleworth
Hes your boss but hes not come yet
He doesnt get here till halfpast eight
So you can fetch the letters if you like from Mr Melling down there
The young man pointed to the old clerk in the office
All right said Paul
Heres a peg to hang your cap on
Here are your entry ledgers
Mr Pappleworth wont be long
And the thin young man stalked away with long busy strides over the hollow wooden floor
After a minute or two Paul went down and stood in the door of the glass office
The old clerk in the smokingcap looked down over the rim of his spectacles
Goodmorning he said kindly and impressively
You want the letters for the Spiral department Thomas
Paul resented being called Thomas
But he took the letters and returned to his dark place where the counter made an angle where the great parcelrack came to an end and where there were three doors in the corner
He sat on a high stool and read the lettersthose whose handwriting was not too difficult
They ran as follows Will you please send me at once a pair of ladys silk spiral thighhose without feet such as I had from you last year length thigh to knee etc
Or Major Chamberlain wishes to repeat his previous order for a silk nonelastic suspensory bandage
Many of these letters some of them in French or Norwegian were a great puzzle to the boy
He sat on his stool nervously awaiting the arrival of his boss
He suffered tortures of shyness when at halfpast eight the factory girls for upstairs trooped past him
Mr Pappleworth arrived chewing a chlorodyne gum at about twenty to nine when all the other men were at work
He was a thin sallow man with a red nose quick staccato and smartly but stiffly dressed
He was about thirtysix years old
There was something rather doggy rather smart rather cute and shrewd and something warm and something slightly contemptible about him
You my new lad
he said
Paul stood up and said he was
Fetched the letters
Mr Pappleworth gave a chew to his gum
Yes
Copied em
No
Well come on then lets look slippy
Changed your coat
No
You want to bring an old coat and leave it here
He pronounced the last words with the chlorodyne gum between his side teeth
He vanished into the darkness behind the great parcelrack reappeared coatless turning up a smart striped shirtcuff over a thin and hairy arm
Then he slipped into his coat
Paul noticed how thin he was and that his trousers were in folds behind
He seized a stool dragged it beside the boys and sat down
Sit down he said
Paul took a seat
Mr Pappleworth was very close to him
The man seized the letters snatched a long entrybook out of a rack in front of him flung it open seized a pen and said Now look here
You want to copy these letters in here
He sniffed twice gave a quick chew at his gum stared fixedly at a letter then went very still and absorbed and wrote the entry rapidly in a beautiful flourishing hand
He glanced quickly at Paul
See that
Yes
Think you can do it all right
Yes
All right then lets see you
He sprang off his stool
Paul took a pen
Mr Pappleworth disappeared
Paul rather liked copying the letters but he wrote slowly laboriously and exceedingly badly
He was doing the fourth letter and feeling quite busy and happy when Mr Pappleworth reappeared
Now then howr yer getting on
Done em
He leaned over the boys shoulder chewing and smelling of chlorodyne
Strike my bob lad but youre a beautiful writer
he exclaimed satirically
Neer mind how many hyer done
Only three
Id a eaten em
Get on my lad an put numbers on em
Here look
Get on
Paul ground away at the letters whilst Mr Pappleworth fussed over various jobs
Suddenly the boy started as a shrill whistle sounded near his ear
Mr Pappleworth came took a plug out of a pipe and said in an amazingly cross and bossy voice Yes
Paul heard a faint voice like a womans out of the mouth of the tube
He gazed in wonder never having seen a speakingtube before
Well said Mr Pappleworth disagreeably into the tube youd better get some of your back work done then
Again the womans tiny voice was heard sounding pretty and cross
Ive not time to stand here while you talk said Mr Pappleworth and he pushed the plug into the tube
Come my lad he said imploringly to Paul theres Polly crying out for them orders
Cant you buck up a bit
Here come out
He took the book to Pauls immense chagrin and began the copying himself
He worked quickly and well
This done he seized some strips of long yellow paper about three inches wide and made out the days orders for the workgirls
Youd better watch me he said to Paul working all the while rapidly
Paul watched the weird little drawings of legs and thighs and ankles with the strokes across and the numbers and the few brief directions which his chief made upon the yellow paper
Then Mr Pappleworth finished and jumped up
Come on with me he said and the yellow papers flying in his hands he dashed through a door and down some stairs into the basement where the gas was burning
They crossed the cold damp storeroom then a long dreary room with a long table on trestles into a smaller cosy apartment not very high which had been built on to the main building
In this room a small woman with a red serge blouse and her black hair done on top of her head was waiting like a proud little bantam
Here yare
said Pappleworth
I think it is here you are
exclaimed Polly
The girls have been here nearly half an hour waiting
Just think of the time wasted
YOU think of getting your work done and not talking so much said Mr Pappleworth
You could ha been finishing off
You know quite well we finished everything off on Saturday
cried Pony flying at him her dark eyes flashing
Tututututerterter
he mocked
Heres your new lad
Dont ruin him as you did the last
As we did the last
repeated Polly
Yes WE do a lot of ruining we do
My word a lad would TAKE some ruining after hed been with you
Its time for work now not for talk said Mr Pappleworth severely and coldly
It was time for work some time back said Polly marching away with her head in the air
She was an erect little body of forty
In that room were two round spiral machines on the bench under the window
Through the inner doorway was another longer room with six more machines
A little group of girls nicely dressed in white aprons stood talking together
Have you nothing else to do but talk
said Mr Pappleworth
Only wait for you said one handsome girl laughing
Well get on get on he said
Come on my lad
Youll know your road down here again
And Paul ran upstairs after his chief
He was given some checking and invoicing to do
He stood at the desk labouring in his execrable handwriting
Presently Mr Jordan came strutting down from the glass office and stood behind him to the boys great discomfort
Suddenly a red and fat finger was thrust on the form he was filling in
MR J
A Bates Esquire
exclaimed the cross voice just behind his ear
Paul looked at Mr J
A Bates Esquire in his own vile writing and wondered what was the matter now
Didnt they teach you any better THAN that while they were at it
If you put Mr
you dont put Esquirea man cant be both at once
The boy regretted his toomuch generosity in disposing of honours hesitated and with trembling fingers scratched out the Mr Then all at once Mr Jordan snatched away the invoice
Make another
Are you going to send that to a gentleman
And he tore up the blue form irritably
Paul his ears red with shame began again
Still Mr Jordan watched
I dont know what they DO teach in schools
Youll have to write better than that
Lads learn nothing nowadays but how to recite poetry and play the fiddle
Have you seen his writing
he asked of Mr Pappleworth
Yes prime isnt it
replied Mr Pappleworth indifferently
Mr Jordan gave a little grunt not unamiable
Paul divined that his masters bark was worse than his bite
Indeed the little manufacturer although he spoke bad English was quite gentleman enough to leave his men alone and to take no notice of trifles
But he knew he did not look like the boss and owner of the show so he had to play his role of proprietor at first to put things on a right footing
Lets see WHATS your name
asked Mr Pappleworth of the boy
Paul Morel
It is curious that children suffer so much at having to pronounce their own names
Paul Morel is it
All right you PaulMorel through them things there and then Mr Pappleworth subsided on to a stool and began writing
A girl came up from out of a door just behind put some newlypressed elastic web appliances on the counter and returned
Mr Pappleworth picked up the whiteyblue kneeband examined it and its yellow orderpaper quickly and put it on one side
Next was a fleshpink leg
He went through the few things wrote out a couple of orders and called to Paul to accompany him
This time they went through the door whence the girl had emerged
There Paul found himself at the top of a little wooden flight of steps and below him saw a room with windows round two sides and at the farther end half a dozen girls sitting bending over the benches in the light from the window sewing
They were singing together Two Little Girls in Blue
Hearing the door opened they all turned round to see Mr Pappleworth and Paul looking down on them from the far end of the room
They stopped singing
Cant you make a bit less row
said Mr Pappleworth
Folkll think we keep cats
A hunchback woman on a high stool turned her long rather heavy face towards Mr Pappleworth and said in a contralto voice Theyre all tomcats then
In vain Mr Pappleworth tried to be impressive for Pauls benefit
He descended the steps into the finishingoff room and went to the hunchback Fanny
She had such a short body on her high stool that her head with its great bands of bright brown hair seemed over large as did her pale heavy face
She wore a dress of greenblack cashmere and her wrists coming out of the narrow cuffs were thin and flat as she put down her work nervously
He showed her something that was wrong with a kneecap
Well she said you neednt come blaming it on to me
Its not my fault
Her colour mounted to her cheek
I never said it WAS your fault
Will you do as I tell you
replied Mr Pappleworth shortly
You dont say its my fault but youd like to make out as it was the hunchback woman cried almost in tears
Then she snatched the kneecap from her boss saying Yes Ill do it for you but you neednt be snappy
Heres your new lad said Mr Pappleworth
Fanny turned smiling very gently on Paul
Oh
she said
Yes dont make a softy of him between you
Its not us as ud make a softy of him she said indignantly
Come on then Paul said Mr Pappleworth
Au revoy Paul said one of the girls
There was a titter of laughter
Paul went out blushing deeply not having spoken a word
The day was very long
All morning the workpeople were coming to speak to Mr Pappleworth
Paul was writing or learning to make up parcels ready for the midday post
At one oclock or rather at a quarter to one Mr Pappleworth disappeared to catch his train he lived in the suburbs
At one oclock Paul feeling very lost took his dinnerbasket down into the stockroom in the basement that had the long table on trestles and ate his meal hurriedly alone in that cellar of gloom and desolation
Then he went out of doors
The brightness and the freedom of the streets made him feel adventurous and happy
But at two oclock he was back in the corner of the big room
Soon the workgirls went trooping past making remarks
It was the commoner girls who worked upstairs at the heavy tasks of trussmaking and the finishing of artificial limbs
He waited for Mr Pappleworth not knowing what to do sitting scribbling on the yellow orderpaper
Mr Pappleworth came at twenty minutes to three
Then he sat and gossiped with Paul treating the boy entirely as an equal even in age
In the afternoon there was never very much to do unless it were near the weekend and the accounts had to be made up
At five oclock all the men went down into the dungeon with the table on trestles and there they had tea eating breadandbutter on the bare dirty boards talking with the same kind of ugly haste and slovenliness with which they ate their meal
And yet upstairs the atmosphere among them was always jolly and clear
The cellar and the trestles affected them
After tea when all the gases were lighted WORK went more briskly
There was the big evening post to get off
The hose came up warm and newly pressed from the workrooms
Paul had made out the invoices
Now he had the packing up and addressing to do then he had to weigh his stock of parcels on the scales
Everywhere voices were calling weights there was the chink of metal the rapid snapping of string the hurrying to old Mr Melling for stamps
And at last the postman came with his sack laughing and jolly
Then everything slacked off and Paul took his dinnerbasket and ran to the station to catch the eighttwenty train
The day in the factory was just twelve hours long
His mother sat waiting for him rather anxiously
He had to walk from Keston so was not home until about twenty past nine
And he left the house before seven in the morning
Mrs Morel was rather anxious about his health
But she herself had had to put up with so much that she expected her children to take the same odds
They must go through with what came
And Paul stayed at Jordans although all the time he was there his health suffered from the darkness and lack of air and the long hours
He came in pale and tired
His mother looked at him
She saw he was rather pleased and her anxiety all went
Well and how was it
she asked
Ever so funny mother he replied
You dont have to work a bit hard and theyre nice with you
And did you get on all right
Yes they only say my writings bad
But Mr Pappleworth hes my mansaid to Mr Jordan I should be all right
Im Spiral mother you must come and see
Its ever so nice
Soon he liked Jordans
Mr Pappleworth who had a certain saloon bar flavour about him was always natural and treated him as if he had been a comrade
Sometimes the Spiral boss was irritable and chewed more lozenges than ever
Even then however he was not offensive but one of those people who hurt themselves by their own irritability more than they hurt other people
Havent you done that YET
he would cry
Go on be a month of Sundays
Again and Paul could understand him least then he was jocular and in high spirits
Im going to bring my little Yorkshire terrier bitch tomorrow he said jubilantly to Paul
Whats a Yorkshire terrier
DONT know what a Yorkshire terrier is
DONT KNOW A YORKSHIRE Mr Pappleworth was aghast
Is it a little silky onecolours of iron and rusty silver
THATS it my lad
Shes a gem
Shes had five pounds worth of pups already and shes worth over seven pounds herself and she doesnt weigh twenty ounces
The next day the bitch came
She was a shivering miserable morsel
Paul did not care for her she seemed so like a wet rag that would never dry
Then a man called for her and began to make coarse jokes
But Mr Pappleworth nodded his head in the direction of the boy and the talk went on sotto voce
Mr Jordan only made one more excursion to watch Paul and then the only fault he found was seeing the boy lay his pen on the counter
Put your pen in your ear if youre going to be a clerk
Pen in your ear
And one day he said to the lad Why dont you hold your shoulders straighter
Come down here when he took him into the glass office and fitted him with special braces for keeping the shoulders square
But Paul liked the girls best
The men seemed common and rather dull
He liked them all but they were uninteresting
Polly the little brisk overseer downstairs finding Paul eating in the cellar asked him if she could cook him anything on her little stove
Next day his mother gave him a dish that could be heated up
He took it into the pleasant clean room to Polly
And very soon it grew to be an established custom that he should have dinner with her
When he came in at eight in the morning he took his basket to her and when he came down at one oclock she had his dinner ready
He was not very tall and pale with thick chestnut hair irregular features and a wide full mouth
She was like a small bird
He often called her a robinet
Though naturally rather quiet he would sit and chatter with her for hours telling her about his home
The girls all liked to hear him talk
They often gathered in a little circle while he sat on a bench and held forth to them laughing
Some of them regarded him as a curious little creature so serious yet so bright and jolly and always so delicate in his way with them
They all liked him and he adored them
Polly he felt he belonged to
Then Connie with her mane of red hair her face of appleblossom her murmuring voice such a lady in her shabby black frock appealed to his romantic side
When you sit winding he said it looks as if you were spinning at a spinningwheelit looks ever so nice
You remind me of Elaine in the Idylls of the King
Id draw you if I could
And she glanced at him blushing shyly
And later on he had a sketch he prized very much Connie sitting on the stool before the wheel her flowing mane of red hair on her rusty black frock her red mouth shut and serious running the scarlet thread off the hank on to the reel
With Louie handsome and brazen who always seemed to thrust her hip at him he usually joked
Emma was rather plain rather old and condescending
But to condescend to him made her happy and he did not mind
How do you put needles in
he asked
Go away and dont bother
But I ought to know how to put needles in
She ground at her machine all the while steadily
There are many things you ought to know she replied
Tell me then how to stick needles in the machine
Oh the boy what a nuisance he is
Why THIS is how you do it
He watched her attentively
Suddenly a whistle piped
Then Polly appeared and said in a clear voice Mr Pappleworth wants to know how much longer youre going to be down here playing with the girls Paul
Paul flew upstairs calling Goodbye
and Emma drew herself up
It wasnt ME who wanted him to play with the machine she said
As a rule when all the girls came back at two oclock he ran upstairs to Fanny the hunchback in the finishingoff room
Mr Pappleworth did not appear till twenty to three and he often found his boy sitting beside Fanny talking or drawing or singing with the girls
Often after a minutes hesitation Fanny would begin to sing
She had a fine contralto voice
Everybody joined in the chorus and it went well
Paul was not at all embarrassed after a while sitting in the room with the half a dozen workgirls
At the end of the song Fanny would say I know youve been laughing at me
Dont be so soft Fanny
cried one of the girls
Once there was mention of Connies red hair
Fannys is better to my fancy said Emma
You neednt try to make a fool of me said Fanny flushing deeply
No but she has Paul shes got beautiful hair
Its a treat of a colour said he
That coldish colour like earth and yet shiny
Its like bogwater
Goodness me
exclaimed one girl laughing
How I do but get criticised said Fanny
But you should see it down Paul cried Emma earnestly
Its simply beautiful
Put it down for him Fanny if he wants something to paint
Fanny would not and yet she wanted to
Then Ill take it down myself said the lad
Well you can if you like said Fanny
And he carefully took the pins out of the knot and the rush of hair of uniform dark brown slid over the humped back
What a lovely lot
he exclaimed
The girls watched
There was silence
The youth shook the hair loose from the coil
Its splendid
he said smelling its perfume
Ill bet its worth pounds
Ill leave it you when I die Paul said Fanny half joking
You look just like anybody else sitting drying their hair said one of the girls to the longlegged hunchback
Poor Fanny was morbidly sensitive always imagining insults
Polly was curt and businesslike
The two departments were for ever at war and Paul was always finding Fanny in tears
Then he was made the recipient of all her woes and he had to plead her case with Polly
So the time went along happily enough
The factory had a homely feel
No one was rushed or driven
Paul always enjoyed it when the work got faster towards posttime and all the men united in labour
He liked to watch his fellowclerks at work
The man was the work and the work was the man one thing for the time being
It was different with the girls
The real woman never seemed to be there at the task but as if left out waiting
From the train going home at night he used to watch the lights of the town sprinkled thick on the hills fusing together in a blaze in the valleys
He felt rich in life and happy
Drawing farther off there was a patch of lights at Bulwell like myriad petals shaken to the ground from the shed stars and beyond was the red glare of the furnaces playing like hot breath on the clouds
He had to walk two and more miles from Keston home up two long hills down two short hills
He was often tired and he counted the lamps climbing the hill above him how many more to pass
And from the hilltop on pitchdark nights he looked round on the villages five or six miles away that shone like swarms of glittering living things almost a heaven against his feet
Marlpool and Heanor scattered the faroff darkness with brilliance
And occasionally the black valley space between was traced violated by a great train rushing south to London or north to Scotland
The trains roared by like projectiles level on the darkness fuming and burning making the valley clang with their passage
They were gone and the lights of the towns and villages glittered in silence
And then he came to the corner at home which faced the other side of the night
The ashtree seemed a friend now
His mother rose with gladness as he entered
He put his eight shillings proudly on the table
Itll help mother
he asked wistfully
Theres precious little left she answered after your ticket and dinners and such are taken off
Then he told her the budget of the day
His lifestory like an Arabian Nights was told night after night to his mother
It was almost as if it were her own life
CHAPTER VI DEATH IN THE FAMILY ARTHUR MOREL was growing up
He was a quick careless impulsive boy a good deal like his father
He hated study made a great moan if he had to work and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again
In appearance he remained the flower of the family being well made graceful and full of life
His dark brown hair and fresh colouring and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes together with his generous manner and fiery temper made him a favourite
But as he grew older his temper became uncertain
He flew into rages over nothing seemed unbearably raw and irritable
His mother whom he loved wearied of him sometimes
He thought only of himself
When he wanted amusement all that stood in his way he hated even if it were she
When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly
Goodness boy
she said when he groaned about a master who he said hated him if you dont like it alter it and if you cant alter it put up with it
And his father whom he had loved and who had worshipped him he came to detest
As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin
His body which had been beautiful in movement and in being shrank did not seem to ripen with the years but to get mean and rather despicable
There came over him a look of meanness and of paltriness
And when the meanlooking elderly man bullied or ordered the boy about Arthur was furious
Moreover Morels manners got worse and worse his habits somewhat disgusting
When the children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls
His manners in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit
Dirty nuisance
Arthur would cry jumping up and going straight out of the house when his father disgusted him
And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it
He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them and driving them nearly mad while they were so irritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen
So that Arthur who was growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly hated him worst of all
Then sometimes the father would seem to feel the contemptuous hatred of his children
Theres not a man tries harder for his family
he would shout
He does his best for them and then gets treated like a dog
But Im not going to stand it I tell you
But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as be imagined they would have felt sorry
As it was the battle now went on nearly all between father and children he persisting in his dirty and disgusting ways just to assert his independence
They loathed him
Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last that when he won a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham his mother decided to let him live in town with one of her sisters and only come home at weekends
Annie was still a junior teacher in the Boardschool earning about four shillings a week
But soon she would have fifteen shillings since she had passed her examination and there would be financial peace in the house
Mrs Morel clung now to Paul
He was quiet and not brilliant
But still he stuck to his painting and still he stuck to his mother
Everything he did was for her
She waited for his coming home in the evening and then she unburdened herself of all she had pondered or of all that had occurred to her during the day
He sat and listened with his earnestness
The two shared lives
William was engaged now to his brunette and had bought her an engagement ring that cost eight guineas
The children gasped at such a fabulous price
Eight guineas
said Morel
More fool him
If hed gen me some ont it ud ha looked better on im
Given YOU some of it
cried Mrs Morel
Why give YOU some of it
She remembered HE had bought no engagement ring at all and she preferred William who was not mean if he were foolish
But now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went with his betrothed and the different resplendent clothes she wore or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like great swells
He wanted to bring the girl home
Mrs Morel said she should come at the Christmas
This time William arrived with a lady but with no presents
Mrs Morel had prepared supper
Hearing footsteps she rose and went to the door
William entered
Hello mother
He kissed her hastily then stood aside to present a tall handsome girl who was wearing a costume of fine blackandwhite check and furs
Heres Gyp
Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small smile
Oh how do you do Mrs
Morel
she exclaimed
I am afraid you will be hungry said Mrs Morel
Oh no we had dinner in the train
Have you got my gloves Chubby
William Morel big and rawboned looked at her quickly
How should I
he said
Then Ive lost them
Dont be cross with me
A frown went over his face but he said nothing
She glanced round the kitchen
It was small and curious to her with its glittering kissingbunch its evergreens behind the pictures its wooden chairs and little deal table
At that moment Morel came in
Hello dad
Hello my son
Thas let on me
The two shook hands and William presented the lady
She gave the same smile that showed her teeth
How do you do Mr
Morel
Morel bowed obsequiously
Im very well and I hope so are you
You must make yourself very welcome
Oh thank you she replied rather amused
You will like to go upstairs said Mrs Morel
If you dont mind but not if it is any trouble to you
It is no trouble
Annie will take you
Walter carry up this box
And dont be an hour dressing yourself up said William to his betrothed
Annie took a brass candlestick and too shy almost to speak preceded the young lady to the front bedroom which Mr and Mrs Morel had vacated for her
It too was small and cold by candlelight
The colliers wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case of extreme illness
Shall I unstrap the box
asked Annie
Oh thank you very much
Annie played the part of maid then went downstairs for hot water
I think shes rather tired mother said William
Its a beastly journey and we had such a rush
Is there anything I can give her
asked Mrs Morel
Oh no shell be all right
But there was a chill in the atmosphere
After half an hour Miss Western came down having put on a purplishcoloured dress very fine for the colliers kitchen
I told you youd no need to change said William to her
Oh Chubby
Then she turned with that sweetish smile to Mrs Morel
Dont you think hes always grumbling Mrs
Morel
Is he
said Mrs Morel
Thats not very nice of him
It isnt really
You are cold said the mother
Wont you come near the fire
Morel jumped out of his armchair
Come and sit you here
he cried
Come and sit you here
No dad keep your own chair
Sit on the sofa Gyp said William
No no
cried Morel
This cheers warmest
Come and sit here Miss Wesson
Thank you so much said the girl seating herself in the colliers armchair the place of honour
She shivered feeling the warmth of the kitchen penetrate her
Fetch me a hanky Chubby dear
she said putting up her mouth to him and using the same intimate tone as if they were alone which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not to be present
The young lady evidently did not realise them as people they were creatures to her for the present
William winced
In such a household in Streatham Miss Western would have been a lady condescending to her inferiors
These people were to her certainly clownishin short the working classes
How was she to adjust herself
Ill go said Annie
Miss Western took no notice as if a servant had spoken
But when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief she said Oh thank you
in a gracious way
She sat and talked about the dinner on the train which had been so poor about London about dances
She was really very nervous and chattered from fear
Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco watching her and listening to her glib London speech as he puffed
Mrs Morel dressed up in her best black silk blouse answered quietly and rather briefly
The three children sat round in silence and admiration
Miss Western was the princess
Everything of the best was got out for her the best cups the best spoons the best table cloth the best coffeejug
The children thought she must find it quite grand
She felt strange not able to realise the people not knowing how to treat them
William joked and was slightly uncomfortable
At about ten oclock he said to her Arent you tired Gyp
Rather Chubby she answered at once in the intimate tones and putting her head slightly on one side
Ill light her the candle mother he said
Very well replied the mother
Miss Western stood up held out her hand to Mrs Morel
Goodnight Mrs Morel she said
Paul sat at the boiler letting the water run from the tap into a stone beerbottle
Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel pitsinglet and kissed her mother goodnight
She was to share the room with the lady because the house was full
You wait a minute said Mrs Morel to Annie
And Annie sat nursing the hotwater bottle
Miss Western shook hands all round to everybodys discomfort and took her departure preceded by William
In five minutes he was downstairs again
His heart was rather sore he did not know why
He talked very little till everybody had gone to bed but himself and his mother
Then he stood with his legs apart in his old attitude on the hearthrug and said hesitatingly Well mother
Well my son
She sat in the rockingchair feeling somehow hurt and humiliated for his sake
Do you like her
Yes came the slow answer
Shes shy yet mother
Shes not used to it
Its different from her aunts house you know
Of course it is my boy and she must find it difficult
She does
Then he frowned swiftly
If only she wouldnt put on her BLESSED airs
Its only her first awkwardness my boy
Shell be all right
Thats it mother he replied gratefully
But his brow was gloomy
You know shes not like you mother
Shes not serious and she cant think
Shes young my boy
Yes and shes had no sort of show
Her mother died when she was a child
Since then shes lived with her aunt whom she cant bear
And her father was a rake
Shes had no love
No
Well you must make up to her
And soyou have to forgive her a lot of things
WHAT do you have to forgive her my boy
I dunno
When she seems shallow you have to remember shes never had anybody to bring her deeper side out
And shes FEARFULLY fond of me
Anybody can see that
But you know mothershesshes different from us
Those sort of people like those she lives amongst they dont seem to have the same principles
You mustnt judge too hastily said Mrs Morel
But he seemed uneasy within himself
In the morning however he was up singing and larking round the house
Hello
he called sitting on the stairs
Are you getting up
Yes her voice called faintly
Merry Christmas
he shouted to her
Her laugh pretty and tinkling was heard in the bedroom
She did not come down in half an hour
Was she REALLY getting up when she said she was
he asked of Annie
Yes she was replied Annie
He waited a while then went to the stairs again
Happy New Year he called
Thank you Chubby dear
came the laughing voice far away
Buck up
he implored
It was nearly an hour and still he was waiting for her
Morel who always rose before six looked at the clock
Well its a winder
he exclaimed
The family had breakfasted all but William
He went to the foot of the stairs
Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there
he called rather crossly
She only laughed
The family expected after that time of preparation something like magic
At last she came looking very nice in a blouse and skirt
Have you REALLY been all this time getting ready
he asked
Chubby dear
That question is not permitted is it Mrs
Morel
She played the grand lady at first
When she went with William to chapel he in his frockcoat and silk hat she in her furs and Londonmade costume Paul and Arthur and Annie expected everybody to bow to the ground in admiration
And Morel standing in his Sunday suit at the end of the road watching the gallant pair go felt he was the father of princes and princesses
And yet she was not so grand
For a year now she had been a sort of secretary or clerk in a London office
But while she was with the Morels she queened it
She sat and let Annie or Paul wait on her as if they were her servants
She treated Mrs Morel with a certain glibness and Morel with patronage
But after a day or so she began to change her tune
William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them on their walks
It was so much more interesting
And Paul really DID admire Gipsy wholeheartedly in fact his mother scarcely forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl
On the second day when Lily said Oh Annie do you know where I left my muff
William replied You know it is in your bedroom
Why do you ask Annie
And Lily went upstairs with a cross shut mouth
But it angered the young man that she made a servant of his sister
On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together in the parlour by the fire in the dark
At a quarter to eleven Mrs Morel was heard raking the fire
William came out to the kitchen followed by his beloved
Is it as late as that mother
he said
She had been sitting alone
It is not LATE my boy but it is as late as I usually sit up
Wont you go to bed then
he asked
And leave you two
No my boy I dont believe in it
Cant you trust us mother
Whether I can or not I wont do it
You can stay till eleven if you like and I can read
Go to bed Gyp he said to his girl
We wont keep mater waiting
Annie has left the candle burning Lily said Mrs Morel I think you will see
Yes thank you
Goodnight Mrs
Morel
William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs and she went
He returned to the kitchen
Cant you trust us mother
he repeated rather offended
My boy I tell you I dont BELIEVE in leaving two young things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed
And he was forced to take this answer
He kissed his mother goodnight
At Easter he came over alone
And then he discussed his sweetheart endlessly with his mother
You know mother when Im away from her I dont care for her a bit
I shouldnt care if I never saw her again
But then when Im with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her
Its a queer sort of love to marry on said Mrs Morel if she holds you no more than that
It IS funny
he exclaimed
It worried and perplexed him
But yettheres so much between us now I couldnt give her up
You know best said Mrs Morel
But if it is as you say I wouldnt call it LOVEat any rate it doesnt look much like it
Oh I dont know mother
Shes an orphan and They never came to any sort of conclusion
He seemed puzzled and rather fretted
She was rather reserved
All his strength and money went in keeping this girl
He could scarcely afford to take his mother to Nottingham when he came over
Pauls wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings to his great joy
He was quite happy at Jordans but his health suffered from the long hours and the confinement
His mother to whom he became more and more significant thought how to help
His halfday holiday was on Monday afternoon
On a Monday morning in May as the two sat alone at breakfast she said I think it will be a fine day
He looked up in surprise
This meant something
You know Mr Leivers has gone to live on a new farm
Well he asked me last week if I wouldnt go and see Mrs Leivers and I promised to bring you on Monday if its fine
Shall we go
I say little woman how lovely
he cried
And well go this afternoon
Paul hurried off to the station jubilant
Down Derby Road was a cherrytree that glistened
The old brick wall by the Statutes ground burned scarlet spring was a very flame of green
And the steep swoop of highroad lay in its cool morning dust splendid with patterns of sunshine and shadow perfectly still
The trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly and inside the warehouse all the morning the boy had a vision of spring outside
When he came home at dinnertime his mother was rather excited
Are we going
he asked
When Im ready she replied
Presently he got up
Go and get dressed while I wash up he said
She did so
He washed the pots straightened and then took her boots
They were quite clean
Mrs Morel was one of those naturally exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying their shoes
But Paul had to clean them for her
They were kid boots at eight shillings a pair
He however thought them the most dainty boots in the world and he cleaned them with as much reverence as if they had been flowers
Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly
She had got a new cotton blouse on
Paul jumped up and went forward
Oh my stars
he exclaimed
What a bobbydazzler
She sniffed in a little haughty way and put her head up
Its not a bobbydazzler at all
she replied
Its very quiet
She walked forward whilst he hovered round her
Well she asked quite shy but pretending to be high and mighty do you like it
Awfully
You ARE a fine little woman to go jaunting out with
He went and surveyed her from the back
Well he said if I was walking down the street behind you I should say Doesnt THAT little person fancy herself
Well she doesnt replied Mrs Morel
Shes not sure it suits her
Oh no
she wants to be in dirty black looking as if she was wrapped in burnt paper
It DOES suit you and I say you look nice
She sniffed in her little way pleased but pretending to know better
Well she said its cost me just three shillings
You couldnt have got it readymade for that price could you
I should think you couldnt he replied
And you know its good stuff
Awfully pretty he said
The blouse was white with a little sprig of heliotrope and black
Too young for me though Im afraid she said
Too young for you
he exclaimed in disgust
Why dont you buy some false white hair and stick it on your head
I sll soon have no need she replied
Im going white fast enough
Well youve no business to he said
What do I want with a whitehaired mother
Im afraid youll have to put up with one my lad she said rather strangely
They set off in great style she carrying the umbrella William had given her because of the sun
Paul was considerably taller than she though he was not big
He fancied himself
On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily
Minton pit waved its plumes of white steam coughed and rattled hoarsely
Now look at that
said Mrs Morel
Mother and son stood on the road to watch
Along the ridge of the great pithill crawled a little group in silhouette against the sky a horse a small truck and a man
They climbed the incline against the heavens
At the end the man tipped the wagon
There was an undue rattle as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank
You sit a minute mother he said and she took a seat on a bank whilst he sketched rapidly
She was silent whilst he worked looking round at the afternoon the red cottages shining among their greenness
The world is a wonderful place she said and wonderfully beautiful
And sos the pit he said
Look how it heaps together like something alive almosta big creature that you dont know
Yes she said
Perhaps
And all the trucks standing waiting like a string of beasts to be fed he said
And very thankful I am they ARE standing she said for that means theyll turn middling time this week
But I like the feel of MEN on things while theyre alive
Theres a feel of men about trucks because theyve been handled with mens hands all of them
Yes said Mrs Morel
They went along under the trees of the highroad
He was constantly informing her but she was interested
They passed the end of Nethermere that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly in its lap
Then they turned on a private road and in some trepidation approached a big farm
A dog barked furiously
A woman came out to see
Is this the way to Willey Farm
Mrs Morel asked
Paul hung behind in terror of being sent back
But the woman was amiable and directed them
The mother and son went through the wheat and oats over a little bridge into a wild meadow
Peewits with their white breasts glistening wheeled and screamed about them
The lake was still and blue
High overhead a heron floated
Opposite the wood heaped on the hill green and still
Its a wild road mother said Paul
Just like Canada
Isnt it beautiful
said Mrs Morel looking round
See that heronseesee her legs
He directed his mother what she must see and what not
And she was quite content
But now she said which way
He told me through the wood
The wood fenced and dark lay on their left
I can feel a bit of a path this road said Paul
Youve got town feet somehow or other you have
They found a little gate and soon were in a broad green alley of the wood with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand an old oak glade dipping down on the other
And among the oaks the bluebells stood in pools of azure under the new green hazels upon a pale fawn floor of oakleaves
He found flowers for her
Heres a bit of newmown hay he said then again he brought her forgetmenots
And again his heart hurt with love seeing her hand used with work holding the little bunch of flowers he gave her
She was perfectly happy
But at the end of the riding was a fence to climb
Paul was over in a second
Come he said let me help you
No go away
I will do it in my own way
He stood below with his hands up ready to help her
She climbed cautiously
What a way to climb
he exclaimed scornfully when she was safely to earth again
Hateful stiles
she cried
Duffer of a little woman he replied who cant get over em
In front along the edge of the wood was a cluster of low red farm buildings
The two hastened forward
Flush with the wood was the apple orchard where blossom was falling on the grindstone
The pond was deep under a hedge and overhanging oak trees
Some cows stood in the shade
The farm and buildings three sides of a quadrangle embraced the sunshine towards the wood
It was very still
Mother and son went into the small railed garden where was a scent of red gillivers
By the open door were some floury loaves put out to cool
A hen was just coming to peck them
Then in the doorway suddenly appeared a girl in a dirty apron
She was about fourteen years old had a rosy dark face a bunch of short black curls very fine and free and dark eyes shy questioning a little resentful of the strangers she disappeared
In a minute another figure appeared a small frail woman rosy with great dark brown eyes
Oh
she exclaimed smiling with a little glow youve come then
I AM glad to see you
Her voice was intimate and rather sad
The two women shook hands
Now are you sure were not a bother to you
said Mrs Morel
I know what a farming life is
Oh no
Were only too thankful to see a new face its so lost up here
I suppose so said Mrs Morel
They were taken through into the parloura long low room with a great bunch of guelderroses in the fireplace
There the women talked whilst Paul went out to survey the land
He was in the garden smelling the gillivers and looking at the plants when the girl came out quickly to the heap of coal which stood by the fence
I suppose these are cabbageroses
he said to her pointing to the bushes along the fence
She looked at him with startled big brown eyes
I suppose they are cabbageroses when they come out
he said
I dont know she faltered
Theyre white with pink middles
Then theyre maidenblush
Miriam flushed
She had a beautiful warm colouring
I dont know she said
You dont have MUCH in your garden he said
This is our first year here she answered in a distant rather superior way drawing back and going indoors
He did not notice but went his round of exploration
Presently his mother came out and they went through the buildings
Paul was hugely delighted
And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look after
said Mrs Morel to Mrs Leivers
No replied the little woman
I cant find time to look after cattle and Im not used to it
Its as much as I can do to keep going in the house
Well I suppose it is said Mrs Morel
Presently the girl came out
Tea is ready mother she said in a musical quiet voice
Oh thank you Miriam then well come replied her mother almost ingratiatingly
Would you CARE to have tea now Mrs
Morel
Of course said Mrs Morel
Whenever its ready
Paul and his mother and Mrs Leivers had tea together
Then they went out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells while fumy forgetmenots were in the paths
The mother and son were in ecstasy together
When they got back to the house Mr Leivers and Edgar the eldest son were in the kitchen
Edgar was about eighteen
Then Geoffrey and Maurice big lads of twelve and thirteen were in from school
Mr Leivers was a goodlooking man in the prime of life with a goldenbrown moustache and blue eyes screwed up against the weather
The boys were condescending but Paul scarcely observed it
They went round for eggs scrambling into all sorts of places
As they were feeding the fowls Miriam came out
The boys took no notice of her
One hen with her yellow chickens was in a coop
Maurice took his hand full of corn and let the hen peck from it
Durst you do it
he asked of Paul
Lets see said Paul
He had a small hand warm and rather capablelooking
Miriam watched
He held the corn to the hen
The bird eyed it with her hard bright eye and suddenly made a peck into his hand
He started and laughed
Rap rap rap
went the birds beak in his palm
He laughed again and the other boys joined
She knocks you and nips you but she never hurts said Paul when the last corn had gone 
Now Miriam said Maurice you come an ave a go
No she cried shrinking back
Ha
baby
The mardykid
said her brothers
It doesnt hurt a bit said Paul
It only just nips rather nicely
No she still cried shaking her black curls and shrinking
She dursnt said Geoffrey
She niver durst do anything except recite poitry
Dursnt jump off a gate dursnt tweedle dursnt go on a slide dursnt stop a girl hittin her
She can do nowt but go about thinkin herself somebody
The Lady of the Lake
Yah
cried Maurice
Miriam was crimson with shame and misery
I dare do more than you she cried
Youre never anything but cowards and bullies
Oh cowards and bullies
they repeated mincingly mocking her speech
Not such a clown shall anger me A boor is answered silently he quoted against her shouting with laughter
She went indoors
Paul went with the boys into the orchard where they had rigged up a parallel bar
They did feats of strength
He was more agile than strong but it served
He fingered a piece of appleblossom that hung low on a swinging bough
I wouldnt get the appleblossom said Edgar the eldest brother
Therell be no apples next year
I wasnt going to get it replied Paul going away
The boys felt hostile to him they were more interested in their own pursuits
He wandered back to the house to look for his mother
As he went round the back he saw Miriam kneeling in front of the hencoop some maize in her hand biting her lip and crouching in an intense attitude
The hen was eyeing her wickedly
Very gingerly she put forward her hand
The hen bobbed for her
She drew back quickly with a cry half of fear half of chagrin
It wont hurt you said Paul
She flushed crimson and started up
I only wanted to try she said in a low voice
See it doesnt hurt he said and putting only two corns in his palm he let the hen peck peck peck at his bare hand
It only makes you laugh he said
She put her hand forward and dragged it away tried again and started back with a cry
He frowned
Why Id let her take corn from my face said Paul only she bumps a bit
Shes ever so neat
If she wasnt look how much ground shed peck up every day
He waited grimly and watched
At last Miriam let the bird peck from her hand
She gave a little cryfear and pain because of fearrather pathetic
But she had done it and she did it again
There you see said the boy
It doesnt hurt does it
She looked at him with dilated dark eyes
No she laughed trembling
Then she rose and went indoors
She seemed to be in some way resentful of the boy
He thinks Im only a common girl she thought and she wanted to prove she was a grand person like the Lady of the Lake
Paul found his mother ready to go home
She smiled on her son
He took the great bunch of flowers
Mr and Mrs Leivers walked down the fields with them
The hills were golden with evening deep in the woods showed the darkening purple of bluebells
It was everywhere perfectly stiff save for the rustling of leaves and birds
But it is a beautiful place said Mrs Morel
Yes answered Mr Leivers its a nice little place if only it werent for the rabbits
The pastures bitten down to nothing
I dunno if ever I sll get the rent off it
He clapped his hands and the field broke into motion near the woods brown rabbits hopping everywhere
Would you believe it
exclaimed Mrs Morel
She and Paul went on alone together
Wasnt it lovely mother
he said quietly
A thin moon was coming out
His heart was full of happiness till it hurt
His mother had to chatter because she too wanted to cry with happiness
Now WOULDNT I help that man
she said
WOULDNT I see to the fowls and the young stock
And ID learn to milk and ID talk with him and ID plan with him
My word if I were his wife the farm would be run I know
But there she hasnt the strengthshe simply hasnt the strength
She ought never to have been burdened like it you know
Im sorry for her and Im sorry for him too
My word if ID had him I shouldnt have thought him a bad husband
Not that she does either and shes very lovable
William came home again with his sweetheart at the Whitsuntide
He had one week of his holidays then
It was beautiful weather
As a rule William and Lily and Paul went out in the morning together for a walk
William did not talk to his beloved much except to tell her things from his boyhood
Paul talked endlessly to both of them
They lay down all three in a meadow by Minton Church
On one side by the Castle Farm was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars
Hawthorn was dropping from the hedges penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field like laughter
William a big fellow of twentythree thinner now and even a bit gaunt lay back in the sunshine and dreamed while she fingered with his hair
Paul went gathering the big daisies
She had taken off her hat her hair was black as a horses mane
Paul came back and threaded daisies in her jetblack hairbig spangles of white and yellow and just a pink touch of ragged robin
Now you look like a young witchwoman the boy said to her
Doesnt she William
Lily laughed
William opened his eyes and looked at her
In his gaze was a certain baffled look of misery and fierce appreciation
Has he made a sight of me
she asked laughing down on her lover
That he has
said William smiling
He looked at her
Her beauty seemed to hurt him
He glanced at her flowerdecked head and frowned
You look nice enough if thats what you want to know he said
And she walked without her hat
In a little while William recovered and was rather tender to her
Coming to a bridge he carved her initials and his in a heart
L L W W M She watched his strong nervous hand with its glistening hairs and freckles as he carved and she seemed fascinated by it
All the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth and a certain tenderness in the house whilst William and Lily were at home
But often he got irritable
She had brought for an eightdays stay five dresses and six blouses
Oh would you mind she said to Annie washing me these two blouses and these things
And Annie stood washing when William and Lily went out the next morning
Mrs Morel was furious
And sometimes the young man catching a glimpse of his sweethearts attitude towards his sister hated her
On Sunday morning she looked very beautiful in a dress of foulard silky and sweeping and blue as a jaybirds feather and in a large cream hat covered with many roses mostly crimson
Nobody could admire her enough
But in the evening when she was going out she asked again Chubby have you got my gloves
Which
asked William
My new black SUEDE
No
There was a hunt
She had lost them
Look here mother said William thats the fourth pair shes lost since Christmasat five shillings a pair
You only gave me TWO of them she remonstrated
And in the evening after supper he stood on the hearthrug whilst she sat on the sofa and he seemed to hate her
In the afternoon he had left her whilst he went to see some old friend
She had sat looking at a book
After supper William wanted to write a letter
Here is your book Lily said Mrs Morel
Would you care to go on with it for a few minutes
No thank you said the girl
I will sit still
But it is so dull
William scribbled irritably at a great rate
As he sealed the envelope he said Read a book
Why shes never read a book in her life
Oh go along
said Mrs Morel cross with the exaggeration Its true mothershe hasnt he cried jumping up and taking his old position on the hearthrug
Shes never read a book in her life
Ers like me chimed in Morel
Er canna see what there is i books ter sit borin your nose in em for nor more can I
But you shouldnt say these things said Mrs Morel to her son
But its true mothershe CANT read
What did you give her
Well I gave her a little thing of Annie Swans
Nobody wants to read dry stuff on Sunday afternoon
Well Ill bet she didnt read ten lines of it
You are mistaken said his mother
All the time Lily sat miserably on the sofa
He turned to her swiftly
DID you ready any
he asked
Yes I did she replied
How much
l dont know how many pages
Tell me ONE THING you read
She could not
She never got beyond the second page
He read a great deal and had a quick active intelligence
She could understand nothing but lovemaking and chatter
He was accustomed to having all his thoughts sifted through his mothers mind so when he wanted companionship and was asked in reply to be the billing and twittering lover he hated his betrothed
You know mother he said when he was alone with her at night shes no idea of money shes so wesselbrained
When shes paid shell suddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces and then I have to buy her season ticket and her extras even her underclothing
And she wants to get married and I think myself we might as well get married next year
But at this rate A fine mess of a marriage it would be replied his mother
I should consider it again my boy
Oh well Ive gone too far to break off now he said and so I shall get married as soon as I can
Very well my boy
If you will you will and theres no stopping you but I tell you I cant sleep when I think about it
Oh shell be all right mother
We shall manage
And she lets you buy her underclothing
asked the mother
Well he began apologetically she didnt ask me but one morningand it WAS coldI found her on the station shivering not able to keep still so I asked her if she was well wrapped up
She said I think so
So I said Have you got warm underthings on
And she said No they were cotton
I asked her why on earth she hadnt got something thicker on in weather like that and she said because she HAD nothing
And there she isa bronchial subject
I HAD to take her and get some warm things
Well mother I shouldnt mind the money if we had any
And you know she OUGHT to keep enough to pay for her seasonticket but no she comes to me about that and I have to find the money
Its a poor lookout said Mrs Morel bitterly
He was pale and his rugged face that used to be so perfectly careless and laughing was stamped with conflict and despair
But I cant give her up now its gone too far he said
And besides for SOME things I couldnt do without her
My boy remember youre taking your life in your hands said Mrs Morel
NOTHING is as bad as a marriage thats a hopeless failure
Mine was bad enough God knows and ought to teach you something but it might have been worse by a long chalk
He leaned with his back against the side of the chimneypiece his hands in his pockets
He was a big rawboned man who looked as if he would go to the worlds end if he wanted to
But she saw the despair on his face
I couldnt give her up now he said
Well she said remember there are worse wrongs than breaking off an engagement
I cant give her up NOW he said
The clock ticked on mother and son remained in silence a conflict between them but he would say no more
At last she said Well go to bed my son
Youll feel better in the morning and perhaps youll know better
He kissed her and went
She raked the fire
Her heart was heavy now as it had never been
Before with her husband things had seemed to be breaking down in her but they did not destroy her power to live
Now her soul felt lamed in itself
It was her hope that was struck
And so often William manifested the same hatred towards his betrothed
On the last evening at home he was railing against her
Well he said if you dont believe me what shes like would you believe she has been confirmed three times
Nonsense
laughed Mrs Morel
Nonsense or not she HAS
Thats what confirmation means for hera bit of a theatrical show where she can cut a figure
I havent Mrs
Morel
cried the girlI havent
it is not true
What
he cried flashing round on her
Once in Bromley once in Beckenham and once somewhere else
Nowhere else
she said in tearsnowhere else
It WAS
And if it wasnt why were you confirmed TWICE
Once I was only fourteen Mrs Morel she pleaded tears in her eyes
Yes said Mrs Morel I can quite understand it child
Take no notice of him
You ought to be ashamed William saying such things
But its true
Shes religiousshe had blue velvet PrayerBooksand shes not as much religion or anything else in her than that tableleg
Gets confirmed three times for show to show herself off and thats how she is in EVERYTHING EVERYTHING
The girl sat on the sofa crying
She was not strong
As for LOVE
he cried you might as well ask a fly to love you
Itll love settling on you Now say no more commanded Mrs Morel
If you want to say these things you must find another place than this
I am ashamed of you William
Why dont you be more manly
To do nothing but find fault with a girl and then pretend youre engaged to her 
Mrs Morel subsided in wrath and indignation
William was silent and later he repented kissed and comforted the girl
Yet it was true what he had said
He hated her
When they were going away Mrs Morel accompanied them as far as Nottingham
It was a long way to Keston station
You know mother he said to her Gyps shallow
Nothing goes deep with her
William I WISH you wouldnt say these things said Mrs Morel very uncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her
But it doesnt mother
Shes very much in love with me now but if I died shed have forgotten me in three months
Mrs Morel was afraid
Her heart beat furiously hearing the quiet bitterness of her sons last speech
How do you know
she replied
You DONT know and therefore youve no right to say such a thing
Hes always saying these things
cried the girl
In three months after I was buried youd have somebody else and I should be forgotten he said
And thats your love
Mrs Morel saw them into the train in Nottingham then she returned home
Theres one comfort she said to Paulhell never have any money to marry on that I AM sure of
And so shell save him that way
So she took cheer
Matters were not yet very desperate
She firmly believed William would never marry his Gipsy
She waited and she kept Paul near to her
All summer long Williams letters had a feverish tone he seemed unnatural and intense
Sometimes he was exaggeratedly jolly usually he was flat and bitter in his letter
Ah his mother said Im afraid hes ruining himself against that creature who isnt worthy of his loveno no more than a rag doll
He wanted to come home
The midsummer holiday was gone it was a long while to Christmas
He wrote in wild excitement saying he could come for Saturday and Sunday at Goose Fair the first week in October
You are not well my boy said his mother when she saw him
She was almost in tears at having him to herself again
No Ive not been well he said
Ive seemed to have a dragging cold all the last month but its going I think
It was sunny October weather
He seemed wild with joy like a schoolboy escaped then again he was silent and reserved
He was more gaunt than ever and there was a haggard look in his eyes
You are doing too much said his mother to him
He was doing extra work trying to make some money to marry on he said
He only talked to his mother once on the Saturday night then he was sad and tender about his beloved
And yet you know mother for all that if I died shed be brokenhearted for two months and then shed start to forget me
Youd see shed never come home here to look at my grave not even once
Why William said his mother youre not going to die so why talk about it
But whether or not he replied
And she cant help it
She is like that and if you choose herwell you cant grumble said his mother
On the Sunday morning as he was putting his collar on Look he said to his mother holding up his chin what a rash my collars made under my chin
Just at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation
It ought not to do that said his mother
Here put a bit of this soothing ointment on
You should wear different collars
He went away on Sunday midnight seeming better and more solid for his two days at home
On Tuesday morning came a telegram from London that he was ill Mrs Morel got off her knees from washing the floor read the telegram called a neighbour went to her landlady and borrowed a sovereign put on her things and set off
She hurried to Keston caught an express for London in Nottingham
She had to wait in Nottingham nearly an hour
A small figure in her black bonnet she was anxiously asking the porters if they knew how to get to Elmers End
The journey was three hours
She sat in her corner in a kind of stupor never moving
At Kings Cross still no one could tell her how to get to Elmers End
Carrying her string bag that contained her nightdress a comb and brush she went from person to person
At last they sent her underground to Cannon Street
It was six oclock when she arrived at Williams lodging
The blinds were not down
How is he
she asked
No better said the landlady
She followed the woman upstairs
William lay on the bed with bloodshot eyes his face rather discoloured
The clothes were tossed about there was no fire in the room a glass of milk stood on the stand at his bedside
No one had been with him
Why my son
said the mother bravely
He did not answer
He looked at her but did not see her
Then he began to say in a dull voice as if repeating a letter from dictation Owing to a leakage in the hold of this vessel the sugar had set and become converted into rock
It needed hacking He was quite unconscious
It had been his business to examine some such cargo of sugar in the Port of London
How long has he been like this
the mother asked the landlady
He got home at six oclock on Monday morning and he seemed to sleep all day then in the night we heard him talking and this morning he asked for you
So I wired and we fetched the doctor
Will you have a fire made
Mrs Morel tried to soothe her son to keep him still
The doctor came
It was pneumonia and he said a peculiar erysipelas which had started under the chin where the collar chafed and was spreading over the face
He hoped it would not get to the brain
Mrs Morel settled down to nurse
She prayed for William prayed that he would recognise her
But the young mans face grew more discoloured
In the night she struggled with him
He raved and raved and would not come to consciousness
At two oclock in a dreadful paroxysm he died
Mrs Morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging bedroom then she roused the household
At six oclock with the aid of the charwoman she laid him out then she went round the dreary London village to the registrar and the doctor
At nine oclock to the cottage on Scargill Street came another wire William died last night
Let father come bring money
Annie Paul and Arthur were at home Mr Morel was gone to work
The three children said not a word
Annie began to whimper with fear Paul set off for his father
It was a beautiful day
At Brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in the sunshine of a soft blue sky the wheels of the headstocks twinkled high up the screen shuffling its coal into the trucks made a busy noise
I want my father hes got to go to London said the boy to the first man he met on the bank
Tha wants Walter Morel
Go in theer an tell Joe Ward
Paul went into the little top office
I want my father hes got to go to London
Thy feyther
Is he down
Whats his name
Mr
Morel
What Walter
Is owt amiss
Hes got to go to London
The man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office
Walter Morels wanted number 42 Hard
Summats amiss theres his lad here
Then he turned round to Paul
Hell be up in a few minutes he said
Paul wandered out to the pittop
He watched the chair come up with its wagon of coal
The great iron cage sank back on its rest a full carfle was hauled off an empty tram run on to the chair a bell tinged somewhere the chair heaved then dropped like a stone
Paul did not realise William was dead it was impossible with such a bustle going on
The pulleroff swung the small truck on to the turntable another man ran with it along the bank down the curving lines
And William is dead and my mothers in London and what will she be doing
the boy asked himself as if it were a conundrum
He watched chair after chair come up and still no father
At last standing beside a wagon a mans form
the chair sank on its rests Morel stepped off
He was slightly lame from an accident
Is it thee Paul
Is e worse
Youve got to go to London
The two walked off the pitbank where men were watching curiously
As they came out and went along the railway with the sunny autumn field on one side and a wall of trucks on the other Morel said in a frightened voice Es niver gone child
Yes
When wort
Last night
We had a telegram from my mother
Morel walked on a few strides then leaned up against a truckside his hand over his eyes
He was not crying
Paul stood looking round waiting
On the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly
Paul saw everything except his father leaning against the truck as if he were tired
Morel had only once before been to London
He set off scared and peaked to help his wife
That was on Tuesday
The children were left alone in the house
Paul went to work Arthur went to school and Annie had in a friend to be with her
On Saturday night as Paul was turning the corner coming home from Keston he saw his mother and father who had come to Sethley Bridge Station
They were walking in silence in the dark tired straggling apart
The boy waited
Mother
he said in the darkness
Mrs Morels small figure seemed not to observe
He spoke again
Paul
she said uninterestedly
She let him kiss her but she seemed unaware of him
In the house she was the samesmall white and mute
She noticed nothing she said nothing only The coffin will be here tonight Walter
Youd better see about some help
Then turning to the children Were bringing him home
Then she relapsed into the same mute looking into space her hands folded on her lap
Paul looking at her felt he could not breathe
The house was dead silent
I went to work mother he said plaintively
Did you
she answered dully
After half an hour Morel troubled and bewildered came in again
Wheer sll we hae him when he DOEScome
he asked his wife
In the frontroom
Then Id better shift th table
Yes
An hae him across th chairs
You know thereYes I suppose so
Morel and Paul went with a candle into the parlour
There was no gas there
The father unscrewed the top of the big mahogany oval table and cleared the middle of the room then he arranged six chairs opposite each other so that the coffin could stand on their beds
You niver seed such a length as he is
said the miner and watching anxiously as he worked
Paul went to the bay window and looked out
The ashtree stood monstrous and black in front of the wide darkness
It was a faintly luminous night
Paul went back to his mother
At ten oclock Morel called Hes here
Everyone started
There was a noise of unbarring and unlocking the front door which opened straight from the night into the room
Bring another candle called Morel
Annie and Arthur went
Paul followed with his mother
He stood with his arm round her waist in the inner doorway
Down the middle of the cleared room waited six chairs face to face
In the window against the lace curtains Arthur held up one candle and by the open door against the night Annie stood leaning forward her brass candlestick glittering
There was the noise of wheels
Outside in the darkness of the street below Paul could see horses and a black vehicle one lamp and a few pale faces then some men miners all in their shirtsleeves seemed to struggle in the obscurity
Presently two men appeared bowed beneath a great weight
It was Morel and his neighbour
Steady
called Morel out of breath
He and his fellow mounted the steep garden step heaved into the candlelight with their gleaming coffinend
Limbs of other men were seen struggling behind
Morel and Burns in front staggered the great dark weight swayed
Steady steady
cried Morel as if in pain
All the six bearers were up in the small garden holding the great coffin aloft
There were three more steps to the door
The yellow lamp of the carriage shone alone down the black road
Now then
said Morel
The coffin swayed the men began to mount the three steps with their load
Annies candle flickered and she whimpered as the first men appeared and the limbs and bowed heads of six men struggled to climb into the room bearing the coffin that rode like sorrow on their living flesh
Oh my sonmy son
Mrs Morel sang softly and each time the coffin swung to the unequal climbing of the men Oh my sonmy sonmy son
Mother
Paul whimpered his hand round her waist
She did not hear
Oh my sonmy son
she repeated
Paul saw drops of sweat fall from his fathers brow
Six men were in the roomsix coatless men with yielding struggling limbs filling the room and knocking against the furniture
The coffin veered and was gently lowered on to the chairs
The sweat fell from Morels face on its boards
My word hes a weight
said a man and the five miners sighed bowed and trembling with the struggle descended the steps again closing the door behind them
The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished box
William when laid out was six feet four inches long
Like a monument lay the bright brown ponderous coffin
Paul thought it would never be got out of the room again
His mother was stroking the polished wood
They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses
It was sunny and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves in the warmth
Mrs Morel could not be persuaded after this to talk and take her old bright interest in life
She remained shut off
All the way home in the train she had said to herself  If only it could have been me 
When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting her days work done with hands folded in her lap upon her coarse apron
She always used to have changed her dress and put on a black apron before
Now Annie set his supper and his mother sat looking blankly in front of her her mouth shut tight
Then he beat his brains for news to tell her
Mother Miss Jordan was down today and she said my sketch of a colliery at work was beautiful
But Mrs Morel took no notice
Night after night he forced himself to tell her things although she did not listen
It drove him almost insane to have her thus
At last Whats amatter mother
he asked
She did not hear
Whats amatter
he persisted
Mother whats amatter
You know whats the matter she said irritably turning away
The ladhe was sixteen years oldwent to bed drearily
He was cut off and wretched through October November and December
His mother tried but she could not rouse herself
She could only brood on her dead son he had been let to die so cruelly
At last on December 23 with his five shillings Christmasbox in his pocket Paul wandered blindly home
His mother looked at him and her heart stood still
Whats the matter
she asked
Im badly mother
he replied
Mr Jordan gave me five shillings for a Christmasbox
He handed it to her with trembling hands
She put it on the table
You arent glad
he reproached her but he trembled violently
Where hurts you
she said unbuttoning his overcoat
It was the old question
I feel badly mother
She undressed him and put him to bed
He had pneumonia dangerously the doctor said
Might he never have had it if Id kept him at home not let him go to Nottingham
was one of the first things she asked
He might not have been so bad said the doctor
Mrs Morel stood condemned on her own ground
I should have watched the living not the dead she told herself
Paul was very ill His mother lay in bed at nights with him they could not afford a nurse
He grew worse and the crisis approached
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly sickly feeling of dissolution when all the cells in the body seem in intense irritability to be breaking down and consciousness makes a last flare of struggle like madness
I sll die mother
be cried heaving for breath on the pillow
She lifted him up crying in a small voice Oh my sonmy son
That brought him to
He realised her
His whole will rose up and arrested him
He put his head on her breast and took ease of her for love
For some things said his aunt it was a good thing Paul was ill that Christmas
I believe it saved his mother
Paul was in bed for seven weeks
He got up white and fragile
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips
They used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat on the sofa chattering to his mother
The two knitted together in perfect intimacy
Mrs Morels life now rooted itself in Paul
William had been a prophet
Mrs Morel had a little present and a letter from Lily at Christmas
Mrs Morels sister had a letter at the New Year
I was at a ball last night
Some delightful people were there and I enjoyed myself thoroughly said the letter
I had every dancedid not sit out one
Mrs Morel never heard any more of her
Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time after the death of their son
He would go into a kind of daze staring wideeyed and blank across the room
Then he got up suddenly and hurried out to the Three Spots returning in his normal state
But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone past the office where his son had worked and he always avoided the cemetery
PART TWO CHAPTER VII LADANDGIRL LOVE PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn
He was friends with the two youngest boys
Edgar the eldest would not condescend at first
And Miriam also refused to be approached
She was afraid of being set at nought as by her own brothers
The girl was romantic in her soul
Everywhere was a Walter Scott heroine being loved by men with helmets or with plumes in their caps
She herself was something of a princess turned into a swinegirl in her own imagination
And she was afraid lest this boy who nevertheless looked something like a Walter Scott hero who could paint and speak French and knew what algebra meant and who went by train to Nottingham every day might consider her simply as the swinegirl unable to perceive the princess beneath so she held aloof
Her great companion was her mother
They were both browneyed and inclined to be mystical such women as treasure religion inside them breathe it in their nostrils and see the whole of life in a mist thereof
So to Miriam Christ and God made one great figure which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a tremendous sunset burned out the western sky and Ediths and Lucys and Rowenas Brian de Bois Guilberts Rob Roys and Guy Mannerings rustled the sunny leaves in the morning or sat in her bedroom aloft alone when it snowed
That was life to her
For the rest she drudged in the house which work she would not have minded had not her clean red floor been mucked up immediately by the trampling farmboots of her brothers
She madly wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe him and stifle him in her love she went to church reverently with bowed head and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the other choirgirls and from the commonsounding voice of the curate she fought with her brothers whom she considered brutal louts and she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not carry any mystical ideals cherished in his heart but only wanted to have as easy a time as he could and his meals when he was ready for them
She hated her position as swinegirl
She wanted to be considered
She wanted to learn thinking that if she could read as Paul said he could read Colomba or the Voyage autour de ma Chambre the world would have a different face for her and a deepened respect
She could not be princess by wealth or standing
So she was mad to have learning whereon to pride herself
For she was different from other folk and must not be scooped up among the common fry
Learning was the only distinction to which she thought to aspire
Her beautythat of a shy wild quiveringly sensitive thingseemed nothing to her
Even her soul so strong for rhapsody was not enough
She must have something to reinforce her pride because she felt different from other people
Paul she eyed rather wistfully
On the whole she scorned the male sex
But here was a new specimen quick light graceful who could be gentle and who could be sad and who was clever and who knew a lot and who had a death in the family
The boys poor morsel of learning exalted him almost skyhigh in her esteem
Yet she tried hard to scorn him because he would not see in her the princess but only the swinegirl
And he scarcely observed her
Then he was so ill and she felt he would be weak
Then she would be stronger than he
Then she could love him
If she could be mistress of him in his weakness take care of him if he could depend on her if she could as it were have him in her arms how she would love him
As soon as the skies brightened and plumblossom was out Paul drove off in the milkmans heavy float up to Willey Farm
Mr Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy then clicked to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly in the freshness of the morning
White clouds went on their way crowding to the back of the hills that were rousing in the springtime
The water of Nethermere lay below very blue against the seared meadows and the thorntrees
It was four and a half miles drive
Tiny buds on the hedges vivid as coppergreen were opening into rosettes and thrushes called and blackbirds shrieked and scolded
It was a new glamorous world
Miriam peeping through the kitchen window saw the horse walk through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed by the oakwood still bare
Then a youth in a heavy overcoat climbed down
He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that the goodlooking ruddy farmer handed down to him
Miriam appeared in the doorway
She was nearly sixteen very beautiful with her warm colouring her gravity her eyes dilating suddenly like an ecstasy
I say said Paul turning shyly aside your daffodils are nearly out
Isnt it early
But dont they look cold
Cold
said Miriam in her musical caressing voice
The green on their buds and he faltered into silence timidly
Let me take the rug said Miriam overgently
I can carry it he answered rather injured
But he yielded it to her
Then Mrs Leivers appeared
Im sure youre tired and cold she said
Let me take your coat
It IS heavy
You mustnt walk far in it
She helped him off with his coat
He was quite unused to such attention
She was almost smothered under its weight
Why mother laughed the farmer as he passed through the kitchen swinging the great milkchurns youve got almost more than you can manage there
She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth
The kitchen was very small and irregular
The farm had been originally a labourers cottage
And the furniture was old and battered
But Paul loved itloved the sackbag that formed the hearthrug and the funny little corner under the stairs and the small window deep in the corner through which bending a little be could see the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round hills beyond
Wont you lie down
said Mrs Leivers
Oh no Im not tired he said
Isnt it lovely coming out dont you think
I saw a sloebush in blossom and a lot of celandines
Im glad its sunny
Can I give you anything to eat or to drink
No thank you
Hows your mother
I think shes tired now
I think shes had too much to do
Perhaps in a little while shell go to Skegness with me
Then shell be able to rest
I sll be glad if she can
Yes replied Mrs Leivers
Its a wonder she isnt ill herself
Miriam was moving about preparing dinner
Paul watched everything that happened
His face was pale and thin but his eyes were quick and bright with life as ever
He watched the strange almost rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about carrying a great stewjar to the oven or looking in the saucepan
The atmosphere was different from that of his own home where everything seemed so ordinary
When Mr Leivers called loudly outside to the horse that was reaching over to feed on the rosebushes in the garden the girl started looked round with dark eyes as if something had come breaking in on her world
There was a sense of silence inside the house and out
Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale a maiden in bondage her spirit dreaming in a land far away and magical
And her discoloured old blue frock and her broken boots seemed only like the romantic rags of King Cophetuas beggarmaid
She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon her taking her all in
Instantly her broken boots and her frayed old frock hurt her
She resented his seeing everything
Even he knew that her stocking was not pulled up
She went into the scullery blushing deeply
And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at her work
She nearly dropped all she handled
When her inside dream was shaken her body quivered with trepidation
She resented that he saw so much
Mrs Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy although she was needed at her work
She was too polite to leave him
Presently she excused herself and rose
After a while she looked into the tin saucepan
Oh DEAR Miriam she cried these potatoes have boiled dry
Miriam started as if she had been stung
HAVE they mother
she cried
I shouldnt care Miriam said the mother if I hadnt trusted them to you
She peered into the pan
The girl stiffened as if from a blow
Her dark eyes dilated she remained standing in the same spot
Well she answered gripped tight in selfconscious shame Im sure I looked at them five minutes since
Yes said the mother I know its easily done
Theyre not much burned said Paul
It doesnt matter does it
Mrs Leivers looked at the youth with her brown hurt eyes
It wouldnt matter but for the boys she said to him
Only Miriam knows what a trouble they make if the potatoes are caught
Then thought Paul to himself you shouldnt let them make a trouble
After a while Edgar came in
He wore leggings and his boots were covered with earth
He was rather small rather formal for a farmer
He glanced at Paul nodded to him distantly and said Dinner ready
Nearly Edgar replied the mother apologetically
Im ready for mine said the young man taking up the newspaper and reading
Presently the rest of the family trooped in
Dinner was served
The meal went rather brutally
The overgentleness and apologetic tone of the mother brought out all the brutality of manners in the sons
Edgar tasted the potatoes moved his mouth quickly like a rabbit looked indignantly at his mother and said These potatoes are burnt mother
Yes Edgar
I forgot them for a minute
Perhaps youll have bread if you cant eat them
Edgar looked in anger across at Miriam
What was Miriam doing that she couldnt attend to them
he said
Miriam looked up
Her mouth opened her dark eyes blazed and winced but she said nothing
She swallowed her anger and her shame bowing her dark head
Im sure she was trying hard said the mother
She hasnt got sense even to boil the potatoes said Edgar
What is she kept at home for
Ony for eating everything thats left in th pantry said Maurice
They dont forget that potatopie against our Miriam laughed the father
She was utterly humiliated
The mother sat in silence suffering like some saint out of place at the brutal board
It puzzled Paul
He wondered vaguely why all this intense feeling went running because of a few burnt potatoes
The mother exalted everythingeven a bit of houseworkto the plane of a religious trust
The sons resented this they felt themselves cut away underneath and they answered with brutality and also with a sneering superciliousness
Paul was just opening out from childhood into manhood
This atmosphere where everything took a religious value came with a subtle fascination to him
There was something in the air
His own mother was logical
Here there was something different something he loved something that at times he hated
Miriam quarrelled with her brothers fiercely
Later in the afternoon when they had gone away again her mother said You disappointed me at dinnertime Miriam
The girl dropped her head
They are such BRUTES
she suddenly cried looking up with flashing eyes
But hadnt you promised not to answer them
said the mother
And I believed in you
I CANT stand it when you wrangle
But theyre so hateful
cried Miriam andand LOW
Yes dear
But how often have I asked you not to answer Edgar back
Cant you let him say what he likes
But why should he say what he likes
Arent you strong enough to bear it Miriam if even for my sake
Are you so weak that you must wrangle with them
Mrs Leivers stuck unflinchingly to this doctrine of the other cheek
She could not instil it at all into the boys
With the girls she succeeded better and Miriam was the child of her heart
The boys loathed the other cheek when it was presented to them
Miriam was often sufficiently lofty to turn it
Then they spat on her and hated her
But she walked in her proud humility living within herself
There was always this feeling of jangle and discord in the Leivers family
Although the boys resented so bitterly this eternal appeal to their deeper feelings of resignation and proud humility yet it had its effect on them
They could not establish between themselves and an outsider just the ordinary human feeling and unexaggerated friendship they were always restless for the something deeper
Ordinary folk seemed shallow to them trivial and inconsiderable
And so they were unaccustomed painfully uncouth in the simplest social intercourse suffering and yet insolent in their superiority
Then beneath was the yearning for the soulintimacy to which they could not attain because they were too dumb and every approach to close connection was blocked by their clumsy contempt of other people
They wanted genuine intimacy but they could not get even normally near to anyone because they scorned to take the first steps they scorned the triviality which forms common human intercourse
Paul fell under Mrs Leiverss spell
Everything had a religious and intensified meaning when he was with her
His soul hurt highly developed sought her as if for nourishment
Together they seemed to sift the vital fact from an experience
Miriam was her mothers daughter
In the sunshine of the afternoon mother and daughter went down the fields with him
They looked for nests
There was a jenny wrens in the hedge by the orchard
I DO want you to see this said Mrs Leivers
He crouched down and carefully put his finger through the thorns into the round door of the nest
Its almost as if you were feeling inside the live body of the bird he said its so warm
They say a bird makes its nest round like a cup with pressing its breast on it
Then how did it make the ceiling round I wonder
The nest seemed to start into life for the two women
After that Miriam came to see it every day
It seemed so close to her
Again going down the hedgeside with the girl he noticed the celandines scalloped splashes of gold on the side of the ditch
I like them he said when their petals go flat back with the sunshine
They seemed to be pressing themselves at the sun
And then the celandines ever after drew her with a little spell
Anthropomorphic as she was she stimulated him into appreciating things thus and then they lived for her
She seemed to need things kindling in her imagination or in her soul before she felt she had them
And she was cut off from ordinary life by her religious intensity which made the world for her either a nunnery garden or a paradise where sin and knowledge were not or else an ugly cruel thing
So it was in this atmosphere of subtle intimacy this meeting in their common feeling for something in Nature that their love started
Personally he was a long time before he realized her
For ten months he had to stay at home after his illness
For a while he went to Skegness with his mother and was perfectly happy
But even from the seaside he wrote long letters to Mrs Leivers about the shore and the sea
And he brought back his beloved sketches of the flat Lincoln coast anxious for them to see
Almost they would interest the Leivers more than they interested his mother
It was not his art Mrs Morel cared about it was himself and his achievement
But Mrs Leivers and her children were almost his disciples
They kindled him and made him glow to his work whereas his mothers influence was to make him quietly determined patient dogged unwearied
He soon was friends with the boys whose rudeness was only superficial
They had all when they could trust themselves a strange gentleness and lovableness
Will you come with me on to the fallow
asked Edgar rather hesitatingly
Paul went joyfully and spent the afternoon helping to hoe or to single turnips with his friend
He used to lie with the three brothers in the hay piled up in the barn and tell them about Nottingham and about Jordans
In return they taught him to milk and let him do little jobschopping hay or pulping turnipsjust as much as he liked
At midsummer he worked all through hayharvest with them and then he loved them
The family was so cut off from the world actually
They seemed somehow like les derniers fils dune race epuisee
Though the lads were strong and healthy yet they had all that oversensitiveness and hangingback which made them so lonely yet also such close delicate friends once their intimacy was won
Paul loved them dearly and they him
Miriam came later
But he had come into her life before she made any mark on his
One dull afternoon when the men were on the land and the rest at school only Miriam and her mother at home the girl said to him after having hesitated for some time Have you seen the swing
No he answered
Where
In the cowshed she replied
She always hesitated to offer or to show him anything
Men have such different standards of worth from women and her dear thingsthe valuable things to herher brothers had so often mocked or flouted
Come on then he replied jumping up
There were two cowsheds one on either side of the barn
In the lower darker shed there was standing for four cows
Hens flew scolding over the mangerwall as the youth and girl went forward for the great thick rope which hung from the beam in the darkness overhead and was pushed back over a peg in the wall
Its something like a rope
he exclaimed appreciatively and he sat down on it anxious to try it
Then immediately he rose
Come on then and have first go he said to the girl
See she answered going into the barn we put some bags on the seat and she made the swing comfortable for him
That gave her pleasure
He held the rope
Come on then he said to her
No I wont go first she answered
She stood aside in her still aloof fashion
Why
You go she pleaded
Almost for the first time in her life she had the pleasure of giving up to a man of spoiling him
Paul looked at her
All right he said sitting down
Mind out
He set off with a spring and in a moment was flying through the air almost out of the door of the shed the upper half of which was open showing outside the drizzling rain the filthy yard the cattle standing disconsolate against the black cartshed and at the back of all the greygreen wall of the wood
She stood below in her crimson tamoshanter and watched
He looked down at her and she saw his blue eyes sparkling
Its a treat of a swing he said
Yes
He was swinging through the air every bit of him swinging like a bird that swoops for joy of movement
And he looked down at her
Her crimson cap hung over her dark curls her beautiful warm face so still in a kind of brooding was lifted towards him
It was dark and rather cold in the shed
Suddenly a swallow came down from the high roof and darted out of the door
I didnt know a bird was watching he called
He swung negligently
She could feel him falling and lifting through the air as if he were lying on some force
Now Ill die he said in a detached dreamy voice as though he were the dying motion of the swing
She watched him fascinated
Suddenly he put on the brake and jumped out
Ive had a long turn he said
But its a treat of a swingits a real treat of a swing
Miriam was amused that he took a swing so seriously and felt so warmly over it
No you go on she said
Why dont you want one
he asked astonished
Well not much
Ill have just a little
She sat down whilst he kept the bags in place for her
Its so ripping
he said setting her in motion
Keep your heels up or theyll bang the manger wall
She felt the accuracy with which he caught her exactly at the right moment and the exactly proportionate strength of his thrust and she was afraid
Down to her bowels went the hot wave of fear
She was in his hands
Again firm and inevitable came the thrust at the right moment
She gripped the rope almost swooning
Ha
she laughed in fear
No higher
But youre not a BIT high he remonstrated
But no higher
He heard the fear in her voice and desisted
Her heart melted in hot pain when the moment came for him to thrust her forward again
But he left her alone
She began to breathe
Wont you really go any farther
he asked
Should I keep you there
No let me go by myself she answered
He moved aside and watched her
Why youre scarcely moving he said
She laughed slightly with shame and in a moment got down
They say if you can swing you wont be seasick he said as he mounted again
I dont believe I should ever be seasick
Away he went
There was something fascinating to her in him
For the moment he was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff not a particle of him that did not swing
She could never lose herself so nor could her brothers
It roused a warmth in her
It was almost as if he were a flame that had lit a warmth in her whilst he swung in the middle air
And gradually the intimacy with the family concentrated for Paul on three personsthe mother Edgar and Miriam
To the mother he went for that sympathy and that appeal which seemed to draw him out
Edgar was his very close friend
And to Miriam he more or less condescended because she seemed so humble
But the girl gradually sought him out
If he brought up his sketchbook it was she who pondered longest over the last picture
Then she would look up at him
Suddenly her dark eyes alight like water that shakes with a stream of gold in the dark she would ask Why do I like this so
Always something in his breast shrank from these close intimate dazzled looks of hers
Why DO you
he asked
I dont know
It seems so true
Its becauseits because there is scarcely any shadow in it its more shimmery as if Id painted the shimmering protoplasm in the leaves and everywhere and not the stiffness of the shape
That seems dead to me
Only this shimmeriness is the real living
The shape is a dead crust
The shimmer is inside really
And she with her little finger in her mouth would ponder these sayings
They gave her a feeling of life again and vivified things which had meant nothing to her
She managed to find some meaning in his struggling abstract speeches
And they were the medium through which she came distinctly at her beloved objects
Another day she sat at sunset whilst he was painting some pinetrees which caught the red glare from the west
He had been quiet
There you are
he said suddenly
I wanted that
Now look at them and tell me are they pine trunks or are they red coals standingup pieces of fire in that darkness
Theres Gods burning bush for you that burned not away
Miriam looked and was frightened
But the pine trunks were wonderful to her and distinct
He packed his box and rose
Suddenly he looked at her
Why are you always sad
he asked her
Sad
she exclaimed looking up at him with startled wonderful brown eyes
Yes he replied
You are always sad
I am notoh not a bit
she cried
But even your joy is like a flame coming off of sadness he persisted
Youre never jolly or even just all right
No she pondered
I wonderwhy
Because youre not because youre different inside like a pinetree and then you flare up but youre not just like an ordinary tree with fidgety leaves and jolly He got tangled up in his own speech but she brooded on it and he had a strange roused sensation as if his feelings were new
She got so near him
It was a strange stimulant
Then sometimes he hated her
Her youngest brother was only five
He was a frail lad with immense brown eyes in his quaint fragile faceone of Reynoldss Choir of Angels with a touch of elf
Often Miriam kneeled to the child and drew him to her
Eh my Hubert
she sang in a voice heavy and surcharged with love
Eh my Hubert
And folding him in her arms she swayed slightly from side to side with love her face half lifted her eyes half closed her voice drenched with love
Dont
said the child uneasydont Miriam
Yes you love me dont you
she murmured deep in her throat almost as if she were in a trance and swaying also as if she were swooned in an ecstasy of love
Dont
repeated the child a frown on his clear brow
You love me dont you
she murmured
What do you make such a FUSS for
cried Paul all in suffering because of her extreme emotion
Why cant you be ordinary with him
She let the child go and rose and said nothing
Her intensity which would leave no emotion on a normal plane irritated the youth into a frenzy
And this fearful naked contact of her on small occasions shocked him
He was used to his mothers reserve
And on such occasions he was thankful in his heart and soul that he had his mother so sane and wholesome
All the life of Miriams body was in her eyes which were usually dark as a dark church but could flame with light like a conflagration
Her face scarcely ever altered from its look of brooding
She might have been one of the women who went with Mary when Jesus was dead
Her body was not flexible and living
She walked with a swing rather heavily her head bowed forward pondering
She was not clumsy and yet none of her movements seemed quite THE movement
Often when wiping the dishes she would stand in bewilderment and chagrin because she had pulled in two halves a cup or a tumbler
It was as if in her fear and selfmistrust she put too much strength into the effort
There was no looseness or abandon about her
Everything was gripped stiff with intensity and her effort overcharged closed in on itself
She rarely varied from her swinging forward intense walk
Occasionally she ran with Paul down the fields
Then her eyes blazed naked in a kind of ecstasy that frightened him
But she was physically afraid
If she were getting over a stile she gripped his hands in a little hard anguish and began to lose her presence of mind
And he could not persuade her to jump from even a small height
Her eyes dilated became exposed and palpitating
No
she cried half laughing in terrorno
You shall
he cried once and jerking her forward he brought her falling from the fence
But her wild Ah
of pain as if she were losing consciousness cut him
She landed on her feet safely and afterwards had courage in this respect
She was very much dissatisfied with her lot
Dont you like being at home
Paul asked her surprised
Who would
she answered low and intense
What is it
Im all day cleaning what the boys make just as bad in five minutes
I dont WANT to be at home
What do you want then
I want to do something
I want a chance like anybody else
Why should 1 because Im a girl be kept at home and not allowed to be anything
What chance HAVE I
Chance of what
Of knowing anythingof learning of doing anything
Its not fair because Im a woman
She seemed very bitter
Paul wondered
In his own home Annie was almost glad to be a girl
She had not so much responsibility things were lighter for her
She never wanted to be other than a girl
But Miriam almost fiercely wished she were a man
And yet she hated men at the same time
But its as well to be a woman as a man he said frowning
Ha
Is it
Men have everything
I should think women ought to be as glad to be women as men are to be men he answered
No
she shook her headno
Everything the men have
But what do you want
he asked
I want to learn
Why SHOULD it be that I know nothing
What
such as mathematics and French
Why SHOULDNT I know mathematics
Yes
she cried her eye expanding in a kind of defiance
Well you can learn as much as I know he said
Ill teach you if you like
Her eyes dilated
She mistrusted him as teacher
Would you
he asked
Her head had dropped and she was sucking her finger broodingly
Yes she said hesitatingly
He used to tell his mother all these things
Im going to teach Miriam algebra he said
Well replied Mrs Morel I hope shell get fat on it
When he went up to the farm on the Monday evening it was drawing twilight
Miriam was just sweeping up the kitchen and was kneeling at the hearth when he entered
Everyone was out but her
She looked round at him flushed her dark eyes shining her fine hair falling about her face
Hello
she said soft and musical
I knew it was you
How
I knew your step
Nobody treads so quick and firm
He sat down sighing
Ready to do some algebra
he asked drawing a little book from his pocket
But He could feel her backing away
You said you wanted he insisted
Tonight though
she faltered
But I came on purpose
And if you want to learn it you must begin
She took up her ashes in the dustpan and looked at him half tremulously laughing
Yes but tonight
You see I havent thought of it
Well my goodness
Take the ashes and come
He went and sat on the stone bench in the backyard where the big milkcans were standing tipped up to air
The men were in the cowsheds
He could hear the little singsong of the milk spurting into the pails
Presently she came bringing some big greenish apples
You know you like them she said
He took a bite
Sit down he said with his mouth full
She was shortsighted and peered over his shoulder
It irritated him
He gave her the book quickly
Here he said
Its only letters for figures
You put down a instead of 2 or 6
They worked he talking she with her head down on the book
He was quick and hasty
She never answered
Occasionally when he demanded of her Do you see
she looked up at him her eyes wide with the halflaugh that comes of fear
Dont you
he cried
He had been too fast
But she said nothing
He questioned her more then got hot
It made his blood rouse to see her there as it were at his mercy her mouth open her eyes dilated with laughter that was afraid apologetic ashamed
Then Edgar came along with two buckets of milk
Hello
he said
What are you doing
Algebra replied Paul
Algebra
repeated Edgar curiously
Then he passed on with a laugh
Paul took a bite at his forgotten apple looked at the miserable cabbages in the garden pecked into lace by the fowls and he wanted to pull them up
Then he glanced at Miriam
She was poring over the book seemed absorbed in it yet trembling lest she could not get at it
It made him cross
She was ruddy and beautiful
Yet her soul seemed to be intensely supplicating
The algebrabook she closed shrinking knowing he was angered and at the same instant he grew gentle seeing her hurt because she did not understand
But things came slowly to her
And when she held herself in a grip seemed so utterly humble before the lesson it made his blood rouse
He stormed at her got ashamed continued the lesson and grew furious again abusing her
She listened in silence
Occasionally very rarely she defended herself
Her liquid dark eyes blazed at him
You dont give me time to learn it she said
All right he answered throwing the book on the table and lighting a cigarette
Then after a while he went back to her repentant
So the lessons went
He was always either in a rage or very gentle
What do you tremble your SOUL before it for
he cried
You dont learn algebra with your blessed soul
Cant you look at it with your clear simple wits
Often when he went again into the kitchen Mrs Leivers would look at him reproachfully saying Paul dont be so hard on Miriam
She may not be quick but Im sure she tries
I cant help it he said rather pitiably
I go off like it
You dont mind me Miriam do you
he asked of the girl later
No she reassured him in her beautiful deep tonesno I dont mind
Dont mind me its my fault
But in spite of himself his blood began to boil with her
It was strange that no one else made him in such fury
He flared against her
Once he threw the pencil in her face
There was a silence
She turned her face slightly aside
I didnt he began but got no farther feeling weak in all his bones
She never reproached him or was angry with him
He was often cruelly ashamed
But still again his anger burst like a bubble surcharged and still when he saw her eager silent as it were blind face he felt he wanted to throw the pencil in it and still when he saw her hand trembling and her mouth parted with suffering his heart was scalded with pain for her
And because of the intensity to which she roused him he sought her
Then he often avoided her and went with Edgar
Miriam and her brother were naturally antagonistic
Edgar was a rationalist who was curious and had a sort of scientific interest in life
It was a great bitterness to Miriam to see herself deserted by Paul for Edgar who seemed so much lower
But the youth was very happy with her elder brother
The two men spent afternoons together on the land or in the loft doing carpentry when it rained
And they talked together or Paul taught Edgar the songs he himself had learned from Annie at the piano
And often all the men Mr Leivers as well had bitter debates on the nationalizing of the land and similar problems
Paul had already heard his mothers views and as these were as yet his own he argued for her
Miriam attended and took part but was all the time waiting until it should be over and a personal communication might begin
After all she said within herself if the land were nationalized Edgar and Paul and I would be just the same
So she waited for the youth to come back to her
He was studying for his painting
He loved to sit at home alone with his mother at night working and working
She sewed or read
Then looking up from his task he would rest his eyes for a moment on her face that was bright with living warmth and he returned gladly to his work
I can do my best things when you sit there in your rockingchair mother he said
Im sure
she exclaimed sniffing with mock scepticism
But she felt it was so and her heart quivered with brightness
For many hours she sat still slightly conscious of him labouring away whilst she worked or read her book
And he with all his souls intensity directing his pencil could feel her warmth inside him like strength
They were both very happy so and both unconscious of it
These times that meant so much and which were real living they almost ignored
He was conscious only when stimulated
A sketch finished he always wanted to take it to Miriam
Then he was stimulated into knowledge of the work he had produced unconsciously
In contact with Miriam he gained insight his vision went deeper
From his mother he drew the lifewarmth the strength to produce Miriam urged this warmth into intensity like a white light
When he returned to the factory the conditions of work were better
He had Wednesday afternoon off to go to the Art School Miss Jordans provisionreturning in the evening
Then the factory closed at six instead of eight on Thursday and Friday evenings
One evening in the summer Miriam and he went over the fields by Herods Farm on their way from the library home
So it was only three miles to Willey Farm
There was a yellow glow over the mowinggrass and the sorrelheads burned crimson
Gradually as they walked along the high land the gold in the west sank down to red the red to crimson and then the chill blue crept up against the glow
They came out upon the high road to Alfreton which ran white between the darkening fields
There Paul hesitated
It was two miles home for him one mile forward for Miriam
They both looked up the road that ran in shadow right under the glow of the northwest sky
On the crest of the hill Selby with its stark houses and the uppricked headstocks of the pit stood in black silhouette small against the sky
He looked at his watch
Nine oclock
he said
The pair stood loth to part hugging their books
The wood is so lovely now she said
I wanted you to see it
He followed her slowly across the road to the white gate
They grumble so if Im late he said
But youre not doing anything wrong she answered impatiently
He followed her across the nibbled pasture in the dusk
There was a coolness in the wood a scent of leaves of honeysuckle and a twilight
The two walked in silence
Night came wonderfully there among the throng of dark treetrunks
He looked round expectant
She wanted to show him a certain wildrose bush she had discovered
She knew it was wonderful
And yet till he had seen it she felt it had not come into her soul
Only he could make it her own immortal
She was dissatisfied
Dew was already on the paths
In the old oakwood a mist was rising and he hesitated wondering whether one whiteness were a strand of fog or only campionflowers pallid in a cloud
By the time they came to the pinetrees Miriam was getting very eager and very tense
Her bush might be gone
She might not be able to find it and she wanted it so much
Almost passionately she wanted to be with him when be stood before the flowers
They were going to have a communion togethersomething that thrilled her something holy
He was walking beside her in silence
They were very near to each other
She trembled and he listened vaguely anxious
Coming to the edge of the wood they saw the sky in front like motherofpearl and the earth growing dark
Somewhere on the outermost branches of the pinewood the honeysuckle was streaming scent
Where
he asked
Down the middle path she murmured quivering
When they turned the corner of the path she stood still
In the wide walk between the pines gazing rather frightened she could distinguish nothing for some moments the greying light robbed things of their colour
Then she saw her bush
Ah
she cried hastening forward
It was very still
The tree was tall and straggling
It had thrown its briers over a hawthornbush and its long streamers trailed thick right down to the grass splashing the darkness everywhere with great spilt stars pure white
In bosses of ivory and in large splashed stars the roses gleamed on the darkness of foliage and stems and grass
Paul and Miriam stood close together silent and watched
Point after point the steady roses shone out to them seeming to kindle something in their souls
The dusk came like smoke around and still did not put out the roses
Paul looked into Miriams eyes
She was pale and expectant with wonder her lips were parted and her dark eyes lay open to him
His look seemed to travel down into her
Her soul quivered
It was the communion she wanted
He turned aside as if pained
He turned to the bush
They seem as if they walk like butterflies and shake themselves he said
She looked at her roses
They were white some incurved and holy others expanded in an ecstasy
The tree was dark as a shadow
She lifted her hand impulsively to the flowers she went forward and touched them in worship
Let us go he said
There was a cool scent of ivory rosesa white virgin scent
Something made him feel anxious and imprisoned
The two walked in silence
Till Sunday he said quietly and left her and she walked home slowly feeling her soul satisfied with the holiness of the night
He stumbled down the path
And as soon as he was out of the wood in the free open meadow where he could breathe he started to run as fast as he could
It was like a delicious delirium in his veins
Always when he went with Miriam and it grew rather late he knew his mother was fretting and getting angry about himwhy he could not understand
As he went into the house flinging down his cap his mother looked up at the clock
She had been sitting thinking because a chill to her eyes prevented her reading
She could feel Paul being drawn away by this girl
And she did not care for Miriam
She is one of those who will want to suck a mans soul out till he has none of his own left she said to herself and he is just such a gaby as to let himself be absorbed
She will never let him become a man she never will
So while he was away with Miriam Mrs Morel grew more and more worked up
She glanced at the clock and said coldly and rather tired You have been far enough tonight
His soul warm and exposed from contact with the girl shrank
You must have been right home with her his mother continued
He would not answer
Mrs Morel looking at him quickly saw his hair was damp on his forehead with haste saw him frowning in his heavy fashion resentfully
She must be wonderfully fascinating that you cant get away from her but must go trailing eight miles at this time of night
He was hurt between the past glamour with Miriam and the knowledge that his mother fretted
He had meant not to say anything to refuse to answer
But he could not harden his heart to ignore his mother
I DO like to talk to her he answered irritably
Is there nobody else to talk to
You wouldnt say anything if I went with Edgar
You know I should
You know whoever you went with I should say it was too far for you to go trailing late at night when youve been to Nottingham
Besidesher voice suddenly flashed into anger and contemptit is disgustingbits of lads and girls courting
It is NOT courting he cried
I dont know what else you call it
Its not
Do you think we SPOON and do
We only talk
Till goodness knows what time and distance was the sarcastic rejoinder
Paul snapped at the laces of his boots angrily
What are you so mad about
he asked
Because you dont like her
I dont say I dont like her
But I dont hold with children keeping company and never did
But you dont mind our Annie going out with Jim Inger
Theyve more sense than you two
Why
Our Annies not one of the deep sort
He failed to see the meaning of this remark
But his mother looked tired
She was never so strong after Williams death and her eyes hurt her
Well he said its so pretty in the country
Mr Sleath asked about you
He said hed missed you
Are you a bit better
I ought to have been in bed a long time ago she replied
Why mother you know you wouldnt have gone before quarterpast ten
Oh yes I should
Oh little woman youd say anything now youre disagreeable with me wouldnt you
He kissed her forehead that he knew so well the deep marks between the brows the rising of the fine hair greying now and the proud setting of the temples
His hand lingered on her shoulder after his kiss
Then he went slowly to bed
He had forgotten Miriam he only saw how his mothers hair was lifted back from her warm broad brow
And somehow she was hurt
Then the next time he saw Miriam he said to her Dont let me be late tonightnot later than ten oclock
My mother gets so upset
Miriam dropped her bead brooding
Why does she get upset
she asked
Because she says I oughtnt to be out late when I have to get up early
Very well
said Miriam rather quietly with just a touch of a sneer
He resented that
And he was usually late again
That there was any love growing between him and Miriam neither of them would have acknowledged
He thought he was too sane for such sentimentality and she thought herself too lofty
They both were late in coming to maturity and psychical ripeness was much behind even the physical
Miriam was exceedingly sensitive as her mother had always been
The slightest grossness made her recoil almost in anguish
Her brothers were brutal but never coarse in speech
The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside
But perhaps because of the continual business of birth and of begetting which goes on upon every farm Miriam was the more hypersensitive to the matter and her blood was chastened almost to disgust of the faintest suggestion of such intercourse
Paul took his pitch from her and their intimacy went on in an utterly blanched and chaste fashion
It could never be mentioned that the mare was in foal
When he was nineteen he was earning only twenty shillings a week but he was happy
His painting went well and life went well enough
On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock Stone
There were three lads of his own age then Annie and Arthur Miriam and Geoffrey
Arthur apprenticed as an electrician in Nottingham was home for the holiday
Morel as usual was up early whistling and sawing in the yard
At seven oclock the family heard him buy threepennyworth of hotcross buns he talked with gusto to the little girl who brought them calling her my darling
He turned away several boys who came with more buns telling them they had been kested by a little lass
Then Mrs Morel got up and the family straggled down
It was an immense luxury to everybody this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary time on a weekday
And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast and had the meal unwashed sitting in their shirtsleeves
This was another holiday luxury
The room was warm
Everything felt free of care and anxiety
There was a sense of plenty in the house
While the boys were reading Mrs Morel went into the garden
They were now in another house an old one near the Scargill Street home which had been left soon after William had died
Directly came an excited cry from the garden Paul
Paul
come and look
It was his mothers voice
He threw down his book and went out
There was a long garden that ran to a field
It was a grey cold day with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire
Two fields away Bestwood began with a jumble of roofs and red houseends out of which rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational Chapel
And beyond went woods and hills right away to the pale grey heights of the Pennine Chain
Paul looked down the garden for his mother
Her head appeared among the young currantbushes
Come here
she cried
What for
he answered
Come and see
She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees
Paul went up
To think she said that here I might never have seen them
Her son went to her side
Under the fence in a little bed was a ravel of poor grassy leaves such as come from very immature bulbs and three scyllas in bloom
Mrs Morel pointed to the deep blue flowers
Now just see those
she exclaimed
I was looking at the currant bushes when thinks I to myself Theres something very blue is it a bit of sugarbag
and there behold you
Sugarbag
Three glories of the snow and such beauties
But where on earth did they come from
I dont know said Paul
Well thats a marvel now
I THOUGHT I knew every weed and blade in this garden
But HAVENT they done well
You see that gooseberrybush just shelters them
Not nipped not touched
He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little blue flowers
Theyre a glorious colour
he said
Arent they
she cried
I guess they come from Switzerland where they say they have such lovely things
Fancy them against the snow
But where have they come from
They cant have BLOWN here can they
Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash of bulbs to mature
And you never told me she said
No
I thought Id leave it till they might flower
And now you see
I might have missed them
And Ive never had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life
She was full of excitement and elation
The garden was an endless joy to her
Paul was thankful for her sake at last to be in a house with a long garden that went down to a field
Every morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering about in it
And it was true she knew every weed and blade
Everybody turned up for the walk
Food was packed and they set off a merry delighted party
They hung over the wall of the millrace dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel and watched it shoot out on the other
They stood on the footbridge over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming coldly
You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at halfpast six
said Leonard whose father was a signalman
Lad but she doesnt half buzz
and the little party looked up the lines one way to London and the other way to Scotland and they felt the touch of these two magical places
In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the publichouses to open
It was a town of idleness and lounging
At Stanton Gate the iron foundry blazed
Over everything there were great discussions
At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire into Nottinghamshire
They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinnertime
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston
They had expected a venerable and dignified monument
They found a little gnarled twisted stump of rock something like a decayed mushroom standing out pathetically on the side of a field
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their initials L W and R P in the old red sandstone but Paul desisted because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about initialcarvers who could find no other road to immortality
Then all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round
Everywhere in the field below factory girls and lads were eating lunch or sporting about
Beyond was the garden of an old manor
It had yewhedges and thick clumps and borders of yellow crocuses round the lawn
See said Paul to Miriam what a quiet garden
She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses then she looked gratefully
He had not seemed to belong to her among all these others he was different thennot her Paul who understood the slightest quiver of her innermost soul but something else speaking another language than hers
How it hurt her and deadened her very perceptions
Only when he came right back to her leaving his other his lesser self as she thought would she feel alive again
And now he asked her to look at this garden wanting the contact with her again
Impatient of the set in the field she turned to the quiet lawn surrounded by sheaves of shutup crocuses
A feeling of stillness almost of ecstasy came over her
It felt almost as if she were alone with him in this garden
Then he left her again and joined the others
Soon they started home
Miriam loitered behind alone
She did not fit in with the others she could very rarely get into human relations with anyone so her friend her companion her lover was Nature
She saw the sun declining wanly
In the dusky cold hedgerows were some red leaves
She lingered to gather them tenderly passionately
The love in her fingertips caressed the leaves the passion in her heart came to a glow upon the leaves
Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road and she hurried forward
Turning a corner in the lane she came upon Paul who stood bent over something his mind fixed on it working away steadily patiently a little hopelessly
She hesitated in her approach to watch
He remained concentrated in the middle of the road
Beyond one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make him stand out in dark relief
She saw him slender and firm as if the setting sun had given him to her
A deep pain took hold of her and she knew she must love him
And she had discovered him discovered in him a rare potentiality discovered his loneliness
Quivering as at some annunciation she went slowly forward
At last he looked up
Why he exclaimed gratefully have you waited for me
She saw a deep shadow in his eyes
What is it
she asked
The spring broken here and he showed her where his umbrella was injured
Instantly with some shame she knew he had not done the damage himself but that Geoffrey was responsible
It is only an old umbrella isnt it
she asked
She wondered why he who did not usually trouble over trifles made such a mountain of this molehill
But it was Williams an my mother cant help but know he said quietly still patiently working at the umbrella
The words went through Miriam like a blade
This then was the confirmation of her vision of him
She looked at him
But there was about him a certain reserve and she dared not comfort him not even speak softly to him
Come on he said
I cant do it and they went in silence along the road
That same evening they were walking along under the trees by Nether Green
He was talking to her fretfully seemed to be struggling to convince himself
You know he said with an effort if one person loves the other does
Ah
she answered
Like mother said to me when I was little Love begets love
Yes something like that I think it MUST be
I hope so because if it were not love might be a very terrible thing she said
Yes but it ISat least with most people he answered
And Miriam thinking he had assured himself felt strong in herself
She always regarded that sudden coming upon him in the lane as a revelation
And this conversation remained graven in her mind as one of the letters of the law
Now she stood with him and for him
When about this time he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing insult she stuck to him and believed he was right
And at this time she dreamed dreams of him vivid unforgettable
These dreams came again later on developed to a more subtle psychological stage
On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion to Wingfield Manor
It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a train at Sethley Bridge amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday crowd
They left the train at Alfreton
Paul was interested in the street and in the colliers with their dogs
Here was a new race of miners
Miriam did not live till they came to the church
They were all rather timid of entering with their bags of food for fear of being turned out
Leonard a comic thin fellow went first Paul who would have died rather than be sent back went last
The place was decorated for Easter
In the font hundreds of white narcissi seemed to be growing
The air was dim and coloured from the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies and narcissi
In that atmosphere Miriams soul came into a glow
Paul was afraid of the things he mustnt do and he was sensitive to the feel of the place
Miriam turned to him
He answered
They were together
He would not go beyond the Communionrail
She loved him for that
Her soul expanded into prayer beside him
He felt the strange fascination of shadowy religious places
All his latent mysticism quivered into life
She was drawn to him
He was a prayer along with her
Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads
They at once became awkward in conversation with her
So usually she was silent
It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor
All things shone softly in the sun which was wonderfully warm and enlivening
Celandines and violets were out
Everybody was tiptop full with happiness
The glitter of the ivy the soft atmospheric grey of the castle walls the gentleness of everything near the ruin was perfect
The manor is of hard pale grey stone and the other walls are blank and calm
The young folk were in raptures
They went in trepidation almost afraid that the delight of exploring this ruin might be denied them
In the first courtyard within the high broken walls were farmcarts with their shafts lying idle on the ground the tyres of the wheels brilliant with goldred rust
It was very still
All eagerly paid their sixpences and went timidly through the fine clean arch of the inner courtyard
They were shy
Here on the pavement where the hall had been an old thorn tree was budding
All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were in the shadow around them
After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin
This time the girls went with the boys who could act as guides and expositors
There was one tall tower in a corner rather tottering where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned
Think of the Queen going up here
said Miriam in a low voice as she climbed the hollow stairs
If she could get up said Paul for she had rheumatism like anything
I reckon they treated her rottenly
You dont think she deserved it
asked Miriam
No I dont
She was only lively
They continued to mount the winding staircase
A high wind blowing through the loopholes went rushing up the shaft and filled the girls skirts like a balloon so that she was ashamed until he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her
He did it perfectly simply as he would have picked up her glove
She remembered this always
Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out old and handsome
Also there were a few chill gillivers in pale cold bud
Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy but he would not let her
Instead she had to wait behind him and take from him each spray as he gathered it and held it to her each one separately in the purest manner of chivalry
The tower seemed to rock in the wind
They looked over miles and miles of wooded country and country with gleams of pasture
The crypt underneath the manor was beautiful and in perfect preservation
Paul made a drawing Miriam stayed with him
She was thinking of Mary Queen of Scots looking with her strained hopeless eyes that could not understand misery over the hills whence no help came or sitting in this crypt being told of a God as cold as the place she sat in
They set off again gaily looking round on their beloved manor that stood so clean and big on its hill
Supposing you could have THAT farm said Paul to Miriam
Yes
Wouldnt it be lovely to come and see you
They were now in the bare country of stone walls which he loved and which though only ten miles from home seemed so foreign to Miriam
The party was straggling
As they were crossing a large meadow that sloped away from the sun along a path embedded with innumerable tiny glittering points Paul walking alongside laced his fingers in the strings of the bag Miriam was carrying and instantly she felt Annie behind watchful and jealous
But the meadow was bathed in a glory of sunshine and the path was jewelled and it was seldom that he gave her any sign
She held her fingers very still among the strings of the bag his fingers touching and the place was golden as a vision
At last they came into the straggling grey village of Crich that lies high
Beyond the village was the famous Crich Stand that Paul could see from the garden at home
The party pushed on
Great expanse of country spread around and below
The lads were eager to get to the top of the hill
It was capped by a round knoll half of which was by now cut away and on the top of which stood an ancient monument sturdy and squat for signalling in old days far down into the level lands of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire
It was blowing so hard high up there in the exposed place that the only way to be safe was to stand nailed by the wind to the wan of the tower
At their feet fell the precipice where the limestone was quarried away
Below was a jumble of hills and tiny villagesMattock Ambergate Stoney Middleton
The lads were eager to spy out the church of Bestwood far away among the rather crowded country on the left
They were disgusted that it seemed to stand on a plain
They saw the hills of Derbyshire fall into the monotony of the Midlands that swept away South
Miriam was somewhat scared by the wind but the lads enjoyed it
They went on miles and miles to Whatstandwell
All the food was eaten everybody was hungry and there was very little money to get home with
But they managed to procure a loaf and a currantloaf which they hacked to pieces with shutknives and ate sitting on the wall near the bridge watching the bright Derwent rushing by and the brakes from Matlock pulling up at the inn
Paul was now pale with weariness
He had been responsible for the party all day and now he was done
Miriam understood and kept close to him and he left himself in her hands
They had an hour to wait at Ambergate Station
Trains came crowded with excursionists returning to Manchester Birmingham and London
We might be going therefolk easily might think were going that far said Paul
They got back rather late
Miriam walking home with Geoffrey watched the moon rise big and red and misty
She felt something was fulfilled in her
She had an elder sister Agatha who was a schoolteacher
Between the two girls was a feud
Miriam considered Agatha worldly
And she wanted herself to be a schoolteacher
One Saturday afternoon Agatha and Miriam were upstairs dressing
Their bedroom was over the stable
It was a low room not very large and bare
Miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction of Veroneses St Catherine
She loved the woman who sat in the window dreaming
Her own windows were too small to sit in
But the front one was dripped over with honeysuckle and virginia creeper and looked upon the treetops of the oakwood across the yard while the little back window no bigger than a handkerchief was a loophole to the east to the dawn beating up against the beloved round hills
The two sisters did not talk much to each other
Agatha who was fair and small and determined had rebelled against the home atmosphere against the doctrine of the other cheek
She was out in the world now in a fair way to be independent
And she insisted on worldly values on appearance on manners on position which Miriam would fain have ignored
Both girls liked to be upstairs out of the way when Paul came
They preferred to come running down open the stairfoot door and see him watching expectant of them
Miriam stood painfully pulling over her head a rosary he had given her
It caught in the fine mesh of her hair
But at last she had it on and the redbrown wooden beads looked well against her cool brown neck
She was a welldeveloped girl and very handsome
But in the little lookingglass nailed against the whitewashed wall she could only see a fragment of herself at a time
Agatha had bought a little mirror of her own which she propped up to suit herself
Miriam was near the window
Suddenly she heard the wellknown click of the chain and she saw Paul fling open the gate push his bicycle into the yard
She saw him look at the house and she shrank away
He walked in a nonchalant fashion and his bicycle went with him as if it were a live thing
Pauls come
she exclaimed
Arent you glad
said Agatha cuttingly
Miriam stood still in amazement and bewilderment
Well arent you
she asked
Yes but Im not going to let him see it and think I wanted him
Miriam was startled
She heard him putting his bicycle in the stable underneath and talking to Jimmy who had been a pithorse and who was seedy
Well Jimmy my lad how are ter
Nobbut sick an sadly like
Why then its a shame my owd lad
She heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted its head from the lads caress
How she loved to listen when he thought only the horse could hear
But there was a serpent in her Eden
She searched earnestly in herself to see if she wanted Paul Morel
She felt there would be some disgrace in it
Full of twisted feeling she was afraid she did want him
She stood selfconvicted
Then came an agony of new shame
She shrank within herself in a coil of torture
Did she want Paul Morel and did he know she wanted him
What a subtle infamy upon her
She felt as if her whole soul coiled into knots of shame
Agatha was dressed first and ran downstairs
Miriam heard her greet the lad gaily knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes became with that tone
She herself would have felt it bold to have greeted him in such wise
Yet there she stood under the selfaccusation of wanting him tied to that stake of torture
In bitter perplexity she kneeled down and prayed O Lord let me not love Paul Morel
Keep me from loving him if I ought not to love him
Something anomalous in the prayer arrested her
She lifted her head and pondered
How could it be wrong to love him
Love was Gods gift
And yet it caused her shame
That was because of him Paul Morel
But then it was not his affair it was her own between herself and God
She was to be a sacrifice
But it was Gods sacrifice not Paul Morels or her own
After a few minutes she hid her face in the pillow again and said But Lord if it is Thy will that I should love him make me love himas Christ would who died for the souls of men
Make me love him splendidly because he is Thy son
She remained kneeling for some time quite still and deeply moved her black hair against the red squares and the lavendersprigged squares of the patchwork quilt
Prayer was almost essential to her
Then she fell into that rapture of selfsacrifice identifying herself with a God who was sacrificed which gives to so many human souls their deepest bliss
When she went downstairs Paul was lying back in an armchair holding forth with much vehemence to Agatha who was scorning a little painting he had brought to show her
Miriam glanced at the two and avoided their levity
She went into the parlour to be alone
It was teatime before she was able to speak to Paul and then her manner was so distant he thought he had offended her
Miriam discontinued her practice of going each Thursday evening to the library in Bestwood
After calling for Paul regularly during the whole spring a number of trifling incidents and tiny insults from his family awakened her to their attitude towards her and she decided to go no more
So she announced to Paul one evening she would not call at his house again for him on Thursday nights
Why
he asked very short
Nothing
Only Id rather not
Very well
But she faltered if youd care to meet me we could still go together
Meet you where
Somewherewhere you like
I shant meet you anywhere
I dont see why you shouldnt keep calling for me
But if you wont I dont want to meet you
So the Thursday evenings which had been so precious to her and to him were dropped
He worked instead
Mrs Morel sniffed with satisfaction at this arrangement
He would not have it that they were lovers
The intimacy between them had been kept so abstract such a matter of the soul all thought and weary struggle into consciousness that he saw it only as a platonic friendship
He stoutly denied there was anything else between them
Miriam was silent or else she very quietly agreed
He was a fool who did not know what was happening to himself
By tacit agreement they ignored the remarks and insinuations of their acquaintances
We arent lovers we are friends he said to her
WE know it
Let them talk
What does it matter what they say
Sometimes as they were walking together she slipped her arm timidly into his
But he always resented it and she knew it
It caused a violent conflict in him
With Miriam he was always on the high plane of abstraction when his natural fire of love was transmitted into the fine stream of thought
She would have it so
If he were jolly and as she put it flippant she waited till he came back to her till the change had taken place in him again and he was wrestling with his own soul frowning passionate in his desire for understanding
And in this passion for understanding her soul lay close to his she had him all to herself
But he must be made abstract first
Then if she put her arm in his it caused him almost torture
His consciousness seemed to split
The place where she was touching him ran hot with friction
He was one internecine battle and he became cruel to her because of it
One evening in midsummer Miriam called at the house warm from climbing
Paul was alone in the kitchen his mother could be heard moving about upstairs
Come and look at the sweetpeas he said to the girl
They went into the garden
The sky behind the townlet and the church was orangered the flowergarden was flooded with a strange warm light that lifted every leaf into significance
Paul passed along a fine row of sweetpeas gathering a blossom here and there all cream and pale blue
Miriam followed breathing the fragrance
To her flowers appealed with such strength she felt she must make them part of herself
When she bent and breathed a flower it was as if she and the flower were loving each other
Paul hated her for it
There seemed a sort of exposure about the action something too intimate
When he had got a fair bunch they returned to the house
He listened for a moment to his mothers quiet movement upstairs then he said Come here and let me pin them in for you
He arranged them two or three at a time in the bosom of her dress stepping back now and then to see the effect
You know he said taking the pin out of his mouth a woman ought always to arrange her flowers before her glass
Miriam laughed
She thought flowers ought to be pinned in ones dress without any care
That Paul should take pains to fix her flowers for her was his whim
He was rather offended at her laughter
Some women dothose who look decent he said
Miriam laughed again but mirthlessly to hear him thus mix her up with women in a general way
From most men she would have ignored it
But from him it hurt her
He had nearly finished arranging the flowers when he heard his mothers footstep on the stairs
Hurriedly he pushed in the last pin and turned away
Dont let mater know he said
Miriam picked up her books and stood in the doorway looking with chagrin at the beautiful sunset
She would call for Paul no more she said
Goodevening Mrs Morel she said in a deferential way
She sounded as if she felt she had no right to be there
Oh is it you Miriam
replied Mrs Morel coolly
But Paul insisted on everybodys accepting his friendship with the girl and Mrs Morel was too wise to have any open rupture
It was not till he was twenty years old that the family could ever afford to go away for a holiday
Mrs Morel had never been away for a holiday except to see her sister since she had been married
Now at last Paul had saved enough money and they were all going
There was to be a party some of Annies friends one friend of Pauls a young man in the same office where William had previously been and Miriam
It was great excitement writing for rooms
Paul and his mother debated it endlessly between them
They wanted a furnished cottage for two weeks
She thought one week would be enough but he insisted on two
At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe a cottage such as they wished for thirty shillings a week
There was immense jubilation
Paul was wild with joy for his mothers sake
She would have a real holiday now
He and she sat at evening picturing what it would be like
Annie came in and Leonard and Alice and Kitty
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation
Paul told Miriam
She seemed to brood with joy over it
But the Morels house rang with excitement
They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train
Paul suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house because it was so far for her to walk
She came down for supper
Everybody was so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth
But almost as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and tight
He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned Mablethorpe and so he must read it to Miriam
He would never have got so far in the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry to his own family
But now they condescended to listen
Miriam sat on the sofa absorbed in him
She always seemed absorbed in him and by him when he was present
Mrs Morel sat jealously in her own chair
She was going to hear also
And even Annie and the father attended Morel with his head cocked on one side like somebody listening to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact
Paul ducked his head over the book
He had got now all the audience he cared for
And Mrs Morel and Annie almost contested with Miriam who should listen best and win his favour
He was in very high feather
But interrupted Mrs Morel what IS the Bride of Enderby that the bells are supposed to ring
Its an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning against water
I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a flood he replied
He had not the faintest knowledge what it really was but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that to his womenfolk
They listened and believed him
He believed himself
And the people knew what that tune meant
said his mother
Yesjust like the Scotch when they heard The Flowers o the Forestand when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm
How
said Annie
A bell sounds the same whether its rung backwards or forwards
But he said if you start with the deep bell and ring up to the high onederderderderderderderder
He ran up the scale
Everybody thought it clever
He thought so too
Then waiting a minute he continued the poem
Hm
said Mrs Morel curiously when he finished
But I wish everything thats written werent so sad
I canna see what they want drownin theirselves for said Morel
There was a pause
Annie got up to clear the table
Miriam rose to help with the pots
Let ME help to wash up she said
Certainly not cried Annie
You sit down again
There arent many
And Miriam who could not be familiar and insist sat down again to look at the book with Paul
He was master of the party his father was no good
And great tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby instead of at Mablethorpe
And he wasnt equal to getting a carriage
His bold little mother did that
Here
she cried to a man
Here
Paul and Annie got behind the rest convulsed with shamed laughter
How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage
said Mrs Morel
Two shillings
Why how far is it
A good way
I dont believe it she said
But she scrambled in
There were eight crowded in one old seaside carriage
You see said Mrs Morel its only threepence each and if it were a tramcar They drove along
Each cottage they came to Mrs Morel cried Is it this
Now this is it
Everybody sat breathless
They drove past
There was a universal sigh
Im thankful it wasnt that brute said Mrs Morel
I WAS frightened
They drove on and on
At last they descended at a house that stood alone over the dyke by the highroad
There was wild excitement because they had to cross a little bridge to get into the front garden
But they loved the house that lay so solitary with a seameadow on one side and immense expanse of land patched in white barley yellow oats red wheat and green rootcrops flat and stretching level to the sky
Paul kept accounts
He and his mother ran the show
The total expenseslodging food everythingwas sixteen shillings a week per person
He and Leonard went bathing in the mornings
Morel was wandering abroad quite early
You Paul his mother called from the bedroom eat a piece of breadandbutter
All right he answered
And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at the breakfasttable
The woman of the house was young
Her husband was blind and she did laundry work
So Mrs Morel always washed the pots in the kitchen and made the beds
But you said youd have a real holiday said Paul and now you work
Work
she exclaimed
What are you talking about
He loved to go with her across the fields to the village and the sea
She was afraid of the plank bridge and he abused her for being a baby
On the whole he stuck to her as if he were HER man
Miriam did not get much of him except perhaps when all the others went to the Coons
Coons were insufferably stupid to Miriam so he thought they were to himself also and he preached priggishly to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them
Yet he too knew all their songs and sang them along the roads roisterously
And if he found himself listening the stupidity pleased him very much
Yet to Annie he said Such rot
there isnt a grain of intelligence in it
Nobody with more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen
And to Miriam he said with much scorn of Annie and the others I suppose theyre at the Coons
It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs
She had a straight chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip to the turn
She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel when she sang even when it was Come down lovers lane For a walk with me talk with me
Only when he sketched or at evening when the others were at the Coons she had him to herself
He talked to her endlessly about his love of horizontals how they the great levels of sky and land in Lincolnshire meant to him the eternality of the will just as the bowed Norman arches of the church repeating themselves meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul on and on nobody knows where in contradiction to the perpendicular lines and to the Gothic arch which he said leapt up at heaven and touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine
Himself he said was Norman Miriam was Gothic
She bowed in consent even to that
One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore of sand towards Theddlethorpe
The long breakers plunged and ran in a hiss of foam along the coast
It was a warm evening
There was not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand no noise but the sound of the sea
Paul loved to see it clanging at the land
He loved to feel himself between the noise of it and the silence of the sandy shore
Miriam was with him
Everything grew very intense
It was quite dark when they turned again
The way home was through a gap in the sandhills and then along a raised grass road between two dykes
The country was black and still
From behind the sandhills came the whisper of the sea
Paul and Miriam walked in silence
Suddenly he started
The whole of his blood seemed to burst into flame and he could scarcely breathe
An enormous orange moon was staring at them from the rim of the sandhills
He stood still looking at it
Ah
cried Miriam when she saw it
He remained perfectly still staring at the immense and ruddy moon the only thing in the farreaching darkness of the level
His heart beat heavily the muscles of his arms contracted
What is it
murmured Miriam waiting for him
He turned and looked at her
She stood beside him for ever in shadow
Her face covered with the darkness of her hat was watching him unseen
But she was brooding
She was slightly afraiddeeply moved and religious
That was her best state
He was impotent against it
His blood was concentrated like a flame in his chest
But he could not get across to her
There were flashes in his blood
But somehow she ignored them
She was expecting some religious state in him
Still yearning she was half aware of his passion and gazed at him troubled
What is it
she murmured again
Its the moon he answered frowning
Yes she assented
Isnt it wonderful
She was curious about him
The crisis was past
He did not know himself what was the matter
He was naturally so young and their intimacy was so abstract he did not know he wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there
He was afraid of her
The fact that he might want her as a man wants a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame
When she shrank in her convulsed coiled torture from the thought of such a thing he had winced to the depths of his soul
And now this purity prevented even their first lovekiss
It was as if she could scarcely stand the shock of physical love even a passionate kiss and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it
As they walked along the dark fenmeadow he watched the moon and did not speak
She plodded beside him
He hated her for she seemed in some way to make him despise himself
Looking aheadhe saw the one light in the darkness the window of their lamplit cottage
He loved to think of his mother and the other jolly people
Well everybody else has been in long ago
said his mother as they entered
What does that matter
he cried irritably
I can go a walk if I like cant I
And I should have thought you could get in to supper with the rest said Mrs Morel
I shall please myself he retorted
Its not LATE
I shall do as I like
Very well said his mother cuttingly then DO as you like
And she took no further notice of him that evening
Which he pretended neither to notice nor to care about but sat reading
Miriam read also obliterating herself
Mrs Morel hated her for making her son like this
She watched Paul growing irritable priggish and melancholic
For this she put the blame on Miriam
Annie and all her friends joined against the girl
Miriam had no friend of her own only Paul
But she did not suffer so much because she despised the triviality of these other people
And Paul hated her because somehow she spoilt his ease and naturalness
And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation
CHAPTER VIII STRIFE IN LOVE ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship and got a job on the electrical plant at Minton Pit
He earned very little but had a good chance of getting on
But he was wild and restless
He did not drink nor gamble
Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes always through some hotheaded thoughtlessness
Either he went rabbiting in the woods like a poacher or he stayed in Nottingham all night instead of coming home or he miscalculated his dive into the canal at Bestwood and scored his chest into one mass of wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom
He had not been at his work many months when again he did not come home one night
Do you know where Arthur is
asked Paul at breakfast
I do not replied his mother
He is a fool said Paul
And if he DID anything I shouldnt mind
But no he simply cant come away from a game of whist or else he must see a girl home from the skatingrinkquite proprietouslyand so cant get home
Hes a fool
I dont know that it would make it any better if he did something to make us all ashamed said Mrs Morel
Well I should respect him more said Paul
I very much doubt it said his mother coldly
They went on with breakfast
Are you fearfully fond of him
Paul asked his mother
What do you ask that for
Because they say a woman always like the youngest best
She may dobut I dont
No he wearies me
And youd actually rather he was good
Id rather he showed some of a mans common sense
Paul was raw and irritable
He also wearied his mother very often
She saw the sunshine going out of him and she resented it
As they were finishing breakfast came the postman with a letter from Derby
Mrs Morel screwed up her eyes to look at the address
Give it here blind eye
exclaimed her son snatching it away from her
She started and almost boxed his ears
Its from your son Arthur he said
What now
cried Mrs Morel
My dearest Mother Paul read I dont know what made me such a fool
I want you to come and fetch me back from here
I came with Jack Bredon yesterday instead of going to work and enlisted
He said he was sick of wearing the seat of a stool out and like the idiot you know I am I came away with him
I have taken the Kings shilling but perhaps if you came for me they would let me go back with you
I was a fool when I did it
I dont want to be in the army
My dear mother I am nothing but a trouble to you
But if you get me out of this I promise I will have more sense and consideration



Mrs Morel sat down in her rockingchair
Well NOW she cried let him stop
Yes said Paul let him stop
There was silence
The mother sat with her hands folded in her apron her face set thinking
If Im not SICK
she cried suddenly
Sick
Now said Paul beginning to frown youre not going to worry your soul out about this do you hear
I suppose Im to take it as a blessing she flashed turning on her son
Youre not going to mount it up to a tragedy so there he retorted
The FOOLthe young fool
she cried
Hell look well in uniform said Paul irritatingly
His mother turned on him like a fury
Oh will he
she cried
Not in my eyes
He should get in a cavalry regiment hell have the time of his life and will look an awful swell
SwellSWELLa mighty swell idea indeeda common soldier
Well said Paul what am I but a common clerk
A good deal my boy
cried his mother stung
What
At any rate a MAN and not a thing in a red coat
I shouldnt mind being in a red coator dark blue that would suit me betterif they didnt boss me about too much
But his mother had ceased to listen
Just as he was getting on or might have been getting on at his joba young nuisancehere he goes and ruins himself for life
What good will he be do you think after THIS
It may lick him into shape beautifully said Paul
Lick him into shapelick what marrow there WAS out of his bones
A SOLDIERa common SOLDIERnothing but a body that makes movements when it hears a shout
Its a fine thing
I cant understand why it upsets you said Paul
No perhaps you cant
But I understand and she sat back in her chair her chin in one hand holding her elbow with the other brimmed up with wrath and chagrin
And shall you go to Derby
asked Paul
Yes
Its no good
Ill see for myself
And why on earth dont you let him stop
Its just what he wants
Of course cried the mother YOU know what he wants
She got ready and went by the first train to Derby where she saw her son and the sergeant
It was however no good
When Morel was having his dinner in the evening she said suddenly Ive had to go to Derby today
The miner turned up his eyes showing the whites in his black face
Has ter lass
What took thee there
That Arthur
Ohan whats agate now
Hes only enlisted
Morel put down his knife and leaned back in his chair
Nay he said that he niver as
And is going down to Aldershot tomorrow
Well
exclaimed the miner
Thats a winder
He considered it a moment said Hm
and proceeded with his dinner
Suddenly his face contracted with wrath
I hope he may never set foot i my house again he said
The idea
cried Mrs Morel
Saying such a thing
I do repeated Morel
A fool as runs away for a soldier let im look after issen I sll do no more for im
A fat sight you have done as it is she said
And Morel was almost ashamed to go to his publichouse that evening
Well did you go
said Paul to his mother when he came home
I did
And could you see him
Yes
And what did he say
He blubbered when I came away
Hm
And so did I so you neednt hm
Mrs Morel fretted after her son
She knew he would not like the army
He did not
The discipline was intolerable to him
But the doctor she said with some pride to Paul said he was perfectly proportionedalmost exactly all his measurements were correct
He IS goodlooking you know
Hes awfully nicelooking
But he doesnt fetch the girls like William does he
No its a different character
Hes a good deal like his father irresponsible
To console his mother Paul did not go much to Willey Farm at this time
And in the autumn exhibition of students work in the Castle he had two studies a landscape in watercolour and a still life in oil both of which had firstprize awards
He was highly excited
What do you think Ive got for my pictures mother
he asked coming home one evening
She saw by his eyes he was glad
Her face flushed
Now how should I know my boy
A first prize for those glass jars Hm
And a first prize for that sketch up at Willey Farm
Both first
Yes
Hm
There was a rosy bright look about her though she said nothing
Its nice he said isnt it
It is
Why dont you praise me up to the skies
She laughed
I should have the trouble of dragging you down again she said
But she was full of joy nevertheless
William had brought her his sporting trophies
She kept them still and she did not forgive his death
Arthur was handsomeat least a good specimenand warm and generous and probably would do well in the end
But Paul was going to distinguish himself
She had a great belief in him the more because he was unaware of his own powers
There was so much to come out of him
Life for her was rich with promise
She was to see herself fulfilled
Not for nothing had been her struggle
Several times during the exhibition Mrs Morel went to the Castle unknown to Paul
She wandered down the long room looking at the other exhibits
Yes they were good
But they had not in them a certain something which she demanded for her satisfaction
Some made her jealous they were so good
She looked at them a long time trying to find fault with them
Then suddenly she had a shock that made her heart beat
There hung Pauls picture
She knew it as if it were printed on her heart
NamePaul MorelFirst Prize
It looked so strange there in public on the walls of the Castle gallery where in her lifetime she had seen so many pictures
And she glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her again in front of the same sketch
But she felt a proud woman
When she met welldressed ladies going home to the Park she thought to herself Yes you look very wellbut I wonder if YOUR son has two first prizes in the Castle
And she walked on as proud a little woman as any in Nottingham
And Paul felt he had done something for her if only a trifle
All his work was hers
One day as he was going up Castle Gate he met Miriam
He had seen her on the Sunday and had not expected to meet her in town
She was walking with a rather striking woman blonde with a sullen expression and a defiant carriage
It was strange how Miriam in her bowed meditative bearing looked dwarfed beside this woman with the handsome shoulders
Miriam watched Paul searchingly
His gaze was on the stranger who ignored him
The girl saw his masculine spirit rear its head
Hello
he said you didnt tell me you were coming to town
No replied Miriam half apologetically
I drove in to Cattle Market with father
He looked at her companion
Ive told you about Mrs Dawes said Miriam huskily she was nervous
Clara do you know Paul
I think Ive seen him before replied Mrs Dawes indifferently as she shook hands with him
She had scornful grey eyes a skin like white honey and a full mouth with a slightly lifted upper lip that did not know whether it was raised in scorn of all men or out of eagerness to be kissed but which believed the former
She carried her head back as if she had drawn away in contempt perhaps from men also
She wore a large dowdy hat of black beaver and a sort of slightly affected simple dress that made her look rather sacklike
She was evidently poor and had not much taste
Miriam usually looked nice
Where have you seen me
Paul asked of the woman
She looked at him as if she would not trouble to answer
Then Walking with Louie Travers she said
Louie was one of the Spiral girls
Why do you know her
he asked
She did not answer
He turned to Miriam
Where are you going
he asked
To the Castle
What train are you going home by
I am driving with father
I wish you could come too
What time are you free
You know not till eight tonight damn it
And directly the two women moved on
Paul remembered that Clara Dawes was the daughter of an old friend of Mrs Leivers
Miriam had sought her out because she had once been Spiral overseer at Jordans and because her husband Baxter Dawes was smith for the factory making the irons for cripple instruments and so on
Through her Miriam felt she got into direct contact with Jordans and could estimate better Pauls position
But Mrs Dawes was separated from her husband and had taken up Womens Rights
She was supposed to be clever
It interested Paul
Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked
The smith was a man of thirtyone or thirtytwo
He came occasionally through Pauls cornera big wellset man also striking to look at and handsome
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife
He had the same white skin with a clear golden tinge
His hair was of soft brown his moustache was golden
And he had a similar defiance in his bearing and manner
But then came the difference
His eyes dark brown and quickshifting were dissolute
They protruded very slightly and his eyelids hung over them in a way that was half hate
His mouth too was sensual
His whole manner was of cowed defiance as if he were ready to knock anybody down who disapproved of himperhaps because he really disapproved of himself
From the first day he had hated Paul
Finding the lads impersonal deliberate gaze of an artist on his face he got into a fury
What are yer lookin at
he sneered bullying
The boy glanced away
But the smith used to stand behind the counter and talk to Mr Pappleworth
His speech was dirty with a kind of rottenness
Again he found the youth with his cool critical gaze fixed on his face
The smith started round as if he had been stung
Whatr yer lookin at three haporth o pap
he snarled
The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly
Why yer
shouted Dawes
Leave him alone said Mr Pappleworth in that insinuating voice which means Hes only one of your good little sops who cant help it
Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time he came through with the same curious criticism glancing away before he met the smiths eye
It made Dawes furious
They hated each other in silence
Clara Dawes had no children
When she had left her husband the home had been broken up and she had gone to live with her mother
Dawes lodged with his sister
In the same house was a sisterinlaw and somehow Paul knew that this girl Louie Travers was now Dawess woman
She was a handsome insolent hussy who mocked at the youth and yet flushed if he walked along to the station with her as she went home
The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening
She had a fire in the parlour and was waiting for him
The others except her father and mother and the young children had gone out so the two had the parlour together
It was a long low warm room
There were three of Pauls small sketches on the wall and his photo was on the mantelpiece
On the table and on the high old rosewood piano were bowls of coloured leaves
He sat in the armchair she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet
The glow was warm on her handsome pensive face as she kneeled there like a devotee
What did you think of Mrs
Dawes
she asked quietly
She doesnt look very amiable he replied
No but dont you think shes a fine woman
she said in a deep tone Yesin stature
But without a grain of taste
I like her for some things
IS she disagreeable
I dont think so
I think shes dissatisfied
What with
Wellhow would you like to be tied for life to a man like that
Why did she marry him then if she was to have revulsions so soon
Ay why did she
repeated Miriam bitterly
And I should have thought she had enough fight in her to match him he said
Miriam bowed her head
Ay
she queried satirically
What makes you think so
Look at her mouthmade for passionand the very setback of her throat He threw his head back in Claras defiant manner
Miriam bowed a little lower
Yes she said
There was a silence for some moments while he thought of Clara
And what were the things you liked about her
she asked
I dont knowher skin and the texture of herand herI dont knowtheres a sort of fierceness somewhere in her
I appreciate her as an artist thats all
Yes
He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that strange way
It irritated him
You dont really like her do you
he asked the girl
She looked at him with her great dazzled dark eyes
I do she said
You dontyou cantnot really
Then what
she asked slowly
Eh I dont knowperhaps you like her because shes got a grudge against men
That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking Mrs Dawes but this did not occur to him
They were silent
There had come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming habitual with him particularly when he was with Miriam
She longed to smooth it away and she was afraid of it
It seemed the stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel
There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl
He reached over and pulled out a bunch
If you put red berries in your hair he said why would you look like some witch or priestess and never like a reveller
She laughed with a naked painful sound
I dont know she said
His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the berries
Why cant you laugh
he said
You never laugh laughter
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous and then it almost seems to hurt you
She bowed her head as if he were scolding her
I wish you could laugh at me just for one minutejust for one minute
I feel as if it would set something free
Butand she looked up at him with eyes frightened and strugglingI do laugh at youI DO
Never
Theres always a kind of intensity
When you laugh I could always cry it seems as if it shows up your suffering
Oh you make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate
Slowly she shook her head despairingly
Im sure I dont want to she said
Im so damned spiritual with YOU always
he cried
She remained silent thinking Then why dont you be otherwise
But he saw her crouching brooding figure and it seemed to tear him in two
But there its autumn he said and everybody feels like a disembodied spirit then
There was still another silence
This peculiar sadness between them thrilled her soul
He seemed so beautiful with his eyes gone dark and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well
You make me so spiritual
he lamented
And I dont want to be spiritual
She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop and looked up at him almost challenging
But still her soul was naked in her great dark eyes and there was the same yearning appeal upon her
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done so
But he could not kiss her thusand she seemed to leave no other way
And she yearned to him
He gave a brief laugh
Well he said get that French and well do somesome Verlaine
Yes she said in a deep tone almost of resignation
And she rose and got the books
And her rather red nervous hands looked so pitiful he was mad to comfort her and kiss her
But then be dared notor could not
There was something prevented him
His kisses were wrong for her
They continued the reading till ten oclock when they went into the kitchen and Paul was natural and jolly again with the father and mother
His eyes were dark and shining there was a kind of fascination about him
When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front wheel punctured
Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl he said to her
I shall be late and then I sll catch it
He lighted the hurricane lamp took off his coat turned up the bicycle and set speedily to work
Miriam came with the bowl of water and stood close to him watching
She loved to see his hands doing things
He was slim and vigorous with a kind of easiness even in his most hasty movements
And busy at his work he seemed to forget her
She loved him absorbedly
She wanted to run her hands down his sides
She always wanted to embrace him so long as he did not want her
There
he said rising suddenly
Now could you have done it quicker
No
she laughed
He straightened himself
His back was towards her
She put her two hands on his sides and ran them quickly down
You are so FINE
she said
He laughed hating her voice but his blood roused to a wave of flame by her hands
She did not seem to realise HIM in all this
He might have been an object
She never realised the male he was
He lighted his bicyclelamp bounced the machine on the barn floor to see that the tyres were sound and buttoned his coat
Thats all right
he said
She was trying the brakes that she knew were broken
Did you have them mended
she asked
No
But why didnt you
The back one goes on a bit
But its not safe
I can use my toe
I wish youd had them mended she murmured
Dont worrycome to tea tomorrow with Edgar
Shall we
Doabout four
Ill come to meet you
Very well
She was pleased
They went across the dark yard to the gate
Looking across he saw through the uncurtained window of the kitchen the heads of Mr and Mrs Leivers in the warm glow
It looked very cosy
The road with pine trees was quite black in front
Till tomorrow he said jumping on his bicycle
Youll take care wont you
she pleaded
Yes
His voice already came out of the darkness
She stood a moment watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the ground
She turned very slowly indoors
Orion was wheeling up over the wood his dog twinkling after him half smothered
For the rest the world was full of darkness and silent save for the breathing of cattle in their stalls
She prayed earnestly for his safety that night
When he left her she often lay in anxiety wondering if he had got home safely
He dropped down the hills on his bicycle
The roads were greasy so he had to let it go
He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged over the second steeper drop in the hill
Here goes
he said
It was risky because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom and because of the brewers waggons with drunken waggoners asleep
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him and he loved it
Recklessness is almost a mans revenge on his woman
He feels he is not valued so he will risk destroying himself to deprive her altogether
The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers silver upon the blackness as he spun past
Then there was the long climb home
See mother
he said as he threw her the berries and leaves on to the table
Hm
she said glancing at them then away again
She sat reading alone as she always did
Arent they pretty
Yes
He knew she was cross with him
After a few minutes he said Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea tomorrow
She did not answer
You dont mind
Still she did not answer
Do you
he asked
You know whether I mind or not
I dont see why you should
I have plenty of meals there
You do
Then why do you begrudge them tea
I begrudge whom tea
What are you so horrid for
Oh say no more
Youve asked her to tea its quite sufficient
Shell come
He was very angry with his mother
He knew it was merely Miriam she objected to
He flung off his boots and went to bed
Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon
He was glad to see them coming
They arrived home at about four oclock
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon
Mrs Morel sat in her black dress and black apron
She rose to meet the visitors
With Edgar she was cordial but with Miriam cold and rather grudging
Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her brown cashmere frock
He helped his mother to get the tea ready
Miriam would have gladly proffered but was afraid
He was rather proud of his home
There was about it now he thought a certain distinction
The chairs were only wooden and the sofa was old
But the hearthrug and cushions were cosy the pictures were prints in good taste there was a simplicity in everything and plenty of books
He was never ashamed in the least of his home nor was Miriam of hers because both were what they should be and warm
And then he was proud of the table the china was pretty the cloth was fine
It did not matter that the spoons were not silver nor the knives ivoryhandled everything looked nice
Mrs Morel had managed wonderfully while her children were growing up so that nothing was out of place
Miriam talked books a little
That was her unfailing topic
But Mrs Morel was not cordial and turned soon to Edgar
At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs Morels pew
Morel never went to chapel preferring the publichouse
Mrs Morel like a little champion sat at the head of her pew Paul at the other end and at first Miriam sat next to him
Then the chapel was like home
It was a pretty place with dark pews and slim elegant pillars and flowers
And the same people had sat in the same places ever since he was a boy
It was wonderfully sweet and soothing to sit there for an hour and a half next to Miriam and near to his mother uniting his two loves under the spell of the place of worship
Then he felt warm and happy and religious at once
And after chapel he walked home with Miriam whilst Mrs Morel spent the rest of the evening with her old friend Mrs Burns
He was keenly alive on his walks on Sunday nights with Edgar and Miriam
He never went past the pits at night by the lighted lamphouse the tall black headstocks and lines of trucks past the fans spinning slowly like shadows without the feeling of Miriam returning to him keen and almost unbearable
She did not very long occupy the Morels pew
Her father took one for themselves once more
It was under the little gallery opposite the Morels
When Paul and his mother came in the chapel the Leiverss pew was always empty
He was anxious for fear she would not come it was so far and there were so many rainy Sundays
Then often very late indeed she came in with her long stride her head bowed her face hidden under her bat of dark green velvet
Her face as she sat opposite was always in shadow
But it gave him a very keen feeling as if all his soul stirred within him to see her there
It was not the same glow happiness and pride that he felt in having his mother in charge something more wonderful less human and tinged to intensity by a pain as if there were something he could not get to
At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed
He was twentyone and she was twenty
She was beginning to dread the spring he became so wild and hurt her so much
All the way he went cruelly smashing her beliefs
Edgar enjoyed it
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate
But Miriam suffered exquisite pain as with an intellect like a knife the man she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved and had her being
But he did not spare her
He was cruel
And when they went alone he was even more fierce as if he would kill her soul
He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness
She exultsshe exults as she carries him off from me Mrs Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone
Shes not like an ordinary woman who can leave me my share in him
She wants to absorb him
She wants to draw him out and absorb him till there is nothing left of him even for himself
He will never be a man on his own feetshe will suck him up
So the mother sat and battled and brooded bitterly
And he coming home from his walks with Miriam was wild with torture
He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists going at a great rate
Then brought up against a stile he stood for some minutes and did not move
There was a great hollow of darkness fronting him and on the black upslopes patches of tiny lights and in the lowest trough of the night a flare of the pit
It was all weird and dreadful
Why was he torn so almost bewildered and unable to move
Why did his mother sit at home and suffer
He knew she suffered badly
But why should she
And why did he hate Miriam and feel so cruel towards her at the thought of his mother
If Miriam caused his mother suffering then he hated herand he easily hated her
Why did she make him feel as if he were uncertain of himself insecure an indefinite thing as if he had not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the space breaking into him
How he hated her
And then what a rush of tenderness and humility
Suddenly he plunged on again running home
His mother saw on him the marks of some agony and she said nothing
But he had to make her talk to him
Then she was angry with him for going so far with Miriam
Why dont you like her mother
he cried in despair
I dont know my boy she replied piteously
Im sure Ive tried to like her
Ive tried and tried but I cantI cant
And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two
Spring was the worst time
He was changeable and intense and cruel
So he decided to stay away from her
Then came the hours when he knew Miriam was expecting him
His mother watched him growing restless
He could not go on with his work
He could do nothing
It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards Willey Farm
Then he put on his hat and went saying nothing
And his mother knew he was gone
And as soon as he was on the way he sighed with relief
And when he was with her he was cruel again
One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere with Miriam sitting beside him
It was a glistening whiteandblue day
Big clouds so brilliant went by overhead while shadows stole along on the water
The clear spaces in the sky were of clean cold blue
Paul lay on his back in the old grass looking up
He could not bear to look at Miriam
She seemed to want him and he resisted
He resisted all the time
He wanted now to give her passion and tenderness and he could not
He felt that she wanted the soul out of his body and not him
All his strength and energy she drew into herself through some channel which united them
She did not want to meet him so that there were two of them man and woman together
She wanted to draw all of him into her
It urged him to an intensity like madness which fascinated him as drugtaking might
He was discussing Michael Angelo
It felt to her as if she were fingering the very quivering tissue the very protoplasm of life as she heard him
It gave her deepest satisfaction
And in the end it frightened her
There he lay in the white intensity of his search and his voice gradually filled her with fear so level it was almost inhuman as if in a trance
Dont talk any more she pleaded softly laying her hand on his forehead
He lay quite still almost unable to move
His body was somewhere discarded
Why not
Are you tired
Yes and it wears you out
He laughed shortly realising
Yet you always make me like it he said
I dont wish to she said very low
Not when youve gone too far and you feel you cant bear it
But your unconscious self always asks it of me
And I suppose I want it
He went on in his dead fashion If only you could want ME and not want what I can reel off for you 
I
she cried bitterlyI
Why when would you let me take you
Then its my fault he said and gathering himself together he got up and began to talk trivialities
He felt insubstantial
In a vague way he hated her for it
And he knew he was as much to blame himself
This however did not prevent his hating her
One evening about this time he had walked along the home road with her
They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood unable to part
As the stars came out the clouds closed
They had glimpses of their own constellation Orion towards the west
His jewels glimmered for a moment his dog ran low struggling with difficulty through the spume of cloud
Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations
They had gazed at him in their strange surcharged hours of feeling until they seemed themselves to live in every one of his stars
This evening Paul had been moody and perverse
Orion had seemed just an ordinary constellation to him
He had fought against his glamour and fascination
Miriam was watching her lovers mood carefully
But he said nothing that gave him away till the moment came to part when he stood frowning gloomily at the gathered clouds behind which the great constellation must be striding still
There was to be a little party at his house the next day at which she was to attend
I shant come and meet you he said
Oh very well its not very nice out she replied slowly
Its not thatonly they dont like me to
They say I care more for you than for them
And you understand dont you
You know its only friendship
Miriam was astonished and hurt for him
It had cost him an effort
She left him wanting to spare him any further humiliation
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road
She was hurt deep down and she despised him for being blown about by any wind of authority
And in her heart of hearts unconsciously she felt that he was trying to get away from her
This she would never have acknowledged
She pitied him
At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordans warehouse
Mr Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own and Paul remained with Mr Jordan as Spiral overseer
His wages were to be raised to thirty shillings at the yearend if things went well
Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French lesson
Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm and she grieved at the thought of her educations coming to end moreover they both loved to be together in spite of discords
So they read Balzac and did compositions and felt highly cultured
Friday night was reckoning night for the miners
Morel reckonedshared up the money of the stalleither in the New Inn at Bretty or in his own house according as his fellowbutties wished
Barker had turned a nondrinker so now the men reckoned at Morels house
Annie who had been teaching away was at home again
She was still a tomboy and she was engaged to be married
Paul was studying design
Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening unless the weeks earnings were small
He bustled immediately after his dinner prepared to get washed
It was decorum for the women to absent themselves while the men reckoned
Women were not supposed to spy into such a masculine privacy as the butties reckoning nor were they to know the exact amount of the weeks earnings
So whilst her father was spluttering in the scullery Annie went out to spend an hour with a neighbour
Mrs Morel attended to her baking
Shut that dooer
bawled Morel furiously
Annie banged it behind her and was gone
If tha oppens it again while Im weshin me Ill mae thy jaw rattle he threatened from the midst of his soapsuds
Paul and the mother frowned to hear him
Presently he came running out of the scullery with the soapy water dripping from him dithering with cold
Oh my sirs
he said
Wheers my towel
It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire otherwise he would have bullied and blustered
He squatted on his heels before the hot bakingfire to dry himself
Ffff
he went pretending to shudder with cold
Goodness man dont be such a kid
said Mrs Morel
Its NOT cold
Thee strip thysen stark nakd to wesh thy flesh i that scullery said the miner as he rubbed his hair nowt br a iceouse
And I shouldnt make that fuss replied his wife
No thad drop down stiff as dead as a doorknob wi thy nesh sides
Why is a doorknob deader than anything else
asked Paul curious
Eh I dunno thats what they say replied his father
But theres that much draught i yon scullery as it blows through your ribs like through a fivebarred gate
It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours said Mrs Morel
Morel looked down ruefully at his sides
Me
he exclaimed
Im nowt br a skinned rabbit
My bones fair juts out on me
I should like to know where retorted his wife
Ivrywheer
Im nobbut a sack o faggots
Mrs Morel laughed
He had still a wonderfully young body muscular without any fat
His skin was smooth and clear
It might have been the body of a man of twentyeight except that there were perhaps too many blue scars like tattoomarks where the coaldust remained under the skin and that his chest was too hairy
But he put his hand on his side ruefully
It was his fixed belief that because be did not get fat he was as thin as a starved rat
Paul looked at his fathers thick brownish hands all scarred with broken nails rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides and the incongruity struck him
It seemed strange they were the same flesh
I suppose he said to his father you had a good figure once
Eh
exclaimed the miner glancing round startled and timid like a child
He had exclaimed Mrs Morel if he didnt hurtle himself up as if he was trying to get in the smallest space he could
Me
exclaimed Morelme a good figure
I wor niver much more nr a skeleton
Man
cried his wife dont be such a pulamiter
Strewth
he said
Thas niver knowed me but what I looked as if I wor goin off in a rapid decline
She sat and laughed
Youve had a constitution like iron she said and never a man had a better start if it was body that counted
You should have seen him as a young man she cried suddenly to Paul drawing herself up to imitate her husbands once handsome bearing
Morel watched her shyly
He saw again the passion she had had for him
It blazed upon her for a moment
He was shy rather scared and humble
Yet again he felt his old glow
And then immediately he felt the ruin he had made during these years
He wanted to bustle about to run away from it
Gie my back a bit of a wesh he asked her
His wife brought a wellsoaped flannel and clapped it on his shoulders
He gave a jump
Eh tha mucky little ussy
he cried
Cowd as death
You ought to have been a salamander she laughed washing his back
It was very rarely she would do anything so personal for him
The children did those things
The next world wont be half hot enough for you she added
No he said thalt see as its draughty for me
But she had finished
She wiped him in a desultory fashion and went upstairs returning immediately with his shiftingtrousers
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt
Then ruddy and shiny with hair on end and his flannelette shirt hanging over his pittrousers he stood warming the garments he was going to put on
He turned them he pulled them inside out he scorched them
Goodness man
cried Mrs Morel get dressed
Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd as a tub o water
he said
At last he took off his pittrousers and donned decent black
He did all this on the hearthrug as he would have done if Annie and her familiar friends had been present
Mrs Morel turned the bread in the oven
Then from the red earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a corner she took another handful of paste worked it to the proper shape and dropped it into a tin
As she was doing so Barker knocked and entered
He was a quiet compact little man who looked as if he would go through a stone wall
His black hair was cropped short his head was bony
Like most miners he was pale but healthy and taut
Evenin missis he nodded to Mrs Morel and he seated himself with a sigh
Goodevening she replied cordially
Thas made thy heels crack said Morel
I dunno as I have said Barker
He sat as the men always did in Morels kitchen effacing himself rather
Hows missis
she asked of him
He had told her some time back Were expectin us third just now you see
Well he answered rubbing his head she keeps pretty middlin I think
Lets seewhen
asked Mrs Morel
Well I shouldnt be surprised any time now
Ah
And shes kept fairly
Yes tidy
Thats a blessing for shes none too strong
No
An Ive done another silly trick
Whats that
Mrs Morel knew Barker wouldnt do anything very silly
Im come beout th marketbag
You can have mine
Nay youll be wantin that yourself
I shant
I take a string bag always
She saw the determined little collier buying in the weeks groceries and meat on the Friday nights and she admired him
Barkers little but hes ten times the man you are she said to her husband
Just then Wesson entered
He was thin rather fraillooking with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile despite his seven children
But his wife was a passionate woman
I see youve kested me he said smiling rather vapidly
Yes replied Barker
The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler
His nose was pointed and red
Im afraid youre cold Mr Wesson said Mrs Morel
Its a bit nippy he replied
Then come to the fire
Nay I sll do where I am
Both colliers sat away back
They could not be induced to come on to the hearth
The hearth is sacred to the family
Go thy ways i th armchair cried Morel cheerily
Nay thank yer Im very nicely here
Yes come of course insisted Mrs Morel
He rose and went awkwardly
He sat in Morels armchair awkwardly
It was too great a familiarity
But the fire made him blissfully happy
And hows that chest of yours
demanded Mrs Morel
He smiled again with his blue eyes rather sunny
Oh its very middlin he said
Wi a rattle in it like a kettledrum said Barker shortly
Tttt
went Mrs Morel rapidly with her tongue
Did you have that flannel singlet made
Not yet he smiled
Then why didnt you
she cried
Itll come he smiled
Ah an Doomsday
exclaimed Barker
Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson
But then they were both as hard as nails physically
When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to Paul
Count it boy he asked humbly
Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil tipped the bag upside down on the table
There was a fivepound bag of silver sovereigns and loose money
He counted quickly referred to the checksthe written papers giving amount of coalput the money in order
Then Barker glanced at the checks
Mrs Morel went upstairs and the three men came to table
Morel as master of the house sat in his armchair with his back to the hot fire
The two butties had cooler seats
None of them counted the money
What did we say Simpsons was
asked Morel and the butties cavilled for a minute over the daymans earnings
Then the amount was put aside
An Bill Naylors
This money also was taken from the pack
Then because Wesson lived in one of the companys houses and his rent had been deducted Morel and Barker took fourandsix each
And because Morels coals had come and the leading was stopped Barker and Wesson took four shillings each
Then it was plain sailing
Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were no more sovereigns each half a crown till there were no more halfcrowns each a shilling till there were no more shillings
If there was anything at the end that wouldnt split Morel took it and stood drinks
Then the three men rose and went
Morel scuttled out of the house before his wife came down
She heard the door close and descended
She looked hastily at the bread in the oven
Then glancing on the table she saw her money lying
Paul had been working all the time
But now he felt his mother counting the weeks money and her wrath rising Ttttt
went her tongue
He frowned
He could not work when she was cross
She counted again
A measly twentyfive shillings
she exclaimed
How much was the cheque
Ten pounds eleven said Paul irritably
He dreaded what was coming
And he gives me a scrattlin twentyfive an his club this week
But I know him
He thinks because YOURE earning he neednt keep the house any longer
No all he has to do with his money is to guttle it
But Ill show him
Oh mother dont
cried Paul
Dont what I should like to know
she exclaimed
Dont carry on again
I cant work
She went very quiet
Yes its all very well she said but how do you think Im going to manage
Well it wont make it any better to whittle about it
I should like to know what youd do if you had it to put up with
It wont be long
You can have my money
Let him go to hell
He went back to his work and she tied her bonnetstrings grimly
When she was fretted he could not bear it
But now he began to insist on her recognizing him
The two loaves at the top she said will be done in twenty minutes
Dont forget them
All right he answered and she went to market
He remained alone working
But his usual intense concentration became unsettled
He listened for the yardgate
At a quarterpast seven came a low knock and Miriam entered
All alone
she said
Yes
As if at home she took off her tamoshanter and her long coat hanging them up
It gave him a thrill
This might be their own house his and hers
Then she came back and peered over his work
What is it
she asked
Still design for decorating stuffs and for embroidery
She bent shortsightedly over the drawings
It irritated him that she peered so into everything that was his searching him out
He went into the parlour and returned with a bundle of brownish linen
Carefully unfolding it he spread it on the floor
It proved to be a curtain or portiere beautifully stencilled with a design on roses
Ah how beautiful
she cried
The spread cloth with its wonderful reddish roses and dark green stems all so simple and somehow so wickedlooking lay at her feet
She went on her knees before it her dark curls dropping
He saw her crouched voluptuously before his work and his heart beat quickly
Suddenly she looked up at him
Why does it seem cruel
she asked
What
There seems a feeling of cruelty about it she said
Its jolly good whether or not he replied folding up his work with a lovers hands
She rose slowly pondering
And what will you do with it
she asked
Send it to Libertys
I did it for my mother but I think shed rather have the money
Yes said Miriam
He had spoken with a touch of bitterness and Miriam sympathised
Money would have been nothing to HER
He took the cloth back into the parlour
When he returned he threw to Miriam a smaller piece
It was a cushioncover with the same design
I did that for you he said
She fingered the work with trembling hands and did not speak
He became embarrassed
By Jove the bread
he cried
He took the top loaves out tapped them vigorously
They were done
He put them on the hearth to cool
Then he went to the scullery wetted his hands scooped the last white dough out of the punchion and dropped it in a bakingtin
Miriam was still bent over her painted cloth
He stood rubbing the bits of dough from his hands
You do like it
he asked
She looked up at him with her dark eyes one flame of love
He laughed uncomfortably
Then he began to talk about the design
There was for him the most intense pleasure in talking about his work to Miriam
All his passion all his wild blood went into this intercourse with her when he talked and conceived his work
She brought forth to him his imaginations
She did not understand any more than a woman understands when she conceives a child in her womb
But this was life for her and for him
While they were talking a young woman of about twentytwo small and pale holloweyed yet with a relentless look about her entered the room
She was a friend at the Morels
Take your things off said Paul
No Im not stopping
She sat down in the armchair opposite Paul and Miriam who were on the sofa
Miriam moved a little farther from him
The room was hot with a scent of new bread
Brown crisp loaves stood on the hearth
I shouldnt have expected to see you here tonight Miriam Leivers said Beatrice wickedly
Why not
murmured Miriam huskily
Why lets look at your shoes
Miriam remained uncomfortably still
If tha doesna tha dursna laughed Beatrice
Miriam put her feet from under her dress
Her boots had that queer irresolute rather pathetic look about them which showed how selfconscious and selfmistrustful she was
And they were covered with mud
Glory
Youre a positive muckheap exclaimed Beatrice
Who cleans your boots
I clean them myself
Then you wanted a job said Beatrice
It would ha taken a lot of men to ha brought me down here tonight
But love laughs at sludge doesnt it Postle my duck
Inter alia he said
Oh Lord
are you going to spout foreign languages
What does it mean Miriam
There was a fine sarcasm in the last question but Miriam did not see it
Among other things I believe she said humbly
Beatrice put her tongue between her teeth and laughed wickedly
Among other things Postle
she repeated
Do you mean love laughs at mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers and men friends and lady friends and even at the bloved himself
She affected a great innocence
In fact its one big smile he replied
Up its sleeve Postle Morelyou believe me she said and she went off into another burst of wicked silent laughter
Miriam sat silent withdrawn into herself
Every one of Pauls friends delighted in taking sides against her and he left her in the lurchseemed almost to have a sort of revenge upon her then
Are you still at school
asked Miriam of Beatrice
Yes
Youve not had your notice then
I expect it at Easter
Isnt it an awful shame to turn you off merely because you didnt pass the exam
I dont know said Beatrice coldly
Agatha says youre as good as any teacher anywhere
It seems to me ridiculous
I wonder why you didnt pass
Short of brains eh Postle
said Beatrice briefly
Only brains to bite with replied Paul laughing
Nuisance
she cried and springing from her seat she rushed and boxed his ears
She had beautiful small hands
He held her wrists while she wrestled with him
At last she broke free and seized two handfuls of his thick dark brown hair which she shook
Beat
he said as he pulled his hair straight with his fingers
I hate you
She laughed with glee
Mind
she said
I want to sit next to you
Id as lief be neighbours with a vixen he said nevertheless making place for her between him and Miriam
Did it ruffle his pretty hair then
she cried and with her haircomb she combed him straight
And his nice little moustache
she exclaimed
She tilted his head back and combed his young moustache
Its a wicked moustache Postle she said
Its a red for danger
Have you got any of those cigarettes
He pulled his cigarettecase from his pocket
Beatrice looked inside it
And fancy me having Connies last cig said Beatrice putting the thing between her teeth
He held a lit match to her and she puffed daintily
Thanks so much darling she said mockingly
It gave her a wicked delight
Dont you think he does it nicely Miriam
she asked
Oh very
said Miriam
He took a cigarette for himself
Light old boy
said Beatrice tilting her cigarette at him
He bent forward to her to light his cigarette at hers
She was winking at him as he did so
Miriam saw his eyes trembling with mischief and his full almost sensual mouth quivering
He was not himself and she could not bear it
As he was now she had no connection with him she might as well not have existed
She saw the cigarette dancing on his full red lips
She hated his thick hair for being tumbled loose on his forehead
Sweet boy
said Beatrice tipping up his chin and giving him a little kiss on the cheek
I sll kiss thee back Beat he said
Tha wunna
she giggled jumping up and going away
Isnt he shameless Miriam
Quite said Miriam
By the way arent you forgetting the bread
By Jove
he cried flinging open the oven door
Out puffed the bluish smoke and a smell of burned bread
Oh golly
cried Beatrice coming to his side
He crouched before the oven she peered over his shoulder
This is what comes of the oblivion of love my boy
Paul was ruefully removing the loaves
One was burnt black on the hot side another was hard as a brick
Poor mater
said Paul
You want to grate it said Beatrice
Fetch me the nutmeggrater
She arranged the bread in the oven
He brought the grater and she grated the bread on to a newspaper on the table
He set the doors open to blow away the smell of burned bread
Beatrice grated away puffing her cigarette knocking the charcoal off the poor loaf
My word Miriam
youre in for it this time said Beatrice
I
exclaimed Miriam in amazement
Youd better be gone when his mother comes in
I know why King Alfred burned the cakes
Now I see it
Postle would fix up a tale about his work making him forget if he thought it would wash
If that old woman had come in a bit sooner shed have boxed the brazen things ears who made the oblivion instead of poor Alfreds
She giggled as she scraped the loaf
Even Miriam laughed in spite of herself
Paul mended the fire ruefully
The garden gate was heard to bang
Quick
cried Beatrice giving Paul the scraped loaf
Wrap it up in a damp towel
Paul disappeared into the scullery
Beatrice hastily blew her scrapings into the fire and sat down innocently
Annie came bursting in
She was an abrupt quite smart young woman
She blinked in the strong light
Smell of burning
she exclaimed
Its the cigarettes replied Beatrice demurely
Wheres Paul
Leonard had followed Annie
He had a long comic face and blue eyes very sad
I suppose hes left you to settle it between you he said
He nodded sympathetically to Miriam and became gently sarcastic to Beatrice
No said Beatrice hes gone off with number nine
I just met number five inquiring for him said Leonard
Yeswere going to share him up like Solomons baby said Beatrice
Annie laughed
Oh ay said Leonard
And which bit should you have
I dont know said Beatrice
Ill let all the others pick first
An youd have the leavings like
said Leonard twisting up a comic face
Annie was looking in the oven
Miriam sat ignored
Paul entered
This breads a fine sight our Paul said Annie
Then you should stop an look after it said Paul
You mean YOU should do what youre reckoning to do replied Annie
He should shouldnt he
cried Beatrice
I sd think hed got plenty on hand said Leonard
You had a nasty walk didnt you Miriam
said Annie
Yesbut Id been in all week And you wanted a bit of a change like insinuated Leonard kindly
Well you cant be stuck in the house for ever Annie agreed
She was quite amiable
Beatrice pulled on her coat and went out with Leonard and Annie
She would meet her own boy
Dont forget that bread our Paul cried Annie
Goodnight Miriam
I dont think it will rain
When they had all gone Paul fetched the swathed loaf unwrapped it and surveyed it sadly
Its a mess
he said
But answered Miriam impatiently what is it after alltwopence hapenny
Yes butits the maters precious baking and shell take it to heart
However its no good bothering
He took the loaf back into the scullery
There was a little distance between him and Miriam
He stood balanced opposite her for some moments considering thinking of his behaviour with Beatrice
He felt guilty inside himself and yet glad
For some inscrutable reason it served Miriam right
He was not going to repent
She wondered what he was thinking of as he stood suspended
His thick hair was tumbled over his forehead
Why might she not push it back for him and remove the marks of Beatrices comb
Why might she not press his body with her two hands
It looked so firm and every whit living
And he would let other girls why not her
Suddenly he started into life
It made her quiver almost with terror as he quickly pushed the hair off his forehead and came towards her
Halfpast eight
he said
Wed better buck up
Wheres your French
Miriam shyly and rather bitterly produced her exercisebook
Every week she wrote for him a sort of diary of her inner life in her own French
He had found this was the only way to get her to do compositions
And her diary was mostly a loveletter
He would read it now she felt as if her souls history were going to be desecrated by him in his present mood
He sat beside her
She watched his hand firm and warm rigorously scoring her work
He was reading only the French ignoring her soul that was there
But gradually his hand forgot its work
He read in silence motionless
She quivered
Ce matin les oiseaux mont eveille he read
Il faisait encore un crepuscule
Mais la petite fenetre de ma chambre etait bleme et puis jaune et tous les oiseaux du bois eclaterent dans un chanson vif et resonnant
Toute laube tressaillit
Javais reve de vous
Estce que vous voyez aussi laube
Les oiseaux meveillent presque tous les matins et toujours il y a quelque chose de terreur dans le cri des grives
Il est si clair Miriam sat tremulous half ashamed
He remained quite still trying to understand
He only knew she loved him
He was afraid of her love for him
It was too good for him and he was inadequate
His own love was at fault not hers
Ashamed he corrected her work humbly writing above her words
Look he said quietly the past participle conjugated with avoir agrees with the direct object when it precedes
She bent forward trying to see and to understand
Her free fine curls tickled his face
He started as if they had been red hot shuddering
He saw her peering forward at the page her red lips parted piteously the black hair springing in fine strands across her tawny ruddy cheek
She was coloured like a pomegranate for richness
His breath came short as he watched her
Suddenly she looked up at him
Her dark eyes were naked with their love afraid and yearning
His eyes too were dark and they hurt her
They seemed to master her
She lost all her selfcontrol was exposed in fear
And he knew before he could kiss her he must drive something out of himself
And a touch of hate for her crept back again into his heart
He returned to her exercise
Suddenly he flung down the pencil and was at the oven in a leap turning the bread
For Miriam he was too quick
She started violently and it hurt her with real pain
Even the way he crouched before the oven hurt her
There seemed to be something cruel in it something cruel in the swift way he pitched the bread out of the tins caught it up again
If only he had been gentle in his movements she would have felt so rich and warm
As it was she was hurt
He returned and finished the exercise
Youve done well this week he said
She saw he was flattered by her diary
It did not repay her entirely
You really do blossom out sometimes he said
You ought to write poetry
She lifted her head with joy then she shook it mistrustfully
I dont trust myself she said
You should try
Again she shook her head
Shall we read or is it too late
he asked
It is latebut we can read just a little she pleaded
She was really getting now the food for her life during the next week
He made her copy Baudelaires Le Balcon
Then he read it for her
His voice was soft and caressing but growing almost brutal
He had a way of lifting his lips and showing his teeth passionately and bitterly when he was much moved
This he did now
It made Miriam feel as if he were trampling on her
She dared not look at him but sat with her head bowed
She could not understand why he got into such a tumult and fury
It made her wretched
She did not like Baudelaire on the wholenor Verlaine
Behold her singing in the field Yon solitary highland lass
That nourished her heart
So did Fair Ines
And It was a beauteous evening calm and pure And breathing holy quiet like a nun
These were like herself
And there was he saying in his throat bitterly Tu te rappelleras la beaute des caresses
The poem was finished he took the bread out of the oven arranging the burnt loaves at the bottom of the panchion the good ones at the top
The desiccated loaf remained swathed up in the scullery
Mater neednt know till morning he said
It wont upset her so much then as at night
Miriam looked in the bookcase saw what postcards and letters he had received saw what books were there
She took one that had interested him
Then he turned down the gas and they set off
He did not trouble to lock the door
He was not home again until a quarter to eleven
His mother was seated in the rockingchair
Annie with a rope of hair hanging down her back remained sitting on a low stool before the fire her elbows on her knees gloomily
On the table stood the offending loaf unswathed
Paul entered rather breathless
No one spoke
His mother was reading the little local newspaper
He took off his coat and went to sit down on the sofa
His mother moved curtly aside to let him pass
No one spoke
He was very uncomfortable
For some minutes he sat pretending to read a piece of paper he found on the table
Then I forgot that bread mother he said
There was no answer from either woman
Well he said its only twopence hapenny
I can pay you for that
Being angry he put three pennies on the table and slid them towards his mother
She turned away her head
Her mouth was shut tightly
Yes said Annie you dont know how badly my mother is
The girl sat staring glumly into the fire
Why is she badly
asked Paul in his overbearing way
Well
said Annie
She could scarcely get home
He looked closely at his mother
She looked ill WHY could you scarcely get home
he asked her still sharply
She would not answer
I found her as white as a sheet sitting here said Annie with a suggestion of tears in her voice
Well WHY
insisted Paul
His brows were knitting his eyes dilating passionately
It was enough to upset anybody said Mrs Morel hugging those parcelsmeat and greengroceries and a pair of curtains Well why DID you hug them you neednt have done
Then who would
Let Annie fetch the meat
Yes and I WOULD fetch the meat but how was I to know
You were off with Miriam instead of being in when my mother came
And what was the matter with you
asked Paul of his mother
I suppose its my heart she replied
Certainly she looked bluish round the mouth
And have you felt it before
Yesoften enough
Then why havent you told meand why havent you seen a doctor
Mrs Morel shifted in her chair angry with him for his hectoring
Youd never notice anything said Annie
Youre too eager to be off with Miriam
Oh am Iand any worse than you with Leonard
I was in at a quarter to ten
There was silence in the room for a time
I should have thought said Mrs Morel bitterly that she wouldnt have occupied you so entirely as to burn a whole ovenful of bread
Beatrice was here as well as she
Very likely
But we know why the bread is spoilt
Why
he flashed
Because you were engrossed with Miriam replied Mrs Morel hotly
Oh very wellthen it was NOT
he replied angrily
He was distressed and wretched
Seizing a paper he began to read
Annie her blouse unfastened her long ropes of hair twisted into a plait went up to bed bidding him a very curt goodnight
Paul sat pretending to read
He knew his mother wanted to upbraid him
He also wanted to know what had made her ill for he was troubled
So instead of running away to bed as he would have liked to do he sat and waited
There was a tense silence
The clock ticked loudly
Youd better go to bed before your father comes in said the mother harshly
And if youre going to have anything to eat youd better get it
I dont want anything
It was his mothers custom to bring him some trifle for supper on Friday night the night of luxury for the colliers
He was too angry to go and find it in the pantry this night
This insulted her
If I WANTED you to go to Selby on Friday night I can imagine the scene said Mrs Morel
But youre never too tired to go if SHE will come for you
Nay you neither want to eat nor drink then
I cant let her go alone
Cant you
And why does she come
Not because I ask her
She doesnt come without you want her Well what if I DO want her he replied
Why nothing if it was sensible or reasonable
But to go trapseing up there miles and miles in the mud coming home at midnight and got to go to Nottingham in the morning If I hadnt youd be just the same
Yes I should because theres no sense in it
Is she so fascinating that you must follow her all that way
Mrs Morel was bitterly sarcastic
She sat still with averted face stroking with a rhythmic jerked movement the black sateen of her apron
It was a movement that hurt Paul to see
I do like her he said but LIKE her
said Mrs Morel in the same biting tones
It seems to me you like nothing and nobody else
Theres neither Annie nor me nor anyone now for you
What nonsense motheryou know I dont love herII tell you I DONT love hershe doesnt even walk with my arm because I dont want her to
Then why do you fly to her so often
I DO like to talk to herI never said I didnt
But I DONT love her
Is there nobody else to talk to
Not about the things we talk of
Theres a lot of things that youre not interested in that What things
Mrs Morel was so intense that Paul began to pant
Whypaintingand books
YOU dont care about Herbert Spencer
No was the sad reply
And YOU wont at my age
Well but I do nowand Miriam does And how do you know Mrs Morel flashed defiantly that I shouldnt
Do you ever try me
But you dont mother you know you dont care whether a pictures decorative or not you dont care what MANNER it is in
How do you know I dont care
Do you ever try me
Do you ever talk to me about these things to try
But its not that that matters to you mother you know ts not
What is it thenwhat is it then that matters to me
she flashed
He knitted his brows with pain
Youre old mother and were young
He only meant that the interests of HER age were not the interests of his
But he realised the moment he had spoken that he had said the wrong thing
Yes I know it wellI am old
And therefore I may stand aside I have nothing more to do with you
You only want me to wait on youthe rest is for Miriam
He could not bear it
Instinctively he realised that he was life to her
And after all she was the chief thing to him the only supreme thing
You know it isnt mother you know it isnt
She was moved to pity by his cry
It looks a great deal like it she said half putting aside her despair
No motherI really DONT love her
I talk to her but I want to come home to you
He had taken off his collar and tie and rose barethroated to go to bed
As he stooped to kiss his mother she threw her arms round his neck hid her face on his shoulder and cried in a whimpering voice so unlike her own that he writhed in agony I cant bear it
I could let another womanbut not her
Shed leave me no room not a bit of room And immediately he hated Miriam bitterly
And Ive neveryou know PaulIve never had a husbandnot really He stroked his mothers hair and his mouth was on her throat
And she exults so in taking you from meshes not like ordinary girls
Well I dont love her mother he murmured bowing his head and hiding his eyes on her shoulder in misery
His mother kissed him a long fervent kiss
My boy
she said in a voice trembling with passionate love
Without knowing he gently stroked her face
There said his mother now go to bed
Youll be so tired in the morning
As she was speaking she heard her husband coming
Theres your fathernow go
Suddenly she looked at him almost as if in fear
Perhaps Im selfish
If you want her take her my boy
His mother looked so strange Paul kissed her trembling
Hamother
he said softly
Morel came in walking unevenly
His hat was over one corner of his eye
He balanced in the doorway
At your mischief again
he said venomously
Mrs Morels emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkard who had come in thus upon her
At any rate it is sober she said
Hmhm
hmhm
he sneered
He went into the passage hung up his hat and coat
Then they heard him go down three steps to the pantry
He returned with a piece of porkpie in his fist
It was what Mrs Morel had bought for her son
Nor was that bought for you
If you can give me no more than twentyfive shillings Im sure Im not going to buy you porkpie to stuff after youve swilled a bellyful of beer
Whaatwhaat
snarled Morel toppling in his balance
Whaatnot for me
He looked at the piece of meat and crust and suddenly in a vicious spurt of temper flung it into the fire
Paul started to his feet
Waste your own stuff
he cried
Whatwhat
suddenly shouted Morel jumping up and clenching his fist
Ill show yer yer young jockey
All right
said Paul viciously putting his head on one side
Show me
He would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smack at something
Morel was half crouching fists up ready to spring
The young man stood smiling with his lips
Ussha
hissed the father swiping round with a great stroke just past his sons face
He dared not even though so close really touch the young man but swerved an inch away
Right
said Paul his eyes upon the side of his fathers mouth where in another instant his fist would have hit
He ached for that stroke
But he heard a faint moan from behind
His mother was deadly pale and dark at the mouth
Morel was dancing up to deliver another blow
Father
said Paul so that the word rang
Morel started and stood at attention
Mother
moaned the boy
Mother
She began to struggle with herself
Her open eyes watched him although she could not move
Gradually she was coming to herself
He laid her down on the sofa and ran upstairs for a little whisky which at last she could sip
The tears were hopping down his face
As he kneeled in front of her he did not cry but the tears ran down his face quickly
Morel on the opposite side of the room sat with his elbows on his knees glaring across
Whats amatter with er
he asked
Faint
replied Paul
Hm
The elderly man began to unlace his boots
He stumbled off to bed
His last fight was fought in that home
Paul kneeled there stroking his mothers hand
Dont be poorly motherdont be poorly
he said time after time
Its nothing my boy she murmured
At last he rose fetched in a large piece of coal and raked the fire
Then he cleared the room put everything straight laid the things for breakfast and brought his mothers candle
Can you go to bed mother
Yes Ill come
Sleep with Annie mother not with him
No
Ill sleep in my own bed
Dont sleep with him mother
Ill sleep in my own bed
She rose and he turned out the gas then followed her closely upstairs carrying her candle
On the landing he kissed her close
Goodnight mother
Goodnight
she said
He pressed his face upon the pillow in a fury of misery
And yet somewhere in his soul he was at peace because he still loved his mother best
It was the bitter peace of resignation
The efforts of his father to conciliate him next day were a great humiliation to him
Everybody tried to forget the scene
CHAPTER IX DEFEAT OF MIRIAM PAUL was dissatisfied with himself and with everything
The deepest of his love belonged to his mother
When he felt he had hurt her or wounded his love for her he could not bear it
Now it was spring and there was battle between him and Miriam
This year he had a good deal against her
She was vaguely aware of it
The old feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love which she had had when she prayed was mingled in all her emotions
She did not at the bottom believe she ever would have him
She did not believe in herself primarily doubted whether she could ever be what he would demand of her
Certainly she never saw herself living happily through a lifetime with him
She saw tragedy sorrow and sacrifice ahead
And in sacrifice she was proud in renunciation she was strong for she did not trust herself to support everyday life
She was prepared for the big things and the deep things like tragedy
It was the sufficiency of the small daylife she could not trust
The Easter holidays began happily
Paul was his own frank self
Yet she felt it would go wrong
On the Sunday afternoon she stood at her bedroom window looking across at the oaktrees of the wood in whose branches a twilight was tangled below the bright sky of the afternoon
Greygreen rosettes of honeysuckle leaves hung before the window some already she fancied showing bud
It was spring which she loved and dreaded
Hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense
It was a bright grey day
Paul came into the yard with his bicycle which glittered as he walked
Usually he rang his bell and laughed towards the house
Today he walked with shut lips and cold cruel bearing that had something of a slouch and a sneer in it
She knew him well by now and could tell from that keenlooking aloof young body of his what was happening inside him
There was a cold correctness in the way he put his bicycle in its place that made her heart sink
She came downstairs nervously
She was wearing a new net blouse that she thought became her
It had a high collar with a tiny ruff reminding her of Mary Queen of Scots and making her she thought look wonderfully a woman and dignified
At twenty she was fullbreasted and luxuriously formed
Her face was still like a soft rich mask unchangeable
But her eyes once lifted were wonderful
She was afraid of him
He would notice her new blouse
He being in a hard ironical mood was entertaining the family to a description of a service given in the Primitive Methodist Chapel conducted by one of the wellknown preachers of the sect
He sat at the head of the table his mobile face with the eyes that could be so beautiful shining with tenderness or dancing with laughter now taking on one expression and then another in imitation of various people he was mocking
His mockery always hurt her it was too near the reality
He was too clever and cruel
She felt that when his eyes were like this hard with mocking hate he would spare neither himself nor anybody else
But Mrs Leivers was wiping her eyes with laughter and Mr Leivers just awake from his Sunday nap was rubbing his head in amusement
The three brothers sat with ruffled sleepy appearance in their shirtsleeves giving a guffaw from time to time
The whole family loved a takeoff more than anything
He took no notice of Miriam
Later she saw him remark her new blouse saw that the artist approved but it won from him not a spark of warmth
She was nervous could hardly reach the teacups from the shelves
When the men went out to milk she ventured to address him personally
You were late she said
Was I
he answered
There was silence for a while
Was it rough riding
she asked
I didnt notice it
She continued quickly to lay the table
When she had finished Tea wont be for a few minutes
Will you come and look at the daffodils
she said
He rose without answering
They went out into the back garden under the budding damsontrees
The hills and the sky were clean and cold
Everything looked washed rather hard
Miriam glanced at Paul
He was pale and impassive
It seemed cruel to her that his eyes and brows which she loved could look so hurting
Has the wind made you tired
she asked
She detected an underneath feeling of weariness about him
No I think not he answered
It must be rough on the roadthe wood moans so
You can see by the clouds its a southwest wind that helps me here
You see I dont cycle so I dont understand she murmured
Is there need to cycle to know that
he said
She thought his sarcasms were unnecessary
They went forward in silence
Round the wild tussocky lawn at the back of the house was a thorn hedge under which daffodils were craning forward from among their sheaves of greygreen blades
The cheeks of the flowers were greenish with cold
But still some had burst and their gold ruffled and glowed
Miriam went on her knees before one cluster took a wildlooking daffodil between her hands turned up its face of gold to her and bowed down caressing it with her mouth and cheeks and brow
He stood aside with his hands in his pockets watching her
One after another she turned up to him the faces of the yellow bursten flowers appealingly fondling them lavishly all the while
Arent they magnificent
she murmured
Magnificent
Its a bit thicktheyre pretty
She bowed again to her flowers at his censure of her praise
He watched her crouching sipping the flowers with fervid kisses
Why must you always be fondling things
he said irritably
But I love to touch them she replied hurt
Can you never like things without clutching them as if you wanted to pull the heart out of them
Why dont you have a bit more restraint or reserve or something
She looked up at him full of pain then continued slowly to stroke her lips against a ruffled flower
Their scent as she smelled it was so much kinder than he it almost made her cry
You wheedle the soul out of things he said
I would never wheedleat any rate Id go straight
He scarcely knew what he was saying
These things came from him mechanically
She looked at him
His body seemed one weapon firm and hard against her
Youre always begging things to love you he said as if you were a beggar for love
Even the flowers you have to fawn on them Rhythmically Miriam was swaying and stroking the flower with her mouth inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudder as it came to her nostrils
You dont want to loveyour eternal and abnormal craving is to be loved
You arent positive youre negative
You absorb absorb as if you must fill yourself up with love because youve got a shortage somewhere
She was stunned by his cruelty and did not hear
He had not the faintest notion of what he was saying
It was as if his fretted tortured soul run hot by thwarted passion jetted off these sayings like sparks from electricity
She did not grasp anything he said
She only sat crouched beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her
She never realised in a flash
Over everything she brooded and brooded
After tea he stayed with Edgar and the brothers taking no notice of Miriam
She extremely unhappy on this lookedfor holiday waited for him
And at last he yielded and came to her
She was determined to track this mood of his to its origin
She counted it not much more than a mood
Shall we go through the wood a little way
she asked him knowing he never refused a direct request
They went down to the warren
On the middle path they passed a trap a narrow horseshoe hedge of small firboughs baited with the guts of a rabbit
Paul glanced at it frowning
She caught his eye
Isnt it dreadful
she asked
I dont know
Is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a rabbits throat
One weasel or many rabbits
One or the other must go
He was taking the bitterness of life badly
She was rather sorry for him
We will go back to the house he said
I dont want to walk out
They went past the lilactree whose bronze leafbuds were coming unfastened
Just a fragment remained of the haystack a monument squared and brown like a pillar of stone
There was a little bed of hay from the last cutting
Let us sit here a minute said Miriam
He sat down against his will resting his back against the hard wall of hay
They faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowed with sunset tiny white farms standing out the meadows golden the woods dark and yet luminous treetops folded over treetops distinct in the distance
The evening had cleared and the east was tender with a magenta flush under which the land lay still and rich
Isnt it beautiful
she pleaded
But he only scowled
He would rather have had it ugly just then
At that moment a big bullterrier came rushing up openmouthed pranced his two paws on the youths shoulders licking his face
Paul drew back laughing
Bill was a great relief to him
He pushed the dog aside but it came leaping back
Get out said the lad or Ill dot thee one
But the dog was not to be pushed away
So Paul had a little battle with the creature pitching poor Bill away from him who however only floundered tumultuously back again wild with joy
The two fought together the man laughing grudgingly the dog grinning all over
Miriam watched them
There was something pathetic about the man
He wanted so badly to love to be tender
The rough way he bowled the dog over was really loving
Bill got up panting with happiness his brown eyes rolling in his white face and lumbered back again
He adored Paul
The lad frowned
Bill Ive had enough o thee he said
But the dog only stood with two heavy paws that quivered with love upon his thigh and flickered a red tongue at him
He drew back
No he saidnoIve had enough
And in a minute the dog trotted off happily to vary the fun
He remained staring miserably across at the hills whose still beauty he begrudged
He wanted to go and cycle with Edgar
Yet he had not the courage to leave Miriam
Why are you sad
she asked humbly
Im not sad why should I be he answered
Im only normal
She wondered why he always claimed to be normal when he was disagreeable
But what is the matter
she pleaded coaxing him soothingly
Nothing
Nay
she murmured
He picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it
Youd far better not talk he said
But I wish to know she replied
He laughed resentfully
You always do he said
Its not fair to me she murmured
He thrust thrust thrust at the ground with the pointed stick digging up little clods of earth as if he were in a fever of irritation
She gently and firmly laid her band on his wrist
Dont
she said
Put it away
He flung the stick into the currantbushes and leaned back
Now he was bottled up
What is it
she pleaded softly
He lay perfectly still only his eyes alive and they full of torment
You know he said at length rather wearilyyou knowwed better break off
It was what she dreaded
Swiftly everything seemed to darken before her eyes
Why
she murmured
What has happened
Nothing has happened
We only realise where we are
Its no good She waited in silence sadly patiently
It was no good being impatient with him
At any rate he would tell her now what ailed him
We agreed on friendship he went on in a dull monotonous voice
How often HAVE we agreed for friendship
And yetit neither stops there nor gets anywhere else
He was silent again
She brooded
What did he mean
He was so wearying
There was something he would not yield
Yet she must be patient with him
I can only give friendshipits all Im capable ofits a flaw in my makeup
The thing overbalances to one sideI hate a toppling balance
Let us have done
There was warmth of fury in his last phrases
He meant she loved him more than he her
Perhaps he could not love her
Perhaps she had not in herself that which he wanted
It was the deepest motive of her soul this selfmistrust
It was so deep she dared neither realise nor acknowledge
Perhaps she was deficient
Like an infinitely subtle shame it kept her always back
If it were so she would do without him
She would never let herself want him
She would merely see
But what has happened
she said
Nothingits all in myselfit only comes out just now
Were always like this towards Eastertime
He grovelled so helplessly she pitied him
At least she never floundered in such a pitiable way
After all it was he who was chiefly humiliated
What do you want
she asked him
WhyI mustnt come oftenthats all
Why should I monopolise you when Im not You see Im deficient in something with regard to you He was telling her he did not love her and so ought to leave her a chance with another man
How foolish and blind and shamefully clumsy he was
What were other men to her
What were men to her at all
But he ah
she loved his soul
Was HE deficient in something
Perhaps he was
But I dont understand she said huskily
Yesterday The night was turning jangled and hateful to him as the twilight faded
And she bowed under her suffering
I know he cried you never will
Youll never believe that I cantcant physically any more than I can fly up like a skylark What
she murmured
Now she dreaded
Love you
He hated her bitterly at that moment because he made her suffer
Love her
She knew he loved her
He really belonged to her
This about not loving her physically bodily was a mere perversity on his part because he knew she loved him
He was stupid like a child
He belonged to her
His soul wanted her
She guessed somebody had been influencing him
She felt upon him the hardness the foreignness of another influence
What have they been saying at home
she asked
Its not that he answered
And then she knew it was
She despised them for their commonness his people
They did not know what things were really worth
He and she talked very little more that night
After all he left her to cycle with Edgar
He had come back to his mother
Hers was the strongest tie in his life
When he thought round Miriam shrank away
There was a vague unreal feel about her
And nobody else mattered
There was one place in the world that stood solid and did not melt into unreality the place where his mother was
Everybody else could grow shadowy almost nonexistent to him but she could not
It was as if the pivot and pole of his life from which he could not escape was his mother
And in the same way she waited for him
In him was established her life now
After all the life beyond offered very little to Mrs Morel
She saw that our chance for DOING is here and doing counted with her
Paul was going to prove that she had been right he was going to make a man whom nothing should shift off his feet he was going to alter the face of the earth in some way which mattered
Wherever he went she felt her soul went with him
Whatever he did she felt her soul stood by him ready as it were to hand him his tools
She could not bear it when he was with Miriam
William was dead
She would fight to keep Paul
And he came back to her
And in his soul was a feeling of the satisfaction of selfsacrifice because he was faithful to her
She loved him first he loved her first
And yet it was not enough
His new young life so strong and imperious was urged towards something else
It made him mad with restlessness
She saw this and wished bitterly that Miriam had been a woman who could take this new life of his and leave her the roots
He fought against his mother almost as he fought against Miriam
It was a week before he went again to Willey Farm
Miriam had suffered a great deal and was afraid to see him again
Was she now to endure the ignominy of his abandoning her
That would only be superficial and temporary
He would come back
She held the keys to his soul
But meanwhile how he would torture her with his battle against her
She shrank from it
However the Sunday after Easter he came to tea
Mrs Leivers was glad to see him
She gathered something was fretting him that he found things hard
He seemed to drift to her for comfort
And she was good to him
She did him that great kindness of treating him almost with reverence
He met her with the young children in the front garden
Im glad youve come said the mother looking at him with her great appealing brown eyes
It is such a sunny day
I was just going down the fields for the first time this year
He felt she would like him to come
That soothed him
They went talking simply he gentle and humble
He could have wept with gratitude that she was deferential to him
He was feeling humiliated
At the bottom of the Mow Close they found a thrushs nest
Shall I show you the eggs
he said
Do
replied Mrs Leivers
They seem SUCH a sign of spring and so hopeful
He put aside the thorns and took out the eggs holding them in the palm of his hand
They are quite hotI think we frightened her off them he said
Ay poor thing
said Mrs Leivers
Miriam could not help touching the eggs and his hand which it seemed to her cradled them so well
Isnt it a strange warmth
she murmured to get near him
Blood heat he answered
She watched him putting them back his body pressed against the hedge his arm reaching slowly through the thorns his hand folded carefully over the eggs
He was concentrated on the act
Seeing him so she loved him he seemed so simple and sufficient to himself
And she could not get to him
After tea she stood hesitating at the bookshelf
He took Tartarin de Tarascon
Again they sat on the bank of hay at the foot of the stack
He read a couple of pages but without any heart for it
Again the dog came racing up to repeat the fun of the other day
He shoved his muzzle in the mans chest
Paul fingered his ear for a moment
Then he pushed him away
Go away Bill he said
I dont want you
Bill slunk off and Miriam wondered and dreaded what was coming
There was a silence about the youth that made her still with apprehension
It was not his furies but his quiet resolutions that she feared
Turning his face a little to one side so that she could not see him he began speaking slowly and painfully Do you thinkif I didnt come up so muchyou might get to like somebody elseanother man
So this was what he was still harping on
But I dont know any other men
Why do you ask
she replied in a low tone that should have been a reproach to him
Why he blurted because they say Ive no right to come up like thiswithout we mean to marry Miriam was indignant at anybodys forcing the issues between them
She had been furious with her own father for suggesting to Paul laughingly that he knew why he came so much
Who says
she asked wondering if her people had anything to do with it
They had not
Motherand the others
They say at this rate everybody will consider me engaged and I ought to consider myself so because its not fair to you
And Ive tried to find outand I dont think I love you as a man ought to love his wife
What do you think about it
Miriam bowed her head moodily
She was angry at having this struggle
People should leave him and her alone
I dont know she murmured
Do you think we love each other enough to marry
he asked definitely
It made her tremble
No she answered truthfully
I dont think sowere too young
I thought perhaps he went on miserably that you with your intensity in things might have given me morethan I could ever make up to you
And even nowif you think it betterwell be engaged
Now Miriam wanted to cry
And she was angry too
He was always such a child for people to do as they liked with
No I dont think so she said firmly
He pondered a minute
You see he said with meI dont think one person would ever monopolize mebe everything to meI think never
This she did not consider
No she murmured
Then after a pause she looked at him and her dark eyes flashed
This is your mother she said
I know she never liked me
No no it isnt he said hastily
It was for your sake she spoke this time
She only said if I was going on I ought to consider myself engaged
There was a silence
And if I ask you to come down any time you wont stop away will you
She did not answer
By this time she was very angry
Well what shall we do
she said shortly
I suppose Id better drop French
I was just beginning to get on with it
But I suppose I can go on alone
I dont see that we need he said
I can give you a French lesson surely
Welland there are Sunday nights
I shant stop coming to chapel because I enjoy it and its all the social life I get
But youve no need to come home with me
I can go alone
All right he answered rather taken aback
But if I ask Edgar hell always come with us and then they can say nothing
There was silence
After all then she would not lose much
For all their talk down at his home there would not be much difference
She wished they would mind their own business
And you wont think about it and let it trouble you will you
he asked
Oh no replied Miriam without looking at him
He was silent
She thought him unstable
He had no fixity of purpose no anchor of righteousness that held him
Because he continued a man gets across his bicycleand goes to workand does all sorts of things
But a woman broods
No I shant bother said Miriam
And she meant it
It had gone rather chilly
They went indoors
How white Paul looks
Mrs Leivers exclaimed
Miriam you shouldnt have let him sit out of doors
Do you think youve taken cold Paul
Oh no
he laughed
But he felt done up
It wore him out the conflict in himself
Miriam pitied him now
But quite early before nine oclock he rose to go
Youre not going home are you
asked Mrs Leivers anxiously
Yes he replied
I said Id be early
He was very awkward
But this IS early said Mrs Leivers
Miriam sat in the rockingchair and did not speak
He hesitated expecting her to rise and go with him to the barn as usual for his bicycle
She remained as she was
He was at a loss
Wellgoodnight all
he faltered
She spoke her goodnight along with all the others
But as he went past the window he looked in
She saw him pale his brows knit slightly in a way that had become constant with him his eyes dark with pain
She rose and went to the doorway to wave goodbye to him as he passed through the gate
He rode slowly under the pinetrees feeling a cur and a miserable wretch
His bicycle went tilting down the hills at random
He thought it would be a relief to break ones neck
Two days later he sent her up a book and a little note urging her to read and be busy
At this time he gave all his friendship to Edgar
He loved the family so much he loved the farm so much it was the dearest place on earth to him
His home was not so lovable
It was his mother
But then he would have been just as happy with his mother anywhere
Whereas Willey Farm he loved passionately
He loved the little pokey kitchen where mens boots tramped and the dog slept with one eye open for fear of being trodden on where the lamp hung over the table at night and everything was so silent
He loved Miriams long low parlour with its atmosphere of romance its flowers its books its high rosewood piano
He loved the gardens and the buildings that stood with their scarlet roofs on the naked edges of the fields crept towards the wood as if for cosiness the wild country scooping down a valley and up the uncultured hills of the other side
Only to be there was an exhilaration and a joy to him
He loved Mrs Leivers with her unworldliness and her quaint cynicism he loved Mr Leivers so warm and young and lovable he loved Edgar who lit up when he came and the boys and the children and Billeven the sow Circe and the Indian gamecock called Tippoo
All this besides Miriam
He could not give it up
So he went as often but he was usually with Edgar
Only all the family including the father joined in charades and games at evening
And later Miriam drew them together and they read Macbeth out of penny books taking parts
It was great excitement
Miriam was glad and Mrs Leivers was glad and Mr Leivers enjoyed it
Then they all learned songs together from tonic solfa singing in a circle round the fire
But now Paul was very rarely alone with Miriam
She waited
When she and Edgar and he walked home together from chapel or from the literary society in Bestwood she knew his talk so passionate and so unorthodox nowadays was for her
She did envy Edgar however his cycling with Paul his Friday nights his days working in the fields
For her Friday nights and her French lessons were gone
She was nearly always alone walking pondering in the wood reading studying dreaming waiting
And he wrote to her frequently
One Sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony
Edgar had stayed to Communionhe wondered what it was likewith Mrs Morel
So Paul came on alone with Miriam to his home
He was more or less under her spell again
As usual they were discussing the sermon
He was setting now full sail towards Agnosticism but such a religious Agnosticism that Miriam did not suffer so badly
They were at the Renan Vie de Jesus stage
Miriam was the threshingfloor on which he threshed out all his beliefs
While he trampled his ideas upon her soul the truth came out for him
She alone was his threshingfloor
She alone helped him towards realization
Almost impassive she submitted to his argument and expounding
And somehow because of her he gradually realized where he was wrong
And what he realized she realized
She felt he could not do without her
They came to the silent house
He took the key out of the scullery window and they entered
All the time he went on with his discussion
He lit the gas mended the fire and brought her some cakes from the pantry
She sat on the sofa quietly with a plate on her knee
She wore a large white hat with some pinkish flowers
It was a cheap hat but he liked it
Her face beneath was still and pensive goldenbrown and ruddy
Always her ears were hid in her short curls
She watched him
She liked him on Sundays
Then he wore a dark suit that showed the lithe movement of his body
There was a clean clearcut look about him
He went on with his thinking to her
Suddenly he reached for a Bible
Miriam liked the way he reached upso sharp straight to the mark
He turned the pages quickly and read her a chapter of St John
As he sat in the armchair reading intent his voice only thinking she felt as if he were using her unconsciously as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent on
She loved it
And the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to something and it was as if she were what he reached with
She sat back on the sofa away from him and yet feeling herself the very instrument his hand grasped
It gave her great pleasure
Then he began to falter and to get selfconscious
And when he came to the verse A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come he missed it out
Miriam had felt him growing uncomfortable
She shrank when the wellknown words did not follow
He went on reading but she did not hear
A grief and shame made her bend her head
Six months ago he would have read it simply
Now there was a scotch in his running with her
Now she felt there was really something hostile between them something of which they were ashamed
She ate her cake mechanically
He tried to go on with his argument but could not get back the right note
Soon Edgar came in
Mrs Morel had gone to her friends
The three set off to Willey Farm
Miriam brooded over his split with her
There was something else he wanted
He could not be satisfied he could give her no peace
There was between them now always a ground for strife
She wanted to prove him
She believed that his chief need in life was herself
If she could prove it both to herself and to him the rest might go she could simply trust to the future
So in May she asked him to come to Willey Farm and meet Mrs Dawes
There was something he hankered after
She saw him whenever they spoke of Clara Dawes rouse and get slightly angry
He said he did not like her
Yet he was keen to know about her
Well he should put himself to the test
She believed that there were in him desires for higher things and desires for lower and that the desire for the higher would conquer
At any rate he should try
She forgot that her higher and lower were arbitrary
He was rather excited at the idea of meeting Clara at Willey Farm
Mrs Dawes came for the day
Her heavy duncoloured hair was coiled on top of her head
She wore a white blouse and navy skirt and somehow wherever she was seemed to make things look paltry and insignificant
When she was in the room the kitchen seemed too small and mean altogether
Miriams beautiful twilighty parlour looked stiff and stupid
All the Leivers were eclipsed like candles
They found her rather hard to put up with
Yet she was perfectly amiable but indifferent and rather hard
Paul did not come till afternoon
He was early
As he swung off his bicycle Miriam saw him look round at the house eagerly
He would be disappointed if the visitor had not come
Miriam went out to meet him bowing her head because of the sunshine
Nasturtiums were coming out crimson under the cool green shadow of their leaves
The girl stood darkhaired glad to see him
Hasnt Clara come
he asked
Yes replied Miriam in her musical tone
Shes reading
He wheeled his bicycle into the barn
He had put on a handsome tie of which he was rather proud and socks to match
She came this morning
he asked
Yes replied Miriam as she walked at his side
You said youd bring me that letter from the man at Libertys
Have you remembered
Oh dash no
he said
But nag at me till you get it
I dont like to nag at you
Do it whether or not
And is she any more agreeable
he continued
You know I always think she is quite agreeable
He was silent
Evidently his eagerness to be early today had been the newcomer
Miriam already began to suffer
They went together towards the house
He took the clips off his trousers but was too lazy to brush the dust from his shoes in spite of the socks and tie
Clara sat in the cool parlour reading
He saw the nape of her white neck and the fine hair lifted from it
She rose looking at him indifferently
To shake hands she lifted her arm straight in a manner that seemed at once to keep him at a distance and yet to fling something to him
He noticed how her breasts swelled inside her blouse and how her shoulder curved handsomely under the thin muslin at the top of her arm
You have chosen a fine day he said
It happens so she said
Yes he said I am glad
She sat down not thanking him for his politeness
What have you been doing all morning
asked Paul of Miriam
Well you see said Miriam coughing huskily Clara only came with fatherand soshes not been here very long
Clara sat leaning on the table holding aloof
He noticed her hands were large but well kept
And the skin on them seemed almost coarse opaque and white with fine golden hairs
She did not mind if he observed her hands
She intended to scorn him
Her heavy arm lay negligently on the table
Her mouth was closed as if she were offended and she kept her face slightly averted
You were at Margaret Bonfords meeting the other evening he said to her
Miriam did not know this courteous Paul
Clara glanced at him
Yes she said
Why asked Miriam how do you know
I went in for a few minutes before the train came he answered
Clara turned away again rather disdainfully
I think shes a lovable little woman said Paul
Margaret Bonford
exclaimed Clara
Shes a great deal cleverer than most men
Well I didnt say she wasnt he said deprecating
Shes lovable for all that
And of course that is all that matters said Clara witheringly
He rubbed his head rather perplexed rather annoyed
I suppose it matters more than her cleverness he said which after all would never get her to heaven
Its not heaven she wants to getits her fair share on earth retorted Clara
She spoke as if he were responsible for some deprivation which Miss Bonford suffered
Well he said I thought she was warm and awfully niceonly too frail
I wished she was sitting comfortably in peace Darning her husbands stockings said Clara scathingly
Im sure she wouldnt mind darning even my stockings he said
And Im sure shed do them well
Just as I wouldnt mind blacking her boots if she wanted me to
But Clara refused to answer this sally of his
He talked to Miriam for a little while
The other woman held aloof
Well he said I think Ill go and see Edgar
Is he on the land
I believe said Miriam hes gone for a load of coal
He should be back directly
Then he said Ill go and meet him
Miriam dared not propose anything for the three of them
He rose and left them
On the top road where the gorse was out he saw Edgar walking lazily beside the mare who nodded her whitestarred forehead as she dragged the clanking load of coal
The young farmers face lighted up as he saw his friend
Edgar was goodlooking with dark warm eyes
His clothes were old and rather disreputable and he walked with considerable pride
Hello
he said seeing Paul bareheaded
Where are you going
Came to meet you
Cant stand Nevermore
Edgars teeth flashed in a laugh of amusement
Who is Nevermore
he asked
The ladyMrs Dawesit ought to be Mrs
The Raven that quothed Nevermore
Edgar laughed with glee
Dont you like her
he asked
Not a fat lot said Paul
Why do you
No
The answer came with a deep ring of conviction
No
Edgar pursed up his lips
I cant say shes much in my line
He mused a little
Then But why do you call her Nevermore
he asked
Well said Paul if she looks at a man she says haughtily Nevermore and if she looks at herself in the lookingglass she says disdainfully Nevermore and if she thinks back she says it in disgust and if she looks forward she says it cynically
Edgar considered this speech failed to make much out of it and said laughing You think shes a manhater
SHE thinks she is replied Paul
But you dont think so
No replied Paul
Wasnt she nice with you then
Could you imagine her NICE with anybody
asked the young man
Edgar laughed
Together they unloaded the coal in the yard
Paul was rather selfconscious because he knew Clara could see if she looked out of the window
She didnt look
On Saturday afternoons the horses were brushed down and groomed
Paul and Edgar worked together sneezing with the dust that came from the pelts of Jimmy and Flower
Do you know a new song to teach me
said Edgar
He continued to work all the time
The back of his neck was sunred when he bent down and his fingers that held the brush were thick
Paul watched him sometimes
Mary Morrison
suggested the younger
Edgar agreed
He had a good tenor voice and he loved to learn all the songs his friend could teach him so that he could sing whilst he was carting
Paul had a very indifferent baritone voice but a good ear
However he sang softly for fear of Clara
Edgar repeated the line in a clear tenor
At times they both broke off to sneeze and first one then the other abused his horse
Miriam was impatient of men
It took so little to amuse themeven Paul
She thought it anomalous in him that he could be so thoroughly absorbed in a triviality
It was teatime when they had finished
What song was that
asked Miriam
Edgar told her
The conversation turned to singing
We have such jolly times Miriam said to Clara
Mrs Dawes ate her meal in a slow dignified way
Whenever the men were present she grew distant
Do you like singing
Miriam asked her
If it is good she said
Paul of course coloured
You mean if it is highclass and trained
he said
I think a voice needs training before the singing is anything she said
You might as well insist on having peoples voices trained before you allowed them to talk he replied
Really people sing for their own pleasure as a rule
And it may be for other peoples discomfort
Then the other people should have flaps to their ears he replied
The boys laughed
There was a silence
He flushed deeply and ate in silence
After tea when all the men had gone but Paul Mrs Leivers said to Clara And you find life happier now
Infinitely
And you are satisfied
So long as I can be free and independent
And you dont MISS anything in your life
asked Mrs Leivers gently
Ive put all that behind me
Paul had been feeling uncomfortable during this discourse
He got up
Youll find youre always tumbling over the things youve put behind you he said
Then he took his departure to the cowsheds
He felt he had been witty and his manly pride was high
He whistled as he went down the brick track
Miriam came for him a little later to know if he would go with Clara and her for a walk
They set off down to Strelley Mill Farm
As they were going beside the brook on the Willey Water side looking through the brake at the edge of the wood where pink campions glowed under a few sunbeams they saw beyond the treetrunks and the thin hazel bushes a man leading a great bay horse through the gullies
The big red beast seemed to dance romantically through that dimness of green hazel drift away there where the air was shadowy as if it were in the past among the fading bluebells that might have bloomed for Deidre or Iseult
The three stood charmed
What a treat to be a knight he said and to have a pavilion here
And to have us shut up safely
replied Clara
Yes he answered singing with your maids at your broidery
I would carry your banner of white and green and heliotrope
I would have WSPU
emblazoned on my shield beneath a woman rampant
I have no doubt said Clara that you would much rather fight for a woman than let her fight for herself
I would
When she fights for herself she seems like a dog before a lookingglass gone into a mad fury with its own shadow
And YOU are the lookingglass
she asked with a curl of the lip
Or the shadow he replied
I am afraid she said that you are too clever
Well I leave it to you to be GOOD he retorted laughing
Be good sweet maid and just let ME be clever
But Clara wearied of his flippancy
Suddenly looking at her he saw that the upward lifting of her face was misery and not scorn
His heart grew tender for everybody
He turned and was gentle with Miriam whom he had neglected till then
At the woods edge they met Limb a thin swarthy man of forty tenant of Strelley Mill which he ran as a cattleraising farm
He held the halter of the powerful stallion indifferently as if he were tired
The three stood to let him pass over the steppingstones of the first brook
Paul admired that so large an animal should walk on such springy toes with an endless excess of vigour
Limb pulled up before them
Tell your father Miss Leivers he said in a peculiar piping voice that his young beases as broke that bottom fence three days an runnin
Which
asked Miriam tremulous
The great horse breathed heavily shifting round its red flanks and looking suspiciously with its wonderful big eyes upwards from under its lowered head and falling mane
Come along a bit replied Limb an Ill show you
The man and the stallion went forward
It danced sideways shaking its white fetlocks and looking frightened as it felt itself in the brook
No hankypankyin said the man affectionately to the beast
It went up the bank in little leaps then splashed finely through the second brook
Clara walking with a kind of sulky abandon watched it halffascinated halfcontemptuous
Limb stopped and pointed to the fence under some willows
There you see where they got through he said
My mans druv em back three times
Yes answered Miriam colouring as if she were at fault
Are you comin in
asked the man
No thanks but we should like to go by the pond
Well just as youve a mind he said
The horse gave little whinneys of pleasure at being so near home
He is glad to be back said Clara who was interested in the creature
Yeses been a tidy step today
They went through the gate and saw approaching them from the big farmhouse a smallish dark excitablelooking woman of about thirtyfive
Her hair was touched with grey her dark eyes looked wild
She walked with her hands behind her back
Her brother went forward
As it saw her the big bay stallion whinneyed again
She came up excitedly
Are you home again my boy
she said tenderly to the horse not to the man
The great beast shifted round to her ducking his head
She smuggled into his mouth the wrinkled yellow apple she had been hiding behind her back then she kissed him near the eyes
He gave a big sigh of pleasure
She held his head in her arms against her breast
Isnt he splendid
said Miriam to her
Miss Limb looked up
Her dark eyes glanced straight at Paul
Oh goodevening Miss Leivers she said
Its ages since youve been down
Miriam introduced her friends
Your horse IS a fine fellow
said Clara
Isnt he
Again she kissed him
As loving as any man
More loving than most men I should think replied Clara
Hes a nice boy
cried the woman again embracing the horse
Clara fascinated by the big beast went up to stroke his neck
Hes quite gentle said Miss Limb
Dont you think big fellows are
Hes a beauty
replied Clara
She wanted to look in his eyes
She wanted him to look at her
Its a pity he cant talk she said
Oh but he canall but replied the other woman
Then her brother moved on with the horse
Are you coming in
DO come in MrI didnt catch it
Morel said Miriam
No we wont come in but we should like to go by the millpond
Yesyes do
Do you fish Mr
Morel
No said Paul
Because if you do you might come and fish any time said Miss Limb
We scarcely see a soul from weeks end to weeks end
I should be thankful
What fish are there in the pond
he asked
They went through the front garden over the sluice and up the steep bank to the pond which lay in shadow with its two wooded islets
Paul walked with Miss Limb
I shouldnt mind swimming here he said
Do she replied
Come when you like
My brother will be awfully pleased to talk with you
He is so quiet because there is no one to talk to
Do come and swim
Clara came up
Its a fine depth she said and so clear
Yes said Miss Limb
Do you swim
said Paul
Miss Limb was just saying we could come when we liked
Of course theres the farmhands said Miss Limb
They talked a few moments then went on up the wild hill leaving the lonely haggardeyed woman on the bank
The hillside was all ripe with sunshine
It was wild and tussocky given over to rabbits
The three walked in silence
Then She makes me feel uncomfortable said Paul
You mean Miss Limb
asked Miriam
Yes
Whats a matter with her
Is she going dotty with being too lonely
Yes said Miriam
Its not the right sort of life for her
I think its cruel to bury her there
I really ought to go and see her more
Butshe upsets me
She makes me feel sorry for heryes and she bothers me he said
I suppose blurted Clara suddenly she wants a man
The other two were silent for a few moments
But its the loneliness sends her cracked said Paul
Clara did not answer but strode on uphill
She was walking with her hand hanging her legs swinging as she kicked through the dead thistles and the tussocky grass her arms hanging loose
Rather than walking her handsome body seemed to be blundering up the hill
A hot wave went over Paul
He was curious about her
Perhaps life had been cruel to her
He forgot Miriam who was walking beside him talking to him
She glanced at him finding he did not answer her
His eyes were fixed ahead on Clara
Do you still think she is disagreeable
she asked
He did not notice that the question was sudden
It ran with his thoughts
Somethings the matter with her he said
Yes answered Miriam
They found at the top of the hill a hidden wild field two sides of which were backed by the wood the other sides by high loose hedges of hawthorn and elder bushes
Between these overgrown bushes were gaps that the cattle might have walked through had there been any cattle now
There the turf was smooth as velveteen padded and holed by the rabbits
The field itself was coarse and crowded with tall big cowslips that had never been cut
Clusters of strong flowers rose everywhere above the coarse tussocks of bent
It was like a roadstead crowded with tan fairy shipping
Ah
cried Miriam and she looked at Paul her dark eyes dilating
He smiled
Together they enjoyed the field of flowers
Clara a little way off was looking at the cowslips disconsolately
Paul and Miriam stayed close together talking in subdued tones
He kneeled on one knee quickly gathering the best blossoms moving from tuft to tuft restlessly talking softly all the time
Miriam plucked the flowers lovingly lingering over them
He always seemed to her too quick and almost scientific
Yet his bunches had a natural beauty more than hers
He loved them but as if they were his and he had a right to them
She had more reverence for them they held something she had not
The flowers were very fresh and sweet
He wanted to drink them
As he gathered them he ate the little yellow trumpets
Clara was still wandering about disconsolately
Going towards her he said Why dont you get some
I dont believe in it
They look better growing
But youd like some
They want to be left
I dont believe they do
I dont want the corpses of flowers about me she said
Thats a stiff artificial notion he said
They dont die any quicker in water than on their roots
And besides they LOOK nice in a bowlthey look jolly
And you only call a thing a corpse because it looks corpselike
Whether it is one or not
she argued
It isnt one to me
A dead flower isnt a corpse of a flower
Clara now ignored him
And even sowhat right have you to pull them
she asked
Because I like them and want themand theres plenty of them
And that is sufficient
Yes
Why not
Im sure theyd smell nice in your room in Nottingham
And I should have the pleasure of watching them die
But thenit does not matter if they do die
Whereupon he left her and went stooping over the clumps of tangled flowers which thickly sprinkled the field like pale luminous foamclots
Miriam had come close
Clara was kneeling breathing some scent from the cowslips
I think said Miriam if you treat them with reverence you dont do them any harm
It is the spirit you pluck them in that matters
Yes he said
But no you get em because you want em and thats all
He held out his bunch
Miriam was silent
He picked some more
Look at these
he continued sturdy and lusty like little trees and like boys with fat legs
Claras hat lay on the grass not far off
She was kneeling bending forward still to smell the flowers
Her neck gave him a sharp pang such a beautiful thing yet not proud of itself just now
Her breasts swung slightly in her blouse
The arching curve of her back was beautiful and strong she wore no stays
Suddenly without knowing he was scattering a handful of cowslips over her hair and neck saying Ashes to ashes and dust to dust If the Lord wont have you the devil must
The chill flowers fell on her neck
She looked up at him with almost pitiful scared grey eyes wondering what he was doing
Flowers fell on her face and she shut her eyes
Suddenly standing there above her he felt awkward
I thought you wanted a funeral he said ill at ease
Clara laughed strangely and rose picking the cowslips from her hair
She took up her hat and pinned it on
One flower had remained tangled in her hair
He saw but would not tell her
He gathered up the flowers he had sprinkled over her
At the edge of the wood the bluebells had flowed over into the field and stood there like floodwater
But they were fading now
Clara strayed up to them
He wandered after her
The bluebells pleased him
Look how theyve come out of the wood
he said
Then she turned with a flash of warmth and of gratitude
Yes she smiled
His blood beat up
It makes me think of the wild men of the woods how terrified they would be when they got breast to breast with the open space
Do you think they were
she asked
I wonder which was more frightened among old tribesthose bursting out of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light or those from the open tiptoeing into the forests
I should think the second she answered
Yes you DO feel like one of the open space sort trying to force yourself into the dark dont you
How should I know
she answered queerly
The conversation ended there
The evening was deepening over the earth
Already the valley was full of shadow
One tiny square of light stood opposite at Crossleigh Bank Farm
Brightness was swimming on the tops of the hills
Miriam came up slowly her face in her big loose bunch of flowers walking ankledeep through the scattered froth of the cowslips
Beyond her the trees were coming into shape all shadow
Shall we go
she asked
And the three turned away
They were all silent
Going down the path they could see the light of home right across and on the ridge of the hill a thin dark outline with little lights where the colliery village touched the sky
It has been nice hasnt it
he asked
Miriam murmured assent
Clara was silent
Dont you think so
he persisted
But she walked with her head up and still did not answer
He could tell by the way she moved as if she didnt care that she suffered
At this time Paul took his mother to Lincoln
She was bright and enthusiastic as ever but as he sat opposite her in the railway carriage she seemed to look frail
He had a momentary sensation as if she were slipping away from him
Then he wanted to get hold of her to fasten her almost to chain her
He felt he must keep hold of her with his hand
They drew near to the city
Both were at the window looking for the cathedral
There she is mother
he cried
They saw the great cathedral lying couchant above the plain
Ah
she exclaimed
So she is
He looked at his mother
Her blue eyes were watching the cathedral quietly
She seemed again to be beyond him
Something in the eternal repose of the uplifted cathedral blue and noble against the sky was reflected in her something of the fatality
What was WAS
With all his young will he could not alter it
He saw her face the skin still fresh and pink and downy but crowsfeet near her eyes her eyelids steady sinking a little her mouth always closed with disillusion and there was on her the same eternal look as if she knew fate at last
He beat against it with all the strength of his soul
Look mother how big she is above the town
Think there are streets and streets below her
She looks bigger than the city altogether
So she does
exclaimed his mother breaking bright into life again
But he had seen her sitting looking steady out of the window at the cathedral her face and eyes fixed reflecting the relentlessness of life
And the crowsfeet near her eyes and her mouth shut so hard made him feel he would go mad
They ate a meal that she considered wildly extravagant
Dont imagine I like it she said as she ate her cutlet
I DONT like it I really dont
Just THINK of your money wasted
You never mind my money he said
You forget Im a fellow taking his girl for an outing
And he bought her some blue violets
Stop it at once sir
she commanded
How can I do it
Youve got nothing to do
Stand still
And in the middle of High Street he stuck the flowers in her coat
An old thing like me
she said sniffing
You see he said I want people to think were awful swells
So look ikey
Ill jowl your head she laughed
Strut
he commanded
Be a fantail pigeon
It took him an hour to get her through the street
She stood above Glory Hole she stood before Stone Bow she stood everywhere and exclaimed
A man came up took off his hat and bowed to her
Can I show you the town madam
No thank you she answered
Ive got my son
Then Paul was cross with her for not answering with more dignity
You go away with you
she exclaimed
Ha
thats the Jews House
Now do you remember that lecture Paul
But she could scarcely climb the cathedral hill
He did not notice
Then suddenly he found her unable to speak
He took her into a little publichouse where she rested
Its nothing she said
My heart is only a bit old one must expect it
He did not answer but looked at her
Again his heart was crushed in a hot grip
He wanted to cry he wanted to smash things in fury
They set off again pace by pace so slowly
And every step seemed like a weight on his chest
He felt as if his heart would burst
At last they came to the top
She stood enchanted looking at the castle gate looking at the cathedral front
She had quite forgotten herself
Now THIS is better than I thought it could be
she cried
But he hated it
Everywhere he followed her brooding
They sat together in the cathedral
They attended a little service in the choir
She was timid
I suppose it is open to anybody
she asked him
Yes he replied
Do you think theyd have the damned cheek to send us away
Well Im sure she exclaimed they would if they heard your language
Her face seemed to shine again with joy and peace during the service
And all the time he was wanting to rage and smash things and cry
Afterwards when they were leaning over the wall looking at the town below he blurted suddenly Why cant a man have a YOUNG mother
What is she old for
Well his mother laughed she can scarcely help it
And why wasnt I the oldest son
Lookthey say the young ones have the advantagebut look THEY had the young mother
You should have had me for your eldest son
I didnt arrange it she remonstrated
Come to consider youre as much to blame as me
He turned on her white his eyes furious
What are you old for
he said mad with his impotence
WHY cant you walk
WHY cant you come with me to places
At one time she replied I could have run up that hill a good deal better than you
Whats the good of that to ME
he cried hitting his fist on the wall
Then he became plaintive
Its too bad of you to be ill Little it is Ill
she cried
Im a bit old and youll have to put up with it thats all
They were quiet
But it was as much as they could bear
They got jolly again over tea
As they sat by Brayford watching the boats he told her about Clara
His mother asked him innumerable questions
Then who does she live with
With her mother on Bluebell Hill
And have they enough to keep them
I dont think so
I think they do lace work
And wherein lies her charm my boy
I dont know that shes charming mother
But shes nice
And she seems straight you knownot a bit deep not a bit
But shes a good deal older than you
Shes thirty Im going on twentythree
You havent told me what you like her for
Because I dont knowa sort of defiant way shes gota sort of angry way
Mrs Morel considered
She would have been glad now for her son to fall in love with some woman who wouldshe did not know what
But he fretted so got so furious suddenly and again was melancholic
She wished he knew some nice woman She did not know what she wished but left it vague
At any rate she was not hostile to the idea of Clara
Annie too was getting married
Leonard had gone away to work in Birmingham
One weekend when he was home she had said to him You dont look very well my lad
I dunno he said
I feel anyhow or nohow ma
He called her ma already in his boyish fashion
Are you sure theyre good lodgings
she asked
Yesyes
Onlyits a winder when you have to pour your own tea outan nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and sup it up
It somehow takes a the taste out of it
Mrs Morel laughed
And so it knocks you up
she said
I dunno
I want to get married he blurted twisting his fingers and looking down at his boots
There was a silence
But she exclaimed I thought you said youd wait another year
Yes I did say so he replied stubbornly
Again she considered
And you know she said Annies a bit of a spendthrift
Shes saved no more than eleven pounds
And I know lad you havent had much chance
He coloured up to the ears
Ive got thirtythree quid he said
It doesnt go far she answered
He said nothing but twisted his fingers
And you know she said Ive nothing I didnt want ma
he cried very red suffering and remonstrating
No my lad I know
I was only wishing I had
And take away five pounds for the wedding and thingsit leaves twentynine pounds
You wont do much on that
He twisted still impotent stubborn not looking up
But do you really want to get married
she asked
Do you feel as if you ought
He gave her one straight look from his blue eyes
Yes he said
Then she replied we must all do the best we can for it lad
The next time he looked up there were tears in his eyes
I dont want Annie to feel handicapped he said struggling
My lad she said youre steadyyouve got a decent place
If a man had NEEDED me Id have married him on his last weeks wages
She may find it a bit hard to start humbly
Young girls ARE like that
They look forward to the fine home they think theyll have
But I had expensive furniture
Its not everything
So the wedding took place almost immediately
Arthur came home and was splendid in uniform
Annie looked nice in a dovegrey dress that she could take for Sundays
Morel called her a fool for getting married and was cool with his soninlaw
Mrs Morel had white tips in her bonnet and some white on her blouse and was teased by both her sons for fancying herself so grand
Leonard was jolly and cordial and felt a fearful fool
Paul could not quite see what Annie wanted to get married for
He was fond of her and she of him
Still he hoped rather lugubriously that it would turn out all right
Arthur was astonishingly handsome in his scarlet and yellow and he knew it well but was secretly ashamed of the uniform
Annie cried her eyes up in the kitchen on leaving her mother
Mrs Morel cried a little then patted her on the back and said But dont cry child hell be good to you
Morel stamped and said she was a fool to go and tie herself up
Leonard looked white and overwrought
Mrs Morel said to him I sll trust her to you my lad and hold you responsible for her
You can he said nearly dead with the ordeal
And it was all over
When Morel and Arthur were in bed Paul sat talking as he often did with his mother
Youre not sorry shes married mother are you
he asked
Im not sorry shes marriedbutit seems strange that she should go from me
It even seems to me hard that she can prefer to go with her Leonard
Thats how mothers areI know its silly
And shall you be miserable about her
When I think of my own wedding day his mother answered I can only hope her life will be different
But you can trust him to be good to her
Yes yes
They say hes not good enough for her
But I say if a man is GENUINE as he is and a girl is fond of himthenit should be all right
Hes as good as she
So you dont mind
I would NEVER have let a daughter of mine marry a man I didnt FEEL to be genuine through and through
And yet theres a gap now shes gone
They were both miserable and wanted her back again
It seemed to Paul his mother looked lonely in her new black silk blouse with its bit of white trimming
At any rate mother I sll never marry he said
Ay they all say that my lad
Youve not met the one yet
Only wait a year or two
But I shant marry mother
I shall live with you and well have a servant
Ay my lad its easy to talk
Well see when the time comes
What time
Im nearly twentythree
Yes youre not one that would marry young
But in three years time I shall be with you just the same
Well see my boy well see
But you dont want me to marry
I shouldnt like to think of you going through your life without anybody to care for you and dono
And you think I ought to marry
Sooner or later every man ought
But youd rather it were later
It would be hardand very hard
Its as they say A sons my son till he takes him a wife But my daughters my daughter the whole of her life
And you think Id let a wife take me from you
Well you wouldnt ask her to marry your mother as well as you Mrs Morel smiled
She could do what she liked she wouldnt have to interfere
She wouldnttill shed got youand then youd see
I never will see
Ill never marry while Ive got youI wont
But I shouldnt like to leave you with nobody my boy she cried
Youre not going to leave me
What are you
Fiftythree
Ill give you till seventyfive
There you are Im fat and fortyfour
Then Ill marry a staid body
See
His mother sat and laughed
Go to bed she saidgo to bed
And well have a pretty house you and me and a servant and itll be just all right
I sll perhaps be rich with my painting
Will you go to bed
And then you sll have a ponycarriage
See yourselfa little Queen Victoria trotting round
I tell you to go to bed she laughed
He kissed her and went
His plans for the future were always the same
Mrs Morel sat broodingabout her daughter about Paul about Arthur
She fretted at losing Annie
The family was very closely bound
And she felt she MUST live now to be with her children
Life was so rich for her
Paul wanted her and so did Arthur
Arthur never knew how deeply he loved her
He was a creature of the moment
Never yet had he been forced to realise himself
The army had disciplined his body but not his soul
He was in perfect health and very handsome
His dark vigorous hair sat close to his smallish head
There was something childish about his nose something almost girlish about his dark blue eyes
But he had the fun red mouth of a man under his brown moustache and his jaw was strong
It was his fathers mouth it was the nose and eyes of her own mothers peoplegoodlooking weakprincipled folk
Mrs Morel was anxious about him
Once he had really run the rig he was safe
But how far would he go
The army had not really done him any good
He resented bitterly the authority of the officers
He hated having to obey as if he were an animal
But he had too much sense to kick
So he turned his attention to getting the best out of it
He could sing he was a booncompanion
Often he got into scrapes but they were the manly scrapes that are easily condoned
So he made a good time out of it whilst his selfrespect was in suppression
He trusted to his good looks and handsome figure his refinement his decent education to get him most of what he wanted and he was not disappointed
Yet he was restless
Something seemed to gnaw him inside
He was never still he was never alone
With his mother he was rather humble
Paul he admired and loved and despised slightly
And Paul admired and loved and despised him slightly
Mrs Morel had had a few pounds left to her by her father and she decided to buy her son out of the army
He was wild with joy
Now he was like a lad taking a holiday
He had always been fond of Beatrice Wyld and during his furlough he picked up with her again
She was stronger and better in health
The two often went long walks together Arthur taking her arm in soldiers fashion rather stiffly
And she came to play the piano whilst he sang
Then Arthur would unhook his tunic collar
He grew flushed his eyes were bright he sang in a manly tenor
Afterwards they sat together on the sofa
He seemed to flaunt his body she was aware of him sothe strong chest the sides the thighs in their closefitting trousers
He liked to lapse into the dialect when he talked to her
She would sometimes smoke with him
Occasionally she would only take a few whiffs at his cigarette
Nay he said to her one evening when she reached for his cigarette
Nay tha doesna
Ill gie thee a smoke kiss if ters a mind
I wanted a whiff no kiss at all she answered
Well an tha slt hae a whiff he said along wi t kiss
I want a draw at thy fag she cried snatching for the cigarette between his lips
He was sitting with his shoulder touching her
She was small and quick as lightning
He just escaped
Ill gie thee a smoke kiss he said
Thart a knivey nuisance Arty Morel she said sitting back
Hae a smoke kiss
The soldier leaned forward to her smiling
His face was near hers
Shonna
she replied turning away her head
He took a draw at his cigarette and pursed up his mouth and put his lips close to her
His darkbrown cropped moustache stood out like a brush
She looked at the puckered crimson lips then suddenly snatched the cigarette from his fingers and darted away
He leaping after her seized the comb from her back hair
She turned threw the cigarette at him
He picked it up put it in his mouth and sat down
Nuisance
she cried
Give me my comb
She was afraid that her hair specially done for him would come down
She stood with her hands to her head
He hid the comb between his knees
Ive non got it he said
The cigarette trembled between his lips with laughter as he spoke
Liar
she said
S true as Im here
he laughed showing his hands
You brazen imp
she exclaimed rushing and scuffling for the comb which he had under his knees
As she wrestled with him pulling at his smooth tightcovered knees he laughed till he lay back on the sofa shaking with laughter
The cigarette fell from his mouth almost singeing his throat
Under his delicate tan the blood flushed up and he laughed till his blue eyes were blinded his throat swollen almost to choking
Then he sat up
Beatrice was putting in her comb
Tha tickled me Beat he said thickly
Like a flash her small white hand went out and smacked his face
He started up glaring at her
They stared at each other
Slowly the flush mounted her cheek she dropped her eyes then her head
He sat down sulkily
She went into the scullery to adjust her hair
In private there she shed a few tears she did not know what for
When she returned she was pursed up close
But it was only a film over her fire
He with ruffled hair was sulking upon the sofa
She sat down opposite in the armchair and neither spoke
The clock ticked in the silence like blows
You are a little cat Beat he said at length half apologetically
Well you shouldnt be brazen she replied
There was again a long silence
He whistled to himself like a man much agitated but defiant
Suddenly she went across to him and kissed him
Did it pore fing
she mocked
He lifted his face smiling curiously
Kiss
he invited her
Darent I
she asked
Go on
he challenged his mouth lifted to her
Deliberately and with a peculiar quivering smile that seemed to overspread her whole body she put her mouth on his
Immediately his arms folded round her
As soon as the long kiss was finished she drew back her head from him put her delicate fingers on his neck through the open collar
Then she closed her eyes giving herself up again in a kiss
She acted of her own free will
What she would do she did and made nobody responsible
Paul felt life changing around him
The conditions of youth were gone
Now it was a home of grownup people
Annie was a married woman Arthur was following his own pleasure in a way unknown to his folk
For so long they had all lived at home and gone out to pass their time
But now for Annie and Arthur life lay outside their mothers house
They came home for holiday and for rest
So there was that strange halfempty feeling about the house as if the birds had flown
Paul became more and more unsettled
Annie and Arthur had gone
He was restless to follow
Yet home was for him beside his mother
And still there was something else something outside something he wanted
He grew more and more restless
Miriam did not satisfy him
His old mad desire to be with her grew weaker
Sometimes he met Clara in Nottingham sometimes he went to meetings with her sometimes he saw her at Willey Farm
But on these last occasions the situation became strained
There was a triangle of antagonism between Paul and Clara and Miriam
With Clara he took on a smart worldly mocking tone very antagonistic to Miriam
It did not matter what went before
She might be intimate and sad with him
Then as soon as Clara appeared it all vanished and he played to the newcomer
Miriam had one beautiful evening with him in the hay
He had been on the horserake and having finished came to help her to put the hay in cocks
Then he talked to her of his hopes and despairs and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her
She felt as if she watched the very quivering stuff of life in him
The moon came out they walked home together he seemed to have come to her because he needed her so badly and she listened to him gave him all her love and her faith
It seemed to her he brought her the best of himself to keep and that she would guard it all her life
Nay the sky did not cherish the stars more surely and eternally than she would guard the good in the soul of Paul Morel
She went on home alone feeling exalted glad in her faith
And then the next day Clara came
They were to have tea in the hayfield
Miriam watched the evening drawing to gold and shadow
And all the time Paul was sporting with Clara
He made higher and higher heaps of hay that they were jumping over
Miriam did not care for the game and stood aside
Edgar and Geoffrey and Maurice and Clara and Paul jumped
Paul won because he was light
Claras blood was roused
She could run like an Amazon
Paul loved the determined way she rushed at the haycock and leaped landed on the other side her breasts shaken her thick hair come undone
You touched
he cried
You touched
No
she flashed turning to Edgar
I didnt touch did I
Wasnt I clear
I couldnt say laughed Edgar
None of them could say
But you touched said Paul
Youre beaten
I did NOT touch
she cried
As plain as anything said Paul
Box his ears for me
she cried to Edgar
Nay Edgar laughed
I darent
You must do it yourself
And nothing can alter the fact that you touched laughed Paul
She was furious with him
Her little triumph before these lads and men was gone
She had forgotten herself in the game
Now he was to humble her
I think you are despicable
she said
And again he laughed in a way that tortured Miriam
And I KNEW you couldnt jump that heap he teased
She turned her back on him
Yet everybody could see that the only person she listened to or was conscious of was he and he of her
It pleased the men to see this battle between them
But Miriam was tortured
Paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher she saw
He could be unfaithful to himself unfaithful to the real deep Paul Morel
There was a danger of his becoming frivolous of his running after his satisfaction like any Arthur or like his father
It made Miriam bitter to think that he should throw away his soul for this flippant traffic of triviality with Clara
She walked in bitterness and silence while the other two rallied each other and Paul sported
And afterwards he would not own it but he was rather ashamed of himself and prostrated himself before Miriam
Then again he rebelled
Its not religious to be religious he said
I reckon a crow is religious when it sails across the sky
But it only does it because it feels itself carried to where its going not because it thinks it is being eternal
But Miriam knew that one should be religious in everything have God whatever God might be present in everything
I dont believe God knows such a lot about Himself he cried
God doesnt KNOW things He IS things
And Im sure Hes not soulful
And then it seemed to her that Paul was arguing God on to his own side because he wanted his own way and his own pleasure
There was a long battle between him and her
He was utterly unfaithful to her even in her own presence then he was ashamed then repentant then he hated her and went off again
Those were the everrecurring conditions
She fretted him to the bottom of his soul
There she remainedsad pensive a worshipper
And he caused her sorrow
Half the time he grieved for her half the time he hated her
She was his conscience and he felt somehow he had got a conscience that was too much for him
He could not leave her because in one way she did hold the best of him
He could not stay with her because she did not take the rest of him which was threequarters
So he chafed himself into rawness over her
When she was twentyone he wrote her a letter which could only have been written to her
May I speak of our old worn love this last time
It too is changing is it not
Say has not the body of that love died and left you its invulnerable soul
You see I can give you a spirit love I have given it you this long long time but not embodied passion
See you are a nun
I have given you what I would give a holy nunas a mystic monk to a mystic nun
Surely you esteem it best
Yet you regretno have regrettedthe other
In all our relations no body enters
I do not talk to you through the sensesrather through the spirit
That is why we cannot love in the common sense
Ours is not an everyday affection
As yet we are mortal and to live side by side with one another would be dreadful for somehow with you I cannot long be trivial and you know to be always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it
If people marry they must live together as affectionate humans who may be commonplace with each other without feeling awkwardnot as two souls
So I feel it
Ought I to send this letterI doubt it
But thereit is best to understand
Au revoir
Miriam read this letter twice after which she sealed it up
A year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter
You are a nunyou are a nun
The words went into her heart again and again
Nothing he ever had said had gone into her so deeply fixedly like a mortal wound
She answered him two days after the party
Our intimacy would have been allbeautiful but for one little mistake she quoted
Was the mistake mine
Almost immediately he replied to her from Nottingham sending her at the same time a little Omar Khayyam
I am glad you answered you are so calm and natural you put me to shame
What a ranter I am
We are often out of sympathy
But in fundamentals we may always be together I think
I must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and drawing
Many a sketch is dedicated to you
I do look forward to your criticisms which to my shame and glory are always grand appreciations
It is a lovely joke that
Au revoir
This was the end of the first phase of Pauls love affair
He was now about twentythree years old and though still virgin the sex instinct that Miriam had overrefined for so long now grew particularly strong
Often as he talked to Clara Dawes came that thickening and quickening of his blood that peculiar concentration in the breast as if something were alive there a new self or a new centre of consciousness warning him that sooner or later he would have to ask one woman or another
But he belonged to Miriam
Of that she was so fixedly sure that he allowed her right
CHAPTER X CLARA WHEN he was twentythree years old Paul sent in a landscape to the winter exhibition at Nottingham Castle
Miss Jordan had taken a good deal of interest in him and invited him to her house where he met other artists
He was beginning to grow ambitious
One morning the postman came just as he was washing in the scullery
Suddenly he heard a wild noise from his mother
Rushing into the kitchen he found her standing on the hearthrug wildly waving a letter and crying Hurrah
as if she had gone mad
He was shocked and frightened
Why mother
he exclaimed
She flew to him flung her arms round him for a moment then waved the letter crying Hurrah my boy
I knew we should do it
He was afraid of herthe small severe woman with graying hair suddenly bursting out in such frenzy
The postman came running back afraid something had happened
They saw his tipped cap over the short curtains
Mrs Morel rushed to the door
His pictures got first prize Fred she cried and is sold for twenty guineas
My word thats something like
said the young postman whom they had known all his life
And Major Moreton has bought it
she cried
It looks like meanin something that does Mrs Morel said the postman his blue eyes bright
He was glad to have brought such a lucky letter
Mrs Morel went indoors and sat down trembling
Paul was afraid lest she might have misread the letter and might be disappointed after all
He scrutinised it once twice
Yes he became convinced it was true
Then he sat down his heart beating with joy
Mother
he exclaimed
Didnt I SAY we should do it
she said pretending she was not crying
He took the kettle off the fire and mashed the tea
You didnt think mother he began tentatively
No my sonnot so muchbut I expected a good deal
But not so much he said
Nonobut I knew we should do it
And then she recovered her composure apparently at least
He sat with his shirt turned back showing his young throat almost like a girls and the towel in his hand his hair sticking up wet
Twenty guineas mother
Thats just what you wanted to buy Arthur out
Now you neednt borrow any
Itll just do
Indeed I shant take it all she said
But why
Because I shant
Wellyou have twelve pounds Ill have nine
They cavilled about sharing the twenty guineas
She wanted to take only the five pounds she needed
He would not hear of it
So they got over the stress of emotion by quarrelling
Morel came home at night from the pit saying They tell me Pauls got first prize for his picture and sold it to Lord Henry Bentley for fifty pound
Oh what stories people do tell
she cried
Ha
he answered
I said I wor sure it wor a lie
But they said thad told Fred Hodgkisson
As if I would tell him such stuff
Ha
assented the miner
But he was disappointed nevertheless
Its true he has got the first prize said Mrs Morel
The miner sat heavily in his chair
Has he beguy
he exclaimed
He stared across the room fixedly
But as for fifty poundssuch nonsense
She was silent awhile
Major Moreton bought it for twenty guineas thats true
Twenty guineas
Tha niver says
exclaimed Morel
Yes and it was worth it
Ay
he said
I dont misdoubt it
But twenty guineas for a bit of a paintin as he knocked off in an hour or two
He was silent with conceit of his son
Mrs Morel sniffed as if it were nothing
And when does he handle th money
asked the collier
That I couldnt tell you
When the picture is sent home I suppose
There was silence
Morel stared at the sugarbasin instead of eating his dinner
His black arm with the hand all gnarled with work lay on the table
His wife pretended not to see him rub the back of his hand across his eyes nor the smear in the coaldust on his black face
Yes an that other lad ud a done as much if they hadna ha killed im he said quietly
The thought of William went through Mrs Morel like a cold blade
It left her feeling she was tired and wanted rest
Paul was invited to dinner at Mr Jordans
Afterwards he said Mother I want an evening suit
Yes I was afraid you would she said
She was glad
There was a moment or two of silence
Theres that one of Williams she continued that I know cost four pounds ten and which hed only worn three times
Should you like me to wear it mother
he asked
Yes
I think it would fit youat least the coat
The trousers would want shortening
He went upstairs and put on the coat and vest
Coming down he looked strange in a flannel collar and a flannel shirtfront with an evening coat and vest
It was rather large
The tailor can make it right she said smoothing her hand over his shoulder
Its beautiful stuff
I never could find in my heart to let your father wear the trousers and very glad I am now
And as she smoothed her hand over the silk collar she thought of her eldest son
But this son was living enough inside the clothes
She passed her hand down his back to feel him
He was alive and hers
The other was dead
He went out to dinner several times in his evening suit that had been Williams
Each time his mothers heart was firm with pride and joy
He was started now
The studs she and the children had bought for William were in his shirtfront he wore one of Williams dress shirts
But he had an elegant figure
His face was rough but warmlooking and rather pleasing
He did not look particularly a gentleman but she thought he looked quite a man
He told her everything that took place everything that was said
It was as if she had been there
And he was dying to introduce her to these new friends who had dinner at seventhirty in the evening
Go along with you
she said
What do they want to know me for
They do
he cried indignantly
If they want to know meand they say they dothen they want to know you because you are quite as clever as I am 
Go along with you child 
she laughed
But she began to spare her hands
They too were workgnarled now
The skin was shiny with so much hot water the knuckles rather swollen
But she began to be careful to keep them out of soda
She regretted what they had beenso small and exquisite
And when Annie insisted on her having more stylish blouses to suit her age she submitted
She even went so far as to allow a black velvet bow to be placed on her hair
Then she sniffed in her sarcastic manner and was sure she looked a sight
But she looked a lady Paul declared as much as Mrs Major Moreton and far far nicer
The family was coming on
Only Morel remained unchanged or rather lapsed slowly
Paul and his mother now had long discussions about life
Religion was fading into the background
He had shovelled away an the beliefs that would hamper him had cleared the ground and come more or less to the bedrock of belief that one should feel inside oneself for right and wrong and should have the patience to gradually realise ones God
Now life interested him more
You know he said to his mother I dont want to belong to the welltodo middle class
I like my common people best
I belong to the common people
But if anyone else said so my son wouldnt you be in a tear
YOU know you consider yourself equal to any gentleman
In myself he answered not in my class or my education or my manners
But in myself I am
Very well then
Then why talk about the common people
Becausethe difference between people isnt in their class but in themselves
Only from the middle classes one gets ideas and from the common peoplelife itself warmth
You feel their hates and loves
Its all very well my boy
But then why dont you go and talk to your fathers pals
But theyre rather different
Not at all
Theyre the common people
After all whom do you mix with nowamong the common people
Those that exchange ideas like the middle classes
The rest dont interest you
Buttheres the life I dont believe theres a jot more life from Miriam than you could get from any educated girlsay Miss Moreton
It is YOU who are snobbish about class
She frankly WANTED him to climb into the middle classes a thing not very difficult she knew
And she wanted him in the end to marry a lady
Now she began to combat him in his restless fretting
He still kept up his connection with Miriam could neither break free nor go the whole length of engagement
And this indecision seemed to bleed him of his energy
Moreover his mother suspected him of an unrecognised leaning towards Clara and since the latter was a married woman she wished he would fall in love with one of the girls in a better station of life
But he was stupid and would refuse to love or even to admire a girl much just because she was his social superior
My boy said his mother to him all your cleverness your breaking away from old things and taking life in your own hands doesnt seem to bring you much happiness
What is happiness
he cried
Its nothing to me
How AM I to be happy
The plump question disturbed her
Thats for you to judge my lad
But if you could meet some GOOD woman who would MAKE you happyand you began to think of settling your lifewhen you have the meansso that you could work without all this frettingit would be much better for you
He frowned
His mother caught him on the raw of his wound of Miriam
He pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead his eyes full of pain and fire
You mean easy mother he cried
Thats a womans whole doctrine for lifeease of soul and physical comfort
And I do despise it
Oh do you
replied his mother
And do you call yours a divine discontent
Yes
I dont care about its divinity
But damn your happiness
So long as lifes full it doesnt matter whether its happy or not
Im afraid your happiness would bore me
You never give it a chance she said
Then suddenly all her passion of grief over him broke out
But it does matter
she cried
And you OUGHT to be happy you ought to try to be happy to live to be happy
How could I bear to think your life wouldnt be a happy one
Your owns been bad enough mater but it hasnt left you so much worse off than the folk whove been happier
I reckon youve done well
And I am the same
Arent I well enough off
Youre not my son
Battlebattleand suffer
Its about all you do as far as I can see
But why not my dear
I tell you its the best It isnt
And one OUGHT to be happy one OUGHT
By this time Mrs Morel was trembling violently
Struggles of this kind often took place between her and her son when she seemed to fight for his very life against his own will to die
He took her in his arms
She was ill and pitiful
Never mind Little he murmured
So long as you dont feel lifes paltry and a miserable business the rest doesnt matter happiness or unhappiness
She pressed him to her
But I want you to be happy she said pathetically
Eh my dearsay rather you want me to live
Mrs Morel felt as if her heart would break for him
At this rate she knew he would not live
He had that poignant carelessness about himself his own suffering his own life which is a form of slow suicide
It almost broke her heart
With all the passion of her strong nature she hated Miriam for having in this subtle way undermined his joy
It did not matter to her that Miriam could not help it
Miriam did it and she hated her
She wished so much he would fall in love with a girl equal to be his mateeducated and strong
But he would not look at anybody above him in station
He seemed to like Mrs Dawes
At any rate that feeling was wholesome
His mother prayed and prayed for him that he might not be wasted
That was all her prayernot for his soul or his righteousness but that he might not be wasted
And while he slept for hours and hours she thought and prayed for him
He drifted away from Miriam imperceptibly without knowing he was going
Arthur only left the army to be married
The baby was born six months after his wedding
Mrs Morel got him a job under the firm again at twentyone shillings a week
She furnished for him with the help of Beatrices mother a little cottage of two rooms
He was caught now
It did not matter how he kicked and struggled he was fast
For a time he chafed was irritable with his young wife who loved him he went almost distracted when the baby which was delicate cried or gave trouble
He grumbled for hours to his mother
She only said Well my lad you did it yourself now you must make the best of it
And then the grit came out in him
He buckled to work undertook his responsibilities acknowledged that he belonged to his wife and child and did make a good best of it
He had never been very closely inbound into the family
Now he was gone altogether
The months went slowly along
Paul had more or less got into connection with the Socialist Suffragette Unitarian people in Nottingham owing to his acquaintance with Clara
One day a friend of his and of Claras in Bestwood asked him to take a message to Mrs Dawes
He went in the evening across Sneinton Market to Bluebell Hill
He found the house in a mean little street paved with granite cobbles and having causeways of dark blue grooved bricks
The front door went up a step from off this rough pavement where the feet of the passersby rasped and clattered
The brown paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed between the rents
He stood on the street below and knocked
There came a heavy footstep a large stout woman of about sixty towered above him
He looked up at her from the pavement
She had a rather severe face
She admitted him into the parlour which opened on to the street
It was a small stuffy defunct room of mahogany and deathly enlargements of photographs of departed people done in carbon
Mrs Radford left him
She was stately almost martial
In a moment Clara appeared
She flushed deeply and he was covered with confusion
It seemed as if she did not like being discovered in her home circumstances
I thought it couldnt be your voice she said
But she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb
She invited him out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen
That was a little darkish room too but it was smothered in white lace
The mother had seated herself again by the cupboard and was drawing thread from a vast web of lace
A clump of fluff and ravelled cotton was at her right hand a heap of threequarterinch lace lay on her left whilst in front of her was the mountain of lace web piling the hearthrug
Threads of curly cotton pulled out from between the lengths of lace strewed over the fender and the fireplace
Paul dared not go forward for fear of treading on piles of white stuff
On the table was a jenny for carding the lace
There was a pack of brown cardboard squares a pack of cards of lace a little box of pins and on the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace
The room was all lace and it was so dark and warm that the white snowy stuff seemed the more distinct
If youre coming in you wont have to mind the work said Mrs Radford
I know were about blocked up
But sit you down
Clara much embarrassed gave him a chair against the wall opposite the white heaps
Then she herself took her place on the sofa shamedly
Will you drink a bottle of stout
Mrs Radford asked
Clara get him a bottle of stout
He protested but Mrs Radford insisted
You look as if you could do with it she said
Havent you never any more colour than that
Its only a thick skin Ive got that doesnt show the blood through he answered
Clara ashamed and chagrined brought him a bottle of stout and a glass
He poured out some of the black stuff
Well he said lifting the glass heres health
And thank you said Mrs Radford
He took a drink of stout
And light yourself a cigarette so long as you dont set the house on fire said Mrs Radford
Thank you he replied
Nay you neednt thank me she answered
I sll be glad to smell a bit of smoke in th ouse again
A house o women is as dead as a house wi no fire to my thinkin
Im not a spider as likes a corner to myself
I like a man about if hes only something to snap at
Clara began to work
Her jenny spun with a subdued buzz the white lace hopped from between her fingers on to the card
It was filled she snipped off the length and pinned the end down to the banded lace
Then she put a new card in her jenny
Paul watched her
She sat square and magnificent
Her throat and arms were bare
The blood still mantled below her ears she bent her head in shame of her humility
Her face was set on her work
Her arms were creamy and full of life beside the white lace her large wellkept hands worked with a balanced movement as if nothing would hurry them
He not knowing watched her all the time
He saw the arch of her neck from the shoulder as she bent her head he saw the coil of dun hair he watched her moving gleaming arms
Ive heard a bit about you from Clara continued the mother
Youre in Jordans arent you
She drew her lace unceasing
Yes
Ay well and I can remember when Thomas Jordan used to ask ME for one of my toffies
Did he
laughed Paul
And did he get it
Sometimes he did sometimes he didntwhich was latterly
For hes the sort that takes all and gives naught he isor used to be
I think hes very decent said Paul
Yes well Im glad to hear it
Mrs Radford looked across at him steadily
There was something determined about her that he liked
Her face was falling loose but her eyes were calm and there was something strong in her that made it seem she was not old merely her wrinkles and loose cheeks were an anachronism
She had the strength and sangfroid of a woman in the prime of life
She continued drawing the lace with slow dignified movements
The big web came up inevitably over her apron the length of lace fell away at her side
Her arms were finely shapen but glossy and yellow as old ivory
They had not the peculiar dull gleam that made Claras so fascinating to him
And youve been going with Miriam Leivers
the mother asked him
Well he answered
Yes shes a nice girl she continued
Shes very nice but shes a bit too much above this world to suit my fancy
She is a bit like that he agreed
Shell never be satisfied till shes got wings and can fly over everybodys head she wont she said
Clara broke in and he told her his message
She spoke humbly to him
He had surprised her in her drudgery
To have her humble made him feel as if he were lifting his head in expectation
Do you like jennying
he asked
What can a woman do
she replied bitterly
Is it sweated
More or less
Isnt ALL womans work
Thats another trick the men have played since we force ourselves into the labour market
Now then you shut up about the men said her mother
If the women wasnt fools the men wouldnt be bad uns thats what I say
No man was ever that bad wi me but what he got it back again
Not but what theyre a lousy lot theres no denying it
But theyre all right really arent they
he asked
Well theyre a bit different from women she answered
Would you care to be back at Jordans
he asked Clara
I dont think so she replied
Yes she would
cried her mother thank her stars if she could get back
Dont you listen to her
Shes for ever on that igh horse of hers an its backs that thin an starved itll cut her in two one of these days
Clara suffered badly from her mother
Paul felt as if his eyes were coming very wide open
Wasnt he to take Claras fulminations so seriously after all
She spun steadily at her work
He experienced a thrill of joy thinking she might need his help
She seemed denied and deprived of so much
And her arm moved mechanically that should never have been subdued to a mechanism and her head was bowed to the lace that never should have been bowed
She seemed to be stranded there among the refuse that life has thrown away doing her jennying
It was a bitter thing to her to be put aside by life as if it had no use for her
No wonder she protested
She came with him to the door
He stood below in the mean street looking up at her
So fine she was in her stature and her bearing she reminded him of Juno dethroned
As she stood in the doorway she winced from the street from her surroundings
And you will go with Mrs Hodgkisson to Hucknall
He was talking quite meaninglessly only watching her
Her grey eyes at last met his
They looked dumb with humiliation pleading with a kind of captive misery
He was shaken and at a loss
He had thought her high and mighty
When he left her he wanted to run
He went to the station in a sort of dream and was at home without realising he had moved out of her street
He had an idea that Susan the overseer of the Spiral girls was about to be married
He asked her the next day
I say Susan I heard a whisper of your getting married
What about it
Susan flushed red
Whos been talking to you
she replied
Nobody
I merely heard a whisper that you WERE thinking Well I am though you neednt tell anybody
Whats more I wish I wasnt
Nay Susan you wont make me believe that
Shant I
You CAN believe it though
Id rather stop here a thousand times
Paul was perturbed
Why Susan
The girls colour was high and her eyes flashed
Thats why
And must you
For answer she looked at him
There was about him a candour and gentleness which made the women trust him
He understood
Ah Im sorry he said
Tears came to her eyes
But youll see itll turn out all right
Youll make the best of it he continued rather wistfully
Theres nothing else for it
Yea theres making the worst of it
Try and make it all right
He soon made occasion to call again on Clara
Would you he said care to come back to Jordans
She put down her work laid her beautiful arms on the table and looked at him for some moments without answering
Gradually the flush mounted her cheek
Why
she asked
Paul felt rather awkward
Well because Susan is thinking of leaving he said
Clara went on with her jennying
The white lace leaped in little jumps and bounds on to the card
He waited for her
Without raising her head she said at last in a peculiar low voice Have you said anything about it
Except to you not a word
There was again a long silence
I will apply when the advertisement is out she said
You will apply before that
I will let you know exactly when
She went on spinning her little machine and did not contradict him
Clara came to Jordans
Some of the older hands Fanny among them remembered her earlier rule and cordially disliked the memory
Clara had always been ikey reserved and superior
She had never mixed with the girls as one of themselves
If she had occasion to find fault she did it coolly and with perfect politeness which the defaulter felt to be a bigger insult than crassness
Towards Fanny the poor overstrung hunchback Clara was unfailingly compassionate and gentle as a result of which Fanny shed more bitter tears than ever the rough tongues of the other overseers had caused her
There was something in Clara that Paul disliked and much that piqued him
If she were about he always watched her strong throat or her neck upon which the blonde hair grew low and fluffy
There was a fine down almost invisible upon the skin of her face and arms and when once he had perceived it he saw it always
When he was at his work painting in the afternoon she would come and stand near to him perfectly motionless
Then he felt her though she neither spoke nor touched him
Although she stood a yard away he felt as if he were in contact with her
Then he could paint no more
He flung down the brushes and turned to talk to her
Sometimes she praised his work sometimes she was critical and cold
You are affected in that piece she would say and as there was an element of truth in her condemnation his blood boiled with anger
Again What of this
he would ask enthusiastically
Hm
She made a small doubtful sound
It doesnt interest me much
Because you dont understand it he retorted
Then why ask me about it
Because I thought you would understand
She would shrug her shoulders in scorn of his work
She maddened him
He was furious
Then he abused her and went into passionate exposition of his stuff
This amused and stimulated her
But she never owned that she had been wrong
During the ten years that she had belonged to the womens movement she had acquired a fair amount of education and having had some of Miriams passion to be instructed had taught herself French and could read in that language with a struggle
She considered herself as a woman apart and particularly apart from her class
The girls in the Spiral department were all of good homes
It was a small special industry and had a certain distinction
There was an air of refinement in both rooms
But Clara was aloof also from her fellowworkers
None of these things however did she reveal to Paul
She was not the one to give herself away
There was a sense of mystery about her
She was so reserved he felt she had much to reserve
Her history was open on the surface but its inner meaning was hidden from everybody
It was exciting
And then sometimes he caught her looking at him from under her brows with an almost furtive sullen scrutiny which made him move quickly
Often she met his eyes
But then her own were as it were covered over revealing nothing
She gave him a little lenient smile
She was to him extraordinarily provocative because of the knowledge she seemed to possess and gathered fruit of experience he could not attain
One day he picked up a copy of Lettres de mon Moulin from her workbench
You read French do you
he cried
Clara glanced round negligently
She was making an elastic stocking of heliotrope silk turning the Spiral machine with slow balanced regularity occasionally bending down to see her work or to adjust the needles then her magnificent neck with its down and fine pencils of hair shone white against the lavender lustrous silk
She turned a few more rounds and stopped
What did you say
she asked smiling sweetly
Pauls eyes glittered at her insolent indifference to him
I did not know you read French he said very polite
Did you not
she replied with a faint sarcastic smile
Rotten swank
he said but scarcely loud enough to be heard
He shut his mouth angrily as he watched her
She seemed to scorn the work she mechanically produced yet the hose she made were as nearly perfect as possible
You dont like Spiral work he said
Oh well all work is work she answered as if she knew all about it
He marvelled at her coldness
He had to do everything hotly
She must be something special
What would you prefer to do
he asked
She laughed at him indulgently as she said There is so little likelihood of my ever being given a choice that I havent wasted time considering
Pah
he said contemptuous on his side now
You only say that because youre too proud to own up what you want and cant get
You know me very well she replied coldly
I know you think youre terrific great shakes and that you live under the eternal insult of working in a factory
He was very angry and very rude
She merely turned away from him in disdain
He walked whistling down the room flirted and laughed with Hilda
Later on he said to himself What was I so impudent to Clara for
He was rather annoyed with himself at the same time glad
Serve her right she stinks with silent pride he said to himself angrily
In the afternoon he came down
There was a certain weight on his heart which he wanted to remove
He thought to do it by offering her chocolates
Have one
he said
I bought a handful to sweeten me up
To his great relief she accepted
He sat on the workbench beside her machine twisting a piece of silk round his finger
She loved him for his quick unexpected movements like a young animal
His feet swung as he pondered
The sweets lay strewn on the bench
She bent over her machine grinding rhythmically then stooping to see the stocking that hung beneath pulled down by the weight
He watched the handsome crouching of her back and the apronstrings curling on the floor
There is always about you he said a sort of waiting
Whatever I see you doing youre not really there you are waitinglike Penelope when she did her weaving
He could not help a spurt of wickedness
Ill call you Penelope he said
Would it make any difference
she said carefully removing one of her needles
That doesnt matter so long as it pleases me
Here I say you seem to forget Im your boss
It just occurs to me
And what does that mean
she asked coolly
It means Ive got a right to boss you
Is there anything you want to complain about
Oh I say you neednt be nasty he said angrily
I dont know what you want she said continuing her task
I want you to treat me nicely and respectfully
Call you sir perhaps
she asked quietly
Yes call me sir
I should love it
Then I wish you would go upstairs sir
His mouth closed and a frown came on his face
He jumped suddenly down
Youre too blessed superior for anything he said
And he went away to the other girls
He felt he was being angrier than he had any need to be
In fact he doubted slightly that he was showing off
But if he were then he would
Clara heard him laughing in a way she hated with the girls down the next room
When at evening he went through the department after the girls had gone he saw his chocolates lying untouched in front of Claras machine
He left them
In the morning they were still there and Clara was at work
Later on Minnie a little brunette they called Pussy called to him Hey havent you got a chocolate for anybody
Sorry Pussy he replied
I meant to have offered them then I went and forgot em
I think you did she answered
Ill bring you some this afternoon
You dont want them after theyve been lying about do you
Oh Im not particular smiled Pussy
Oh no he said
Theyll be dusty
He went up to Claras bench
Sorry I left these things littering about he said
She flushed scarlet
He gathered them together in his fist
Theyll be dirty now he said
You should have taken them
I wonder why you didnt
I meant to have told you I wanted you to
He flung them out of the window into the yard below
He just glanced at her
She winced from his eyes
In the afternoon he brought another packet
Will you take some
he said offering them first to Clara
These are fresh
She accepted one and put it on to the bench
Oh take severalfor luck he said
She took a couple more and put them on the bench also
Then she turned in confusion to her work
He went on up the room
Here you are Pussy he said
Dont be greedy
Are they all for her
cried the others rushing up
Of course theyre not he said
The girls clamoured round
Pussy drew back from her mates
Come out
she cried
I can have first pick cant I Paul
Be nice with em he said and went away
You ARE a dear the girls cried
Tenpence he answered
He went past Clara without speaking
She felt the three chocolate creams would burn her if she touched them
It needed all her courage to slip them into the pocket of her apron
The girls loved him and were afraid of him
He was so nice while he was nice but if he were offended so distant treating them as if they scarcely existed or not more than the bobbins of thread
And then if they were impudent he said quietly Do you mind going on with your work and stood and watched
When he celebrated his twentythird birthday the house was in trouble
Arthur was just going to be married
His mother was not well
His father getting an old man and lame from his accidents was given a paltry poor job
Miriam was an eternal reproach
He felt he owed himself to her yet could not give himself
The house moreover needed his support
He was pulled in all directions
He was not glad it was his birthday
It made him bitter
He got to work at eight oclock
Most of the clerks had not turned up
The girls were not due till 830
As he was changing his coat he heard a voice behind him say Paul Paul I want you
It was Fanny the hunchback standing at the top of her stairs her face radiant with a secret
Paul looked at her in astonishment
I want you she said
He stood at a loss
Come on she coaxed
Come before you begin on the letters
He went down the halfdozen steps into her dry narrow finishingoff room
Fanny walked before him her black bodice was shortthe waist was under her armpitsand her greenblack cashmere skirt seemed very long as she strode with big strides before the young man himself so graceful
She went to her seat at the narrow end of the room where the window opened on to chimneypots
Paul watched her thin hands and her flat red wrists as she excitedly twitched her white apron which was spread on the bench in front of her
She hesitated
You didnt think wed forgot you
she asked reproachful
Why
he asked
He had forgotten his birthday himself
Why he says
Why
Why look here
She pointed to the calendar and he saw surrounding the big black number 21 hundreds of little crosses in blacklead
Oh kisses for my birthday he laughed
How did you know
Yes you want to know dont you
Fanny mocked hugely delighted
Theres one from everybodyexcept Lady Claraand two from some
But I shant tell you how many I put
Oh I know youre spooney he said
There you ARE mistaken
she cried indignant
I could never be so soft
Her voice was strong and contralto
You always pretend to be such a hardhearted hussy he laughed
And you know youre as sentimental Id rather be called sentimental than frozen meat Fanny blurted
Paul knew she referred to Clara and he smiled
Do you say such nasty things about me
he laughed
No my duck the hunchback woman answered lavishly tender
She was thirtynine
No my duck because you dont think yourself a fine figure in marble and us nothing but dirt
Im as good as you arent I Paul
and the question delighted her
Why were not better than one another are we
he replied
But Im as good as you arent I Paul
she persisted daringly
Of course you are
If it comes to goodness youre better
She was rather afraid of the situation
She might get hysterical
I thought Id get here before the otherswont they say Im deep
Now shut your eyes she said
And open your mouth and see what God sends you he continued suiting action to words and expecting a piece of chocolate
He heard the rustle of the apron and a faint clink of metal
Im going to look he said
He opened his eyes
Fanny her long cheeks flushed her blue eyes shining was gazing at him
There was a little bundle of painttubes on the bench before him
He turned pale
No Fanny he said quickly
From us all she answered hastily
No but Are they the right sort
she asked rocking herself with delight
Jove
theyre the best in the catalogue
But theyre the right sorts
she cried
Theyre off the little list Id made to get when my ship came in
He bit his lip
Fanny was overcome with emotion
She must turn the conversation
They was all on thorns to do it they all paid their shares all except the Queen of Sheba
The Queen of Sheba was Clara
And wouldnt she join
Paul asked
She didnt get the chance we never told her we wasnt going to have HER bossing THIS show
We didnt WANT her to join
Paul laughed at the woman
He was much moved
At last he must go
She was very close to him
Suddenly she flung her arms round his neck and kissed him vehemently
I can give you a kiss today she said apologetically
Youve looked so white its made my heart ache
Paul kissed her and left her
Her arms were so pitifully thin that his heart ached also
That day he met Clara as he ran downstairs to wash his hands at dinnertime
You have stayed to dinner
he exclaimed
It was unusual for her
Yes and I seem to have dined on old surgicalappliance stock
I MUST go out now or I shall feel stale indiarubber right through
She lingered
He instantly caught at her wish
You are going anywhere
he asked
They went together up to the Castle
Outdoors she dressed very plainly down to ugliness indoors she always looked nice
She walked with hesitating steps alongside Paul bowing and turning away from him
Dowdy in dress and drooping she showed to great disadvantage
He could scarcely recognise her strong form that seemed to slumber with power
She appeared almost insignificant drowning her stature in her stoop as she shrank from the public gaze
The Castle grounds were very green and fresh
Climbing the precipitous ascent he laughed and chattered but she was silent seeming to brood over something
There was scarcely time to go inside the squat square building that crowns the bluff of rock
They leaned upon the wall where the cliff runs sheer down to the Park
Below them in their holes in the sandstone pigeons preened themselves and cooed softly
Away down upon the boulevard at the foot of the rock tiny trees stood in their own pools of shadow and tiny people went scurrying about in almost ludicrous importance
You feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles and have a handful of them he said
She laughed answering Yes it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us proportionately
The trees are much more significant
Bulk only he said
She laughed cynically
Away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metals showed upon the railwaytrack whose margin was crowded with little stacks of timber beside which smoking toy engines fussed
Then the silver string of the canal lay at random among the black heaps
Beyond the dwellings very dense on the river flat looked like black poisonous herbage in thick rows and crowded beds stretching right away broken now and then by taller plants right to where the river glistened in a hieroglyph across the country
The steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny
Great stretches of country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with cornland spread towards the haze where the hills rose blue beyond grey
It is comforting said Mrs Dawes to think the town goes no farther
It is only a LITTLE sore upon the country yet
A little scab Paul said
She shivered
She loathed the town
Looking drearily across at the country which was forbidden her her impassive face pale and hostile she reminded Paul of one of the bitter remorseful angels
But the towns all right he said its only temporary
This is the crude clumsy makeshift weve practised on till we find out what the idea is
The town will come all right
The pigeons in the pockets of rock among the perched bushes cooed comfortably
To the left the large church of St Mary rose into space to keep close company with the Castle above the heaped rubble of the town
Mrs Dawes smiled brightly as she looked across the country
I feel better she said
Thank you he replied
Great compliment
Oh my brother
she laughed
Hm
thats snatching back with the left hand what you gave with the right and no mistake he said
She laughed in amusement at him
But what was the matter with you
he asked
I know you were brooding something special
I can see the stamp of it on your face yet
I think I will not tell you she said
All right hug it he answered
She flushed and bit her lip
No she said it was the girls
What about em
Paul asked
They have been plotting something for a week now and today they seem particularly full of it
All alike they insult me with their secrecy
Do they
he asked in concern
I should not mind she went on in the metallic angry tone if they did not thrust it into my facethe fact that they have a secret
Just like women said he
It is hateful their mean gloating she said intensely
Paul was silent
He knew what the girls gloated over
He was sorry to be the cause of this new dissension
They can have all the secrets in the world she went on brooding bitterly but they might refrain from glorying in them and making me feel more out of it than ever
It isit is almost unbearable
Paul thought for a few minutes
He was much perturbed
I will tell you what its all about he said pale and nervous
Its my birthday and theyve bought me a fine lot of paints all the girls
Theyre jealous of youhe felt her stiffen coldly at the word jealousmerely because I sometimes bring you a book he added slowly
But you see its only a trifle
Dont bother about it will youbecausehe laughed quicklywell what would they say if they saw us here now in spite of their victory
She was angry with him for his clumsy reference to their present intimacy
It was almost insolent of him
Yet he was so quiet she forgave him although it cost her an effort
Their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the Castle wall
He had inherited from his mother a fineness of mould so that his hands were small and vigorous
Hers were large to match her large limbs but white and powerful looking
As Paul looked at them he knew her
She is wanting somebody to take her handsfor all she is so contemptuous of us he said to himself
And she saw nothing but his two hands so warm and alive which seemed to live for her
He was brooding now staring out over the country from under sullen brows
The little interesting diversity of shapes had vanished from the scene all that remained was a vast dark matrix of sorrow and tragedy the same in all the houses and the riverflats and the people and the birds they were only shapen differently
And now that the forms seemed to have melted away there remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed a dark mass of struggle and pain
The factory the girls his mother the large uplifted church the thicket of the town merged into one atmospheredark brooding and sorrowful every bit
Is that two oclock striking
Mrs Dawes said in surprise
Paul started and everything sprang into form regained its individuality its forgetfulness and its cheerfulness
They hurried back to work
When he was in the rush of preparing for the nights post examining the work up from Fannys room which smelt of ironing the evening postman came in
Mr
Paul Morel he said smiling handing Paul a package
A ladys handwriting
Dont let the girls see it
The postman himself a favourite was pleased to make fun of the girls affection for Paul
It was a volume of verse with a brief note You will allow me to send you this and so spare me my isolation
I also sympathise and wish you wellCD
Paul flushed hot
Good Lord
Mrs Dawes
She cant afford it
Good Lord who everd have thought it
He was suddenly intensely moved
He was filled with the warmth of her
In the glow he could almost feel her as if she were presenther arms her shoulders her bosom see them feel them almost contain them
This move on the part of Clara brought them into closer intimacy
The other girls noticed that when Paul met Mrs Dawes his eyes lifted and gave that peculiar bright greeting which they could interpret
Knowing he was unaware Clara made no sign save that occasionally she turned aside her face from him when he came upon her
They walked out together very often at dinnertime it was quite open quite frank
Everybody seemed to feel that he was quite unaware of the state of his own feeling and that nothing was wrong
He talked to her now with some of the old fervour with which he had talked to Miriam but he cared less about the talk he did not bother about his conclusions
One day in October they went out to Lambley for tea
Suddenly they came to a halt on top of the hill
He climbed and sat on a gate she sat on the stile
The afternoon was perfectly still with a dim haze and yellow sheaves glowing through
They were quiet
How old were you when you married
he asked quietly
Twentytwo
Her voice was subdued almost submissive
She would tell him now
It is eight years ago
Yes
And when did you leave him
Three years ago
Five years
Did you love him when you married him
She was silent for some time then she said slowly I thought I didmore or less
I didnt think much about it
And he wanted me
I was very prudish then
And you sort of walked into it without thinking
Yes
I seemed to have been asleep nearly all my life
Somnambule
Butwhen did you wake up
I dont know that I ever did or ever havesince I was a child
You went to sleep as you grew to be a woman
How queer
And he didnt wake you
No he never got there she replied in a monotone
The brown birds dashed over the hedges where the rosehips stood naked and scarlet
Got where
he asked
At me
He never really mattered to me
The afternoon was so gently warm and dim
Red roofs of the cottages burned among the blue haze
He loved the day
He could feel but he could not understand what Clara was saying
But why did you leave him
Was he horrid to you
She shuddered lightly
Hehe sort of degraded me
He wanted to bully me because he hadnt got me
And then I felt as if I wanted to run as if I was fastened and bound up
And he seemed dirty
I see
He did not at all see
And was he always dirty
he asked
A bit she replied slowly
And then he seemed as if he couldnt get AT me really
And then he got brutalhe WAS brutal
And why did you leave him finally
Becausebecause he was unfaithful to me They were both silent for some time
Her hand lay on the gatepost as she balanced
He put his own over it
His heart beat quickly
But did youwere you everdid you ever give him a chance
Chance
How
To come near to you
I married himand I was willing They both strove to keep their voices steady
I believe he loves you he said
It looks like it she replied
He wanted to take his hand away and could not
She saved him by removing her own
After a silence he began again Did you leave him out of count all along
He left me she said
And I suppose he couldnt MAKE himself mean everything to you
He tried to bully me into it
But the conversation had got them both out of their depth
Suddenly Paul jumped down
Come on he said
Lets go and get some tea
They found a cottage where they sat in the cold parlour
She poured out his tea
She was very quiet
He felt she had withdrawn again from him
After tea she stared broodingly into her teacup twisting her wedding ring all the time
In her abstraction she took the ring off her finger stood it up and spun it upon the table
The gold became a diaphanous glittering globe
It fell and the ring was quivering upon the table
She spun it again and again
Paul watched fascinated
But she was a married woman and he believed in simple friendship
And he considered that he was perfectly honourable with regard to her
It was only a friendship between man and woman such as any civilised persons might have
He was like so many young men of his own age
Sex had become so complicated in him that he would have denied that he ever could want Clara or Miriam or any woman whom he knew
Sex desire was a sort of detached thing that did not belong to a woman
He loved Miriam with his soul
He grew warm at the thought of Clara he battled with her he knew the curves of her breast and shoulders as if they had been moulded inside him and yet he did not positively desire her
He would have denied it for ever
He believed himself really bound to Miriam
If ever he should marry some time in the far future it would be his duty to marry Miriam
That he gave Clara to understand and she said nothing but left him to his courses
He came to her Mrs Dawes whenever he could
Then he wrote frequently to Miriam and visited the girl occasionally
So he went on through the winter but he seemed not so fretted
His mother was easier about him
She thought he was getting away from Miriam
Miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of Clara for him but still she was certain that the best in him would triumph
His feeling for Mrs Daweswho moreover was a married woman was shallow and temporal compared with his love for herself
He would come back to her she was sure with some of his young freshness gone perhaps but cured of his desire for the lesser things which other women than herself could give him
She could bear all if he were inwardly true to her and must come back
He saw none of the anomaly of his position
Miriam was his old friend lover and she belonged to Bestwood and home and his youth
Clara was a newer friend and she belonged to Nottingham to life to the world
It seemed to him quite plain
Mrs Dawes and he had many periods of coolness when they saw little of each other but they always came together again
Were you horrid with Baxter Dawes
he asked her
It was a thing that seemed to trouble him
In what way
Oh I dont know
But werent you horrid with him
Didnt you do something that knocked him to pieces
What pray
Making him feel as if he were nothingI know Paul declared
You are so clever my friend she said coolly
The conversation broke off there
But it made her cool with him for some time
She very rarely saw Miriam now
The friendship between the two women was not broken off but considerably weakened
Will you come in to the concert on Sunday afternoon
Clara asked him just after Christmas
I promised to go up to Willey Farm he replied
Oh very well
You dont mind do you
he asked
Why should I
she answered
Which almost annoyed him
You know he said Miriam and I have been a lot to each other ever since I was sixteenthats seven years now
Its a long time Clara replied
Yes but somehow sheit doesnt go right How
asked Clara
She seems to draw me and draw me and she wouldnt leave a single hair of me free to fall out and blow awayshed keep it
But you like to be kept
No he said I dont
I wish it could be normal give and take like me and you
I want a woman to keep me but not in her pocket
But if you love her it couldnt be normal like me and you
Yes I should love her better then
She sort of wants me so much that I cant give myself
Wants you how
Wants the soul out of my body
I cant help shrinking back from her
And yet you love her
No I dont love her
I never even kiss her
Why not
Clara asked
I dont know
I suppose youre afraid she said
Im not
Something in me shrinks from her like hellshes so good when Im not good
How do you know what she is
I do
I know she wants a sort of soul union
But how do you know what she wants
Ive been with her for seven years
And you havent found out the very first thing about her
Whats that
That she doesnt want any of your soul communion
Thats your own imagination
She wants you
He pondered over this
Perhaps he was wrong
But she seems he began
Youve never tried she answered
CHAPTER XI THE TEST ON MIRIAM WITH the spring came again the old madness and battle
Now he knew he would have to go to Miriam
But what was his reluctance
He told himself it was only a sort of overstrong virginity in her and him which neither could break through
He might have married her but his circumstances at home made it difficult and moreover he did not want to marry
Marriage was for life and because they had become close companions he and she he did not see that it should inevitably follow they should be man and wife
He did not feel that he wanted marriage with Miriam
He wished he did
He would have given his head to have felt a joyous desire to marry her and to have her
Then why couldnt he bring it off
There was some obstacle and what was the obstacle
It lay in the physical bondage
He shrank from the physical contact
But why
With her he felt bound up inside himself
He could not go out to her
Something struggled in him but he could not get to her
Why
She loved him
Clara said she even wanted him then why couldnt he go to her make love to her kiss her
Why when she put her arm in his timidly as they walked did he feel he would burst forth in brutality and recoil
He owed himself to her he wanted to belong to her
Perhaps the recoil and the shrinking from her was love in its first fierce modesty
He had no aversion for her
No it was the opposite it was a strong desire battling with a still stronger shyness and virginity
It seemed as if virginity were a positive force which fought and won in both of them
And with her he felt it so hard to overcome yet he was nearest to her and with her alone could he deliberately break through
And he owed himself to her
Then if they could get things right they could marry but he would not marry unless he could feel strong in the joy of itnever
He could not have faced his mother
It seemed to him that to sacrifice himself in a marriage he did not want would be degrading and would undo all his life make it a nullity
He would try what he COULD do
And he had a great tenderness for Miriam
Always she was sad dreaming her religion and he was nearly a religion to her
He could not bear to fail her
It would all come right if they tried
He looked round
A good many of the nicest men he knew were like himself bound in by their own virginity which they could not break out of
They were so sensitive to their women that they would go without them for ever rather than do them a hurt an injustice
Being the sons of mothers whose husbands had blundered rather brutally through their feminine sanctities they were themselves too diffident and shy
They could easier deny themselves than incur any reproach from a woman for a woman was like their mother and they were full of the sense of their mother
They preferred themselves to suffer the misery of celibacy rather than risk the other person
He went back to her
Something in her when he looked at her brought the tears almost to his eyes
One day he stood behind her as she sang
Annie was playing a song on the piano
As Miriam sang her mouth seemed hopeless
She sang like a nun singing to heaven
It reminded him so much of the mouth and eyes of one who sings beside a Botticelli Madonna so spiritual
Again hot as steel came up the pain in him
Why must he ask her for the other thing
Why was there his blood battling with her
If only he could have been always gentle tender with her breathing with her the atmosphere of reverie and religious dreams he would give his right hand
It was not fair to hurt her
There seemed an eternal maidenhood about her and when he thought of her mother he saw the great brown eyes of a maiden who was nearly scared and shocked out of her virgin maidenhood but not quite in spite of her seven children
They had been born almost leaving her out of count not of her but upon her
So she could never let them go because she never had possessed them
Mrs Morel saw him going again frequently to Miriam and was astonished
He said nothing to his mother
He did not explain nor excuse himself
If he came home late and she reproached him he frowned and turned on her in an overbearing way I shall come home when I like he said I am old enough
Must she keep you till this time
It is I who stay he answered
And she lets you
But very well she said
And she went to bed leaving the door unlocked for him but she lay listening until he came often long after
It was a great bitterness to her that he had gone back to Miriam
She recognised however the uselessness of any further interference
He went to Willey Farm as a man now not as a youth
She had no right over him
There was a coldness between him and her
He hardly told her anything
Discarded she waited on him cooked for him still and loved to slave for him but her face closed again like a mask
There was nothing for her to do now but the housework for all the rest he had gone to Miriam
She could not forgive him
Miriam killed the joy and the warmth in him
He had been such a jolly lad and full of the warmest affection now he grew colder more and more irritable and gloomy
It reminded her of William but Paul was worse
He did things with more intensity and more realisation of what he was about
His mother knew how he was suffering for want of a woman and she saw him going to Miriam
If he had made up his mind nothing on earth would alter him
Mrs Morel was tired
She began to give up at last she had finished
She was in the way
He went on determinedly
He realised more or less what his mother felt
It only hardened his soul
He made himself callous towards her but it was like being callous to his own health
It undermined him quickly yet he persisted
He lay back in the rockingchair at Willey Farm one evening
He had been talking to Miriam for some weeks but had not come to the point
Now he said suddenly I am twentyfour almost
She had been brooding
She looked up at him suddenly in surprise
Yes
What makes you say it
There was something in the charged atmosphere that she dreaded
Sir Thomas More says one can marry at twentyfour
She laughed quaintly saying Does it need Sir Thomas Mores sanction
No but one ought to marry about then
Ay she answered broodingly and she waited
I cant marry you he continued slowly not now because weve no money and they depend on me at home
She sat halfguessing what was coming
But I want to marry now You want to marry
she repeated
A womanyou know what I mean
She was silent
Now at last I must he said
Ay she answered
And you love me
She laughed bitterly
Why are you ashamed of it he answered
You wouldnt be ashamed before your God why are you before people
Nay she answered deeply I am not ashamed
You are he replied bitterly and its my fault
But you know I cant help beingas I amdont you
I know you cant help it she replied
I love you an awful lotthen there is something short
Where
she answered looking at him
Oh in me
It is I who ought to be ashamedlike a spiritual cripple
And I am ashamed
It is misery
Why is it
I dont know replied Miriam
And I dont know he repeated
Dont you think we have been too fierce in our what they call purity
Dont you think that to be so much afraid and averse is a sort of dirtiness
She looked at him with startled dark eyes
You recoiled away from anything of the sort and I took the motion from you and recoiled also perhaps worse
There was silence in the room for some time
Yes she said it is so
There is between us he said all these years of intimacy
I feel naked enough before you
Do you understand
I think so she answered
And you love me
She laughed
Dont be bitter he pleaded
She looked at him and was sorry for him his eyes were dark with torture
She was sorry for him it was worse for him to have this deflated love than for herself who could never be properly mated
He was restless for ever urging forward and trying to find a way out
He might do as he liked and have what he liked of her
Nay she said softly I am not bitter
She felt she could bear anything for him she would suffer for him
She put her hand on his knee as he leaned forward in his chair
He took it and kissed it but it hurt to do so
He felt he was putting himself aside
He sat there sacrificed to her purity which felt more like nullity
How could he kiss her hand passionately when it would drive her away and leave nothing but pain
Yet slowly he drew her to him and kissed her
They knew each other too well to pretend anything
As she kissed him she watched his eyes they were staring across the room with a peculiar dark blaze in them that fascinated her
He was perfectly still
She could feel his heart throbbing heavily in his breast
What are you thinking about
she asked
The blaze in his eyes shuddered became uncertain
I was thinking all the while I love you
I have been obstinate
She sank her head on his breast
Yes she answered
Thats all he said and his voice seemed sure and his mouth was kissing her throat
Then she raised her head and looked into his eyes with her full gaze of love
The blaze struggled seemed to try to get away from her and then was quenched
He turned his head quickly aside
It was a moment of anguish
Kiss me she whispered
He shut his eyes and kissed her and his arms folded her closer and closer
When she walked home with him over the fields he said I am glad I came back to you
I feel so simple with youas if there was nothing to hide
We will be happy
Yes she murmured and the tears came to her eyes
Some sort of perversity in our souls he said makes us not want get away from the very thing we want
We have to fight against that
Yes she said and she felt stunned
As she stood under the droopingthorn tree in the darkness by the roadside he kissed her and his fingers wandered over her face
In the darkness where he could not see her but only feel her his passion flooded him
He clasped her very close
Sometime you will have me
he murmured hiding his face on her shoulder
It was so difficult
Not now she said
His hopes and his heart sunk
A dreariness came over him
No he said
His clasp of her slackened
I love to feel your arm THERE
she said pressing his arm against her back where it went round her waist
It rests me so
He tightened the pressure of his arm upon the small of her back to rest her
We belong to each other he said
Yes
Then why shouldnt we belong to each other altogether
But she faltered
I know its a lot to ask he said but theres not much risk for you reallynot in the Gretchen way
You can trust me there
Oh I can trust you
The answer came quick and strong
Its not thatits not that at allbut What
She hid her face in his neck with a little cry of misery
I dont know
she cried
She seemed slightly hysterical but with a sort of horror
His heart died in him
You dont think it ugly
he asked
No not now
You have TAUGHT me it isnt
You are afraid
She calmed herself hastily
Yes I am only afraid she said
He kissed her tenderly
Never mind he said
You should please yourself
Suddenly she gripped his arms round her and clenched her body stiff
You SHALL have me she said through her shut teeth
His heart beat up again like fire
He folded her close and his mouth was on her throat
She could not bear it
She drew away
He disengaged her
Wont you be late
she asked gently
He sighed scarcely hearing what she said
She waited wishing he would go
At last he kissed her quickly and climbed the fence
Looking round he saw the pale blotch of her face down in the darkness under the hanging tree
There was no more of her but this pale blotch
Goodbye
she called softly
She had no body only a voice and a dim face
He turned away and ran down the road his fists clenched and when he came to the wall over the lake he leaned there almost stunned looking up the black water
Miriam plunged home over the meadows
She was not afraid of people what they might say but she dreaded the issue with him
Yes she would let him have her if he insisted and then when she thought of it afterwards her heart went down
He would be disappointed he would find no satisfaction and then he would go away
Yet he was so insistent and over this which did not seem so allimportant to her was their love to break down
After all he was only like other men seeking his satisfaction
Oh but there was something more in him something deeper
She could trust to it in spite of all desires
He said that possession was a great moment in life
All strong emotions concentrated there
Perhaps it was so
There was something divine in it then she would submit religiously to the sacrifice
He should have her
And at the thought her whole body clenched itself involuntarily hard as if against something but Life forced her through this gate of suffering too and she would submit
At any rate it would give him what he wanted which was her deepest wish
She brooded and brooded and brooded herself towards accepting him
He courted her now like a lover
Often when he grew hot she put his face from her held it between her hands and looked in his eyes
He could not meet her gaze
Her dark eyes full of love earnest and searching made him turn away
Not for an instant would she let him forget
Back again he had to torture himself into a sense of his responsibility and hers
Never any relaxing never any leaving himself to the great hunger and impersonality of passion he must be brought back to a deliberate reflective creature
As if from a swoon of passion she caged him back to the littleness the personal relationship
He could not bear it
Leave me aloneleave me alone
he wanted to cry but she wanted him to look at her with eyes full of love
His eyes full of the dark impersonal fire of desire did not belong to her
There was a great crop of cherries at the farm
The trees at the back of the house very large and tall hung thick with scarlet and crimson drops under the dark leaves
Paul and Edgar were gathering the fruit one evening
It had been a hot day and now the clouds were rolling in the sky dark and warm
Paul combed high in the tree above the scarlet roofs of the buildings
The wind moaning steadily made the whole tree rock with a subtle thrilling motion that stirred the blood
The young man perched insecurely in the slender branches rocked till he felt slightly drunk reached down the boughs where the scarlet beady cherries hung thick underneath and tore off handful after handful of the sleek coolfleshed fruit
Cherries touched his ears and his neck as he stretched forward their chill fingertips sending a flash down his blood
All shades of red from a golden vermilion to a rich crimson glowed and met his eyes under a darkness of leaves
The sun going down suddenly caught the broken clouds
Immense piles of gold flared out in the southeast heaped in soft glowing yellow right up the sky
The world till now dusk and grey reflected the gold glow astonished
Everywhere the trees and the grass and the faroff water seemed roused from the twilight and shining
Miriam came out wondering
Oh
Paul heard her mellow voice call isnt it wonderful
He looked down
There was a faint gold glimmer on her face that looked very soft turned up to him
How high you are
she said
Beside her on the rhubarb leaves were four dead birds thieves that had been shot
Paul saw some cherry stones hanging quite bleached like skeletons picked clear of flesh
He looked down again to Miriam
Clouds are on fire he said
Beautiful
she cried
She seemed so small so soft so tender down there
He threw a handful of cherries at her
She was startled and frightened
He laughed with a low chuckling sound and pelted her
She ran for shelter picking up some cherries
Two fine red pairs she hung over her ears then she looked up again
Havent you got enough
she asked
Nearly
It is like being on a ship up here
And how long will you stay
While the sunset lasts
She went to the fence and sat there watching the gold clouds fall to pieces and go in immense rosecoloured ruin towards the darkness
Gold flamed to scarlet like pain in its intense brightness
Then the scarlet sank to rose and rose to crimson and quickly the passion went out of the sky
All the world was dark grey
Paul scrambled quickly down with his basket tearing his shirtsleeve as he did so
They are lovely said Miriam fingering the cherries
Ive torn my sleeve he answered
She took the threecornered rip saying I shall have to mend it
It was near the shoulder
She put her fingers through the tear
How warm
she said
He laughed
There was a new strange note in his voice one that made her pant
Shall we stay out
he said
Wont it rain
she asked
No let us walk a little way
They went down the fields and into the thick plantation of trees and pines
Shall we go in among the trees
he asked
Do you want to
Yes
It was very dark among the firs and the sharp spines pricked her face
She was afraid
Paul was silent and strange
I like the darkness he said
I wish it were thickergood thick darkness
He seemed to be almost unaware of her as a person she was only to him then a woman
She was afraid
He stood against a pinetree trunk and took her in his arms
She relinquished herself to him but it was a sacrifice in which she felt something of horror
This thickvoiced oblivious man was a stranger to her
Later it began to rain
The pinetrees smelled very strong
Paul lay with his head on the ground on the dead pine needles listening to the sharp hiss of the raina steady keen noise
His heart was down very heavy
Now he realised that she had not been with him all the time that her soul had stood apart in a sort of horror
He was physically at rest but no more
Very dreary at heart very sad and very tender his fingers wandered over her face pitifully
Now again she loved him deeply
He was tender and beautiful
The rain
he said
Yesis it coming on you
She put her hands over him on his hair on his shoulders to feel if the raindrops fell on him
She loved him dearly
He as he lay with his face on the dead pineleaves felt extraordinarily quiet
He did not mind if the raindrops came on him he would have lain and got wet through he felt as if nothing mattered as if his living were smeared away into the beyond near and quite lovable
This strange gentle reachingout to death was new to him
We must go said Miriam
Yes he answered but did not move
To him now life seemed a shadow day a white shadow night and death and stillness and inaction this seemed like BEING
To be alive to be urgent and insistentthat was NOTTOBE
The highest of all was to melt out into the darkness and sway there identified with the great Being
The rain is coming in on us said Miriam
He rose and assisted her
It is a pity he said
What
To have to go
I feel so still
Still
she repeated
Stiller than I have ever been in my life
He was walking with his hand in hers
She pressed his fingers feeling a slight fear
Now he seemed beyond her she had a fear lest she should lose him
The firtrees are like presences on the darkness each one only a presence
She was afraid and said nothing
A sort of hush the whole night wondering and asleep I suppose thats what we do in deathsleep in wonder
She had been afraid before of the brute in him now of the mystic
She trod beside him in silence
The rain fell with a heavy Hush
on the trees
At last they gained the cartshed
Let us stay here awhile he said
There was a sound of rain everywhere smothering everything
I feel so strange and still he said along with everything
Ay she answered patiently
He seemed again unaware of her though he held her hand close
To be rid of our individuality which is our will which is our effortto live effortless a kind of curious sleepthat is very beautiful I think that is our afterlifeour immortality
Yes
Yesand very beautiful to have
You dont usually say that
No
In a while they went indoors
Everybody looked at them curiously
He still kept the quiet heavy look in his eyes the stillness in his voice
Instinctively they all left him alone
About this time Miriams grandmother who lived in a tiny cottage in Woodlinton fell ill and the girl was sent to keep house
It was a beautiful little place
The cottage had a big garden in front with red brick walls against which the plum trees were nailed
At the back another garden was separated from the fields by a tall old hedge
It was very pretty
Miriam had not much to do so she found time for her beloved reading and for writing little introspective pieces which interested her
At the holidaytime her grandmother being better was driven to Derby to stay with her daughter for a day or two
She was a crotchety old lady and might return the second day or the third so Miriam stayed alone in the cottage which also pleased her
Paul used often to cycle over and they had as a rule peaceful and happy times
He did not embarrass her much but then on the Monday of the holiday he was to spend a whole day with her
It was perfect weather
He left his mother telling her where he was going
She would be alone all the day
It cast a shadow over him but he had three days that were all his own when he was going to do as he liked
It was sweet to rush through the morning lanes on his bicycle
He got to the cottage at about eleven oclock
Miriam was busy preparing dinner
She looked so perfectly in keeping with the little kitchen ruddy and busy
He kissed her and sat down to watch
The room was small and cosy
The sofa was covered all over with a sort of linen in squares of red and pale blue old much washed but pretty
There was a stuffed owl in a case over a corner cupboard
The sunlight came through the leaves of the scented geraniums in the window
She was cooking a chicken in his honour
It was their cottage for the day and they were man and wife
He beat the eggs for her and peeled the potatoes
He thought she gave a feeling of home almost like his mother and no one could look more beautiful with her tumbled curls when she was flushed from the fire
The dinner was a great success
Like a young husband he carved
They talked all the time with unflagging zest
Then he wiped the dishes she had washed and they went out down the fields
There was a bright little brook that ran into a bog at the foot of a very steep bank
Here they wandered picking still a few marshmarigolds and many big blue forgetmenots
Then she sat on the bank with her hands full of flowers mostly golden waterblobs
As she put her face down into the marigolds it was all overcast with a yellow shine
Your face is bright he said like a transfiguration
She looked at him questioning
He laughed pleadingly to her laying his hands on hers
Then he kissed her fingers then her face
The world was all steeped in sunshine and quite still yet not asleep but quivering with a kind of expectancy
I have never seen anything more beautiful than this he said
He held her hand fast all the time
And the water singing to itself as it runsdo you love it
She looked at him full of love
His eyes were very dark very bright
Dont you think its a great day
he asked
She murmured her assent
She WAS happy and he saw it
And our dayjust between us he said
They lingered a little while
Then they stood up upon the sweet thyme and he looked down at her simply
Will you come
he asked
They went back to the house hand in hand in silence
The chickens came scampering down the path to her
He locked the door and they had the little house to themselves
He never forgot seeing her as she lay on the bed when he was unfastening his collar
First he saw only her beauty and was blind with it
She had the most beautiful body he had ever imagined
He stood unable to move or speak looking at her his face halfsmiling with wonder
And then he wanted her but as he went forward to her her hands lifted in a little pleading movement and he looked at her face and stopped
Her big brown eyes were watching him still and resigned and loving she lay as if she had given herself up to sacrifice there was her body for him but the look at the back of her eyes like a creature awaiting immolation arrested him and all his blood fell back
You are sure you want me
he asked as if a cold shadow had come over him
Yes quite sure
She was very quiet very calm
She only realised that she was doing something for him
He could hardly bear it
She lay to be sacrificed for him because she loved him so much
And he had to sacrifice her
For a second he wished he were sexless or dead
Then he shut his eyes again to her and his blood beat back again
And afterwards he loved herloved her to the last fibre of his being
He loved her
But he wanted somehow to cry
There was something he could not bear for her sake
He stayed with her till quite late at night
As he rode home he felt that he was finally initiated
He was a youth no longer
But why had he the dull pain in his soul
Why did the thought of death the afterlife seem so sweet and consoling
He spent the week with Miriam and wore her out with his passion before it was gone
He had always almost wilfully to put her out of count and act from the brute strength of his own feelings
And he could not do it often and there remained afterwards always the sense of failure and of death
If he were really with her he had to put aside himself and his desire
If he would have her he had to put her aside
When I come to you he asked her his eyes dark with pain and shame you dont really want me do you
Ah yes
she replied quickly
He looked at her
Nay he said
She began to tremble
You see she said taking his face and shutting it out against her shoulderyou seeas we arehow can I get used to you
It would come all right if we were married
He lifted her head and looked at her
You mean now it is always too much shock
Yesand You are always clenched against me
She was trembling with agitation
You see she said Im not used to the thought You are lately he said
But all my life
Mother said to me There is one thing in marriage that is always dreadful but you have to bear it
And I believed it
And still believe it he said
No
she cried hastily
I believe as you do that loving even in THAT way is the highwater mark of living
That doesnt alter the fact that you never want it
No she said taking his head in her arms and rocking in despair
Dont say so
You dont understand
She rocked with pain
Dont I want your children
But not me
How can you say so
But we must be married to have children Shall we be married then
I want you to have my children
He kissed her hand reverently
She pondered sadly watching him
We are too young she said at length
Twentyfour and twentythree Not yet she pleaded as she rocked herself in distress
When you will he said
She bowed her head gravely
The tone of hopelessness in which he said these things grieved her deeply
It had always been a failure between them
Tacitly she acquiesced in what he felt
And after a week of love he said to his mother suddenly one Sunday night just as they were going to bed I shant go so much to Miriams mother
She was surprised but she would not ask him anything
You please yourself she said
So he went to bed
But there was a new quietness about him which she had wondered at
She almost guessed
She would leave him alone however
Precipitation might spoil things
She watched him in his loneliness wondering where he would end
He was sick and much too quiet for him
There was a perpetual little knitting of his brows such as she had seen when he was a small baby and which had been gone for many years
Now it was the same again
And she could do nothing for him
He had to go on alone make his own way
He continued faithful to Miriam
For one day he had loved her utterly
But it never came again
The sense of failure grew stronger
At first it was only a sadness
Then he began to feel he could not go on
He wanted to run to go abroad anything
Gradually he ceased to ask her to have him
Instead of drawing them together it put them apart
And then he realised consciously that it was no good
It was useless trying it would never be a success between them
For some months he had seen very little of Clara
They had occasionally walked out for half an hour at dinnertime
But he always reserved himself for Miriam
With Clara however his brow cleared and he was gay again
She treated him indulgently as if he were a child
He thought he did not mind
But deep below the surface it piqued him
Sometimes Miriam said What about Clara
I hear nothing of her lately
I walked with her about twenty minutes yesterday he replied
And what did she talk about
I dont know
I suppose I did all the jawingI usually do
I think I was telling her about the strike and how the women took it
Yes
So he gave the account of himself
But insidiously without his knowing it the warmth he felt for Clara drew him away from Miriam for whom he felt responsible and to whom he felt he belonged
He thought he was being quite faithful to her
It was not easy to estimate exactly the strength and warmth of ones feelings for a woman till they have run away with one
He began to give more time to his men friends
There was Jessop at the art school Swain who was chemistry demonstrator at the university Newton who was a teacher besides Edgar and Miriams younger brothers
Pleading work he sketched and studied with Jessop
He called in the university for Swain and the two went down town together
Having come home in the train with Newton he called and had a game of billiards with him in the Moon and Stars
If he gave to Miriam the excuse of his men friends he felt quite justified
His mother began to be relieved
He always told her where he had been
During the summer Clara wore sometimes a dress of soft cotton stuff with loose sleeves
When she lifted her hands her sleeves fell back and her beautiful strong arms shone out
Half a minute he cried
Hold your arm still
He made sketches of her hand and arm and the drawings contained some of the fascination the real thing had for him
Miriam who always went scrupulously through his books and papers saw the drawings
I think Clara has such beautiful arms he said
Yes
When did you draw them
On Tuesday in the workroom
You know Ive got a corner where I can work
Often I can do every single thing they need in the department before dinner
Then I work for myself in the afternoon and just see to things at night
Yes she said turning the leaves of his sketchbook
Frequently he hated Miriam
He hated her as she bent forward and pored over his things
He hated her way of patiently casting him up as if he were an endless psychological account
When he was with her he hated her for having got him and yet not got him and he tortured her
She took all and gave nothing he said
At least she gave no living warmth
She was never alive and giving off life
Looking for her was like looking for something which did not exist
She was only his conscience not his mate
He hated her violently and was more cruel to her
They dragged on till the next summer
He saw more and more of Clara
At last he spoke
He had been sitting working at home one evening
There was between him and his mother a peculiar condition of people frankly finding fault with each other
Mrs Morel was strong on her feet again
He was not going to stick to Miriam
Very well then she would stand aloof till he said something
It had been coming a long time this bursting of the storm in him when he would come back to her
This evening there was between them a peculiar condition of suspense
He worked feverishly and mechanically so that he could escape from himself
It grew late
Through the open door stealthily came the scent of madonna lilies almost as if it were prowling abroad
Suddenly he got up and went out of doors
The beauty of the night made him want to shout
A halfmoon dusky gold was sinking behind the black sycamore at the end of the garden making the sky dull purple with its glow
Nearer a dim white fence of lilies went across the garden and the air all round seemed to stir with scent as if it were alive
He went across the bed of pinks whose keen perfume came sharply across the rocking heavy scent of the lilies and stood alongside the white barrier of flowers
They flagged all loose as if they were panting
The scent made him drunk
He went down to the field to watch the moon sink under
A corncrake in the hayclose called insistently
The moon slid quite quickly downwards growing more flushed
Behind him the great flowers leaned as if they were calling
And then like a shock he caught another perfume something raw and coarse
Hunting round he found the purple iris touched their fleshy throats and their dark grasping hands
At any rate he had found something
They stood stiff in the darkness
Their scent was brutal
The moon was melting down upon the crest of the hill
It was gone all was dark
The corncrake called still
Breaking off a pink he suddenly went indoors
Come my boy said his mother
Im sure its time you went to bed
He stood with the pink against his lips
I shall break off with Miriam mother he answered calmly
She looked up at him over her spectacles
He was staring back at her unswerving
She met his eyes for a moment then took off her glasses
He was white
The male was up in him dominant
She did not want to see him too clearly
But I thought she began
Well he answered I dont love her
I dont want to marry herso I shall have done
But exclaimed his mother amazed I thought lately you had made up your mind to have her and so I said nothing
I hadI wanted tobut now I dont want
Its no good
I shall break off on Sunday
I ought to oughtnt I
You know best
You know I said so long ago
I cant help that now
I shall break off on Sunday
Well said his mother I think it will be best
But lately I decided you had made up your mind to have her so I said nothing and should have said nothing
But I say as I have always said I DONT think she is suited to you
On Sunday I break off he said smelling the pink
He put the flower in his mouth
Unthinking he bared his teeth closed them on the blossom slowly and had a mouthful of petals
These he spat into the fire kissed his mother and went to bed
On Sunday he went up to the farm in the early afternoon
He had written Miriam that they would walk over the fields to Hucknall
His mother was very tender with him
He said nothing
But she saw the effort it was costing
The peculiar set look on his face stilled her
Never mind my son she said
You will be so much better when it is all over 
Paul glanced swiftly at his mother in surprise and resentment
He did not want sympathy
Miriam met him at the laneend
She was wearing a new dress of figured muslin that had short sleeves
Those short sleeves and Miriams brownskinned arms beneath themsuch pitiful resigned armsgave him so much pain that they helped to make him cruel
She had made herself look so beautiful and fresh for him
She seemed to blossom for him alone
Every time he looked at hera mature young woman now and beautiful in her new dressit hurt so much that his heart seemed almost to be bursting with the restraint he put on it
But he had decided and it was irrevocable
On the hills they sat down and he lay with his head in her lap whilst she fingered his hair
She knew that he was not there as she put it
Often when she had him with her she looked for him and could not find him
But this afternoon she was not prepared
It was nearly five oclock when he told her
They were sitting on the bank of a stream where the lip of turf hung over a hollow bank of yellow earth and he was hacking away with a stick as he did when he was perturbed and cruel
I have been thinking he said we ought to break off
Why
she cried in surprise
Because its no good going on
Why is it no good
It isnt
I dont want to marry
I dont want ever to marry
And if were not going to marry its no good going on
But why do you say this now
Because Ive made up my mind
And what about these last months and the things you told me then
I cant help it
I dont want to go on
You dont want any more of me
I want us to break offyou be free of me I free of you
And what about these last months
I dont know
Ive not told you anything but what I thought was true
Then why are you different now
Im notIm the sameonly I know its no good going on
You havent told me why its no good
Because I dont want to go onand I dont want to marry
How many times have you offered to marry me and I wouldnt
I know but I want us to break off
There was silence for a moment or two while he dug viciously at the earth
She bent her head pondering
He was an unreasonable child
He was like an infant which when it has drunk its fill throws away and smashes the cup
She looked at him feeling she could get hold of him and WRING some consistency out of him
But she was helpless
Then she cried I have said you were only fourteenyou are only FOUR
He still dug at the earth viciously
He heard
You are a child of four she repeated in her anger
He did not answer but said in his heart All right if Im a child of four what do you want me for
I dont want another mother
But he said nothing to her and there was silence
And have you told your people
she asked
I have told my mother
There was another long interval of silence
Then what do you WANT
she asked
Why I want us to separate
We have lived on each other all these years now let us stop
I will go my own way without you and you will go your way without me
You will have an independent life of your own then
There was in it some truth that in spite of her bitterness she could not help registering
She knew she felt in a sort of bondage to him which she hated because she could not control it
She hated her love for him from the moment it grew too strong for her
And deep down she had hated him because she loved him and he dominated her
She had resisted his domination
She had fought to keep herself free of him in the last issue
And she was free of him even more than he of her
And he continued we shall always be more or less each others work
You have done a lot for me I for you
Now let us start and live by ourselves
What do you want to do
she asked
Nothingonly to be free he answered
She however knew in her heart that Claras influence was over him to liberate him
But she said nothing
And what have I to tell my mother
she asked
I told my mother he answered that I was breaking offclean and altogether
I shall not tell them at home she said
Frowning You please yourself he said
He knew he had landed her in a nasty hole and was leaving her in the lurch
It angered him
Tell them you wouldnt and wont marry me and have broken off he said
Its true enough
She bit her finger moodily
She thought over their whole affair
She had known it would come to this she had seen it all along
It chimed with her bitter expectation
Alwaysit has always been so
she cried
It has been one long battle between usyou fighting away from me
It came from her unawares like a flash of lightning
The mans heart stood still
Was this how she saw it
But weve had SOME perfect hours SOME perfect times when we were together
he pleaded
Never
she cried never
It has always been you fighting me off
Not alwaysnot at first
he pleaded
Always from the very beginningalways the same
She had finished but she had done enough
He sat aghast
He had wanted to say It has been good but it is at an end
And sheshe whose love he had believed in when he had despised himselfdenied that their love had ever been love
He had always fought away from her
Then it had been monstrous
There had never been anything really between them all the time he had been imagining something where there was nothing
And she had known
She had known so much and had told him so little
She had known all the time
All the time this was at the bottom of her
He sat silent in bitterness
At last the whole affair appeared in a cynical aspect to him
She had really played with him not he with her
She had hidden all her condemnation from him had flattered him and despised him
She despised him now
He grew intellectual and cruel
You ought to marry a man who worships you he said then you could do as you liked with him
Plenty of men will worship you if you get on the private side of their natures
You ought to marry one such
They would never fight you off
Thank you
she said
But dont advise me to marry someone else any more
Youve done it before
Very well he said I will say no more
He sat still feeling as if he had had a blow instead of giving one
Their eight years of friendship and love THE eight years of his life were nullified
When did you think of this
she asked
I thought definitely on Thursday night
I knew it was coming she said
That pleased him bitterly
Oh very well
If she knew then it doesnt come as a surprise to her he thought
And have you said anything to Clara
she asked
No but I shall tell her now
There was a silence
Do you remember the things you said this time last year in my grandmothers housenay last month even
Yes he said I do
And I meant them
I cant help that its failed
It has failed because you want something else
It would have failed whether or not
YOU never believed in me
She laughed strangely
He sat in silence
He was full of a feeling that she had deceived him
She had despised him when he thought she worshipped him
She had let him say wrong things and had not contradicted him
She had let him fight alone
But it stuck in his throat that she had despised him whilst he thought she worshipped him
She should have told him when she found fault with him
She had not played fair
He hated her
All these years she had treated him as if he were a hero and thought of him secretly as an infant a foolish child
Then why had she left the foolish child to his folly
His heart was hard against her
She sat full of bitterness
She had knownoh well she had known
All the time he was away from her she had summed him up seen his littleness his meanness and his folly
Even she had guarded her soul against him
She was not overthrown not prostrated not even much hurt
She had known
Only why as he sat there had he still this strange dominance over her
His very movements fascinated her as if she were hypnotised by him
Yet he was despicable false inconsistent and mean
Why this bondage for her
Why was it the movement of his arm stirred her as nothing else in the world could
Why was she fastened to him
Why even now if he looked at her and commanded her would she have to obey
She would obey him in his trifling commands
But once he was obeyed then she had him in her power she knew to lead him where she would
She was sure of herself
Only this new influence
Ah he was not a man
He was a baby that cries for the newest toy
And all the attachment of his soul would not keep him
Very well he would have to go
But he would come back when he had tired of his new sensation
He hacked at the earth till she was fretted to death
She rose
He sat flinging lumps of earth in the stream
We will go and have tea here
he asked
Yes she answered
They chattered over irrelevant subjects during tea
He held forth on the love of ornamentthe cottage parlour moved him theretoand its connection with aesthetics
She was cold and quiet
As they walked home she asked And we shall not see each other
Noor rarely he answered
Nor write
she asked almost sarcastically
As you will he answered
Were not strangersnever should be whatever happened
I will write to you now and again
You please yourself
I see
she answered cuttingly
But he was at that stage at which nothing else hurts
He had made a great cleavage in his life
He had had a great shock when she had told him their love had been always a conflict
Nothing more mattered
If it never had been much there was no need to make a fuss that it was ended
He left her at the laneend
As she went home solitary in her new frock having her people to face at the other end he stood still with shame and pain in the highroad thinking of the suffering he caused her
In the reaction towards restoring his selfesteem he went into the Willow Tree for a drink
There were four girls who had been out for the day drinking a modest glass of port
They had some chocolates on the table
Paul sat near with his whisky
He noticed the girls whispering and nudging
Presently one a bonny dark hussy leaned to him and said Have a chocolate
The others laughed loudly at her impudence
All right said Paul
Give me a hard onenut
I dont like creams
Here you are then said the girl heres an almond for you
She held the sweet between her fingers
He opened his mouth
She popped it in and blushed
You ARE nice
he said
Well she answered we thought you looked overcast and they dared me offer you a chocolate
I dont mind if I have anotheranother sort he said
And presently they were all laughing together
It was nine oclock when he got home falling dark
He entered the house in silence
His mother who had been waiting rose anxiously
I told her he said
Im glad replied the mother with great relief
He hung up his cap wearily
I said wed have done altogether he said
Thats right my son said the mother
Its hard for her now but best in the long run
I know
You werent suited for her
He laughed shakily as he sat down
Ive had such a lark with some girls in a pub he said
His mother looked at him
He had forgotten Miriam now
He told her about the girls in the Willow Tree
Mrs Morel looked at him
It seemed unreal his gaiety
At the back of it was too much horror and misery
Now have some supper she said very gently
Afterwards he said wistfully She never thought shed have me mother not from the first and so shes not disappointed
Im afraid said his mother she doesnt give up hopes of you yet
No he said perhaps not
Youll find its better to have done she said
I dont know he said desperately
Well leave her alone replied his mother
So he left her and she was alone
Very few people cared for her and she for very few people
She remained alone with herself waiting
CHAPTER XII PASSION HE was gradually making it possible to earn a livelihood by his art
Libertys had taken several of his painted designs on various stuffs and he could sell designs for embroideries for altarcloths and similar things in one or two places
It was not very much he made at present but he might extend it
He had also made friends with the designer for a pottery firm and was gaining some knowledge of his new acquaintances art
The applied arts interested him very much
At the same time he laboured slowly at his pictures
He loved to paint large figures full of light but not merely made up of lights and cast shadows like the impressionists rather definite figures that had a certain luminous quality like some of Michael Angelos people
And these he fitted into a landscape in what he thought true proportion
He worked a great deal from memory using everybody he knew
He believed firmly in his work that it was good and valuable
In spite of fits of depression shrinking everything he believed in his work
He was twentyfour when he said his first confident thing to his mother
Mother he said I sll make a painter that theyll attend to
She sniffed in her quaint fashion
It was like a halfpleased shrug of the shoulders
Very well my boy well see she said
You shall see my pigeon
You see if youre not swanky one of these days
Im quite content my boy she smiled
But youll have to alter
Look at you with Minnie
Minnie was the small servant a girl of fourteen
And what about Minnie
asked Mrs Morel with dignity
I heard her this morning Eh Mrs Morel
I was going to do that when you went out in the rain for some coal he said
That looks a lot like your being able to manage servants
Well it was only the childs niceness said Mrs Morel
And you apologising to her You cant do two things at once can you
She WAS busy washing up replied Mrs Morel
And what did she say
It could easy have waited a bit
Now look how your feet paddle
Yesbrazen young baggage
said Mrs Morel smiling
He looked at his mother laughing
She was quite warm and rosy again with love of him
It seemed as if all the sunshine were on her for a moment
He continued his work gladly
She seemed so well when she was happy that he forgot her grey hair
And that year she went with him to the Isle of Wight for a holiday
It was too exciting for them both and too beautiful
Mrs Morel was full of joy and wonder
But he would have her walk with him more than she was able
She had a bad fainting bout
So grey her face was so blue her mouth
It was agony to him
He felt as if someone were pushing a knife in his chest
Then she was better again and he forgot
But the anxiety remained inside him like a wound that did not close
After leaving Miriam he went almost straight to Clara
On the Monday following the day of the rupture he went down to the workroom
She looked up at him and smiled
They had grown very intimate unawares
She saw a new brightness about him
Well Queen of Sheba
he said laughing
But why
she asked
I think it suits you
Youve got a new frock on
She flushed asking And what of it
Suits youawfully
I could design you a dress
How would it be
He stood in front of her his eyes glittering as he expounded
He kept her eyes fixed with his
Then suddenly he took hold of her
She halfstarted back
He drew the stuff of her blouse tighter smoothed it over her breast
More SO
he explained
But they were both of them flaming with blushes and immediately he ran away
He had touched her
His whole body was quivering with the sensation
There was already a sort of secret understanding between them
The next evening he went to the cinematograph with her for a few minutes before traintime
As they sat he saw her hand lying near him
For some moments he dared not touch it
The pictures danced and dithered
Then he took her hand in his
It was large and firm it filled his grasp
He held it fast
She neither moved nor made any sign
When they came out his train was due
He hesitated
Goodnight she said
He darted away across the road
The next day he came again talking to her
She was rather superior with him
Shall we go a walk on Monday
he asked
She turned her face aside
Shall you tell Miriam
she replied sarcastically
I have broken off with her he said
When
Last Sunday
You quarrelled
No
I had made up my mind
I told her quite definitely I should consider myself free
Clara did not answer and he returned to his work
She was so quiet and so superb
On the Saturday evening he asked her to come and drink coffee with him in a restaurant meeting him after work was over
She came looking very reserved and very distant
He had threequarters of an hour to traintime
We will walk a little while he said
She agreed and they went past the Castle into the Park
He was afraid of her
She walked moodily at his side with a kind of resentful reluctant angry walk
He was afraid to take her hand
Which way shall we go
he asked as they walked in darkness
I dont mind
Then well go up the steps
He suddenly turned round
They had passed the Park steps
She stood still in resentment at his suddenly abandoning her
He looked for her
She stood aloof
He caught her suddenly in his arms held her strained for a moment kissed her
Then he let her go
Come along he said penitent
She followed him
He took her hand and kissed her fingertips
They went in silence
When they came to the light he let go her hand
Neither spoke till they reached the station
Then they looked each other in the eyes
Goodnight she said
And he went for his train
His body acted mechanically
People talked to him
He heard faint echoes answering them
He was in a delirium
He felt that he would go mad if Monday did not come at once
On Monday he would see her again
All himself was pitched there ahead
Sunday intervened
He could not bear it
He could not see her till Monday
And Sunday intervenedhour after hour of tension
He wanted to beat his head against the door of the carriage
But he sat still
He drank some whisky on the way home but it only made it worse
His mother must not be upset that was all
He dissembled and got quickly to bed
There he sat dressed with his chin on his knees staring out of the window at the far hill with its few lights
He neither thought nor slept but sat perfectly still staring
And when at last he was so cold that he came to himself he found his watch had stopped at halfpast two
It was after three oclock
He was exhausted but still there was the torment of knowing it was only Sunday morning
He went to bed and slept
Then he cycled all day long till he was fagged out
And he scarcely knew where he had been
But the day after was Monday
He slept till four oclock
Then he lay and thought
He was coming nearer to himselfhe could see himself real somewhere in front
She would go a walk with him in the afternoon
Afternoon
It seemed years ahead
Slowly the hours crawled
His father got up he heard him pottering about
Then the miner set off to the pit his heavy boots scraping the yard
Cocks were still crowing
A cart went down the road
His mother got up
She knocked the fire
Presently she called him softly
He answered as if he were asleep
This shell of himself did well
He was walking to the stationanother mile
The train was near Nottingham
Would it stop before the tunnels
But it did not matter it would get there before dinnertime
He was at Jordans
She would come in half an hour
At any rate she would be near
He had done the letters
She would be there
Perhaps she had not come
He ran downstairs
Ah
he saw her through the glass door
Her shoulders stooping a little to her work made him feel he could not go forward he could not stand
He went in
He was pale nervous awkward and quite cold
Would she misunderstand him
He could not write his real self with this shell
And this afternoon he struggled to say
You will come
I think so she replied murmuring
He stood before her unable to say a word
She hid her face from him
Again came over him the feeling that he would lose consciousness
He set his teeth and went upstairs
He had done everything correctly yet and he would do so
All the morning things seemed a long way off as they do to a man under chloroform
He himself seemed under a tight band of constraint
Then there was his other self in the distance doing things entering stuff in a ledger and he watched that faroff him carefully to see he made no mistake
But the ache and strain of it could not go on much longer
He worked incessantly
Still it was only twelve oclock
As if he had nailed his clothing against the desk he stood there and worked forcing every stroke out of himself
It was a quarter to one he could clear away
Then he ran downstairs
You will meet me at the Fountain at two oclock he said
I cant be there till halfpast
Yes
he said
She saw his dark mad eyes
I will try at a quarter past
And he had to be content
He went and got some dinner
All the time he was still under chloroform and every minute was stretched out indefinitely
He walked miles of streets
Then he thought he would be late at the meetingplace
He was at the Fountain at five past two
The torture of the next quarter of an hour was refined beyond expression
It was the anguish of combining the living self with the shell
Then he saw her
She came
And he was there
You are late he said
Only five minutes she answered
Id never have done it to you he laughed
She was in a dark blue costume
He looked at her beautiful figure
You want some flowers he said going to the nearest florists
She followed him in silence
He bought her a bunch of scarlet brickred carnations
She put them in her coat flushing
Thats a fine colour
he said
Id rather have had something softer she said
He laughed
Do you feel like a blot of vermilion walking down the street
he said
She hung her head afraid of the people they met
He looked sideways at her as they walked
There was a wonderful close down on her face near the ear that he wanted to touch
And a certain heaviness the heaviness of a very full ear of corn that dips slightly in the wind that there was about her made his brain spin
He seemed to be spinning down the street everything going round
As they sat in the tramcar she leaned her heavy shoulder against him and he took her hand
He felt himself coming round from the anaesthetic beginning to breathe
Her ear halfhidden among her blonde hair was near to him
The temptation to kiss it was almost too great
But there were other people on top of the car
It still remained to him to kiss it
After all he was not himself he was some attribute of hers like the sunshine that fell on her
He looked quickly away
It had been raining
The big bluff of the Castle rock was streaked with rain as it reared above the flat of the town
They crossed the wide black space of the Midland Railway and passed the cattle enclosure that stood out white
Then they ran down sordid Wilford Road
She rocked slightly to the trams motion and as she leaned against him rocked upon him
He was a vigorous slender man with exhaustless energy
His face was rough with roughhewn features like the common peoples but his eyes under the deep brows were so full of life that they fascinated her
They seemed to dance and yet they were still trembling on the finest balance of laughter
His mouth the same was just going to spring into a laugh of triumph yet did not
There was a sharp suspense about him
She bit her lip moodily
His hand was hard clenched over hers
They paid their two halfpennies at the turnstile and crossed the bridge
The Trent was very full
It swept silent and insidious under the bridge travelling in a soft body
There had been a great deal of rain
On the river levels were flat gleams of flood water
The sky was grey with glisten of silver here and there
In Wilford churchyard the dahlias were sodden with rainwet blackcrimson balls
No one was on the path that went along the green river meadow along the elmtree colonnade
There was the faintest haze over the silverydark water and the green meadowbank and the elmtrees that were spangled with gold
The river slid by in a body utterly silent and swift intertwining among itself like some subtle complex creature
Clara walked moodily beside him
Why she asked at length in rather a jarring tone did you leave Miriam
He frowned
Because I WANTED to leave her he said
Why
Because I didnt want to go on with her
And I didnt want to marry
She was silent for a moment
They picked their way down the muddy path
Drops of water fell from the elmtrees
You didnt want to marry Miriam or you didnt want to marry at all
she asked
Both he answeredboth
They had to manoeuvre to get to the stile because of the pools of water
And what did she say
Clara asked
Miriam
She said I was a baby of four and that I always HAD battled her off
Clara pondered over this for a time
But you have really been going with her for some time
she asked
Yes
And now you dont want any more of her
No
I know its no good
She pondered again
Dont you think youve treated her rather badly
she asked
Yes I ought to have dropped it years back
But it would have been no good going on
Two wrongs dont make a right
How old ARE you
Clara asked
Twentyfive
And I am thirty she said
I know you are
I shall be thirtyoneor AM I thirtyone
I neither know nor care
What does it matter
They were at the entrance to the Grove
The wet red track already sticky with fallen leaves went up the steep bank between the grass
On either side stood the elmtrees like pillars along a great aisle arching over and making high up a roof from which the dead leaves fell
All was empty and silent and wet
She stood on top of the stile and he held both her hands
Laughing she looked down into his eyes
Then she leaped
Her breast came against his he held her and covered her face with kisses
They went on up the slippery steep red path
Presently she released his hand and put it round her waist
You press the vein in my arm holding it so tightly she said
They walked along
His fingertips felt the rocking of her breast
All was silent and deserted
On the left the red wet ploughland showed through the doorways between the elmboles and their branches
On the right looking down they could see the treetops of elms growing far beneath them hear occasionally the gurgle of the river
Sometimes there below they caught glimpses of the full softsliding Trent and of watermeadows dotted with small cattle
It has scarcely altered since little Kirke White used to come he said
But he was watching her throat below the ear where the flush was fusing into the honeywhite and her mouth that pouted disconsolate
She stirred against him as she walked and his body was like a taut string
Halfway up the big colonnade of elms where the Grove rose highest above the river their forward movement faltered to an end
He led her across to the grass under the trees at the edge of the path
The cliff of red earth sloped swiftly down through trees and bushes to the river that glimmered and was dark between the foliage
The farbelow watermeadows were very green
He and she stood leaning against one another silent afraid their bodies touching all along
There came a quick gurgle from the river below
Why he asked at length did you hate Baxter Dawes
She turned to him with a splendid movement
Her mouth was offered him and her throat her eyes were halfshut her breast was tilted as if it asked for him
He flashed with a small laugh shut his eyes and met her in a long whole kiss
Her mouth fused with his their bodies were sealed and annealed
It was some minutes before they withdrew
They were standing beside the public path
Will you go down to the river
he asked
She looked at him leaving herself in his hands
He went over the brim of the declivity and began to climb down
It is slippery he said
Never mind she replied
The red clay went down almost sheer
He slid went from one tuft of grass to the next hanging on to the bushes making for a little platform at the foot of a tree
There he waited for her laughing with excitement
Her shoes were clogged with red earth
It was hard for her
He frowned
At last he caught her hand and she stood beside him
The cliff rose above them and fell away below
Her colour was up her eyes flashed
He looked at the big drop below them
Its risky he said or messy at any rate
Shall we go back
Not for my sake she said quickly
All right
You see I cant help you I should only hinder
Give me that little parcel and your gloves
Your poor shoes
They stood perched on the face of the declivity under the trees
Well Ill go again he said
Away he went slipping staggering sliding to the next tree into which he fell with a slam that nearly shook the breath out of him
She came after cautiously hanging on to the twigs and grasses
So they descended stage by stage to the rivers brink
There to his disgust the flood had eaten away the path and the red decline ran straight into the water
He dug in his heels and brought himself up violently
The string of the parcel broke with a snap the brown parcel bounded down leaped into the water and sailed smoothly away
He hung on to his tree
Well Ill be damned
he cried crossly
Then he laughed
She was coming perilously down
Mind
he warned her
He stood with his back to the tree waiting
Come now he called opening his arms
She let herself run
He caught her and together they stood watching the dark water scoop at the raw edge of the bank
The parcel had sailed out of sight
It doesnt matter she said
He held her close and kissed her
There was only room for their four feet
Its a swindle
he said
But theres a rut where a man has been so if we go on I guess we shall find the path again
The river slid and twined its great volume
On the other bank cattle were feeding on the desolate flats
The cliff rose high above Paul and Clara on their right hand
They stood against the tree in the watery silence
Let us try going forward he said and they struggled in the red clay along the groove a mans nailed boots had made
They were hot and flushed
Their barkled shoes hung heavy on their steps
At last they found the broken path
It was littered with rubble from the water but at any rate it was easier
They cleaned their boots with twigs
His heart was beating thick and fast
Suddenly coming on to the little level he saw two figures of men standing silent at the waters edge
His heart leaped
They were fishing
He turned and put his hand up warningly to Clara
She hesitated buttoned her coat
The two went on together
The fishermen turned curiously to watch the two intruders on their privacy and solitude
They had had a fire but it was nearly out
All kept perfectly still
The men turned again to their fishing stood over the grey glinting river like statues
Clara went with bowed head flushing he was laughing to himself
Directly they passed out of sight behind the willows
Now they ought to be drowned said Paul softly
Clara did not answer
They toiled forward along a tiny path on the rivers lip
Suddenly it vanished
The bank was sheer red solid clay in front of them sloping straight into the river
He stood and cursed beneath his breath setting his teeth
Its impossible
said Clara
He stood erect looking round
Just ahead were two islets in the stream covered with osiers
But they were unattainable
The cliff came down like a sloping wall from far above their heads
Behind not far back were the fishermen
Across the river the distant cattle fed silently in the desolate afternoon
He cursed again deeply under his breath
He gazed up the great steep bank
Was there no hope but to scale back to the public path
Stop a minute he said and digging his heels sideways into the steep bank of red clay he began nimbly to mount
He looked across at every treefoot
At last he found what he wanted
Two beechtrees side by side on the hill held a little level on the upper face between their roots
It was littered with damp leaves but it would do
The fishermen were perhaps sufficiently out of sight
He threw down his rainproof and waved to her to come
She toiled to his side
Arriving there she looked at him heavily dumbly and laid her head on his shoulder
He held her fast as he looked round
They were safe enough from all but the small lonely cows over the river
He sunk his mouth on her throat where he felt her heavy pulse beat under his lips
Everything was perfectly still
There was nothing in the afternoon but themselves
When she arose he looking on the ground all the time saw suddenly sprinkled on the black wet beechroots many scarlet carnation petals like splashed drops of blood and red small splashes fell from her bosom streaming down her dress to her feet
Your flowers are smashed he said
She looked at him heavily as she put back her hair
Suddenly he put his fingertips on her cheek
Why dost look so heavy
he reproached her
She smiled sadly as if she felt alone in herself
He caressed her cheek with his fingers and kissed her
Nay
he said
Never thee bother
She gripped his fingers tight and laughed shakily
Then she dropped her hand
He put the hair back from her brows stroking her temples kissing them lightly
But tha shouldna worrit
he said softly pleading
No I dont worry
she laughed tenderly and resigned
Yea tha does
Dunna thee worrit he implored caressing
No
she consoled him kissing him
They had a stiff climb to get to the top again
It took them a quarter of an hour
When he got on to the level grass he threw off his cap wiped the sweat from his forehead and sighed
Now were back at the ordinary level he said
She sat down panting on the tussocky grass
Her cheeks were flushed pink
He kissed her and she gave way to joy
And now Ill clean thy boots and make thee fit for respectable folk he said
He kneeled at her feet worked away with a stick and tufts of grass
She put her fingers in his hair drew his head to her and kissed it
What am I supposed to be doing he said looking at her laughing cleaning shoes or dibbling with love
Answer me that
Just whichever I please she replied
Im your bootboy for the time being and nothing else
But they remained looking into each others eyes and laughing
Then they kissed with little nibbling kisses
Tttt
he went with his tongue like his mother
I tell you nothing gets done when theres a woman about
And he returned to his bootcleaning singing softly
She touched his thick hair and he kissed her fingers
He worked away at her shoes
At last they were quite presentable
There you are you see
he said
Arent I a great hand at restoring you to respectability
Stand up
There you look as irreproachable as Britannia herself
He cleaned his own boots a little washed his hands in a puddle and sang
They went on into Clifton village
He was madly in love with her every movement she made every crease in her garments sent a hot flash through him and seemed adorable
The old lady at whose house they had tea was roused into gaiety by them
I could wish youd had something of a better day she said hovering round
Nay
he laughed
Weve been saying how nice it is
The old lady looked at him curiously
There was a peculiar glow and charm about him
His eyes were dark and laughing
He rubbed his moustache with a glad movement
Have you been saying SO
she exclaimed a light rousing in her old eyes
Truly
he laughed
Then Im sure the days good enough said the old lady
She fussed about and did not want to leave them
I dont know whether youd like some radishes as well she said to Clara but Ive got some in the gardenAND a cucumber
Clara flushed
She looked very handsome
I should like some radishes she answered
And the old lady pottered off gleefully
If she knew
said Clara quietly to him
Well she doesnt know and it shows were nice in ourselves at any rate
You look quite enough to satisfy an archangel and Im sure I feel harmlesssoif it makes you look nice and makes folk happy when they have us and makes us happywhy were not cheating them out of much
They went on with the meal
When they were going away the old lady came timidly with three tiny dahlias in full blow neat as bees and speckled scarlet and white
She stood before Clara pleased with herself saying I dont know whether and holding the flowers forward in her old hand
Oh how pretty
cried Clara accepting the flowers
Shall she have them all
asked Paul reproachfully of the old woman
Yes she shall have them all she replied beaming with joy
You have got enough for your share
Ah but I shall ask her to give me one
he teased
Then she does as she pleases said the old lady smiling
And she bobbed a little curtsey of delight
Clara was rather quiet and uncomfortable
As they walked along he said You dont feel criminal do you
She looked at him with startled grey eyes
Criminal
she said
No
But you seem to feel you have done a wrong
No she said
I only think If they knew
If they knew theyd cease to understand
As it is they do understand and they like it
What do they matter
Here with only the trees and me you dont feel not the least bit wrong do you
He took her by the arm held her facing him holding her eyes with his
Something fretted him
Not sinners are we
he said with an uneasy little frown
No she replied
He kissed her laughing
You like your little bit of guiltiness I believe he said
I believe Eve enjoyed it when she went cowering out of Paradise
But there was a certain glow and quietness about her that made him glad
When he was alone in the railwaycarriage he found himself tumultuously happy and the people exceedingly nice and the night lovely and everything good
Mrs Morel was sitting reading when he got home
Her health was not good now and there had come that ivory pallor into her face which he never noticed and which afterwards he never forgot
She did not mention her own illhealth to him
After all she thought it was not much
You are late
she said looking at him
His eyes were shining his face seemed to glow
He smiled to her
Yes Ive been down Clifton Grove with Clara
His mother looked at him again
But wont people talk
she said
Why
They know shes a suffragette and so on
And what if they do talk
Of course there may be nothing wrong in it said his mother
But you know what folks are and if once she gets talked about Well I cant help it
Their jaw isnt so almighty important after all
I think you ought to consider HER
So I DO
What can people saythat we take a walk together
I believe youre jealous
You know I should be GLAD if she werent a married woman
Well my dear she lives separate from her husband and talks on platforms so shes already singled out from the sheep and as far as I can see hasnt much to lose
No her lifes nothing to her so whats the worth of nothing
She goes with meit becomes something
Then she must paywe both must pay
Folk are so frightened of paying theyd rather starve and die
Very well my son
Well see how it will end
Very well my mother
Ill abide by the end
Well see
And shesshes AWFULLY nice mother she is really
You dont know
Thats not the same as marrying her
Its perhaps better
There was silence for a while
He wanted to ask his mother something but was afraid
Should you like to know her
He hesitated
Yes said Mrs Morel coolly
I should like to know what shes like
But shes nice mother she is
And not a bit common
I never suggested she was
But you seem to think shesnot as good as Shes better than ninetynine folk out of a hundred I tell you
Shes BETTER she is
Shes fair shes honest shes straight
There isnt anything underhand or superior about her
Dont be mean about her
Mrs Morel flushed
I am sure I am not mean about her
She may be quite as you say but You dont approve he finished
And do you expect me to
she answered coldly
Yesyesif youd anything about you youd be glad
Do you WANT to see her
I said I did
Then Ill bring hershall I bring her here
You please yourself
Then I WILL bring her hereone Sundayto tea
If you think a horrid thing about her I shant forgive you
His mother laughed
As if it would make any difference
she said
He knew he had won
Oh but it feels so fine when shes there
Shes such a queen in her way
Occasionally he still walked a little way from chapel with Miriam and Edgar
He did not go up to the farm
She however was very much the same with him and he did not feel embarrassed in her presence
One evening she was alone when he accompanied her
They began by talking books it was their unfailing topic
Mrs Morel had said that his and Miriams affair was like a fire fed on booksif there were no more volumes it would die out
Miriam for her part boasted that she could read him like a book could place her finger any minute on the chapter and the line
He easily taken in believed that Miriam knew more about him than anyone else
So it pleased him to talk to her about himself like the simplest egoist
Very soon the conversation drifted to his own doings
It flattered him immensely that he was of such supreme interest
And what have you been doing lately
Ioh not much
I made a sketch of Bestwood from the garden that is nearly right at last
Its the hundredth try
So they went on
Then she said Youve not been out then lately
Yes I went up Clifton Grove on Monday afternoon with Clara
It was not very nice weather said Miriam was it
But I wanted to go out and it was all right
The Trent IS full
And did you go to Barton
she asked
No we had tea in Clifton
DID you
That would be nice
It was
The jolliest old woman
She gave us several pompom dahlias as pretty as you like
Miriam bowed her head and brooded
He was quite unconscious of concealing anything from her
What made her give them you
she asked
He laughed
Because she liked usbecause we were jolly I should think
Miriam put her finger in her mouth
Were you late home
she asked
At last he resented her tone
I caught the seventhirty
Ha
They walked on in silence and he was angry
And how IS Clara
asked Miriam
Quite all right I think
Thats good
she said with a tinge of irony
By the way what of her husband
One never hears anything of him
Hes got some other woman and is also quite all right he replied
At least so I think
I seeyou dont know for certain
Dont you think a position like that is hard on a woman
Rottenly hard
Its so unjust
said Miriam
The man does as he likes Then let the woman also he said
How can she
And if she does look at her position
What of it
Why its impossible
You dont understand what a woman forfeits No I dont
But if a womans got nothing but her fair fame to feed on why its thin tack and a donkey would die of it
So she understood his moral attitude at least and she knew he would act accordingly
She never asked him anything direct but she got to know enough
Another day when he saw Miriam the conversation turned to marriage then to Claras marriage with Dawes
You see he said she never knew the fearful importance of marriage
She thought it was all in the days marchit would have to comeand Daweswell a good many women would have given their souls to get him so why not him
Then she developed into the femme incomprise and treated him badly Ill bet my boots
And she left him because he didnt understand her
I suppose so
I suppose she had to
It isnt altogether a question of understanding its a question of living
With him she was only halfalive the rest was dormant deadened
And the dormant woman was the femme incomprise and she HAD to be awakened
And what about him
I dont know
I rather think he loves her as much as he can but hes a fool
It was something like your mother and father said Miriam
Yes but my mother I believe got real joy and satisfaction out of my father at first
I believe she had a passion for him thats why she stayed with him
After all they were bound to each other
Yes said Miriam
Thats what one MUST HAVE I think he continuedthe real real flame of feeling through another persononce only once if it only lasts three months
See my mother looks as if shed HAD everything that was necessary for her living and developing
Theres not a tiny bit of feeling of sterility about her
No said Miriam
And with my father at first Im sure she had the real thing
She knows she has been there
You can feet it about her and about him and about hundreds of people you meet every day and once it has happened to you you can go on with anything and ripen
What happened exactly
asked Miriam
Its so hard to say but the something big and intense that changes you when you really come together with somebody else
It almost seems to fertilise your soul and make it that you can go on and mature
And you think your mother had it with your father
Yes and at the bottom she feels grateful to him for giving it her even now though they are miles apart
And you think Clara never had it
Im sure
Miriam pondered this
She saw what he was seekinga sort of baptism of fire in passion it seemed to her
She realised that he would never be satisfied till he had it
Perhaps it was essential to him as to some men to sow wild oats and afterwards when he was satisfied he would not rage with restlessness any more but could settle down and give her his life into her hands
Well then if he must go let him go and have his fillsomething big and intense he called it
At any rate when he had got it he would not want itthat he said himself he would want the other thing that she could give him
He would want to be owned so that he could work
It seemed to her a bitter thing that he must go but she could let him go into an inn for a glass of whisky so she could let him go to Clara so long as it was something that would satisfy a need in him and leave him free for herself to possess
Have you told your mother about Clara
she asked
She knew this would be a test of the seriousness of his feeling for the other woman she knew he was going to Clara for something vital not as a man goes for pleasure to a prostitute if he told his mother
Yes he said and she is coming to tea on Sunday
To your house
Yes I want mater to see her
Ah
There was a silence
Things had gone quicker than she thought
She felt a sudden bitterness that he could leave her so soon and so entirely
And was Clara to be accepted by his people who had been so hostile to herself
I may call in as I go to chapel she said
It is a long time since I saw Clara
Very well he said astonished and unconsciously angry
On the Sunday afternoon he went to Keston to meet Clara at the station
As he stood on the platform he was trying to examine in himself if he had a premonition
Do I FEEL as if shed come
he said to himself and he tried to find out
His heart felt queer and contracted
That seemed like foreboding
Then he HAD a foreboding she would not come
Then she would not come and instead of taking her over the fields home as he had imagined he would have to go alone
The train was late the afternoon would be wasted and the evening
He hated her for not coming
Why had she promised then if she could not keep her promise
Perhaps she had missed her trainhe himself was always missing trainsbut that was no reason why she should miss this particular one
He was angry with her he was furious
Suddenly he saw the train crawling sneaking round the corner
Here then was the train but of course she had not come
The green engine hissed along the platform the row of brown carriages drew up several doors opened
No she had not come
No
Yes ah there she was
She had a big black hat on
He was at her side in a moment
I thought you werent coming he said
She was laughing rather breathlessly as she put out her hand to him their eyes met
He took her quickly along the platform talking at a great rate to hide his feeling
She looked beautiful
In her hat were large silk roses coloured like tarnished gold
Her costume of dark cloth fitted so beautifully over her breast and shoulders
His pride went up as he walked with her
He felt the station people who knew him eyed her with awe and admiration
I was sure you werent coming he laughed shakily
She laughed in answer almost with a little cry
And I wondered when I was in the train WHATEVER I should do if you werent there
she said
He caught her hand impulsively and they went along the narrow twitchel
They took the road into Nuttall and over the Reckoning House Farm
It was a blue mild day
Everywhere the brown leaves lay scattered many scarlet hips stood upon the hedge beside the wood
He gathered a few for her to wear
Though really he said as he fitted them into the breast of her coat you ought to object to my getting them because of the birds
But they dont care much for rosehips in this part where they can get plenty of stuff
You often find the berries going rotten in the springtime
So he chattered scarcely aware of what he said only knowing he was putting berries in the bosom of her coat while she stood patiently for him
And she watched his quick hands so full of life and it seemed to her she had never SEEN anything before
Till now everything had been indistinct
They came near to the colliery
It stood quite still and black among the cornfields its immense heap of slag seen rising almost from the oats
What a pity there is a coalpit here where it is so pretty
said Clara
Do you think so
he answered
You see I am so used to it I should miss it
No and I like the pits here and there
I like the rows of trucks and the headstocks and the steam in the daytime and the lights at night
When I was a boy I always thought a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night was a pit with its steam and its lights and the burning bankand I thought the Lord was always at the pittop
As they drew near home she walked in silence and seemed to hang back
He pressed her fingers in his own
She flushed but gave no response
Dont you want to come home
he asked
Yes I want to come she replied
It did not occur to him that her position in his home would be rather a peculiar and difficult one
To him it seemed just as if one of his men friends were going to be introduced to his mother only nicer
The Morels lived in a house in an ugly street that ran down a steep hill
The street itself was hideous
The house was rather superior to most
It was old grimy with a big bay window and it was semidetached but it looked gloomy
Then Paul opened the door to the garden and all was different
The sunny afternoon was there like another land
By the path grew tansy and little trees
In front of the window was a plot of sunny grass with old lilacs round it
And away went the garden with heaps of dishevelled chrysanthemums in the sunshine down to the sycamoretree and the field and beyond one looked over a few redroofed cottages to the hills with all the glow of the autumn afternoon
Mrs Morel sat in her rockingchair wearing her black silk blouse
Her greybrown hair was taken smooth back from her brow and her high temples her face was rather pale
Clara suffering followed Paul into the kitchen
Mrs Morel rose
Clara thought her a lady even rather stiff
The young woman was very nervous
She had almost a wistful look almost resigned
MotherClara said Paul
Mrs Morel held out her hand and smiled
He has told me a good deal about you she said
The blood flamed in Claras cheek
I hope you dont mind my coming she faltered
I was pleased when he said he would bring you replied Mrs Morel
Paul watching felt his heart contract with pain
His mother looked so small and sallow and donefor beside the luxuriant Clara
Its such a pretty day mother
he said
And we saw a jay
His mother looked at him he had turned to her
She thought what a man he seemed in his dark wellmade clothes
He was pale and detachedlooking it would be hard for any woman to keep him
Her heart glowed then she was sorry for Clara
Perhaps youll leave your things in the parlour said Mrs Morel nicely to the young woman
Oh thank you she replied
Come on said Paul and he led the way into the little front room with its old piano its mahogany furniture its yellowing marble mantelpiece
A fire was burning the place was littered with books and drawingboards
I leave my things lying about he said
Its so much easier
She loved his artists paraphernalia and the books and the photos of people
Soon he was telling her this was William this was Williams young lady in the evening dress this was Annie and her husband this was Arthur and his wife and the baby
She felt as if she were being taken into the family
He showed her photos books sketches and they talked a little while
Then they returned to the kitchen
Mrs Morel put aside her book
Clara wore a blouse of fine silk chiffon with narrow blackandwhite stripes her hair was done simply coiled on top of her head
She looked rather stately and reserved
You have gone to live down Sneinton Boulevard
said Mrs Morel
When I was a girlgirl I saywhen I was a young woman WE lived in Minerva Terrace
Oh did you
said Clara
I have a friend in number 6
And the conversation had started
They talked Nottingham and Nottingham people it interested them both
Clara was still rather nervous Mrs Morel was still somewhat on her dignity
She clipped her language very clear and precise
But they were going to get on well together Paul saw
Mrs Morel measured herself against the younger woman and found herself easily stronger
Clara was deferential
She knew Pauls surprising regard for his mother and she had dreaded the meeting expecting someone rather hard and cold
She was surprised to find this little interested woman chatting with such readiness and then she felt as she felt with Paul that she would not care to stand in Mrs Morels way
There was something so hard and certain in his mother as if she never had a misgiving in her life
Presently Morel came down ruffled and yawning from his afternoon sleep
He scratched his grizzled head he plodded in his stocking feet his waistcoat hung open over his shirt
He seemed incongruous
This is Mrs Dawes father said Paul
Then Morel pulled himself together
Clara saw Pauls manner of bowing and shaking hands
Oh indeed
exclaimed Morel
I am very glad to see youI am I assure you
But dont disturb yourself
No no make yourself quite comfortable and be very welcome
Clara was astonished at this flood of hospitality from the old collier
He was so courteous so gallant
She thought him most delightful
And may you have come far
he asked
Only from Nottingham she said
From Nottingham
Then you have had a beautiful day for your journey
Then he strayed into the scullery to wash his hands and face and from force of habit came on to the hearth with the towel to dry himself
At tea Clara felt the refinement and sangfroid of the household
Mrs Morel was perfectly at her ease
The pouring out the tea and attending to the people went on unconsciously without interrupting her in her talk
There was a lot of room at the oval table the china of dark blue willowpattern looked pretty on the glossy cloth
There was a little bowl of small yellow chrysanthemums
Clara felt she completed the circle and it was a pleasure to her
But she was rather afraid of the selfpossession of the Morels father and all
She took their tone there was a feeling of balance
It was a cool clear atmosphere where everyone was himself and in harmony
Clara enjoyed it but there was a fear deep at the bottom of her
Paul cleared the table whilst his mother and Clara talked
Clara was conscious of his quick vigorous body as it came and went seeming blown quickly by a wind at its work
It was almost like the hither and thither of a leaf that comes unexpected
Most of herself went with him
By the way she leaned forward as if listening Mrs Morel could see she was possessed elsewhere as she talked and again the elder woman was sorry for her
Having finished he strolled down the garden leaving the two women to talk
It was a hazy sunny afternoon mild and soft
Clara glanced through the window after him as he loitered among the chrysanthemums
She felt as if something almost tangible fastened her to him yet he seemed so easy in his graceful indolent movement so detached as he tied up the tooheavy flower branches to their stakes that she wanted to shriek in her helplessness
Mrs Morel rose
You will let me help you wash up said Clara
Eh there are so few it will only take a minute said the other
Clara however dried the teathings and was glad to be on such good terms with his mother but it was torture not to be able to follow him down the garden
At last she allowed herself to go she felt as if a rope were taken off her ankle
The afternoon was golden over the hills of Derbyshire
He stood across in the other garden beside a bush of pale Michaelmas daisies watching the last bees crawl into the hive
Hearing her coming he turned to her with an easy motion saying Its the end of the run with these chaps
Clara stood near him
Over the low red wall in front was the country and the faroff hills all golden dim
At that moment Miriam was entering through the gardendoor
She saw Clara go up to him saw him turn and saw them come to rest together
Something in their perfect isolation together made her know that it was accomplished between them that they were as she put it married
She walked very slowly down the cindertrack of the long garden
Clara had pulled a button from a hollyhock spire and was breaking it to get the seeds
Above her bowed head the pink flowers stared as if defending her
The last bees were falling down to the hive
Count your money laughed Paul as she broke the flat seeds one by one from the roll of coin
She looked at him
Im well off she said smiling
How much
Pf
He snapped his fingers
Can I turn them into gold
Im afraid not she laughed
They looked into each others eyes laughing
At that moment they became aware of Miriam
There was a click and everything had altered
Hello Miriam
he exclaimed
You said youd come
Yes
Had you forgotten
She shook hands with Clara saying It seems strange to see you here
Yes replied the other it seems strange to be here
There was a hesitation
This is pretty isnt it
said Miriam
I like it very much replied Clara
Then Miriam realised that Clara was accepted as she had never been
Have you come down alone
asked Paul
Yes I went to Agathas to tea
We are going to chapel
I only called in for a moment to see Clara
You should have come in here to tea he said
Miriam laughed shortly and Clara turned impatiently aside
Do you like the chrysanthemums
he asked
Yes they are very fine replied Miriam
Which sort do you like best
he asked
I dont know
The bronze I think
I dont think youve seen all the sorts
Come and look
Come and see which are YOUR favourites Clara
He led the two women back to his own garden where the towsled bushes of flowers of all colours stood raggedly along the path down to the field
The situation did not embarrass him to his knowledge
Look Miriam these are the white ones that came from your garden
They arent so fine here are they
No said Miriam
But theyre hardier
Youre so sheltered things grow big and tender and then die
These little yellow ones I like
Will you have some
While they were out there the bells began to ring in the church sounding loud across the town and the field
Miriam looked at the tower proud among the clustering roofs and remembered the sketches he had brought her
It had been different then but he had not left her even yet
She asked him for a book to read
He ran indoors
What
is that Miriam
asked his mother coldly
Yes she said shed call and see Clara
You told her then
came the sarcastic answer
Yes why shouldnt I
Theres certainly no reason why you shouldnt said Mrs Morel and she returned to her book
He winced from his mothers irony frowned irritably thinking Why cant I do as I like
Youve not seen Mrs Morel before
Miriam was saying to Clara
No but shes so nice
Yes said Miriam dropping her head in some ways shes very fine
I should think so
Had Paul told you much about her
He had talked a good deal
Ha
There was silence until he returned with the book
When will you want it back
Miriam asked
When you like he answered
Clara turned to go indoors whilst he accompanied Miriam to the gate
When will you come up to Willey Farm
the latter asked
I couldnt say replied Clara
Mother asked me to say shed be pleased to see you any time if you cared to come
Thank you I should like to but I cant say when
Oh very well
exclaimed Miriam rather bitterly turning away
She went down the path with her mouth to the flowers he had given her
Youre sure you wont come in
he said
No thanks
We are going to chapel
Ah I shall see you then
Miriam was very bitter
Yes
They parted
He felt guilty towards her
She was bitter and she scorned him
He still belonged to herself she believed yet he could have Clara take her home sit with her next his mother in chapel give her the same hymnbook he had given herself years before
She heard him running quickly indoors
But he did not go straight in
Halting on the plot of grass he heard his mothers voice then Claras answer What I hate is the bloodhound quality in Miriam
Yes said his mother quickly yes DOESNT it make you hate her now
His heart went hot and he was angry with them for talking about the girl
What right had they to say that
Something in the speech itself stung him into a flame of hate against Miriam
Then his own heart rebelled furiously at Claras taking the liberty of speaking so about Miriam
After all the girl was the better woman of the two he thought if it came to goodness
He went indoors
His mother looked excited
She was beating with her hand rhythmically on the sofaarm as women do who are wearing out
He could never bear to see the movement
There was a silence then he began to talk
In chapel Miriam saw him find the place in the hymnbook for Clara in exactly the same way as he used for herself
And during the sermon he could see the girl across the chapel her hat throwing a dark shadow over her face
What did she think seeing Clara with him
He did not stop to consider
He felt himself cruel towards Miriam
After chapel he went over Pentrich with Clara
It was a dark autumn night
They had said goodbye to Miriam and his heart had smitten him as he left the girl alone
But it serves her right he said inside himself and it almost gave him pleasure to go off under her eyes with this other handsome woman
There was a scent of damp leaves in the darkness
Claras hand lay warm and inert in his own as they walked
He was full of conflict
The battle that raged inside him made him feel desperate
Up Pentrich Hill Clara leaned against him as he went
He slid his arm round her waist
Feeling the strong motion of her body under his arm as she walked the tightness in his chest because of Miriam relaxed and the hot blood bathed him
He held her closer and closer
Then You still keep on with Miriam she said quietly
Only talk
There never WAS a great deal more than talk between us he said bitterly
Your mother doesnt care for her said Clara
No or I might have married her
But its all up really
Suddenly his voice went passionate with hate
If I was with her now we should be jawing about the Christian Mystery or some such tack
Thank God Im not
They walked on in silence for some time
But you cant really give her up said Clara
I dont give her up because theres nothing to give he said
There is for her
I dont know why she and I shouldnt be friends as long as we live he said
But itll only be friends
Clara drew away from him leaning away from contact with him
What are you drawing away for
he asked
She did not answer but drew farther from him
Why do you want to walk alone
he asked
Still there was no answer
She walked resentfully hanging her head
Because I said I would be friends with Miriam
he exclaimed
She would not answer him anything
I tell you its only words that go between us he persisted trying to take her again
She resisted
Suddenly he strode across in front of her barring her way
Damn it
he said
What do you want now
Youd better run after Miriam mocked Clara
The blood flamed up in him
He stood showing his teeth
She drooped sulkily
The lane was dark quite lonely
He suddenly caught her in his arms stretched forward and put his mouth on her face in a kiss of rage
She turned frantically to avoid him
He held her fast
Hard and relentless his mouth came for her
Her breasts hurt against the wall of his chest
Helpless she went loose in his arms and he kissed her and kissed her
He heard people coming down the hill
Stand up
stand up
he said thickly gripping her arm till it hurt
If he had let go she would have sunk to the ground
She sighed and walked dizzily beside him
They went on in silence
We will go over the fields he said and then she woke up
But she let herself be helped over the stile and she walked in silence with him over the first dark field
It was the way to Nottingham and to the station she knew
He seemed to be looking about
They came out on a bare hilltop where stood the dark figure of the ruined windmill
There he halted
They stood together high up in the darkness looking at the lights scattered on the night before them handfuls of glittering points villages lying high and low on the dark here and there
Like treading among the stars he said with a quaky laugh
Then he took her in his arms and held her fast
She moved aside her mouth to ask dogged and low What time is it
It doesnt matter he pleaded thickly
Yes it doesyes
I must go
Its early yet he said
What time is it
she insisted
All round lay the black night speckled and spangled with lights
I dont know
She put her hand on his chest feeling for his watch
He felt the joints fuse into fire
She groped in his waistcoat pocket while he stood panting
In the darkness she could see the round pale face of the watch but not the figures
She stooped over it
He was panting till he could take her in his arms again
I cant see she said
Then dont bother
Yes Im going
she said turning away
Wait
Ill look
But he could not see
Ill strike a match
He secretly hoped it was too late to catch the train
She saw the glowing lantern of his hands as he cradled the light then his face lit up his eyes fixed on the watch
Instantly all was dark again
All was black before her eyes only a glowing match was red near her feet
Where was he
What is it
she asked afraid
You cant do it his voice answered out of the darkness
There was a pause
She felt in his power
She had heard the ring in his voice
It frightened her
What time is it
she asked quiet definite hopeless
Two minutes to nine he replied telling the truth with a struggle
And can I get from here to the station in fourteen minutes
No
At any rate She could distinguish his dark form again a yard or so away
She wanted to escape
But cant I do it
she pleaded
If you hurry he said brusquely
But you could easily walk it Clara its only seven miles to the tram
Ill come with you
No I want to catch the train
But why
I doI want to catch the train
Suddenly his voice altered
Very well he said dry and hard
Come along then
And he plunged ahead into the darkness
She ran after him wanting to cry
Now he was hard and cruel to her
She ran over the rough dark fields behind him out of breath ready to drop
But the double row of lights at the station drew nearer
Suddenly There she is
he cried breaking into a run
There was a faint rattling noise
Away to the right the train like a luminous caterpillar was threading across the night
The rattling ceased
Shes over the viaduct
Youll just do it
Clara ran quite out of breath and fell at last into the train
The whistle blew
He was gone
Goneand she was in a carriage full of people
She felt the cruelty of it
He turned round and plunged home
Before he knew where he was he was in the kitchen at home
He was very pale
His eyes were dark and dangerouslooking as if he were drunk
His mother looked at him
Well I must say your boots are in a nice state
she said
He looked at his feet
Then he took off his overcoat
His mother wondered if he were drunk
She caught the train then
she said
Yes
I hope HER feet werent so filthy
Where on earth you dragged her I dont know
He was silent and motionless for some time
Did you like her
he asked grudgingly at last
Yes I liked her
But youll tire of her my son you know you will
He did not answer
She noticed how he laboured in his breathing
Have you been running
she asked
We had to run for the train
Youll go and knock yourself up
Youd better drink hot milk
It was as good a stimulant as he could have but he refused and went to bed
There he lay face down on the counterpane and shed tears of rage and pain
There was a physical pain that made him bite his lips till they bled and the chaos inside him left him unable to think almost to feel
This is how she serves me is it
he said in his heart over and over pressing his face in the quilt
And he hated her
Again he went over the scene and again he hated her
The next day there was a new aloofness about him
Clara was very gentle almost loving
But he treated her distantly with a touch of contempt
She sighed continuing to be gentle
He came round
One evening of that week Sarah Bernhardt was at the Theatre Royal in Nottingham giving La Dame aux Camelias
Paul wanted to see this old and famous actress and he asked Clara to accompany him
He told his mother to leave the key in the window for him
Shall I book seats
he asked of Clara
Yes
And put on an evening suit will you
Ive never seen you in it
But good Lord Clara
Think of ME in evening suit at the theatre
he remonstrated
Would you rather not
she asked
I will if you WANT me to but I sll feel a fool
She laughed at him
Then feel a fool for my sake once wont you
The request made his blood flush up
I suppose I sll have to
What are you taking a suitcase for
his mother asked
He blushed furiously
Clara asked me he said
And what seats are you going in
Circlethreeandsix each
Well Im sure
exclaimed his mother sarcastically
Its only once in the bluest of blue moons he said
He dressed at Jordans put on an overcoat and a cap and met Clara in a cafe
She was with one of her suffragette friends
She wore an old long coat which did not suit her and had a little wrap over her head which he hated
The three went to the theatre together
Clara took off her coat on the stairs and he discovered she was in a sort of semievening dress that left her arms and neck and part of her breast bare
Her hair was done fashionably
The dress a simple thing of green crape suited her
She looked quite grand he thought
He could see her figure inside the frock as if that were wrapped closely round her
The firmness and the softness of her upright body could almost be felt as he looked at her
He clenched his fists
And he was to sit all the evening beside her beautiful naked arm watching the strong throat rise from the strong chest watching the breasts under the green stuff the curve of her limbs in the tight dress
Something in him hated her again for submitting him to this torture of nearness
And he loved her as she balanced her head and stared straight in front of her pouting wistful immobile as if she yielded herself to her fate because it was too strong for her
She could not help herself she was in the grip of something bigger than herself
A kind of eternal look about her as if she were a wistful sphinx made it necessary for him to kiss her
He dropped his programme and crouched down on the floor to get it so that he could kiss her hand and wrist
Her beauty was a torture to him
She sat immobile
Only when the lights went down she sank a little against him and he caressed her hand and arm with his fingers
He could smell her faint perfume
All the time his blood kept sweeping up in great whitehot waves that killed his consciousness momentarily
The drama continued
He saw it all in the distance going on somewhere he did not know where but it seemed far away inside him
He was Claras white heavy arms her throat her moving bosom
That seemed to be himself
Then away somewhere the play went on and he was identified with that also
There was no himself
The grey and black eyes of Clara her bosom coming down on him her arm that he held gripped between his hands were all that existed
Then he felt himself small and helpless her towering in her force above him
Only the intervals when the lights came up hurt him expressibly
He wanted to run anywhere so long as it would be dark again
In a maze he wandered out for a drink
Then the lights were out and the strange insane reality of Clara and the drama took hold of him again
The play went on
But he was obsessed by the desire to kiss the tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm
He could feel it
His whole face seemed suspended till he had put his lips there
It must be done
And the other people
At last he bent quickly forward and touched it with his lips
His moustache brushed the sensitive flesh
Clara shivered drew away her arm
When all was over the lights up the people clapping he came to himself and looked at his watch
His train was gone
I sll have to walk home
he said
Clara looked at him
It is too late
she asked
He nodded
Then he helped her on with her coat
I love you
You look beautiful in that dress he murmured over her shoulder among the throng of bustling people
She remained quiet
Together they went out of the theatre
He saw the cabs waiting the people passing
It seemed he met a pair of brown eyes which hated him
But he did not know
He and Clara turned away mechanically taking the direction to the station
The train had gone
He would have to walk the ten miles home
It doesnt matter he said
I shall enjoy it
Wont you she said flushing come home for the night
I can sleep with mother
He looked at her
Their eyes met
What will your mother say
he asked
She wont mind
Youre sure
Quite 
SHALL I come
If you will
Very well
And they turned away
At the first stoppingplace they took the car
The wind blew fresh in their faces
The town was dark the tram tipped in its haste
He sat with her hand fast in his
Will your mother be gone to bed
he asked
She may be
I hope not
They hurried along the silent dark little street the only people out of doors
Clara quickly entered the house
He hesitated
He leaped up the step and was in the room
Her mother appeared in the inner doorway large and hostile
Who have you got there
she asked
Its Mr Morel he has missed his train
I thought we might put him up for the night and save him a tenmile walk
Hm exclaimed Mrs Radford
Thats your lookout
If youve invited him hes very welcome as far as Im concerned
YOU keep the house
If you dont like me Ill go away again he said
Nay nay you neednt
Come along in
I dunno what youll think of the supper Id got her
It was a little dish of chip potatoes and a piece of bacon
The table was roughly laid for one
You can have some more bacon continued Mrs Radford
More chips you cant have
Its a shame to bother you he said
Oh dont you be apologetic
It doesnt DO wi me
You treated her to the theatre didnt you
There was a sarcasm in the last question
Well
laughed Paul uncomfortably
Well and whats an inch of bacon
Take your coat off
The big straightstanding woman was trying to estimate the situation
She moved about the cupboard
Clara took his coat
The room was very warm and cosy in the lamplight
My sirs
exclaimed Mrs Radford but you twos a pair of bright beauties I must say
Whats all that getup for
I believe we dont know he said feeling a victim
There isnt room in THIS house for two such bobbydazzlers if you fly your kites THAT high
she rallied them
It was a nasty thrust
He in his dinner jacket and Clara in her green dress and bare arms were confused
They felt they must shelter each other in that little kitchen
And look at THAT blossom 
continued Mrs Radford pointing to Clara
What does she reckon she did it for
Paul looked at Clara
She was rosy her neck was warm with blushes
There was a moment of silence
You like to see it dont you
he asked
The mother had them in her power
All the time his heart was beating hard and he was tight with anxiety
But he would fight her
Me like to see it
exclaimed the old woman
What should I like to see her make a fool of herself for
Ive seen people look bigger fools he said
Clara was under his protection now
Oh ay
and when was that
came the sarcastic rejoinder
When they made frights of themselves he answered
Mrs Radford large and threatening stood suspended on the hearthrug holding her fork
Theyre fools either road she answered at length turning to the Dutch oven
No he said fighting stoutly
Folk ought to look as well as they can
And do you call THAT looking nice
cried the mother pointing a scornful fork at Clara
Thatthat looks as if it wasnt properly dressed
I believe youre jealous that you cant swank as well he said laughing
Me
I could have worn evening dress with anybody if Id wanted to
came the scornful answer
And why didnt you want to
he asked pertinently
Or DID you wear it
There was a long pause
Mrs Radford readjusted the bacon in the Dutch oven
His heart beat fast for fear he had offended her
Me
she exclaimed at last
No I didnt
And when I was in service I knew as soon as one of the maids came out in bare shoulders what sort SHE was going to her sixpenny hop
Were you too good to go to a sixpenny hop
he said
Clara sat with bowed head
His eyes were dark and glittering
Mrs Radford took the Dutch oven from the fire and stood near him putting bits of bacon on his plate
THERES a nice crozzly bit
she said
Dont give me the best
he said
SHES got what SHE wants was the answer
There was a sort of scornful forbearance in the womans tone that made Paul know she was mollified
But DO have some
he said to Clara
She looked up at him with her grey eyes humiliated and lonely
No thanks
she said
Why wont you
he answered carelessly
The blood was beating up like fire in his veins
Mrs Radford sat down again large and impressive and aloof
He left Clara altogether to attend to the mother
They say Sarah Bernhardts fifty he said
Fifty
Shes turned sixty
came the scornful answer
Well he said youd never think it
She made me want to howl even now
I should like to see myself howling at THAT bad old baggage
said Mrs Radford
Its time she began to think herself a grandmother not a shrieking catamaran He laughed
A catamaran is a boat the Malays use he said
And its a word as I use she retorted
My mother does sometimes and its no good my telling her he said
I sd think she boxes your ears said Mrs Radford goodhumouredly
Shed like to and she says she will so I give her a little stool to stand on
Thats the worst of my mother said Clara
She never wants a stool for anything
But she often cant touch THAT lady with a long prop retorted Mrs Radford to Paul
I sd think she doesnt want touching with a prop he laughed
I shouldnt
It might do the pair of you good to give you a crack on the head with one said the mother laughing suddenly
Why are you so vindictive towards me
he said
Ive not stolen anything from you
No Ill watch that laughed the older woman
Soon the supper was finished
Mrs Radford sat guard in her chair
Paul lit a cigarette
Clara went upstairs returning with a sleepingsuit which she spread on the fender to air
Why Id forgot all about THEM
said Mrs Radford
Where have they sprung from
Out of my drawer
Hm
You bought em for Baxter an he wouldnt wear em would helaughing
Said he reckoned to do wiout trousers i bed
She turned confidentially to Paul saying He couldnt BEAR em them pyjama things
The young man sat making rings of smoke
Well its everyone to his taste he laughed
Then followed a little discussion of the merits of pyjamas
My mother loves me in them he said
She says Im a pierrot
I can imagine theyd suit you said Mrs Radford
After a while he glanced at the little clock that was ticking on the mantelpiece
It was halfpast twelve
It is funny he said but it takes hours to settle down to sleep after the theatre
Its about time you did said Mrs Radford clearing the table
Are YOU tired
he asked of Clara
Not the least bit she answered avoiding his eyes
Shall we have a game at cribbage
he said
Ive forgotten it
Well Ill teach you again
May we play crib Mrs
Radford
he asked
Youll please yourselves she said but its pretty late
A game or so will make us sleepy he answered
Clara brought the cards and sat spinning her weddingring whilst he shuffled them
Mrs Radford was washing up in the scullery
As it grew later Paul felt the situation getting more and more tense
Fifteen two fifteen four fifteen six and twos eight
The clock struck one
Still the game continued
Mrs Radford had done all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed had locked the door and filled the kettle
Still Paul went on dealing and counting
He was obsessed by Claras arms and throat
He believed he could see where the division was just beginning for her breasts
He could not leave her
She watched his hands and felt her joints melt as they moved quickly
She was so near it was almost as if he touched her and yet not quite
His mettle was roused
He hated Mrs Radford
She sat on nearly dropping asleep but determined and obstinate in her chair
Paul glanced at her then at Clara
She met his eyes that were angry mocking and hard as steel
Her own answered him in shame
He knew SHE at any rate was of his mind
He played on
At last Mrs Radford roused herself stiffly and said Isnt it nigh on time you two was thinking o bed
Paul played on without answering
He hated her sufficiently to murder her
Half a minute he said
The elder woman rose and sailed stubbornly into the scullery returning with his candle which she put on the mantelpiece
Then she sat down again
The hatred of her went so hot down his veins he dropped his cards
Well stop then he said but his voice was still a challenge
Clara saw his mouth shut hard
Again he glanced at her
It seemed like an agreement
She bent over the cards coughing to clear her throat
Well Im glad youve finished said Mrs Radford
Here take your thingsshe thrust the warm suit in his handand this is your candle
Your rooms over this theres only two so you cant go far wrong
Well goodnight
I hope youll rest well
Im sure I shall I always do he said
Yes and so you ought at your age she replied
He bade goodnight to Clara and went
The twisting stairs of white scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step
He went doggedly
The two doors faced each other
He went in his room pushed the door to without fastening the latch
It was a small room with a large bed
Some of Claras hairpins were on the dressingtableher hairbrush
Her clothes and some skirts hung under a cloth in a corner
There was actually a pair of stockings over a chair
He explored the room
Two books of his own were there on the shelf
He undressed folded his suit and sat on the bed listening
Then he blew out the candle lay down and in two minutes was almost asleep
Then clickhe was wide awake and writhing in torment
It was as if when he had nearly got to sleep something had bitten him suddenly and sent him mad
He sat up and looked at the room in the darkness his feet doubled under him perfectly motionless listening
He heard a cat somewhere away outside then the heavy poised tread of the mother then Claras distinct voice Will you unfasten my dress
There was silence for some time
At last the mother said Now then
arent you coming up
No not yet replied the daughter calmly
Oh very well then
If its not late enough stop a bit longer
Only you neednt come waking me up when Ive got to sleep
I shant be long said Clara
Immediately afterwards Paul heard the mother slowly mounting the stairs
The candlelight flashed through the cracks in his door
Her dress brushed the door and his heart jumped
Then it was dark and he heard the clatter of her latch
She was very leisurely indeed in her preparations for sleep
After a long time it was quite still
He sat strung up on the bed shivering slightly
His door was an inch open
As Clara came upstairs he would intercept her
He waited
All was dead silence
The clock struck two
Then he heard a slight scrape of the fender downstairs
Now he could not help himself
His shivering was uncontrollable
He felt he must go or die
He stepped off the bed and stood a moment shuddering
Then he went straight to the door
He tried to step lightly
The first stair cracked like a shot
He listened
The old woman stirred in her bed
The staircase was dark
There was a slit of light under the stairfoot door which opened into the kitchen
He stood a moment
Then he went on mechanically
Every step creaked and his back was creeping lest the old womans door should open behind him up above
He fumbled with the door at the bottom
The latch opened with a loud clack
He went through into the kitchen and shut the door noisily behind him
The old woman darent come now
Then he stood arrested
Clara was kneeling on a pile of white underclothing on the hearthrug her back towards him warming herself
She did not look round but sat crouching on her heels and her rounded beautiful back was towards him and her face was hidden
She was warming her body at the fire for consolation
The glow was rosy on one side the shadow was dark and warm on the other
Her arms hung slack
He shuddered violently clenching his teeth and fists hard to keep control
Then he went forward to her
He put one hand on her shoulder the fingers of the other hand under her chin to raise her face
A convulsed shiver ran through her once twice at his touch
She kept her head bent
Sorry
he murmured realising that his hands were very cold
Then she looked up at him frightened like a thing that is afraid of death
My hands are so cold he murmured
I like it she whispered closing her eyes
The breath of her words were on his mouth
Her arms clasped his knees
The cord of his sleepingsuit dangled against her and made her shiver
As the warmth went into him his shuddering became less
At length unable to stand so any more he raised her and she buried her head on his shoulder
His hands went over her slowly with an infinite tenderness of caress
She clung close to him trying to hide herself against him
He clasped her very fast
Then at last she looked at him mute imploring looking to see if she must be ashamed
His eyes were dark very deep and very quiet
It was as if her beauty and his taking it hurt him made him sorrowful
He looked at her with a little pain and was afraid
He was so humble before her
She kissed him fervently on the eyes first one then the other and she folded herself to him
She gave herself
He held her fast
It was a moment intense almost to agony
She stood letting him adore her and tremble with joy of her
It healed her hurt pride
It healed her it made her glad
It made her feel erect and proud again
Her pride had been wounded inside her
She had been cheapened
Now she radiated with joy and pride again
It was her restoration and her recognition
Then he looked at her his face radiant
They laughed to each other and he strained her to his chest
The seconds ticked off the minutes passed and still the two stood clasped rigid together mouth to mouth like a statue in one block
But again his fingers went seeking over her restless wandering dissatisfied
The hot blood came up wave upon wave
She laid her head on his shoulder
Come you to my room he murmured
She looked at him and shook her head her mouth pouting disconsolately her eyes heavy with passion
He watched her fixedly
Yes
he said
Again she shook her head
Why not
he asked
She looked at him still heavily sorrowfully and again she shook her head
His eyes hardened and he gave way
When later on he was back in bed he wondered why she had refused to come to him openly so that her mother would know
At any rate then things would have been definite
And she could have stayed with him the night without having to go as she was to her mothers bed
It was strange and he could not understand it
And then almost immediately he fell asleep
He awoke in the morning with someone speaking to him
Opening his eyes he saw Mrs Radford big and stately looking down on him
She held a cup of tea in her hand
Do you think youre going to sleep till Doomsday
she said
He laughed at once
It ought only to be about five oclock he said
Well she answered its halfpast seven whether or not
Here Ive brought you a cup of tea
He rubbed his face pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead and roused himself
Whats it so late for
he grumbled
He resented being wakened
It amused her
She saw his neck in the flannel sleepingjacket as white and round as a girls
He rubbed his hair crossly
Its no good your scratching your head she said
It wont make it no earlier
Here an how long dyou think Im going to stand waiting wi this here cup
Oh dash the cup
he said
You should go to bed earlier said the woman
He looked up at her laughing with impudence
I went to bed before YOU did he said
Yes my Guyney you did
she exclaimed
Fancy he said stirring his tea having tea brought to bed to me
My motherll think Im ruined for life
Dont she never do it
asked Mrs Radford
Shed as leave think of flying
Ah I always spoilt my lot
Thats why theyve turned out such bad uns said the elderly woman
Youd only Clara he said
And Mr Radfords in heaven
So I suppose theres only you left to be the bad un
Im not bad Im only soft she said as she went out of the bedroom
Im only a fool I am
Clara was very quiet at breakfast but she had a sort of air of proprietorship over him that pleased him infinitely
Mrs Radford was evidently fond of him
He began to talk of his painting
Whats the good exclaimed the mother of your whittling and worrying and twistin and tooin at that painting of yours
What GOOD does it do you I should like to know
Youd better be enjoyin yourself
Oh but exclaimed Paul I made over thirty guineas last year
Did you
Well thats a consideration but its nothing to the time you put in
And Ive got four pounds owing
A man said hed give me five pounds if Id paint him and his missis and the dog and the cottage
And I went and put the fowls in instead of the dog and he was waxy so I had to knock a quid off
I was sick of it and I didnt like the dog
I made a picture of it
What shall I do when he pays me the four pounds
Nay
you know your own uses for your money said Mrs Radford
But Im going to bust this four pounds
Should we go to the seaside for a day or two
Who
You and Clara and me
What on your money
she exclaimed halfwrathful
Why not
YOU wouldnt be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle race
she said
So long as I get a good run for my money
Will you
Nay you may settle that atween you
And youre willing
he asked amazed and rejoicing
Youll do as you like said Mrs Radford whether Im willing or not
CHAPTER XIII BAXTER DAWES SOON after Paul had been to the theatre with Clara he was drinking in the Punch Bowl with some friends of his when Dawes came in
Claras husband was growing stout his eyelids were getting slack over his brown eyes he was losing his healthy firmness of flesh
He was very evidently on the downward track
Having quarrelled with his sister he had gone into cheap lodgings
His mistress had left him for a man who would marry her
He had been in prison one night for fighting when he was drunk and there was a shady betting episode in which he was concerned
Paul and he were confirmed enemies and yet there was between them that peculiar feeling of intimacy as if they were secretly near to each other which sometimes exists between two people although they never speak to one another
Paul often thought of Baxter Dawes often wanted to get at him and be friends with him
He knew that Dawes often thought about him and that the man was drawn to him by some bond or other
And yet the two never looked at each other save in hostility
Since he was a superior employee at Jordans it was the thing for Paul to offer Dawes a drink
Whatll you have
he asked of him
Nowt wi a bleeder like you
replied the man
Paul turned away with a slight disdainful movement of the shoulders very irritating
The aristocracy he continued is really a military institution
Take Germany now
Shes got thousands of aristocrats whose only means of existence is the army
Theyre deadly poor and lifes deadly slow
So they hope for a war
They look for war as a chance of getting on
Till theres a war they are idle goodfornothings
When theres a war they are leaders and commanders
There you are thenthey WANT war
He was not a favourite debater in the publichouse being too quick and overbearing
He irritated the older men by his assertive manner and his cocksureness
They listened in silence and were not sorry when he finished
Dawes interrupted the young mans flow of eloquence by asking in a loud sneer Did you learn all that at th theatre th other night
Paul looked at him their eyes met
Then he knew Dawes had seen him coming out of the theatre with Clara
Why what about th theatre
asked one of Pauls associates glad to get a dig at the young fellow and sniffing something tasty
Oh him in a bobtailed evening suit on the lardyda
sneered Dawes jerking his head contemptuously at Paul
Thats comin it strong said the mutual friend
Tart an all
Tart begod
said Dawes
Go on lets have it
cried the mutual friend
Youve got it said Dawes an I reckon Morelly had it an all
Well Ill be jiggered
said the mutual friend
An was it a proper tart
Tart God blimeyyes
How do you know
Oh said Dawes I reckon he spent th night There was a good deal of laughter at Pauls expense
But who WAS she
Dyou know her
asked the mutual friend
I should SHAY SHO said Dawes
This brought another burst of laughter
Then spit it out said the mutual friend
Dawes shook his head and took a gulp of beer
Its a wonder he hasnt let on himself he said
Hell be braggin of it in a bit
Come on Paul said the friend its no good
You might just as well own up
Own up what
That I happened to take a friend to the theatre
Oh well if it was all right tell us who she was lad said the friend
She WAS all right said Dawes
Paul was furious
Dawes wiped his golden moustache with his fingers sneering
Strike me
One o that sort
said the mutual friend
Paul boy Im surprised at you
And do you know her Baxter
Just a bit like
He winked at the other men
Oh well said Paul Ill be going
The mutual friend laid a detaining hand on his shoulder
Nay he said you dont get off as easy as that my lad
Weve got to have a full account of this business
Then get it from Dawes
he said
You shouldnt funk your own deeds man remonstrated the friend
Then Dawes made a remark which caused Paul to throw half a glass of beer in his face
Oh Mr
Morel
cried the barmaid and she rang the bell for the chuckerout
Dawes spat and rushed for the young man
At that minute a brawny fellow with his shirtsleeves rolled up and his trousers tight over his haunches intervened
Now then
he said pushing his chest in front of Dawes
Come out
cried Dawes
Paul was leaning white and quivering against the brass rail of the bar
He hated Dawes wished something could exterminate him at that minute and at the same time seeing the wet hair on the mans forehead he thought he looked pathetic
He did not move
Come out you  said Dawes
Thats enough Dawes cried the barmaid
Come on said the chuckerout with kindly insistence youd better be getting on
And by making Dawes edge away from his own close proximity he worked him to the door
THATS the little sod as started it
cried Dawes halfcowed pointing to Paul Morel
Why what a story Mr
Dawes
said the barmaid
You know it was you all the time
Still the chuckerout kept thrusting his chest forward at him still he kept edging back until he was in the doorway and on the steps outside then he turned round
All right he said nodding straight at his rival
Paul had a curious sensation of pity almost of affection mingled with violent hate for the man
The coloured door swung to there was silence in the bar
Serve him jolly well right
said the barmaid
But its a nasty thing to get a glass of beer in your eyes said the mutual friend
I tell you I was glad he did said the barmaid
Will you have another Mr
Morel
She held up Pauls glass questioningly
He nodded
Hes a man as doesnt care for anything is Baxter Dawes said one
Pooh
is he
said the barmaid
Hes a loudmouthed one he is and theyre never much good
Give me a pleasantspoken chap if you want a devil
Well Paul my lad said the friend youll have to take care of yourself now for a while
You wont have to give him a chance over you thats all said the barmaid
Can you box
asked a friend
Not a bit he answered still very white
I might give you a turn or two said the friend
Thanks I havent time
And presently he took his departure
Go along with him Mr Jenkinson whispered the barmaid tipping Mr Jenkinson the wink
The man nodded took his hat said Goodnight all
very heartily and followed Paul calling Half a minute old man
You an mes going the same road I believe
Mr Morel doesnt like it said the barmaid
Youll see we shant have him in much more
Im sorry hes good company
And Baxter Dawes wants locking up thats what he wants
Paul would have died rather than his mother should get to know of this affair
He suffered tortures of humiliation and selfconsciousness
There was now a good deal of his life of which necessarily he could not speak to his mother
He had a life apart from herhis sexual life
The rest she still kept
But he felt he had to conceal something from her and it irked him
There was a certain silence between them and he felt he had in that silence to defend himself against her he felt condemned by her
Then sometimes he hated her and pulled at her bondage
His life wanted to free itself of her
It was like a circle where life turned back on itself and got no farther
She bore him loved him kept him and his love turned back into her so that he could not be free to go forward with his own life really love another woman
At this period unknowingly he resisted his mothers influence
He did not tell her things there was a distance between them
Clara was happy almost sure of him
She felt she had at last got him for herself and then again came the uncertainty
He told her jestingly of the affair with her husband
Her colour came up her grey eyes flashed
Thats him to a T she criedlike a navvy
Hes not fit for mixing with decent folk
Yet you married him he said
It made her furious that he reminded her
I did
she cried
But how was I to know
I think he might have been rather nice he said
You think I made him what he is
she exclaimed
Oh no
he made himself
But theres something about him Clara looked at her lover closely
There was something in him she hated a sort of detached criticism of herself a coldness which made her womans soul harden against him
And what are you going to do
she asked
How
About Baxter
Theres nothing to do is there
he replied
You can fight him if you have to I suppose
she said
No I havent the least sense of the fist
Its funny
With most men theres the instinct to clench the fist and hit
Its not so with me
I should want a knife or a pistol or something to fight with
Then youd better carry something she said
Nay he laughed Im not daggeroso
But hell do something to you
You dont know him
All right he said well see
And youll let him
Perhaps if I cant help it
And if he kills you
she said
I should be sorry for his sake and mine
Clara was silent for a moment
You DO make me angry
she exclaimed
Thats nothing afresh he laughed
But why are you so silly
You dont know him
And dont want
Yes but youre not going to let a man do as he likes with you
What must I do
he replied laughing
I should carry a revolver she said
Im sure hes dangerous
I might blow my fingers off he said
No but wont you
she pleaded
No
Not anything
No
And youll leave him to
Yes
You are a fool
Fact
She set her teeth with anger
I could SHAKE you
she cried trembling with passion
Why
Let a man like HIM do as he likes with you
You can go back to him if he triumphs he said
Do you want me to hate you
she asked
Well I only tell you he said
And YOU say you LOVE me
she exclaimed low and indignant
Ought I to slay him to please you
he said
But if I did see what a hold hed have over me
Do you think Im a fool
she exclaimed
Not at all
But you dont understand me my dear
There was a pause between them
But you ought NOT to expose yourself she pleaded
He shrugged his shoulders
The man in righteousness arrayed The pure and blameless liver Needs not the keen Toledo blade Nor venomfreighted quiver he quoted
She looked at him searchingly
I wish I could understand you she said
Theres simply nothing to understand he laughed
She bowed her head brooding
He did not see Dawes for several days then one morning as he ran upstairs from the Spiral room he almost collided with the burly metalworker
What the
cried the smith
Sorry
said Paul and passed on
SORRY
sneered Dawes
Paul whistled lightly Put Me among the Girls
Ill stop your whistle my jockey
he said
The other took no notice
Youre goin to answer for that job of the other night
Paul went to his desk in his corner and turned over the leaves of the ledger
Go and tell Fanny I want order 097 quick
he said to his boy
Dawes stood in the doorway tall and threatening looking at the top of the young mans head
Six and fives eleven and sevens oneandsix Paul added aloud
An you hear do you
said Dawes
FIVE AND NINEPENCE
He wrote a figure
Whats that
he said
Im going to show you what it is said the smith
The other went on adding the figures aloud
Yer crawlin little  yer daresnt face me proper
Paul quickly snatched the heavy ruler
Dawes started
The young man ruled some lines in his ledger
The elder man was infuriated
But wait till I light on you no matter where it is Ill settle your hash for a bit yer little swine
All right said Paul
At that the smith started heavily from the doorway
Just then a whistle piped shrilly
Paul went to the speakingtube
Yes
he said and he listened
Eryes
He listened then he laughed
Ill come down directly
Ive got a visitor just now
Dawes knew from his tone that he had been speaking to Clara
He stepped forward
Yer little devil
he said
Ill visitor you inside of two minutes
Think Im goin to have YOU whippertysnappin round
The other clerks in the warehouse looked up
Pauls officeboy appeared holding some white article
Fanny says you could have had it last night if youd let her know he said
All right answered Paul looking at the stocking
Get it off
Dawes stood frustrated helpless with rage
Morel turned round
Excuse me a minute he said to Dawes and he would have run downstairs
By God Ill stop your gallop
shouted the smith seizing him by the arm
He turned quickly
Hey
Hey
cried the officeboy alarmed
Thomas Jordan started out of his little glass office and came running down the room
Whats amatter whats amatter
he said in his old mans sharp voice
Im just goin ter settle this little  thats all said Dawes desperately
What do you mean
snapped Thomas Jordan
What I say said Dawes but he hung fire
Morel was leaning against the counter ashamed halfgrinning
Whats it all about
snapped Thomas Jordan
Couldnt say said Paul shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders
Couldnt yer couldnt yer
cried Dawes thrusting forward his handsome furious face and squaring his fist
Have you finished
cried the old man strutting
Get off about your business and dont come here tipsy in the morning
Dawes turned his big frame slowly upon him
Tipsy
he said
Whos tipsy
Im no more tipsy than YOU are
Weve heard that song before snapped the old man
Now you get off and dont be long about it
Comin HERE with your rowdying
The smith looked down contemptuously on his employer
His hands large and grimy and yet well shaped for his labour worked restlessly
Paul remembered they were the hands of Claras husband and a flash of hate went through him
Get out before youre turned out
snapped Thomas Jordan
Why wholl turn me out
said Dawes beginning to sneer
Mr Jordan started marched up to the smith waving him off thrusting his stout little figure at the man saying Get off my premisesget off
He seized and twitched Dawess arm
Come off
said the smith and with a jerk of the elbow he sent the little manufacturer staggering backwards
Before anyone could help him Thomas Jordan had collided with the flimsy springdoor
It had given way and let him crash down the halfdozen steps into Fannys room
There was a second of amazement then men and girls were running
Dawes stood a moment looking bitterly on the scene then he took his departure
Thomas Jordan was shaken and braised not otherwise hurt
He was however beside himself with rage
He dismissed Dawes from his employment and summoned him for assault
At the trial Paul Morel had to give evidence
Asked how the trouble began he said Dawes took occasion to insult Mrs Dawes and me because I accompanied her to the theatre one evening then I threw some beer at him and he wanted his revenge
Cherchez la femme
smiled the magistrate
The case was dismissed after the magistrate had told Dawes he thought him a skunk
You gave the case away snapped Mr Jordan to Paul
I dont think I did replied the latter
Besides you didnt really want a conviction did you
What do you think I took the case up for
Well said Paul Im sorry if I said the wrong thing
Clara was also very angry
Why need MY name have been dragged in
she said
Better speak it openly than leave it to be whispered
There was no need for anything at all she declared
We are none the poorer he said indifferently
YOU may not be she said
And you
he asked
I need never have been mentioned
Im sorry he said but he did not sound sorry
He told himself easily She will come round
And she did
He told his mother about the fall of Mr Jordan and the trial of Dawes
Mrs Morel watched him closely
And what do you think of it all
she asked him
I think hes a fool he said
But he was very uncomfortable nevertheless
Have you ever considered where it will end
his mother said
No he answered things work out of themselves
They do in a way one doesnt like as a rule said his mother
And then one has to put up with them he said
Youll find youre not as good at putting up as you imagine she said
He went on working rapidly at his design
Do you ever ask HER opinion
she said at length
What of
Of you and the whole thing
I dont care what her opinion of me is
Shes fearfully in love with me but its not very deep
But quite as deep as your feeling for her
He looked up at his mother curiously
Yes he said
You know mother I think there must be something the matter with me that I CANT love
When shes there as a rule I DO love her
Sometimes when I see her just as THE WOMAN I love her mother but then when she talks and criticises I often dont listen to her
Yet shes as much sense as Miriam
Perhaps and I love her better than Miriam
But WHY dont they hold me
The last question was almost a lamentation
His mother turned away her face sat looking across the room very quiet grave with something of renunciation
But you wouldnt want to marry Clara
she said
No at first perhaps I would
But whywhy dont I want to marry her or anybody
I feel sometimes as if I wronged my women mother
How wronged them my son
I dont know
He went on painting rather despairingly he had touched the quick of the trouble
And as for wanting to marry said his mother theres plenty of time yet
But no mother
I even love Clara and I did Miriam but to GIVE myself to them in marriage I couldnt
I couldnt belong to them
They seem to want ME and I cant ever give it them
You havent met the right woman
And I never shall meet the right woman while you live he said
She was very quiet
Now she began to feel again tired as if she were done
Well see my son she answered
The feeling that things were going in a circle made him mad
Clara was indeed passionately in love with him and he with her as far as passion went
In the daytime he forgot her a good deal
She was working in the same building but he was not aware of it
He was busy and her existence was of no matter to him
But all the time she was in her Spiral room she had a sense that he was upstairs a physical sense of his person in the same building
Every second she expected him to come through the door and when he came it was a shock to her
But he was often short and offhand with her
He gave her his directions in an official manner keeping her at bay
With what wits she had left she listened to him
She dared not misunderstand or fail to remember but it was a cruelty to her
She wanted to touch his chest
She knew exactly how his breast was shapen under the waistcoat and she wanted to touch it
It maddened her to hear his mechanical voice giving orders about the work
She wanted to break through the sham of it smash the trivial coating of business which covered him with hardness get at the man again but she was afraid and before she could feel one touch of his warmth he was gone and she ached again
He knew that she was dreary every evening she did not see him so he gave her a good deal of his time
The days were often a misery to her but the evenings and the nights were usually a bliss to them both
Then they were silent
For hours they sat together or walked together in the dark and talked only a few almost meaningless words
But he had her hand in his and her bosom left its warmth in his chest making him feel whole
One evening they were walking down by the canal and something was troubling him
She knew she had not got him
All the time he whistled softly and persistently to himself
She listened feeling she could learn more from his whistling than from his speech
It was a sad dissatisfied tunea tune that made her feel he would not stay with her
She walked on in silence
When they came to the swing bridge he sat down on the great pole looking at the stars in the water
He was a long way from her
She had been thinking
Will you always stay at Jordans
she asked
No he answered without reflecting
No I sll leave Nottingham and go abroadsoon
Go abroad
What for
I dunno
I feel restless
But what shall you do
I shall have to get some steady designing work and some sort of sale for my pictures first he said
I am gradually making my way
I know I am
And when do you think youll go
I dont know
I shall hardly go for long while theres my mother
You couldnt leave her
Not for long
She looked at the stars in the black water
They lay very white and staring
It was an agony to know he would leave her but it was almost an agony to have him near her
And if you made a nice lot of money what would you do
she asked
Go somewhere in a pretty house near London with my mother
I see
There was a long pause
I could still come and see you he said
I dont know
Dont ask me what I should do I dont know
There was a silence
The stars shuddered and broke upon the water
There came a breath of wind
He went suddenly to her and put his hand on her shoulder
Dont ask me anything about the future he said miserably
I dont know anything
Be with me now will you no matter what it is
And she took him in her arms
After all she was a married woman and she had no right even to what he gave her
He needed her badly
She had him in her arms and he was miserable
With her warmth she folded him over consoled him loved him
She would let the moment stand for itself
After a moment he lifted his head as if he wanted to speak
Clara he said struggling
She caught him passionately to her pressed his head down on her breast with her hand
She could not bear the suffering in his voice
She was afraid in her soul
He might have anything of heranything but she did not want to KNOW
She felt she could not bear it
She wanted him to be soothed upon hersoothed
She stood clasping him and caressing him and he was something unknown to hersomething almost uncanny
She wanted to soothe him into forgetfulness
And soon the struggle went down in his soul and he forgot
But then Clara was not there for him only a woman warm something he loved and almost worshipped there in the dark
But it was not Clara and she submitted to him
The naked hunger and inevitability of his loving her something strong and blind and ruthless in its primitiveness made the hour almost terrible to her
She knew how stark and alone he was and she felt it was great that he came to her and she took him simply because his need was bigger either than her or him and her soul was still within her
She did this for him in his need even if he left her for she loved him
All the while the peewits were screaming in the field
When he came to he wondered what was near his eyes curving and strong with life in the dark and what voice it was speaking
Then he realised it was the grass and the peewit was calling
The warmth was Claras breathing heaving
He lifted his head and looked into her eyes
They were dark and shining and strange life wild at the source staring into his life stranger to him yet meeting him and he put his face down on her throat afraid
What was she
A strong strange wild life that breathed with his in the darkness through this hour
It was all so much bigger than themselves that he was hushed
They had met and included in their meeting the thrust of the manifold grass stems the cry of the peewit the wheel of the stars
When they stood up they saw other lovers stealing down the opposite hedge
It seemed natural they were there the night contained them
And after such an evening they both were very still having known the immensity of passion
They felt small halfafraid childish and wondering like Adam and Eve when they lost their innocence and realised the magnificence of the power which drove them out of Paradise and across the great night and the great day of humanity
It was for each of them an initiation and a satisfaction
To know their own nothingness to know the tremendous living flood which carried them always gave them rest within themselves
If so great a magnificent power could overwhelm them identify them altogether with itself so that they knew they were only grains in the tremendous heave that lifted every grass blade its little height and every tree and living thing then why fret about themselves
They could let themselves be carried by life and they felt a sort of peace each in the other
There was a verification which they had had together
Nothing could nullify it nothing could take it away it was almost their belief in life
But Clara was not satisfied
Something great was there she knew something great enveloped her
But it did not keep her
In the morning it was not the same
They had KNOWN but she could not keep the moment
She wanted it again she wanted something permanent
She had not realised fully
She thought it was he whom she wanted
He was not safe to her
This that had been between them might never be again he might leave her
She had not got him she was not satisfied
She had been there but she had not gripped thethe somethingshe knew not whatwhich she was mad to have
In the morning he had considerable peace and was happy in himself
It seemed almost as if he had known the baptism of fire in passion and it left him at rest
But it was not Clara
It was something that happened because of her but it was not her
They were scarcely any nearer each other
It was as if they had been blind agents of a great force
When she saw him that day at the factory her heart melted like a drop of fire
It was his body his brows
The drop of fire grew more intense in her breast she must hold him
But he very quiet very subdued this morning went on giving his instruction
She followed him into the dark ugly basement and lifted her arms to him
He kissed her and the intensity of passion began to burn him again
Somebody was at the door
He ran upstairs she returned to her room moving as if in a trance
After that the fire slowly went down
He felt more and more that his experience had been impersonal and not Clara
He loved her
There was a big tenderness as after a strong emotion they had known together but it was not she who could keep his soul steady
He had wanted her to be something she could not be
And she was mad with desire of him
She could not see him without touching him
In the factory as he talked to her about Spiral hose she ran her hand secretly along his side
She followed him out into the basement for a quick kiss her eyes always mute and yearning full of unrestrained passion she kept fixed on his
He was afraid of her lest she should too flagrantly give herself away before the other girls
She invariably waited for him at dinnertime for him to embrace her before she went
He felt as if she were helpless almost a burden to him and it irritated him
But what do you always want to be kissing and embracing for
he said
Surely theres a time for everything
She looked up at him and the hate came into her eyes
DO I always want to be kissing you
she said
Always even if I come to ask you about the work
I dont want anything to do with love when Im at work
Works work And what is love
she asked
Has it to have special hours
Yes out of work hours
And youll regulate it according to Mr Jordans closing time
Yes and according to the freedom from business of any sort
It is only to exist in spare time
Thats all and not always thennot the kissing sort of love
And thats all you think of it
Its quite enough
Im glad you think so
And she was cold to him for some timeshe hated him and while she was cold and contemptuous he was uneasy till she had forgiven him again
But when they started afresh they were not any nearer
He kept her because he never satisfied her
In the spring they went together to the seaside
They had rooms at a little cottage near Theddlethorpe and lived as man and wife
Mrs Radford sometimes went with them
It was known in Nottingham that Paul Morel and Mrs Dawes were going together but as nothing was very obvious and Clara always a solitary person and he seemed so simple and innocent it did not make much difference
He loved the Lincolnshire coast and she loved the sea
In the early morning they often went out together to bathe
The grey of the dawn the far desolate reaches of the fenland smitten with winter the seameadows rank with herbage were stark enough to rejoice his soul
As they stepped on to the highroad from their plank bridge and looked round at the endless monotony of levels the land a little darker than the sky the sea sounding small beyond the sandhills his heart filled strong with the sweeping relentlessness of life
She loved him then
He was solitary and strong and his eyes had a beautiful light
They shuddered with cold then he raced her down the road to the green turf bridge
She could run well
Her colour soon came her throat was bare her eyes shone
He loved her for being so luxuriously heavy and yet so quick
Himself was light she went with a beautiful rush
They grew warm and walked hand in hand
A flush came into the sky the wan moon halfway down the west sank into insignificance
On the shadowy land things began to take life plants with great leaves became distinct
They came through a pass in the big cold sandhills on to the beach
The long waste of foreshore lay moaning under the dawn and the sea the ocean was a flat dark strip with a white edge
Over the gloomy sea the sky grew red
Quickly the fire spread among the clouds and scattered them
Crimson burned to orange orange to dull gold and in a golden glitter the sun came up dribbling fierily over the waves in little splashes as if someone had gone along and the light had spilled from her pail as she walked
The breakers ran down the shore in long hoarse strokes
Tiny seagulls like specks of spray wheeled above the line of surf
Their crying seemed larger than they
Far away the coast reached out and melted into the morning the tussocky sandhills seemed to sink to a level with the beach
Mablethorpe was tiny on their right
They had alone the space of all this level shore the sea and the upcoming sun the faint noise of the waters the sharp crying of the gulls
They had a warm hollow in the sandhills where the wind did not come
He stood looking out to sea
Its very fine he said
Now dont get sentimental she said
It irritated her to see him standing gazing at the sea like a solitary and poetic person
He laughed
She quickly undressed
There are some fine waves this morning she said triumphantly
She was a better swimmer than he he stood idly watching her
Arent you coming
she said
In a minute he answered
She was white and velvet skinned with heavy shoulders
A little wind coming from the sea blew across her body and ruffled her hair
The morning was of a lovely limpid gold colour
Veils of shadow seemed to be drifting away on the north and the south
Clara stood shrinking slightly from the touch of the wind twisting her hair
The seagrass rose behind the white stripped woman
She glanced at the sea then looked at him
He was watching her with dark eyes which she loved and could not understand
She hugged her breasts between her arms cringing laughing Oo it will be so cold
she said
He bent forward and kissed her held her suddenly close and kissed her again
She stood waiting
He looked into her eyes then away at the pale sands
Go then
he said quietly
She flung her arms round his neck drew him against her kissed him passionately and went saying But youll come in
In a minute
She went plodding heavily over the sand that was soft as velvet
He on the sandhills watched the great pale coast envelop her
She grew smaller lost proportion seemed only like a large white bird toiling forward
Not much more than a big white pebble on the beach not much more than a clot of foam being blown and rolled over the sand he said to himself
She seemed to move very slowly across the vast sounding shore
As he watched he lost her
She was dazzled out of sight by the sunshine
Again he saw her the merest white speck moving against the white muttering seaedge
Look how little she is
he said to himself
Shes lost like a grain of sand in the beachjust a concentrated speck blown along a tiny white foambubble almost nothing among the morning
Why does she absorb me
The morning was altogether uninterrupted she was gone in the water
Far and wide the beach the sandhills with their blue marrain the shining water glowed together in immense unbroken solitude
What is she after all
he said to himself
Heres the seacoast morning big and permanent and beautiful there is she fretting always unsatisfied and temporary as a bubble of foam
What does she mean to me after all
She represents something like a bubble of foam represents the sea
But what is she
Its not her I care for
Then startled by his own unconscious thoughts that seemed to speak so distinctly that all the morning could hear he undressed and ran quickly down the sands
She was watching for him
Her arm flashed up to him she heaved on a wave subsided her shoulders in a pool of liquid silver
He jumped through the breakers and in a moment her hand was on his shoulder
He was a poor swimmer and could not stay long in the water
She played round him in triumph sporting with her superiority which he begrudged her
The sunshine stood deep and fine on the water
They laughed in the sea for a minute or two then raced each other back to the sandhills
When they were drying themselves panting heavily he watched her laughing breathless face her bright shoulders her breasts that swayed and made him frightened as she rubbed them and he thought again But she is magnificent and even bigger than the morning and the sea
Is she
Is she She seeing his dark eyes fixed on her broke off from her drying with a laugh
What are you looking at
she said
You he answered laughing
Her eyes met his and in a moment he was kissing her white goosefleshed shoulder and thinking What is she
What is she
She loved him in the morning
There was something detached hard and elemental about his kisses then as if he were only conscious of his own will not in the least of her and her wanting him
Later in the day he went out sketching
You he said to her go with your mother to Sutton
I am so dull
She stood and looked at him
He knew she wanted to come with him but he preferred to be alone
She made him feel imprisoned when she was there as if he could not get a free deep breath as if there were something on top of him
She felt his desire to be free of her
In the evening he came back to her
They walked down the shore in the darkness then sat for a while in the shelter of the sandhills
It seems she said as they stared over the darkness of the sea where no light was to be seenit seemed as if you only loved me at nightas if you didnt love me in the daytime
He ran the cold sand through his fingers feeling guilty under the accusation
The night is free to you he replied
In the daytime I want to be by myself
But why
she said
Why even now when we are on this short holiday
I dont know
Lovemaking stifles me in the daytime
But it neednt be always lovemaking she said
It always is he answered when you and I are together
She sat feeling very bitter
Do you ever want to marry me
he asked curiously
Do you me
she replied
Yes yes I should like us to have children he answered slowly
She sat with her head bent fingering the sand
But you dont really want a divorce from Baxter do you
he said
It was some minutes before she replied
No she said very deliberately I dont think I do
Why
I dont know
Do you feel as if you belonged to him
No I dont think so
What then
I think he belongs to me she replied
He was silent for some minutes listening to the wind blowing over the hoarse dark sea
And you never really intended to belong to ME
he said
Yes I do belong to you she answered
No he said because you dont want to be divorced
It was a knot they could not untie so they left it took what they could get and what they could not attain they ignored
I consider you treated Baxter rottenly he said another time
He halfexpected Clara to answer him as his mother would You consider your own affairs and dont know so much about other peoples
But she took him seriously almost to his own surprise
Why
she said
I suppose you thought he was a lily of the valley and so you put him in an appropriate pot and tended him according
You made up your mind he was a lily of the valley and it was no good his being a cowparsnip
You wouldnt have it
I certainly never imagined him a lily of the valley
You imagined him something he wasnt
Thats just what a woman is
She thinks she knows whats good for a man and shes going to see he gets it and no matter if hes starving he may sit and whistle for what he needs while shes got him and is giving him whats good for him
And what are you doing
she asked
Im thinking what tune I shall whistle he laughed
And instead of boxing his ears she considered him in earnest
You think I want to give you whats good for you
she asked
I hope so but love should give a sense of freedom not of prison
Miriam made me feel tied up like a donkey to a stake
I must feed on her patch and nowhere else
Its sickening
And would YOU let a WOMAN do as she likes
Yes Ill see that she likes to love me
If she doesntwell I dont hold her
If you were as wonderful as you say replied Clara
I should be the marvel I am he laughed
There was a silence in which they hated each other though they laughed
Loves a dog in a manger he said
And which of us is the dog
she asked
Oh well you of course
So there went on a battle between them
She knew she never fully had him
Some part big and vital in him she had no hold over nor did she ever try to get it or even to realise what it was
And he knew in some way that she held herself still as Mrs Dawes
She did not love Dawes never had loved him but she believed he loved her at least depended on her
She felt a certain surety about him that she never felt with Paul Morel
Her passion for the young man had filled her soul given her a certain satisfaction eased her of her selfmistrust her doubt
Whatever else she was she was inwardly assured
It was almost as if she had gained HERSELF and stood now distinct and complete
She had received her confirmation but she never believed that her life belonged to Paul Morel nor his to her
They would separate in the end and the rest of her life would be an ache after him
But at any rate she knew now she was sure of herself
And the same could almost be said of him
Together they had received the baptism of life each through the other but now their missions were separate
Where he wanted to go she could not come with him
They would have to part sooner or later
Even if they married and were faithful to each other still he would have to leave her go on alone and she would only have to attend to him when he came home
But it was not possible
Each wanted a mate to go side by side with
Clara had gone to live with her mother upon Mapperley Plains
One evening as Paul and she were walking along Woodborough Road they met Dawes
Morel knew something about the bearing of the man approaching but he was absorbed in his thinking at the moment so that only his artists eye watched the form of the stranger
Then he suddenly turned to Clara with a laugh and put his hand on her shoulder saying laughing But we walk side by side and yet Im in London arguing with an imaginary Orpen and where are you
At that instant Dawes passed almost touching Morel
The young man glanced saw the dark brown eyes burning full of hate and yet tired
Who was that
he asked of Clara
It was Baxter she replied
Paul took his hand from her shoulder and glanced round then he saw again distinctly the mans form as it approached him
Dawes still walked erect with his fine shoulders flung back and his face lifted but there was a furtive look in his eyes that gave one the impression he was trying to get unnoticed past every person he met glancing suspiciously to see what they thought of him
And his hands seemed to be wanting to hide
He wore old clothes the trousers were torn at the knee and the handkerchief tied round his throat was dirty but his cap was still defiantly over one eye
As she saw him Clara felt guilty
There was a tiredness and despair on his face that made her hate him because it hurt her
He looks shady said Paul
But the note of pity in his voice reproached her and made her feel hard
His true commonness comes out she answered
Do you hate him
he asked
You talk she said about the cruelty of women I wish you knew the cruelty of men in their brute force
They simply dont know that the woman exists
Dont I
he said
No she answered
Dont I know you exist
About ME you know nothing she said bitterlyabout ME
No more than Baxter knew
he asked
Perhaps not as much
He felt puzzled and helpless and angry
There she walked unknown to him though they had been through such experience together
But you know ME pretty well he said
She did not answer
Did you know Baxter as well as you know me
he asked
He wouldnt let me she said
And I have let you know me
Its what men WONT let you do
They wont let you get really near to them she said
And havent I let you
Yes she answered slowly but youve never come near to me
You cant come out of yourself you cant
Baxter could do that better than you
He walked on pondering
He was angry with her for prefering Baxter to him
You begin to value Baxter now youve not got him he said
No I can only see where he was different from you
But he felt she had a grudge against him
One evening as they were coming home over the fields she startled him by asking Do you think its worth itthethe sex part
The act of loving itself
Yes is it worth anything to you
But how can you separate it
he said
Its the culmination of everything
All our intimacy culminates then
Not for me she said
He was silent
A flash of hate for her came up
After all she was dissatisfied with him even there where he thought they fulfilled each other
But he believed her too implicitly
I feel she continued slowly as if I hadnt got you as if all of you werent there and as if it werent ME you were taking Who then
Something just for yourself
It has been fine so that I darent think of it
But is it ME you want or is it IT
He again felt guilty
Did he leave Clara out of count and take simply women
But he thought that was splitting a hair
When I had Baxter actually had him then I DID feel as if I had all of him she said
And it was better
he asked
Yes yes it was more whole
I dont say you havent given me more than he ever gave me
Or could give you
Yes perhaps but youve never given me yourself
He knitted his brows angrily
If I start to make love to you he said I just go like a leaf down the wind
And leave me out of count she said
And then is it nothing to you
he asked almost rigid with chagrin
Its something and sometimes you have carried me awayright awayI knowandI reverence you for itbut Dont but me he said kissing her quickly as a fire ran through him
She submitted and was silent
It was true as he said
As a rule when he started lovemaking the emotion was strong enough to carry with it everythingreason soul bloodin a great sweep like the Trent carries bodily its backswirls and intertwinings noiselessly
Gradually the little criticisms the little sensations were lost thought also went everything borne along in one flood
He became not a man with a mind but a great instinct
His hands were like creatures living his limbs his body were all life and consciousness subject to no will of his but living in themselves
Just as he was so it seemed the vigorous wintry stars were strong also with life
He and they struck with the same pulse of fire and the same joy of strength which held the brackenfrond stiff near his eyes held his own body firm
It was as if he and the stars and the dark herbage and Clara were licked up in an immense tongue of flame which tore onwards and upwards
Everything rushed along in living beside him everything was still perfect in itself along with him
This wonderful stillness in each thing in itself while it was being borne along in a very ecstasy of living seemed the highest point of bliss
And Clara knew this held him to her so she trusted altogether to the passion
It however failed her very often
They did not often reach again the height of that once when the peewits had called
Gradually some mechanical effort spoilt their loving or when they had splendid moments they had them separately and not so satisfactorily
So often he seemed merely to be running on alone often they realised it had been a failure not what they had wanted
He left her knowing THAT evening had only made a little split between them
Their loving grew more mechanical without the marvellous glamour
Gradually they began to introduce novelties to get back some of the feeling of satisfaction
They would be very near almost dangerously near to the river so that the black water ran not far from his face and it gave a little thrill or they loved sometimes in a little hollow below the fence of the path where people were passing occasionally on the edge of the town and they heard footsteps coming almost felt the vibration of the tread and they heard what the passersby saidstrange little things that were never intended to be heard
And afterwards each of them was rather ashamed and these things caused a distance between the two of them
He began to despise her a little as if she had merited it
One night he left her to go to Daybrook Station over the fields
It was very dark with an attempt at snow although the spring was so far advanced
Morel had not much time he plunged forward
The town ceases almost abruptly on the edge of a steep hollow there the houses with their yellow lights stand up against the darkness
He went over the stile and dropped quickly into the hollow of the fields
Under the orchard one warm window shone in Swineshead Farm
Paul glanced round
Behind the houses stood on the brim of the dip black against the sky like wild beasts glaring curiously with yellow eyes down into the darkness
It was the town that seemed savage and uncouth glaring on the clouds at the back of him
Some creature stirred under the willows of the farm pond
It was too dark to distinguish anything
He was close up to the next stile before he saw a dark shape leaning against it
The man moved aside
Goodevening
he said
Goodevening
Morel answered not noticing
Paul Morel
said the man
Then he knew it was Dawes
The man stopped his way
Ive got yer have I
he said awkwardly
I shall miss my train said Paul
He could see nothing of Dawess face
The mans teeth seemed to chatter as he talked
Youre going to get it from me now said Dawes
Morel attempted to move forward the other man stepped in front of him
Are yer goin to take that topcoat off he said or are you goin to lie down to it
Paul was afraid the man was mad
But he said I dont know how to fight
All right then answered Dawes and before the younger man knew where he was he was staggering backwards from a blow across the face
The whole night went black
He tore off his overcoat and coat dodging a blow and flung the garments over Dawes
The latter swore savagely
Morel in his shirtsleeves was now alert and furious
He felt his whole body unsheath itself like a claw
He could not fight so he would use his wits
The other man became more distinct to him he could see particularly the shirtbreast
Dawes stumbled over Pauls coats then came rushing forward
The young mans mouth was bleeding
It was the other mans mouth he was dying to get at and the desire was anguish in its strength
He stepped quickly through the stile and as Dawes was coming through after him like a flash he got a blow in over the others mouth
He shivered with pleasure
Dawes advanced slowly spitting
Paul was afraid he moved round to get to the stile again
Suddenly from out of nowhere came a great blow against his ear that sent him falling helpless backwards
He heard Dawess heavy panting like a wild beasts then came a kick on the knee giving him such agony that he got up and quite blind leapt clean under his enemys guard
He felt blows and kicks but they did not hurt
He hung on to the bigger man like a wild cat till at last Dawes fell with a crash losing his presence of mind
Paul went down with him
Pure instinct brought his hands to the mans neck and before Dawes in frenzy and agony could wrench him free he had got his fists twisted in the scarf and his knuckles dug in the throat of the other man
He was a pure instinct without reason or feeling
His body hard and wonderful in itself cleaved against the struggling body of the other man not a muscle in him relaxed
He was quite unconscious only his body had taken upon itself to kill this other man
For himself he had neither feeling nor reason
He lay pressed hard against his adversary his body adjusting itself to its one pure purpose of choking the other man resisting exactly at the right moment with exactly the right amount of strength the struggles of the other silent intent unchanging gradually pressing its knuckles deeper feeling the struggles of the other body become wilder and more frenzied
Tighter and tighter grew his body like a screw that is gradually increasing in pressure till something breaks
Then suddenly he relaxed full of wonder and misgiving
Dawes had been yielding
Morel felt his body flame with pain as he realised what he was doing he was all bewildered
Dawess struggles suddenly renewed themselves in a furious spasm
Pauls hands were wrenched torn out of the scarf in which they were knotted and he was flung away helpless
He heard the horrid sound of the others gasping but he lay stunned then still dazed he felt the blows of the others feet and lost consciousness
Dawes grunting with pain like a beast was kicking the prostrate body of his rival
Suddenly the whistle of the train shrieked two fields away
He turned round and glared suspiciously
What was coming
He saw the lights of the train draw across his vision
It seemed to him people were approaching
He made off across the field into Nottingham and dimly in his consciousness as he went he felt on his foot the place where his boot had knocked against one of the lads bones
The knock seemed to reecho inside him he hurried to get away from it
Morel gradually came to himself
He knew where he was and what had happened but he did not want to move
He lay still with tiny bits of snow tickling his face
It was pleasant to lie quite quite still
The time passed
It was the bits of snow that kept rousing him when he did not want to be roused
At last his will clicked into action
I mustnt lie here he said its silly
But still he did not move
I said I was going to get up he repeated
Why dont I
And still it was some time before he had sufficiently pulled himself together to stir then gradually he got up
Pain made him sick and dazed but his brain was clear
Reeling he groped for his coats and got them on buttoning his overcoat up to his ears
It was some time before he found his cap
He did not know whether his face was still bleeding
Walking blindly every step making him sick with pain he went back to the pond and washed his face and hands
The icy water hurt but helped to bring him back to himself
He crawled back up the hill to the tram
He wanted to get to his motherhe must get to his motherthat was his blind intention
He covered his face as much as he could and struggled sickly along
Continually the ground seemed to fall away from him as he walked and he felt himself dropping with a sickening feeling into space so like a nightmare he got through with the journey home
Everybody was in bed
He looked at himself
His face was discoloured and smeared with blood almost like a dead mans face
He washed it and went to bed
The night went by in delirium
In the morning he found his mother looking at him
Her blue eyesthey were all he wanted to see
She was there he was in her hands
Its not much mother he said
It was Baxter Dawes
Tell me where it hurts you she said quietly
I dont knowmy shoulder
Say it was a bicycle accident mother
He could not move his arm
Presently Minnie the little servant came upstairs with some tea
Your mothers nearly frightened me out of my witsfainted away she said
He felt he could not bear it
His mother nursed him he told her about it
And now I should have done with them all she said quietly
I will mother
She covered him up
And dont think about it she saidonly try to go to sleep
The doctor wont be here till eleven
He had a dislocated shoulder and the second day acute bronchitis set in
His mother was pale as death now and very thin
She would sit and look at him then away into space
There was something between them that neither dared mention
Clara came to see him
Afterwards he said to his mother She makes me tired mother
Yes I wish she wouldnt come Mrs Morel replied
Another day Miriam came but she seemed almost like a stranger to him
You know I dont care about them mother he said
Im afraid you dont my son she replied sadly
It was given out everywhere that it was a bicycle accident
Soon he was able to go to work again but now there was a constant sickness and gnawing at his heart
He went to Clara but there seemed as it were nobody there
He could not work
He and his mother seemed almost to avoid each other
There was some secret between them which they could not bear
He was not aware of it
He only knew that his life seemed unbalanced as if it were going to smash into pieces
Clara did not know what was the matter with him
She realised that he seemed unaware of her
Even when he came to her he seemed unaware of her always he was somewhere else
She felt she was clutching for him and he was somewhere else
It tortured her and so she tortured him
For a month at a time she kept him at arms length
He almost hated her and was driven to her in spite of himself
He went mostly into the company of men was always at the George or the White Horse
His mother was ill distant quiet shadowy
He was terrified of something he dared not look at her
Her eyes seemed to grow darker her face more waxen still she dragged about at her work
At Whitsuntide he said he would go to Blackpool for four days with his friend Newton
The latter was a big jolly fellow with a touch of the bounder about him
Paul said his mother must go to Sheffield to stay a week with Annie who lived there
Perhaps the change would do her good
Mrs Morel was attending a womans doctor in Nottingham
He said her heart and her digestion were wrong
She consented to go to Sheffield though she did not want to but now she would do everything her son wished of her
Paul said he would come for her on the fifth day and stay also in Sheffield till the holiday was up
It was agreed
The two young men set off gaily for Blackpool
Mrs Morel was quite lively as Paul kissed her and left her
Once at the station he forgot everything
Four days were clearnot an anxiety not a thought
The two young men simply enjoyed themselves
Paul was like another man
None of himself remainedno Clara no Miriam no mother that fretted him
He wrote to them all and long letters to his mother but they were jolly letters that made her laugh
He was having a good time as young fellows will in a place like Blackpool
And underneath it all was a shadow for her
Paul was very gay excited at the thought of staying with his mother in Sheffield
Newton was to spend the day with them
Their train was late
Joking laughing with their pipes between their teeth the young men swung their bags on to the tramcar
Paul had bought his mother a little collar of real lace that he wanted to see her wear so that he could tease her about it
Annie lived in a nice house and had a little maid
Paul ran gaily up the steps
He expected his mother laughing in the hall but it was Annie who opened to him
She seemed distant to him
He stood a second in dismay
Annie let him kiss her cheek
Is my mother ill
he said
Yes shes not very well
Dont upset her
Is she in bed
Yes
And then the queer feeling went over him as if all the sunshine had gone out of him and it was all shadow
He dropped the bag and ran upstairs
Hesitating he opened the door
His mother sat up in bed wearing a dressinggown of oldrose colour
She looked at him almost as if she were ashamed of herself pleading to him humble
He saw the ashy look about her
Mother
he said
I thought you were never coming she answered gaily
But he only fell on his knees at the bedside and buried his face in the bedclothes crying in agony and saying Mothermothermother
She stroked his hair slowly with her thin hand
Dont cry she said
Dont cryits nothing
But he felt as if his blood was melting into tears and he cried in terror and pain
Dontdont cry his mother faltered
Slowly she stroked his hair
Shocked out of himself he cried and the tears hurt in every fibre of his body
Suddenly he stopped but he dared not lift his face out of the bedclothes
You ARE late
Where have you been
his mother asked
The train was late he replied muffled in the sheet
Yes that miserable Central
Is Newton come
Yes
Im sure you must be hungry and theyve kept dinner waiting
With a wrench he looked up at her
What is it mother
he asked brutally
She averted her eyes as she answered Only a bit of a tumour my boy
You neednt trouble
Its been therethe lump hasa long time
Up came the tears again
His mind was clear and hard but his body was crying
Where
he said
She put her hand on her side
Here
But you know they can sweal a tumour away
He stood feeling dazed and helpless like a child
He thought perhaps it was as she said
Yes he reassured himself it was so
But all the while his blood and his body knew definitely what it was
He sat down on the bed and took her hand
She had never had but the one ringher weddingring
When were you poorly
he asked
It was yesterday it began she answered submissively
Pains
Yes but not more than Ive often had at home
I believe Dr Ansell is an alarmist
You ought not to have travelled alone he said to himself more than to her
As if that had anything to do with it
she answered quickly
They were silent for a while
Now go and have your dinner she said
You MUST be hungry
Have you had yours
Yes a beautiful sole I had
Annie IS good to me
They talked a little while then he went downstairs
He was very white and strained
Newton sat in miserable sympathy
After dinner he went into the scullery to help Annie to wash up
The little maid had gone on an errand
Is it really a tumour
he asked
Annie began to cry again
The pain she had yesterdayI never saw anybody suffer like it
she cried
Leonard ran like a madman for Dr Ansell and when shed got to bed she said to me Annie look at this lump on my side
I wonder what it is
And there I looked and I thought I should have dropped
Paul as true as Im here its a lump as big as my double fist
I said Good gracious mother whenever did that come
Why child she said its been there a long time
I thought I should have died our Paul I did
Shes been having these pains for months at home and nobody looking after her
The tears came to his eyes then dried suddenly
But shes been attending the doctor in Nottinghamand she never told me he said
If Id have been at home said Annie I should have seen for myself
He felt like a man walking in unrealities
In the afternoon he went to see the doctor
The latter was a shrewd lovable man
But what is it
he said
The doctor looked at the young man then knitted his fingers
It may be a large tumour which has formed in the membrane he said slowly and which we MAY be able to make go away
Cant you operate
asked Paul
Not there replied the doctor
Are you sure
QUITE
Paul meditated a while
Are you sure its a tumour
he asked
Why did Dr Jameson in Nottingham never find out anything about it
Shes been going to him for weeks and hes treated her for heart and indigestion
Mrs Morel never told Dr Jameson about the lump said the doctor
And do you KNOW its a tumour
No I am not sure
What else MIGHT it be
You asked my sister if there was cancer in the family
Might it be cancer
I dont know
And what shall you do
I should like an examination with Dr
Jameson
Then have one
You must arrange about that
His fee wouldnt be less than ten guineas to come here from Nottingham
When would you like him to come
I will call in this evening and we will talk it over
Paul went away biting his lip
His mother could come downstairs for tea the doctor said
Her son went upstairs to help her
She wore the oldrose dressinggown that Leonard had given Annie and with a little colour in her face was quite young again
But you look quite pretty in that he said
Yes they make me so fine I hardly know myself she answered
But when she stood up to walk the colour went
Paul helped her halfcarrying her
At the top of the stairs she was gone
He lifted her up and carried her quickly downstairs laid her on the couch
She was light and frail
Her face looked as if she were dead with blue lips shut tight
Her eyes openedher blue unfailing eyes and she looked at him pleadingly almost wanting him to forgive her
He held brandy to her lips but her mouth would not open
All the time she watched him lovingly
She was only sorry for him
The tears ran down his face without ceasing but not a muscle moved
He was intent on getting a little brandy between her lips
Soon she was able to swallow a teaspoonful
She lay back so tired
The tears continued to run down his face
But she panted itll go off
Dont cry
Im not doing he said
After a while she was better again
He was kneeling beside the couch
They looked into each others eyes
I dont want you to make a trouble of it she said
No mother
Youll have to be quite still and then youll get better soon
But he was white to the lips and their eyes as they looked at each other understood
Her eyes were so bluesuch a wonderful forgetmenot blue
He felt if only they had been of a different colour he could have borne it better
His heart seemed to be ripping slowly in his breast
He kneeled there holding her hand and neither said anything
Then Annie came in
Are you all right
she murmured timidly to her mother
Of course said Mrs Morel
Paul sat down and told her about Blackpool
She was curious
A day or two after he went to see Dr Jameson in Nottingham to arrange for a consultation
Paul had practically no money in the world
But he could borrow
His mother had been used to go to the public consultation on Saturday morning when she could see the doctor for only a nominal sum
Her son went on the same day
The waitingroom was full of poor women who sat patiently on a bench around the wall
Paul thought of his mother in her little black costume sitting waiting likewise
The doctor was late
The women all looked rather frightened
Paul asked the nurse in attendance if he could see the doctor immediately he came
It was arranged so
The women sitting patiently round the walls of the room eyed the young man curiously
At last the doctor came
He was about forty goodlooking brownskinned
His wife had died and he who had loved her had specialised on womens ailments
Paul told his name and his mothers
The doctor did not remember
Number fortysix M said the nurse and the doctor looked up the case in his book
There is a big lump that may be a tumour said Paul
But Dr Ansell was going to write you a letter
Ah yes
replied the doctor drawing the letter from his pocket
He was very friendly affable busy kind
He would come to Sheffield the next day
What is your father
he asked
He is a coalminer replied Paul
Not very well off I suppose
ThisI see after this said Paul
And you
smiled the doctor
I am a clerk in Jordans Appliance Factory
The doctor smiled at him
Erto go to Sheffield
he said putting the tips of his fingers together and smiling with his eyes
Eight guineas
Thank you
said Paul flushing and rising
And youll come tomorrow
TomorrowSunday
Yes
Can you tell me about what time there is a train in the afternoon
There is a Central gets in at fourfifteen
And will there be any way of getting up to the house
Shall I have to walk
The doctor smiled
There is the tram said Paul the Western Park tram
The doctor made a note of it
Thank you
he said and shook hands
Then Paul went on home to see his father who was left in the charge of Minnie
Walter Morel was getting very grey now
Paul found him digging in the garden
He had written him a letter
He shook hands with his father
Hello son
Tha has landed then
said the father
Yes replied the son
But Im going back tonight
Are ter beguy
exclaimed the collier
An has ter eaten owt
No
Thats just like thee said Morel
Come thy ways in
The father was afraid of the mention of his wife
The two went indoors
Paul ate in silence his father with earthy hands and sleeves rolled up sat in the armchair opposite and looked at him
Well an how is she
asked the miner at length in a little voice
She can sit up she can be carried down for tea said Paul
Thats a blessin
exclaimed Morel
I hope we sll soon be havin her whoam then
An whats that Nottingham doctor say
Hes going tomorrow to have an examination of her
Is he beguy
Thats a tidy penny Im thinkin
Eight guineas
Eight guineas
the miner spoke breathlessly
Well we mun find it from somewhere
I can pay that said Paul
There was silence between them for some time
She says she hopes youre getting on all right with Minnie Paul said
Yes Im all right an I wish as she was answered Morel
But Minnies a good little wench bless er heart
He sat looking dismal
I sll have to be going at halfpast three said Paul
Its a trapse for thee lad
Eight guineas
An when dost think shell be able to get as far as this
We must see what the doctors say tomorrow Paul said
Morel sighed deeply
The house seemed strangely empty and Paul thought his father looked lost forlorn and old
Youll have to go and see her next week father he said
I hope shell be awhoam by that time said Morel
If shes not said Paul then you must come
I dunno wheer I sll find th money said Morel
And Ill write to you what the doctor says said Paul
But tha writes i such a fashion I canna mae it out said Morel
Well Ill write plain
It was no good asking Morel to answer for he could scarcely do more than write his own name
The doctor came
Leonard felt it his duty to meet him with a cab
The examination did not take long
Annie Arthur Paul and Leonard were waiting in the parlour anxiously
The doctors came down
Paul glanced at them
He had never had any hope except when he had deceived himself
It MAY be a tumour we must wait and see said Dr Jameson
And if it is said Annie can you sweal it away
Probably said the doctor
Paul put eight sovereigns and half a sovereign on the table
The doctor counted them took a florin out of his purse and put that down
Thank you
he said
Im sorry Mrs Morel is so ill
But we must see what we can do
There cant be an operation
said Paul
The doctor shook his head
No he said and even if there could her heart wouldnt stand it
Is her heart risky
asked Paul
Yes you must be careful with her
Very risky
Noerno no
Just take care
And the doctor was gone
Then Paul carried his mother downstairs
She lay simply like a child
But when he was on the stairs she put her arms round his neck clinging
Im so frightened of these beastly stairs she said
And he was frightened too
He would let Leonard do it another time
He felt he could not carry her
He thinks its only a tumour
cried Annie to her mother
And he can sweal it away
I KNEW he could protested Mrs Morel scornfully
She pretended not to notice that Paul had gone out of the room
He sat in the kitchen smoking
Then he tried to brush some grey ash off his coat
He looked again
It was one of his mothers grey hairs
It was so long
He held it up and it drifted into the chimney
He let go
The long grey hair floated and was gone in the blackness of the chimney
The next day he kissed her before going back to work
It was very early in the morning and they were alone
You wont fret my boy
she said
No mother
No it would be silly
And take care of yourself
Yes he answered
Then after a while And I shall come next Saturday and shall bring my father
I suppose he wants to come she replied
At any rate if he does youll have to let him
He kissed her again and stroked the hair from her temples gently tenderly as if she were a lover
Shant you be late
she murmured
Im going he said very low
Still he sat a few minutes stroking the brown and grey hair from her temples
And you wont be any worse mother
No my son
You promise me
Yes I wont be any worse
He kissed her held her in his arms for a moment and was gone
In the early sunny morning he ran to the station crying all the way he did not know what for
And her blue eyes were wide and staring as she thought of him
In the afternoon he went a walk with Clara
They sat in the little wood where bluebells were standing
He took her hand
Youll see he said to Clara shell never be better
Oh you dont know
replied the other
I do he said
She caught him impulsively to her breast
Try and forget it dear she said try and forget it
I will he answered
Her breast was there warm for him her hands were in his hair
It was comforting and he held his arms round her
But he did not forget
He only talked to Clara of something else
And it was always so
When she felt it coming the agony she cried to him Dont think of it Paul
Dont think of it my darling
And she pressed him to her breast rocked him soothed him like a child
So he put the trouble aside for her sake to take it up again immediately he was alone
All the time as he went about he cried mechanically
His mind and hands were busy
He cried he did not know why
It was his blood weeping
He was just as much alone whether he was with Clara or with the men in the White Horse
Just himself and this pressure inside him that was all that existed
He read sometimes
He had to keep his mind occupied
And Clara was a way of occupying his mind
On the Saturday Walter Morel went to Sheffield
He was a forlorn figure looking rather as if nobody owned him
Paul ran upstairs
My fathers come he said kissing his mother
Has he
she answered wearily
The old collier came rather frightened into the bedroom
How dun I find thee lass
he said going forward and kissing her in a hasty timid fashion
Well Im middlin she replied
I see tha art he said
He stood looking down on her
Then he wiped his eyes with his handkerchief
Helpless and as if nobody owned him he looked
Have you gone on all right
asked the wife rather wearily as if it were an effort to talk to him
Yis he answered
Ers a bit behinthand now and again as yer might expect
Does she have your dinner ready
asked Mrs Morel
Well Ive ad to shout at er once or twice he said
And you MUST shout at her if shes not ready
She WILL leave things to the last minute
She gave him a few instructions
He sat looking at her as if she were almost a stranger to him before whom he was awkward and humble and also as if he had lost his presence of mind and wanted to run
This feeling that he wanted to run away that he was on thorns to be gone from so trying a situation and yet must linger because it looked better made his presence so trying
He put up his eyebrows for misery and clenched his fists on his knees feeling so awkward in presence of big trouble
Mrs Morel did not change much
She stayed in Sheffield for two months
If anything at the end she was rather worse
But she wanted to go home
Annie had her children
Mrs Morel wanted to go home
So they got a motorcar from Nottinghamfor she was too ill to go by trainand she was driven through the sunshine
It was just August everything was bright and warm
Under the blue sky they could all see she was dying
Yet she was jollier than she had been for weeks
They all laughed and talked
Annie she exclaimed I saw a lizard dart on that rock
Her eyes were so quick she was still so full of life
Morel knew she was coming
He had the front door open
Everybody was on tiptoe
Half the street turned out
They heard the sound of the great motorcar
Mrs Morel smiling drove home down the street
And just look at them all come out to see me
she said
But there I suppose I should have done the same
How do you do Mrs Mathews
How are you Mrs
Harrison
They none of them could hear but they saw her smile and nod
And they all saw death on her face they said
It was a great event in the street
Morel wanted to carry her indoors but he was too old
Arthur took her as if she were a child
They had set her a big deep chair by the hearth where her rockingchair used to stand
When she was unwrapped and seated and had drunk a little brandy she looked round the room
Dont think I dont like your house Annie she said but its nice to be in my own home again
And Morel answered huskily It is lass it is
And Minnie the little quaint maid said An we glad t ave yer
There was a lovely yellow ravel of sunflowers in the garden
She looked out of the window
There are my sunflowers
she said
CHAPTER XIV THE RELEASE By the way said Dr Ansell one evening when Morel was in Sheffield weve got a man in the fever hospital here who comes from NottinghamDawes
He doesnt seem to have many belongings in this world
Baxter Dawes
Paul exclaimed
Thats the manhas been a fine fellow physically I should think
Been in a bit of a mess lately
You know him
He used to work at the place where I am
Did he
Do you know anything about him
Hes just sulking or hed be a lot better than he is by now
I dont know anything of his home circumstances except that hes separated from his wife and has been a bit down I believe
But tell him about me will you
Tell him Ill come and see him
The next time Morel saw the doctor he said And what about Dawes
I said to him answered the other Do you know a man from Nottingham named Morel
and he looked at me as if hed jump at my throat
So I said I see you know the name its Paul Morel
Then I told him about your saying you would go and see him
What does he want
he said as if you were a policeman
And did he say he would see me
asked Paul
He wouldnt say anythinggood bad or indifferent replied the doctor
Why not
Thats what I want to know
There he lies and sulks day in day out
Cant get a word of information out of him
Do you think I might go
asked Paul
You might
There was a feeling of connection between the rival men more than ever since they had fought
In a way Morel felt guilty towards the other and more or less responsible
And being in such a state of soul himself he felt an almost painful nearness to Dawes who was suffering and despairing too
Besides they had met in a naked extremity of hate and it was a bond
At any rate the elemental man in each had met
He went down to the isolation hospital with Dr Ansells card
This sister a healthy young Irishwoman led him down the ward
A visitor to see you Jim Crow she said
Dawes turned over suddenly with a startled grunt
Eh
Caw
she mocked
He can only say Caw
I have brought you a gentleman to see you
Now say Thank you and show some manners
Dawes looked swiftly with his dark startled eyes beyond the sister at Paul
His look was full of fear mistrust hate and misery
Morel met the swift dark eyes and hesitated
The two men were afraid of the naked selves they had been
Dr Ansell told me you were here said Morel holding out his hand
Dawes mechanically shook hands
So I thought Id come in continued Paul
There was no answer
Dawes lay staring at the opposite wall
Say Caw
mocked the nurse
Say Caw
Jim Crow
He is getting on all right
said Paul to her
Oh yes
He lies and imagines hes going to die said the nurse and it frightens every word out of his mouth
And you MUST have somebody to talk to laughed Morel
Thats it
laughed the nurse
Only two old men and a boy who always cries
It is hard lines
Here am I dying to hear Jim Crows voice and nothing but an odd Caw
will he give
So rough on you
said Morel
Isnt it
said the nurse
I suppose I am a godsend he laughed
Oh dropped straight from heaven
laughed the nurse
Presently she left the two men alone
Dawes was thinner and handsome again but life seemed low in him
As the doctor said he was lying sulking and would not move forward towards convalescence
He seemed to grudge every beat of his heart
Have you had a bad time
asked Paul
Suddenly again Dawes looked at him
What are you doing in Sheffield
he asked
My mother was taken ill at my sisters in Thurston Street
What are you doing here
There was no answer
How long have you been in
Morel asked
I couldnt say for sure Dawes answered grudgingly
He lay staring across at the wall opposite as if trying to believe Morel was not there
Paul felt his heart go hard and angry
Dr Ansell told me you were here he said coldly
The other man did not answer
Typhoids pretty bad I know Morel persisted
Suddenly Dawes said What did you come for
Because Dr Ansell said you didnt know anybody here
Do you
I know nobody nowhere said Dawes
Well said Paul its because you dont choose to then
There was another silence
We sll be taking my mother home as soon as we can said Paul
Whats amatter with her
asked Dawes with a sick mans interest in illness
Shes got a cancer
There was another silence
But we want to get her home said Paul
We sll have to get a motorcar
Dawes lay thinking
Why dont you ask Thomas Jordan to lend you his
said Dawes
Its not big enough Morel answered
Dawes blinked his dark eyes as he lay thinking
Then ask Jack Pilkington hed lend it you
You know him
I think I sll hire one said Paul
Youre a fool if you do said Dawes
The sick man was gaunt and handsome again
Paul was sorry for him because his eyes looked so tired
Did you get a job here
he asked
I was only here a day or two before I was taken bad Dawes replied
You want to get in a convalescent home said Paul
The others face clouded again
Im goin in no convalescent home he said
My fathers been in the one at Seathorpe an he liked it
Dr Ansell would get you a recommend
Dawes lay thinking
It was evident he dared not face the world again
The seaside would be all right just now Morel said
Sun on those sandhills and the waves not far out
The other did not answer
By Gad
Paul concluded too miserable to bother much its all right when you know youre going to walk again and swim
Dawes glanced at him quickly
The mans dark eyes were afraid to meet any other eyes in the world
But the real misery and helplessness in Pauls tone gave him a feeling of relief
Is she far gone
he asked
Shes going like wax Paul answered but cheerfullively
He bit his lip
After a minute he rose
Well Ill be going he said
Ill leave you this halfcrown
I dont want it Dawes muttered
Morel did not answer but left the coin on the table
Well he said Ill try and run in when Im back in Sheffield
Happen you might like to see my brotherinlaw
He works in Pyecrofts
I dont know him said Dawes
Hes all right
Should I tell him to come
He might bring you some papers to look at
The other man did not answer
Paul went
The strong emotion that Dawes aroused in him repressed made him shiver
He did not tell his mother but next day he spoke to Clara about this interview
It was in the dinnerhour
The two did not often go out together now but this day he asked her to go with him to the Castle grounds
There they sat while the scarlet geraniums and the yellow calceolarias blazed in the sunlight
She was now always rather protective and rather resentful towards him
Did you know Baxter was in Sheffield Hospital with typhoid
he asked
She looked at him with startled grey eyes and her face went pale
No she said frightened
Hes getting better
I went to see him yesterdaythe doctor told me
Clara seemed stricken by the news
Is he very bad
she asked guiltily
He has been
Hes mending now
What did he say to you
Oh nothing
He seems to be sulking
There was a distance between the two of them
He gave her more information
She went about shut up and silent
The next time they took a walk together she disengaged herself from his arm and walked at a distance from him
He was wanting her comfort badly
Wont you be nice with me
he asked
She did not answer
Whats the matter
he said putting his arm across her shoulder
Dont
she said disengaging herself
He left her alone and returned to his own brooding
Is it Baxter that upsets you
he asked at length
I HAVE been VILE to him
she said
Ive said many a time you havent treated him well he replied
And there was a hostility between them
Each pursued his own train of thought
Ive treated himno Ive treated him badly she said
And now you treat ME badly
It serves me right
How do I treat you badly
he said
It serves me right she repeated
I never considered him worth having and now you dont consider ME
But it serves me right
He loved me a thousand times better than you ever did
He didnt
protested Paul
He did
At any rate he did respect me and thats what you dont do
It looked as if he respected you
he said
He did
And I MADE him horridI know I did
Youve taught me that
And he loved me a thousand times better than ever you do
All right said Paul
He only wanted to be left alone now
He had his own trouble which was almost too much to bear
Clara only tormented him and made him tired
He was not sorry when he left her
She went on the first opportunity to Sheffield to see her husband
The meeting was not a success
But she left him roses and fruit and money
She wanted to make restitution
It was not that she loved him
As she looked at him lying there her heart did not warm with love
Only she wanted to humble herself to him to kneel before him
She wanted now to be selfsacrificial
After all she had failed to make Morel really love her
She was morally frightened
She wanted to do penance
So she kneeled to Dawes and it gave him a subtle pleasure
But the distance between them was still very greattoo great
It frightened the man
It almost pleased the woman
She liked to feel she was serving him across an insuperable distance
She was proud now
Morel went to see Dawes once or twice
There was a sort of friendship between the two men who were all the while deadly rivals
But they never mentioned the woman who was between them
Mrs Morel got gradually worse
At first they used to carry her downstairs sometimes even into the garden
She sat propped in her chair smiling and so pretty
The gold weddingring shone on her white hand her hair was carefully brushed
And she watched the tangled sunflowers dying the chrysanthemums coming out and the dahlias
Paul and she were afraid of each other
He knew and she knew that she was dying
But they kept up a pretence of cheerfulness
Every morning when he got up he went into her room in his pyjamas
Did you sleep my dear
he asked
Yes she answered
Not very well
Well yes 
Then he knew she had lain awake
He saw her hand under the bedclothes pressing the place on her side where the pain was
Has it been bad
he asked
No
It hurt a bit but nothing to mention
And she sniffed in her old scornful way
As she lay she looked like a girl
And all the while her blue eyes watched him
But there were the dark paincircles beneath that made him ache again
Its a sunny day he said
Its a beautiful day
Do you think youll be carried down
I shall see
Then he went away to get her breakfast
All day long he was conscious of nothing but her
It was a long ache that made him feverish
Then when he got home in the early evening he glanced through the kitchen window
She was not there she had not got up
He ran straight upstairs and kissed her
He was almost afraid to ask Didnt you get up pigeon
No she said
it was that morphia it made me tired
I think he gives you too much he said
I think he does she answered
He sat down by the bed miserably
She had a way of curling and lying on her side like a child
The grey and brown hair was loose over her ear
Doesnt it tickle you
he said gently putting it back
It does she replied
His face was near hers
Her blue eyes smiled straight into his like a girlswarm laughing with tender love
It made him pant with terror agony and love
You want your hair doing in a plait he said
Lie still
And going behind her he carefully loosened her hair brushed it out
It was like fine long silk of brown and grey
Her head was snuggled between her shoulders
As he lightly brushed and plaited her hair he bit his lip and felt dazed
It all seemed unreal he could not understand it
At night he often worked in her room looking up from time to time
And so often he found her blue eyes fixed on him
And when their eyes met she smiled
He worked away again mechanically producing good stuff without knowing what he was doing
Sometimes he came in very pale and still with watchful sudden eyes like a man who is drunk almost to death
They were both afraid of the veils that were ripping between them
Then she pretended to be better chattered to him gaily made a great fuss over some scraps of news
For they had both come to the condition when they had to make much of the trifles lest they should give in to the big thing and their human independence would go smash
They were afraid so they made light of things and were gay
Sometimes as she lay he knew she was thinking of the past
Her mouth gradually shut hard in a line
She was holding herself rigid so that she might die without ever uttering the great cry that was tearing from her
He never forgot that hard utterly lonely and stubborn clenching of her mouth which persisted for weeks
Sometimes when it was lighter she talked about her husband
Now she hated him
She did not forgive him
She could not bear him to be in the room
And a few things the things that had been most bitter to her came up again so strongly that they broke from her and she told her son
He felt as if his life were being destroyed piece by piece within him
Often the tears came suddenly
He ran to the station the teardrops falling on the pavement
Often he could not go on with his work
The pen stopped writing
He sat staring quite unconscious
And when he came round again he felt sick and trembled in his limbs
He never questioned what it was
His mind did not try to analyse or understand
He merely submitted and kept his eyes shut let the thing go over him
His mother did the same
She thought of the pain of the morphia of the next day hardly ever of the death
That was coming she knew
She had to submit to it
But she would never entreat it or make friends with it
Blind with her face shut hard and blind she was pushed towards the door
The days passed the weeks the months
Sometimes in the sunny afternoons she seemed almost happy
I try to think of the nice timeswhen we went to Mablethorpe and Robin Hoods Bay and Shanklin she said
After all not everybody has seen those beautiful places
And wasnt it beautiful
I try to think of that not of the other things
Then again for a whole evening she spoke not a word neither did he
They were together rigid stubborn silent
He went into his room at last to go to bed and leaned against the doorway as if paralysed unable to go any farther
His consciousness went
A furious storm he knew not what seemed to ravage inside him
He stood leaning there submitting never questioning
In the morning they were both normal again though her face was grey with the morphia and her body felt like ash
But they were bright again nevertheless
Often especially if Annie or Arthur were at home he neglected her
He did not see much of Clara
Usually he was with men
He was quick and active and lively but when his friends saw him go white to the gills his eyes dark and glittering they had a certain mistrust of him
Sometimes he went to Clara but she was almost cold to him
Take me
he said simply
Occasionally she would
But she was afraid
When he had her then there was something in it that made her shrink away from himsomething unnatural
She grew to dread him
He was so quiet yet so strange
She was afraid of the man who was not there with her whom she could feel behind this makebelief lover somebody sinister that filled her with horror
She began to have a kind of horror of him
It was almost as if he were a criminal
He wanted herhe had herand it made her feel as if death itself had her in its grip
She lay in horror
There was no man there loving her
She almost hated him
Then came little bouts of tenderness
But she dared not pity him
Dawes had come to Colonel Seelys Home near Nottingham
There Paul visited him sometimes Clara very occasionally
Between the two men the friendship developed peculiarly
Dawes who mended very slowly and seemed very feeble seemed to leave himself in the hands of Morel
In the beginning of November Clara reminded Paul that it was her birthday
Id nearly forgotten he said
Id thought quite she replied
No
Shall we go to the seaside for the weekend
They went
It was cold and rather dismal
She waited for him to be warm and tender with her instead of which he seemed hardly aware of her
He sat in the railwaycarriage looking out and was startled when she spoke to him
He was not definitely thinking
Things seemed as if they did not exist
She went across to him
What is it dear
she asked
Nothing
he said
Dont those windmill sails look monotonous
He sat holding her hand
He could not talk nor think
It was a comfort however to sit holding her hand
She was dissatisfied and miserable
He was not with her she was nothing
And in the evening they sat among the sandhills looking at the black heavy sea
She will never give in he said quietly
Claras heart sank
No she replied
There are different ways of dying
My fathers people are frightened and have to be hauled out of life into death like cattle into a slaughterhouse pulled by the neck but my mothers people are pushed from behind inch by inch
They are stubborn people and wont die
Yes said Clara
And she wont die
She cant
Mr Renshaw the parson was in the other day
Think
he said to her you will have your mother and father and your sisters and your son in the Other Land
And she said I have done without them for a long time and CAN do without them now
It is the living I want not the dead
She wants to live even now
Oh how horrible
said Clara too frightened to speak
And she looks at me and she wants to stay with me he went on monotonously
Shes got such a will it seems as if she would never gonever
Dont think of it
cried Clara
And she was religiousshe is religious nowbut it is no good
She simply wont give in
And do you know I said to her on Thursday Mother if I had to die Id die
Id WILL to die
And she said to me sharp Do you think I havent
Do you think you can die when you like
His voice ceased
He did not cry only went on speaking monotonously
Clara wanted to run
She looked round
There was the black reechoing shore the dark sky down on her
She got up terrified
She wanted to be where there was light where there were other people
She wanted to be away from him
He sat with his head dropped not moving a muscle
And I dont want her to eat he said and she knows it
When I ask her Shall you have anything shes almost afraid to say Yes
Ill have a cup of Bengers she says
Itll only keep your strength up I said to her
Yesand she almost criedbut theres such a gnawing when I eat nothing I cant bear it
So I went and made her the food
Its the cancer that gnaws like that at her
I wish shed die
Come
said Clara roughly
Im going
He followed her down the darkness of the sands
He did not come to her
He seemed scarcely aware of her existence
And she was afraid of him and disliked him
In the same acute daze they went back to Nottingham
He was always busy always doing something always going from one to the other of his friends
On the Monday he went to see Baxter Dawes
Listless and pale the man rose to greet the other clinging to his chair as he held out his hand
You shouldnt get up said Paul
Dawes sat down heavily eyeing Morel with a sort of suspicion
Dont you waste your time on me he said if youve owt better to do
I wanted to come said Paul
Here
I brought you some sweets
The invalid put them aside
Its not been much of a weekend said Morel
Hows your mother
asked the other
Hardly any different
I thought she was perhaps worse being as you didnt come on Sunday
I was at Skegness said Paul
I wanted a change
The other looked at him with dark eyes
He seemed to be waiting not quite daring to ask trusting to be told
I went with Clara said Paul
I knew as much said Dawes quietly
It was an old promise said Paul
You have it your own way said Dawes
This was the first time Clara had been definitely mentioned between them
Nay said Morel slowly shes tired of me
Again Dawes looked at him
Since August shes been getting tired of me Morel repeated
The two men were very quiet together
Paul suggested a game of draughts
They played in silence
I sll go abroad when my mothers dead said Paul
Abroad
repeated Dawes
Yes I dont care what I do
They continued the game
Dawes was winning
I sll have to begin a new start of some sort said Paul and you as well I suppose
He took one of Dawess pieces
I dunno where said the other
Things have to happen Morel said
Its no good doing anythingat leastno I dont know
Give me some toffee
The two men ate sweets and began another game of draughts
What made that scar on your mouth
asked Dawes
Paul put his hand hastily to his lips and looked over the garden
I had a bicycle accident he said
Dawess hand trembled as he moved the piece
You shouldnt ha laughed at me he said very low
When
That night on Woodborough Road when you and her passed meyou with your hand on her shoulder
I never laughed at you said Paul
Dawes kept his fingers on the draughtpiece
I never knew you were there till the very second when you passed said Morel
It was that as did me Dawes said very low
Paul took another sweet
I never laughed he said except as Im always laughing
They finished the game
That night Morel walked home from Nottingham in order to have something to do
The furnaces flared in a red blotch over Bulwell the black clouds were like a low ceiling
As he went along the ten miles of highroad he felt as if he were walking out of life between the black levels of the sky and the earth
But at the end was only the sickroom
If he walked and walked for ever there was only that place to come to
He was not tired when he got near home or He did not know it
Across the field he could see the red firelight leaping in her bedroom window
When shes dead he said to himself that fire will go out
He took off his boots quietly and crept upstairs
His mothers door was wide open because she slept alone still
The red firelight dashed its glow on the landing
Soft as a shadow he peeped in her doorway
Paul
she murmured
His heart seemed to break again
He went in and sat by the bed
How late you are
she murmured
Not very he said
Why what time is it
The murmur came plaintive and helpless
Its only just gone eleven
That was not true it was nearly one oclock
Oh
she said I thought it was later
And he knew the unutterable misery of her nights that would not go
Cant you sleep my pigeon
he said
No I cant she wailed
Never mind Little
He said crooning
Never mind my love
Ill stop with you half an hour my pigeon then perhaps it will be better
And he sat by the bedside slowly rhythmically stroking her brows with his fingertips stroking her eyes shut soothing her holding her fingers in his free hand
They could hear the sleepers breathing in the other rooms
Now go to bed she murmured lying quite still under his fingers and his love
Will you sleep
he asked
Yes I think so
You feel better my Little dont you
Yes she said like a fretful halfsoothed child
Still the days and the weeks went by
He hardly ever went to see Clara now
But he wandered restlessly from one person to another for some help and there was none anywhere
Miriam had written to him tenderly
He went to see her
Her heart was very sore when she saw him white gaunt with his eyes dark and bewildered
Her pity came up hurting her till she could not bear it
How is she
she asked
The samethe same
he said
The doctor says she cant last but I know she will
Shell be here at Christmas
Miriam shuddered
She drew him to her she pressed him to her bosom she kissed him and kissed him
He submitted but it was torture
She could not kiss his agony
That remained alone and apart
She kissed his face and roused his blood while his soul was apart writhing with the agony of death
And she kissed him and fingered his body till at last feeling he would go mad he got away from her
It was not what he wanted just thennot that
And she thought she had soothed him and done him good
December came and some snow
He stayed at home all the while now
They could not afford a nurse
Annie came to look after her mother the parish nurse whom they loved came in morning and evening
Paul shared the nursing with Annie
Often in the evenings when friends were in the kitchen with them they all laughed together and shook with laughter
It was reaction
Paul was so comical Annie was so quaint
The whole party laughed till they cried trying to subdue the sound
And Mrs Morel lying alone in the darkness heard them and among her bitterness was a feeling of relief
Then Paul would go upstairs gingerly guiltily to see if she had heard
Shall I give you some milk
he asked
A little she replied plaintively
And he would put some water with it so that it should not nourish her
Yet he loved her more than his own life
She had morphia every night and her heart got fitful
Annie slept beside her
Paul would go in in the early morning when his sister got up
His mother was wasted and almost ashen in the morning with the morphia
Darker and darker grew her eyes all pupil with the torture
In the mornings the weariness and ache were too much to bear
Yet she could notwould notweep or even complain much
You slept a bit later this morning little one he would say to her
Did I
she answered with fretful weariness
Yes its nearly eight oclock
He stood looking out of the window
The whole country was bleak and pallid under the snow
Then he felt her pulse
There was a strong stroke and a weak one like a sound and its echo
That was supposed to betoken the end
She let him feel her wrist knowing what he wanted
Sometimes they looked in each others eyes
Then they almost seemed to make an agreement
It was almost as if he were agreeing to die also
But she did not consent to die she would not
Her body was wasted to a fragment of ash
Her eyes were dark and full of torture
Cant you give her something to put an end to it
he asked the doctor at last
But the doctor shook his head
She cant last many days now Mr Morel he said
Paul went indoors
I cant bear it much longer we shall all go mad said Annie
The two sat down to breakfast
Go and sit with her while we have breakfast Minnie said Annie
But the girl was frightened
Paul went through the country through the woods over the snow
He saw the marks of rabbits and birds in the white snow
He wandered miles and miles
A smoky red sunset came on slowly painfully lingering
He thought she would die that day
There was a donkey that came up to him over the snow by the woods edge and put its head against him and walked with him alongside
He put his arms round the donkeys neck and stroked his cheeks against his ears
His mother silent was still alive with her hard mouth gripped grimly her eyes of dark torture only living
It was nearing Christmas there was more snow
Annie and he felt as if they could go on no more
Still her dark eyes were alive
Morel silent and frightened obliterated himself
Sometimes he would go into the sickroom and look at her
Then he backed out bewildered
She kept her hold on life still
The miners had been out on strike and returned a fortnight or so before Christmas
Minnie went upstairs with the feedingcup
It was two days after the men had been in
Have the men been saying their hands are sore Minnie
she asked in the faint querulous voice that would not give in
Minnie stood surprised
Not as I know of Mrs Morel she answered
But Ill bet they are sore said the dying woman as she moved her head with a sigh of weariness
But at any rate therell be something to buy in with this week
Not a thing did she let slip
Your fathers pit things will want well airing Annie she said when the men were going back to work
Dont you bother about that my dear said Annie
One night Annie and Paul were alone
Nurse was upstairs
Shell live over Christmas said Annie
They were both full of horror
She wont he replied grimly
I sll give her morphia
Which
said Annie
All that came from Sheffield said Paul
Aydo
said Annie
The next day he was painting in the bedroom
She seemed to be asleep
He stepped softly backwards and forwards at his painting
Suddenly her small voice wailed Dont walk about Paul
He looked round
Her eyes like dark bubbles in her face were looking at him
No my dear he said gently
Another fibre seemed to snap in his heart
That evening he got all the morphia pills there were and took them downstairs
Carefully he crushed them to powder
What are you doing
said Annie
I sll put em in her night milk
Then they both laughed together like two conspiring children
On top of all their horror flicked this little sanity
Nurse did not come that night to settle Mrs Morel down
Paul went up with the hot milk in a feedingcup
It was nine oclock
She was reared up in bed and he put the feedingcup between her lips that he would have died to save from any hurt
She took a sip then put the spout of the cup away and looked at him with her dark wondering eyes
He looked at her
Oh it IS bitter Paul
she said making a little grimace
Its a new sleeping draught the doctor gave me for you he said
He thought it would leave you in such a state in the morning
And I hope it wont she said like a child
She drank some more of the milk
But it IS horrid
she said
He saw her frail fingers over the cup her lips making a little move
I knowI tasted it he said
But Ill give you some clean milk afterwards
I think so she said and she went on with the draught
She was obedient to him like a child
He wondered if she knew
He saw her poor wasted throat moving as she drank with difficulty
Then he ran downstairs for more milk
There were no grains in the bottom of the cup
Has she had it
whispered Annie
Yesand she said it was bitter
Oh
laughed Annie putting her under lip between her teeth
And I told her it was a new draught
Wheres that milk
They both went upstairs
I wonder why nurse didnt come to settle me down
complained the mother like a child wistfully
She said she was going to a concert my love replied Annie
Did she
They were silent a minute
Mrs Morel gulped the little clean milk
Annie that draught WAS horrid
she said plaintively
Was it my love
Well never mind
The mother sighed again with weariness
Her pulse was very irregular
Let US settle you down said Annie
Perhaps nurse will be so late
Ay said the mothertry
They turned the clothes back
Paul saw his mother LIke a girl curled up in her flannel nightdress
Quickly they made one half of the bed moved her made the other straightened her nightgown over her small feet and covered her up
There said Paul stroking her softly
Therenow youll sleep
Yes she said
I didnt think you could do the bed so nicely she added almost gaily
Then she curled up with her cheek on her hand her head snugged between her shoulders
Paul put the long thin plait of grey hair over her shoulder and kissed her
Youll sleep my love he said
Yes she answered trustfully
Goodnight
They put out the light and it was still
Morel was in bed
Nurse did not come
Annie and Paul came to look at her at about eleven
She seemed to be sleeping as usual after her draught
Her mouth had come a bit open
Shall we sit up
said Paul
I sll lie with her as I always do said Annie
She might wake up
All right
And call me if you see any difference
Yes
They lingered before the bedroom fire feeling the night big and black and snowy outside their two selves alone in the world
At last he went into the next room and went to bed
He slept almost immediately but kept waking every now and again
Then he went sound asleep
He started awake at Annies whispered Paul Paul
He saw his sister in her white nightdress with her long plait of hair down her back standing in the darkness
Yes
he whispered sitting up
Come and look at her
He slipped out of bed
A bud of gas was burning in the sick chamber
His mother lay with her cheek on her hand curled up as she had gone to sleep
But her mouth had fallen open and she breathed with great hoarse breaths like snoring and there were long intervals between
Shes going
he whispered
Yes said Annie
How long has she been like it
I only just woke up
Annie huddled into the dressinggown Paul wrapped himself in a brown blanket
It was three oclock
He mended the fire
Then the two sat waiting
The great snoring breath was takenheld awhilethen given back
There was a spacea long space
Then they started
The great snoring breath was taken again
He bent close down and looked at her
Isnt it awful
whispered Annie
He nodded
They sat down again helplessly
Again came the great snoring breath
Again they hung suspended
Again it was given back long and harsh
The sound so irregular at such wide intervals sounded through the house
Morel in his room slept on
Paul and Annie sat crouched huddled motionless
The great snoring sound began againthere was a painful pause while the breath was heldback came the rasping breath
Minute after minute passed
Paul looked at her again bending low over her
She may last like this he said
They were both silent
He looked out of the window and could faintly discern the snow on the garden
You go to my bed he said to Annie
Ill sit up
No she said Ill stop with you
Id rather you didnt he said
At last Annie crept out of the room and he was alone
He hugged himself in his brown blanket crouched in front of his mother watching
She looked dreadful with the bottom jaw fallen back
He watched
Sometimes he thought the great breath would never begin again
He could not bear itthe waiting
Then suddenly startling him came the great harsh sound
He mended the fire again noiselessly
She must not be disturbed
The minutes went by
The night was going breath by breath
Each time the sound came he felt it wring him till at last he could not feel so much
His father got up
Paul heard the miner drawing his stockings on yawning
Then Morel in shirt and stockings entered
Hush
said Paul
Morel stood watching
Then he looked at his son helplessly and in horror
Had I better stop awhoam
he whispered
No
Go to work
Shell last through tomorrow
I dont think so
Yes
Go to work
The miner looked at her again in fear and went obediently out of the room
Paul saw the tape of his garters swinging against his legs
After another halfhour Paul went downstairs and drank a cup of tea then returned
Morel dressed for the pit came upstairs again
Am I to go
he said
Yes
And in a few minutes Paul heard his fathers heavy steps go thudding over the deadening snow
Miners called in the streets as they tramped in gangs to work
The terrible longdrawn breaths continuedheaveheaveheave then a long pausethenahhhhh
as it came back
Far away over the snow sounded the hooters of the ironworks
One after another they crowed and boomed some small and far away some near the blowers of the collieries and the other works
Then there was silence
He mended the fire
The great breaths broke the silenceshe looked just the same
He put back the blind and peered out
Still it was dark
Perhaps there was a lighter tinge
Perhaps the snow was bluer
He drew up the blind and got dressed
Then shuddering he drank brandy from the bottle on the washstand
The snow WAS growing blue
He heard a cart clanking down the street
Yes it was seven oclock and it was coming a little bit light
He heard some people calling
The world was waking
A grey deathly dawn crept over the snow
Yes he could see the houses
He put out the gas
It seemed very dark
The breathing came still but he was almost used to it
He could see her
She was just the same
He wondered if he piled heavy clothes on top of her it would stop
He looked at her
That was not hernot her a bit
If he piled the blanket and heavy coats on her Suddenly the door opened and Annie entered
She looked at him questioningly
Just the same he said calmly
They whispered together a minute then he went downstairs to get breakfast
It was twenty to eight
Soon Annie came down
Isnt it awful
Doesnt she look awful
she whispered dazed with horror
He nodded
If she looks like that
said Annie
Drink some tea he said
They went upstairs again
Soon the neighbours came with their frightened question How is she
It went on just the same
She lay with her cheek in her hand her mouth fallen open and the great ghastly snores came and went
At ten oclock nurse came
She looked strange and woebegone
Nurse cried Paul shell last like this for days
She cant Mr Morel said nurse
She cant
There was a silence
Isnt it dreadful
wailed the nurse
Who would have thought she could stand it
Go down now Mr Morel go down
At last at about eleven oclock he went downstairs and sat in the neighbours house
Annie was downstairs also
Nurse and Arthur were upstairs
Paul sat with his head in his hand
Suddenly Annie came flying across the yard crying half mad PaulPaulshes gone
In a second he was back in his own house and upstairs
She lay curled up and still with her face on her hand and nurse was wiping her mouth
They all stood back
He kneeled down and put his face to hers and his arms round her My lovemy loveoh my love
he whispered again and again
My loveoh my love
Then he heard the nurse behind him crying saying Shes better Mr Morel shes better
When he took his face up from his warm dead mother he went straight downstairs and began blacking his boots
There was a good deal to do letters to write and so on
The doctor came and glanced at her and sighed
Aypoor thing
he said then turned away
Well call at the surgery about six for the certificate
The father came home from work at about four oclock
He dragged silently into the house and sat down
Minnie bustled to give him his dinner
Tired he laid his black arms on the table
There were swede turnips for his dinner which he liked
Paul wondered if he knew
It was some time and nobody had spoken
At last the son said You noticed the blinds were down
Morel looked up
No he said
Whyhas she gone
Yes
When wor that
About twelve this morning
Hm
The miner sat still for a moment then began his dinner
It was as if nothing had happened
He ate his turnips in silence
Afterwards he washed and went upstairs to dress
The door of her room was shut
Have you seen her
Annie asked of him when he came down
No he said
In a little while he went out
Annie went away and Paul called on the undertaker the clergyman the doctor the registrar
It was a long business
He got back at nearly eight oclock
The undertaker was coming soon to measure for the coffin
The house was empty except for her
He took a candle and went upstairs
The room was cold that had been warm for so long
Flowers bottles plates all sickroom litter was taken away everything was harsh and austere
She lay raised on the bed the sweep of the sheet from the raised feet was like a clean curve of snow so silent
She lay like a maiden asleep
With his candle in his hand he bent over her
She lay like a girl asleep and dreaming of her love
The mouth was a little open as if wondering from the suffering but her face was young her brow clear and white as if life had never touched it
He looked again at the eyebrows at the small winsome nose a bit on one side
She was young again
Only the hair as it arched so beautifully from her temples was mixed with silver and the two simple plaits that lay on her shoulders were filigree of silver and brown
She would wake up
She would lift her eyelids
She was with him still
He bent and kissed her passionately
But there was coldness against his mouth
He bit his lips with horror
Looking at her he felt he could never never let her go
No
He stroked the hair from her temples
That too was cold
He saw the mouth so dumb and wondering at the hurt
Then he crouched on the floor whispering to her Mother mother
He was still with her when the undertakers came young men who had been to school with him
They touched her reverently and in a quiet businesslike fashion
They did not look at her
He watched jealously
He and Annie guarded her fiercely
They would not let anybody come to see her and the neighbours were offended
After a while Paul went out of the house and played cards at a friends
It was midnight when he got back
His father rose from the couch as he entered saying in a plaintive way I thought tha wor niver comin lad
I didnt think youd sit up said Paul
His father looked so forlorn
Morel had been a man without fearsimply nothing frightened him
Paul realised with a start that he had been afraid to go to bed alone in the house with his dead
He was sorry
I forgot youd be alone father he said
Dost want owt to eat
asked Morel
No
SitheeI made thee a drop o hot milk
Get it down thee its cold enough for owt
Paul drank it
After a while Morel went to bed
He hurried past the closed door and left his own door open
Soon the son came upstairs also
He went in to kiss her goodnight as usual
It was cold and dark
He wished they had kept her fire burning
Still she dreamed her young dream
But she would be cold
My dear
he whispered
My dear
And he did not kiss her for fear she should be cold and strange to him
It eased him she slept so beautifully
He shut her door softly not to wake her and went to bed
In the morning Morel summoned his courage hearing Annie downstairs and Paul coughing in the room across the landing
He opened her door and went into the darkened room
He saw the white uplifted form in the twilight but her he dared not see
Bewildered too frightened to possess any of his faculties he got out of the room again and left her
He never looked at her again
He had not seen her for months because he had not dared to look
And she looked like his young wife again
Have you seen her
Annie asked of him sharply after breakfast
Yes he said
And dont you think she looks nice
Yes
He went out of the house soon after
And all the time He seemed to be creeping aside to avoid it
Paul went about from place to place doing the business of the death
He met Clara in Nottingham and they had tea together in a cafe when they were quite jolly again
She was infinitely relieved to find he did not take it tragically
Later when the relatives began to come for the funeral the affair became public and the children became social beings
They put themselves aside
They buried her in a furious storm of rain and wind
The wet clay glistened all the white flowers were soaked
Annie gripped his arm and leaned forward
Down below she saw a dark corner of Williams coffin
The oak box sank steadily
She was gone
The rain poured in the grave
The procession of black with its umbrellas glistening turned away
The cemetery was deserted under the drenching cold rain
Paul went home and busied himself supplying the guests with drinks
His father sat in the kitchen with Mrs Morels relatives superior people and wept and said what a good lass shed been and how hed tried to do everything he could for hereverything
He had striven all his life to do what he could for her and hed nothing to reproach himself with
She was gone but hed done his best for her
He wiped his eyes with his white handkerchief
Hed nothing to reproach himself for he repeated
All his life hed done his best for her
And that was how he tried to dismiss her
He never thought of her personally
Everything deep in him he denied
Paul hated his father for sitting sentimentalising over her
He knew he would do it in the publichouses
For the real tragedy went on in Morel in spite of himself
Sometimes later he came down from his afternoon sleep white and cowering
I HAVE been dreaming of thy mother he said in a small voice
Have you father
When I dream of her its always just as she was when she was well
I dream of her often but it seems quite nice and natural as if nothing had altered
But Morel crouched in front of the fire in terror
The weeks passed halfreal not much pain not much of anything perhaps a little relief mostly a nuit blanche
Paul went restless from place to place
For some months since his mother had been worse he had not made love to Clara
She was as it were dumb to him rather distant
Dawes saw her very occasionally but the two could not get an inch across the great distance between them
The three of them were drifting forward
Dawes mended very slowly
He was in the convalescent home at Skegness at Christmas nearly well again
Paul went to the seaside for a few days
His father was with Annie in Sheffield
Dawes came to Pauls lodgings
His time in the home was up
The two men between whom was such a big reserve seemed faithful to each other
Dawes depended on Morel now
He knew Paul and Clara had practically separated
Two days after Christmas Paul was to go back to Nottingham
The evening before he sat with Dawes smoking before the fire
You know Claras coming down for the day tomorrow
he said
The other man glanced at him
Yes you told me he replied
Paul drank the remainder of his glass of whisky
I told the landlady your wife was coming he said
Did you
said Dawes shrinking but almost leaving himself in the others hands
He got up rather stiffly and reached for Morels glass
Let me fill you up he said
Paul jumped up
You sit still he said
But Dawes with rather shaky hand continued to mix the drink
Say when he said
Thanks
replied the other
But youve no business to get up
It does me good lad replied Dawes
I begin to think Im right again then
You are about right you know
I am certainly I am said Dawes nodding to him
And Len says he can get you on in Sheffield
Dawes glanced at him again with dark eyes that agreed with everything the other would say perhaps a trifle dominated by him
Its funny said Paul starting again
I feel in a lot bigger mess than you
In what way lad
I dont know
I dont know
Its as if I was in a tangled sort of hole rather dark and dreary and no road anywhere
I knowI understand it Dawes said nodding
But youll find itll come all right
He spoke caressingly
I suppose so said Paul
Dawes knocked his pipe in a hopeless fashion
Youve not done for yourself like I have he said
Morel saw the wrist and the white hand of the other man gripping the stem of the pipe and knocking out the ash as if he had given up
How old are you
Paul asked
Thirtynine replied Dawes glancing at him
Those brown eyes full of the consciousness of failure almost pleading for reassurance for someone to reestablish the man in himself to warm him to set him up firm again troubled Paul
Youll just be in your prime said Morel
You dont look as if much life had gone out of you
The brown eyes of the other flashed suddenly
It hasnt he said
The go is there
Paul looked up and laughed
Weve both got plenty of life in us yet to make things fly he said
The eyes of the two men met
They exchanged one look
Having recognised the stress of passion each in the other they both drank their whisky
Yes begod
said Dawes breathless
There was a pause
And I dont see said Paul why you shouldnt go on where you left off
What said Dawes suggestively
Yesfit your old home together again
Dawes hid his face and shook his head
Couldnt be done he said and looked up with an ironic smile
Why
Because you dont want
Perhaps
They smoked in silence
Dawes showed his teeth as he bit his pipe stem
You mean you dont want her
asked Paul
Dawes stared up at the picture with a caustic expression on his face
I hardly know he said
The smoke floated softly up
I believe she wants you said Paul
Do you
replied the other soft satirical abstract
Yes
She never really hitched on to meyou were always there in the background
Thats why she wouldnt get a divorce
Dawes continued to stare in a satirical fashion at the picture over the mantelpiece
Thats how women are with me said Paul
They want me like mad but they dont want to belong to me
And she BELONGED to you all the time
I knew
The triumphant male came up in Dawes
He showed his teeth more distinctly
Perhaps I was a fool he said
You were a big fool said Morel
But perhaps even THEN you were a bigger fool said Dawes
There was a touch of triumph and malice in it
Do you think so
said Paul
They were silent for some time
At any rate Im clearing out tomorrow said Morel
I see answered Dawes
Then they did not talk any more
The instinct to murder each other had returned
They almost avoided each other
They shared the same bedroom
When they retired Dawes seemed abstract thinking of something
He sat on the side of the bed in his shirt looking at his legs
Arent you getting cold
asked Morel
I was lookin at these legs replied the other
Whats up with em
They look all right replied Paul from his bed
They look all right
But theres some water in em yet
And what about it
Come and look
Paul reluctantly got out of bed and went to look at the rather handsome legs of the other man that were covered with glistening dark gold hair
Look here said Dawes pointing to his shin
Look at the water under here
Where
said Paul
The man pressed in his fingertips
They left little dents that filled up slowly
Its nothing said Paul
You feel said Dawes
Paul tried with his fingers
It made little dents
Hm
he said
Rotten isnt it
said Dawes
Why
Its nothing much
Youre not much of a man with water in your legs
I cant see as it makes any difference said Morel
Ive got a weak chest
He returned to his own bed
I suppose the rest of mes all right said Dawes and he put out the light
In the morning it was raining
Morel packed his bag
The sea was grey and shaggy and dismal
He seemed to be cutting himself off from life more and more
It gave him a wicked pleasure to do it
The two men were at the station
Clara stepped out of the train and came along the platform very erect and coldly composed
She wore a long coat and a tweed hat
Both men hated her for her composure
Paul shook hands with her at the barrier
Dawes was leaning against the bookstall watching
His black overcoat was buttoned up to the chin because of the rain
He was pale with almost a touch of nobility in his quietness
He came forward limping slightly
You ought to look better than this she said
Oh Im all right now
The three stood at a loss
She kept the two men hesitating near her
Shall we go to the lodging straight off said Paul or somewhere else
We may as well go home said Dawes
Paul walked on the outside of the pavement then Dawes then Clara
They made polite conversation
The sittingroom faced the sea whose tide grey and shaggy hissed not far off
Morel swung up the big armchair
Sit down Jack he said
I dont want that chair said Dawes
Sit down
Morel repeated
Clara took off her things and laid them on the couch
She had a slight air of resentment
Lifting her hair with her fingers she sat down rather aloof and composed
Paul ran downstairs to speak to the landlady
I should think youre cold said Dawes to his wife
Come nearer to the fire
Thank you Im quite warm she answered
She looked out of the window at the rain and at the sea
When are you going back
she asked
Well the rooms are taken until tomorrow so he wants me to stop
Hes going back tonight
And then youre thinking of going to Sheffield
Yes
Are you fit to start work
Im going to start
Youve really got a place
Yesbegin on Monday
You dont look fit
Why dont I
She looked again out of the window instead of answering
And have you got lodgings in Sheffield
Yes
Again she looked away out of the window
The panes were blurred with streaming rain
And can you manage all right
she asked
I sd think so
I sll have to
They were silent when Morel returned
I shall go by the fourtwenty he said as he entered
Nobody answered
I wish youd take your boots off he said to Clara
Theres a pair of slippers of mine
Thank you she said
They arent wet
He put the slippers near her feet
She left them there
Morel sat down
Both the men seemed helpless and each of them had a rather hunted look
But Dawes now carried himself quietly seemed to yield himself while Paul seemed to screw himself up
Clara thought she had never seen him look so small and mean
He was as if trying to get himself into the smallest possible compass
And as he went about arranging and as he sat talking there seemed something false about him and out of tune
Watching him unknown she said to herself there was no stability about him
He was fine in his way passionate and able to give her drinks of pure life when he was in one mood
And now he looked paltry and insignificant
There was nothing stable about him
Her husband had more manly dignity
At any rate HE did not waft about with any wind
There was something evanescent about Morel she thought something shifting and false
He would never make sure ground for any woman to stand on
She despised him rather for his shrinking together getting smaller
Her husband at least was manly and when he was beaten gave in
But this other would never own to being beaten
He would shift round and round prowl get smaller
She despised him
And yet she watched him rather than Dawes and it seemed as if their three fates lay in his hands
She hated him for it
She seemed to understand better now about men and what they could or would do
She was less afraid of them more sure of herself
That they were not the small egoists she had imagined them made her more comfortable
She had learned a good dealalmost as much as she wanted to learn
Her cup had been full
It was still as full as she could carry
On the whole she would not be sorry when he was gone
They had dinner and sat eating nuts and drinking by the fire
Not a serious word had been spoken
Yet Clara realised that Morel was withdrawing from the circle leaving her the option to stay with her husband
It angered her
He was a mean fellow after all to take what he wanted and then give her back
She did not remember that she herself had had what she wanted and really at the bottom of her heart wished to be given back
Paul felt crumpled up and lonely
His mother had really supported his life
He had loved her they two had in fact faced the world together
Now she was gone and for ever behind him was the gap in life the tear in the veil through which his life seemed to drift slowly as if he were drawn towards death
He wanted someone of their own free initiative to help him
The lesser things he began to let go from him for fear of this big thing the lapse towards death following in the wake of his beloved
Clara could not stand for him to hold on to
She wanted him but not to understand him
He felt she wanted the man on top not the real him that was in trouble
That would be too much trouble to her he dared not give it her
She could not cope with him
It made him ashamed
So secretly ashamed because he was in such a mess because his own hold on life was so unsure because nobody held him feeling unsubstantial shadowy as if he did not count for much in this concrete world he drew himself together smaller and smaller
He did not want to die he would not give in
But he was not afraid of death
If nobody would help he would go on alone
Dawes had been driven to the extremity of life until he was afraid
He could go to the brink of death he could lie on the edge and look in
Then cowed afraid he had to crawl back and like a beggar take what offered
There was a certain nobility in it
As Clara saw he owned himself beaten and he wanted to be taken back whether or not
That she could do for him
It was three oclock
I am going by the fourtwenty said Paul again to Clara
Are you coming then or later
I dont know she said
Im meeting my father in Nottingham at sevenfifteen he said
Then she answered Ill come later
Dawes jerked suddenly as if he had been held on a strain
He looked out over the sea but he saw nothing
There are one or two books in the corner said Morel
Ive done with em
At about four oclock he went
I shall see you both later he said as he shook hands
I suppose so said Dawes
An perhapsone dayI sll be able to pay you back the money as I shall come for it youll see laughed Paul
I sll be on the rocks before Im very much older
Aywell said Dawes
Goodbye he said to Clara
Goodbye she said giving him her hand
Then she glanced at him for the last time dumb and humble
He was gone
Dawes and his wife sat down again
Its a nasty day for travelling said the man
Yes she answered
They talked in a desultory fashion until it grew dark
The landlady brought in the tea
Dawes drew up his chair to the table without being invited like a husband
Then he sat humbly waiting for his cup
She served him as she would like a wife not consulting his wish
After tea as it drew near to six oclock he went to the window
All was dark outside
The sea was roaring
Its raining yet he said
Is it
she answered
You wont go tonight shall you
he said hesitating
She did not answer
He waited
I shouldnt go in this rain he said
Do you WANT me to stay
she asked
His hand as he held the dark curtain trembled
Yes he said
He remained with his back to her
She rose and went slowly to him
He let go the curtain turned hesitating towards her
She stood with her hands behind her back looking up at him in a heavy inscrutable fashion
Do you want me Baxter
she asked
His voice was hoarse as he answered Do you want to come back to me
She made a moaning noise lifted her arms and put them round his neck drawing him to her
He hid his face on her shoulder holding her clasped
Take me back
she whispered ecstatic
Take me back take me back
And she put her fingers through his fine thin dark hair as if she were only semiconscious
He tightened his grasp on her
Do you want me again
he murmured broken
CHAPTER XV DERELICT CLARA went with her husband to Sheffield and Paul scarcely saw her again
Walter Morel seemed to have let all the trouble go over him and there he was crawling about on the mud of it just the same
There was scarcely any bond between father and son save that each felt he must not let the other go in any actual want
As there was no one to keep on the home and as they could neither of them bear the emptiness of the house Paul took lodgings in Nottingham and Morel went to live with a friendly family in Bestwood
Everything seemed to have gone smash for the young man
He could not paint
The picture he finished on the day of his mothers deathone that satisfied himwas the last thing he did
At work there was no Clara
When he came home he could not take up his brushes again
There was nothing left
So he was always in the town at one place or another drinking knocking about with the men he knew
It really wearied him
He talked to barmaids to almost any woman but there was that dark strained look in his eyes as if he were hunting something
Everything seemed so different so unreal
There seemed no reason why people should go along the street and houses pile up in the daylight
There seemed no reason why these things should occupy the space instead of leaving it empty
His friends talked to him he heard the sounds and he answered
But why there should be the noise of speech he could not understand
He was most himself when he was alone or working hard and mechanically at the factory
In the latter case there was pure forgetfulness when he lapsed from consciousness
But it had to come to an end
It hurt him so that things had lost their reality
The first snowdrops came
He saw the tiny droppearls among the grey
They would have given him the liveliest emotion at one time
Now they were there but they did not seem to mean anything
In a few moments they would cease to occupy that place and just the space would be where they had been
Tall brilliant tramcars ran along the street at night
It seemed almost a wonder they should trouble to rustle backwards and forwards
Why trouble to go tilting down to Trent Bridges
he asked of the big trams
It seemed they just as well might NOT be as be
The realest thing was the thick darkness at night
That seemed to him whole and comprehensible and restful
He could leave himself to it
Suddenly a piece of paper started near his feet and blew along down the pavement
He stood still rigid with clenched fists a flame of agony going over him
And he saw again the sickroom his mother her eyes
Unconsciously he had been with her in her company
The swift hop of the paper reminded him she was gone
But he had been with her
He wanted everything to stand still so that he could be with her again
The days passed the weeks
But everything seemed to have fused gone into a conglomerated mass
He could not tell one day from another one week from another hardly one place from another
Nothing was distinct or distinguishable
Often he lost himself for an hour at a time could not remember what he had done
One evening he came home late to his lodging
The fire was burning low everybody was in bed
He threw on some more coal glanced at the table and decided he wanted no supper
Then he sat down in the armchair
It was perfectly still
He did not know anything yet he saw the dim smoke wavering up the chimney
Presently two mice came out cautiously nibbling the fallen crumbs
He watched them as it were from a long way off
The church clock struck two
Far away he could hear the sharp clinking of the trucks on the railway
No it was not they that were far away
They were there in their places
But where was he himself
The time passed
The two mice careering wildly scampered cheekily over his slippers
He had not moved a muscle
He did not want to move
He was not thinking of anything
It was easier so
There was no wrench of knowing anything
Then from time to time some other consciousness working mechanically flashed into sharp phrases
What am I doing
And out of the semiintoxicated trance came the answer Destroying myself
Then a dull live feeling gone in an instant told him that it was wrong
After a while suddenly came the question Why wrong
Again there was no answer but a stroke of hot stubbornness inside his chest resisted his own annihilation
There was a sound of a heavy cart clanking down the road
Suddenly the electric light went out there was a bruising thud in the pennyintheslot meter
He did not stir but sat gazing in front of him
Only the mice had scuttled and the fire glowed red in the dark room
Then quite mechanically and more distinctly the conversation began again inside him
Shes dead
What was it all forher struggle
That was his despair wanting to go after her
Youre alive
Shes not
She isin you
Suddenly he felt tired with the burden of it
Youve got to keep alive for her sake said his will in him
Something felt sulky as if it would not rouse
Youve got to carry forward her living and what she had done go on with it
But he did not want to
He wanted to give up
But you can go on with your painting said the will in him
Or else you can beget children
They both carry on her effort
Painting is not living
Then live
Marry whom
came the sulky question
As best you can
Miriam
But he did not trust that
He rose suddenly went straight to bed
When he got inside his bedroom and closed the door he stood with clenched fist
Mater my dear he began with the whole force of his soul
Then he stopped
He would not say it
He would not admit that he wanted to die to have done
He would not own that life had beaten him or that death had beaten him
Going straight to bed he slept at once abandoning himself to the sleep
So the weeks went on
Always alone his soul oscillated first on the side of death then on the side of life doggedly
The real agony was that he had nowhere to go nothing to do nothing to say and WAS nothing himself
Sometimes he ran down the streets as if he were mad sometimes he was mad things werent there things were there
It made him pant
Sometimes he stood before the bar of the publichouse where he called for a drink
Everything suddenly stood back away from him
He saw the face of the barmaid the gobbling drinkers his own glass on the slopped mahogany board in the distance
There was something between him and them
He could not get into touch
He did not want them he did not want his drink
Turning abruptly he went out
On the threshold he stood and looked at the lighted street
But he was not of it or in it
Something separated him
Everything went on there below those lamps shut away from him
He could not get at them
He felt he couldnt touch the lampposts not if he reached
Where could he go
There was nowhere to go neither back into the inn or forward anywhere
He felt stifled
There was nowhere for him
The stress grew inside him he felt he should smash
I mustnt he said and turning blindly he went in and drank
Sometimes the drink did him good sometimes it made him worse
He ran down the road
For ever restless he went here there everywhere
He determined to work
But when he had made six strokes he loathed the pencil violently got up and went away hurried off to a club where he could play cards or billiards to a place where he could flirt with a barmaid who was no more to him than the brass pumphandle she drew
He was very thin and lanternjawed
He dared not meet his own eyes in the mirror he never looked at himself
He wanted to get away from himself but there was nothing to get hold of
In despair he thought of Miriam
Perhapsperhaps
Then happening to go into the Unitarian Church one Sunday evening when they stood up to sing the second hymn he saw her before him
The light glistened on her lower lip as she sang
She looked as if she had got something at any rate some hope in heaven if not in earth
Her comfort and her life seemed in the afterworld
A warm strong feeling for her came up
She seemed to yearn as she sang for the mystery and comfort
He put his hope in her
He longed for the sermon to be over to speak to her
The throng carried her out just before him
He could nearly touch her
She did not know he was there
He saw the brown humble nape of her neck under its black curls
He would leave himself to her
She was better and bigger than he
He would depend on her
She went wandering in her blind way through the little throngs of people outside the church
She always looked so lost and out of place among people
He went forward and put his hand on her arm
She started violently
Her great brown eyes dilated in fear then went questioning at the sight of him
He shrank slightly from her
I didnt know she faltered
Nor I he said
He looked away
His sudden flaring hope sank again
What are you doing in town
he asked
Im staying at Cousin Annes
Ha
For long
No only till tomorrow
Must you go straight home
She looked at him then hid her face under her hatbrim
No she saidno its not necessary
He turned away and she went with him
They threaded through the throng of church people
The organ was still sounding in St Marys
Dark figures came through the lighted doors people were coming down the steps
The large coloured windows glowed up in the night
The church was like a great lantern suspended
They went down Hollow Stone and he took the car for the Bridges
You will just have supper with me he said then Ill bring you back
Very well she replied low and husky
They scarcely spoke while they were on the car
The Trent ran dark and full under the bridge
Away towards Colwick all was black night
He lived down Holme Road on the naked edge of the town facing across the river meadows towards Sneinton Hermitage and the steep scrap of Colwick Wood
The floods were out
The silent water and the darkness spread away on their left
Almost afraid they hurried along by the houses
Supper was laid
He swung the curtain over the window
There was a bowl of freesias and scarlet anemones on the table
She bent to them
Still touching them with her fingertips she looked up at him saying Arent they beautiful
Yes he said
What will you drinkcoffee
I should like it she said
Then excuse me a moment
He went out to the kitchen
Miriam took off her things and looked round
It was a bare severe room
Her photo Claras Annies were on the wall
She looked on the drawingboard to see what he was doing
There were only a few meaningless lines
She looked to see what books he was reading
Evidently just an ordinary novel
The letters in the rack she saw were from Annie Arthur and from some man or other she did not know
Everything he had touched everything that was in the least personal to him she examined with lingering absorption
He had been gone from her for so long she wanted to rediscover him his position what he was now
But there was not much in the room to help her
It only made her feel rather sad it was so hard and comfortless
She was curiously examining a sketchbook when he returned with the coffee
Theres nothing new in it he said and nothing very interesting
He put down the tray and went to look over her shoulder
She turned the pages slowly intent on examining everything
Hm
he said as she paused at a sketch
Id forgotten that
Its not bad is it
No she said
I dont quite understand it
He took the book from her and went through it
Again he made a curious sound of surprise and pleasure
Theres some not bad stuff in there he said
Not at all bad she answered gravely
He felt again her interest in his work
Or was it for himself
Why was she always most interested in him as he appeared in his work
They sat down to supper
By the way he said didnt I hear something about your earning your own living
Yes she replied bowing her dark head over her cup
And what of it
Im merely going to the farming college at Broughton for three months and I shall probably be kept on as a teacher there
I saythat sounds all right for you
You always wanted to be independent
Yes
Why didnt you tell me
I only knew last week
But I heard a month ago he said
Yes but nothing was settled then
I should have thought he said youd have told me you were trying
She ate her food in the deliberate constrained way almost as if she recoiled a little from doing anything so publicly that he knew so well
I suppose youre glad he said
Very glad
Yesit will be something
He was rather disappointed
I think it will be a great deal she said almost haughtily resentfully
He laughed shortly
Why do you think it wont
she asked
Oh I dont think it wont be a great deal
Only youll find earning your own living isnt everything
No she said swallowing with difficulty I dont suppose it is
I suppose work CAN be nearly everything to a man he said though it isnt to me
But a woman only works with a part of herself
The real and vital part is covered up
But a man can give ALL himself to work
she asked
Yes practically
And a woman only the unimportant part of herself
Thats it
She looked up at him and her eyes dilated with anger
Then she said if its true its a great shame
It is
But I dont know everything he answered
After supper they drew up to the fire
He swung her a chair facing him and they sat down
She was wearing a dress of dark claret colour that suited her dark complexion and her large features
Still the curls were fine and free but her face was much older the brown throat much thinner
She seemed old to him older than Clara
Her bloom of youth had quickly gone
A sort of stiffness almost of woodenness had come upon her
She meditated a little while then looked at him
And how are things with you
she asked
About all right he answered
She looked at him waiting
Nay she said very low
Her brown nervous hands were clasped over her knee
They had still the lack of confidence or repose the almost hysterical look
He winced as he saw them
Then he laughed mirthlessly
She put her fingers between her lips
His slim black tortured body lay quite still in the chair
She suddenly took her finger from her mouth and looked at him
And you have broken off with Clara
Yes
His body lay like an abandoned thing strewn in the chair
You know she said I think we ought to be married
He opened his eyes for the first time since many months and attended to her with respect
Why
he said
See she said how you waste yourself
You might be ill you might die and I never knowbe no more then than if I had never known you
And if we married
he asked
At any rate I could prevent you wasting yourself and being a prey to other womenlikelike Clara
A prey
he repeated smiling
She bowed her head in silence
He lay feeling his despair come up again
Im not sure he said slowly that marriage would be much good
I only think of you she replied
I know you do
Butyou love me so much you want to put me in your pocket
And I should die there smothered
She bent her head put her fingers between her lips while the bitterness surged up in her heart
And what will you do otherwise
she asked
I dont knowgo on I suppose
Perhaps I shall soon go abroad
The despairing doggedness in his tone made her go on her knees on the rug before the fire very near to him
There she crouched as if she were crushed by something and could not raise her head
His hands lay quite inert on the arms of his chair
She was aware of them
She felt that now he lay at her mercy
If she could rise take him put her arms round him and say You are mine then he would leave himself to her
But dare she
She could easily sacrifice herself
But dare she assert herself
She was aware of his darkclothed slender body that seemed one stroke of life sprawled in the chair close to her
But no she dared not put her arms round it take it up and say It is mine this body
Leave it to me
And she wanted to
It called to all her womans instinct
But she crouched and dared not
She was afraid he would not let her
She was afraid it was too much
It lay there his body abandoned
She knew she ought to take it up and claim it and claim every right to it
Butcould she do it
Her impotence before him before the strong demand of some unknown thing in him was her extremity
Her hands fluttered she halflifted her head
Her eyes shuddering appealing gone almost distracted pleaded to him suddenly
His heart caught with pity
He took her hands drew her to him and comforted her
Will you have me to marry me
he said very low
Oh why did not he take her
Her very soul belonged to him
Why would he not take what was his
She had borne so long the cruelty of belonging to him and not being claimed by him
Now he was straining her again
It was too much for her
She drew back her head held his face between her hands and looked him in the eyes
No he was hard
He wanted something else
She pleaded to him with all her love not to make it her choice
She could not cope with it with him she knew not with what
But it strained her till she felt she would break
Do you want it
she asked very gravely
Not much he replied with pain
She turned her face aside then raising herself with dignity she took his head to her bosom and rocked him softly
She was not to have him then
So she could comfort him
She put her fingers through his hair
For her the anguished sweetness of selfsacrifice
For him the hate and misery of another failure
He could not bear itthat breast which was warm and which cradled him without taking the burden of him
So much he wanted to rest on her that the feint of rest only tortured him
He drew away
And without marriage we can do nothing
he asked
His mouth was lifted from his teeth with pain
She put her little finger between her lips
No she said low and like the toll of a bell
No I think not
It was the end then between them
She could not take him and relieve him of the responsibility of himself
She could only sacrifice herself to himsacrifice herself every day gladly
And that he did not want
He wanted her to hold him and say with joy and authority Stop all this restlessness and beating against death
You are mine for a mate
She had not the strength
Or was it a mate she wanted
or did she want a Christ in him
He felt in leaving her he was defrauding her of life
But he knew that in staying stilling the inner desperate man he was denying his own life
And he did not hope to give life to her by denying his own
She sat very quiet
He lit a cigarette
The smoke went up from it wavering
He was thinking of his mother and had forgotten Miriam
She suddenly looked at him
Her bitterness came surging up
Her sacrifice then was useless
He lay there aloof careless about her
Suddenly she saw again his lack of religion his restless instability
He would destroy himself like a perverse child
Well then he would
I think I must go she said softly
By her tone he knew she was despising him
He rose quietly
Ill come along with you he answered
She stood before the mirror pinning on her hat
How bitter how unutterably bitter it made her that he rejected her sacrifice
Life ahead looked dead as if the glow were gone out
She bowed her face over the flowersthe freesias so sweet and springlike the scarlet anemones flaunting over the table
It was like him to have those flowers
He moved about the room with a certain sureness of touch swift and relentless and quiet
She knew she could not cope with him
He would escape like a weasel out of her hands
Yet without him her life would trail on lifeless
Brooding she touched the flowers
Have them
he said and he took them out of the jar dripping as they were and went quickly into the kitchen
She waited for him took the flowers and they went out together he talking she feeling dead
She was going from him now
In her misery she leaned against him as they sat on the car
He was unresponsive
Where would he go
What would be the end of him
She could not bear it the vacant feeling where he should be
He was so foolish so wasteful never at peace with himself
And now where would he go
And what did he care that he wasted her
He had no religion it was all for the moments attraction that he cared nothing else nothing deeper
Well she would wait and see how it turned out with him
When he had had enough he would give in and come to her
He shook hands and left her at the door of her cousins house
When he turned away he felt the last hold for him had gone
The town as he sat upon the car stretched away over the bay of railway a level fume of lights
Beyond the town the country little smouldering spots for more townsthe seathe nighton and on
And he had no place in it
Whatever spot he stood on there he stood alone
From his breast from his mouth sprang the endless space and it was there behind him everywhere
The people hurrying along the streets offered no obstruction to the void in which he found himself
They were small shadows whose footsteps and voices could be heard but in each of them the same night the same silence
He got off the car
In the country all was dead still
Little stars shone high up little stars spread far away in the floodwaters a firmament below
Everywhere the vastness and terror of the immense night which is roused and stirred for a brief while by the day but which returns and will remain at last eternal holding everything in its silence and its living gloom
There was no Time only Space
Who could say his mother had lived and did not live
She had been in one place and was in another that was all
And his soul could not leave her wherever she was
Now she was gone abroad into the night and he was with her still
They were together
But yet there was his body his chest that leaned against the stile his hands on the wooden bar
They seemed something
Where was heone tiny upright speck of flesh less than an ear of wheat lost in the field
He could not bear it
On every side the immense dark silence seemed pressing him so tiny a spark into extinction and yet almost nothing he could not be extinct
Night in which everything was lost went reaching out beyond stars and sun
Stars and sun a few bright grains went spinning round for terror and holding each other in embrace there in a darkness that outpassed them all and left them tiny and daunted
So much and himself infinitesimal at the core a nothingness and yet not nothing
Mother
he whisperedmother
She was the only thing that held him up himself amid all this
And she was gone intermingled herself
He wanted her to touch him have him alongside with her
But no he would not give in
Turning sharply he walked towards the citys gold phosphorescence
His fists were shut his mouth set fast
He would not take that direction to the darkness to follow her
He walked towards the faintly humming glowing town quickly
