True it was always happening that one of us would be singled out at any moment freakishly and without regard to his own preferences to wrestle with the inflections of some idiotic language long rightly dead while another from some fancied artistic tendency which always failed to justify itself might be told off without warning to hammer out scales and exercises and to bedew the senseless keys with tears of weariness or of revolt
But in subjects common to either sex and held to be necessary even for him whose ambition soared no higher than to crack a whip in a circusring in geography for instance arithmetic or the weary doings of kings and queenseach would have scorned to excel
And indeed whatever our individual gifts a general dogged determination to shirk and to evade kept us all at much the same dead levela level of ignorance tempered by insubordination
Fortunately there existed a wide range of subjects of healthier tone than those already enumerated in which we were free to choose for ourselves and which we would have scorned to consider education and in these we freely followed each his own particular line often attaining an amount of special knowledge which struck our ignorant elders as simply uncanny
For Edward the uniforms accoutrements colours and mottoes of the regiments composing the British Army had a special glamour
In the matter of facings he was simply faultless among chevrons badges medals and stars he moved familiarly he even knew the names of most of the colonels in command and he would squander sunny hours prone on the lawn heedless of challenge from bird or beast poring over a tattered Army List
My own accomplishment was of another charactertook as it seemed to me a wider and a more untrammelled range
Dragoons might have swaggered in Lincoln green riflemen might have donned sporrans over tartan trews without exciting notice or comment from me
But did you seek precise information as to the fauna of the American continent then you had come to the right shop
Where and why the bison wallowed how beaver were to be trapped and wild turkeys stalked the grizzly and how to handle him and the pretty pressing ways of the constrictorin fine the haunts and the habits of all that burrowed strutted roared or wriggled between the Atlantic and the Pacificall this knowledge I took for my province
By the others my equipment was fully recognized
Supposing a book with a bearhunt in it made its way into the house and the atmosphere was electric with excitement still it was necessary that I should first decide whether the slot had been properly described and properly followed up ere the work could be stamped with full approval
A writer might have won fame throughout the civilized globe for his trappers and his realistic backwoods and all went for nothing
If his pemmican were not properly compounded I damned his achievement and it was heard no more of
Harold was hardly old enough to possess a special subject of his own
He had his instincts indeed and at birdsnesting they almost amounted to prophecy
Where we others only suspected eggs surmised possible eggs hinted doubtfully at eggs in the neighbourhood Harold went straight for the right bush bough or hole as if he carried a diviningrod
But this faculty belonged to the class of mere gifts and was not to be ranked with Edwards lore regarding facings and mine as to the habits of prairiedogs both gained by painful study and extensive travel in those realms of gold the Army List and Ballantyne
Selinas subject quite unaccountably happened to be naval history
There is no laying down rules as to subjects you just possess themor rather they possess youand their genesis or protoplasm is rarely to be tracked down
Selina had never so much as seen the sea but for that matter neither had I ever set foot on the American continent the byways of which I knew so intimately
And just as I if set down without warning in the middle of the Rocky Mountains would have been perfectly at home so Selina if a genie had dropped her suddenly on Portsmouth Hard could have given points to most of its frequenters
From the days of Blake down to the death of Nelson she never condescended further Selina had taken spiritual part in every notable engagement of the British Navy and even in the dark days when she had to pick up skirts and flee chased by an ungallant De Ruyter or Van Tromp she was yet cheerful in the consciousness that ere long she would be gleefully hammering the fleets of the world in the glorious times to follow
When that golden period arrived Selina was busy indeed and while loving best to stand where the splinters were flying the thickest
she was also a careful and critical student of seamanship and of manoeuvre
She knew the order in which the great lineofbattle ships moved into action the vessels they respectively engaged the moment when each let go its anchor and which of them had a spring on its cable while not understanding the phrase she carefully noted the fact and she habitually went into an engagement on the quarterdeck of the gallant ship that reserved its fire the longest
At the time of Selinas weird seizure I was unfortunately away from home on a loathsome visit to an aunt and my account is therefore feebly compounded from hearsay
It was an absence I never ceased to regretscoring it up with a sense of injury against the aunt
There was a splendid uselessness about the whole performance that specially appealed to my artistic sense
That it should have been Selina too who should break out this waySelina who had just become a regular subscriber to the Young Ladies Journal and who allowed herself to be taken out to strange teas with an air of resignation palpably assumedthis was a special joy and served to remind me that much of this dreaded convention that was creeping over us might be after all only veneer
Edward also was absent getting licked into shape at school but to him the loss was nothing
With his stern practical bent he wouldnt have seen any sense in itto recall one of his favourite expressions
To Harold however for whom the gods had always cherished a special tenderness it was granted not only to witness but also priestlike to feed the sacred fire itself
And if at the time he paid the penalty exacted by the sordid unimaginative ones who temporarily rule the roast he must ever after one feels sure have carried inside him some of the white gladness of the acolyte who greatly privileged has been permitted to swing a censer at the sacring of the very Mass
October was mellowing fast and with it the year itself full of tender hints in woodland and hedgerow of a course wellnigh completed
From all sides that still afternoon you caught the quick breathing and sob of the runner nearing the goal
Preoccupied and possessed Selina had strayed down the garden and out into the pasture beyond where on a bit of rising ground that dominated the garden on one side and the downs with the old coachroad on the other she had cast herself down to chew the cud of fancy
There she was presently joined by Harold breathless and very full of his latest grievance
I asked him not to he burst out
I said if hed only please wait a bit and Edward would be back soon and it couldnt matter to HIM and the pig wouldnt mind and Edwardd be pleased and everybodyd be happy
But he just said he was very sorry but bacon didnt wait for nobody
So I told him he was a regular beast and then I came away
Andand I blieve theyre doing it now
Yes hes a beast agreed Selina absently
She had forgotten all about the pigkilling
Harold kicked away a freshly thrown up molehill and prodded down the hole with a stick
From the direction of Farmer Larkins demesne came a longdrawn note of sorrow a thin cry and appeal telling that the stout soul of a black Berkshire pig was already faring down the stony track to Hades
Dyou know what day it is
said Selina presently in a low voice looking far away before her
Harold did not appear to know nor yet to care
He had laid open his molerun for a yard or so and was still grubbing at it absorbedly
Its Trafalgar Day went on Selina trancedly Trafalgar Day and nobody cares
Something in her tone told Harold that he was not behaving quite becomingly
He didnt exactly know in what manner still he abandoned his molehunt for a more courteous attitude of attention
Over there resumed Selinashe was gazing out in the direction of the old highroadover there the coaches used to go by
Uncle Thomas was telling me about it the other day
And the people used to watch for em coming to tell the time by and praps to get their parcels
And one morningthey wouldnt be expecting anything differentone morning first there would be a cloud of dust as usual and then the coach would come racing by and THEN they would know
For the coach would be dressed in laurel all laurel from stem to stern
And the coachman would be wearing laurel and the guard would be wearing laurel and then they would know then they would know
Harold listened in respectful silence
He would much rather have been hunting the mole who must have been a mile away by this time if he had his wits about him
But he had all the natural instincts of a gentleman of whom it is one of the principal marks if not the complete definition never to show signs of being bored
Selina rose to her feet and paced the turf restlessly with a short quarterdeck walk
Why cant we DO something
she burst out presently
HEhe did everythingwhy cant we do anything for him
WHO did everything
inquired Harold meekly
It was useless wasting further longings on that mole
Like the dead he travelled fast
Why Nelson of course said Selina shortly still looking restlessly around for help or suggestion
But heshes DEAD isnt he
asked Harold slightly puzzled
Whats that got to do with it
retorted his sister resuming her cagedlion promenade
Harold was somewhat taken aback
In the case of the pig for instance whose last outcry had now passed into stillness he had considered the chapter as finally closed
Whatever innocent mirth the holidays might hold in store for Edward that particular pig at least would not be a contributor
And now he was given to understand that the situation had not materially changed
He would have to revise his ideas it seemed
Sitting up on end he looked towards the garden for assistance in the task
Thence even as he gazed a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into the still air
The gardener had been sweeping that afternoon and now an unconscious priest was offering his sacrifice of autumn leaves to the calmeyed goddess of changing hues and chill forebodings who was moving slowly about the land that golden afternoon
Harold was up and off in a moment forgetting Nelson forgetting the pig the mole the Larkin betrayal and Selinas strange fever of conscience
Here was fire real fire to play with and that was even better than messing with water or remodelling the plastic surface of the earth
Of all the toys the world provides for rightminded persons the original elements rank easily the first
But Selina sat on where she was her chin on her fists and her fancies whirled and drifted here and there in curls and eddies along with the smoke she was watching
As the quick footed dusk of the short October day stepped lightly over the garden little red tongues of fire might be seen to leap and vanish in the smoke
Harold anon staggering under armfuls of leaves anon stoking vigorously was discernible only at fitful intervals
It was another sort of smoke that the inner eye of Selina was looking upona smoke that hung in sullen banks round the masts and the hulls of the fighting ships a smoke from beneath which came thunder and the crash and the splinterrip the shout of the boarding party the choking sob of the gunner stretched by his gun a smoke from out of which at last she saw as through a riven pall the radiant spirit of the Victor crowned with the coronal of a perfect death leap in full assurance up into the ether that Immortals breathe
The dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire something of the priestess in her stride something of the devotee in the set purpose of her eye
The leaves were well alight by this time and Harold had just added an old furze bush which flamed and crackled stirringly
Go n get some more sticks ordered Selina and shavings n chunks of wood n anything you can find
Look herein the kitchengarden theres a pile of old peasticks
Fetch as many as you can carry and then go back and bring some more
But I say began Harold amazedly scarce knowing his sister and with a vision of a frenzied gardener peastickless and threatening retribution
Go and fetch em quick 
shouted Selina stamping with impatience
Harold ran off at once true to the stern system of discipline in which he had been nurtured
But his eyes were like round Os and as he ran he talked fast to himself in evident disorder of mind
The peasticks made a rare blaze and the fire no longer smouldering sullenly leapt up and began to assume the appearance of a genuine bonfire
Harold awed into silence at first began to jump round it with shouts of triumph
Selina looked on grimly with knitted brow she was not yet fully satisfied
Cant you get any more sticks
she said presently
Go and hunt about
Get some old hampers and matting and things out of the toolhouse
Smash up that old cucumber frame Edward shoved you into the day we were playing scouts and Mohicans
Stop a bit
Hooray
I know
You come along with me
Hard by there was a hothouse Aunt Elizas special pride and joy and even grimly approved of by the gardener
At one end in an outhouse adjoining the necessary firing was stored and to this sacred fuel of which we were strictly forbidden to touch a stick Selina went straight
Harold followed obediently prepared for any crime after that of the peasticks but pinching himself to see if he were really awake
You bring some coals said Selina briefly without any palaver or proandcon discussion
Heres a basket
ILL manage the faggots
In a very few minutes there was little doubt about its being a genuine bonfire and no paltry makeshift
Selina a Maenad now hatless and tossing disordered locks all the dross of the young lady purged out of her stalked around the pyre of her own purloining or prodded it with a peastick
And as she prodded she murmured at intervals I KNEW there was something we could do
It isnt muchbut still its SOMETHING
The gardener had gone home to his tea
Aunt Eliza had driven out for hers a long way off and was not expected back till quite late and this far end of the garden was not overlooked by any windows
So the Tribute blazed on merrily unchecked
Villagers far away catching sight of the flare muttered something about them young devils at their tricks again and trudged on beer wards
Never a thought of what day it was never a thought for Nelson who preserved their honest pintpots to be paid for in honest pence and saved them from litres and decimal coinage
Nearer at hand frightened rabbits popped up and vanished with a flick of white tails scared birds fluttered among the branches or sped across the glade to quieter sleepingquarters but never a bird nor a beast gave a thought to the hero to whom they owed it that each year their little homes of horsehair wool or moss were safe stablished neath the flap of the British flag and that Game Laws quietly permanent made la chasse a terror only to their betters
No one seemed to know nor to care nor to sympathise
In all the ecstasy of her burnt offering and sacrifice Selina stood alone
And yetnot quite alone
For as the fire was roaring at its best certain stars stepped delicately forth on the surface of the immensity above and peered down doubtfullywith wonder at first then with interest then with recognition with a start of glad surprise
THEY at least knew all about it THEY understood
Among THEM the Name was a daily familiar word his story was a part of the music to which they swung himself was their fellow and their mate and comrade
So they peeped and winked and peeped again and called to their laggard brothers to come quick and see







The best of life is but intoxication and Selina who during her brief inebriation had lived in an ecstasy as golden as our drab existence affords had to experience the inevitable bitterness of awakening sobriety when the dying down of the flames into sullen embers coincided with the frenzied entrance of Aunt Eliza on the scene
It was not so much that she was at once and forever disrated broke sent before the mast and branded as one on whom no reliance could be placed even with Edward safe at school and myself under the distant vigilance of an aunt that her pocket money was stopped indefinitely and her new Church Service the pride of her last birthday removed from her own custody and placed under the control of a Trust
She sorrowed rather because she had dragged poor Harold against his better judgment into a most horrible scrape and moreover because when the reaction had fairly set in when the exaltation had fizzled away and the younglady portion of her had crept timorously back to its wonted lodging she could only see herself as a plain fool unjustified undeniable without a shadow of an excuse or explanation
As for Harold youth and a short memory made his case less pitiful than it seemed to his more sensitive sister
True he started upstairs to his lonely cot bellowing dismally before him a dreary future of pains and penalties sufficient to last to the crack of doom
Outside his door however he tumbled over Augustus the cat and made capture of him and at once his mourning was changed into a song of triumph as he conveyed his prize into port
For Augustus who detested above all things going to bed with little boys was ever more knave than fool and the trapper who was wily enough to ensnare him had achieved something notable
Augustus when he realized that his fate was sealed and his nights lodging settled wisely made the best of things and listened with a languorous air of complete comprehension to the incoherent babble concerning pigs and heroes moles and bonfires which served Harold for a selfsung lullaby
Yet it may be doubted whether Augustus was one of those rare fellows who thoroughly understood
But Selina knew no more of this source of consolation than of the sympathy with which the stars were winking above her and it was only after some sad interval oftime and on a very moist pillow that she drifted into that quaint inconsequent country where you may meet your own pet hero strolling down the road and commit what hairbrained oddities you like and everybody understands and appreciates
DIES IRAE Those memorable days that move in procession their heads just out of the mist of years long deadthe most of them are full eyed as the dandelion that from dawn to shade has steeped itself in sunlight
Here and there in their ranks however moves a forlorn one who is blindblind in the sense of the dulled windowpane on which the pelting raindrops have mingled and run down obscuring sunshine and the circling birds happy fields and storied garden blind with the spatter of a misery uncomprehended unanalysed only felt as something corporeal in its buffeting effects
Martha began it and yet Martha was not really to blame
Indeed that was half the trouble of itno solid person stood full in view to be blamed and to make atonement
There was only a wretched impalpable condition to deal with
Breakfast was just over the sun was summoning us imperious as a herald with clamour of trumpet I ran upstairs to her with a broken bootlace in my hand and there she was crying in a corner her head in her apron
Nothing could be got from her but the same dismal succession of sobs that would not have done that struck and hurt like a physical beating and meanwhile the sun was getting impatient and I wanted my bootlace
Inquiry below stairs revealed the cause
Marthas brother was dead it seemedher sailor brother Billy drowned in one of those strange faroff seas it was our dream to navigate one day
We had known Billy well and appreciated him
When an approaching visit of Billy to his sister had been announced we had counted the days to it
When his cheery voice was at last heard in the kitchen and we had descended with shouts first of all he had to exhibit his tattooed arms always a subject for fresh delight and envy and awe then he was called upon for tricks jugglings and strange fearful gymnastics and lastly came yarns and more yarns and yarns till bedtime
There had never been any one like Billy in his own particular sphere and now he was drowned they said and Martha was miserable andand I couldnt get a new bootlace
They told me that Billy would never come back any more and I stared out of the window at the sun which came back right enough every day and their news conveyed nothing whatever to me
Marthas sorrow hit home a little but only because the actual sight and sound of it gave me a dull bad sort of pain low down insidea pain not to be actually located
Moreover I was still wanting my bootlace
This was a poor sort of a beginning to a day that so far as outside conditions went had promised so well
I rigged up a sort of jurymast of a bootlace with a bit of old string and wandered off to look up the girls conscious of a jar and a discordance in the scheme of things
The moment I entered the schoolroom something in the air seemed to tell me that here too matters were strained and awry
Selina was staring listlessly out of the window one foot curled round her leg
When I spoke to her she jerked a shoulder testily but did not condescend to the civility of a reply
Charlotte absolutely unoccupied sprawled in a chair and there were signs of sniffles about her even at that early hour
It was but a trifling matter that had caused all this electricity in the atmosphere and the girls manner of taking it seemed to me most unreasonable
Within the last few days the time had come round for the despatch of a hamper to Edward at school
Only one hamper a term was permitted him so its preparation was a sort of blend of revelry and religious ceremony
After the main corpus of the thing had been carefully selected and safely bestowedthe pots of jam the cake the sausages and the apples that filled up corners so nicelyafter the last package had been wedged in the girls had deposited their own private and personal offerings on the top
I forget their precise nature anyhow they were nothing of any particular practical use to a boy
But they had involved some contrivance and labour some skimping of pocket money and much delightful cloudbuilding as to the effect on their enraptured recipient
Well yesterday there had come a terse acknowledgment from Edward heartily commending the cakes and the jam stamping the sausages with the seal of Smith majors approval and finally hinting that fortified as he now was nothing more was necessary but a remittance of five shillings in postage stamps to enable him to face the world armed against every buffet of fate
That was all
Never a word or a hint of the personal tributes or of his appreciation of them
To usto Harold and me that isthe letter seemed natural and sensible enough
After all provender was the main thing and five shillings stood for a complete equipment against the most unexpected turns of luck
The presents were very well in their wayvery nice and so onbut life was a serious matter and the contest called for cakes and half crowns to carry it on not gew gaws and knitted mittens and the like
The girls however in their obstinate way persisted in taking their own view of the slight
Hence it was that I received my second rebuff of the morning
Somewhat disheartened I made my way downstairs and out into the sunlight where I found Harold playing conspirators by himself on the gravel
He had dug a small hole in the walk and had laid an imaginary train of powder thereto and as he sought refuge in the laurels from the inevitable explosion I heard him murmur My God
said the Czar my plans are frustrated
It seemed an excellent occasion for being a black puma
Harold liked black pumas on the whole as well as any animal we were familiar with
So I launched myself on him with the appropriate howl rolling him over on the gravel
Life may be said to be composed of things that come off and things that dont come off
This thing unfortunately was one of the things that didnt come off
From beneath me I heard a shrill cry of Oh its my sore knee
And Harold wriggled himself free from the pumas clutches bellowing dismally
Now I honestly didnt know he had a sore knee and whats more he knew I didnt know he had a sore knee
According to boy ethics therefore his attitude was wrong sore knee or not and no apology was due from me
I made halfway advances however suggesting we should lie in ambush by the edge of the pond and cut off the ducks as they waddled down in simple unsuspecting single file then hunt them as bisons flying scattered over the vast prairie
A fascinating pursuit this and strictly illicit
But Harold would none of my overtures and retreated to the house wailing with full lungs
Things were getting simply infernal
I struck out blindly for the open country and even as I made for the gate a shrill voice from a window bade me keep off the flowerbeds
When the gate had swung to behind me with a vicious click I felt better and after ten minutes along the road it began to grow on me that some radical change was needed that I was in a blind alley and that this intolerable state of things must somehow cease
All that I could do I had already done
As wellmeaning a fellow as ever stepped was pounding along the road that day with an exceeding sore heart one who only wished to live and let live in touch with his fellows and appreciating what joys life had to offer
What was wanted now was a complete change of environment
Some where in the world I felt sure justice and sympathy still resided
There were places called pampas for instance that sounded well
League upon league of grass with just an occasional wild horse and not a relation within the horizon
To a bruised spirit this seemed a sane and a healing sort of existence
There were other pleasant corners again where you dived for pearls and stabbed sharks in the stomach with your big knife
No relations would be likely to come interfering with you when thus blissfully occupied
And yet I did not wishjust yetto have done with relations entirely
They should be made to feel their position first to see themselves as they really were and to wishwhen it was too latethat they had behaved more properly
Of all professions the army seemed to lend itself the most thoroughly to the scheme
You enlisted you followed the drum you marched fought and ported arms under strange skies through unrecorded years
At last at long last your opportunity would come when the horrors of war were flickering through the quiet countryside where you were cradled and bred but where the memory of you had long been dim
Folk would run together clamorous palsied with fear and among the terrorstricken groups would figure certain aunts
What hope is left us
they would ask themselves save in the clemency of the General the mysterious invincible General of whom men tell such romantic tales
And the army would march in and the guns would rattle and leap along the village street and last of all youyou the General the fabled heroyou would enter on your coalblack charger your pale set face seamed by an interesting sabrecut
And thenbut every boy has rehearsed this familiar piece a score of times
You are magnanimous in finethat goes without saying you have a coalblack horse and a sabrecut and you can afford to be very magnanimous
But all the same you give them a good talkingto
This pleasant conceit simply ravished my soul for some twenty minutes and then the old sense of injury began to well up afresh and to call for new plasters and soothing syrups
This time I took refuge in happy thoughts of the sea
The sea was my real sphere after all
On the sea in especial you could combine distinction with lawlessness whereas the army seemed to be always weighted by a certain plodding submission to discipline
To be sure by all accounts the life was at first a rough one
But just then I wanted to suffer keenly I wanted to be a poor devil of a cabin boy kicked beaten and sworn atfor a time
Perhaps some hint some inkling of my sufferings might reach their ears
In due course the sloop or felucca would turn upit always didthe rakishlooking craft black of hull low in the water and bristling with guns the jolly Roger flapping overhead and myself for sole commander
By and by as usually happened an East Indiaman would come sailing along full of relationsnot a necessary relation would be missing
And the crew should walk the plank and the captain should dance from his own yardarm and then I would take the passengers in handthat miserable group of wellknown figures cowering on the quarter deckand thenand then the same old performance the air thick with magnanimity
In all the repertory of heroes none is more truly magnanimous than your pirate chief
When at last I brought myself back from the future to the actual present I found that these delectable visions had helped me over a longer stretch of road than I had imagined and I looked around and took my bearings
To the right of me was a long low building of grey stone new and yet not smugly so new and yet possessing distinction marked with a character that did not depend on lichen or on crumbling semieffacement of moulding and mullion
Strangers might have been puzzled to classify it to me an explorer from earliest years the place was familiar enough
Most folk called it The Settlement others with quite sufficient conciseness for our neighbourhood spoke of them there fellows up by Hallidays others again with a hint of derision named them the monks
This last title I supposed to be intended for satire and knew to be fatuously wrong
I was thoroughly acquainted with monksin booksand well knew the cut of their long frocks their shaven polls and their fascinating big dogs with brandybottles round their necks incessantly hauling happy travellers out of the snow
The only dog at the settlement was an Irish terrier and the good fellows who owned him and were owned by him in common wore clothes of the most nondescript order and mostly cultivated sidewhiskers
I had wandered up there one day searching as usual for something I never found and had been taken in by them and treated as friend and comrade
They had made me free of their ideal little rooms full of books and pictures and clean of the antimacassar taint they had shown me their chapel high hushed and faintly scented beautiful with a strange new beauty born both of what it had and what it had notthat too familiar dowdiness of common places of worship
They had also fed me in their dininghall where a long table stood on trestles plain to view and all the woodwork was natural unpainted healthily scrubbed and redolent of the forest it came from
I brought away from that visit and kept by me for many days a sense of cleanness of the freshness that pricks the sensesthe freshness of cool spring water and the large swept spaces of the rooms the red tiles and the oaken settles suggested a comfort that had no connexion with padded upholstery
On this particular morning I was in much too unsociable a mind for paying friendly calls
Still something in the aspect of the place harmonised with my humour and I worked my way round to the back where the ground after affording level enough for a kitchengarden broke steeply away
Both the word Gothic and the thing itself were still unknown to me yet doubtless the architecture of the place consistent throughout accounted for its sense of comradeship in my hour of disheartenment
As I mused there with the low grey purposefullooking building before me and thought of my pleasant friends within and what good times they always seemed to be having and how they larked with the Irish terrier whose footing was one of a perfect equality I thought of a certain look in their faces as if they had a common purpose and a business and were acting under orders thoroughly recognised and understood
I remembered too something that Martha had told me about these same fellows doing a power o good and other hints I had collected vaguely of renouncements rules selfdenials and the like
Thereupon out of the depths of my morbid soul swam up a new and fascinating idea and at once the career of arms seemed overacted and stale and piracy as a profession flat and unprofitable
This then or something like it should be my vocation and my revenge
A severer line of business perhaps such as I had read of something that included black bread and a hairshirt
There should be vows tooirrevocable blood curdling vows and an iron grating
This iron grating was the most necessary feature of all for I intended that on the other side of it my relations should range themselvesI mentally ran over the catalogue and saw that the whole gang was present all in their proper places a sadeyed row combined in tristful appeal
We see our error now they would say we were always dull dogs slow to catch especially in those akin to usthe finer qualities of soul
We misunderstood you misappreciated you and we own up to it
And now Alas my dear friends I would strike in here waving towards them an ascetic handone of the emaciated sort that lets the light shine through at the fingertipsAlas you come too late
This conduct is fitting and meritorious on your part and indeed I always expected it of you sooner or later but the die is cast and you may go home again and bewail at your leisure this too tardy repentance of yours
For me I am vowed and dedicated and my relations henceforth are austerity and holy works
Once a month should you wish it it shall be your privilege to come and gaze at me through this very solid grating but WHACK
A wellaimed clod of garden soil whizzing just past my ear starred on a treetrunk behind spattering me with dirt
The present came back to me in a flash and I nimbly took cover behind the trees realising that the enemy was up and abroad with ambuscades alarms and thrilling sallies
It was the gardeners boy I knew well enough a red proletariat who hated me just because I was a gentleman
Hastily picking up a nice sticky clod in one hand with the other I delicately projected my hat beyond the shelter of the treetrunk
I had not fought with Redskins all these years for nothing
As I had expected another clod of the first class for size and stickiness took my poor hat full in the centre
Then Ajax like shouting terribly I issued from shelter and discharged my ammunition
Woe then for the gardeners boy who unprepared skipping in premature triumph took the clod full in his stomach
He the foolish one witless on whose side the gods were fighting that day discharged yet other missiles wavering and wide of the mark for his wind had been taken with the first clod and he shot wildly as one already desperate and in flight
I got another clod in at short range we clinched on the brow of the hill and rolled down to the bottom together
When he had shaken himself free and regained his legs he trotted smartly off in the direction of his mothers cottage but over his shoulder he discharged at me both imprecation and deprecation menace mixed up with an undercurrent of tears
But as for me I made off smartly for the road my frame tingling my head high with never a backward look at the Settlement of suggestive aspect or at my wellplanned future which lay in fragments around it
Life had its jollities then life was action contest victory
The present was rosy once more surprises lurked on every side and I was beginning to feel villainously hungry
Just as I gained the road a cart came rattling by and I rushed for it caught the chain that hung below and swung thrillingly between the dizzy wheels choked and blinded with delicious smelling dust the world slipping by me like a streaky ribbon below till the driver licked at me with his whip and I had to descend to earth again
Abandoning the beaten track I then struck homewards through the fields not that the way was very much shorter but rather because on that route one avoided the bridge and had to splash through the stream and get refreshingly wet
Bridges were made for narrow folk for people with aims and vocations which compelled abandonment of many of lifes highest pleasures
Truly wise men called on each element alike to minister to their joy and while the touch of sunbathed air the fragrance of garden soil the ductible qualities of mud and the sparkwhirling rapture of playing with fire had each their special charm they did not overlook the bliss of getting their feet wet
As I came forth on the common Harold broke out of an adjoining copse and ran to meet me the morning rainclouds all blown away from his face
He had made a new squirrelstick it seemed
Made it all himself melted the lead and everything
I examined the instrument critically and pronounced it absolutely magnificent
As we passed in at our gate the girls were distantly visible gardening with a zeal in cheerful contrast to their heartsick lassitude of the morning
Theres bin another letter come today Harold explained and the hamper got joggled about on the journey and the presents worked down into the straw and all over the place
One of em turned up inside the cold duck
And thats why they werent found at first
And Edward said Thanks AWFULLY I did not see Martha again until we were all reassembled at tea time when she seemed redeyed and strangely silent neither scolding nor finding fault with anything
Instead she was very kind and thoughtful with jams and things feverishly pressing unwonted delicacies on us who wanted little pressing enough
Then suddenly when I was busiest she disappeared and Charlotte whispered me presently that she had heard her go to her room and lock herself in
This struck me as a funny sort of proceeding
MUTABILE SEMPER She stood on the other side of the garden fence and regarded me gravely as I came down the road
Then she said Hio
and I responded Hullo
and pulled up somewhat nervously
To tell the truth the encounter was not entirely unexpected on my part
The previous Sunday I had seen her in church and after service it had transpired who she was this newcomer and what aunt she was staying with
That morning a volunteer had been called for to take a note to the Parsonage and rather to my own surprise I had found myself stepping forward with alacrity while the others had become suddenly absorbed in various pursuits or had sneaked unobtrusively out of view
Certainly I had not yet formed any deliberate plan of action yet I suppose I recollected that the road to the Parsonage led past her aunts garden
She began the conversation while I hopped backwards and forwards over the ditch feigning a careless ease
Saw you in church on Sunday she said only you looked different then
All dressed up and your hair quite smooth and brushed up at the sides and oh so shiny
What do they put on it to make it shine like that
Dont you hate having your hair brushed
she ran on without waiting for an answer
How your boots squeaked when you came down the aisle
When mine squeak I walk in all the puddles till they stop
Think Ill get over the fence
This she proceeded to do in a businesslike way while with my hands deep in my pockets I regarded her movements with silent interest as those of some strange new animal
Ive been gardening she explained when she had joined me but I didnt like it
Theres so many worms about today
I hate worms
Wish theyd keep out of the way when Im digging
Oh I like worms when Im digging I replied heartily seem to make things more lively dont they
She reflected
Shouldnt mind em so much if they were warm and DRY she said but here she shivered and somehow I liked her for it though if it had been my own flesh and blood hoots of derision would have instantly assailed her
From worms we passed naturally enough to frogs and thence to pigs aunts gardeners rockinghorses and other fellowcitizens of our common kingdom
In five minutes we had each others confidences and I seemed to have known her for a lifetime
Somehow on the subject of ones self it was easier to be frank and communicative with her than with ones female kin
It must be I supposed because she was less familiar with ones faulty tattered past
I was watching you as you came along the road she said presently and you had your head down and your hands in your pockets and you werent throwing stones at anything or whistling or jumping over things and I thought perhaps youd bin scolded or got a stomachache
No I answered shyly it wasnt that
Fact is I wasI oftenbut its a secret
There I made an error in tactics
That enkindling word set her dancing round me half beseeching half imperious
Oh do tell it me
she cried
You must
Ill never tell anyone else at all I vow and declare I wont
Her small frame wriggled with emotion and with imploring eyes she jigged impatiently just in front of me
Her hair was tumbled bewitchingly on her shoulders and even the loss of a front tootha loss incidental to her ageseemed but to add a piquancy to her face
You wont care to hear about it I said wavering
Besides I cant explain exactly
I think I wont tell you
But all the time I knew I should have to
But I DO care she wailed plaintively
I didnt think youd be so unkind
This would never do
That little downward tug at either corner of the mouthI knew the symptom only too well
Its like this I began stammeringly
This bit of road here up as far as that corneryou know its a horrid dull bit of road
Im always having to go up and down it and I know it so well and Im so sick of it
So whenever I get to that corner I justwell I go right off to another place
What sort of a place
she asked looking round her gravely
Of course its just a place I imagine I went on hurriedly and rather shamefacedly but its an awfully nice placethe nicest place you ever saw
And I always go off there in church or during joggraphy lessons
Im sure its not nicer than my home she cried patriotically
Oh you ought to see my homeits lovely
Weve got Yes it is ever so much nicer I interrupted
I meanI went on apologeticallyof course I know your homes beautiful and all that
But this MUST be nicer cos if you want anything at all youve only GOT to want it and you can have it
That sounds jolly she murmured
Tell me more about it please
Tell me how you get there first
Idontquiteknowexactly I replied
I just go
But generally it begins bywell youre going up a broad clear river in a sort of a boat
Youre not rowing or anythingyoure just moving along
And theres beautiful grass meadows on both sides and the rivers very full quite up to the level of the grass
And you glide along by the edge
And the people are haymaking there and playing games and walking about and they shout to you and you shout back to them and they bring you things to eat out of their baskets and let you drink out of their bottles and some of em are the nice people you read about in books
And so at last you come to the Palace stepsgreat broad marble steps reaching right down to the water
And there at the steps you find every sort of boat you can imagine schooners and punts and rowboats and little menofwar
And you have any sort of boating you want torowing or sailing or shoving about in a punt
Id go sailing she said decidedly and Id steer
No YOUD have to steer and Id sit about on the deck
No I wouldnt though Id rowat least Id make you row and Id steer
And then wedOh no
Ill tell you what wed do
Wed just sit in a punt and dabble
Of course well do just what you like I said hospitably but already I was beginning to feel my liberty of action somewhat curtailed by this exigent visitor I had so rashly admitted into my sanctum
I dont think wed boat at all she finally decided
Its always so WOBBLY
Where do you come to next
You go up the steps I continued and in at the door and the very first place you come to is the Chocolateroom
She brightened up at this and I heard her murmur with gusto Chocolateroom
Its got every sort of chocolate you can think of I went on soft chocolate with sticky stuff inside white and pink what girls like and hard shiny chocolate that cracks when you bite it and takes such a nice long time to suck
I like the soft stuff best she said cos you can eat such a lot more of it
This was to me a new aspect of the chocolate question and I regarded her with interest and some respect
With us chocolate was none too common a thing and whenever we happened to come by any we resorted to the quaintest devices in order to make it last out
Still legends had reached us of children who actually had from time to time as much chocolate as they could possibly eat and here apparently was one of them
You can have all the creams I said magnanimously and Ill eat the hard sticks cos I like em best
Oh but you mustnt
she cried impetuously
You must eat the same as I do
It isnt nice to want to eat different
Ill tell you whatyou must give ME all the chocolate and then Ill give YOUIll give you what you ought to have
Oh all right I said in a subdued sort of way
It seemed a little hard to be put under a sentimental restriction like this in ones own Chocolateroom
In the next room you come to I proceeded theres fizzy drinks
Theres a marbleslab business all round the room and little silver taps and you just turn the right tap and have any kind of fizzy drink you want
What fizzy drinks are there
she inquired
Oh all sorts I answered hastily hurrying on
She might restrict my eatables but Id be hanged if I was going to have her meddle with my drinks
Then you go down the corridor and at the back of the palace theres a great big parkthe finest park you ever saw
And theres ponies to ride on and carriages and carts and a little railway all complete engine and guards van and all and you work it yourself and you can go first class or in the van or on the engine just whichever you choose
Id go on the engine she murmured dreamily
No I wouldnt Id Then theres all the soldiers I struck in
Really the line had to be drawn somewhere and I could not have my railway system disorganised and turned upside down by a mere girl
Theres any quantity of em fine big soldiers and they all belong to me
And a row of brass cannons all along the terrace
And every now and then I give the order and they fire off all the guns
No they dont she interrupted hastily
I wont have em fire off any guns
You must tell em not to
I hate guns and as soon as they begin firing I shall run right away
Butbut thats what theyre THERE for I protested aghast
I dont care she insisted
They mustnt do it
They can walk about behind me if they like and talk to me and carry things
But they mustnt fire off any guns
I was sadly conscious by this time that in this brave palace of mine wherein I was wont to swagger daily irresponsible and unquestioned I was rapidly becomingso to speaka mere lodger
The idea of my fine big soldiers being told off to carry things
I was not inclined to tell her any more though there still remained plenty more to tell
Any other boys there
she asked presently in a casual sort of way
Oh yes I unguardedly replied
Nice chaps too
Well have great Then I recollected myself
Well play with them of course I went on
But you are going to be MY friend arent you
And youll come in my boat and well travel in the guards van together and Ill stop the soldiers firing off their guns
But she looked mischievously away anddo what I wouldI could not get her to promise
Just then the striking of the village clock awoke within me another clamorous timepiece reminding me of midday mutton a good halfmile away and of penalties and curtailments attaching to a late appearance
We took a hurried farewell of each other and before we parted I got from her an admission that she might be gardening again that afternoon if only the worms would be less aggressive and give her a chance
Remember I said as I turned to go you mustnt tell anybody about what Ive been telling you
She appeared to hesitate swinging one leg to and fro while she regarded me sideways with halfshut eyes
Its a dead secret I said artfully
A secret between us two and nobody knows it except ourselves
Then she promised nodding violently bigeyed her mouth pursed up small
The delight of revelation and the bliss of possessing a secret run each other very close
But the latter generally winsfor a time
I had passed the mutton stage and was weltering in warm rice pudding before I found leisure to pause and take in things generally and then a glance in the direction of the window told me to my dismay that it was raining hard
This was annoying in every way for even if it cleared up later the wormsI knew well from experiencewould be offensively numerous and frisky
Sulkily I said grace and accompanied the others upstairs to the schoolroom where I got out my paintbox and resolved to devote myself seriously to Art which of late I had much neglected
Harold got hold of a sheet of paper and a pencil retired to a table in the corner squared his elbows and protruded his tongue
Literature had always been HIS form of artistic expression
Selina had a fit of the fidgets bred of the unpromising weather and instead of settling down to something on her own account must needs walk round and annoy us artists intent on embodying our conceptions of the ideal
She had been looking over my shoulder some minutes before I knew of it or I would have had a word or two to say upon the subject
I suppose you call that thing a ship she remarked contemptuously
Who ever heard of a pink ship
Hoohoo
I stifled my wrath knowing that in order to score properly it was necessary to keep a cool head
There is a pink ship I observed with forced calmness lying in the toyshop window now
You can go and look at it if you like
Dyou suppose you know more about ships than the fellows who make em
Selina baffled for the moment returned to the charge presently
Those are funny things too she observed
Spose theyre meant to be trees
But theyre BLUE
They ARE trees I replied with severity and they ARE blue
Theyve got to be blue cos you stole my gamboge last week so I cant mix up any green
DIDNT steal your gamboge declared Selina haughtily edging away however in the direction of Harold
And I wouldnt tell lies either if I was you about a dirty little bit of gamboge
I preserved a discreet silence
After all I knew SHE knew she stole my gamboge
The moment Harold became conscious of Selinas stealthy approach he dropped his pencil and flung himself flat upon the table protecting thus his literary efforts from chilling criticism by the interposed thickness of his person
From somewhere in his interior proceeded a heart rending compound of squeal and whistle as of escaping steamlongdrawn ear piercing unvarying in note
I only just want to see protested Selina struggling to uproot his small body from the scrawl it guarded
But Harold clung limpetlike to the table edge and his shrill protest continued to deafen humanity and to threaten even the serenities of Olympus
The time seemed come for a demonstration in force
Personally I cared little what souloutpourings of Harold were pirated by Selinashe was pretty sure to get hold of them sooner or laterand indeed I rather welcomed the diversion as favourable to the undisturbed pursuit of Art
But the clannishness of sex has its unwritten laws
Boys as such are sufficiently put upon maltreated trodden under as it is
Should they fail to hang together in perilous times what disasters what ignominies may not be looked for
Possibly even an extinction of the tribe
I dropped my paint brush and sailed shouting into the fray
The result for a short space hung dubious
There is a period of life when the difference of a year or two in age far outweighs the minor advantage of sex
Then the gathers of Selinas frock came away with a sound like the rattle of distant musketry and this calamity it was rather than mere brute compulsion that quelled her indomitable spirit
The female tongue is mightier than the sword as I soon had good reason to know when Selina her riven garment held out at length avenged her discomfiture with the Greekfire of personalities and abuse
Every black incident in my short but not stainless careerevery error every folly every penalty ignobly sufferedwere paraded before me as in a magic lantern show
The information however was not particularly new to me and the effect was staled by previous rehearsals
Besides a victory remains a victory whatever the moral character of the triumphant general
Harold chuckled and crowed as he dropped from the table revealing the document over which so many gathers had sighed their short lives out
YOU can read it if you like he said to me gratefully
Its only a Deathletter
It had never been possible to say what Harolds particular amusement of the hour might turn out to be
One thing only was certain that it would be something improbable unguessable not to be foretold
Who for instance in search of relaxation would ever dream of choosing the drawingup of a testamentary disposition of property
Yet this was the form taken by Harolds latest craze and in justice this much had to be said for him that in the christening of his amusement he had gone right to the heart of the matter
The words will and testament have various meanings and uses but about the signification of deathletter there can be no manner of doubt
I smoothed out the crumpled paper and read
In actual form it deviated considerably from that usually adopted by family solicitors of standing the only resemblance indeed lying in the absence of punctuation
my dear edward it ran when I die I leave all my muny to you my walkin sticks wips my crop my sord and gun bricks forts and all things i have goodbye my dear charlotte when i die I leave you my wach and cumpus and pencel case my salors and camperdown my picteres and evthing goodbye your loving brother armen my dear Martha I love you very much i leave you my garden my mice and rabets my plants in pots when I die please take care of them my dear Coetera desunt
Why youre not leaving me anything
exclaimed Selina indignantly
Youre a regular mean little boy and Ill take back the last birthday present I gave you
I dont care said Harold repossessing himself of the document
I was going to leave you something but I shant now cos you tried to read my deathletter before I was dead
Then Ill write a deathletter myself retorted Selina scenting an artistic vengeance and I shant leave you a single thing
And she went off in search of a pencil
The tempest withindoors had kept my attention off the condition of things without
But now a glance through the window told me that the rain had entirely ceased and that everything was bathed instead in a radiant glow of sunlight more golden than any gamboge of mine could possibly depict
Leaving Selina and Harold to settle their feud by a mutual disinheritance I slipped from the room and escaped into the open air eager to pick up the loose end of my new friendship just where I had dropped it that morning
In the glorious reaction of the sunshine after the downpour with its moist warm smells bespanglement of greenery and inspiriting touch of rainwashed air the parks and palaces of the imagination glowed with a livelier iris and their blurred beauties shone out again with fresh blush and palpitation
As I sped along to the tryst again I accompanied my new comrade along the corridors of my pet palace into which I had so hastily introduced her and on reflection I began to see that it wouldnt work properly
I had made a mistake and those were not the surroundings in which she was most fitted to shine
However it really did not matter much I had other palaces to place at her disposalplenty of em and on a further acquaintance with and knowledge of her tastes no doubt I could find something to suit her
There was a real Arabian one for instance which I visited but rarelyonly just when I was in the fine Oriental mood for it a wonder of silk hangings fountains of rosewater pavilions and minarets
Hundreds of silent welltrained slaves thronged the stairs and alleys of this establishment ready to fetch and carry for her all day if she wished it and my brave soldiers would be spared the indignity
Also there were processions through the bazaar at odd momentsprocessions with camels elephants and palanquins
Yes she was more suited for the East this imperious young person and I determined that thither she should be personally conducted as soon as ever might be
I reached the fence and climbed up two bars of it and leaning over I looked this way and that for my twinsouled partner of the morning
It was not long before I caught sight of her only a short distance away
Her back was towards me andwell one can never foresee exactly how one will find thingsshe was talking to a Boy
Of course there are boys and boys and Lord knows I was never narrow
But this was the parsons son from an adjoining village a redheaded boy and as common a little beast as ever stepped
He cultivated ferretshis only good point and it was evidently through the medium of this art that he was basely supplanting me for her head was bent absorbedly over something he carried in his hands
With some trepidation I called out Hi
But answer there was none
Then again I called Hi
but this time with a sickening sense of failure and of doom
She replied only by a complex gesture decisive in import if not easily described
A petulant toss of the head a jerk of the left shoulder and a backward kick of the left foot all delivered at oncethat was all and that was enough
The redheaded boy never even condescended to glance my way
Why indeed should he
I dropped from the fence without another effort and took my way homewards along the weary road
Little inclination was left to me at first for any solitary visit to my accustomed palace the pleasures of which I had so recently tasted in company and yet after a minute or two I found myself from habit sneaking off there much as usual
Presently I became aware of a certain solace and consolation in my newlyrecovered independence of action
Quit of all female whims and fanciful restrictions I rowed sailed or punted just as I pleased in the Chocolateroom I cracked and nibbled the hard sticks with a certain contempt for those who preferred the soft veneered article and I mixed and quaffed countless fizzy drinks without dread of any prohibitionist
Finally I swaggered into the park paraded all my soldiers on the terrace and bidding them take the time from me gave the order to fire off all the guns
THE MAGIC RING Grownup people really ought to be more careful
Among themselves it may seem but a small thing to give their word and take back their word
For them there are so many compensations
Life lies at their feet a partycoloured indiarubber ball they may kick it this way or kick it that it turns up blue yellow or green but always coloured and glistening
Thus one sees it happen almost every day and with a jest and a laugh the thing is over and the disappointed one turns to fresh pleasure lying ready to his hand
But with those who are below them whose little globe is swayed by them who rush to build starpointing alhambras on their most casual word they really ought to be more careful
In this case of the circus for instance it was not as if we had led up to the subject
It was they who began it entirely prompted thereto by the local newspaper
What a circus
said they in their irritating casual way that would be nice to take the children to
Wednesday would be a good day
Suppose we go on Wednesday
Oh and pleats are being worn again with rows of deep braid etc
What the others thought I know not what they said if they said anything I did not comprehend
For me the house was bursting walls seemed to cramp and to stifle the roof was jumping and lifting
Escape was the imperative thingto escape into the open air to shake off bricks and mortar and to wander in the unfrequented places of the earth the more properly to take in the passion and the promise of the giddy situation
Nature seemed prim and staid that day and the globe gave no hint that it was flying round a circus ring of its own
Could they really be true I wondered all those bewildering things I had heard tell of circuses
Did longtailed ponies really walk on their hindlegs and fire off pistols
Was it humanly possible for clowns to perform onehalf of the bewitching drolleries recorded in history
And how oh how dare I venture to believe that from off the backs of creamy Arab steeds ladies of more than earthly beauty discharged themselves through paper hoops
No it was not altogether possible there must have been some exaggeration
Still I would be content with very little I would take a low percentagea very small proportion of the circus myth would more than satisfy me
But again even supposing that history were once in a way no liar could it be that I myself was really fated to look upon this thing in the flesh and to live through it to survive the rapture
No it was altogether too much
Something was bound to happen one of us would develop measles the world would blow up with a loud explosion
I must not dare I must not presume to entertain the smallest hope
I must endeavour sternly to think of something else
Needless to say I thought I dreamed of nothing else day or night
Waking I walked arminarm with a clown and cracked a portentous whip to the brave music of a band
Sleeping I pursuedperched astride of a coalblack horsea princess all gauze and spangles who always managed to keep just one unattainable length ahead
In the early morning Harold and I once fully awake crossexamined each other as to the possibilities of this or that circus tradition and exhausted the lore long ere the first housemaid was stirring
In this state of exaltation we slipped onward to what promised to be a day of all white dayswhich brings me right back to my text that grownup people really ought to be more careful
I had known it could never really be I had said so to myself a dozen times
The vision was too sweetly ethereal for embodiment
Yet the pang of the disillusionment was none the less keen and sickening and the pain was as that of a corporeal wound
It seemed strange and foreboding when we entered the breakfast room not to find everybody cracking whips jumping over chairs and whooping
In ecstatic rehearsal of the wild reality to come
The situation became grim and pallid indeed when I caught the expressions gardenparty and my mauve tulle and realized that they both referred to that very afternoon
And every minute as I sat silent and listened my heart sank lower and lower descending relentlessly like a clockweight into my boot soles
Throughout my agony I never dreamed of resorting to a direct question much less a reproach
Even during the period of joyful anticipation some fear of breaking the spell had kept me from any bald circus talk in the presence of them
But Harold who was built in quite another way so soon as he discerned the drift of their conversation and heard the knell of all his hopes filled the room with wail and clamour of bereavement
The grinning welkin rang with Circus
Circus
shook the windowpanes the mocking walls reechoed Circus
Circus he would have and the whole circus and nothing but the circus
No compromise for him no evasions no fallacious unsecured promises to pay
He had drawn his cheque on the Bank of Expectation and it had got to be cashed then and there else he would yell and yell himself into a fit and come out of it and yell again
Yelling should be his profession his art his mission his career
He was qualified he was resolute and he was in no hurry to retire from the business
The noisy ones of the world if they do not always shout themselves into the imperial purple are sure at least of receiving attention
If they cannot sell everything at their own price one thingsilencemust at any cost be purchased of them
Harold accordingly had to be consoled by the employment of every specious fallacy and baseborn trick known to those whose doom it is to handle children
For me their hollow cajolery had no interest I could pluck no consolation out of their bankrupt though prodigal pledges I only waited till that hateful wellknown Some other time dear
told me that hope was finally dead
Then I left the room without any remark
It made it worseif anything couldto hear that stale wornout old phrase still supposed by those dullards to have some efficacy
To nature as usual I drifted by instinct and there out of the track of humanity under a friendly hedgerow had my black hour unseen
The world was a globe no longer space was no more filled with whirling circuses of spheres
That day the old beliefs rose up and asserted themselves and the earth was flat againditchriddled stagnant and deadly flat
The undeviating roads crawled straight and white elms dressed themselves stiffly along inflexible hedges all nature centrifugal no longer sprawled flatly in lines out to its farthest edge and I felt just like walking out to that terminus and dropping quietly off
Then as I sat there morosely chewing bits of stick the recollection came back to me of certain fascinating advertisements I had spelled out in the papersadvertisements of great and happy men owning big ships of tonnage running into four figures who yet craved to the extent of public supplication for the sympathetic cooperation of youths as apprentices
I did not rightly know what apprentices might be nor whether I was yet big enough to be styled a youth but one thing seemed clear that by some such means as this whatever the intervening hardships I could eventually visit all the circuses of the worldthe circuses of merry France and gaudy Spain of Holland and Bohemia of China and Peru
Here was a plan worth thinking out in all its bearings for something had presently to be done to end this intolerable state of things
Midday and even feedingtime passed by gloomily enough till a small disturbance occurred which had the effect of releasing some of the electricity with which the air was charged
Harold it should be explained was of a very different mental mould and never brooded moped nor ate his heart out over any disappointment
One wild outburstone dissolution of a minute into his original elements of air and water of tears and outcryso much insulted nature claimed
Then he would pull himself together iron out his countenance with a smile and adjust himself to the new condition of things
If the gods are ever grateful to man for anything it is when he is so good as to display a short memory
The Olympians were never slow to recognize this quality of Harolds in which indeed their salvation lay and on this occasion their gratitude had taken the practical form of a fine fat orange tough rinded as oranges of those days were wont to be
This he had eviscerated in the good oldfashioned manner by biting out a hole in the shoulder inserting a lump of sugar therein and then working it cannily till the whole soul and body of the orange passed glorified through the sugar into his being
Thereupon filled full of orangejuice and iniquity he conceived a deadly snare
Having deftly patted and squeezed the orangeskin till it resumed its original shape he filled it up with water inserted a fresh lump of sugar in the orifice and issuing forth blandly proffered it to me as I sat moodily in the doorway dreaming of strange wild circuses under tropic skies
Such a stale old dodge as this would hardly have taken me in at ordinary moments
But Harold had reckoned rightly upon the disturbing effect of illhumour and had guessed perhaps that I thirsted for comfort and consolation and would not criticise too closely the source from which they came
Unthinkingly I grasped the golden fraud which collapsed at my touch and squirted its contents into my eyes and over my collar till the nethermost parts of me were damp with the water that had run down my neck
In an instant I had Harold down and with all the energy of which I was capable devoted myself to grinding his head into the gravel while he realizing that the closure was applied and that the time for discussion or argument was past sternly concentrated his powers on kicking me in the stomach
Some people can never allow events to work themselves out quietly
At this juncture one of Them swooped down on the scene pouring shrill misplaced abuse on both of us on me for ill treating my younger brother whereas it was distinctly I who was the injured and the deceived on him for the high offence of assault and battery on a clean collara collar which I had myself deflowered and defaced shortly before in sheer desperate illtemper
Disgusted and defiant we fled in different directions rejoining each other later in the kitchengarden and as we strolled along together our short feud forgotten Harold observed gloomily I should like to be a caveman like Uncle George was tellin us about with a flint hatchet and no clothes and live in a cave and not know anybody
And if anyone came to see us we didnt like I joined in catching on to the points of the idea wed hit him on the head with the hatchet till he dropped down dead
And then said Harold warming up wed drag him into the cave and SKIN HIM
For a space we gloated silently over the fair scene our imaginations had conjured up
It was BLOOD we felt the need of just then
We wanted no luxuries nothing dearbought nor farfetched
Just plain blood and nothing else and plenty of it
Blood however was not to be had
The time was out of joint and we had been born too late
So we went off to the greenhouse crawled into the heating arrangement underneath and played at the dark and dirty and unrestricted life of cavemen till we were heartily sick of it
Then we emerged once more into historic times and went off to the road to look for something living and sentient to throw stones at
Nature so often a cheerful ally sometimes sulks and refuses to play
When in this mood she passes the word to her underlings and all the little people of fur and feather take the hint and slip home quietly by back streets
In vain we scouted lurked crept and ambuscaded
Everything that usually scurried hopped or flutteredthe small society of the undergrowthseemed to have engagements elsewhere
The horrid thought that perhaps they had all gone off to the circus occurred to us simultaneously and we humped ourselves up on the fence and felt bad
Even the sound of approaching wheels failed to stir any interest in us
When you are bent on throwing stones at something humanity seems obtrusive and better away
Then suddenly we both jumped off the fence together our faces clearing
For our educated ear had told us that the approaching rattle could only proceed from a dogcart and we felt sure it must be the funny man
We called him the funny man because he was sad and serious and said little but gazed right into our souls and made us tell him just what was on our minds at the time and then came out with some magnificently luminous suggestion that cleared every cloud away
What was more he would then go off with us at once and play the thing right out to its finish earnestly and devotedly putting all other things aside
So we called him the funny man meaning only that he was different from those others who thought it incumbent on them to play the painful mummer
The ideal as opposed to the real man was what we meant only we were not acquainted with the phrase
Those others with their laboured jests and clumsy contortions doubtless flattered themselves that THEY were funny men we who had to sit through and applaud the painful performance knew better
He pulled up to a walk as soon as he caught sight of us and the dogcart crawled slowly along till it stopped just opposite
Then he leant his chin on his hand and regarded us long and soulfully yet said he never a word while we jigged up and down in the dust grinning bashfully but with expectation
For you never knew exactly what this man might say or do
You look bored he remarked presently thoroughly bored
Or elselet me see youre not married are you
He asked this in such sad earnestness that we hastened to assure him we were not married though we felt he ought to have known that much we had been intimate for some time
Then its only boredom he said
Just satiety and world weariness
Well if you assure me you arent married you can climb into this cart and Ill take you for a drive
Im bored too
I want to do something dark and dreadful and exciting
We clambered in of course yapping with delight and treading all over his toes and as we set off Harold demanded of him imperiously whither he was going
My wife he replied has ordered me to go and look up the curate and bring him home to tea
Does that sound sufficiently exciting for you
Our faces fell
The curate of the hour was not a success from our point of view
He was not a funny man in any sense of the word 
but Im not going to he added cheerfully
Then I was to stop at some cottage and askwhat was it
There was NETTLE RASH mixed up in it Im sure
But never mind Ive forgotten and it doesnt matter
Look here were three desperate young fellows who stick at nothing
Suppose we go off to the circus
Of certain supreme moments it is not easy to write
The varying shades and currents of emotion may indeed be put into words by those specially skilled that way they often are at considerable length
But the sheer crude article itselfthe strong live thing that leaps up inside you and swells and strangles you the dizziness of revulsion that takes the breath like cold waterwho shall depict this and live
All I knew was that I would have died then and there cheerfully for the funny man that I longed for red Indians to spring out from the hedge on the dogcart just to show what I would do and that with all this I could not find the least little word to say to him
Harold was less taciturn
With shrill voice uplifted in solemn chant he sang the great spheral circussong and the undying glory of the Ring
Of its timeless beginning he sang of its fashioning by cosmic forces and of its harmony with the stellar plan
Of horses he sang of their strength their swiftness and their docility as to tricks
Of clowns again of the glory of knavery and of the eternal type that shall endure
Lastly he sang of Herthe Woman of the Ringflawless complete untrammelled in each subtly curving limb earths highest output times noblest expression
At least he doubtless sang all these things and morehe certainly seemed to though all that was distinguishable was Weregointothecircus
and then once more Weregointothecircus
the sweet rhythmic phrase repeated again and again
But indeed I cannot be quite sure for I heard confusedly as in a dream
Wings of fire sprang from the old mares shoulders
We whirled on our way through purple clouds and earth and the rattle of wheels were far away below
The dream and the dizziness were still in my head when I found myself scarce conscious of intermediate steps seated actually in the circus at last and took in the first sniff of that intoxicating circus smell that will stay by me while this clay endures
The place was beset by a hum and a glitter and a mist suspense brooded large oer the blank mysterious arena
Strung up to the highest pitch of expectation we knew not from what quarter in what divine shape the first surprise would come
A thud of unseen hoofs first set us aquiver then a crash of cymbals a jangle of bells a hoarse applauding roar and Coralie was in the midst of us whirling past twixt earth and sky now erect flushed radiant now crouched to the flowing mane swung and tossed and moulded by the maddening dancemusic of the band
The mighty whip of the count in the frockcoat marked time with pistolshots his warcry whooping clear above the music fired the blood with a passion for splendid deeds as Coralie laughing exultant crashed through the paper hoops
We gripped the red cloth in front of us and our souls sped round and round with Coralie leaping with her prone with her swung by mane or tail with her
It was not only the ravishment of her delirious feats nor her cream coloured horse of fairy breed longtailed roefooted an enchanted prince surely if ever there was one
It was her more than mortal beautydisplayed too under conditions never vouchsafed to us beforethat held us spellbound
What princess had arms so dazzlingly white or went delicately clothed in such pink and spangles
Hitherto we had known the outward woman as but a drab thing hourglass shaped nearly legless bunched here constricted there slow of movement and given to deprecating lusty action of limb
Here was a revelation
From henceforth our imaginations would have to be revised and corrected up to date
In one of those swift rushes the mind makes in highstrung moments I saw myself and Coralie close enfolded pacing the world together oer hill and plain through storied cities past rows of applauding relationsI in my Sunday knickerbockers she in her pink and spangles
Summers sicken flowers fail and die all beauty but rides round the ring and out at the portal even so Coralie passed in her turn poised sideways panting on her steed lightly swayed as a tulipbloom bowing on this side and on that as she disappeared and with her went my heart and my soul and all the light and the glory and the entrancement of the scene
Harold woke up with a gasp
Wasnt she beautiful
he said in quite a subdued way for him
I felt a momentary pang
We had been friendly rivals before in many an exploit but here was altogether a more serious affair
Was this then to be the beginning of strife and coldness of civil war on the hearthstone and the sundering of old ties
Then I recollected the true position of things and felt very sorry for Harold for it was inexorably written that he would have to give way to me since I was the elder
Rules were not made for nothing in a sensibly constructed universe
There was little more to wait for now Coralie had gone yet I lingered still on the chance of her appearing again
Next moment the clown tripped up and fell flat with magnificent artifice and at once fresh emotions began to stir
Love had endured its little hour and stern ambition now asserted itself
Oh to be a splendid fellow like this selfcontained ready of speech agile beyond conception braving the forces of society his hand against everyone yet always getting the best of it
What freshness of humour what courtesy to dames what triumphant ability to discomfit rivals frockcoated and moustached though they might be
And what a grand self confident straddle of the legs
Who could desire a finer career than to go through life thus gorgeously equipped
Success was his keynote adroitness his panoply and the mellow music of laughter his instant reward
Even Coralies image wavered and receded
I would come back to her in the evening of course but I would be a clown all the working hours of the day
The short interval was ended the band with longdrawn chords sounded a prelude touched with significance and the programme in letters overtopping their fellows proclaimed Zephyrine the Bride of the Desert in her unequalled bareback equestrian interlude
So sated was I already with beauty and with wit that I hardly dared hope for a fresh emotion
Yet her title was tinged with romance and Coralies display had aroused in me an interest in her sex which even herself had failed to satisfy entirely
Brayed in by trumpets Zephyrine swung passionately into the arena
With a bound she stood erect one foot upon each of her supple plunging Arabs and at once I knew that my fate was sealed my chapter closed and the Bride of the Desert was the one bride for me
Black was her raiment great silver stars shone through it caught in the dusky twilight of her gauze black as her own hair were the two mighty steeds she bestrode
In a tempest they thundered by in a whirlwind a scirocco of tan her cheeks bore the kiss of an Eastern sun and the sand storms of her native desert were her satellites
What was Coralie with her pink silk her golden hair and slender limbs beside this magnificent fullfigured Cleopatra
In a twinkling we were scouring the desertshe and I and the two coal black horses
Side by side keeping pace in our swinging gallop we distanced the ostrich we outstrode the zebra and as we went it seemed the wilderness blossomed like the rose







I know not rightly how we got home that evening
On the road there were everywhere strange presences and the thud of phantom hoofs encircled us
In my nose was the pungent circussmell the crack of the whip and the frank laugh of the clown were in my ears
The funny man thoughtfully abstained from conversation and left our illusion quite alone sparing us all jarring criticism and analysis and he gave me no chance when he deposited us at our gate to get rid of the clumsy expressions of gratitude I had been laboriously framing
For the rest of the evening distraught and silent I only heard the marchmusic of the band playing on in some corner of my brain
When at last my head touched the pillow in a trice I was with Zephyrine riding the boundless Sahara cheek to cheek the world well lost while at times through the sandclouds that encircled us glimmered the eyes of Coralie touched one fancied with something of a tender reproach
ITS WALLS WERE AS OF JASPER In the long winter evenings when we had the picturebooks out on the floor and sprawled together over them with elbows deep in the hearthrug the first business to be gone through was the process of allotment
All the characters in the pictures had to be assigned and dealt out among us according to seniority as far as they would go
When once that had been satisfactorily completed the story was allowed to proceed and thereafter in addition to the excitement of the plot one always possessed a personal interest in some particular member of the cast whose successes or rebuffs one took as so much private gain or loss
For Edward this was satisfactory enough
Claiming his right of the eldest he would annex the hero in the very frontispiece and for the rest of the story his career if chequered at intervals was sure of heroic episodes and a glorious close
But his juniors who had to put up with characters of a clay more mixednay sometimes with undiluted villainywere hard put to it on occasion to defend their other selves as it was strict etiquette to do from ignominy perhaps only too justly merited
Edward was indeed a hopeless grabber
In the Buffalobook for instance so named from the subject of its principal picture though indeed it dealt with varied slaughter in every zone Edward was the stalwart bearded figure with yellow leggings and a powderhorn who undauntedly discharged the fatal bullet into the shoulder of the great bull bison charging home to within a yard of his muzzle
To me was allotted the subsidiary character of the friend who had succeeded in bringing down a cow while Harold had to be content to hold Edwards spare rifle in the background with evident signs of uneasiness
Farther on again where the magnificent chamois sprang rigid into midair Edward crouched dizzily against the precipiceface was the sportsman from whose weapon a puff of white smoke was floating away
A barekneed guide was all that fell to my share while poor Harold had to take the boy with the haversack or abandon for this occasion at least all Alpine ambitions
Of course the girls fared badly in this book and it was not surprising that they preferred the Pilgrims Progress for instance where women had a fair show and there was generally enough of em to go round or a good fairy story wherein princesses met with a healthy appreciation
But indeed we were all best pleased with a picture wherein the characters just fitted us in number sex and qualifications and this to us stood for artistic merit
All the Christmas numbers in their gilt frames on the nursery wall had been gone through and allotted long ago and in these sooner or later each one of us got a chance to figure in some satisfactory and brightly coloured situation
Few of the other pictures about the house afforded equal facilities
They were generally wanting in figures and even when these were present they lacked dramatic interest
In this picture that I have to speak about although the characters had a stupid way of not doing anything and apparently not wanting to do anything there was at least a sufficiency of them so in due course they were allotted too
In itself the picture whichin its ebony and tortoiseshell framehung in a corner of the diningroom had hitherto possessed no special interest for us and would probably never have been dealt with at all but for a revolt of the girls against a succession of books on sport in which the illustrator seemed to have forgotten that there were such things as women in the world
Selina accordingly made for it one rainy morning and announced that she was the lady seated in the centre whose gown of rich flowered brocade fell in such straight severe lines to her feet whose cloak of dark blue was held by a jewelled clasp and whose long fair hair was crowned with a diadem of gold and pearl
Well we had no objection to that it seemed fair enough especially to Edward who promptly proceeded to grab the armourman who stood leaning on his shield at the ladys right hand
A dainty and delicate armourman this
And I confess though I knew it was all right and fair and orderly I felt a slight pang when he passed out of my reach into Edwards possession
His armour was just the sort I wanted myself scalloped and fluted and shimmering and spotless and though he was but a boy by his beardless face and golden hair the shattered spearshaft in his grasp proclaimed him a genuine fighter and fresh from some such agreeable work
Yes I grudged Edward the armourman and when he said I could have the fellow on the other side I hung back and said Id think about it
This fellow had no armour nor weapons but wore a plain jerkin with a leather poucha mere civilianand with one hand he pointed to a wound in his thigh
I didnt care about him and when Harold eagerly put in his claim I gave way and let him have the man
The cause of Harolds anxiety only came out later
It was the wound he coveted it seemed
He wanted to have a big sore wound of his very own and go about and show it to people and excite their envy or win their respect
Charlotte was only too pleased to take the childangel seated at the ladys feet grappling with a musical instrument much too big for her
Charlotte wanted wings badly and next to those a guitar or a banjo
The angel besides wore an amber necklace which took her fancy immensely
This left the picture allotted with the exception of two or three more angels who peeped or perched behind the main figures with a certain subdued drollery in their faces as if the thing had gone on long enough and it was now time to upset something or kick up a row of some sort
We knew these good folk to be saints and angels because we had been told they were otherwise we should never have guessed it
Angels as we knew them in our Sunday books were vapid colourless uninteresting characters with straight upanddown sort of figures white nightgowns white wings and the same straight yellow hair parted in the middle
They were serious even melancholy and we had no desire to have any traffic with them
These bright bejewelled little persons however piquant of face and radiant of feather were evidently hatched from quite a different egg and we felt we might have interests in common with them
Shortnosed shock headed with mouths that went up at the corners and with an evident disregard for all their fine clothes they would be the best of good company we felt sure if only we could manage to get at them
One doubt alone disturbed my mind
In games requiring agility those wings of theirs would give them a tremendous pull
Could they be trusted to play fair
I asked Selina who replied scornfully that angels ALWAYS played fair
But I went back and had another look at the brownfaced one peeping over the back of the ladys chair and still I had my doubts
When Edward went off to school a great deal of adjustment and re allotment took place and all the heroes of illustrated literature were at my call did I choose to possess them
In this particular case however I made no haste to seize upon the armourman
Perhaps it was because I wanted a FRESH saint of my own not a stale saint that Edward had been for so long a time
Perhaps it was rather that ever since I had elected to be saintless I had got into the habit of strolling off into the background and amusing myself with what I found there
A very fascinating background it was and held a great deal though so tiny
Meadowland came first set with flowers blue and red like gems
Then a white road ran with wilful uncalledfor loops up a steep conical hill crowned with towers bastioned walls and belfries and down the road the little knights came riding two and two
The hill on one side descended to water tranquil farreaching and blue and a very curly ship lay at anchor with one mast having an odd sort of crowsnest at the top of it
There was plenty to do in this pleasant land
The annoying thing about it was one could never penetrate beyond a certain point
I might wander up that road as often as I liked I was bound to be brought up at the gateway the funny galleried topheavy gateway of the little walled town
Inside doubtless there were high jinks going on but the password was denied to me
I could get on board a boat and row up as far as the curly ship but around the headland I might not go
On the other side of a surety the shipping lay thick
The merchants walked on the quay and the sailors sang as they swung out the corded bales
But as for me I must stay down in the meadow and imagine it all as best I could
Once I broached the subject to Charlotte and found to my surprise that she had had the same joys and encountered the same disappointments in this delectable country
She too had walked up that road and flattened her nose against that portcullis and she pointed out something that I had overlookedto wit that if you rowed off in a boat to the curly ship and got hold of a rope and clambered aboard of her and swarmed up the mast and got into the crowsnest you could just see over the headland and take in at your ease the life and bustle of the port
She proceeded to describe all the fun that was going on there at such length and with so much particularity that I looked at her suspiciously
Why you talk as if youd been in that crowsnest yourself
I said
Charlotte answered nothing but pursed her mouth up and nodded violently for some minutes and I could get nothing more out of her
I felt rather hurt
Evidently she had managed somehow or other to get up into that crowsnest
Charlotte had got ahead of me on this occasion
It was necessary no doubt that grownup people should dress themselves up and go forth to pay calls
I dont mean that we saw any sense in the practice
It would have been so much more reasonable to stay at home in your old clothes and play
But we recognized that these folk had to do many unaccountable things and after all it was THEIR life and not ours and we were not in a position to criticise
Besides they had many habits more objectionable than this one which to us generally meant a free and untrammelled afternoon wherein to play the devil in our own way
The case was different however when the pressgang was abroad when prayers and excuses were alike disregarded and we were forced into the service like native levies impelled toward the foe less by the inherent righteousness of the cause than by the indisputable rifles of their white allies
This was unpardonable and altogether detestable
Still the thing happened now and again and when it did there was no arguing about it
The order was for the front and we just had to shut up and march
Selina to be sure had a sneaking fondness for dressing up and paying calls though she pretended to dislike it just to keep on the soft side of public opinion
So I thought it extremely mean in her to have the earache on that particular afternoon when Aunt Eliza ordered the ponycarriage and went on the warpath
I was ordered also in the same breath as the ponycarriage and as we eventually trundled off it seemed to me that the utter waste of that afternoon for which I had planned so much could never be made up nor atoned for in all the tremendous stretch of years that still lay before me
The house that we were bound for on this occasion was a big house a generic title applied by us to the class of residence that had a long carriagedrive through rhododendrons and a portico propped by fluted pillars and a grave butler who bolted back swingdoors and came down steps and pretended to have entirely forgotten his familiar intercourse with you at less serious moments and a big hall where no boots or shoes or upper garments were allowed to lie about frankly and easily as with us and where finally people were apt to sit about dressed up as if they were going on to a party
The lady who received us was effusive to Aunt Eliza and hollowly gracious to me
In ten seconds they had their heads together and were hard at it talking CLOTHES
I was left high and dry on a straightbacked chair longing to kick the legs of it yet not daring
For a time I was content to stare there was lots to stare at high and low and around
Then the inevitable fidgets came on and scratching ones legs mitigated slightly but did not entirely disperse them
My two warders were still deep in clothes I slipped off my chair and edged cautiously around the room exploring examining recording
Many strange fine things lay along my routepictures and gimcracks on the walls trinkets and globular old watches and snuffboxes on the tables and I took good care to finger everything within reach thoroughly and conscientiously
Some articles in addition I smelt
At last in my orbit I happened on an open door half concealed by the folds of a curtain
I glanced carefully around
They were still deep in clothes both talking together and I slipped through
This was altogether a more sensible sort of room that I had got into for the walls were honestly upholstered with books though these for the most part glimmered provokingly through the glass doors of their tall cases
I read their titles longingly breathing on every accessible pane of glass for I dared not attempt to open the doors with the enemy encamped so near
In the window though on a high sort of desk there lay all by itself a most promisinglooking book gorgeously bound
I raised the leaves by one corner and like scent from a potpourri jar there floated out a brief vision of blues and reds telling of pictures and pictures all highly coloured
Here was the right sort of thing at last and my afternoon would not be entirely wasted
I inclined an ear to the door by which I had entered
Like the brimming tide of a fullfed river the grand eternal inexhaustible clothesproblem bubbled and eddied and surged along
It seemed safe enough
I slid the book off its desk with some difficulty for it was very fine and large and staggered with it to the hearthrugthe only fit and proper place for books of quality such as this
They were excellent hearthrugs in that house soft and wide with the thickest of pile and ones knees sank into them most comfortably
When I got the book open there was a difficulty at first in making the great stiff pages lie down
Most fortunately the coalscuttle was actually at my elbow and it was easy to find a flat bit of coal to lay on the refractory page
Really it was just as if everything had been arranged for me
This was not such a bad sort of house after all
The beginnings of the thing were gay bordersscrolls and strap work and diapered backgrounds a maze of colour with small misshapen figures clambering cheerily up and down everywhere
But first I eagerly scanned what text there was in the middle in order to get a hint of what it was all about
Of course I was not going to waste any time in reading
A clue a signboard a fingerpost was all I required
To my dismay and disgust it was all in a stupid foreign language
Really the perversity of some people made one at times almost despair of the whole race
However the pictures remained pictures never lied never shuffled nor evaded and as for the story I could invent it myself
Over the page I went shifting the bit of coal to a new position and as the scheme of the picture disengaged itself from out the medley of colour that met my delighted eyes first there was a warm sense of familiarity then a dawning recognition and then O then
along with blissful certainty came the imperious need to clasp my stomach with both hands in order to repress the shout of rapture that struggled to escapeit was my own little city
I knew it well enough I recognized it at once though I had never been quite so near it before
Here was the familiar gateway to the left that strange slender tower with its grim square head shot far above the walls to the right outside the town the hillas of oldbroke steeply down to the sea
But today everything was bigger and fresher and clearer the walls seemed newly hewn gay carpets were hung out over them fair ladies and longhaired children peeped and crowded on the battlements
Better still the portcullis was upI could even catch a glimpse of the sunlit square withinand a dainty company was trooping through the gate on horseback two and two
Their horses in trappings that swept the ground were gay as themselves and THEY were the gayest crew for dress and bearing I had ever yet beheld
It could mean nothing else but a wedding I thought this holiday attire this festal and solemn entry and wedding or whatever it was I meant to be there
This time I would not be balked by any grim portcullis this time I would slip in with the rest of the crowd find out just what my little town was like within those exasperating walls that had so long confronted me and moreover have my share of the fun that was evidently going on inside
Confident yet breathless with expectation I turned the page
Joy
At last I was in it at last I was on the right side of those provoking walls and needless to say I looked about me with much curiosity
A public place clearly though not such as I was used to
The houses at the back stood on a sort of colonnade beneath which the people jostled and crowded
The upper stories were all painted with wonderful pictures
Above the straight line of the roofs the deep blue of a cloudless sky stretched from side to side
Lords and ladies thronged the foreground while on a dais in the centre a gallant gentleman just alighted off his horse stooped to the fingers of a girl as bravely dressed out as Selinas lady between the saints and round about stood venerable personages robed in the most variegated clothing
There were boys too in plenty with tiny red caps on their thick hair and their shirts had bunched up and worked out at the waist just as my own did so often after chasing anybody and each boy of them wore an odd pair of stockings one blue and the other red
This system of attire went straight to my heart
I had tried the same thing so often and had met with so much discouragement and here at last was my justification painted deliberately in a grownup book
I looked about for my saintfriendsthe armour man and the other fellowbut they were not to be seen
Evidently they were unable to get off duty even for a wedding and still stood on guard in that green meadow down below
I was disappointed too that not an angel was visible
One or two of them surely could easily have been spared for an hour to run up and see the show and they would have been thoroughly at home here in the midst of all the colour and the movement and the fun
But it was time to get on for clearly the interest was only just beginning
Over went the next page and there we were the whole crowd of us assembled in a noble church
It was not easy to make out exactly what was going on but in the throng I was delighted to recognize my angels at last happy and very much at home
They had managed to get leave off evidently and must have run up the hill and scampered breathlessly through the gate and perhaps they cried a little when they found the square empty and thought the fun must be all over
Two of them had got hold of a great wax candle apiece as much as they could stagger under and were tittering sideways at each other as the grease ran bountifully over their clothes
A third had strolled in among the company and was chatting to a young gentleman with whom she appeared to be on the best of terms
Decidedly this was the right breed of angel for us
None of your sickbed or night nursery business for them
Well no doubt they were now being married He and She just as always happened
And then of course they were going to live happily ever after and THAT was the part I wanted to get to
Storybooks were so stupid always stopping at the point where they became really nice but this picturestory was only in its first chapters and at last I was to have a chance of knowing HOW people lived happily ever after
We would all go home together He and She and the angels and I and the armourman would be invited to come and stay
And then the story would really begin at the point where those other ones always left off
I turned the page and found myself free of the dim and splendid church and once more in the open country
This was all right this was just as it should be
The sky was a fleckless blue the flags danced in the breeze and our merry bridal party with jest and laughter jogged down to the water side
I was through the town by this time and out on the other side of the hill where I had always wanted to be and sure enough there was the harbour all thick with curly ships
Most of them were piled high with weddingpresentsbales of silk and gold and silver plate and comfortablelooking bags suggesting bullion and the gayest ship of all lay close up to the carpeted landingstage
Already the bride was stepping daintily down the gangway her ladies following primly one by one a few minutes more and we should all be aboard the hawsers would splash in the water the sails would fill and strain
From the deck I should see the little walled town recede and sink and grow dim while every plunge of our bows brought us nearer to the happy islandit was an island we were bound for I knew well
Already I could see the islandpeople waving hands on the crowded quay whence the little houses ran up the hill to the castle crowning all with its towers and battlements
Once more we should ride together a merry procession clattering up the steep street and through the grim gateway and then we should have arrived then we should all dine together then we should have reached home
And then OW
OW
OW
Bitter it is to stumble out of an opalescent dream into the cold daylight cruel to lose in a second a seavoyage an island and a castle that was to be practically your own but cruellest and bitterest of all to know in addition to your loss that the fingers of an angry aunt have you tight by the scruff of your neck
My beautiful book was gone tooravished from my grasp by the dressy lady who joined in the outburst of denunciation as heartily as if she had been a relativeand naught was left me but to blubber dismally awakened of a sudden to the harshness of real things and the unnumbered hostilities of the actual world
I cared little for their reproaches their abuse but I sorrowed heartily for my lost ship my vanished island my uneaten dinner and for the knowledge that if I wanted any angels to play with I must henceforth put up with the anaemic nightgowned nonentities that hovered over the bed of the Sundayschool child in the pages of the Sabbath Improver
I was led ignominiously out of the house in a pulpy watery state while the butler handled his swing doors with a stony impassive countenance intended for the deception of the very elect though it did not deceive me
I knew well enough that next time he was off duty and strolled around our way we should meet in our kitchen as man to man and I would punch him and ask him riddles and he would teach me tricks with corks and bits of string
So his unsympathetic manner did not add to my depression
I maintained a diplomatic blubber long after we had been packed into our ponycarriage and the lodgegate had clicked behind us because it served as a sort of armourplating against heckling and argument and abuse and I was thinking hard and wanted to be let alone
And the thoughts that I was thinking were two
First I thought Ive got ahead of Charlotte THIS time
And next I thought When Ive grown up big and have money of my own and a fullsized walkingstick I will set out early one morning and never stop till I get to that little walled town
There ought to be no real difficulty in the task
It only meant asking here and asking there and people were very obliging and I could describe every stick and stone of it
As for the island which I had never even seen that was not so easy
Yet I felt confident that somehow at some time sooner or later I was destined to arrive
A SAGA OF THE SEAS It happened one day that some ladies came to call who were not at all the sort I was used to
They suffered from a grievance so far as I could gather and the burden of their plaint was ManMen in general and Man in particular
Though the words were but spoken I could clearly discern the capital M in their acid utterance
Of course I was not present officially so to speak
Down below in my subworld of chairlegs and hearthrugs and the undersides of sofas I was working out my own floorproblems while they babbled on far above my head considering me as but a chairleg or even something lower in the scale
Yet I was listening hard all the time with that respectful consideration one gives to all grownup peoples remarks so long as one knows no better
It seemed a serious indictment enough as they rolled it out
In tact considerateness and right appreciation as well as in taste and aesthetic sensibilitieswe failed at every point we breeched and bearded prenticejobs of Nature and I began to feel like collapsing on the carpet from sheer spiritual anaemia
But when one of them with a swing of her skirt prostrated a whole regiment of my brave tin soldiers and never apologized nor even offered her aid toward revivifying the battleline I could not help feeling that in tactfulness and consideration for others she was still a little to seek
And I said as much with some directness of language
That was the end of me from a society point of view
Rudeness to visitors was the unpardonable sin and in two seconds I had my marching orders and was sullenly wending my way to the St Elelena of the nursery
As I climbed the stair my thoughts reverted somehow to a game we had been playing that very morning
It was the good old game of Raftsa game that will be played till all the oceans are dry and all the trees in the world are felledand after
And we were all crowded together on the precarious little platform and Selina occupied every bit as much room as I did and Charlottes legs didnt dangle over any more than Harolds
The pitiless sun overhead beat on us all with tropic impartiality and the hungry sharks whose fins scored the limitless Pacific stretching out on every side were impelled by an appetite that made no exceptions as to sex
When we shared the ultimate biscuit and circulated the last waterkeg the girls got an absolute fourth apiece and neither more nor less and the only partiality shown was entirely in favour of Charlotte who was allowed to perceive and to hail the saviour sail on the horizon
And this was only because it was her turn to do so not because she happened to be this or that
Surely the rules of the raft were the rules of life and in what then did these visitorladies grievance consist
Puzzled and a little sulky I pushed open the door of the deserted nursery where the raft that had rocked beneath so many hopes and fears still occupied the oceanfloor
To the dull eye that merely tarries upon the outsides of things it might have appeared unromantic and even unraftlike consisting only as it did of a round spongebath on a bald deal towelhorse placed flat on the floor
Even to myself much of the recent raftglamour seemed to have departed as I halfmechanically stepped inside and curled myself up in it for a solitary voyage
Once I was in however the old magic and mystery returned in full flood when I discovered that the inequalities of the towelhorse caused the bath to rock slightly indeed but easily and incessantly
A few minutes of this delightful motion and one was fairly launched
So those women below didnt want us
Well there were other women and other places that did
And this was going to be no scrambling raftaffair but a fullblooded voyage of the Man equipped and purposeful in search of what was his rightful own
Whither should I shape my course and what sort of vessel should I charter for the voyage
The shipping of all England was mine to pick from and the far corners of the globe were my rightful inheritance
A frigate of course seemed the natural vehicle for a boy of spirit to set out in
And yet there was something rather uppish in commanding a frigate at the very first setoff and little spread was left for the ambition
Frigates too could always be acquired later by sheer adventure and your real hero generally saved up a squarerigged ship for the final achievement and the rapt return
No it was a schooner that I was aboard ofa schooner whose masts raked devilishly as the leaping seas hissed along her low black gunwale
Many hairbrained youths started out on a mere cutter but I was prudent and besides I had some inkling of the serious affairs that were ahead
I have said I was already on board and indeed on this occasion I was too hungry for adventure to linger over what would have been a special delight at a period of more leisurethe dangling about the harbour the choosing your craft selecting your shipmates stowing your cargo and fitting up your private cabin with everything you might want to put your hand on in any emergency whatever
I could not wait for that
Out beyond soundings the big seas were racing westward and calling me albatrosses hovered motionless expectant of a comrade and a thousand islands held each of them a fresh adventure stored up hidden away awaiting production expressly saved for me
We were humming closehauled down the Channel spray in the eyes and the shrouds thrilling musically in much less time than the average man would have taken to transfer his Gladstone bag and his rugs from the train to a sheltered place on the promenade deck of the tame daily steamer
So long as we were in pilotage I stuck manfully to the wheel
The undertaking was mine and with it all its responsibilities and there was some tricky steering to be done as we sped by headland and bay ere we breasted the great seas outside and the land fell away behind us
But as soon as the Atlantic had opened out I began to feel that it would be rather nice to take tea by myself in my own cabin and it therefore became necessary to invent a comrade or two to take their turn at the wheel
This was easy enough
A friend or two of my own age from among the boys I knew a friend or two from characters in the books I knew and a friend or two from Nomansland where every fellows a born sailor and the crew was complete
I addressed them on the poop divided them into watches gave instructions I should be summoned on the first sign of pirates whales or Frenchmen and retired below to a wellearned spell of relaxation
That was the right sort of cabin that I stepped into shutting the door behind me with a click
Of course firearms were the first thing I looked for and there they were sure enough in their racks dozens of emdoublebarrelled guns and repeatingrifles and long pistols and shiny plated revolvers
I rang up the steward and ordered tea with scones and jam in its native potsnone of your finicking shallow glass dishes and when properly streaked with jam and blown out with tea I went through the armoury clicked the rifles and revolvers tested the edges of the cutlasses with my thumb and filled the cartridgebelts chockfull
Everything was there and of the best quality just as if I had spent a whole fortnight knocking about Plymouth and ordering things
Clearly if this cruise came to grief it would not be for want of equipment
Just as I was beginning on the lockers and the drawers the watch reported icebergs on both bowsand what was more to the point coveys of Polar bears on the icebergs
I grasped a rifle or two and hastened on deck
The spectacle was indeed magnificentit generally is with icebergs on both bows and these were exceptionally enormous icebergs
But I hadnt come there to paint Academy pictures so the captains gig was in the water and manned almost ere the boatswains whistle had ceased sounding and we were pulling hard for the Polar bearsmyself and the rifles in the sternsheets
I have rarely enjoyed better shooting than I got during that afternoons tramp over the icebergs
Perhaps I was in specially good form perhaps the bears rose well
Anyhow the bag was a portentous one
In later days on reading of the growing scarcity of Polar bears my conscience has pricked me but that afternoon I experienced no compunction
Nevertheless when the huge pile of skins had been hoisted on board and a stiff grog had been served out to the crew of the captains gig I ordered the schooners head to be set due south
For icebergs were played out for the moment and it was getting to be time for something more tropical
Tropical was a mild expression of what was to come as was shortly proved
It was about three bells in the next days forenoon watch when the lookout man first sighted the pirate brigantine
I disliked the looks of her from the first and after piping all hands to quarters had the brass carronade on the foredeck crammed with grape to the muzzle
This proved a wise precaution
For the flagitious pirate craft having crept up to us under the colours of the Swiss Republic a state with which we were just then on the best possible terms suddenly shook out the skullandcrossbones at her masthead and let fly with roundshot at close quarters knocking into pieces several of my crew who could ill be spared
The sight of their disconnected limbs aroused my ire to its utmost height and I let them have the contents of the brass carronade with ghastly effect
Next moment the hulls of the two ships were grinding together the cold steel flashed from its scabbard and the deathgrapple had begun
In spite of the deadly work of my grapegorged carronade our foe still outnumbered us I reckoned by three to one
Honour forbade my fixing it at a lower figurethis was the minimum rate at which one dared to do business with pirates
They were stark veterans too every man seamed with ancient sabrecuts whereas my crew had many of them hardly attained the maturity which is the gift of ten long summersand the whole thing was so sudden that I had no time to invent a reinforcement of riper years
It was not surprising therefore that my dauntless boarding party axe in hand and cutlass between teeth fought their way to the pirates deck only to be repulsed again and yet again and that our planks were soon slippery with our own ungrudged and inexhaustible blood
At this critical point in the conflict the bosun grasping me by the arm drew my attention to a magnificent British manofwar just hove to in the offing while the signalman his glass at his eye reported that she was inquiring whether we wanted any assistance or preferred to go through with the little job ourselves
This veiled attempt to share our laurels with us courteously as it was worded put me on my mettle
Wiping the blood out of my eyes I ordered the signalman to reply instantly with the half dozen or so of flags that he had at his disposal that much as we appreciated the valour of the regular service and the delicacy of spirit that animated its commanders still this was an orthodox case of the young gentlemanadventurer versus the unshaved pirate and Her Majestys Marine had nothing to do but to form the usual admiring and applauding background
Then rallying round me the remnant of my faithful crew I selected a fresh cutlass I had worn out three already and plunged once more into the pleasing carnage
The result was not long doubtful
Indeed I could not allow it to be as I was already getting somewhat bored with the pirate business and was wanting to get on to something more southern and sensuous
All serious resistance came to an end as soon as I had reached the quarterdeck and cut down the pirate chiefa fine blackbearded fellow in his way but hardly up to date in his parryandthrust business
Those whom our cutlasses had spared were marched out along their own plank in the approved old fashion and in time the scuppers relieved the decks of the blood that made traffic temporarily impossible
And all the time the Britishmanofwar admired and applauded in the offing
As soon as we had got through with the necessary throatcutting and swabbingup all hands set to work to discover treasure and soon the deck shone bravely with ingots and Mexican dollars and church plate
There were ropes of pearls too and big stacks of nougat and rubies and gold watches and Turkish Delight in tubs
But I left these trifles to my crew and continued the search alone
For by this time I had determined that there should be a Princess on board carried off to be sold in captivity to the bold bad Moors and now with beating heart awaiting her rescue by me the Perseus of her dreams
I came upon her at last in the big statecabin in the stern and she wore a holland pinafore over her Princessclothes and she had brown wavy hair hanging down her back just likewell never mind she had brown wavy hair
When gentlefolk meet courtesies pass and I will not weary other people with relating all the compliments and countercompliments that we exchanged all in the most approved manner
Occasions like this when tongues wagged smoothly and speech flowed free were always especially pleasing to me who am naturally inclined to be tonguetied with women
But at last ceremony was over and we sat on the table and swung our legs and agreed to be fast friends
And I showed her my latest knifeonebladed horn handled terrific hung round my neck with string and she showed me the chiefest treasures the ship contained hidden away in a most private and particular lockera musical box with a glass top that let you see the works and a railway train with real lines and a real tunnel and a tin ironclad that followed a magnet and was ever so much handier in many respects than the real fullsized thing that still lay and applauded in the offing
There was high feasting that night in my cabin
We invited the captain of the manofwarone could hardly do less it seemed to meand the Princess took one end of the table and I took the other and the captain was very kind and nice and told us fairy stories and asked us both to come and stay with him next Christmas and promised we should have some hunting on real ponies
When he left I gave him some ingots and things and saw him into his boat and then I went round the ship and addressed the crew in several set speeches which moved them deeply and with my own hands loaded up the carronade with grapeshot till it ran over at the mouth
This done I retired into the cabin with the Princess and locked the door
And first we started the musical box taking turns to wind it up and then we made toffee in the cabinstove and then we ran the train round and round the room and through and through the tunnel and lastly we swam the tin ironclad in the bath with the soapdish for a pirate
Next morning the air was rich with spices porpoises rolled and gambolled round the bows and the South Sea Islands lay full in view they were the REAL South Sea Islands of coursenot the badly furnished journeymenislands that are to be perceived on the map
As for the pirate brigantine and the manofwar I dont really know what became of them
They had played their part very well for the time but I wasnt going to bother to account for them so I just let them evaporate quietly
The islands provided plenty of fresh occupation
For here were little bays of silvery sand dotted with landcrabs groves of palmtrees wherein monkeys frisked and pelted each other with cocoanuts and caves and sites for stockades and hidden treasures significantly indicated by skulls in riotous plenty while birds and beasts of every colour and all latitudes made pleasing noises which excited the sporting instinct
The islands lay conveniently close together which necessitated careful steering as we threaded the devious and intricate channels that separated them
Of course no one else could be trusted at the wheel so it is not surprising that for some time I quite forgot that there was such a thing as a Princess on board
This is too much the masculine way whenever theres any real business doing
However I remembered her as soon as the anchor was dropped and I went below and consoled her and we had breakfast together and she was allowed to pour out which quite made up for everything
When breakfast was over we ordered out the captains gig and rowed all about the islands and paddled and explored and hunted bisons and beetles and butterflies and found everything we wanted
And I gave her pink shells and tortoises and great milky pearls and little green lizards and she gave me guineapigs and coral to make into waistcoatbuttons and tame seaotters and a real pirates powderhorn
It was a prolific day and a longlasting one and weary were we with all our hunting and our getting and our gathering when at last we clambered into the captains gig and rowed back to a late tea
The following day my conscience rose up and accused me
This was not what I had come out to do
These triflings with pearls and parrakeets these al fresco luncheons off yams and bananas there was no making of history about them I resolved that without further dallying I would turn to and capture the French frigate according to the original programme
So we upped anchor with the morning tide and set all sail for San Salvador
Of course I had no idea where San Salvador really was
I havent now for that matter
But it seemed a rightsounding sort of name for a place that was to have a bay that was to hold a French frigate that was to be cut out so as I said we sailed for San Salvador and made the bay about eight bells that evening and saw the topmasts of the frigate over the headland that sheltered her
And forthwith there was summoned a Council of War
It is a very serious matter a Council of War
We had not held one hitherto pirates and truck of that sort not calling for such solemn treatment
But in an affair that might almost be called international it seemed well to proceed gravely and by regular steps
So we met in my cabinthe Princess and the bosun and a boy from the reallife lot and a man from among the bookmen and a fellow from Nomansland and myself in the chair
The bosun had taken part in so many cuttingsout during his past career that practically he did all the talking and was the Council of War himself
It was to be an affair of boats he explained
A boatscrew would be told off to cut the cables and two boatscrews to climb stealthily on board and overpower the sleeping Frenchmen and two more boats crews to haul the doomed vessel out of the bay
This made rather a demand on my limited resources as to crews but I was prepared to stretch a point in a case like this and I speedily brought my numbers up to the requisite efficiency
The night was both moonless and starlessI had arranged all thatwhen the boats pushed off from the side of our vessel and made their way toward the ship that unfortunately for itself had been singled out by Fate to carry me home in triumph
I was in excellent spirits and indeed as I stepped over the side a lawless idea crossed my mind of discovering another Princess on board the frigatea French one this time I had heard that that sort was rather nice
But I abandoned the notion at once recollecting that the heroes of all history had always been noted for their unswerving constancy
The French captain was snug in bed when I clambered in through his cabin window and held a naked cutlass to his throat
Naturally he was surprised and considerably alarmed till I discharged one of my set speeches at him pointing out that my men already had his crew under hatchways that his vessel was even then being towed out of harbour and that on his accepting the situation with a good grace his person and private property would be treated with all the respect due to the representative of a great nation for which I entertained feelings of the profoundest admiration and regard and all that sort of thing
It was a beautiful speech
The Frenchman at once presented me with his parole in the usual way and in a reply of some power and pathos only begged that I would retire a moment while he put on his trousers
This I gracefully consented to do and the incident ended
Two of my boats were sunk by the fire from the forts on the shore and several brave fellows were severely wounded in the handtohand struggle with the French crew for the possession of the frigate
But the bosuns admirable strategy and my own reckless gallantry in securing the French captain at the outset had the fortunate result of keeping down the deathrate
It was all for the sake of the Princess that I had arranged so comparatively tame a victory
For myself I rather liked a fair amount of bloodletting redhot shot and flying splinters
But when you have girls about the place they have got to be considered to a certain extent
There was another supperparty that night in my cabin as soon as we had got well out to sea and the French captain who was the guest of the evening was in the greatest possible form
We became sworn friends and exchanged invitations to come and stay at each others homes and really it was quite difficult to induce him to take his leave
But at last he and his crew were bundled into their boats and after I had pressed some pirate bullion upon themdelicately of course but in a pleasant manner that admitted of no denialthe gallant fellows quite broke down and we parted our bosoms heaving with a full sense of each others magnanimity and goodfellowship
The next day which was nearly all taken up with shifting our quarters into the new frigate so honourably and easily acquired was a very pleasant one as everyone who has gone up in the world and moved into a larger house will readily understand
At last I had grim black guns all along each side instead of a rotten brass carronade at last I had a squarerigged ship with real yards and a proper quarterdeck
In fact now that I had soared as high as could be hoped in a single voyage it seemed about time to go home and cut a dash and show off a bit
The worst of this oceantheatre was it held no proper audience
It was hard of course to relinquish all the adventures that still lay untouched in these Southern seas
Whaling for instance had not yet been entered upon the joys of exploration and strange inland cities innocent of the white man still awaited me and the book of wrecks and rescues was not yet even opened
But I had achieved a frigate and a Princess and that was not so bad for a beginning and more than enough to show off with before those dull unadventurous folk who continued on their millhorse round at home
The voyage home was a record one so far as mere speed was concerned and all adventures were scornfully left behind as we rattled along for other adventurers who had still their laurels to win
Hardly later than the noon of next day we dropped anchor in Plymouth Sound and heard the intoxicating clamour of bells the roar of artillery and the hoarse cheers of an excited populace surging down to the quays that told us we were being appreciated at something like our true merits
The Lord Mayor was waiting there to receive us and with him several Admirals of the Fleet as we walked down the lane of pushing enthusiastic Devonians the Princess and I and our warworn weatherbeaten spoilladen crew
Everybody was very nice about the French frigate and the pirate booty and the scars still fresh on our young limbs yet I think what I liked best of all was that they all pronounced the Princess to be a duck and a peerless brown haired darling and a true mate for a hero and of the right Princessbreed
The air was thick with invitations and with the smell of civic banquets in a forward stage but I sternly waved all festivities aside
The coachesandfour I had ordered immediately on arriving were blocking the whole of the High Street the champing of bits and the pawing of gravel summoned us to take our seats and be off to where the real performance awaited us compared with which all this was but an interlude
I placed the Princess in the most highly gilded coach of the lot and mounted to my place at her side and the rest of the crew scrambled on board of the others as best they might
The whips cracked and the crowd scattered and cheered as we broke into a gallop for home
The noisy bells burst into a farewell peal Yes that was undoubtedly the usual bell for schoolroom tea
And high time too I thought as I tumbled out of the bath which was beginning to feel very hard to the projecting portions of my framework
As I trotted downstairs hungrier even than usual farewells floated up from the front door and I heard the departing voices of our angular elderly visitors as they made their way down the walk
Man was still catching it apparently Man was getting it hot
And much Man cared
The seas were his and their islands he had his frigates for the taking his pirates and their hoards for an unregarded cutlassstroke or two and there were Princesses in plenty waiting for him somewhere Princesses of the right sort
THE RELUCTANT DRAGON Footprints in the snow have been unfailing provokers of sentiment ever since snow was first a white wonder in this drabcoloured world of ours
In a poetrybook presented to one of us by an aunt there was a poem by one Wordsworth in which they stood out stronglywith a picture all to themselves toobut we didnt think very highly either of the poem or the sentiment
Footprints in the sand now were quite another matter and we grasped Crusoes attitude of mind much more easily than Wordsworths
Excitement and mystery curiosity and suspense these were the only sentiments that tracks whether in sand or in snow were able to arouse in us
We had awakened early that winter morning puzzled at first by the added light that filled the room
Then when the truth at last fully dawned on us and we knew that snowballing was no longer a wistful dream but a solid certainty waiting for us outside it was a mere brute fight for the necessary clothes and the lacing of boots seemed a clumsy invention and the buttoning of coats an unduly tedious form of fastening with all that snow going to waste at our very door
When dinnertime came we had to be dragged in by the scruff of our necks
The short armistice over the combat was resumed but presently Charlotte and I a little weary of contests and of missiles that ran shudderingly down inside ones clothes forsook the trampled battlefield of the lawn and went exploring the blank virgin spaces of the white world that lay beyond
It stretched away unbroken on every side of us this mysterious soft garment under which our familiar world had so suddenly hidden itself
Faint imprints showed where a casual bird had alighted but of other traffic there was next to no sign which made these strange tracks all the more puzzling
We came across them first at the corner of the shrubbery and pored over them long our hands on our knees
Experienced trappers that we knew ourselves to be it was annoying to be brought up suddenly by a beast we could not at once identify
Dont you know
said Charlotte rather scornfully
Thought you knew all the beasts that ever was
This put me on my mettle and I hastily rattled off a string of animal names embracing both the arctic and the tropic zones but without much real confidence
No said Charlotte on consideration they wont any of em quite do
Seems like something LIZARDY
Did you say a iguanodon
Might be that praps
But thats not British and we want a real British beast
I think its a dragon
T isnt half big enough I objected
Well all dragons must be small to begin with said Charlotte like everything else
Praps this is a little dragon whos got lost
A little dragon would be rather nice to have
He might scratch and spit but he couldnt DO anything really
Lets track him down
So we set off into the wide snowclad world hand in hand our hearts big with expectationcomplacently confident that by a few smudgy traces in the snow we were in a fair way to capture a halfgrown specimen of a fabulous beast
We ran the monster across the paddock and along the hedge of the next field and then he took to the road like any tame civilized taxpayer
Here his tracks became blended with and lost among more ordinary footprints but imagination and a fixed idea will do a great deal and we were sure we knew the direction a dragon would naturally take
The traces too kept reappearing at intervalsat least Charlotte maintained they did and as it was HER dragon I left the following of the slot to her and trotted along peacefully feeling that it was an expedition anyhow and something was sure to come out of it
Charlotte took me across another field or two and through a copse and into a fresh road and I began to feel sure it was only her confounded pride that made her go on pretending to see dragontracks instead of owning she was entirely at fault like a reasonable person
At last she dragged me excitedly through a gap in a hedge of an obviously private character the waste open world of field and hedgerow disappeared and we found ourselves in a garden wellkept secluded most undragon haunted in appearance
Once inside I knew where we were
This was the garden of my friend the circusman though I had never approached it before by a lawless gap from this unfamiliar side
And here was the circusman himself placidly smoking a pipe as he strolled up and down the walks
I stepped up to him and asked him politely if he had lately seen a Beast
May I inquire he said with all civility what particular sort of a Beast you may happen to be looking for
Its a LIZARDY sort of Beast I explained
Charlotte says its a dragon but she doesnt really know much about beasts
The circusman looked round about him slowly
I dont THINK he said that Ive seen a dragon in these parts recently
But if I come across one Ill know it belongs to you and Ill have him taken round to you at once
Thank you very much said Charlotte but dont TROUBLE about it please cos praps it isnt a dragon after all
Only I thought I saw his little footprints in the snow and we followed em up and they seemed to lead right in here but maybe its all a mistake and thank you all the same
Oh no trouble at all said the circusman cheerfully
I should be only too pleased
But of course as you say it MAY be a mistake
And its getting dark and he seems to have got away for the present whatever he is
Youd better come in and have some tea
Im quite alone and well make a roaring fire and Ive got the biggest Book of Beasts you ever saw
Its got every beast in the world and all of em coloured and well try and find YOUR beast in it
We were always ready for tea at any time and especially when combined with beasts
There was marmalade too and apricotjam brought in expressly for us and afterwards the beastbook was spread out and as the man had truly said it contained every sort of beast that had ever been in the world
The striking of six oclock set the more prudent Charlotte nudging me and we recalled ourselves with an effort from Beast land and reluctantly stood up to go
Here Im coming along with you said the circusman
I want another pipe and a walkll do me good
You neednt talk to me unless you like
Our spirits rose to their wonted level again
The way had seemed so long the outside world so dark and eerie after the bright warm room and the highlycoloured beastbook
But a walk with a real Manwhy that was a treat in itself
We set off briskly the Man in the middle
I looked up at him and wondered whether I should ever live to smoke a big pipe with that careless sort of majesty
But Charlotte whose young mind was not set on tobacco as a possible goal made herself heard from the other side
Now then she said tell us a story please wont you
The Man sighed heavily and looked about him
I knew it he groaned
I KNEW I should have to tell a story
Oh why did I leave my pleasant fireside
Well I WILL tell you a story
Only let me think a minute
So he thought a minute and then he told us this story
Long agomight have been hundreds of years agoin a cottage halfway between this village and yonder shoulder of the Downs up there a shepherd lived with his wife and their little son
Now the shepherd spent his daysand at certain times of the year his nights tooup on the wide oceanbosom of the Downs with only the sun and the stars and the sheep for company and the friendly chattering world of men and women far out of sight and hearing
But his little son when he wasnt helping his father and often when he was as well spent much of his time buried in big volumes that he borrowed from the affable gentry and interested parsons of the country round about
And his parents were very fond of him and rather proud of him too though they didnt let on in his hearing so he was left to go his own way and read as much as he liked and instead of frequently getting a cuff on the side of the head as might very well have happened to him he was treated more or less as an equal by his parents who sensibly thought it a very fair division of labour that they should supply the practical knowledge and he the booklearning
They knew that booklearning often came in useful at a pinch in spite of what their neighbours said
What the Boy chiefly dabbled in was natural history and fairytales and he just took them as they came in a sandwichy sort of way without making any distinctions and really his course of reading strikes one as rather sensible
One evening the shepherd who for some nights past had been disturbed and preoccupied and off his usual mental balance came home all of a tremble and sitting down at the table where his wife and son were peacefully employed she with her seam he in following out the adventures of the Giant with no Heart in his Body exclaimed with much agitation Its all up with me Maria
Never no more can I go up on them there Downs was it ever so
Now dont you take on like that said his wife who was a VERY sensible woman but tell us all about it first whatever it is as has given you this shakeup and then me and you and the son here between us we ought to be able to get to the bottom of it
It began some nights ago said the shepherd
You know that cave up thereI never liked it somehow and the sheep never liked it neither and when sheep dont like a thing theres generally some reason for it
Well for some time past theres been faint noises coming from that cavenoises like heavy sighings with grunts mixed up in them and sometimes a snoring far away downREAL snoring yet somehow not HONEST snoring like you and me onights you know
I know remarked the Boy quietly
Of course I was terrible frightened the shepherd went on yet somehow I couldnt keep away
So this very evening before I come down I took a cast round by the cave quietly
And thereO Lord
there I saw him at last as plain as I see you
Saw WHO
said his wife beginning to share in her husbands nervous terror
Why HIM Im a telling you
said the shepherd
He was sticking halfway out of the cave and seemed to be enjoying of the cool of the evening in a poetical sort of way
He was as big as four carthorses and all covered with shiny scalesdeepblue scales at the top of him shading off to a tender sort o green below
As he breathed there was that sort of flicker over his nostrils that you see over our chalk roads on a baking windless day in summer
He had his chin on his paws and I should say he was meditating about things
Oh yes a peaceable sort o beast enough and not ramping or carrying on or doing anything but what was quite right and proper
I admit all that
And yet what am I to do
SCALES you know and claws and a tail for certain though I didnt see that end of himI aint USED to em and I dont HOLD with em and thats a fact
The Boy who had apparently been absorbed in his book during his fathers recital now closed the volume yawned clasped his hands behind his head and said sleepily Its all right father
Dont you worry
Its only a dragon
Only a dragon
cried his father
What do you mean sitting there you and your dragons
ONLY a dragon indeed
And what do YOU know about it
Cos it IS and cos I DO know replied the Boy quietly
Look here father you know weve each of us got our line
YOU know about sheep and weather and things I know about dragons
I always said you know that that cave up there was a dragoncave
I always said it must have belonged to a dragon some time and ought to belong to a dragon now if rules count for anything
Well now you tell me it HAS got a dragon and so THATS all right
Im not half as much surprised as when you told me it HADNT got a dragon
Rules always come right if you wait quietly
Now please just leave this all to me
And Ill stroll up tomorrow morningno in the morning I cant Ive got a whole heap of things to dowell perhaps in the evening if Im quite free Ill go up and have a talk to him and youll find itll be all right
Only please dont you go worrying round there without me
You dont understand em a bit and theyre very sensitive you know
Hes quite right father said the sensible mother
As he says dragons is his line and not ours
Hes wonderful knowing about bookbeasts as every one allows
And to tell the truth Im not half happy in my own mind thinking of that poor animal lying alone up there without a bit o hot supper or anyone to change the news with and maybe well be able to do something for him and if he aint quite respectable our Boyll find it out quick enough
Hes got a pleasant sort o way with him that makes everybody tell him everything
Next day after hed had his tea the Boy strolled up the chalky track that led to the summit of the Downs and there sure enough he found the dragon stretched lazily on the sward in front of his cave
The view from that point was a magnificent one
To the right and left the bare and billowy leagues of Downs in front the vale with its clustered homesteads its threads of white roads running through orchards and well tilled acreage and far away a hint of grey old cities on the horizon
A cool breeze played over the surface of the grass and the silver shoulder of a large moon was showing above distant junipers
No wonder the dragon seemed in a peaceful and contented mood indeed as the Boy approached he could hear the beast purring with a happy regularity
Well we live and learn
he said to himself
None of my books ever told me that dragons purred
Hullo dragon
said the Boy quietly when he had got up to him
The dragon on hearing the approaching footsteps made the beginning of a courteous effort to rise
But when he saw it was a Boy he set his eyebrows severely
Now dont you hit me he said or bung stones or squirt water or anything
I wont have it I tell you
Not goin to hit you said the Boy wearily dropping on the grass beside the beast and dont for goodness sake keep on saying Dont I hear so much of it and its monotonous and makes me tired
Ive simply looked in to ask you how you were and all that sort of thing but if Im in the way I can easily clear out
Ive lots of friends and no one can say Im in the habit of shoving myself in where Im not wanted
No no dont go off in a huff said the dragon hastily fact isIm as happy up here as the days long never without an occupation dear fellow never without an occupation
And yet between ourselves it IS a trifle dull at times
The Boy bit off a stalk of grass and chewed it
Going to make a long stay here
he asked politely
Cant hardly say at present replied the dragon
It seems a nice place enoughbut Ive only been here a short time and one must look about and reflect and consider before settling down
Its rather a serious thing settling down
Besidesnow Im going to tell you something
Youd never guess it if you tried ever sofact is Im such a confoundedly lazy beggar
You surprise me said the Boy civilly
Its the sad truth the dragon went on settling down between his paws and evidently delighted to have found a listener at last and I fancy thats really how I came to be here
You see all the other fellows were so active and EARNEST and all that sort of thingalways rampaging and skirmishing and scouring the desert sands and pacing the margin of the sea and chasing knights all over the place and devouring damsels and going on generallywhereas I liked to get my meals regular and then to prop my back against a bit of rock and snooze a bit and wake up and think of things going on and how they kept going on just the same you know
So when it happened I got fairly caught
When WHAT happened please
asked the Boy
Thats just what I dont precisely know said the dragon
I suppose the earth sneezed or shook itself or the bottom dropped out of something
Anyhow there was a shake and a roar and a general stramash and I found myself miles away underground and wedged in as tight as tight
Well thank goodness my wants are few and at any rate I had peace and quietness and wasnt always being asked to come along and DO something
And Ive got such an active mindalways occupied I assure you
But time went on and there was a certain sameness about the life and at last I began to think it would be fun to work my way upstairs and see what you other fellows were doing
So I scratched and burrowed and worked this way and that way and at last I came out through this cave here
And I like the country and the view and the peoplewhat Ive seen of emand on the whole I feel inclined to settle down here
Whats your mind always occupied about
asked the Boy
Thats what I want to know
The dragon coloured slightly and looked away
Presently he said bashfully Did you everjust for funtry to make up poetryverses you know
Course I have said the Boy
Heaps of it
And some of its quite good I feel sure only theres no one here cares about it
Mothers very kind and all that when I read it to her and sos father for that matter
But somehow they dont seem to Exactly cried the dragon my own case exactly
They dont seem to and you cant argue with em about it
Now youve got culture you have I could tell it on you at once and I should just like your candid opinion about some little things I threw off lightly when I was down there
Im awfully pleased to have met you and Im hoping the other neighbours will be equally agreeable
There was a very nice old gentleman up here only last night but he didnt seem to want to intrude
That was my father said the boy and he IS a nice old gentleman and Ill introduce you some day if you like
Cant you two come up here and dine or something tomorrow
asked the dragon eagerly
Only of course if youve got nothing better to do he added politely
Thanks awfully said the Boy but we dont go out anywhere without my mother and to tell you the truth Im afraid she mightnt quite approve of you
You see theres no getting over the hard fact that youre a dragon is there
And when you talk of settling down and the neighbours and so on I cant help feeling that you dont quite realize your position
Youre an enemy of the human race you see
Havent got an enemy in the world said the dragon cheerfully
Too lazy to make em to begin with
And if I DO read other fellows my poetry Im always ready to listen to theirs
Oh dear
cried the boy I wish youd try and grasp the situation properly
When the other people find you out theyll come after you with spears and swords and all sorts of things
Youll have to be exterminated according to their way of looking at it
Youre a scourge and a pest and a baneful monster
Not a word of truth in it said the dragon wagging his head solemnly
Characterll bear the strictest investigation
And now theres a little sonnetthing I was working on when you appeared on the scene Oh if you WONT be sensible cried the Boy getting up Im going off home
No I cant stop for sonnets my mothers sitting up
Ill look you up tomorrow sometime or other and do for goodness sake try and realize that youre a pestilential scourge or youll find yourself in a most awful fix
Good night
The Boy found it an easy matter to set the mind of his parents at ease about his new friend
They had always left that branch to him and they took his word without a murmur
The shepherd was formally introduced and many compliments and kind inquiries were exchanged
His wife however though expressing her willingness to do anything she couldto mend things or set the cave to rights or cook a little something when the dragon had been poring over sonnets and forgotten his meals as male things WILL do could not be brought to recognize him formally
The fact that he was a dragon and they didnt know who he was seemed to count for everything with her
She made no objection however to her little son spending his evenings with the dragon quietly so long as he was home by nine oclock and many a pleasant night they had sitting on the sward while the dragon told stories of old old times when dragons were quite plentiful and the world was a livelier place than it is now and life was full of thrills and jumps and surprises
What the Boy had feared however soon came to pass
The most modest and retiring dragon in the world if hes as big as four carthorses and covered with blue scales cannot keep altogether out of the public view
And so in the village tavern of nights the fact that a real live dragon sat brooding in the cave on the Downs was naturally a subject for talk
Though the villagers were extremely frightened they were rather proud as well
It was a distinction to have a dragon of your own and it was felt to be a feather in the cap of the village
Still all were agreed that this sort of thing couldnt be allowed to go on
The dreadful beast must be exterminated the countryside must be freed from this pest this terror this destroying scourge
The fact that not even a hen roost was the worse for the dragons arrival wasnt allowed to have anything to do with it
He was a dragon and he couldnt deny it and if he didnt choose to behave as such that was his own lookout
But in spite of much valiant talk no hero was found willing to take sword and spear and free the suffering village and win deathless fame and each nights heated discussion always ended in nothing
Meanwhile the dragon a happy Bohemian lolled on the turf enjoyed the sunsets told antediluvian anecdotes to the Boy and polished his old verses while meditating on fresh ones
One day the Boy on walking in to the village found everything wearing a festal appearance which was not to be accounted for in the calendar
Carpets and gaycoloured stuffs were hung out of the windows the churchbells clamoured noisily the little street was flowerstrewn and the whole population jostled each other along either side of it chattering shoving and ordering each other to stand back
The Boy saw a friend of his own age in the crowd and hailed him
Whats up
he cried
Is it the players or bears or a circus or what
Its all right his friend hailed back
Hes acoming
WHOS acoming
demanded the Boy thrusting into the throng
Why St George of course replied his friend
Hes heard tell of our dragon and hes comin on purpose to slay the deadly beast and free us from his horrid yoke
O my
wont there be a jolly fight
Here was news indeed
The Boy felt that he ought to make quite sure for himself and he wriggled himself in between the legs of his goodnatured elders abusing them all the time for their unmannerly habit of shoving
Once in the front rank he breathlessly awaited the arrival
Presently from the faraway end of the line came the sound of cheering
Next the measured tramp of a great warhorse made his heart beat quicker and then he found himself cheering with the rest as amidst welcoming shouts shrill cries of women uplifting of babies and waving of handkerchiefs St George paced slowly up the street
The Boys heart stood still and he breathed with sobs the beauty and the grace of the hero were so far beyond anything he had yet seen
His fluted armour was inlaid with gold his plumed helmet hung at his saddlebow and his thick fair hair framed a face gracious and gentle beyond expression till you caught the sternness in his eyes
He drew rein in front of the little inn and the villagers crowded round with greetings and thanks and voluble statements of their wrongs and grievances and oppressions
The Boy heard the grave gentle voice of the Saint assuring them that all would be well now and that he would stand by them and see them righted and free them from their foe then he dismounted and passed through the doorway and the crowd poured in after him
But the Boy made off up the hill as fast as he could lay his legs to the ground
Its all up dragon
he shouted as soon as he was within sight of the beast
Hes coming
Hes here now
Youll have to pull yourself together and DO something at last
The dragon was licking his scales and rubbing them with a bit of houseflannel the Boys mother had lent him till he shone like a great turquoise
Dont be VIOLENT Boy he said without looking round
Sit down and get your breath and try and remember that the noun governs the verb and then perhaps youll be good enough to tell me WHOS coming
Thats right take it coolly said the Boy
Hope youll be half as cool when Ive got through with my news
Its only St George whos coming thats all he rode into the village half anhour ago
Of course you can lick hima great big fellow like you
But I thought Id warn you cos hes sure to be round early and hes got the longest wickedestlooking spear you ever did see
And the Boy got up and began to jump round in sheer delight at the prospect of the battle
O deary deary me moaned the dragon this is too awful
I wont see him and thats flat
I dont want to know the fellow at all
Im sure hes not nice
You must tell him to go away at once please
Say he can write if he likes but I cant give him an interview
Im not seeing anybody at present
Now dragon dragon said the Boy imploringly dont be perverse and wrongheaded
Youve GOT to fight him some time or other you know cos hes St George and youre the dragon
Better get it over and then we can go on with the sonnets
And you ought to consider other people a little too
If its been dull up here for you think how dull its been for me
My dear little man said the dragon solemnly just understand once for all that I cant fight and I wont fight
Ive never fought in my life and Im not going to begin now just to give you a Roman holiday
In old days I always let the other fellowsthe EARNEST fellowsdo all the fighting and no doubt thats why I have the pleasure of being here now
But if you dont fight hell cut your head off
gasped the Boy miserable at the prospect of losing both his fight and his friend
Oh I think not said the dragon in his lazy way
Youll be able to arrange something
Ive every confidence in you youre such a MANAGER
Just run down theres a dear chap and make it all right
I leave it entirely to you
The Boy made his way back to the village in a state of great despondency
First of all there wasnt going to be any fight next his dear and honoured friend the dragon hadnt shown up in quite such a heroic light as he would have liked and lastly whether the dragon was a hero at heart or not it made no difference for St George would most undoubtedly cut his head off
Arrange things indeed
he said bitterly to himself
The dragon treats the whole affair as if it was an invitation to tea and croquet
The villagers were straggling homewards as he passed up the street all of them in the highest spirits and gleefully discussing the splendid fight that was in store
The Boy pursued his way to the inn and passed into the principal chamber where St George now sat alone musing over the chances of the fight and the sad stories of rapine and of wrong that had so lately been poured into his sympathetic ears
May I come in St
George
said the Boy politely as he paused at the door
I want to talk to you about this little matter of the dragon if youre not tired of it by this time
Yes come in Boy said the Saint kindly
Another tale of misery and wrong I fear me
Is it a kind parent then of whom the tyrant has bereft you
Or some tender sister or brother
Well it shall soon be avenged
Nothing of the sort said the Boy
Theres a misunderstanding somewhere and I want to put it right
The fact is this is a GOOD dragon
Exactly said St George smiling pleasantly I quite understand
A good DRAGON
Believe me I do not in the least regret that he is an adversary worthy of my steel and no feeble specimen of his noxious tribe
But hes NOT a noxious tribe cried the Boy distressedly
Oh dear oh dear how STUPID men are when they get an idea into their heads
I tell you hes a GOOD dragon and a friend of mine and tells me the most beautiful stories you ever heard all about old times and when he was little
And hes been so kind to mother and motherd do anything for him
And father likes him too though father doesnt hold with art and poetry much and always falls asleep when the dragon starts talking about STYLE
But the fact is nobody can help liking him when once they know him
Hes so engaging and so trustful and as simple as a child
Sit down and draw your chair up said St George
I like a fellow who sticks up for his friends and Im sure the dragon has his good points if hes got a friend like you
But thats not the question
All this evening Ive been listening with grief and anguish unspeakable to tales of murder theft and wrong rather too highly coloured perhaps not always quite convincing but forming in the main a most serious roll of crime
History teaches us that the greatest rascals often possess all the domestic virtues and I fear that your cultivated friend in spite of the qualities which have won and rightly your regard has got to be speedily exterminated
Oh youve been taking in all the yarns those fellows have been telling you said the Boy impatiently
Why our villagers are the biggest storytellers in all the country round
Its a known fact
Youre a stranger in these parts or else youd have heard it already
All they want is a FIGHT
Theyre the most awful beggars for getting up fightsits meat and drink to them
Dogs bulls dragonsanything so long as its a fight
Why theyve got a poor innocent badger in the stable behind here at this moment
They were going to have some fun with him today but theyre saving him up now till YOUR little affairs over
And Ive no doubt theyve been telling you what a hero you were and how you were bound to win in the cause of right and justice and so on but let me tell you I came down the street just now and they were betting six to four on the dragon freely
Six to four on the dragon
murmured St George sadly resting his cheek on his hand
This is an evil world and sometimes I begin to think that all the wickedness in it is not entirely bottled up inside the dragons
And yetmay not this wily beast have misled you as to his real character in order that your good report of him may serve as a cloak for his evil deeds
Nay may there not be at this very moment some hapless Princess immured within yonder gloomy cavern
The moment he had spoken St George was sorry for what he had said the Boy looked so genuinely distressed
I assure you St George he said earnestly theres nothing of the sort in the cave at all
The dragons a real gentleman every inch of him and I may say that no one would be more shocked and grieved than he would at hearing you talk in that that LOOSE way about matters on which he has very strong views
Well perhaps Ive been overcredulous said St George
Perhaps Ive misjudged the animal
But what are we to do
Here are the dragon and I almost face to face each supposed to be thirsting for each others blood
I dont see any way out of it exactly
What do you suggest
Cant you arrange things somehow
Thats just what the dragon said replied the Boy rather nettled
Really the way you two seem to leave everything to meI suppose you couldnt be persuaded to go away quietly could you
Impossible I fear said the Saint
Quite against the rules
YOU know that as well as I do
Well then look here said the Boy its early yetwould you mind strolling up with me and seeing the dragon and talking it over
Its not far and any friend of mine will be most welcome
Well its IRREGULAR said St George rising but really it seems about the most sensible thing to do
Youre taking a lot of trouble on your friends account he added goodnaturedly as they passed out through the door together
But cheer up
Perhaps there wont have to be any fight after all
Oh but I hope there will though
replied the little fellow wistfully
Ive brought a friend to see you dragon said the Boy rather loud
The dragon woke up with a start
I was justerthinking about things he said in his simple way
Very pleased to make your acquaintance sir
Charming weather were having
This is St George said the Boy shortly
St George let me introduce you to the dragon
Weve come up to talk things over quietly dragon and now for goodness sake do let us have a little straight commonsense and come to some practical businesslike arrangement for Im sick of views and theories of life and personal tendencies and all that sort of thing
I may perhaps add that my mothers sitting up
So glad to meet you St George began the dragon rather nervously because youve been a great traveller I hear and Ive always been rather a stayathome
But I can show you many antiquities many interesting features of our countryside if youre stopping here any time I think said St George in his frank pleasant way that wed really better take the advice of our young friend here and try to come to some understanding on a business footing about this little affair of ours
Now dont you think that after all the simplest plan would be just to fight it out according to the rules and let the best man win
Theyre betting on you I may tell you down in the village but I dont mind that
Oh yes DO dragon said the Boy delightedly itll save such a lot of bother
My young friend you shut up said the dragon severely
Believe me St George he went on theres nobody in the world Id sooner oblige than you and this young gentleman here
But the whole things nonsense and conventionality and popular thickheadedness
Theres absolutely nothing to fight about from beginning to end
And anyhow Im not going to so that settles it
But supposing I make you
said St George rather nettled
You cant said the dragon triumphantly
I should only go into my cave and retire for a time down the hole I came up
Youd soon get heartily sick of sitting outside and waiting for me to come out and fight you
And as soon as youd really gone away why Id come up again gaily for I tell you frankly I like this place and Im going to stay here
St George gazed for a while on the fair landscape around them
But this would be a beautiful place for a fight he began again persuasively
These great bare rolling Downs for the arena and me in my golden armour showing up against your big blue scaly coils
Think what a picture it would make
Now youre trying to get at me through my artistic sensibilities said the dragon
But it wont work
Not but what it would make a very pretty picture as you say he added wavering a little
We seem to be getting rather nearer to BUSINESS put in the Boy
You must see dragon that theres got to be a fight of some sort cos you cant want to have to go down that dirty old hole again and stop there till goodness knows when
It might be arranged said St George thoughtfully
I MUST spear you somewhere of course but Im not bound to hurt you very much
Theres such a lot of you that there must be a few SPARE places somewhere
Here for instance just behind your foreleg
It couldnt hurt you much just here
Now youre tickling George said the dragon coyly
No that place wont do at all
Even if it didnt hurtand Im sure it would awfullyit would make me laugh and that would spoil everything
Lets try somewhere else then said St George patiently
Under your neck for instanceall these folds of thick skin if I speared you here youd never even know Id done it
Yes but are you sure you can hit off the right place
asked the dragon anxiously
Of course I am said St George with confidence
You leave that to me
Its just because Ive GOT to leave it to you that Im asking replied the dragon rather testily
No doubt you would deeply regret any error you might make in the hurry of the moment but you wouldnt regret it half as much as I should
However I suppose weve got to trust somebody as we go through life and your plan seems on the whole as good a one as any
Look here dragon interrupted the Boy a little jealous on behalf of his friend who seemed to be getting all the worst of the bargain I dont quite see where YOU come in
Theres to be a fight apparently and youre to be licked and what I want to know is what are YOU going to get out of it
St George said the dragon Just tell him pleasewhat will happen after Im vanquished in the deadly combat
Well according to the rules I suppose I shall lead you in triumph down to the marketplace or whatever answers to it said St George
Precisely said the dragon
And then And then therell be shoutings and speeches and things continued St George
And I shall explain that youre converted and see the error of your ways and so on
Quite so said the dragon
And then
Oh and then said St George why and then there will be the usual banquet I suppose
Exactly said the dragon and thats where I come in
Look here he continued addressing the Boy Im bored to death up here and no one really appreciates me
Im going into Society I am through the kindly aid of our friend here whos taking such a lot of trouble on my account and youll find Ive got all the qualities to endear me to people who entertain
So now thats all settled and if you dont mindIm an old fashioned fellowdont want to turn you out but Remember youll have to do your proper share of the fighting dragon
said St George as he took the hint and rose to go I mean ramping and breathing fire and so on
I can RAMP all right replied the dragon confidently as to breathing fire its surprising how easily one gets out of practice but Ill do the best I can
Goodnight
They had descended the hill and were almost back in the village again when St George stopped short KNEW I had forgotten something he said
There ought to be a Princess
Terrorstricken and chained to a rock and all that sort of thing
Boy cant you arrange a Princess
The Boy was in the middle of a tremendous yawn
Im tired to death he wailed and I CANT arrange a Princess or anything more at this time of night
And my mothers sitting up and DO stop asking me to arrange more things till tomorrow
Next morning the people began streaming up to the Downs at quite an early hour in their Sunday clothes and carrying baskets with bottlenecks sticking out of them every one intent on securing good places for the combat
This was not exactly a simple matter for of course it was quite possible that the dragon might win and in that case even those who had put their money on him felt they could hardly expect him to deal with his backers on a different footing to the rest
Places were chosen therefore with circumspection and with a view to a speedy retreat in case of emergency and the front rank was mostly composed of boys who had escaped from parental control and now sprawled and rolled about on the grass regardless of the shrill threats and warnings discharged at them by their anxious mothers behind
The Boy had secured a good front place well up towards the cave and was feeling as anxious as a stagemanager on a first night
Could the dragon be depended upon
He might change his mind and vote the whole performance rot or else seeing that the affair had been so hastily planned without even a rehearsal he might be too nervous to show up
The Boy looked narrowly at the cave but it showed no sign of life or occupation
Could the dragon have made a moonlight flitting
The higher portions of the ground were now black with sightseers and presently a sound of cheering and a waving of handkerchiefs told that something was visible to them which the Boy far up towards the dragonend of the line as he was could not yet see
A minute more and St Georges red plumes topped the hill as the Saint rode slowly forth on the great level space which stretched up to the grim mouth of the cave
Very gallant and beautiful he looked on his tall warhorse his golden armour glancing in the sun his great spear held erect the little white pennon crimsoncrossed fluttering at its point
He drew rein and remained motionless
The lines of spectators began to give back a little nervously and even the boys in front stopped pulling hair and cuffing each other and leaned forward expectant
Now then dragon
muttered the Boy impatiently fidgeting where he sat
He need not have distressed himself had he only known
The dramatic possibilities of the thing had tickled the dragon immensely and he had been up from an early hour preparing for his first public appearance with as much heartiness as if the years had run backwards and he had been again a little dragonlet playing with his sisters on the floor of their mothers cave at the game of saintsanddragons in which the dragon was bound to win
A low muttering mingled with snorts now made itself heard rising to a bellowing roar that seemed to fill the plain
Then a cloud of smoke obscured the mouth of the cave and out of the midst of it the dragon himself shining seablue magnificent pranced splendidly forth and everybody said Oooooo
as if he had been a mighty rocket
His scales were glittering his long spiky tail lashed his sides his claws tore up the turf and sent it flying high over his back and smoke and fire incessantly jetted from his angry nostrils
Oh well done dragon
cried the Boy excitedly
Didnt think he had it in him
he added to himself
St George lowered his spear bent his head dug his heels into his horses sides and came thundering over the turf
The dragon charged with a roar and a squeala great blue whirling combination of coils and snorts and clashing jaws and spikes and fire
Missed
yelled the crowd
There was a moments entanglement of golden armour and bluegreen coils and spiky tail and then the great horse tearing at his bit carried the Saint his spear swung high in the air almost up to the mouth of the cave
The dragon sat down and barked viciously while St George with difficulty pulled his horse round into position
End of Round One
thought the Boy
How well they managed it
But I hope the Saint wont get excited
I can trust the dragon all right
What a regular playactor the fellow is
St George had at last prevailed on his horse to stand steady and was looking round him as he wiped his brow
Catching sight of the Boy he smiled and nodded and held up three fingers for an instant
It seems to be all planned out said the Boy to himself
Round Three is to be the finishing one evidently
Wish it could have lasted a bit longer
Whatevers that old fool of a dragon up to now
The dragon was employing the interval in giving a ramping performance for the benefit of the crowd
Ramping it should be explained consists in running round and round in a wide circle and sending waves and ripples of movement along the whole length of your spine from your pointed ears right down to the spike at the end of your long tail
When you are covered with blue scales the effect is particularly pleasing and the Boy recollected the dragons recently expressed wish to become a social success
St George now gathered up his reins and began to move forward dropping the point of his spear and settling himself firmly in the saddle
Time
yelled everybody excitedly and the dragon leaving off his ramping sat up on end and began to leap from one side to the other with huge ungainly bounds whooping like a Red Indian
This naturally disconcerted the horse who swerved violently the Saint only just saving himself by the mane and as they shot past the dragon delivered a vicious snap at the horses tail which sent the poor beast careering madly far over the Downs so that the language of the Saint who had lost a stirrup was fortunately inaudible to the general assemblage
Round Two evoked audible evidence of friendly feeling towards the dragon
The spectators were not slow to appreciate a combatant who could hold his own so well and clearly wanted to show good sport and many encouraging remarks reached the ears of our friend as he strutted to and fro his chest thrust out and his tail in the air hugely enjoying his new popularity
St George had dismounted and was tightening his girths and telling his horse with quite an Oriental flow of imagery exactly what he thought of him and his relations and his conduct on the present occasion so the Boy made his way down to the Saints end of the line and held his spear for him
Its been a jolly fight St
George
he said with a sigh
Cant you let it last a bit longer
Well I think Id better not replied the Saint
The fact is your simpleminded old friends getting conceited now theyve begun cheering him and hell forget all about the arrangement and take to playing the fool and theres no telling where he would stop
Ill just finish him off this round
He swung himself into the saddle and took his spear from the Boy
Now dont you be afraid he added kindly
Ive marked my spot exactly and HES sure to give me all the assistance in his power because he knows its his only chance of being asked to the banquet
St George now shortened his spear bringing the butt well up under his arm and instead of galloping as before trotted smartly towards the dragon who crouched at his approach flicking his tail till it cracked in the air like a great cart whip
The Saint wheeled as he neared his opponent and circled warily round him keeping his eye on the spare place while the dragon adopting similar tactics paced with caution round the same circle occasionally feinting with his head
So the two sparred for an opening while the spectators maintained a breathless silence
Though the round lasted for some minutes the end was so swift that all the Boy saw was a lightning movement of the Saints arm and then a whirl and a confusion of spines claws tail and flying bits of turf
The dust cleared away the spectators whooped and ran in cheering and the Boy made out that the dragon was down pinned to the earth by the spear while St George had dismounted and stood astride of him
It all seemed so genuine that the Boy ran in breathlessly hoping the dear old dragon wasnt really hurt
As he approached the dragon lifted one large eyelid winked solemnly and collapsed again
He was held fast to earth by the neck but the Saint had hit him in the spare place agreed upon and it didnt even seem to tickle
Baint you goin to cut is ed orf master
asked one of the applauding crowd
He had backed the dragon and naturally felt a trifle sore
Well not TODAY I think replied St George pleasantly
You see that can be done at ANY time
Theres no hurry at all
I think well all go down to the village first and have some refreshment and then Ill give him a good talkingto and youll find hell be a very different dragon
At that magic word REFRESHMENT the whole crowd formed up in procession and silently awaited the signal to start
The time for talking and cheering and betting was past the hour for action had arrived
St George hauling on his spear with both hands released the dragon who rose and shook himself and ran his eye over his spikes and scales and things to see that they were all in order
Then the Saint mounted and led off the procession the dragon following meekly in the company of the Boy while the thirsty spectators kept at a respectful interval behind
There were great doings when they got down to the village again and had formed up in front of the inn
After refreshment St George made a speech in which he informed his audience that he had removed their direful scourge at a great deal of trouble and inconvenience to himself and now they werent to go about grumbling and fancying theyd got grievances because they hadnt
And they shouldnt be so fond of fights because next time they might have to do the fighting themselves which would not be the same thing at all
And there was a certain badger in the inn stables which had got to be released at once and hed come and see it done himself
Then he told them that the dragon had been thinking over things and saw that there were two sides to every question and he wasnt going to do it any more and if they were good perhaps hed stay and settle down there
So they must make friends and not be prejudiced and go about fancying they knew everything there was to be known because they didnt not by a long way
And he warned them against the sin of romancing and making up stories and fancying other people would believe them just because they were plausible and highly coloured
Then he sat down amidst much repentant cheering and the dragon nudged the Boy in the ribs and whispered that he couldnt have done it better himself
Then every one went off to get ready for the banquet
Banquets are always pleasant things consisting mostly as they do of eating and drinking but the specially nice thing about a banquet is that it comes when somethings over and theres nothing more to worry about and tomorrow seems a long way off
St George was happy because there had been a fight and he hadnt had to kill anybody for he didnt really like killing though he generally had to do it
The dragon was happy because there had been a fight and so far from being hurt in it he had won popularity and a sure footing in society
The Boy was happy because there had been a fight and in spite of it all his two friends were on the best of terms
And all the others were happy because there had been a fight andwell they didnt require any other reasons for their happiness
The dragon exerted himself to say the right thing to everybody and proved the life and soul of the evening while the Saint and the Boy as they looked on felt that they were only assisting at a feast of which the honour and the glory were entirely the dragons
But they didnt mind that being good fellows and the dragon was not in the least proud or forgetful
On the contrary every ten minutes or so he leant over towards the Boy and said impressively Look here
you WILL see me home afterwards wont you
And the Boy always nodded though he had promised his mother not to be out late
At last the banquet was over the guests had dropped away with many goodnights and congratulations and invitations and the dragon who had seen the last of them off the premises emerged into the street followed by the Boy wiped his brow sighed sat down in the road and gazed at the stars
Jolly night its been
he murmured
Jolly stars
Jolly little place this
Think I shall just stop here
Dont feel like climbing up any beastly hill
Boys promised to see me home
Boy had better do it then
No responsibility on my part
Responsibility all Boys
And his chin sank on his broad chest and he slumbered peacefully
Oh GET up dragon cried the Boy piteously
You KNEW my mothers sitting up and Im so tired and you made me promise to see you home and I never knew what it meant or I wouldnt have done it
And the Boy sat down in the road by the side of the sleeping dragon and cried
The door behind them opened a stream of light illumined the road and St George who had come out for a stroll in the cool nightair caught sight of the two figures sitting therethe great motionless dragon and the tearful little Boy
Whats the matter Boy
he inquired kindly stepping to his side
Oh its this great lumbering PIG of a dragon
sobbed the Boy
First he makes me promise to see him home and then he says Id better do it and goes to sleep
Might as well try to see a HAYSTACK home
And Im so tired and mothers here he broke down again
Now dont take on said St George
Ill stand by you and well BOTH see him home
Wake up dragon
he said sharply shaking the beast by the elbow
The dragon looked up sleepily
What a night George
he murmured what a Now look here dragon said the Saint firmly
Heres this little fellow waiting to see you home and you KNOW he ought to have been in bed these two hours and what his motherll say I dont know and anybody but a selfish pig would have MADE him go to bed long ago And he SHALL go to bed
cried the dragon starting up
Poor little chap only fancy his being up at this hour
Its a shame thats what it is and I dont think St George youve been very consideratebut come along at once and dont let us have any more arguing or shillyshallying
You give me hold of your hand Boythank you George an arm up the hill is just what I wanted
So they set off up the hill arminarm the Saint the Dragon and the Boy
The lights in the little village began to go out but there were stars and a late moon as they climbed to the Downs together
And as they turned the last corner and disappeared from view snatches of an old song were borne back on the nightbreeze
I cant be certain which of them was singing but I THINK it was the Dragon
Here we are at your gate said the man abruptly laying his hand on it
Goodnight
Cut along in sharp or youll catch it
Could it really be our own gate
Yes there it was sure enough with the familiar marks on its bottom bar made by our feet when we swung on it
Oh but wait a minute
cried Charlotte
I want to know a heap of things
Did the dragon really settle down
And did There isnt any more of that story said the man kindly but firmly
At least not tonight
Now be off
Goodbye
Wonder if its all true
said Charlotte as we hurried up the path
Sounded dreadfully like nonsense in parts
Praps its true for all that I replied encouragingly
Charlotte bolted in like a rabbit out of the cold and the dark but I lingered a moment in the still frosty air for a backward glance at the silent white world without ere I changed it for the land of firelight and cushions and laughter
It was the day for choirpractice and caroltime was at hand and a belated member was passing homewards down the road singing as he went Then St George ee made revrence in the stable so dim Oo vanquished the dragon so fearful and grim
Soo grim and soo fierce that now may we say All peaceful is our wakin on Chriistmas Day
The singer receded the carol died away
But I wondered with my hand on the doorlatch whether that was the song or something like it that the dragon sang as he toddled contentedly up the hill
A DEPARTURE It is a very fine thing to be a real Prince
There are points about a Pirate Chief and to succeed to the Captaincy of a Robber Band is a truly magnificent thing
But to be an Heir has also about it something extremely captivating
Not only a longlost heiran heir of the melodrama strutting into your hitherto unsuspected kingdom at just the right moment loaded up with the consciousness of unguessed merit and of rights so long feloniously withheldbut even to be a common humdrum domestic heir is a profession to which few would refuse to be apprenticed
To step from leadingstrings and restrictions and one glass of port after dinner into property and liberty and due appreciation saved up polished and varnished dusted and laid in lavender all expressly for youwhy even the Princedom and the Robber Captaincy when their anxieties and responsibilities are considered have hardly more to offer
And so it will continue to be a problem to the youth in whom ambition struggles with a certain sensuous appreciation of lifes sidedishes whether the career he is called upon to select out of the glittering knickknacks that strew the counter had better be that of an heir or an enginedriver
In the case of eldest sons this problem has a way of solving itself
In childhood however the actual heirship is apt to work on the principle of the BoroughEnglish of our happier ancestors and in most cases of inheritance it is the youngest that succeeds
Where the res is angusta and the weekly books are simply a series of stiff hurdles at each of which in succession the paternal legs falter with growing suspicion of their powers to clear the flight it is in the affair of CLOTHES that the right of succession tells and the hard heir strides about the land in trousers long ago framed for fraternal limbsfrondes novas et non sua poma
A bitter thing indeed
Of those pretty silken threads that knit humanity together high and low past and present none is tougher more pervading or more iridescent than the honest simple pleasure of new clothes
It tugs at the man as it tugs at the woman the smirk of the wellfitted prince is no different from the smirk of the Sunday clad peasant and the veins of the elders tingle with the same thrill that sets their freshfrocked grandchildren skipping
Never trust people who pretend that they have no joy in their new clothes
Let not our souls be wrung however at contemplation of the luckless urchin cut off by parental penury from the rapture of new clothes
Just as the heroes of his dreams are his immediate seniors so his heroes clothes share the glamour and the reversion of them carries a high privilegea special thing not sold by Swears and Wells
The sword of Galahadand of many another heroarrived on the scene already hoary with history and the boy rather prefers his trousers to be legendary famous haloed by his heros renowneven though the nap may have altogether vanished in the process
But putting clothes aside there are other matters in which this reversed heirship comes into play
Take the case of Toys
It is hardly right or fittingand in this the child quite acquiesces that as he approaches the reverend period of nine or say ten years he should still be the unabashed and proclaimed possessor of a hoop and a Noahs Ark
The child will quite see the reasonableness of this and the goal of his ambition being now a catapult a pistol or even a swordstick will be satisfied that the titular ownership should lapse to his juniors so far below him in their kilted or petticoated incompetence
After all the things are still there and if relapses of spirit occur on wet afternoons one can still nominally borrow them and be happy on the floor as of old without the reproach of being a habitual baby toycaresser
Also one can pretend its being done to amuse the younger ones
None of us therefore grumbled when in the natural course of things the nominal ownership of the toys slipped down to Harold and from him in turn devolved upon Charlotte
The toys were still there they always had been there and always would be there and when the nursery door was fast shut there were no Kings or Queens or First Estates in that small Republic on the floor
Charlotte to be sure chintilted at last an owner of real estate might patronize a little at times but it was tacitly understood that her title  was only a drawingroom one
Why does a coming bereavement project no thin faint voice no shadow of its woe to warn its happy heedless victims
Why cannot Olympians ever think it worth while to give some hint of the thunderbolts they are silently forging
And why oh why did it never enter any of our thick heads that the day would come when even Charlotte would be considered too matronly for toys
Ones socalled education is hammered into one with rulers and with canes
Each fresh grammar or musical instrument each new historical period or quaint arithmetical rule is impressed on one by some painful physical prelude
Why does Time the biggest Schoolmaster alone neglect premonitory raps at each stage of his curriculum on our knuckles or our heads
Uncle Thomas was at the bottom of it
This was not the first mine he had exploded under our bows
In his favourite pursuit of fads he had passed in turn from Psychical Research to the White Rose and thence to a Childrens Hospital and we were being daily inundated with leaflets headed by a woodcut depicting Little Annie of Poplar sitting up in her little white cot surrounded by the toys of the nice kind rich children
The idea caught on with the Olympians always open to sentiment of a treacly woodcut order and accordingly Charlotte on entering one day dishevelled and panting having been pursued by yelling Redskins up to the very threshold of our peaceful home was curtly informed that her French lessons would begin on Monday that she was henceforth to cease all pretence of being a trapper or a Redskin on utterly inadequate grounds and moreover that the whole of her toys were at that moment being finally packed up in a box for despatch to London to gladden the lives and bring light into the eyes of London waifs and Poplar Annies
Naturally enough perhaps we others received no official intimation of this grave cession of territory
We were not supposed to be interested
Harold had long ago been promoted to a knifea recognized birthday knife
As for me it was known that I was already given over heart and soul to lawless abandoned catapultscatapults which were confiscated weekly for reasons of international complications but with which Edward kept me steadily supplied his school having a fine old tradition for excellence in their manufacture
Therefore no one was supposed to be really affected but Charlotte and even she had already reached Miss Yonge and should therefore have been more interested in prolific curates and harrowing deathbeds
Nothwithstanding we all felt indignant betrayed and sullen to the verge of mutiny
Though for long we had affected to despise them these toys yet they had grown up with us shared our joys and our sorrows seen us at our worst and become part of the accepted scheme of existence
As we gazed at untenanted shelves and empty hatefully tidy corners perhaps for the first time for long we began to do them a tardy justice
There was old Leotard for instance
Somehow he had come to be sadly neglected of late yearsand yet how exactly he always responded to certain moods
He was an acrobat this Leotard who lived in a glassfronted box
His loosejointed limbs were cardboard cardboard his slender trunk and his hands eternally grasped the bar of a trapeze
You turned the box round swiftly five or six times the wonderful unsolved machinery worked and Leotard swung and leapt backwards forwards now astride the bar now flying free ironjointed supplesinewed unceasingly novel in his invention of new unguessable attitudes while above below and around him a richlydressed audience painted in skilful perspective of stalls boxes dresscircle and gallery watched the thrilling performance with a stolidity which seemed to mark them out as made in Germany
Hardly versatile enough perhaps this Leotard unsympathetic not a companion for all hours nor would you have chosen him to take to bed with you
And yet within his own limits how fresh how engrossing how resourceful and inventive
Well he was gone it seemed merely gone
Never specially cherished while he tarried with us he had yet contrived to build himself a particular niche of his own
Sunrise and sunset and the dinnerbell and the sudden rainbow and lessons and Leotard and the moon through the nursery windowsthey were all part of the great order of things and the displacement of any one item seemed to disorganize the whole machinery
The immediate point was not that the world would continue to go round as of old but that Leotard wouldnt
Yonder corner now swept and garnished had been the stall wherein the spotty horse at the close of each laborious day was accustomed to doze peacefully the long night through
In days of old each of us in turn had been jerked thrillingly round the room on his precarious back had dug our heels into his unyielding sides and had scratched our hands on the tin tacks that secured his mane to his stifflycurving neck
Later with increasing stature we came to overlook his merits as a beast of burden but how frankly how goodnaturedly he had recognized the new conditions and adapted himself to them without a murmur
When the military spirit was abroad who so ready to be a squadron of cavalry a horde of Cossacks or artillery pounding into position
He had even served with honour as a gunboat during a period when naval strategy was the only theme and no false equine pride ever hindered him from taking the part of a roaring locomotive earthshaking clangorous annihilating time and space
Really it was no longer clear how life with its manifold emergencies was to be carried on at all without a fellow like the spotty horse ready to step in at critical moments and take up just the part required of him
In moments of mental depression nothing is quite so consoling as the honest smell of a painted animal and mechanically I turned towards the shelf that had been so long the Ararat of our weatherbeaten Ark
The shelf was empty the Ark had cast off moorings and sailed away to Poplar and had taken with it its haunting smell as well as that pleasant sense of disorder that the best conducted Ark is always able to impart
The sliding roof had rarely been known to close entirely
There was always a pair of giraffelegs sticking out or an elephant trunk taking from the stiffness of its outline and reminding us that our motley crowd of friends inside were uncomfortably cramped for room and only too ready to leap in a cascade on the floor and browse and gallop flutter and bellow and neigh and be their natural selves again
I think that none of us ever really thought very much of Ham and Shem and Japhet
They were only there because they were in the story but nobody really wanted them
The Ark was built for the animals of course animals with tails and trunks and horns and at least three legs apiece though some unfortunates had been unable to retain even that number
And in the animals were of course included the birdsthe dove for instance grey with black wings and the redcrested woodpeckeror was it a hoopoeand the insects for there was a dear beetle about the same size as the dove that held its own with any of the mammalia
Of the dolldepartment Charlotte had naturally been sole chief for a long time if the staff were not in their places today it was not I who had any official right to take notice
And yet one may have been member of a Club for many a year without ever exactly understanding the use and object of the other members until one enters some Christmas day or other holiday and surveying the deserted armchairs the untenanted sofas the barren hatpegs realizes with depression that those other fellows had their allotted functions after all
Where was old Jerry
Where were Eugenie Rosa Sophy Esmeralda
We had long drifted apart it was true we spoke but rarely perhaps absorbed in new ambitions new achievements I had even come to look down on these conservative unprogressive members who were so clearly content to remain simply what they were
And now that their corners were unfilled their chairs unoccupiedwell my eyes were opened and I wanted em back
However it was no business of mine
If grievances were the question I hadnt a leg to stand upon
Though my catapults were officially confiscated I knew the drawer in which they were incarcerated and where the key of it was hidden and I could make life a burden if I chose to every living thing within a squaremile radius so long as the catapult was restored to its drawer in due and decent time
But I wondered how the others were taking it
The edict hit them more severely
They should have my moral countenance at any rate if not more in any protest or countermine they might be planning
And indeed something seemed possible from the dogged sullen air with which the two of them had trotted off in the direction of the raspberrycanes
Certain spots always had their insensible attraction for certain moods
In love one sought the orchard
Weary of discipline sick of convention impassioned for the road the mining camp the land across the border one made for the big meadow
Mutinous sulky charged with plots and conspiracies one always got behind the shelter of the raspberrycanes







You can come too if you like said Harold in a subdued sort of way as soon as he was aware that I was sitting up in bed watching him
We didnt think youd care cos youve got to catapults
But were goin to do what weve settled to do so its no good sayin we hadnt ought and that sort of thing cos were goin to
The day had passed in an ominous peacefulness
Charlotte and Harold had kept out of my way as well as out of everybody elses in a purposeful manner that ought to have bred suspicion
In the evening we had read books or fitfully drawn ships and battles on flyleaves apart in separate corners void of conversation or criticism oppressed by the lowering tidiness of the universe till bedtime came and disrobement and prayers even more mechanical than usual and lastly bed itself without so much as a giraffe under the pillow
Harold had grunted himself between the sheets with an ostentatious pretence of overpowering fatigue but I noticed that he pulled his pillow forward and propped his head against the brass bars of his crib and as I was acquainted with most of his tricks and subterfuges it was easy for me to gather that a painful wakefulness was his aim that night
I had dozed off however and Harold was out and on his feet poking under the bed for his shoes when I sat up and grimly regarded him
Just as he said I could come if I liked Charlotte slipped in her face rigid and set
And then it was borne in upon me that I was not on in this scene
These youngsters had planned it all out the piece was their own and the mounting and the cast
My sceptre had fallen my rule had ceased
In this magic hour of the summer night laws went for nothing codes were cancelled and those who were most in touch with the moonlight and the warm June spirit and the topsy turvydom that reigns when the clock strikes ten were the true lords and lawmakers
Humbly almost timidly I followed without a protest in the wake of these two remorseless purposeful young persons who were marching straight for the schoolroom
Here in the moonlight the grim big box stood visiblethe box in which so large a portion of our past and our personality lay entombed cold swathed in paper awaiting the carrier of the morning who should speed them forth to the strange cold distant Childrens Hospital where their little failings would all be misunderstood and no one would make allowances
A dreamy spectator I stood idly by while Harold propped up the lid and the two plunged in their arms and probed and felt and grappled
Heres Rosa said Harold suddenly
I know the feel of her hair
Will you have Rosa out
Oh give me Rosa
cried Charlotte with a sort of gasp
And when Rosa had been dragged forth quite unmoved apparently placid as ever in her moonfaced contemplation of this comedy world with its ups and downs Charlotte retired with her to the windowseat and there in the moonlight the two exchanged their private confidences leaving Harold to his exploration alone
Heres something with sharp corners said Harold presently
Must be Leotard I think
Better let HIM go
Oh yes we cant save Leotard assented Charlotte limply
Poor old Leotard
I said nothing of course I was not on in this piece
But surely had Leotard heard and rightly understood all that was going on above him he must have sent up one feeble strangled cry one faint appeal to be rescued from unfamiliar little Annies and retained for an audience certain to appreciate and never unduly critical
Now Ive got to the Noahs Ark panted Harold still groping blindly
Try and shove the lid back a bit said Charlotte and pull out a dove or a zebra or a giraffe if theres one handy
Harold toiled on with grunts and contortions and presently produced in triumph a small grey elephant and a large beetle with a red stomach
Theyre jammed in too tight he complained
Cant get any more out
But as I came up Im sure I felt Potiphar
And down he dived again
Potiphar was a finely modelled bull with a suede skin rough and comfortable and warm in bed
He was my own special joy and pride and I thrilled with honest emotion when Potiphar emerged to light once more stoutnecked and stalwart as ever
Thatll have to do said Charlotte getting up
We dursnt take any more cos well be found out if we do
Make the box all right and bring em along
Harold rammed down the wads of paper and twists of straw he had disturbed replaced the lid squarely and innocently and picked up his small salvage and we sneaked off for the window most generally in use for prisonbreakings and nocturnal escapades
A few seconds later and we were hurrying silently in single file along the dark edge of the lawn
Oh the riot the clamour the crowding chorus of all silent things that spoke by scent and colour and budding thrust and foison that moonlit night of June
Under the laurelshade all was still ghostly enough brigandhaunted crackling whispering of night and all its possibilities of terror
But the open garden when once we were in ithow it turned a glad new face to welcome us glad as of old when the sunlight raked and searched it new with the unfamiliar nightaspect that yet welcomed us as guests to a hall where the horns blew up to a new strange banquet
Was this the same grass could these be the same familiar flowerbeds alleys clumps of verdure patches of sward
At least this full white light that was flooding them was new and accounted for all
It was Moonlight Land and PastTen oclock Land and we were in it and of it and all its other denizens fully understood and tonguefree and awakened at last responded and comprehended and knew
The other two doubtless hurrying forward full of their mission noted little of all this
I who was only a super had leisure to take it all in and though the language and the message of the land were not all clear to me then long afterwards I remembered and understood
Under the farthest hedge at the loose end of things where the outer world began with the paddock there was darkness once againnot the blackness that crouched so solidly under the crowding laurels but a duskiness hung from farspread arms of highstanding elms
There where the small grave made a darker spot on the grey I overtook them only just in time to see Rosa laid stiffly out her cherry cheeks pale in the moonlight but her brave smile triumphant and undaunted as ever
It was a tiny grave and a shallow one to hold so very much
Rosa once in Potiphar who had hitherto stood erect stoutnecked through so many days and such various weather must needs bow his head and lie down meekly on his side
The elephant and the beetle equal now in a silent land where a vertebra and a red circulation counted for nothing had to snuggle down where best they might only a little less crowded than in their native Ark
The earth was shovelled in and stamped down and I was glad that no orisons were said and no speechifying took place
The whole thing was natural and right and selfexplanatory and needed no justifying or interpreting to our audience of stars and flowers
The connexion was not entirely broken nowone link remained between us and them
The Noahs Ark with its cargo of sadfaced emigrants might be hull down on the horizon but two of its passengers had missed the boat and would henceforth be always near us and as we played above them an elephant would understand and a beetle would hear and crawl again in spirit along a familiar floor
Henceforth the spotty horse would scour along fardistant plains and know the homesickness of alien stables but Potiphar though never again would he paw the arena when bullfights were on the bill was spared maltreatment by townbred strangers quite capable of mistaking him for a cow
Jerry and Esmeralda might shed their limbs and their stuffing by slow or swift degrees in uttermost parts and unguessed corners of the globe but Rosas book was finally closed and no worse fate awaited her than natural dissolution almost within touch and hail of familiar faces and objects that had been friendly to her since first she opened her eyes on a world where she had never been treated as a stranger
As we turned to go the man in the moon tangled in elmboughs caught my eye for a moment and I thought that never had he looked so friendly
He was going to see after them it was evident for he was always there more or less and it was no trouble to him at all and he would tell them how things were still going up here and throw in a story or two of his own whenever they seemed a trifle dull
It made the going away rather easier to know one had left somebody behind on the spot a good fellow too cheery comforting with a fund of anecdote a man in whom one had every confidence
