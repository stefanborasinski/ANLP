JB PART I CHAPTER ONE The WicketGate I spent onethird of my journey looking out of the window of a firstclass carriage the next in a local motorcar following the course of a trout stream in a shallow valley and the last tramping over a ridge of downland through great beechwoods to my quarters for the night
In the first part I was in an infamous temper in the second I was worried and mystified but the cool twilight of the third stage calmed and heartened me and I reached the gates of Fosse Manor with a mighty appetite and a quiet mind
As we slipped up the Thames valley on the smooth Great Western line I had reflected ruefully on the thorns in the path of duty
For more than a year I had never been out of khaki except the months I spent in hospital
They gave me my battalion before the Somme and I came out of that weary battle after the first big September fighting with a crack in my head and a DSO
I had received a CB
for the Erzerum business so what with these and my Matabele and South African medals and the Legion of Honour I had a chest like the High Priests breastplate
I rejoined in January and got a brigade on the eve of Arras
There we had a star turn and took about as many prisoners as we put infantry over the top
After that we were hauled out for a month and subsequently planted in a bad bit on the Scarpe with a hint that we would soon be used for a big push
Then suddenly I was ordered home to report to the War Office and passed on by them to Bullivant and his merry men
So here I was sitting in a railway carriage in a grey tweed suit with a neat new suitcase on the rack labelled CB
The initials stood for Cornelius Brand for that was my name now
And an old boy in the corner was asking me questions and wondering audibly why I wasnt fighting while a young blood of a second lieutenant with a wound stripe was eyeing me with scorn
The old chap was one of the crossexamining type and after he had borrowed my matches he set to work to find out all about me
He was a tremendous fireeater and a bit of a pessimist about our slow progress in the west
I told him I came from South Africa and was a mining engineer
Been fighting with Botha
he asked
No I said
Im not the fighting kind
The second lieutenant screwed up his nose
Is there no conscription in South Africa
Thank God there isnt I said and the old fellow begged permission to tell me a lot of unpalatable things
I knew his kind and didnt give much for it
He was the sort who if he had been under fifty would have crawled on his belly to his tribunal to get exempted but being over age was able to pose as a patriot
But I didnt like the second lieutenants grin for he seemed a good class of lad
I looked steadily out of the window for the rest of the way and wasnt sorry when I got to my station
I had had the queerest interview with Bullivant and Macgillivray
They asked me first if I was willing to serve again in the old game and I said I was
I felt as bitter as sin for I had got fixed in the military groove and had made good there
Here was I  a brigadier and still under forty and with another year of the war there was no saying where I might end
I had started out without any ambition only a great wish to see the business finished
But now I had acquired a professional interest in the thing I had a nailing good brigade and I had got the hang of our new kind of war as well as any fellow from Sandhurst and Camberley
They were asking me to scrap all I had learned and start again in a new job
I had to agree for disciplines discipline but I could have knocked their heads together in my vexation
What was worse they wouldnt or couldnt tell me anything about what they wanted me for
It was the old game of running me in blinkers
They asked me to take it on trust and put myself unreservedly in their hands
I would get my instructions later they said
I asked if it was important
Bullivant narrowed his eyes
If it werent do you suppose we could have wrung an active brigadier out of the War Office
As it was it was like drawing teeth
Is it risky
was my next question
in the long run  damnably was the answer
And you cant tell me anything more
Nothing as yet
Youll get your instructions soon enough
You know both of us Hannay and you know we wouldnt waste the time of a good man on folly
We are going to ask you for something which will make a big call on your patriotism
It will be a difficult and arduous task and it may be a very grim one before you get to the end of it but we believe you can do it and that no one else can  You know us pretty well
Will you let us judge for you
I looked at Bullivants shrewd kind old face and Macgillivrays steady eyes
These men were my friends and wouldnt play with Me
All right I said
Im willing
Whats the first step
Get out of uniform and forget you ever were a soldier
Change your name
Your old one Cornelis Brandt will do but youd better spell it Brand this time
Remember that you are an engineer just back from South Africa and that you dont care a rush about the war
You cant understand what all the fools are fighting about and you think we might have peace at once by a little friendly business talk
You neednt be proGerman  if you like you can be rather severe on the Hun
But you must be in deadly earnest about a speedy peace
I expect the corners of my mouth fell for Bullivant burst out laughing
Hang it all man its not so difficult
I feel sometimes inclined to argue that way myself when my dinner doesnt agree with me
Its not so hard as to wander round the Fatherland abusing Britain which was your last job
Im ready I said
But I want to do one errand on my own first
I must see a fellow in my brigade who is in a shellshock hospital in the Cotswolds
Ishams the name of the place
The two men exchanged glances
This looks like fate said Bullivant
By all means go to Isham
The place where your work begins is only a couple of miles off
I want you to spend next Thursday night as the guest of two maiden ladies called Wymondham at Fosse Manor
You will go down there as a lone South African visiting a sick friend
They are hospitable souls and entertain many angels unawares
And I get my orders there
You get your orders and you are under bond to obey them
And Bullivant and Macgillivray smiled at each other
I was thinking hard about that odd conversation as the small Ford car which I had wired for to the inn carried me away from the suburbs of the county town into a land of rolling hills and green watermeadows
It was a gorgeous afternoon and the blossom of early June was on every tree
But I had no eyes for landscape and the summer being engaged in reprobating Bullivant and cursing my fantastic fate
I detested my new part and looked forward to naked shame
It was bad enough for anyone to have to pose as a pacifist but for me strong as a bull and as sunburnt as a gipsy and not looking my forty years it was a black disgrace
To go into Germany as an antiBritish Afrikander was a stoutish adventure but to lounge about at home talking rot was a very differentsized job
My stomach rose at the thought of it and I had pretty well decided to wire to Bullivant and cry off
There are some things that no one has a right to ask of any white man
When I got to Isham and found poor old Blaikie I didnt feel happier
He had been a friend of mine in Rhodesia and after the German SouthWest affair was over had come home to a Fusilier battalion which was in my brigade at Arras
He had been buried by a big crump just before we got our second objective and was dug out without a scratch on him but as daft as a hatter
I had heard he was mending and had promised his family to look him up the first chance I got
I found him sitting on a garden seat staring steadily before him like a lookout at sea
He knew me all right and cheered up for a second but very soon he was back at his staring and every word he uttered was like the careful speech of a drunken man
A bird flew out of a bush and I could see him holding himself tight to keep from screaming
The best I could do was to put a hand on his shoulder and stroke him as one strokes a frightened horse
The sight of the price my old friend had paid didnt put me in love with pacificism
We talked of brother officers and South Africa for I wanted to keep his thoughts off the war but he kept edging round to it
How long will the damned thing last
he asked
Oh its practically over I lied cheerfully
No more fighting for you and precious little for me
The Boche is done in all right  What youve got to do my lad is to sleep fourteen hours in the twentyfour and spend half the rest catching trout
Well have a shot at the grouse bird together this autumn and well get some of the old gang to join us
Someone put a teatray on the table beside us and I looked up to see the very prettiest girl I ever set eyes on
She seemed little more than a child and before the war would probably have still ranked as a flapper
She wore the neat blue dress and apron of a VAD
and her white cap was set on hair like spun gold
She smiled demurely as she arranged the teathings and I thought I had never seen eyes at once so merry and so grave
I stared after her as she walked across the lawn and I remember noticing that she moved with the free grace of an athletic boy
Who on earths that
I asked Blaikie
That
Oh one of the sisters he said listlessly
There are squads of them
I cant tell one from another
Nothing gave me such an impression of my friends sickness as the fact that he should have no interest in something so fresh and jolly as that girl
Presently my time was up and I had to go and as I looked back I saw him sunk in his chair again his eyes fixed on vacancy and his hands gripping his knees
The thought of him depressed me horribly
Here was I condemned to some rotten buffoonery in inglorious safety while the salt of the earth like Blaikie was paying the ghastliest price
From him my thoughts flew to old Peter Pienaar and I sat down on a roadside wall and read his last letter
It nearly made me howl
Peter you must know had shaved his beard and joined the Royal Flying Corps the summer before when we got back from the Greenmantle affair
That was the only kind of reward he wanted and though he was absurdly over age the authorities allowed it
They were wise not to stickle about rules for Peters eyesight and nerve were as good as those of any boy of twenty
I knew he would do well but I was not prepared for his immediately blazing success
He got his pilots certificate in record time and went out to France and presently even we footsloggers busy shifting ground before the Somme began to hear rumours of his doings
He developed a perfect genius for airfighting
There were plenty better trickflyers and plenty who knew more about the science of the game but there was no one with quite Peters genius for an actual scrap
He was as full of dodges a couple of miles up in the sky as he had been among the rocks of the Berg
He apparently knew how to hide in the empty air as cleverly as in the long grass of the Lebombo Flats
Amazing yarns began to circulate among the infantry about this new airman who could take cover below one plane of an enemy squadron while all the rest were looking for him
I remember talking about him with the South Africans when we were out resting next door to them after the bloody Delville Wood business
The day before we had seen a good battle in the clouds when the Boche plane had crashed and a Transvaal machinegun officer brought the report that the British airman had been Pienaar
Well done the old takhaar
he cried and started to yarn about Peters methods
It appeared that Peter had a theory that every man has a blind spot and that he knew just how to find that blind spot in the world of air
The best cover he maintained was not in cloud or a wisp of fog but in the unseeing patch in the eye of your enemy
I recognized that talk for the real thing
It was on a par with Peters doctrine of atmosphere and the double bluff and all the other principles that his queer old mind had cogitated out of his rackety life
By the end of August that year Peters was about the bestknown figure in the Flying Corps
If the reports had mentioned names he would have been a national hero but he was only Lieutenant Blank and the newspapers which expatiated on his deeds had to praise the Service and not the man
That was right enough for half the magic of our Flying Corps was its freedom from advertisement
But the British Army knew all about him and the men in the trenches used to discuss him as if he were a crack footballplayer
There was a very big German airman called Lensch one of the Albatross heroes who about the end of August claimed to have destroyed thirtytwo Allied machines
Peter had then only seventeen planes to his credit but he was rapidly increasing his score
Lensch was a mighty man of valour and a good sportsman after his fashion
He was amazingly quick at manoeuvring his machine in the actual fight but Peter was supposed to be better at forcing the kind of fight he wanted
Lensch if you like was the tactician and Peter the strategist
Anyhow the two were out to get each other
There were plenty of fellows who saw the campaign as a struggle not between Hun and Briton but between Lensch and Pienaar
The 15th September came and I got knocked out and went to hospital
When I was fit to read the papers again and receive letters I found to my consternation that Peter had been downed
It happened at the end of October when the southwest gales badly handicapped our airwork
When our bombing or reconnaissance jobs behind the enemy lines were completed instead of being able to glide back into safety we had to fight our way home slowly against a headwind exposed to Archies and Hun planes
Somewhere east of Bapaume on a return journey Peter fell in with Lensch  at least the German Press gave Lensch the credit
His petrol tank was shot to bits and he was forced to descend in a wood near Morchies
The celebrated British airman Pinner in the words of the German communique was made prisoner
I had no letter from him till the beginning of the New Year when I was preparing to return to France
It was a very contented letter
He seemed to have been fairly well treated though he had always a low standard of what he expected from the world in the way of comfort
I inferred that his captors had not identified in the brilliant airman the Dutch miscreant who a year before had broken out of a German jail
He had discovered the pleasures of reading and had perfected himself in an art which he had once practised indifferently
Somehow or other he had got a Pilgrims Progress from which he seemed to extract enormous pleasure
And then at the end quite casually he mentioned that he had been badly wounded and that his left leg would never be much use again
After that I got frequent letters and I wrote to him every week and sent him every kind of parcel I could think of
His letters used to make me both ashamed and happy
I had always banked on old Peter and here he was behaving like an early Christian martyr  never a word of complaint and just as cheery as if it were a winter morning on the high veld and we were off to ride down springbok
I knew what the loss of a leg must mean to him for bodily fitness had always been his pride
The rest of life must have unrolled itself before him very drab and dusty to the grave
But he wrote as if he were on the top of his form and kept commiserating me on the discomforts of my job
The picture of that patient gentle old fellow hobbling about his compound and puzzling over his Pilgrims Progress a cripple for life after five months of blazing glory would have stiffened the back of a jellyfish
This last letter was horribly touching for summer had come and the smell of the woods behind his prison reminded Peter of a place in the Woodbush and one could read in every sentence the ache of exile
I sat on that stone wall and considered how trifling were the crumpled leaves in my bed of life compared with the thorns Peter and Blaikie had to lie on
I thought of Sandy far off in Mesopotamia and old Blenkiron groaning with dyspepsia somewhere in America and I considered that they were the kind of fellows who did their jobs without complaining
The result was that when I got up to go on I had recovered a manlier temper
I wasnt going to shame my friends or pick and choose my duty
I would trust myself to Providence for as Blenkiron used to say Providence was all right if you gave him a chance
It was not only Peters letter that steadied and calmed me
Isham stood high up in a fold of the hills away from the main valley and the road I was taking brought me over the ridge and back to the streamside
I climbed through great beechwoods which seemed in the twilight like some green place far below the sea and then over a short stretch of hill pasture to the rim of the vale
All about me were little fields enclosed with walls of grey stone and full of dim sheep
Below were dusky woods around what I took to be Fosse Manor for the great Roman Fosse Way straight as an arrow passed over the hills to the south and skirted its grounds
I could see the stream slipping among its watermeadows and could hear the plash of the weir
A tiny village settled in a crook of the hill and its churchtower sounded seven with a curiously sweet chime
Otherwise there was no noise but the twitter of small birds and the night wind in the tops of the beeches
In that moment I had a kind of revelation
I had a vision of what I had been fighting for what we all were fighting for
It was peace deep and holy and ancient peace older than the oldest wars peace which would endure when all our swords were hammered into ploughshares
It was more for in that hour England first took hold of me
Before my country had been South Africa and when I thought of home it had been the wide sunsteeped spaces of the veld or some scented glen of the Berg
But now I realized that I had a new home
I understood what a precious thing this little England was how old and kindly and comforting how wholly worth striving for
The freedom of an acre of her soil was cheaply bought by the blood of the best of us
I knew what it meant to be a poet though for the life of me I could not have made a line of verse
For in that hour I had a prospect as if from a hilltop which made all the present troubles of the road seem of no account
I saw not only victory after war but a new and happier world after victory when I should inherit something of this English peace and wrap myself in it till the end of my days
Very humbly and quietly like a man walking through a cathedral I went down the hill to the Manor lodge and came to a door in an old redbrick facade smothered in magnolias which smelt like hot lemons in the June dusk
The car from the inn had brought on my baggage and presently I was dressing in a room which looked out on a watergarden
For the first time for more than a year I put on a starched shirt and a dinnerjacket and as I dressed I could have sung from pure lightheartedness
I was in for some arduous job and sometime that evening in that place I should get my marching orders
Someone would arrive  perhaps Bullivant  and read me the riddle
But whatever it was I was ready for it for my whole being had found a new purpose
Living in the trenches you are apt to get your horizon narrowed down to the front line of enemy barbed wire on one side and the nearest rest billets on the other
But now I seemed to see beyond the fog to a happy country
Highpitched voices greeted my ears as I came down the broad staircase voices which scarcely accorded with the panelled walls and the austere family portraits and when I found my hostesses in the hall I thought their looks still less in keeping with the house
Both ladies were on the wrong side of forty but their dress was that of young girls
Miss Doria Wymondham was tall and thin with a mass of nondescript pale hair confined by a black velvet fillet
Miss Claire Wymondham was shorter and plumper and had done her best by illapplied cosmetics to make herself look like a foreign demimondaine
They greeted me with the friendly casualness which I had long ago discovered was the right English manner towards your guests as if they had just strolled in and billeted themselves and you were quite glad to see them but mustnt be asked to trouble yourself further
The next second they were cooing like pigeons round a picture which a young man was holding up in the lamplight
He was a tallish lean fellow of round about thirty years wearing grey flannels and shoes dusty from the country roads
His thin face was sallow as if from living indoors and he had rather more hair on his head than most of us
In the glow of the lamp his features were very clear and I examined them with interest for remember I was expecting a stranger to give me orders
He had a long rather strong chin and an obstinate mouth with peevish lines about its corners
But the remarkable feature was his eyes
I can best describe them by saying that they looked hot  not fierce or angry but so restless that they seemed to ache physically and to want sponging with cold water
They finished their talk about the picture  which was couched in a jargon of which I did not understand one word  and Miss Doria turned to me and the young man
My cousin Launcelot Wake  Mr Brand
We nodded stiffly and Mr Wakes hand went up to smooth his hair in a selfconscious gesture
Has Barnard announced dinner
By the way where is Mary
She came in five minutes ago and I sent her to change said Miss Claire
I wont have her spoiling the evening with that horrid uniform
She may masquerade as she likes outofdoors but this house is for civilized people
The butler appeared and mumbled something
Come along cried Miss Doria for Im sure you are starving Mr Brand
And Launcelot has bicycled ten miles
The diningroom was very unlike the hall
The panelling had been stripped off and the walls and ceiling were covered with a dead black satiny paper on which hung the most monstrous pictures in large dullgold frames
I could only see them dimly but they seemed to be a mere riot of ugly colour
The young man nodded towards them
I see you have got the Degousses hung at last he said
How exquisite they are
cried Miss Claire
How subtle and candid and brave
Doria and I warm our souls at their flame
Some aromatic wood had been burned in the room and there was a queer sickly scent about
Everything in that place was strained and uneasy and abnormal  the candle shades on the table the mass of faked china fruit in the centre dish the gaudy hangings and the nightmarish walls
But the food was magnificent
It was the best dinner I had eaten since 1914
Tell me Mr Brand said Miss Doria her long white face propped on a muchberinged hand
You are one of us
You are in revolt against this crazy war
Why yes I said remembering my part
I think a little commonsense would settle it right away
With a little commonsense it would never have started said Mr Wake
Launcelots a CO you know said Miss Doria
I did not know for he did not look any kind of soldier 
I was just about to ask him what he commanded when I remembered that the letters stood also for Conscientious Objector and stopped in time
At that moment someone slipped into the vacant seat on my right hand
I turned and saw the VAD
girl who had brought tea to Blaikie that afternoon at the hospital
He was exempted by his Department the lady went on for hes a Civil Servant and so he never had a chance of testifying in court but no one has done better work for our cause
He is on the committee of the LDA and questions have been asked about him in Parliament
The man was not quite comfortable at this biography
He glanced nervously at me and was going to begin some kind of explanation when Miss Doria cut him short
Remember our rule Launcelot
No turgid war controversy within these walls
I agreed with her
The war had seemed closely knit to the Summer landscape for all its peace and to the noble old chambers of the Manor
But in that demented modish diningroom it was shriekingly incongruous
Then they spoke of other things
Mostly of pictures or common friends and a little of books
They paid no heed to me which was fortunate for I know nothing about these matters and didnt understand half the language
But once Miss Doria tried to bring me in
They were talking about some Russian novel  a name like Leprous Souls  and she asked me if I had read it
By a curious chance I had
It had drifted somehow into our dugout on the Scarpe and after we had all stuck in the second chapter it had disappeared in the mud to which it naturally belonged
The lady praised its poignancy and grave beauty
I assented and congratulated myself on my second escape  for if the question had been put to me I should have described it as Godforgotten twaddle
I turned to the girl who welcomed me with a smile
I had thought her pretty in her VAD
dress but now in a filmy black gown and with her hair no longer hidden by a cap she was the most ravishing thing you ever saw
And I observed something else
There was more than good looks in her young face
Her broad low brow and her laughing eyes were amazingly intelligent
She had an uncanny power of making her eyes go suddenly grave and deep like a glittering river narrowing into a pool
We shall never be introduced she said so let me reveal myself
Im Mary Lamington and these are my aunts  Did you really like Leprous Souls
it was easy enough to talk to her
And oddly enough her mere presence took away the oppression I had felt in that room
For she belonged to the outofdoors and to the old house and to the world at large
She belonged to the war and to that happier world beyond it  a world which must be won by going through the struggle and not by shirking it like those two silly ladies
I could see Wakes eyes often on the girl while he boomed and oraculated and the Misses Wymondham prattled
Presently the conversation seemed to leave the flowery paths of art and to verge perilously near forbidden topics
He began to abuse our generals in the field
I could not choose but listen
Miss Lamingtons brows were slightly bent as if in disapproval and my own temper began to rise
He had every kind of idiotic criticism  incompetence faint heartedness corruption
Where he got the stuff I cant imagine for the most grousing Tommy with his leave stopped never put together such balderdash
Worst of all he asked me to agree with him
It took all my sense of discipline
I dont know much about the subject I said but out in South Africa I did hear that the British leading was the weak point
I expect theres a good deal in what you say
It may have been fancy but the girl at my side seemed to whisper Well done
Wake and I did not remain long behind before joining the ladies I purposely cut it short for I was in mortal fear lest I should lose my temper and spoil everything
I stood up with my back against the mantelpiece for as long as a man may smoke a cigarette and I let him yarn to me while I looked steadily at his face
By this time I was very clear that Wake was not the fellow to give me my instructions
He wasnt playing a game
He was a perfectly honest crank but not a fanatic for he wasnt sure of himself
He had somehow lost his selfrespect and was trying to argue himself back into it
He had considerable brains for the reasons he gave for differing from most of his countrymen were good so far as they went
I shouldnt have cared to take him on in public argument
If you had told me about such a fellow a week before I should have been sick at the thought of him
But now I didnt dislike him
I was bored by him and I was also tremendously sorry for him
You could see he was as restless as a hen
When we went back to the hall he announced that he must get on the road and commandeered Miss Lamington to help him find his bicycle
It appeared he was staying at an inn a dozen miles off for a couple of days fishing and the news somehow made me like him better
Presently the ladies of the house departed to bed for their beauty sleep and I was left to my own devices
For some time I sat smoking in the hall wondering when the messenger would arrive
It was getting late and there seemed to be no preparation in the house to receive anybody
The butler came in with a tray of drinks and I asked him if he expected another guest that night
I adnt eard of it sir was his answer
There asnt been a telegram that I know of and I ave received no instructions
I lit my pipe and sat for twenty minutes reading a weekly paper
Then I got up and looked at the family portraits
The moon coming through the lattice invited me outofdoors as a cure for my anxiety
It was after eleven oclock and I was still without any knowledge of my next step
It is a maddening business to be screwed up for an unpleasant job and to have the wheels of the confounded thing tarry
Outside the house beyond a flagged terrace the lawn fell away white in the moonshine to the edge of the stream which here had expanded into a miniature lake
By the waters edge was a little formal garden with grey stone parapets which now gleamed like dusky marble
Great wafts of scent rose from it for the lilacs were scarcely over and the may was in full blossom
Out from the shade of it came suddenly a voice like a nightingale
It was singing the old song Cherry Ripe a common enough thing which I had chiefly known from barrelorgans
But heard in the scented moonlight it seemed to hold all the lingering magic of an elder England and of this hallowed countryside
I stepped inside the garden bounds and saw the head of the girl Mary
She was conscious of my presence for she turned towards me
I was coming to look for you she said now that the house is quiet
I have something to say to you General Hannay
She knew my name and must be somehow in the business
The thought entranced me
Thank God I can speak to you freely I cried
Who and what are you  living in that house in that kind of company
My good aunts
She laughed softly
They talk a great deal about their souls but they really mean their nerves
Why they are what you call my camouflage and a very good one too
And that cadaverous young prig
Poor Launcelot
Yes  camouflage too  perhaps something a little more
You must not judge him too harshly
But  but  I did not know how to put it and stammered in my eagerness
How can I tell that you are the right person for me to speak to
You see I am under orders and I have got none about you
I will give You Proof she said
Three days ago Sir Walter Bullivant and Mr Macgillivray told you to come here tonight and to wait here for further instructions
You met them in the little smokingroom at the back of the Rota Club
You were bidden take the name of Cornelius Brand and turn yourself from a successful general into a pacifist South African engineer
Is that correct
Perfectly
You have been restless all evening looking for the messenger to give you these instructions
Set your mind at ease
No messenger is coming
You will get your orders from me
I could not take them from a more welcome source I said
Very prettily put
If you want further credentials I can tell you much about your own doings in the past three years
I can explain to you who dont need the explanation every step in the business of the Black Stone
I think I could draw a pretty accurate map of your journey to Erzerum
You have a letter from Peter Pienaar in your pocket  I can tell you its contents
Are you willing to trust me
With all my heart I said
Good
Then my first order will try you pretty hard
For I have no orders to give you except to bid you go and steep yourself in a particular kind of life
Your first duty is to get atmosphere as your friend Peter used to say
Oh I will tell you where to go and how to behave
But I cant bid you do anything only live idly with open eyes and ears till you have got the feel of the situation
She stopped and laid a hand on my arm
It wont be easy
It would madden me and it will be a far heavier burden for a man like you
You have got to sink down deep into the life of the halfbaked the people whom this war hasnt touched or has touched in the wrong way the people who split hairs all day and are engrossed in what you and I would call selfish little fads
Yes
People like my aunts and Launcelot only for the most part in a different social grade
You wont live in an old manor like this but among gimcrack little arty houses
You will hear everything you regard as sacred laughed at and condemned and every kind of nauseous folly acclaimed and you must hold your tongue and pretend to agree
You will have nothing in the world to do except to let the life soak into you and as I have said keep your eyes and ears open
But you must give me some clue as to what I should be looking for
My orders are to give you none
Our chiefs  yours and mine  want you to go where you are going without any kind of parti pris
Remember we are still in the intelligence stage of the affair
The time hasnt yet come for a plan of campaign and still less for action
Tell me one thing I said
Is it a really big thing were after
A  really  big  thing she said slowly and very gravely
You and I and some hundred others are hunting the most dangerous man in all the world
Till we succeed everything that Britain does is crippled
If we fail or succeed too late the Allies may never win the victory which is their right
I will tell you one thing to cheer you
It is in some sort a race against time so your purgatory wont endure too long
I was bound to obey and she knew it for she took my willingness for granted
From a little gold satchel she selected a tiny box and opening it extracted a thing like a purple wafer with a white St Andrews Cross on it
What kind of watch have you
Ah a hunter
Paste that inside the lid
Some day you may be called on to show it  One other thing
Buy tomorrow a copy of the Pilgrims Progress and get it by heart
You will receive letters and messages some day and the style of our friends is apt to be reminiscent of John Bunyan 
The car will be at the door tomorrow to catch the tenthirty and I will give you the address of the rooms that have been taken for you 
Beyond that I have nothing to say except to beg you to play the part well and keep your temper
You behaved very nicely at dinner
I asked one last question as we said good night in the hall
Shall I see you again
Soon and often was the answer
Remember we are colleagues
I went upstairs feeling extraordinarily comforted
I had a perfectly beastly time ahead of me but now it was all glorified and coloured with the thought of the girl who had sung Cherry Ripe in the garden
I commended the wisdom of that old serpent Bullivant in the choice of his intermediary for Im hanged if I would have taken such orders from anyone else
CHAPTER TWO The Village Named Morality UP on the high veld our rivers are apt to be strings of pools linked by muddy trickles  the most stagnant kind of watercourse you would look for in a days journey
But presently they reach the edge of the plateau and are tossed down into the flats in noble ravines and roll thereafter in full and sounding currents to the sea
So with the story I am telling
It began in smooth reaches as idle as a millpond yet the day soon came when I was in the grip of a torrent flung breathless from rock to rock by a destiny which I could not control
But for the present I was in a backwater no less than the Garden City of Biggleswick where Mr Cornelius Brand a South African gentleman visiting England on holiday lodged in a pair of rooms in the cottage of Mr Tancred jimson
The house  or home as they preferred to name it at Biggleswick  was one of some two hundred others which ringed a pleasant Midland common
It was badly built and oddly furnished the bed was too short the windows did not fit the doors did not stay shut but it was as clean as soap and water and scrubbing could make it
The threequarters of an acre of garden were mainly devoted to the culture of potatoes though under the parlour window Mrs jimson had a plot of sweetsmelling herbs and lines of lank sunflowers fringed the path that led to the front door
It was Mrs jimson who received me as I descended from the station fly  a large red woman with hair bleached by constant exposure to weather clad in a gown which both in shape and material seemed to have been modelled on a chintz curtain
She was a good kindly soul and as proud as Punch of her house
We follow the simple life here Mr Brand she said
You must take us as you find us
I assured her that I asked for nothing better and as I unpacked in my fresh little bedroom with a west wind blowing in at the window I considered that I had seen worse quarters
I had bought in London a considerable number of books for I thought that as I would have time on my hands I might as well do something about my education
They were mostly English classics whose names I knew but which I had never read and they were all in a little flatbacked series at a shilling apiece
I arranged them on top of a chest of drawers but I kept the Pilgrims Progress beside my bed for that was one of my working tools and I had got to get it by heart
Mrs jimson who came in while I was unpacking to see if the room was to my liking approved my taste
At our midday dinner she wanted to discuss books with me and was so full of her own knowledge that I was able to conceal my ignorance
We are all labouring to express our personalities she informed me
Have you found your medium Mr Brand
is it to be the pen or the pencil
Or perhaps it is music
You have the brow of an artist the frontal bar of Michelangelo you remember
I told her that I concluded I would try literature but before writing anything I would read a bit more
It was a Saturday so jimson came back from town in the early afternoon
He was a managing clerk in some shipping office but you wouldnt have guessed it from his appearance
His city clothes were loose darkgrey flannels a soft collar an orange tie and a soft black hat
His wife went down the road to meet him and they returned handinhand swinging their arms like a couple of schoolchildren
He had a skimpy red beard streaked with grey and mild blue eyes behind strong glasses
He was the most friendly creature in the world full of rapid questions and eager to make me feel one of the family
Presently he got into a tweed Norfolk jacket and started to cultivate his garden
I took off my coat and lent him a hand and when he stopped to rest from his labours  which was every five minutes for he had no kind of physique  he would mop his brow and rub his spectacles and declaim about the good smell of the earth and the joy of getting close to Nature
Once he looked at my big brown hands and muscular arms with a kind of wistfulness
You are one of the doers Mr Brand he said and I could find it in my heart to envy you
You have seen Nature in wild forms in far countries
Some day I hope you will tell us about your life
I must be content with my little corner but happily there are no territorial limits for the mind
This modest dwelling is a watchtower from which I look over all the world
After that he took me for a walk
We met parties of returning tennisplayers and here and there a golfer
There seemed to be an abundance of young men mostly rather weedylooking but with one or two wellgrown ones who should have been fighting
The names of some of them jimson mentioned with awe
An unwholesome youth was Aronson the great novelist a sturdy bristling fellow with a fierce moustache was Letchford the celebrated leaderwriter of the Critic
Several were pointed out to me as artists who had gone one better than anybody else and a vast billowy creature was described as the leader of the new Orientalism in England
I noticed that these people according to jimson were all great and that they all dabbled in something new
There were quantities of young women too most of them rather badly dressed and inclining to untidy hair
And there were several decent couples taking the air like householders of an evening all the world Over
Most of these last were jimsons friends to whom he introduced me
They were his own class  modest folk who sought for a coloured background to their prosaic city lives and found it in this odd settlement
At supper I was initiated into the peculiar merits of Biggleswick
It is one great laboratory of thought said Mrs jimson
It is glorious to feel that you are living among the eager vital people who are at the head of all the newest movements and that the intellectual history of England is being made in our studies and gardens
The war to us seems a remote and secondary affair
As someone has said the great fights of the world are all fought in the mind
A spasm of pain crossed her husbands face
I wish I could feel it far away
After all Ursula it is the sacrifice of the young that gives people like us leisure and peace to think
Our duty is to do the best which is permitted to us but that duty is a poor thing compared with what our young soldiers are giving
I may be quite wrong about the war 
I know I cant argue with Letchford
But I will not pretend to a superiority I do not feel
I went to bed feeling that in jimson I had struck a pretty sound fellow
As I lit the candles on my dressingtable I observed that the stack of silver which I had taken out of my pockets when I washed before supper was topheavy
It had two big coins at the top and sixpences and shillings beneath
Now it is one of my oddities that ever since I was a small boy I have arranged my loose coins symmetrically with the smallest uppermost
That made me observant and led me to notice a second point
The English classics on the top of the chest of drawers were not in the order I had left them
Izaak Walton had got to the left of Sir Thomas Browne and the poet Burns was wedged disconsolately between two volumes of Hazlitt
Moreover a receipted bill which I had stuck in the Pilgrims Progress to mark my place had been moved
Someone had been going through my belongings
A moments reflection convinced me that it couldnt have been Mrs jimson
She had no servant and did the housework herself but my things had been untouched when I left the room before supper for she had come to tidy up before I had gone downstairs
Someone had been here while we were at supper and had examined elaborately everything I possessed
Happily I had little luggage and no papers save the new books and a bill or two in the name of Cornelius Brand The inquisitor whoever he was had found nothing 
The incident gave me a good deal of comfort
It had been hard to believe that any mystery could exist in this public place where people lived brazenly in the open and wore their hearts on their sleeves and proclaimed their opinions from the rooftops
Yet mystery there must be or an inoffensive stranger with a kitbag would not have received these strange attentions
I made a practice after that of sleeping with my watch below my pillow for inside the case was Mary Lamingtons label
Now began a period of pleasant idle receptiveness
Once a week it was my custom to go up to London for the day to receive letters and instructions if any should come
I had moved from my chambers in Park Lane which I leased under my proper name to a small flat in Westminster taken in the name of Cornelius Brand
The letters addressed to Park Lane were forwarded to Sir Walter who sent them round under cover to my new address
For the rest I used to spend my mornings reading in the garden and I discovered for the first time what a pleasure was to be got from old books
They recalled and amplified that vision I had seen from the Cotswold ridge the revelation of the priceless heritage which is England
I imbibed a mighty quantity of history but especially I liked the writers like Walton who got at the very heart of the English countryside
Soon too I found the Pilgrims Progress not a duty but a delight
I discovered new jewels daily in the honest old story and my letters to Peter began to be as full of it as Peters own epistles
I loved also the songs of the Elizabethans for they reminded me of the girl who had sung to me in the June night
In the afternoons I took my exercise in long tramps along the good dusty English roads
The country fell away from Biggleswick into a plain of wood and pastureland with low hills on the horizon
The Place was sown with villages each with its green and pond and ancient church
Most too had inns and there I had many a draught of cool nutty ale for the inn at Biggleswick was a reformed place which sold nothing but washy cider
Often tramping home in the dusk I was so much in love with the land that I could have sung with the pure joy of it
And in the evening after a bath there would be supper when a rather fagged jimson struggled between sleep and hunger and the lady with an artistic mutch on her untidy head talked ruthlessly of culture
Bit by bit I edged my way into local society
The Jimsons were a great help for they were popular and had a nodding acquaintance with most of the inhabitants
They regarded me as a meritorious aspirant towards a higher life and I was paraded before their friends with the suggestion of a vivid if Philistine past
If I had any gift for writing I would make a book about the inhabitants of Biggleswick
About half were respectable citizens who came there for country air and low rates but even these had a touch of queerness and had picked up the jargon of the place
The younger men were mostly Government clerks or writers or artists
There were a few widows with flocks of daughters and on the outskirts were several bigger houses  mostly houses which had been there before the garden city was planted
One of them was brandnew a staring villa with shamantique timbering stuck on the top of a hill among raw gardens
It belonged to a man called Moxon Ivery who was a kind of academic pacificist and a great god in the place
Another a quiet Georgian manor house was owned by a London publisher an ardent Liberal whose particular branch of business compelled him to keep in touch with the new movements
I used to see him hurrying to the station swinging a little black bag and returning at night with the fish for dinner
I soon got to know a surprising lot of people and they were the rummiest birds you can imagine
For example there were the Weekeses three girls who lived with their mother in a house so artistic that you broke your head whichever way you turned in it
The son of the family was a conscientious objector who had refused to do any sort of work whatever and had got quodded for his pains
They were immensely proud of him and used to relate his sufferings in Dartmoor with a gusto which I thought rather heartless
Art was their great subject and I am afraid they found me pretty heavy going
It was their fashion never to admire anything that was obviously beautiful like a sunset or a pretty woman but to find surprising loveliness in things which I thought hideous
Also they talked a language that was beyond me
This kind of conversation used to happen
 miss WEEKES Dont you admire Ursula jimson
SELF Rather
miss w She is so Johnesque in her lines
SELF Exactly
miss w And Tancred too  he is so full of nuances
SELF Rather
miss w He suggests one of Degousses countrymen
SELF Exactly
They hadnt much use for books except some Russian ones and I acquired merit in their eyes for having read Leprous Souls
If you talked to them about that divine countryside you found they didnt give a rap for it and had never been a mile beyond the village
But they admired greatly the sombre effect of a train going into Marylebone station on a rainy day
But it was the men who interested me most
Aronson the novelist proved on acquaintance the worst kind of blighter
He considered himself a genius whom it was the duty of the country to support and he sponged on his wretched relatives and anyone who would lend him money
He was always babbling about his sins and pretty squalid they were
I should like to have flung him among a few good oldfashioned fullblooded sinners of my acquaintance they would have scared him considerably
He told me that he sought reality and life and truth but it was hard to see how he could know much about them for he spent half the day in bed smoking cheap cigarettes and the rest sunning himself in the admiration of halfwitted girls
The creature was tuberculous in mind and body and the only novel of his I read pretty well turned my stomach
Mr Aronsons strong point was jokes about the war
If he heard of any acquaintance who had joined up or was even doing war work his merriment knew no bounds
My fingers used to itch to box the little wretchs ears
Letchford was a different pair of shoes
He was some kind of a man to begin with and had an excellent brain and the worst manners conceivable
He contradicted everything you said and looked out for an argument as other people look for their dinner
He was a doubleengined highspeed pacificist because he was the kind of cantankerous fellow who must always be in a minority
if Britain had stood out of the war he would have been a raving militarist but since she was in it he had got to find reasons why she was wrong
And jolly good reasons they were too
I couldnt have met his arguments if I had wanted to so I sat docilely at his feet
The world was all crooked for Letchford and God had created him with two left hands
But the fellow had merits
He had a couple of jolly children whom he adored and he would walk miles with me on a Sunday and spout poetry about the beauty and greatness of England
He was fortyfive if he had been thirty and in my battalion I could have made a soldier out of him
There were dozens more whose names I have forgotten but they had one common characteristic
They were puffed up with spiritual pride and I used to amuse myself with finding their originals in the Pilgrims Progress
When I tried to judge them by the standard of old Peter they fell woefully short
They shut out the war from their lives some out of funk some out of pure levity of mind and some because they were really convinced that the thing was all wrong
I think I grew rather popular in my role of the seeker after truth the honest colonial who was against the war by instinct and was looking for instruction in the matter
They regarded me as a convert from an alien world of action which they secretly dreaded though they affected to despise it
Anyhow they talked to me very freely and before long I had all the pacifist arguments by heart
I made out that there were three schools
One objected to war altogether and this had few adherents except Aronson and Weekes CO now languishing in Dartmoor
The second thought that the Allies cause was tainted and that Britain had contributed as much as Germany to the catastrophe
This included all the adherents of the LDA
 or League of Democrats against Aggression  a very proud body
The third and much the largest which embraced everybody else held that we had fought long enough and that the business could now be settled by negotiation since Germany had learned her lesson
I was myself a modest member of the last school but I was gradually working my way up to the second and I hoped with luck to qualify for the first
My acquaintances approved my progress
Letchford said I had a core of fanaticism in my slow nature and that I would end by waving the red flag
Spiritual pride and vanity as I have said were at the bottom of most of them and try as I might I could find nothing very dangerous in it all
This vexed me for I began to wonder if the mission which I had embarked on so solemnly were not going to be a fiasco
Sometimes they worried me beyond endurance
When the news of Messines came nobody took the slightest interest while I was aching to tooth every detail of the great fight
And when they talked on military affairs as Letchford and others did sometimes it was difficult to keep from sending them all to the devil for their amateur cocksureness would have riled job
One had got to batten down the recollection of our fellows out there who were sweating blood to keep these fools snug
Yet I found it impossible to be angry with them for long they were so babyishly innocent
Indeed I couldnt help liking them and finding a sort of quality in them
I had spent three years among soldiers and the British regular great follow that he is has his faults
His discipline makes him in a funk of redtape and any kind of superior authority
Now these people were quite honest and in a perverted way courageous
Letchford was at any rate
I could no more have done what he did and got hunted off platforms by the crowd and hooted at by women in the streets than I could have written his leading articles
All the same I was rather low about my job
Barring the episode of the ransacking of my effects the first night I had not a suspicion of a clue or a hint of any mystery
The place and the people were as open and bright as a YMCA
hut
But one day I got a solid wad of comfort
In a corner of Letchfords paper the Critic I found a letter which was one of the steepest pieces of invective I had ever met with
The writer gave tongue like a beagle pup about the prostitution as he called it of American republicanism to the vices of European aristocracies
He declared that Senator La Follette was a muchmisunderstood patriot seeing that he alone spoke for the toiling millions who had no other friend
He was mad with President Wilson and he prophesied a great awakening when Uncle Sam got up against John Bull in Europe and found out the kind of standpatter he was
The letter was signed John S Blenkiron and dated London 3 July The thought that Blenkiron was in England put a new complexion on my business
I reckoned I would see him soon for he wasnt the man to stand still in his tracks
He had taken up the role he had played before he left in December 1915 and very right too for not more than half a dozen people knew of the Erzerum affair and to the British public he was only the man who had been fired out of the Savoy for talking treason
I had felt a bit lonely before but now somewhere within the four corners of the island the best companion God ever made was writing nonsense with his tongue in his old cheek
There was an institution in Biggleswick which deserves mention
On the south of the common near the station stood a redbrick building called the Moot Hall which was a kind of church for the very undevout population
Undevout in the ordinary sense I mean for I had already counted twentyseven varieties of religious conviction including three Buddhists a Celestial Hierarch five Latter day Saints and about ten varieties of Mystic whose names I could never remember
The hall had been the gift of the publisher I have spoken of and twice a week it was used for lectures and debates
The place was managed by a committee and was surprisingly popular for it gave all the bubbling intellects a chance of airing their views
When you asked where somebody was and were told he was at Moot the answer was spoken in the respectful tone in which you would mention a sacrament
I went there regularly and got my mind broadened to cracking point
We had all the stars of the New Movements
We had Doctor Chirk who lectured on God which as far as I could make out was a new name he had invented for himself
There was a woman a terrible woman who had come back from Russia with what she called a message of healing
And to my joy one night there was a great buck nigger who had a lot to say about Africa for the Africans
I had a few words with him in Sesutu afterwards and rather spoiled his visit
Some of the people were extraordinarily good especially one jolly old fellow who talked about English folk songs and dances and wanted us to set up a Maypole
In the debates which generally followed I began to join very coyly at first but presently with some confidence
If my time at Biggleswick did nothing else it taught me to argue on my feet
The first big effort I made was on a fulldress occasion when Launcelot Wake came down to speak
Mr Ivery was in the chair  the first I had seen of him  a plump middleaged man with a colourless face and nondescript features
I was not interested in him till he began to talk and then I sat bolt upright and took notice
For he was the genuine silvertongue the sentences flowing from his mouth as smooth as butter and as neatly dovetailed as a parquet floor
He had a sort of manoftheworld manner treating his opponents with condescending geniality deprecating all passion and exaggeration and making you feel that his urbane statement must be right for if he had wanted he could have put the case so much higher
I watched him fascinated studying his face carefully and the thing that struck me was that there was nothing in it  nothing that is to say to lay hold on
It was simply nondescript so almightily commonplace that that very fact made it rather remarkable
Wake was speaking of the revelations of the Sukhomhnov trial in Russia which showed that Germany had not been responsible for the war
He was jolly good at the job and put as clear an argument as a firstclass lawyer
I had been sweating away at the subject and had all the ordinary case at my fingers ends so when I got a chance of speaking I gave them a long harangue with some good quotations I had cribbed out of the Vossische Zeitung which Letchford lent me
I felt it was up to me to be extra violent for I wanted to establish my character with Wake seeing that he was a friend of Mary and Mary would know that I was playing the game
I got tremendously applauded far more than the chief speaker and after the meeting Wake came up to me with his hot eyes and wrung my hand
Youre coming on well Brand he said and then he introduced me to Mr Ivery
Heres a second and a better Smuts he said
Ivery made me walk a bit of the road home with him
I am struck by your grip on these difficult problems Mr Brand he told me
There is much I can tell you and you may be of great value to our cause
He asked me a lot of questions about my past which I answered with easy mendacity
Before we parted he made me promise to come one night to supper
Next day I got a glimpse of Mary and to my vexation she cut me dead
She was walking with a flock of bareheaded girls all chattering hard and though she saw me quite plainly she turned away her eyes
I had been waiting for my cue so I did not lift my hat but passed on as if we were strangers
I reckoned it was part of the game but that trifling thing annoyed me and I spent a morose evening
The following day I saw her again this time talking sedately with Mr Ivery and dressed in a very pretty summer gown and a broadbrimmed straw hat with flowers in it
This time she stopped with a bright smile and held out her hand
Mr Brand isnt it
she asked with a pretty hesitation
And then turning to her companion  This is Mr Brand
He stayed with us last month in Gloucestershire
Mr Ivery announced that he and I were already acquainted
Seen in broad daylight he was a very personable fellow somewhere between fortyfive and fifty with a middleaged figure and a curiously young face
I noticed that there were hardly any lines on it and it was rather that of a very wise child than that of a man
He had a pleasant smile which made his jaw and cheeks expand like indiarubber
You are coming to sup with me Mr Brand he cried after me
On Tuesday after Moot
I have already written
He whisked Mary away from me and I had to content myself with contemplating her figure till it disappeared round a bend of the road
Next day in London I found a letter from Peter
He had been very solemn of late and very reminiscent of old days now that he concluded his active life was over
But this time he was in a different mood
I think he wrote that you and I will meet again soon my old friend
Do you remember when we went after the big blackmaned lion in the Rooirand and couldnt get on his track and then one morning we woke up and said we would get him today
 and we did but he very near got you first
Ive had a feel these last days that were both going down into the Valley to meet with Apolyon and that the devil will give us a bad time but anyhow well be together
I had the same kind of feel myself though I didnt see how Peter and I were going to meet unless I went out to the Front again and got put in the bag and sent to the same Boche prison
But I had an instinct that my time in Biggleswick was drawing to a close and that presently I would be in rougher quarters
I felt quite affectionate towards the place and took all my favourite walks and drank my own health in the brew of the village inns with a consciousness of saying goodbye
Also I made haste to finish my English classics for I concluded I wouldnt have much time in the future for miscellaneous reading
The Tuesday came and in the evening I set out rather late for the Moot Hall for I had been getting into decent clothes after a long hot stride
When I reached the place it was pretty well packed and I could only find a seat on the back benches
There on the platform was Ivery and beside him sat a figure that thrilled every inch of me with affection and a wild anticipation
I have now the privilege said the chairman of introducing to you the speaker whom we so warmly welcome our fearless and indefatigable American friend Mr Blenkiron
It was the old Blenkiron but almightily changed
His stoutness had gone and he was as lean as Abraham Lincoln
Instead of a puffy face his cheekbones and jaw stood out hard and sharp and in place of his former pasty colour his complexion had the clear glow of health
I saw now that he was a splendid figure of a man and when he got to his feet every movement had the suppleness of an athlete in training
In that moment I realized that my serious business had now begun
My senses suddenly seemed quicker my nerves tenser my brain more active
The big game had started and he and I were playing it together
I watched him with strained attention
It was a funny speech stuffed with extravagance and vehemence not very well argued and terribly discursive
His main point was that Germany was now in a fine democratic mood and might well be admitted into a brotherly partnership  that indeed she had never been in any other mood but had been forced into violence by the plots of her enemies
Much of it I should have thought was in stark defiance of the Defence of the Realm Acts but if any wise Scotland Yard officer had listened to it he would probably have considered it harmless because of its contradictions
It was full of a fierce earnestness and it was full of humour  longdrawn American metaphors at which that most critical audience roared with laughter
But it was not the kind of thing that they were accustomed to and I could fancy what Wake would have said of it
The conviction grew upon me that Blenkiron was deliberately trying to prove himself an honest idiot
If so it was a huge success
He produced on one the impression of the type of sentimental revolutionary who ruthlessly knifes his opponent and then weeps and prays over his tomb
just at the end he seemed to pull himself together and to try a little argument
He made a great point of the Austrian socialists going to Stockholm going freely and with their Governments assent from a country which its critics called an autocracy while the democratic western peoples held back
I admit I havent any real watertight proof he said but I will bet my bottom dollar that the influence which moved the Austrian Government to allow this embassy of freedom was the influence of Germany herself
And that is the land from which the Allied Pharisees draw in their skirts lest their garments be defiled
He sat down amid a good deal of applause for his audience had not been bored though I could see that some of them thought his praise of Germany a bit steep
It was all right in Biggleswick to prove Britain in the wrong but it was a slightly different thing to extol the enemy
I was puzzled about his last point for it was not of a piece with the rest of his discourse and I was trying to guess at his purpose
The chairman referred to it in his concluding remarks
I am in a position he said to bear out all that the lecturer has said
I can go further
I can assure him on the best authority that his surmise is correct and that Viennas decision to send delegates to Stockholm was largely dictated by representations from Berlin
I am given to understand that the fact has in the last few days been admitted in the Austrian Press
A vote of thanks was carried and then I found myself shaking hands with Ivery while Blenkiron stood a yard off talking to one of the Misses Weekes
The next moment I was being introduced
Mr Brand very pleased to meet you said the voice I knew so well
Mr Ivery has been telling me about you and I guess weve got something to say to each other
Were both from noo countries and weve got to teach the old nations a little horsesense
Mr Iverys car  the only one left in the neighbourhood  carried us to his villa and presently we were seated in a brightlylit dining room
It was not a pretty house but it had the luxury of an expensive hotel and the supper we had was as good as any London restaurant
Gone were the old days of fish and toast and boiled milk
Blenkiron squared his shoulders and showed himself a noble trencherman
A year ago he told our host I was the meanest kind of dyspeptic
I had the love of righteousness in my heart but I had the devil in my stomach
Then I heard stories about the Robson Brothers the star surgeons way out west in White Springs Nebraska
They were reckoned the neatest hands in the world at carving up a man and removing devilments from his intestines
Now sir Ive always fought pretty shy of surgeons for I considered that our Maker never intended His handiwork to be reconstructed like a bankrupt Dago railway
But by that time I was feeling so almighty wretched that I could have paid a man to put a bullet through my head
Theres no other way I said to myself
Either you forget your religion and your miserable cowardice and get cut up or its you for the Golden Shore
So I set my teeth and journeyed to White Springs and the Brothers had a look at my duodenum
They saw that the darned thing wouldnt do so they sidetracked it and made a noo route for my nootrition traffic
It was the cunningest piece of surgery since the Lord took a rib out of the side of our First Parent
Theyve got a mighty fine way of charging too for they take five per cent of a mans income and its all one to them whether hes a Meat King or a clerk on twenty dollars a week
I can tell you I took some trouble to be a very rich man last year
All through the meal I sat in a kind of stupor
I was trying to assimilate the new Blenkiron and drinking in the comfort of his heavenly drawl and I was puzzling my head about Ivery
I had a ridiculous notion that I had seen him before but delve as I might into my memory I couldnt place him
He was the incarnation of the commonplace a comfortable middleclass sentimentalist who patronized pacificism out of vanity but was very careful not to dip his hands too far
He was always damping down Blenkirons volcanic utterances
Of course as you know the other side have an argument which I find rather hard to meet  I can sympathize with patriotism and even with jingoism in certain moods but I always come back to this difficulty
Our opponents are not illmeaning so much as illjudging  these were the sort of sentences he kept throwing in
And he was full of quotations from private conversations he had had with every sort of person  including members of the Government
I remember that he expressed great admiration for Mr Balfour
Of all that talk I only recalled one thing clearly and I recalled it because Blenkiron seemed to collect his wits and try to argue just as he had done at the end of his lecture
He was speaking about a story he had heard from someone who had heard it from someone else that Austria in the last week of July 1914 had accepted Russias proposal to hold her hand and negotiate and that the Kaiser had sent a message to the Tsar saying he agreed
According to his story this telegram had been received in Petrograd and had been re written like Bismarcks Ems telegram before it reached the Emperor
He expressed his disbelief in the yarn
I reckon if it had been true he said wed have had the right text out long ago
Theyd have kept a copy in Berlin
All the same I did hear a sort of rumour that some kind of message of that sort was published in a German paper
Mr Ivery looked wise
You are right he said
I happen to know that it has been published
You will find it in the Wieser Zeitung
You dont say
he said admiringly
I wish I could read the old tombstone language
But if I could they wouldnt let me have the papers
Oh yes they would
Mr Ivery laughed pleasantly
England has still a good share of freedom
Any respectable person can get a permit to import the enemy press
Im not considered quite respectable for the authorities have a narrow definition of patriotism but happily I have respectable friends
Blenkiron was staying the night and I took my leave as the clock struck twelve
They both came into the hall to see me off and as I was helping myself to a drink and my host was looking for my hat and stick I suddenly heard Blenkirons whisper in my ear
London  the day after tomorrow he said
Then he took a formal farewell
Mr Brand its been an honour for me as an American citizen to make your acquaintance sir
I will consider myself fortunate if we have an early reunion
I am stopping at Claridges Hotel and I hope to be privileged to receive you there
CHAPTER THREE The Reflections of a Cured Dyspeptic Thirtyfive hours later I found myself in my rooms in Westminster
I thought there might be a message for me there for I didnt propose to go and call openly on Blenkiron at Claridges till I had his instructions
But there was no message  only a line from Peter saying he had hopes of being sent to Switzerland
That made me realize that he must be pretty badly broken up
Presently the telephone bell rang
It was Blenkiron who spoke
Go down and have a talk with your brokers about the War Loan
Arrive there about twelve oclock and dont go upstairs till you have met a friend
Youd better have a quick luncheon at your club and then come to Traills bookshop in the Haymarket at two
You can get back to Biggleswick by the 516
I did as I was bid and twenty minutes later having travelled by Underground for I couldnt raise a taxi I approached the block of chambers in Leadenhall Street where dwelt the respected firm who managed my investments
It was still a few minutes before noon and as I slowed down a familiar figure came out of the bank next door
Ivery beamed recognition
Up for the day Mr Brand
he asked
I have to see my brokers I said read the South African papers in my club and get back by the 516
Any chance of your company
Why yes  thats my train
Au revoir
We meet at the station
He bustled off looking very smart with his neat clothes and a rose in his buttonhole
I lunched impatiently and at two was turning over some new books in Traills shop with an eye on the streetdoor behind me
It seemed a public place for an assignation
I had begun to dip into a big illustrated book on flowergardens when an assistant came up
The managers compliments sir and he thinks there are some old works of travel upstairs that might interest you
I followed him obediently to an upper floor lined with every kind of volume and with tables littered with maps and engravings
This way sir he said and opened a door in the wall concealed by bogus book backs
I found myself in a little study and Blenkiron sitting in an armchair smoking
He got up and seized both my hands
Why Dick this is better than good noos
Ive heard all about your exploits since we parted a year ago on the wharf at Liverpool
Weve both been busy on our own jobs and there was no way of keeping you wise about my doings for after I thought I was cured I got worse than hell inside and as I told you had to get the doctormen to dig into me
After that I was playing a pretty dark game and had to get down and out of decent society
But holy Mike
Im a new man
I used to do my work with a sick heart and a taste in my mouth like a graveyard and now I can eat and drink what I like and frolic round like a colt
I wake up every morning whistling and thank the good God that Im alive It was a bad day for Kaiser when I got on the cars for White Springs
This is a rum place to meet I said and you brought me by a roundabout road
He grinned and offered me a cigar
There were reasons
It dont do for you and me to advertise our acquaintance in the street
As for the shop Ive owned it for five years
Ive a taste for good reading though you wouldnt think it and it tickles me to hand it out across the counter  First I want to hear about Biggleswick
There isnt a great deal to it
A lot of ignorance a large slice of vanity and a pinch or two of wrongheaded honesty  these are the ingredients of the pie
Not much real harm in it
Theres one or two dirty literary gents who should be in a navvies battalion but theyre about as dangerous as yellow Kaffir dogs
Ive learned a lot and got all the arguments by heart but you might plant a Biggleswick in every shire and it wouldnt help the Boche
I can see where the danger lies all the same
These fellows talked academic anarchism but the genuine article is somewhere about and to find it youve got to look in the big industrial districts
We had faint echoes of it in Biggleswick
I mean that the really dangerous fellows are those who want to close up the war at once and so get on with their blessed class war which cuts across nationalities
As for being spies and that sort of thing the Biggleswick lads are too callow
Yes said Blenkiron reflectively
They havent got as much sense as God gave to geese
Youre sure you didnt hit against any heavier metal
Yes
Theres a man called Launcelot Wake who came down to speak once
I had met him before
He has the makings of a fanatic and hes the more dangerous because you can see his conscience is uneasy
I can fancy him bombing a Prime Minister merely to quiet his own doubts
So he said
Nobody else
I reflected
Theres Mr Ivery but you know him better than I I shouldnt put much on him but Im not precisely certain for I never had a chance of getting to know him
Ivery said Blenkiron in surprise
He has a hobby for half baked youth just as another rich man might fancy orchids or fast trotters
You sure can place him right enough
I dare say
Only I dont know enough to be positive
He sucked at his cigar for a minute or so
I guess Dick if I told you all Ive been doing since I reached these shores you would call me a romancer
Ive been way down among the toilers
I did a spell as unskilled dilooted labour in the Barrow shipyards
I was barman in a hotel on the Portsmouth Road and I put in a black month driving a taxicab in the city of London
For a while I was the accredited correspondent of the Noo York Sentinel and used to go with the rest of the bunch to the powwows of undersecretaries of State and War Office generals
They censored my stuff so cruel that the paper fired me
Then I went on a walkingtour round England and sat for a fortnight in a little farm in Suffolk
By and by I came back to Claridges and this bookshop for I had learned most of what I wanted
I had learned he went on turning his curious full ruminating eyes on me that the British workingman is about the soundest piece of humanity on Gods earth
He grumbles a bit and jibs a bit when he thinks the Government are giving him a crooked deal but hes gotten the patience of job and the sand of a gamecock
And hes gotten humour too that tickles me to death
Theres not much trouble in that quarter for its he and his kind thats beating the Hun 
But I picked up a thing or two besides that
He leaned forward and tapped me on the knee
I reverence the British Intelligence Service
Flies dont settle on it to any considerable extent
Its got a mighty fine mesh but theres one hole in that mesh and its our job to mend it
Theres a highpowered brain in the game against us
I struck it a couple of years ago when I was hunting Dumba and Albert and I thought it was in Noo York but it wasnt
I struck its working again at home last year and located its head office in Europe
So I tried Switzerland and Holland but only bits of it were there
The centre of the web where the old spider sits is right here in England and for six months Ive been shadowing that spider
Theres a gang to help a big gang and a clever gang and partly an innocent gang
But theres only one brain and its to match that that the Robson Brothers settled my duodenum
I was listening with a quickened pulse for now at last I was getting to business
What is he  international socialist or anarchist or what
I asked
Pureblooded Boche agent but the biggestsized brand in the catalogue  bigger than Steinmeier or old Bismarcks Staubier
Thank God Ive got him located 
I must put you wise about some things
He lay back in his rubbed leather armchair and yarned for twenty minutes
He told me how at the beginning of the war Scotland Yard had had a pretty complete register of enemy spies and without making any fuss had just tidied them away
After that the covey having been broken up it was a question of picking off stray birds
That had taken some doing
There had been all kinds of inflammatory stuff around Red Masons and international anarchists and worst of all international financetouts but they had mostly been ordinary cranks and rogues the tools of the Boche agents rather than agents themselves
However by the middle Of 1915 most of the stragglers had been gathered in
But there remained loose ends and towards the close of last year somebody was very busy combining these ends into a net
Funny cases cropped up of the leakage of vital information
They began to be bad about October 1916 when the Hun submarines started on a special racket
The enemy suddenly appeared possessed of a knowledge which we thought to be shared only by half a dozen officers
Blenkiron said he was not surprised at the leakage for theres always a lot of people who hear things they oughtnt to
What surprised him was that it got so quickly to the enemy
Then after last February when the Hun submarines went in for frightfulness on a big scale the thing grew desperate
Leakages occurred every week and the business was managed by people who knew their way about for they avoided all the traps set for them and when bogus news was released on purpose they never sent it
A convoy which had been kept a deadly secret would be attacked at the one place where it was helpless
A carefully prepared defensive plan would be checkmated before it could be tried
Blenkiron said that there was no evidence that a single brain was behind it all for there was no similarity in the cases but he had a strong impression all the time that it was the work of one man
We managed to close some of the boltholes but we couldnt put our hands near the big ones
By this time said he I reckoned I was about ready to change my methods
I had been working by what the highbrows call induction trying to argue up from the deeds to the doer
Now I tried a new lay which was to calculate down from the doer to the deeds
They call it deduction
I opined that somewhere in this island was a gentleman whom we will call Mr X and that pursuing the line of business he did he must have certain characteristics
I considered very carefully just what sort of personage he must be
I had noticed that his device was apparently the Double Bluff
That is to say when he had two courses open to him A and B he pretended he was going to take B and so got us guessing that he would try A
Then he took B after all
So I reckoned that his camouflage must correspond to this little idiosyncrasy
Being a Boche agent he wouldnt pretend to be a hearty patriot an honest old bloodand bones Tory
That would be only the Single Bluff
I considered that he would be a pacifist cunning enough just to keep inside the law but with the eyes of the police on him
He would write books which would not be allowed to be exported
He would get himself disliked in the popular papers but all the mugwumps would admire his moral courage
I drew a mighty fine picture to myself of just the man I expected to find
Then I started out to look for him
Blenkirons face took on the air of a disappointed child
It was no good
I kept barking up the wrong tree and wore myself out playing the sleuth on whitesouled innocents
But youve found him all right I cried a sudden suspicion leaping into my brain
Hes found he said sadly but the credit does not belong to John S Blenkiron
That child merely muddied the pond
The big fish was left for a young lady to hook
I know I cried excitedly
Her name is Miss Mary Lamington
He shook a disapproving head
Youve guessed right my son but youve forgotten your manners
This is a rough business and we wont bring in the name of a gently reared and pureminded young girl
If we speak to her at all we call her by a pet name out of the Pilgrims Progress 
Anyhow she hooked the fish though he isnt landed
Dyou see any light
Ivery I gasped
Yes
Ivery
Nothing much to look at you say
A common middleaged piefaced golfplaying highbrow that you wouldnt keep out of a Sunday school
A touch of the drummer too to show he has no dealings with your effete aristocracy
A languishing silvertongue that adores the sound of his own voice
As mild youd say as curds and cream
Blenkiron got out of his chair and stood above me
I tell you Dick that man makes my spine cold
He hasnt a drop of good red blood in him
The dirtiest apache is a Christian gentleman compared to Moxon Ivery
Hes as cruel as a snake and as deep as hell
But by God hes got a brain below his hat
Hes hooked and were playing him but Lord knows if hell ever be landed
Why on earth dont you put him away
I asked
We havent the proof  legal proof I mean though theres buckets of the other kind
I could put up a morally certain case but hed beat me in a court of law
And half a hundred sheep would get up in Parliament and bleat about persecution
He has a graft with every collection of cranks in England and with all the geese that cackle about the liberty of the individual when the Boche is ranging about to enslave the world
No sir thats too dangerous a game
Besides Ive a better in hand Moxon Ivery is the bestaccredited member of this State
His dossier is the completest thing outside the Recording Angels little notebook
Weve taken up his references in every corner of the globe and theyre all as right as Morgans balance sheet
From these it appears hes been a high toned citizen ever since he was in shortclothes
He was raised in Norfolk and there are people living who remember his father
He was educated at Melton School and his names in the register
He was in business in Valparaiso and theres enough evidence to write three volumes of his innocent life there
Then he came home with a modest competence two years before the war and has been in the public eye ever since
He was Liberal candidate for a London constitooency and he has decorated the board of every institootion formed for the amelioration of mankind
Hes got enough alibis to choke a boa constrictor and theyre watertight and copper bottomed and theyre mostly damned lies 
But you cant beat him at that stunt
The mans the superbest actor that ever walked the earth
You can see it in his face
It isnt a face its a mask
He could make himself look like Shakespeare or Julius Caesar or Billy Sunday or BrigadierGeneral Richard Hannay if he wanted to
He hasnt got any personality either  hes got fifty and theres no one he could call his own
I reckon when the devil gets the handling of him at last hell have to put sand on his claws to keep him from slipping through
Blenkiron was settled in his chair again with one leg hoisted over the side
Weve closed a fair number of his channels in the last few months
No he dont suspect me
The world knows nothing of its greatest men and to him Im only a Yankee peacecrank who gives big subscriptions to loony societies and will travel a hundred miles to let off steam before any kind of audience
Hes been to see me at Claridges and Ive arranged that he shall know all my record
A darned bad record it is too for two years ago I was violent pro British before I found salvation and was requested to leave England
When I was home last I was officially antiwar when I wasnt stretched upon a bed of pain
Mr Moxon Ivery dont take any stock in John S Blenkiron as a serious proposition
And while Ive been here Ive been so low down in the social scale and working in so many devious ways that he cant connect me up  As I was saying weve cut most of his wires but the biggest we havent got at
Hes still sending stuff out and mighty compromising stuff it is
Now listen close Dick for were coming near your own business
It appeared that Blenkiron had reason to suspect that the channel still open had something to do with the North
He couldnt get closer than that till he heard from his people that a certain Abel Gresson had turned up in Glasgow from the States
This Gresson he discovered was the same as one Wrankester who as a leader of the Industrial Workers of the World had been mixed up in some ugly cases of sabotage in Colorado
He kept his news to himself for he didnt want the police to interfere but he had his own lot get into touch with Gresson and shadow him closely
The man was very discreet but very mysterious and he would disappear for a week at a time leaving no trace
For some unknown reason  he couldnt explain why  Blenkiron had arrived at the conclusion that Gresson was in touch with Ivery so he made experiments to prove it
I wanted various crossbearings to make certain and I got them the night before last
My visit to Biggleswick was good business
I dont know what they meant I said but I know where they came in
One was in your speech when you spoke of the Austrian socialists and Ivery took you up about them
The other was after supper when he quoted the Wieser Zeitung
Youre no fool Dick he said with his slow smile
Youve hit the mark first shot
You know me and you could follow my process of thought in those remarks
Ivery not knowing me so well and having his head full of just that sort of argument saw nothing unusual
Those bits of noos were pumped into Gresson that he might pass them on
And he did pass them on  to ivery
They completed my chain
But they were commonplace enough things which he might have guessed for himself
No they werent
They were the nicest titbits of political noos which all the cranks have been reaching after
Anyhow they were quotations from German papers
He might have had the papers themselves earlier than you thought
Wrong again
The paragraph never appeared in the Wieser Zeitung
But we faked up a torn bit of that noospaper and a very pretty bit of forgery it was and Gresson whos a kind of a scholar was allowed to have it
He passed it on
Ivery showed it me two nights ago
Nothing like it ever sullied the columns of Boche journalism
No it was a perfectly final proof  Now Dick its up to you to get after Gresson
Right I said
Im jolly glad Im to start work again
Im getting fat from lack of exercise
I suppose you want me to catch Gresson out in some piece of blackguardism and have him and Ivery snugly put away
I dont want anything of the kind he said very slowly and distinctly
Youve got to attend very close to your instructions I cherish these two beauties as if they were my own whiteheaded boys
I wouldnt for the world interfere with their comfort and liberty
I want them to go on corresponding with their friends
I want to give them every facility
He burst out laughing at my mystified face
See here Dick
How do we want to treat the Boche
Why to fill him up with all the cunningest lies and get him to act on them
Now here is Moxon Ivery who has always given them good information
They trust him absolutely and we would be fools to spoil their confidence
Only if we can find out Moxons methods we can arrange to use them ourselves and send noos in his name which isnt quite so genooine
Every word he dispatches goes straight to the Grand High Secret General Staff and old Hindenburg and Ludendorff put towels round their heads and cipher it out
We want to encourage them to go on doing it
Well arrange to send true stuff that dont matter so as theyll continue to trust him and a few selected falsehoods thatll matter like hell
Its a game you cant play for ever but with luck I propose to play it long enough to confuse Fritzs little plans
His face became serious and wore the air that our corps commander used to have at the big powwow before a push
Im not going to give you instructions for youre man enough to make your own
But I can give you the general hang of the situation
You tell Ivery youre going North to inquire into industrial disputes at first hand
That will seem to him natural and in line with your recent behaviour
Hell tell his people that youre a guileless colonial who feels disgruntled with Britain and may come in useful
Youll go to a man of mine in Glasgow a redhot agitator who chooses that way of doing his bit for his country
Its a darned hard way and darned dangerous
Through him youll get in touch with Gresson and youll keep alongside that bright citizen
Find out what he is doing and get a chance of following him
He must never suspect you and for that purpose you must be very near the edge of the law yourself
You go up there as an unabashed pacifist and youll live with folk that will turn your stomach
Maybe youll have to break some of these twocent rules the British Government have invented to defend the realm and its up to you not to get caught out 
Remember youll get no help from me
youve got to wise up about Gresson with the whole forces of the British State arrayed officially against you
I guess its a steep proposition but youre man enough to make good
As we shook hands he added a last word
You must take your own time but its not a case for slouching
Every day that passes ivery is sending out the worst kind of poison
The Boche is blowing up for a big campaign in the field and a big effort to shake the nerve and confuse the judgement of our civilians
The whole earths warweary and weve about reached the dangerpoint
Theres pretty big stakes hang on you Dick for things are getting mighty delicate
I purchased a new novel in the shop and reached St Pancras in time to have a cup of tea at the buffet
Ivery was at the bookstall buying an evening paper
When we got into the carriage he seized my Punch and kept laughing and calling my attention to the pictures
As I looked at him I thought that he made a perfect picture of the citizen turned countryman going back of an evening to his innocent home
Everything was right  his neat tweeds his light spats his spotted neckcloth and his Aquascutum
Not that I dared look at him much
What I had learned made me eager to search his face but I did not dare show any increased interest
I had always been a little offhand with him for I had never much liked him so I had to keep on the same manner
He was as merry as a grig full of chat and very friendly and amusing
I remember he picked up the book I had brought off that morning to read in the train  the second volume of Hazlitts Essays the last of my English classics  and discoursed so wisely about books that I wished I had spent more time in his company at Biggleswick
Hazlitt was the academic Radical of his day he said
He is always lashing himself into a state of theoretical fury over abuses he has never encountered in person
Men who are up against the real thing save their breath for action
That gave me my cue to tell him about my journey to the North
I said I had learned a lot in Biggleswick but I wanted to see industrial life at close quarters
Otherwise I might become like Hazlitt I said
He was very interested and encouraging
Thats the right way to set about it he said
Where were you thinking of going
I told him that I had half thought of Barrow but decided to try Glasgow since the Clyde seemed to be a warm corner
Right he said
I only wish I was coming with you
Itll take you a little while to understand the language
Youll find a good deal of senseless bellicosity among the workmen for theyve got parrotcries about the war as they used to have parrotcries about their labour politics
But theres plenty of shrewd brains and sound hearts too
You must write and tell me your conclusions
It was a warm evening and he dozed the last part of the journey
I looked at him and wished I could see into the mind at the back of that masklike face
I counted for nothing in his eyes not even enough for him to want to make me a tool and I was setting out to try to make a tool of him
It sounded a forlorn enterprise
And all the while I was puzzled with a persistent sense of recognition
I told myself it was idiocy for a man with a face like that must have hints of resemblance to a thousand people
But the idea kept nagging at me till we reached our destination
As we emerged from the station into the golden evening I saw Mary Lamington again
She was with one of the Weekes girls and after the Biggleswick fashion was bareheaded so that the sun glinted from her hair
Ivery swept his hat off and made her a pretty speech while I faced her steady eyes with the expressionlessness of the stage conspirator
A charming child he observed as we passed on
Not without a touch of seriousness too which may yet be touched to noble issues
I considered as I made my way to my final supper with the jimsons that the said child was likely to prove a sufficiently serious business for Mr Moxon Ivery before the game was out
CHAPTER FOUR Andrew Amos I took the train three days later from Kings Cross to Edinburgh
I went to the Pentland Hotel in Princes Street and left there a suitcase containing some clean linen and a change of clothes
I had been thinking the thing out and had come to the conclusion that I must have a base somewhere and a fresh outfit
Then in wellworn tweeds and with no more luggage than a small trench kitbag I descended upon the city of Glasgow
I walked from the station to the address which Blenkiron had given me
It was a hot summer evening and the streets were filled with bareheaded women and wearylooking artisans
As I made my way down the Dumbarton Road i was amazed at the number of ablebodied fellows about considering that you couldnt stir a mile on any British front without bumping up against a Glasgow battalion
Then I realized that there were such things as munitions and ships and I wondered no more
A stout and dishevelled lady at a closemouth directed me to Mr Amoss dwelling
Twa stairs up
Andra will be in noo havin his tea
Hes no yin for overtime
Hes generally hame on the chap of six
I ascended the stairs with a sinking heart for like all South Africans I have a horror of dirt
The place was pretty filthy but at each landing there were two doors with wellpolished handles and brass plates
On one I read the name of Andrew Amos
A man in his shirtsleeves opened to me a little man without a collar and with an unbuttoned waistcoat
That was all I saw of him in the dim light but he held out a paw like a gorillas and drew me in
The sittingroom which looked over many chimneys to a pale yellow sky against which two factory stalks stood out sharply gave me light enough to observe him fully
He was about five feet four broadshouldered and with a great towsy head of grizzled hair
He wore spectacles and his face was like some oldfashioned Scots ministers for he had heavy eyebrows and whiskers which joined each other under his jaw while his chin and enormous upper lip were cleanshaven
His eyes were steely grey and very solemn but full of smouldering energy
His voice was enormous and would have shaken the walls if he had not had the habit of speaking with halfclosed lips
He had not a sound tooth in his head
A saucer full of tea and a plate which had once contained ham and eggs were on the table
He nodded towards them and asked me if I had fed
Yell no eat onything
Well some would offer ye a dram but this house is staunch teetotal
I door yell have to try the nearest public if yere thirsty
I disclaimed any bodily wants and produced my pipe at which he started to fill an old clay
Mr Brands your name
he asked in his gusty voice
I was expectin ye but Dod
man yere late
He extricated from his trousers pocket an ancient silver watch and regarded it with disfavour
The dashed thing has stoppit
What do ye make the time Mr Brand
He proceeded to prise open the lid of his watch with the knife he had used to cut his tobacco and as he examined the works he turned the back of the case towards me
On the inside I saw pasted Mary Lamingtons purpleandwhite wafer
I held my watch so that he could see the same token
His keen eyes raised for a second noted it and he shut his own with a snap and returned it to his pocket
His manner lost its wariness and became almost genial
Yeve come up to see Glasgow Mr Brand
Well its a steerin bit and theres honest folk bides in it and some not so honest
They tell me yere from South Africa
Thats a long gait away but I ken something aboot South Africa for I had a cousins son oot there for his lungs
He was in a shop in Main Street Bloomfountain
They called him Peter Dobson
Ye would maybe mind of him
Then he discoursed of the Clyde
He was an incomer he told me from the Borders his native place being the town of Galashiels or as he called it Gawly
I began as a powerloom tuner in Staverts mill
Then my father deed and I took up his trade of jiner
But its no world nowadays for the sma independent business so I cam to the Clyde and learned a shipwrights job
I may say Ive become a leader in the trade for though Im no an official of the Union and not likely to be theres no mans word carries more weight than mine
And the Goavernment kens that for theyve sent me on commissions up and down the land to look at wuds and report on the nature of the timber
Bribery they think it is but Andrew Amos is not to be bribit
Hell have his say about any Goavernment on earth and tell them to their face what he thinks of them
Ay and hell fight the case of the workingman against his oppressor should it be the Goavernment or the fatted calves they ca Labour Members
Yell have heard tell o the shop stewards Mr Brand
I admitted I had for I had been well coached by Blenkiron in the current history of industrial disputes
Well Im a shop steward
We represent the rank and file against officebearers that have lost the confidence o the workingman
But Im no socialist and I would have ye keep mind of that
Im yin o the old Border radicals and Im not like to change
Im for individual liberty and equal rights and chances for all men
Ill no more bow down before a Dagon of a Goavernment official than before the Baal of a feckless Tweedside laird
Ive to keep my views to mysel for thae young lads are all druckendaft with their wee books about Cawpital and Collectivism and a wheen long senseless words I wouldna fyle my tongue with
Them and their socialism
Theres more gumption in a page of John Stuart Mill than in all that foreign trash
But as I say Ive got to keep a quiet sough for the world is gettin socialism now like the measles
It all comes of a defective eddication
And what does a Border radical say about the war
I asked
He took off his spectacles and cocked his shaggy brows at me
Ill tell ye Mr Brand
All that was bad in all that Ive ever wrestled with since I cam to years o discretion  Tories and lairds and manufacturers and publicans and the Auld Kirk  all that was bad I say for there were orra bits of decency yell find in the Germans full measure pressed down and running over
When the war started I considered the subject calmly for three days and then I said Andra Amos yeve found the enemy at last
The ones ye fought before were in a manner o speakin just misguided friends
Its either you or the Kaiser this time my man
His eyes had lost their gravity and had taken on a sombre ferocity
Ay and Ive not wavered
I got a word early in the business as to the way I could serve my country best
Its not been an easy job and theres plenty of honest folk the day will give me a bad name
They think Im stirrin up the men at home and desertin the cause o the lads at the front
Man Im keepin them straight
If I didna fight their battles on a sound economic isshue they would take the dorts and be at the mercy of the first blagyird that preached revolution
Me and my like are safetyvalves if ye follow me
And dinna you make ony mistake Mr Brand
The men that are agitating for a rise in wages are not for peace
Theyre fighting for the lads overseas as much as for themselves
Theres not yin in a thousand that wouldna sweat himself blind to beat the Germans
The Goavernment has made mistakes and maun be made to pay for them
If it were not so the men would feel like a moose in a trap for they would have no way to make their grievance felt
What for should the big man double his profits and the small man be ill set to get his ham and egg on Sabbath mornin
Thats the meaning o Labour unrest as they call it and its a good thing says I for if Labour didna get its leg over the traces now and then the spunk o the land would be dead in it and Hindenburg could squeeze it like a rotten aipple
I asked if he spoke for the bulk of the men
For ninety per cent in ony ballot
I dont say that theres not plenty of riffraff  the pintandadram gentry and the softheads that are aye reading bits of newspapers and muddlin their wits with foreign whigmaleeries
But the average man on the Clyde like the average man in ither places hates just three things and thats the Germans the profiteers as they call them and the Irish
But he hates the Germans first
The Irish
I exclaimed in astonishment
Ay the Irish cried the last of the old Border radicals
Glasgows stinkin nowadays with two things money and Irish
I mind the day when I followed Mr Gladstones Home Rule policy and used to threep about the noble generous warmhearted sister nation held in a foreign bondage
My Goad
Im not speakin about Ulster which is a dour illnatured den but our own folk all the same
But the men that will not do a hands turn to help the war and take the chance of our necessities to set up a bawbee rebellion are hateful to Goad and man
We treated them like pet lambs and thats the thanks we get
Theyre coming over here in thousands to tak the jobs of the lads that are doing their duty
I was speakin last week to a widow woman that keeps a wee dairy down the Dalmarnock Road
She has two sons and both in the airmy one in the Cameronians and one a prisoner in Germany
She was telling me that she could not keep goin any more lacking the help of the boys though she had worked her fingers to the bone
Surely its a crool job Mr Amos she says that the Goavernment should tak baith my laddies and Ill maybe never see them again and let the Irish gang free and tak the bread frae our mouth
At the gasworks across the road they took on a hundred Irish last week and every yin o them as young and well set up as you would ask to see
And my wee Davie him thats in Germany had aye a weak chest and Jimmy was troubled wi a bowel complaint
Thats surely no justice
 He broke off and lit a match by drawing it across the seat of his trousers
Its time I got the gas lichtit
Theres some men coming here at halften
As the gas squealed and flickered in the lighting he sketched for me the coming guests
Theres Macnab and Niven two o my colleagues
And theres Gilkison of the Boilerfitters and a lad Wilkie  hes got consumption and writes wee bits in the papers
And theres a queer chap o the name o Tombs  they tell me he comes frae Cambridge and is a kind of a professor there  anyway hes more stuffed wi havers than an egg wi meat
He telled me he was here to get at the heart o the workingman and I said to him that he would hae to look a bit further than the sleeve o the workinmans jaicket
Theres no muckle in his head poor soul
Then therell be Tam Norie him that edits our weekly paper  Justice for All
Tams a humorist and great on Robert Burns but he hasna the balance o a dwinin teetotum  Yell understand Mr Brand that I keep my mouth shut in such company and dont express my own views more than is absolutely necessary
I criticize whiles and that gives me a name of whunstane commonsense but I never let my tongue wag
The feck o the lads comin the night are not the real workingman  theyre just the froth on the pot but its the froth that will be useful to you
Remember theyve heard tell o ye already and yeve some sort o reputation to keep up
Will Mr Abel Gresson be here
I asked
No he said
Not yet
Him and me havena yet got to the point O payin visits
But the men that come will be Gressons friends and theyll speak of ye to him
Its the best kind of introduction ye could seek
The knocker sounded and Mr Amos hastened to admit the first comers
These were Macnab and Wilkie the one a decent middle aged man with a freshwashed face and a celluloid collar the other a roundshouldered youth with lank hair and the large eyes and luminous skin which are the marks of phthisis
This is Mr Brand boys from South Africa was Amoss presentation
Presently came Niven a bearded giant and Mr Norie the editor a fat dirty fellow smoking a rank cigar
Gilkison of the Boilerfitters when he arrived proved to be a pleasant young man in spectacles who spoke with an educated voice and clearly belonged to a slightly different social scale
Last came Tombs the Cambridge professor a lean youth with a sour mouth and eyes that reminded me of Launcelot Wake
Yell no be a mawgnate Mr Brand though ye come from South Africa said Mr Norie with a great guffaw
Not me
Im a working engineer I said
My father was from Scotland and this is my first visit to my native country as my friend Mr Amos was telling you
The consumptive looked at me suspiciously
Weve got two three of the comrades here that the cawpitalist Government expelled from the Transvaal
If yere our way of thinking ye will maybe ken them
I said I would be overjoyed to meet them but that at the time of the outrage in question I had been working on a mine a thousand miles further north
Then ensued an hour of extraordinary talk
Tombs in his sing song nambypamby University voice was concerned to get information
He asked endless questions chiefly of Gilkison who was the only one who really understood his language
I thought I had never seen anyone quite so fluent and so futile and yet there was a kind of feeble violence in him like a demented sheep
He was engaged in venting some private academic spite against society and I thought that in a revolution he would be the class of lad I would personally conduct to the nearest lamppost
And all the while Amos and Macnab and Niven carried on their own conversation about the affairs of their society wholly impervious to the tornado raging around them
It was Mr Norie the editor who brought me into the discussion
Our South African friend is very blate he said in his boisterous way
Andra if this place of yours wasnt so damned teetotal and we had a dram apiece we might get his tongue loosened
I want to hear what hes got to say about the war
You told me this morning he was sound in the faith
I said no such thing said Mr Amos
As ye ken well Tam Norie I dont judge soundness on that matter as you judge it
Im for the war myself subject to certain conditions that Ive often stated
I know nothing of Mr Brands opinions except that hes a good democrat which is more than I can say of some o your friends
Hear to Andra laughed Mr Norie
Hes thinkin the inspector in the Socialist State would be a waur kind of awristocrat then the Duke of Buccleuch
Weel theres maybe something in that
But about the war hes wrong
Ye ken my views boys
This war was made by the cawpitalists and it has been fought by the workers and its the workers that maun have the ending of it
That days comin very near
There are those that want to spin it out till Labour is that weak it can be pit in chains for the rest o time
Thats the manoeuvre were out to prevent
Weve got to beat the Germans but its the workers that has the right to judge when the enemys beaten and not the cawpitalists
What do you say Mr Brand
Mr Norie had obviously pinned his colours to the fence but he gave me the chance I had been looking for
I let them have my views with a vengeance and these views were that for the sake of democracy the war must be ended
I flatter myself I put my case well for I had got up every rotten argument and I borrowed largely from Launcelot Wakes armoury
But I didnt put it too well for I had a very exact notion of the impression I wanted to produce
I must seem to be honest and in earnest just a bit of a fanatic but principally a hardheaded businessman who knew when the time had come to make a deal
Tombs kept interrupting me with imbecile questions and I had to sit on him
At the end Mr Norie hammered with his pipe on the table
Thatll sort ye Andra
Yere entertain an angel unawares
What do ye say to that my man
Mr Amos shook his head
Ill no deny theres something in it but Im not convinced that the Germans have got enough of a wheepin
Macnab agreed with him the others were with me
Norie was for getting me to write an article for his paper and the consumptive wanted me to address a meeting
Wull ye say a that over again the morns night down at our hall in Newmilns Street
Weve got a lodge meeting o the IWB and Ill make them pit ye in the programme
He kept his luminous eyes like a sick dog s fixed on me and I saw that I had made one ally
I told him I had come to Glasgow to learn and not to teach but I would miss no chance of testifying to my faith
Now boys Im for my bed said Amos shaking the dottle from his pipe
Mr Tombs Ill conduct ye the morn over the Brigend works but Ive had enough clavers for one evening
Im a man that wants his eight hours sleep
The old fellow saw them to the door and came back to me with the ghost of a grin in his face
A queer crowd Mr Brand
Macnab didna like what ye said
He had a laddie killed in Gallypoly and hes no lookin for peace this side the grave
Hes my best friend in Glasgow
Hes an elder in the Gaelic kirk in the Cowcaddens and Im what ye call a freethinker but were wonderful agreed on the fundamentals
Ye spoke your bit verra well I must admit
Gresson will hear tell of ye as a promising recruit
Its a rotten job I said
Ay its a rotten job
I often feel like vomiting over it mysel
But its no for us to complain
Theres waur jobs oot in France for better men  A word in your ear Mr Brand
Could ye not look a bit more sheepish
Ye stare folk ower straight in the een like a Hieland sergeantmajor up at Maryhill Barracks
And he winked slowly and grotesquely with his left eye
He marched to a cupboard and produced a black bottle and glass
Im blueribbon myself but yell be the better of something to tak the taste out of your mouth
Theres Loch Katrine water at the pipe there  As I was saying theres not much ill in that lot
Tombs is a black offence but a dominies a dominie all the world over
They may crack about their Industrial Workers and the braw things theyre going to do but theres a wholesome dampness about the tinder on Clydeside
They should try Ireland
Supposing I said there was a really clever man who wanted to help the enemy
You think he could do little good by stirring up trouble in the shops here
Im positive
And if he were a shrewd fellow hed soon tumble to that
Ay
Then if he still stayed on here he would be after bigger game  something really dangerous and damnable
Amos drew down his brows and looked me in the face
I see what yere ettlin at
Ay
That would be my conclusion
I came to it weeks syne about the man yell maybe meet the morns night
Then from below the bed he pulled a box from which he drew a handsome flute
Yell forgive me Mr Brand but I aye like a tune before I go to my bed
Macnab says his prayers and I have a tune on the flute and the principle is just the same
So that singular evening closed with music  very sweet and true renderings of old Border melodies like My Peggy is a young thing and When the kye come hame
I fell asleep with a vision of Amos his face all puckered up at the mouth and a wandering sentiment in his eye recapturing in his dingy world the emotions of a boy
The widowwoman from next door who acted as housekeeper cook and general factotum to the establishment brought me shaving water next morning but I had to go without a bath
When I entered the kitchen I found no one there but while I consumed the inevitable ham and egg Amos arrived back for breakfast
He brought with him the mornings paper
The Herald says theres been a big battle at Eepers he announced
I tore open the sheet and read of the great attack Of 31 July which was spoiled by the weather
My God
I cried
Theyve got St Julien and that dirty Frezenberg ridge  and Hooge  and Sanctuary Wood
I know every inch of the damned place
 Mr Brand said a warning voice thatll never do
If our friends last night heard ye talk like that ye might as well tak the train back to London 
Theyre speakin about ye in the yards this morning
yell get a good turnout at your meeting the night but theyre SaYin that the polis will interfere
That mightna be a bad thing but I trust ye to show discretion for yell not be muckle use to onybody if they jyle ye in Duke Street
I hear Gresson will be there with a fraternal message from his lunatics in America 
Ive arranged that ye go down to Tam Norie this afternoon and give him a hand with his bit paper
Tam will tell ye the whole clash o the West country and I look to ye to keep him off the drink
Hes aye arguin that writin and drinkin gang thegither and quotin Robert Burns but the creature has a wife and five bairns dependin on him
I spent a fantastic day
For two hours I sat in Nories dirty den while he smoked and orated and when he remembered his business took down in shorthand my impressions of the Labour situation in South Africa for his rag
They were fine breezy impressions based on the most wholehearted ignorance and if they ever reached the Rand I wonder what my friends there made of Cornelius Brand their author
I stood him dinner in an indifferent eatinghouse in a street off the Broomielaw and thereafter had a drink with him in a publichouse and was introduced to some of his less reputable friends
About teatime I went back to Amoss lodgings and spent an hour or so writing a long letter to Mr Ivery
I described to him everybody I had met I gave highly coloured views of the explosive material on the Clyde and I deplored the lack of clearheadedness in the progressive forces
I drew an elaborate picture of Amos and deduced from it that the Radicals were likely to be a bar to true progress
They have switched their old militancy I wrote on to another track for with them it is a matter of conscience to be always militant
I finished up with some very crude remarks on economics culled from the tabletalk of the egregious Tombs
It was the kind of letter which I hoped would establish my character in his mind as an industrious innocent
Seven oclock found me in Newmilns Street where I was seized upon by Wilkie
He had put on a clean collar for the occasion and had partially washed his thin face
The poor fellow had a cough that shook him like the walls of a powerhouse when the dynamos are going
He was very apologetic about Amos
Andra belongs to a past worrld he said
He has a big reputation in his society and hes a fine fighter but he has no kind of Vision if ye understand me
Hes an auld Gladstonian and thats done and damned in Scotland
Hes not a Modern Mr Brand like you and me
But tonight yell meet one or two chaps thatll be worth your while to ken
Yell maybe no go quite as far as them but yere on the same road
Im hoping for the day when well have oor Councils of Workmen and Soldiers like the Russians all over the land and dictate our terms to the pawrasites in Pawrliament
They tell me too the boys in the trenches are comin round to our side
We entered the hall by a back door and in a little waitingroom I was introduced to some of the speakers
They were a scratch lot as seen in that dingy place
The chairman was a shopsteward in one of the Societies a fierce little rat of a man who spoke with a cockney accent and addressed me as Comrade
But one of them roused my liveliest interest
I heard the name of Gresson and turned to find a fellow of about thirtyfive rather sprucely dressed with a flower in his buttonhole
Mr Brand he said in a rich American voice which recalled Blenkirons
Very pleased to meet you sir
We have Come from remote parts of the globe to be present at this gathering
I noticed that he had reddish hair and small bright eyes and a nose with a droop like a Polish jews
As soon as we reached the platform I saw that there was going to be trouble
The hall was packed to the door and in all the front half there was the kind of audience I expected to see  working men of the political type who before the war would have thronged to party meetings
But not all the crowd at the back had come to listen
Some were scallawags some looked like betterclass clerks out for a spree and there was a fair quantity of khaki
There were also one or two gentlemen not strictly sober
The chairman began by putting his foot in it
He said we were there tonight to protest against the continuation of the war and to form a branch of the new British Council of Workmen and Soldiers
He told them with a fine mixture of metaphors that we had got to take the reins into our own hands for the men who were running the war had their own axes to grind and were marching to oligarchy through the blood of the workers
He added that we had no quarrel with Germany half as bad as we had with our own capitalists
He looked forward to the day when British soldiers would leap from their trenches and extend the hand of friendship to their German comrades
No me
said a solemn voice
Im not seekin a bullet in my wame  at which there was laughter and catcalls
Tombs followed and made a worse hash of it
He was determined to speak as he would have put it to democracy in its own language so he said hell several times loudly but without conviction
Presently he slipped into the manner of the lecturer and the audience grew restless
I propose to ask myself a question  he began and from the back of the hall came  And a damned sully answer yell get
After that there was no more Tombs
I followed with extreme nervousness and to my surprise got a fair hearing
I felt as mean as a mangy dog on a cold morning for I hated to talk rot before soldiers  especially before a couple of Royal Scots Fusiliers who for all I knew might have been in my own brigade
My line was the plain practical patriotic man just come from the colonies who looked at things with fresh eyes and called for a new deal
I was very moderate but to justify my appearance there I had to put in a wild patch or two and I got these by impassioned attacks on the Ministry of Munitions
I mixed up a little mild praise of the Germans whom I said I had known all over the world for decent fellows
I received little applause but no marked dissent and sat down with deep thankfulness
The next speaker put the lid on it
I believe he was a noted agitator who had already been deported
Towards him there was no lukewarmness for one half of the audience cheered wildly when he rose and the other half hissed and groaned
He began with whirlwind abuse of the idle rich then of the middleclasses he called them the rich mans flunkeys and finally of the Government
All that was fairly well received for it is the fashion of the Briton to run down every Government and yet to be very averse to parting from it
Then he started on the soldiers and slanged the officers gentry pups was his name for them and the generals whom he accused of idleness of cowardice and of habitual intoxication
He told us that our own kith and kin were sacrificed in every battle by leaders who had not the guts to share their risks
The Scots Fusiliers looked perturbed as if they were in doubt of his meaning
Then he put it more plainly
Will any soldier deny that the men are the barrage to keep the officers skins whole
Thats a bloody lee said one of the Fusilier jocks
The man took no notice of the interruption being carried away by the torrent of his own rhetoric but he had not allowed for the persistence of the interrupter
The jock got slowly to his feet and announced that he wanted satisfaction
If ye open your dirty gab to blagyird honest men Ill come up on the platform and wring your neck
At that there was a fine old row some crying out Order some Fair play and some applauding
A Canadian at the back of the hall started a song and there was an ugly press forward
The hall seemed to be moving up from the back and already men were standing in all the passages and right to the edge of the platform
I did not like the look in the eyes of these newcomers and among the crowd I saw several who were obviously plainclothes policemen
The chairman whispered a word to the speaker who continued when the noise had temporarily died down
He kept off the army and returned to the Government and for a little sluiced out pure anarchism
But he got his foot in it again for he pointed to the Sinn Feiners as examples of manly independence
At that pandemonium broke loose and he never had another look in
There were several fights going on in the hall between the public and courageous supporters of the orator
Then Gresson advanced to the edge of the platform in a vain endeavour to retrieve the day
I must say he did it uncommonly well
He was clearly a practised speaker and for a moment his appeal Now boys lets cool down a bit and talk sense had an effect
But the mischief had been done and the crowd was surging round the lonely redoubt where we sat
Besides I could see that for all his clever talk the meeting did not like the look of him
He was as mild as a turtle dove but they wouldnt stand for it
A missile hurtled past my nose and I saw a rotten cabbage envelop the baldish head of the exdeportee
Someone reached out a long arm and grabbed a chair and with it took the legs from Gresson
Then the lights suddenly went out and we retreated in good order by the platform door with a yelling crowd at our heels
It was here that the plainclothes men came in handy
They held the door while the exdeportee was smuggled out by some side entrance
That class of lad would soon cease to exist but for the protection of the law which he would abolish
The rest of us having less to fear were suffered to leak into Newmilns Street
I found myself next to Gresson and took his arm
There was something hard in his coat pocket
Unfortunately there was a big lamp at the point where we emerged and there for our confusion were the Fusilier jocks
Both were strung to fighting pitch and were determined to have someones blood
Of me they took no notice but Gresson had spoken after their ire had been roused and was marked out as a victim
With a howl of joy they rushed for him
I felt his hand steal to his sidepocket
Let that alone you fool I growled in his ear
Sure mister he said and the next second we were in the thick of it
It was like so many street fights I have seen  an immense crowd which surged up around us and yet left a clear ring
Gresson and I got against the wall on the sidewalk and faced the furious soldiery
My intention was to do as little as possible but the first minute convinced me that my companion had no idea how to use his fists and I was mortally afraid that he would get busy with the gun in his pocket
It was that fear that brought me into the scrap
The jocks were sportsmen every bit of them and only one advanced to the combat
He hit Gresson a clip on the jaw with his left and but for the wall would have laid him out
I saw in the lamplight the vicious gleam in the Americans eye and the twitch of his hand to his pocket
That decided me to interfere and I got in front of him
This brought the second jock into the fray
He was a broad thickset fellow of the adorable bandylegged stocky type that I had seen go through the Railway Triangle at Arras as though it were blottingpaper
He had some notion of fighting too and gave me a rough time for I had to keep edging the other fellow off Gresson
Go home you fool I shouted
Let this gentleman alone
I dont want to hurt you
The only answer was a hookhit which I just managed to guard followed by a mighty drive with his right which I dodged so that he barked his knuckles on the wall
I heard a yell of rage and observed that Gresson seemed to have kicked his assailant on the shin
I began to long for the police
Then there was that swaying of the crowd which betokens the approach of the forces of law and order
But they were too late to prevent trouble
In selfdefence I had to take my jock seriously and got in my blow when he had overreached himself and lost his balance
I never hit anyone so unwillingly in my life
He went over like a poled ox and measured his length on the causeway
I found myself explaining things politely to the constables
These men objected to this gentlemans speech at the meeting and I had to interfere to protect him
No no
I dont want to charge anybody
It was all a misunderstanding
I helped the stricken jock to rise and offered him ten bob for consolation
He looked at me sullenly and spat on the ground
Keep your dirty money he said
Ill be even with ye yet my man  you and that redheaded scab
Ill mind the looks of ye the next time I see ye
Gresson was wiping the blood from his cheek with a silk handkerchief
I guess Im in your debt Mr Brand he said
You may bet I wont forget it
I returned to an anxious Amos
He heard my story in silence and his only comment was Well done the Fusiliers
It might have been worse Ill not deny he went on
Yeve established some kind of a claim upon Gresson which may come in handy 
Speaking about Gresson Ive news for ye
Hes sailing on Friday as purser in the Tobermory
The Tobermorys a boat that wanders every month up the West Highlands as far as Stornoway
Ive arranged for ye to take a trip on that boat Mr Brand
I nodded
How did you find out that
I asked
It took me some finding he said dryly but Ive ways and means
Now Ill not trouble ye with advice for ye ken your job as well as me
But Im going north myself the morn to look after some of the Rossshire wuds and Ill be in the way of getting telegrams at the Kyle
Yell keep that in mind
Keep in mind too that Im a great reader of thePilgrims Progress and that Ive a cousin of the name of Ochterlony
CHAPTER FIVE Various Doings in the West The Tobermory was no ship for passengers
Its decks were littered with a hundred oddments so that a man could barely walk a step without tacking and my bunk was simply a shelf in the frowsty little saloon where the odour of ham and eggs hung like a fog
I joined her at Greenock and took a turn on deck with the captain after tea when he told me the names of the big blue hills to the north
He had a fine old coppercoloured face and sidewhiskers like an archbishop and having spent all his days beating up the western seas had as many yarns in his head as Peter himself
On this boat he announced we dont ken what a day may bring forth
I may put into Colonsay for twa hours and bide there three days
I get a telegram at Oban and the next thing Im awa ayont Barra
Sheeps the difficult business
They maun be fetched for the sales and theyre dooms slow to lift
So ye see its not what ye call a pleasure trip Maister Brand
Indeed it wasnt for the confounded tub wallowed like a fat sow as soon as we rounded a headland and got the weight of the south western wind
When asked my purpose I explained that I was a colonial of Scots extraction who was paying his first visit to his fatherland and wanted to explore the beauties of the West Highlands
I let him gather that I was not rich in this worlds goods 
Yell have a passport
he asked
Theyll no let ye go north o Fort William without one
Amos had said nothing about passports so I looked blank
I could keep ye on board for the whole voyage he went on but ye wouldna be permitted to land
if yere seekin enjoyment it would be a poor job sittin on this deck and admirin the works O God and no allowed to step on the pierhead
Ye should have applied to the military gentlemen in Glesca
But yeve plenty o time to make up your mind afore we get to Oban
Weve a heap o calls to make Mull and Islay way
The purser came up to inquire about my ticket and greeted me with a grin
Yere acquaint with Mr Gresson then
said the captain
Weel were a cheery wee ships company and thats the great thing on this kind o job
I made but a poor supper for the wind had risen to half a gale and I saw hours of wretchedness approaching
The trouble with me is that I cannot be honestly sick and get it over
Queasiness and headache beset me and there is no refuge but bed
I turned into my bunk leaving the captain and the mate smoking shag not six feet from my head and fell into a restless sleep
When I woke the place was empty and smelt vilely of stale tobacco and cheese
My throbbing brows made sleep impossible and I tried to ease them by staggering upon deck
I saw a clear windy sky with every star as bright as a live coal and a heaving waste of dark waters running to inkblack hills
Then a douche of spray caught me and sent me down the companion to my bunk again where I lay for hours trying to make a plan of campaign
I argued that if Amos had wanted me to have a passport he would have provided one so I neednt bother my head about that
But it was my business to keep alongside Gresson and if the boat stayed a week in some port and he went off ashore I must follow him
Having no passport I would have to be always dodging trouble which would handicap my movements and in all likelihood make me more conspicuous than I wanted
I guessed that Amos had denied me the passport for the very reason that he wanted Gresson to think me harmless
The area of danger would therefore be the passport country somewhere north of Fort William
But to follow Gresson I must run risks and enter that country
His suspicions if he had any would be lulled if I left the boat at Oban but it was up to me to follow overland to the north and hit the place where the Tobermory made a long stay
The confounded tub had no plans she wandered about the West Highlands looking for sheep and things and the captain himself could give me no timetable of her voyage
It was incredible that Gresson should take all this trouble if he did not know that at some place  and the right place  he would have time to get a spell ashore
But I could scarcely ask Gresson for that information though I determined to cast a wary fly over him
I knew roughly the Tobermorys course  through the Sound of Islay to Colonsay then up the east side of Mull to Oban then through the Sound of Mull to the islands with names like cocktails Rum and Eigg and Coll then to Skye and then for the Outer Hebrides
I thought the last would be the place and it seemed madness to leave the boat for the Lord knew how I should get across the Minch
This consideration upset all my plans again and I fell into a troubled sleep without coming to any conclusion
Morning found us nosing between Jura and Islay and about midday we touched at a little port where we unloaded some cargo and took on a couple of shepherds who were going to Colonsay
The mellow afternoon and the good smell of salt and heather got rid of the dregs of my queasiness and I spent a profitable hour on the pierhead with a guidebook called Baddelys Scotland and one of Bartholomews maps
I was beginning to think that Amos might be able to tell me something for a talk with the captain had suggested that the Tobermory would not dally long in the neighbourhood of Rum and Eigg
The big droving season was scarcely on yet and sheep for the Oban market would be lifted on the return journey
In that case Skye was the first place to watch and if I could get wind of any big cargo waiting there I would be able to make a plan
Amos was somewhere near the Kyle and that was across the narrows from Skye
Looking at the map it seemed to me that in spite of being passportless I might be able somehow to make my way up through Morvern and Arisaig to the latitude of Skye
The difficulty would be to get across the strip of sea but there must be boats to beg borrow or steal
I was poring over Baddely when Gresson sat down beside me
He was in a good temper and disposed to talk and to my surprise his talk was all about the beauties of the countryside
There was a kind of applegreen light over everything the steep heather hills cut into the sky like purple amethysts while beyond the straits the western ocean stretched its pale molten gold to the sunset
Gresson waxed lyrical over the scene
This just about puts me right inside Mr Brand
Ive got to get away from that little old town pretty frequent or I begin to moult like a canary
A man feels a man when he gets to a place that smells as good as this
Why in hell do we ever get messed up in those stone and lime cages
I reckon some day Ill pull my freight for a clean location and settle down there and make little poems
This place would about content me
And theres a spot out in California in the Coast ranges that Ive been keeping my eye on The odd thing was that I believe he meant it
His ugly face was lit up with a serious delight
He told me he had taken this voyage before so I got out Baddely and asked for advice
I cant spend too much time on holidaying I told him and I want to see all the beauty spots
But the best of them seem to be in the area that this fool British Government wont let you into without a passport
I suppose I shall have to leave you at Oban
Too bad he said sympathetically
Well they tell me theres some pretty sights round Oban
And he thumbed the guidebook and began to read about Glencoe
I said that was not my purpose and pitched him a yarn about Prince Charlie and how my mothers greatgrandfather had played some kind of part in that show
I told him I wanted to see the place where the Prince landed and where he left for France
So far as I can make out that wont take me into the passport country but Ill have to do a bit of footslogging
Well Im used to padding the hoof
I must get the captain to put me off in Morvern and then I can foot it round the top of Lochiel and get back to Oban through Appin
Hows that for a holiday trek
He gave the scheme his approval
But if it was me Mr Brand I would have a shot at puzzling your gallant policemen
You and I dont take much stock in Governments and their twocent laws and it would be a good game to see just how far you could get into the forbidden land
A man like you could put up a good bluff on those hayseeds
I dont mind having a bet  No I said
Im out for a rest and not for sport
If there was anything to be gained Id undertake to bluff my way to the Orkney Islands
But its a wearing job and Ive better things to think about
So
Well enjoy yourself your own way
Ill be sorry when you leave us for I owe you something for that roughhouse and beside theres darned little company in the old mossback captain
That evening Gresson and I swopped yarns after supper to the accompaniment of the Ma Goad
and Ist possible
of captain and mate
I went to bed after a glass or two of weak grog and made up for the last nights vigil by falling sound asleep
I had very little kit with me beyond what I stood up in and could carry in my waterproof pockets but on Amoss advice I had brought my little nickelplated revolver
This lived by day in my hip pocket but at night I put it behind my pillow
But when I woke next morning to find us casting anchor in the bay below rough low hills which I knew to be the island of Colonsay I could find no trace of the revolver
I searched every inch of the bunk and only shook out feathers from the mouldy ticking
I remembered perfectly putting the thing behind my head before I went to sleep and now it had vanished utterly
Of course I could not advertise my loss and I didnt greatly mind it for this was not a job where I could do much shooting
But it made me think a good deal about Mr Gresson
He simply could not suspect me if he had bagged my gun as I was pretty certain he had it must be because he wanted it for himself and not that he might disarm me
Every way I argued it I reached the same conclusion
In Gressons eyes I must seem as harmless as a child
We spent the better part of a day at Colonsay and Gresson so far as his duties allowed stuck to me like a limpet
Before I went ashore I wrote out a telegram for Amos
I devoted a hectic hour to the Pilgrims Progress but I could not compose any kind of intelligible message with reference to its text
We had all the same edition  the one in the Golden Treasury series  so I could have made up a sort of cipher by referring to lines and pages but that would have taken up a dozen telegraph forms and seemed to me too elaborate for the purpose
So I sent this message Ochterlony Post Office Kyle I hope to spend part of holiday near you and to see you if boats programme permits
Are any good cargoes waiting in your neighbourhood
Reply Post Office Oban
It was highly important that Gresson should not see this but it was the deuce of a business to shake him off
I went for a walk in the afternoon along the shore and passed the telegraph office but the confounded fellow was with me all the time
My only chance was just before we sailed when he had to go on board to check some cargo
As the telegraph office stood full in view of the ships deck I did not go near it
But in the back end of the clachan I found the schoolmaster and got him to promise to send the wire
I also bought off him a couple of wellworn sevenpenny novels
The result was that I delayed our departure for ten minutes and when I came on board faced a wrathful Gresson
Where the hell have you been
he asked
The weathers blowing up dirty and the old mans mad to get off
Didnt you get your legs stretched enough this afternoon
I explained humbly that I had been to the schoolmaster to get something to read and produced my dingy red volumes
At that his brow cleared
I could see that his suspicions were set at rest
We left Colonsay about six in the evening with the sky behind us banking for a storm and the hills of Jura to starboard an angry purple
Colonsay was too low an island to be any kind of breakwater against a western gale so the weather was bad from the start
Our course was north by east and when we had passed the buttend of the island we nosed about in the trough of big seas shipping tons of water and rolling like a buffalo
I know as much about boats as about Egyptian hieroglyphics but even my landsmans eyes could tell that we were in for a rough night
I was determined not to get queasy again but when I went below the smell of tripe and onions promised to be my undoing so I dined off a slab of chocolate and a cabin biscuit put on my waterproof and resolved to stick it out on deck
I took up position near the bows where I was out of reach of the oily steamer smells
It was as fresh as the top of a mountain but mighty cold and wet for a gusty drizzle had set in and I got the spindrift of the big waves
There I balanced myself as we lurched into the twilight hanging on with one hand to a rope which descended from the stumpy mast
I noticed that there was only an indifferent rail between me and the edge but that interested me and helped to keep off sickness
I swung to the movement of the vessel and though I was mortally cold it was rather pleasant than otherwise
My notion was to get the nausea whipped out of me by the weather and when I was properly tired to go down and turn in
I stood there till the dark had fallen
By that time I was an automaton the way a man gets on sentrygo and I could have easily hung on till morning
My thoughts ranged about the earth beginning with the business I had set out on and presently  by way of recollections of Blenkiron and Peter  reaching the German forest where in the Christmas of 1915 I had been nearly done in by fever and old Stumm
I remembered the bitter cold of that wild race and the way the snow seemed to burn like fire when I stumbled and got my face into it
I reflected that seasickness was kittens play to a good bout of malaria
The weather was growing worse and I was getting more than spindrift from the seas
I hooked my arm round the rope for my fingers were numbing
Then I fell to dreaming again principally about Fosse Manor and Mary Lamington
This so ravished me that I was as good as asleep
I was trying to reconstruct the picture as I had last seen her at Biggleswick station  A heavy body collided with me and shook my arm from the rope
I slithered across the yard of deck engulfed in a whirl of water
One foot caught a stanchion of the rail and it gave with me so that for an instant I was more than half overboard
But my fingers clawed wildly and caught in the links of what must have been the anchor chain
They held though a tons weight seemed to be tugging at my feet  Then the old tub rolled back the waters slipped off and I was sprawling on a wet deck with no breath in me and a gallon of brine in my windpipe
I heard a voice cry out sharply and a hand helped me to my feet
It was Gresson and he seemed excited
God Mr Brand that was a close call
I was coming up to find you when this damned ship took to lying on her side
I guess I must have cannoned into you and I was calling myself bad names when I saw you rolling into the Atlantic
If I hadnt got a grip on the rope I would have been down beside you
Say youre not hurt
I reckon youd better come below and get a glass of rum under your belt
Youre about as wet as mothers dishclouts
Theres one advantage about campaigning
You take your luck when it comes and dont worry about what might have been
I didnt think any more of the business except that it had cured me of wanting to be seasick
I went down to the reeking cabin without one qualm in my stomach and ate a good meal of welshrabbit and bottled Bass with a tot of rum to follow up with
Then I shed my wet garments and slept in my bunk till we anchored off a village in Mull in a clear blue morning
It took us four days to crawl up that coast and make Oban for we seemed to be a floating general store for every hamlet in those parts
Gresson made himself very pleasant as if he wanted to atone for nearly doing me in
We played some poker and I read the little books I had got in Colonsay and then rigged up a fishingline and caught saithe and lythe and an occasional big haddock
But I found the time pass slowly and I was glad that about noon one day we came into a bay blocked with islands and saw a clean little town sitting on the hills and the smoke of a railway engine
I went ashore and purchased a better brand of hat in a tweed store
Then I made a beeline for the post office and asked for telegrams
One was given to me and as I opened it I saw Gresson at my elbow
It read thus Brand Post office Oban
Page 117 paragraph 3
Ochterlony
I passed it to Gresson with a rueful face
Theres a piece of foolishness I said
Ive got a cousin whos a Presbyterian minister up in Rossshire and before I knew about this passport humbug I wrote to him and offered to pay him a visit
I told him to wire me here if it was convenient and the old idiot has sent me the wrong telegram
This was likely as not meant for some other brother parson whos got my message instead
Whats the guys name
Gresson asked curiously peering at the signature
Ochterlony
David Ochterlony
Hes a great swell at writing books but hes no earthly use at handling the telegraph
However it dont signify seeing Im not going near him
I crumpled up the pink form and tossed it on the floor
Gresson and I walked to the Tobermory together
That afternoon when I got a chance I had out my Pilgrims Progress
Page 117 paragraph 3 read Then I saw in my dream that a little off the road over against the Silvermine stood Demas gentlemanlike to call to passengers to come and see who said to Christian and his fellow Ho turn aside hither and I will show you a thing
At tea I led the talk to my own past life
I yarned about my experiences as a mining engineer and said I could never get out of the trick of looking at country with the eye of the prospector
For instance I said if this had been Rhodesia I would have said there was a good chance of copper in these little kopjes above the town
Theyre not unlike the hills round the Messina mine
I told the captain that after the war I was thinking of turning my attention to the West Highlands and looking out for minerals
Yell make nothing of it said the captain
The costs are ower big even if ye found the minerals for yed have to import a your labour
The West Hielandman is no fond o hard work
Ye ken the psalm o the crofter
O that the peats would cut themselves The fish chump on the shore And that I in my bed might lie Henceforth for ever more
Has it ever been tried
I asked
Often
Theres marble and slate quarries and there was word o coal in Benbecula
And theres the iron mines at Ranna
Wheres that
I asked
Up forenent Skye
We call in there and generally bide a bit
Theres a heap of cargo for Ranna and we usually get a good load back
But as I tell ye theres few Hielanders working there
Mostly Irish and lads frae Fife and Falkirk way
I didnt pursue the subject for I had found Demass silvermine
If the Tobermory lay at Ranna for a week Gresson would have time to do his own private business
Ranna would not be the spot for the island was bare to the world in the middle of a muchfrequented channel
But Skye was just across the way and when I looked in my map at its big wandering peninsulas I concluded that my guess had been right and that Skye was the place to make for
That night I sat on deck with Gresson and in a wonderful starry silence we watched the lights die out of the houses in the town and talked of a thousand things
I noticed  what I had had a hint of before  that my companion was no common man
There were moments when he forgot himself and talked like an educated gentleman then he would remember and relapse into the lingo of Leadville Colorado
In my character of the ingenuous inquirer I set him posers about politics and economics the kind of thing I might have been supposed to pick up from unintelligent browsing among little books
Generally he answered with some slangy catchword but occasionally he was interested beyond his discretion and treated me to a harangue like an equal
I discovered another thing that he had a craze for poetry and a capacious memory for it
I forgot how we drifted into the subject but I remember he quoted some queer haunting stuff which he said was Swinburne and verses by people I had heard of from Letchford at Biggleswick
Then he saw by my silence that he had gone too far and fell back into the jargon of the West
He wanted to know about my plans and we went down into the cabin and had a look at the map
I explained my route up Morvern and round the head of Lochiel and back to Oban by the east side of Loch Linnhe
Got you he said
Youve a hell of a walk before you
That bug never bit me and I guess Im not envying you any
And after that Mr Brand
Back to Glasgow to do some work for the cause I said lightly
Just so he said with a grin
Its a great life if you dont weaken
We steamed out of the bay next morning at dawn and about nine oclock I got on shore at a little place called Lochaline
My kit was all on my person and my waterproofs pockets were stuffed with chocolates and biscuits I had bought in Oban
The captain was discouraging
Yell get your bellyful o Hieland hills Mr Brand afore ye win round the loch head
Yell be wishin yerself back on the Tobermory
But Gresson speeded me joyfully on my way and said he wished he were coming with me
He even accompanied me the first hundred yards and waved his hat after me till I was round the turn of the road
The first stage in that journey was pure delight
I was thankful to be rid of the infernal boat and the hot summer scents coming down the glen were comforting after the cold salt smell of the sea
The road lay up the side of a small bay at the top of which a big white house stood among gardens
Presently I had left the coast and was in a glen where a brown salmonriver swirled through acres of bogmyrtle
It had its source in a loch from which the mountain rose steeply  a place so glassy in that August forenoon that every scar and wrinkle of the hillside were faithfully reflected
After that I crossed a low pass to the head of another sealock and following the map struck over the shoulder of a great hill and ate my luncheon far up on its side with a wonderful vista of wood and water below me
All that morning I was very happy not thinking about Gresson or Ivery but getting my mind clear in those wide spaces and my lungs filled with the brisk hill air
But I noticed one curious thing
On my last visit to Scotland when I covered more moorland miles a day than any man since Claverhouse I had been fascinated by the land and had pleased myself with plans for settling down in it
But now after three years of war and general rocketing I felt less drawn to that kind of landscape
I wanted something more green and peaceful and habitable and it was to the Cotswolds that my memory turned with longing
I puzzled over this till I realized that in all my Cotswold pictures a figure kept going and coming  a young girl with a cloud of gold hair and the strong slim grace of a boy who had sung Cherry Ripe in a moonlit garden
Up on that hillside I understood very clearly that I who had been as careless of women as any monk had fallen wildly in love with a child of half my age
I was loath to admit it though for weeks the conclusion had been forcing itself on me
Not that I didnt revel in my madness but that it seemed too hopeless a business and I had no use for barren philandering
But seated on a rock munching chocolate and biscuits I faced up to the fact and resolved to trust my luck
After all we were comrades in a big job and it was up to me to be man enough to win her
The thought seemed to brace any courage that was in me
No task seemed too hard with her approval to gain and her companionship somewhere at the back of it
I sat for a long time in a happy dream remembering all the glimpses I had had of her and humming her song to an audience of one blackfaced sheep
On the highroad half a mile below me I saw a figure on a bicycle mounting the hill and then getting off to mop its face at the summit
I turned my Ziess glasses on to it and observed that it was a country policeman
It caught sight of me stared for a bit tucked its machine into the side of the road and then very slowly began to climb the hillside
Once it stopped waved its hand and shouted something which I could not hear
I sat finishing my luncheon till the features were revealed to me of a fat oldish man blowing like a grampus his cap well on the back of a bald head and his trousers tied about the shins with string
There was a spring beside me and I had out my flask to round off my meal
Have a drink I said
His eye brightened and a smile overran his moist face
Thank you sir
It will be very warrm coming up the brae
You oughtnt to I said
You really oughtnt you know
Scorching up hills and then doubling up a mountain are not good for your time of life
He raised the cap of my flask in solemn salutation
Your very good health
Then he smacked his lips and had several cupfuls of water from the spring
You will haf come from Achranich way maybe
he said in his soft singsong having at last found his breath
Just so
Fine weather for the birds if there was anybody to shoot them
Ah no
There will be few shots fired today for there are no gentlemen left in Morvern
But I wass asking you if you come from Achranich if you haf seen anybody on the road
From his pocket he extricated a brown envelope and a bulky telegraph form
Will you read it sir for I haf forgot my spectacles
It contained a description of one Brand a South African and a suspected character whom the police were warned to stop and return to Oban
The description wasnt bad but it lacked any one good distinctive detail
Clearly the policeman took me for an innocent pedestrian probably the guest of some moorland shootingbox with my brown face and rough tweeds and hobnailed shoes
I frowned and puzzled a little
I did see a fellow about three miles back on the hillside
Theres a publichouse just where the burn comes in and I think he was making for it
Maybe that was your man
This wire says South African and now I remember the fellow had the look of a colonial
The policeman sighed
No doubt it will be the man
Perhaps he will haf a pistol and will shoot
Not him I laughed
He looked a mangy sort of chap and hell be scared out of his senses at the sight of you
But take my advice and get somebody with you before you tackle him
Youre always the better of a witness
That is so he said brightening
Ach these are the bad times
in old days there wass nothing to do but watch the doors at the flowershows and keep the yachts from poaching the seatrout
But now it is spies spies and Donald get out of your bed and go off twenty mile to find a German
I wass wishing the war wass by and the Germans all dead
Hear hear
I cried and on the strength of it gave him another dram
I accompanied him to the road and saw him mount his bicycle and zigzag like a snipe down the hill towards Achranich
Then I set off briskly northward
It was clear that the faster I moved the better
As I went I paid disgusted tribute to the efficiency of the Scottish police
I wondered how on earth they had marked me down
Perhaps it was the Glasgow meeting or perhaps my association with Ivery at Biggleswick
Anyhow there was somebody somewhere mighty quick at compiling a dossier
Unless I wanted to be bundled back to Oban I must make good speed to the Arisaig coast
Presently the road fell to a gleaming sealoch which lay like the blue blade of a sword among the purple of the hills
At the head there was a tiny clachan nestled among birches and rowans where a tawny burn wound to the sea
When I entered the place it was about four oclock in the afternoon and peace lay on it like a garment
In the wide sunny street there was no sign of life and no sound except of hens clucking and of bees busy among the roses
There was a little grey box of a kirk and close to the bridge a thatched cottage which bore the sign of a post and telegraph office
For the past hour I had been considering that I had better prepare for mishaps
If the police of these parts had been warned they might prove too much for me and Gresson would be allowed to make his journey unmatched
The only thing to do was to send a wire to Amos and leave the matter in his hands
Whether that was possible or not depended upon this remote postal authority
I entered the little shop and passed from bright sunshine to a twilight smelling of paraffin and blackstriped peppermint balls
An old woman with a mutch sat in an armchair behind the counter
She looked up at me over her spectacles and smiled and I took to her on the instant
She had the kind of old wise face that God loves
Beside her I noticed a little pile of books one of which was a Bible
Open on her lap was a paper the United Free Church Monthly
I noticed these details greedily for I had to make up my mind on the part to play
Its a warm day mistress I said my voice falling into the broad Lowland speech for I had an instinct that she was not of the Highlands
She laid aside her paper
It is that sir
It is grand weather for the hairst but here thats no till the hinner end o September and at the best its a bit scart o aits
Ay
Its a different thing down Annandale way I said
Her face lit up
Are ye from Dumfries sir
Not just from Dumfries but I know the Borders fine
Yell no beat them she cried
Not that this is no a guid place and Ive muckle to be thankfu for since John Sanderson  that was ma man  brought me here fortyseeven year syne come Martinmas
But the aulder I get the mair I think o the bit whaur I was born
It was twae miles from Wamphray on the Lockerbie road but they tell me the place is noo just a rickle o stanes
I was wondering mistress if I could get a cup of tea in the village
Yell hae a cup wi me she said
Its no often we see onybody frae the Borders hereaways
The kettles just on the boil
She gave me tea and scones and butter and blackcurrant jam and treacle biscuits that melted in the mouth
And as we ate we talked of many things  chiefly of the war and of the wickedness of the world
Theres nae lads left here she said
They a joined the Camerons and the feck o them fell at an awfu place called Lowse
John and me never had no boys jist the one lassie thats married on Donald Frew the Strontian carrier
I used to vex mysel about it but now I thank the Lord that in His mercy He spared me sorrow
But I wad hae liked to have had one laddie fechtin for his country
I whiles wish I was a Catholic and could pit up prayers for the sodgers that are deid
It maun be a great consolation
I whipped out the Pilgrims Progress from my pocket
That is the grand book for a time like this
Fine I ken it she said
I got it for a prize in the Sabbath School when I was a lassie
I turned the pages
I read out a passage or two and then I seemed struck with a sudden memory
This is a telegraph office mistress
Could I trouble you to send a telegram
You see Ive a cousin thats a minister in Rossshire at the Kyle and him and me are great correspondents
He was writing about something in thePilgrims Progress and I think Ill send him a telegram in answer
A letter would be cheaper she said
Ay but Im on holiday and Ive no time for writing
She gave me a form and I wrote ochterlony
Post Office Kyle
 Demas will be at his mine within the week
Strive with him lest I faint by the way
Yere unco lavish wi the words sir was her only comment
We parted with regret and there was nearly a row when I tried to pay for the tea
I was bidden remember her to one David Tudhole farmer in Nether Mirecleuch the next time I passed by Wamphray
The village was as quiet when I left it as when I had entered
I took my way up the hill with an easier mind for I had got off the telegram and I hoped I had covered my tracks
My friend the postmistress would if questioned be unlikely to recognize any South African suspect in the frank and homely traveller who had spoken with her of Annandale and thePilgrims Progress
The soft mulberry gloaming of the west coast was beginning to fall on the hills
I hoped to put in a dozen miles before dark to the next village on the map where I might find quarters
But ere I had gone far I heard the sound of a motor behind me and a car slipped past bearing three men
The driver favoured me with a sharp glance and clapped on the brakes
I noted that the two men in the tonneau were carrying sporting rifles 
Hi you sir he cried
Come here
The two riflebearers  solemn gillies  brought their weapons to attention
By God he said its the man
Whats your name
Keep him covered Angus
The gillies duly covered me and I did not like the look of their wavering barrels
They were obviously as surprised as myself
I had about half a second to make my plans
I advanced with a very stiff air and asked him what the devil he meant
No Lowland Scots for me now
My tone was that of an adjutant of a Guards battalion
My inquisitor was a tall man in an ulster with a green felt hat on his small head
He had a lean wellbred face and very choleric blue eyes
I set him down as a soldier retired Highland regiment or cavalry old style
He produced a telegraph form like the policeman
Middle height  strongly built  grey tweeds  brown hat  speaks with a colonial accent  much sunburnt
Whats your name sir
I did not reply in a colonial accent but with the hauteur of the British officer when stopped by a French sentry
I asked him again what the devil he had to do with my business
This made him angry and he began to stammer
Ill teach you what I have to do with it
Im a deputylieutenant of this county and I have Admiralty instructions to watch the coast
Damn it sir Ive a wire here from the Chief Constable describing you
Youre Brand a very dangerous fellow and we want to know what the devil youre doing here
As I looked at his wrathful eye and lean head which could not have held much brains I saw that I must change my tone
if I irritated him he would get nasty and refuse to listen and hang me up for hours
So my voice became respectful
I beg your pardon sir but Ive not been accustomed to be pulled up suddenly and asked for my credentials
My name is Blaikie Captain Robert Blaikie of the Scots Fusiliers
Im home on three weeks leave to get a little peace after Hooge
We were only hauled out five days ago
I hoped my old friend in the shellshock hospital at Isham would pardon my borrowing his identity
The man looked puzzled
How the devil am I to be satisfied about that
Have you any papers to prove it
Why no
I dont carry passports about with me on a walking tour
But you can wire to the depot or to my London address
He pulled at his yellow moustache
Im hanged if I know what to do
I want to get home for dinner
I tell you what sir Ill take you on with me and put you up for the night
My boys at home convalescing and if he says youre pukka Ill ask your pardon and give you a dashed good bottle of port
Ill trust him and I warn you hes a keen hand
There was nothing to do but consent and I got in beside him with an uneasy conscience
Supposing the son knew the real Blaikie
I asked the name of the boys battalion and was told the 10th Seaforths
That wasnt pleasant hearing for they had been brigaded with us on the Somme
But Colonel Broadbury  for he told me his name  volunteered another piece of news which set my mind at rest
The boy was not yet twenty and had only been out seven months
At Arras he had got a bit of shrapnel in his thigh which had played the deuce with the sciatic nerve and he was still on crutches
We spun over ridges of moorland always keeping northward and brought up at a pleasant whitewashed house close to the sea
Colonel Broadbury ushered me into a hall where a small fire of peats was burning and on a couch beside it lay a slim palefaced young man
He had dropped his policemans manner and behaved like a gentleman
Ted he said Ive brought a friend home for the night
I went out to look for a suspect and found a British officer
This is Captain Blaikie of the Scots Fusiliers
The boy looked at me pleasantly
Im very glad to meet you sir
Youll excuse me not getting up but Ive got a game leg
He was the copy of his father in features but dark and sallow where the other was blond
He had just the same narrow head and stubborn mouth and honest quicktempered eyes
It is the type that makes dashing regimental officers and earns VCs and gets done in wholesale
I was never that kind
I belonged to the school of the cunning cowards
In the halfhour before dinner the last wisp of suspicion fled from my hosts mind
For Ted Broadbury and I were immediately deep in shop
I had met most of his senior officers and I knew all about their doings at Arras for his brigade had been across the river on my left
We fought the great fight over again and yarned about technicalities and slanged the Staff in the way young officers have the father throwing in questions that showed how mighty proud he was of his son
I had a bath before dinner and as he led me to the bathroom he apologized very handsomely for his bad manners
Your comings been a godsend for Ted
He was moping a bit in this place
And though I say it that shouldnt hes a dashed good boy
I had my promised bottle of port and after dinner I took on the father at billiards
Then we settled in the smokingroom and I laid myself out to entertain the pair
The result was that they would have me stay a week but I spoke of the shortness of my leave and said I must get on to the railway and then back to Fort William for my luggage
So I spent that night between clean sheets and ate a Christian breakfast and was given my hosts car to set me a bit on the road
I dismissed it after half a dozen miles and following the map struck over the hills to the west
About midday I topped a ridge and beheld the Sound of Sleat shining beneath me
There were other things in the landscape
In the valley on the right a long goods train was crawling on the Mallaig railway
And across the strip of sea like some fortress of the old gods rose the dark bastions and turrets of the hills of Skye
CHAPTER SIX The Skirts of the Coolin Obviously I must keep away from the railway
If the police were after me in Morvern that line would be warned for it was a barrier I must cross if I were to go farther north
I observed from the map that it turned up the coast and concluded that the place for me to make for was the shore south of that turn where Heaven might send me some luck in the boat line
For I was pretty certain that every porter and stationmaster on that tinpot outfit was anxious to make better acquaintance with my humble self
I lunched off the sandwiches the Broadburys had given me and in the bright afternoon made my way down the hill crossed at the foot of a small freshwater lochan and pursued the issuing stream through midgeinfested woods of hazels to its junction with the sea
It was rough going but very pleasant and I fell into the same mood of idle contentment that I had enjoyed the previous morning
I never met a soul
Sometimes a roe deer broke out of the covert or an old blackcock startled me with his scolding
The place was bright with heather still in its first bloom and smelt better than the myrrh of Arabia
It was a blessed glen and I was as happy as a king till I began to feel the coming of hunger and reflected that the Lord alone knew when I might get a meal
I had still some chocolate and biscuits but I wanted something substantial
The distance was greater than I thought and it was already twilight when I reached the coast
The shore was open and desolate  great banks of pebbles to which straggled alders and hazels from the hillside scrub
But as I marched northward and turned a little point of land I saw before me in a crook of the bay a smoking cottage
And plodding along by the waters edge was the bent figure of a man laden with nets and lobster pots
Also beached on the shingle was a boat
I quickened my pace and overtook the fisherman
He was an old man with a ragged grey beard and his rig was seamans boots and a muchdarned blue jersey
He was deaf and did not hear me when I hailed him
When he caught sight of me he never stopped though he very solemnly returned my good evening
I fell into step with him and in his silent company reached the cottage
He halted before the door and unslung his burdens
The place was a tworoomed building with a roof of thatch and the walls all grown over with a yellowflowered creeper
When he had straightened his back he looked seaward and at the sky as if to prospect the weather
Then he turned on me his gentle absorbed eyes
It will haf been a fine day sir
Wass you seeking the road to anywhere
I was seeking a nights lodging I said
Ive had a long tramp on the hills and Id be glad of a chance of not going farther
We will haf no accommodation for a gentleman he said gravely
I can sleep on the floor if you can give me a blanket and a bite of supper
Indeed you will not and he smiled slowly
But I will ask the wife
Mary come here
An old woman appeared in answer to his call a woman whose face was so old that she seemed like his mother
In highland places one sex ages quicker than the other
This gentleman would like to bide the night
I wass telling him that we had a poor small house but he says he will not be minding it
She looked at me with the timid politeness that you find only in outland places
We can do our best indeed sir
The gentleman can have Colins bed in the loft but he will haf to be doing with plain food
Supper is ready if you will come in now
I had a scrub with a piece of yellow soap at an adjacent pool in the burn and then entered a kitchen blue with peatreek
We had a meal of boiled fish oatcakes and skimmilk cheese with cups of strong tea to wash it down
The old folk had the manners of princes
They pressed food on me and asked me no questions till for very decencys sake I had to put up a story and give some account of myself
I found they had a son in the Argylls and a young boy in the Navy
But they seemed disinclined to talk of them or of the war
By a mere accident I hit on the old mans absorbing interest
He was passionate about the land
He had taken part in longforgotten agitations and had suffered eviction in some ancient landlords quarrel farther north
Presently he was pouring out to me all the woes of the crofter  woes that seemed so antediluvian and forgotten that I listened as one would listen to an old song
You who come from a new country will not haf heard of these things he kept telling me but by that peat fire I made up for my defective education
He told me of evictions in the year
One somewhere in Sutherland and of harsh doings in the Outer Isles
It was far more than a political grievance
It was the lament of the conservative for vanished days and manners
Over in Skye wass the fine land for black cattle and every man had his bit herd on the hillside
But the lairds said it wass better for sheep and then they said it wass not good for sheep so they put it under deer and now there is no black cattle anywhere in Skye
I tell you it was like sad music on the bagpipes hearing that old fellow
The war and all things modern meant nothing to him he lived among the tragedies of his youth and his prime
Im a Tory myself and a bit of a landreformer so we agreed well enough
So well that I got what I wanted without asking for it
I told him I was going to Skye and he offered to take me over in his boat in the morning
It will be no trouble
Indeed no
I will be going that way myself to the fishing
I told him that after the war every acre of British soil would have to be used for the men that had earned the right to it
But that did not comfort him
He was not thinking about the land itself but about the men who had been driven from it fifty years before
His desire was not for reform but for restitution and that was past the power of any Government
I went to bed in the loft in a sad reflective mood considering how in speeding our newfangled plough we must break down a multitude of molehills and how desirable and unreplaceable was the life of the moles
In brisk shining weather with a wind from the southeast we put off next morning
In front was a brown line of low hills and behind them a little to the north that black toothcomb of mountain range which I had seen the day before from the Arisaig ridge
That is the Coolin said the fisherman
It is a bad place where even the deer cannot go
But all the rest of Skye wass the fine land for black cattle
As we neared the coast he pointed out many places
Look there Sir in that glen
I haf seen six cot houses smoking there and now there is not any left
There were three men of my own name had crofts on the machars beyond the point and if you go there you will only find the marks of their bit gardens
You will know the place by the gean trees
When he put me ashore in a sandy bay between green ridges of bracken he was still harping upon the past
I got him to take a pound  for the boat and not for the nights hospitality for he would have beaten me with an oar if I had suggested that
The last I saw of him as I turned round at the top of the hill he had still his sail down and was gazing at the lands which had once been full of human dwellings and now were desolate
I kept for a while along the ridge with the Sound of Sleat on my right and beyond it the high hills of Knoydart and Kintail
I was watching for the Tobermory but saw no sign of her
A steamer put out from Mallaig and there were several drifters crawling up the channel and once I saw the white ensign and a destroyer bustled northward leaving a cloud of black smoke in her wake
Then after consulting the map I struck across country still keeping the higher ground but except at odd minutes being out of sight of the sea
I concluded that my business was to get to the latitude of Ranna without wasting time
So soon as I changed my course I had the Coolin for company
Mountains have always been a craze of mine and the blackness and mystery of those grim peaks went to my head
I forgot all about Fosse Manor and the Cotswolds
I forgot too what had been my chief feeling since I left Glasgow a sense of the absurdity of my mission
It had all seemed too farfetched and whimsical
I was running apparently no great personal risk and I had always the unpleasing fear that Blenkiron might have been too clever and that the whole thing might be a mares nest
But that dark mountain mass changed my outlook
I began to have a queer instinct that that was the place that something might be concealed there something pretty damnable
I remember I sat on a top for half an hour raking the hills with my glasses
I made out ugly precipices and glens which lost themselves in primeval blackness
When the sun caught them  for it was a gleamy day  it brought out no colours only degrees of shade
No mountains I had ever seen  not the Drakensberg or the red kopjes of Damaraland or the cold white peaks around Erzerum  ever looked so unearthly and uncanny
Oddly enough too the sight of them set me thinking about Ivery
There seemed no link between a smooth sedentary being dwelling in villas and lecturerooms and that shaggy tangle of precipices
But I felt there was for I had begun to realize the bigness of my opponent
Blenkiron had said that he spun his web wide
That was intelligible enough among the halfbaked youth of Biggleswick and the pacifist societies or even the toughs on the Clyde
I could fit him in all right to that picture
But that he should be playing his game among those mysterious black crags seemed to make him bigger and more desperate altogether a different kind of proposition
I didnt exactly dislike the idea for my objection to my past weeks had been that I was out of my proper job and this was more my line of country
I always felt that I was a better bandit than a detective
But a sort of awe mingled with my satisfaction
I began to feel about Ivery as I had felt about the three devils of the Black Stone who had hunted me before the war and as I never felt about any other Hun
The men we fought at the Front and the men I had run across in the Greenmantle business even old Stumm himself had been human miscreants
They were formidable enough but you could gauge and calculate their capacities
But this Ivery was like a poison gas that hung in the air and got into unexpected crannies and that you couldnt fight in an upstanding way
Till then in spite of Blenkirons solemnity I had regarded him simply as a problem
But now he seemed an intimate and omnipresent enemy intangible too as the horror of a haunted house
Up on that sunny hillside with the sea winds round me and the whaups calling I got a chill in my spine when I thought of him
I am ashamed to confess it but I was also horribly hungry
There was something about the war that made me ravenous and the less chance of food the worse I felt
If I had been in London with twenty restaurants open to me I should as likely as not have gone off my feed
That was the cussedness of my stomach
I had still a little chocolate left and I ate the fishermans buttered scones for luncheon but long before the evening my thoughts were dwelling on my empty interior
I put up that night in a shepherds cottage miles from anywhere
The man was called Macmorran and he had come from Galloway when sheep were booming
He was a very good imitation of a savage a little fellow with red hair and red eyes who might have been a Pict
He lived with a daughter who had once been in service in Glasgow a fat young woman with a face entirely covered with freckles and a pout of habitual discontent
No wonder for that cottage was a pretty mean place
It was so thick with peatreek that throat and eyes were always smarting
It was badly built and must have leaked like a sieve in a storm
The father was a surly fellow whose conversation was one long growl at the world the high prices the difficulty of moving his sheep the meanness of his master and the godforsaken character of Skye
Heres me no seen bakers bread for a month and no company but a wheen ignorant Hielanders that yatter Gawlic
I wish I was back in the Glenkens
And Id gang the morn if I could get paid what Im awed
However he gave me supper  a braxy ham and oatcake and I bought the remnants off him for use next day
I did not trust his blankets so I slept the night by the fire in the ruins of an arm chair and woke at dawn with a foul taste in my mouth
A dip in the burn refreshed me and after a bowl of porridge I took the road again
For I was anxious to get to some hilltop that looked over to Ranna
Before midday I was close under the eastern side of the Coolin on a road which was more a rockery than a path
Presently I saw a big house ahead of me that looked like an inn so I gave it a miss and struck the highway that led to it a little farther north
Then I bore off to the east and was just beginning to climb a hill which I judged stood between me and the sea when I heard wheels on the road and looked back
It was a farmers gig carrying one man
I was about half a mile off and something in the cut of his jib seemed familiar
I got my glasses on him and made out a short stout figure clad in a mackintosh with a woollen comforter round its throat
As I watched it made a movement as if to rub its nose on its sleeve
That was the pet trick of one man I knew
Inconspicuously I slipped through the long heather so as to reach the road ahead of the gig
When I rose like a wraith from the wayside the horse started but not the driver
So yere there said Amoss voice
Ive news for ye
The Tobermory will be in Ranna by now
She passed Broadford two hours syne
When I saw her I yoked this beast and came up on the chance of foregathering with ye
How on earth did you know I would be here
I asked in some surprise
Oh I saw the way your mind was workin from your telegram
And says I to mysel  that man Brand says I is not the chiel to be easy stoppit
But I was feared ye might be a day late so I came up the road to hold the fort
Man Im glad to see ye
Yere younger and soopler than me and yon Gressons a stirrin lad
Theres one thing youve got to do for me I said
I cant go into inns and shops but I cant do without food
I see from the map theres a town about six miles on
Go there and buy me anything thats tinned  biscuits and tongue and sardines and a couple of bottles of whisky if you can get them
This may be a long job so buy plenty
Whaurll I put them
was his only question
We fixed on a cache a hundred yards from the highway in a place where two ridges of hill enclosed the view so that only a short bit of road was visible
Ill get back to the Kyle he told me and abody there kens Andra Amos if ye should find a way of sendin a message or comin yourself
Oh and Ive got a word to ye from a lady that we ken of
She says the sooner yere back in Vawnity Fair the better shell be pleased always provided yeve got over the Hill Difficulty
A smile screwed up his old face and he waved his whip in farewell
I interpreted Marys message as an incitement to speed but I could not make the pace
That was Gressons business
I think I was a little nettled till I cheered myself by another interpretation
She might be anxious for my safety she might want to see me again anyhow the mere sending of the message showed I was not forgotten
I was in a pleasant muse as I breasted the hill keeping discreetly in the cover of the many gullies
At the top I looked down on Ranna and the sea
There lay the Tobermory busy unloading
It would be some time no doubt before Gresson could leave
There was no rowboat in the channel yet and I might have to wait hours
I settled myself snugly between two rocks where I could not be seen and where I had a clear view of the sea and shore
But presently I found that I wanted some long heather to make a couch and I emerged to get some
I had not raised my head for a second when I flopped down again
For I had a neighbour on the hilltop
He was about two hundred yards off just reaching the crest and unlike me walking quite openly
His eyes were on Ranna so he did not notice me but from my cover I scanned every line of him
He looked an ordinary countryman wearing badly cut baggy knickerbockers of the kind that gillies affect
He had a face like a Portuguese Jew but I had seen that type before among people with Highland names they might be Jews or not but they could speak Gaelic
Presently he disappeared
He had followed my example and selected a hidingplace
It was a clear hot day but very pleasant in that airy place
Good scents came up from the sea the heather was warm and fragrant bees droned about and stray seagulls swept the ridge with their wings
I took a look now and then towards my neighbour but he was deep in his hideyhole
Most of the time I kept my glasses on Ranna and watched the doings of the Tobermory
She was tied up at the jetty but seemed in no hurry to unload
I watched the captain disembark and walk up to a house on the hillside
Then some idlers sauntered down towards her and stood talking and smoking close to her side
The captain returned and left again
A man with papers in his hand appeared and a woman with what looked like a telegram
The mate went ashore in his best clothes
Then at last after midday Gresson appeared
He joined the captain at the piermasters office and presently emerged on the other side of the jetty where some small boats were beached
A man from the Tobermory came in answer to his call a boat was launched and began to make its way into the channel
Gresson sat in the stern placidly eating his luncheon
I watched every detail of that crossing with some satisfaction that my forecast was turning out right
About halfway across Gresson took the oars but soon surrendered them to the Tobermory man and lit a pipe
He got out a pair of binoculars and raked my hillside
I tried to see if my neighbour was making any signal but all was quiet
Presently the boat was hid from me by the bulge of the hill and I caught the sound of her scraping on the beach
Gresson was not a hillwalker like my neighbour
It took him the best part of an hour to get to the top and he reached it at a point not two yards from my hidingplace
I could hear by his labouring breath that he was very blown
He walked straight over the crest till he was out of sight of Ranna and flung himself on the ground
He was now about fifty yards from me and I made shift to lessen the distance
There was a grassy trench skirting the north side of the hill deep and thickly overgrown with heather
I wound my way along it till I was about twelve yards from him where I stuck owing to the trench dying away
When I peered out of the cover I saw that the other man had joined him and that the idiots were engaged in embracing each other
I dared not move an inch nearer and as they talked in a low voice I could hear nothing of what they said
Nothing except one phrase which the strange man repeated twice very emphatically
Tomorrow night he said and I noticed that his voice had not the Highland inflection which I looked for
Gresson nodded and glanced at his watch and then the two began to move downhill towards the road I had travelled that morning
I followed as best I could using a shallow dry watercourse of which sheep had made a track and which kept me well below the level of the moor
It took me down the hill but some distance from the line the pair were taking and I had to reconnoitre frequently to watch their movements
They were still a quarter of a mile or so from the road when they stopped and stared and I stared with them
On that lonely highway travellers were about as rare as roadmenders and what caught their eye was a farmers gig driven by a thickset elderly man with a woollen comforter round his neck
I had a bad moment for I reckoned that if Gresson recognized Amos he might take fright
Perhaps the driver of the gig thought the same for he appeared to be very drunk
He waved his whip he jiggoted the reins and he made an effort to sing
He looked towards the figures on the hillside and cried out something
The gig narrowly missed the ditch and then to my relief the horse bolted
Swaying like a ship in a gale the whole outfit lurched out of sight round the corner of hill where lay my cache
If Amos could stop the beast and deliver the goods there he had put up a masterly bit of buffoonery
The two men laughed at the performance and then they parted
Gresson retraced his steps up the hill
The other man  I called him in my mind the Portuguese Jew  started off at a great pace due west across the road and over a big patch of bog towards the northern butt of the Coolin
He had some errand which Gresson knew about and he was in a hurry to perform it
It was clearly my job to get after him
I had a rotten afternoon
The fellow covered the moorland miles like a deer and under the hot August sun I toiled on his trail
I had to keep well behind and as much as possible in cover in case he looked back and that meant that when he had passed over a ridge I had to double not to let him get too far ahead and when we were in an open place I had to make wide circuits to keep hidden
We struck a road which crossed a low pass and skirted the flank of the mountains and this we followed till we were on the western side and within sight of the sea
It was gorgeous weather and out on the blue water I saw cool sails moving and little breezes ruffling the calm while I was glowing like a furnace
Happily I was in fair training and I needed it
The Portuguese Jew must have done a steady six miles an hour over abominable country
About five oclock we came to a point where I dared not follow
The road ran flat by the edge of the sea so that several miles of it were visible
Moreover the man had begun to look round every few minutes
He was getting near something and wanted to be sure that no one was in his neighbourhood
I left the road accordingly and took to the hillside which to my undoing was one long cascade of screes and tumbled rocks
I saw him drop over a rise which seemed to mark the rim of a little bay into which descended one of the big corries of the mountains
It must have been a good halfhour later before I at my greater altitude and with far worse going reached the same rim
I looked into the glen and my man had disappeared
He could not have crossed it for the place was wider than I had thought
A ring of black precipices came down to within half a mile of the shore and between them was a big stream  long shallow pools at the sea end and a chain of waterfalls above
He had gone to earth like a badger somewhere and I dared not move in case he might be watching me from behind a boulder
But even as I hesitated he appeared again fording the stream his face set on the road we had come
Whatever his errand was he had finished it and was posting back to his master
For a moment I thought I should follow him but another instinct prevailed
He had not come to this wild place for the scenery
Somewhere down in the glen there was something or somebody that held the key of the mystery
It was my business to stay there till I had unlocked it
Besides in two hours it would be dark and I had had enough walking for one day
I made my way to the stream side and had a long drink
The corrie behind me was lit up with the westering sun and the bald cliffs were flushed with pink and gold
On each side of the stream was turf like a lawn perhaps a hundred yards wide and then a tangle of long heather and boulders right up to the edge of the great rocks
I had never seen a more delectable evening but I could not enjoy its peace because of my anxiety about the Portuguese Jew
He had not been there more than half an hour just about long enough for a man to travel to the first ridge across the burn and back
Yet he had found time to do his business
He might have left a letter in some prearranged place  in which case I would stay there till the man it was meant for turned up
Or he might have met someone though I didnt think that possible
As I scanned the acres of rough moor and then looked at the sea lapping delicately on the grey sand I had the feeling that a knotty problem was before me
It was too dark to try to track his steps
That must be left for the morning and I prayed that there would be no rain in the night
I ate for supper most of the braxy ham and oatcake I had brought from Macmorrans cottage
It took some selfdenial for I was ferociously hungry to save a little for breakfast next morning
Then I pulled heather and bracken and made myself a bed in the shelter of a rock which stood on a knoll above the stream
My bed chamber was well hidden but at the same time if anything should appear in the early dawn it gave me a prospect
With my waterproof I was perfectly warm and after smoking two pipes I fell asleep
My nights rest was broken
First it was a fox which came and barked at my ear and woke me to a pitchblack night with scarcely a star showing
The next time it was nothing but a wandering hill wind but as I sat up and listened I thought I saw a spark of light near the edge of the sea
It was only for a second but it disquieted me
I got out and climbed on the top of the rock but all was still save for the gentle lap of the tide and the croak of some night bird among the crags
The third time I was suddenly quite wide awake and without any reason for I had not been dreaming
Now I have slept hundreds of times alone beside my horse on the veld and I never knew any cause for such awakenings but the one and that was the presence near me of some human being
A man who is accustomed to solitude gets this extra sense which announces like an alarmclock the approach of one of his kind
But I could hear nothing
There was a scraping and rustling on the moor but that was only the wind and the little wild things of the hills
A fox perhaps or a blue hare
I convinced my reason but not my senses and for long I lay awake with my ears at full cock and every nerve tense
Then I fell asleep and woke to the first flush of dawn
The sun was behind the Coolin and the hills were black as ink but far out in the western seas was a broad band of gold
I got up and went down to the shore
The mouth of the stream was shallow but as I moved south I came to a place where two small capes enclosed an inlet
It must have been a fault in the volcanic rock for its depth was portentous
I stripped and dived far into its cold abysses but I did not reach the bottom
I came to the surface rather breathless and struck out to sea where I floated on my back and looked at the great rampart of crag
I saw that the place where I had spent the night was only a little oasis of green at the base of one of the grimmest corries the imagination could picture
It was as desert as Damaraland
I noticed too how sharply the cliffs rose from the level
There were chimneys and gullies by which a man might have made his way to the summit but no one of them could have been scaled except by a mountaineer
I was feeling better now with all the frowsiness washed out of me and I dried myself by racing up and down the heather
Then I noticed something
There were marks of human feet at the top of the deepwater inlet  not mine for they were on the other side
The short seaturf was bruised and trampled in several places and there were broken stems of bracken
I thought that some fisherman had probably landed there to stretch his legs
But that set me thinking of the Portuguese Jew
After breakfasting on my last morsels of food  a knuckle of braxy and a bit of oatcake  I set about tracking him from the place where he had first entered the glen
To get my bearings I went back over the road I had come myself and after a good deal of trouble I found his spoor
It was pretty clear as far as the stream for he had been walking  or rather running  over ground with many patches of gravel on it
After that it was difficult and I lost it entirely in the rough heather below the crags
All that I could make out for certain was that he had crossed the stream and that his business whatever it was had been with the few acres of tumbled wilderness below the precipices
I spent a busy morning there but found nothing except the skeleton of a sheep picked clean by the ravens
It was a thankless job and I got very cross over it
I had an ugly feeling that I was on a false scent and wasting my time
I wished to Heaven I had old Peter with me
He could follow spoor like a Bushman and would have riddled the Portuguese jews track out of any jungle on earth
That was a game I had never learned for in the old days I had always left it to my natives
I chucked the attempt and lay disconsolately on a warm patch of grass and smoked and thought about Peter
But my chief reflections were that I had breakfasted at five that it was now eleven that I was intolerably hungry that there was nothing here to feed a grasshopper and that I should starve unless I got supplies
It was a long road to my cache but there were no two ways of it
My only hope was to sit tight in the glen and it might involve a wait of days
To wait I must have food and though it meant relinquishing guard for a matter of six hours the risk had to be taken
I set off at a brisk pace with a very depressed mind
From the map it seemed that a short cut lay over a pass in the range
I resolved to take it and that short cut like most of its kind was unblessed by Heaven
I will not dwell upon the discomforts of the journey
I found myself slithering among screes climbing steep chimneys and travelling precariously along razorbacks
The shoes were nearly rent from my feet by the infernal rockswhich were all pitted as if by some geological smallpox
When at last I crossed the divide I had a horrible business getting down from one level to another in a gruesome corrie where each step was composed of smooth boilerplates
But at last I was among the bogs on the east side and came to the place beside the road where I had fixed my cache
The faithful Amos had not failed me
There were the provisions  a couple of small loaves a dozen tins and a bottle of whisky
I made the best pack I could of them in my waterproof swung it on my stick and started back thinking that I must be very like the picture of Christian on the titlepage ofPilgrims Progress
I was liker Christian before I reached my destination  Christian after he had got up the Hill Difficulty
The mornings walk had been bad but the afternoons was worse for I was in a fever to get back and having had enough of the hills chose the longer route I had followed the previous day
I was mortally afraid of being seen for I cut a queer figure so I avoided every stretch of road where I had not a clear view ahead
Many weary detours I made among mosshags and screes and the stony channels of burns
But I got there at last and it was almost with a sense of comfort that I flung my pack down beside the stream where I had passed the night
I ate a good meal lit my pipe and fell into the equable mood which follows upon fatigue ended and hunger satisfied
The sun was westering and its light fell upon the rockwall above the place where I had abandoned my search for the spoor
As I gazed at it idly I saw a curious thing
It seemed to be split in two and a shaft of sunlight came through between
There could be no doubt about it
I saw the end of the shaft on the moor beneath while all the rest lay in shadow
I rubbed my eyes and got out my glasses
Then I guessed the explanation
There was a rock tower close against the face of the main precipice and indistinguishable from it to anyone looking direct at the face
Only when the sun fell on it obliquely could it be discovered
And between the tower and the cliff there must be a substantial hollow
The discovery brought me to my feet and set me running towards the end of the shaft of sunlight
I left the heather scrambled up some yards of screes and had a difficult time on some very smooth slabs where only the friction of tweed and rough rock gave me a hold
Slowly I worked my way towards the speck of sunlight till I found a handhold and swung myself into the crack
On one side was the main wall of the hill on the other a tower some ninety feet high and between them a long crevice varying in width from three to six feet
Beyond it there showed a small bright patch of sea
There was more for at the point where I entered it there was an overhang which made a fine cavern low at the entrance but a dozen feet high inside and as dry as tinder
Here thought I is the perfect hidingplace
Before going farther I resolved to return for food
It was not very easy descending and I slipped the last twenty feet landing on my head in a soft patch of screes
At the burnside I filled my flask from the whisky bottle and put half a loaf a tin of sardines a tin of tongue and a packet of chocolate in my waterproof pockets
Laden as I was it took me some time to get up again but I managed it and stored my belongings in a corner of the cave
Then I set out to explore the rest of the crack
It slanted down and then rose again to a small platform
After that it dropped in easy steps to the moor beyond the tower
If the Portuguese Jew had come here that was the way by which he had reached it for he would not have had the time to make my ascent
I went very cautiously for I felt I was on the eve of a big discovery
The platform was partly hidden from my end by a bend in the crack and it was more or less screened by an outlying bastion of the tower from the other side
Its surface was covered with fine powdery dust as were the steps beyond it
In some excitement I knelt down and examined it
Beyond doubt there was spoor here
I knew the Portuguese jews footmarks by this time and I made them out clearly especially in one corner
But there were other footsteps quite different
The one showed the rackets of rough country boots the others were from unnailed soles
Again I longed for Peter to make certain though I was pretty sure of my conclusions
The man I had followed had come here and he had not stayed long
Someone else had been here probably later for the unnailed shoes overlaid the rackets
The first man might have left a message for the second
Perhaps the second was that human presence of which I had been dimly conscious in the nighttime
I carefully removed all traces of my own footmarks and went back to my cave
My head was humming with my discovery
I remembered Gressons word to his friend Tomorrow night
As I read it the Portuguese Jew had taken a message from Gresson to someone and that someone had come from somewhere and picked it up
The message contained an assignation for this very night
I had found a point of observation for no one was likely to come near my cave which was reached from the moor by such a toilsome climb
There I should bivouac and see what the darkness brought forth
I remember reflecting on the amazing luck which had so far attended me
As I looked from my refuge at the blue haze of twilight creeping over the waters I felt my pulses quicken with a wild anticipation
Then I heard a sound below me and craned my neck round the edge of the tower
A man was climbing up the rock by the way I had come
CHAPTER SEVEN I Hear of the Wild Birds I saw an old green felt hat and below it lean tweedclad shoulders
Then I saw a knapsack with a stick slung through it as the owner wriggled his way on to a shelf
Presently he turned his face upward to judge the remaining distance
It was the face of a young man a face sallow and angular but now a little flushed with the days sun and the work of climbing
It was a face that I had first seen at Fosse Manor
I felt suddenly sick and heartsore
I dont know why but I had never really associated the intellectuals of Biggleswick with a business like this
None of them but Ivery and he was different
They had been silly and priggish but no more  I would have taken my oath on it
Yet here was one of them engaged in black treason against his native land
Something began to beat in my temples when I remembered that Mary and this man had been friends that he had held her hand and called her by her Christian name
My first impulse was to wait till he got up and then pitch him down among the boulders and let his German accomplices puzzle over his broken neck
With difficulty I kept down that tide of fury
I had my duty to do and to keep on terms with this man was part of it
I had to convince him that I was an accomplice and that might not be easy
I leaned over the edge and as he got to his feet on the ledge above the boilerplates I whistled so that he turned his face to me
Hullo WakeI said
He started stared for a second and recognized me
He did not seem overpleased to see me
Brand
he cried
How did you get here
He swung himself up beside me straightened his back and unbuckled his knapsack
I thought this was my own private sanctuary and that nobody knew it but me
Have you spotted the cave
Its the best bedroom in Skye
His tone was as usual rather acid
That little hammer was beating in my head
I longed to get my hands on his throat and choke the smug treason in him
But I kept my mind fixed on one purpose  to persuade him that I shared his secret and was on his side
His offhand selfpossession seemed only the clever screen of the surprised conspirator who was hunting for a plan
We entered the cave and he flung his pack into a corner
Last time I was here he said I covered the floor with heather
We must get some more if we would sleep soft
In the twilight he was a dim figure but he seemed a new man from the one I had last seen in the Moot Hall at Biggleswick
There was a wiry vigour in his body and a purpose in his face
What a fool I had been to set him down as no more than a conceited fidneur
He went out to the shelf again and sniffed the fresh evening
There was a wonderful red sky in the west but in the crevice the shades had fallen and only the bright patches at either end told of the sunset
Wake I said you and I have to understand each other
Im a friend of Ivery and I know the meaning of this place
I discovered it by accident but I want you to know that Im heart and soul with you
You may trust me in tonights job as if I were Ivery himself
He swung round and looked at me sharply
His eyes were hot again as I remembered them at our first meeting
What do you mean
How much do you know
The hammer was going hard in my forehead and I had to pull myself together to answer
I know that at the end of this crack a message was left last night and that someone came out of the sea and picked it up
That someone is coming again when darkness falls and there will be another message
He had turned his head away
You are talking nonsense
No submarine could land on this coast
I could see that he was trying me
This morning I said I swam in the deepwater inlet below us
It is the most perfect submarine shelter in Britain
He still kept his face from me looking the way he had come
For a moment he was silent and then he spoke in the bitter drawling voice which had annoyed me at Fosse Manor
How do you reconcile this business with your principles Mr Brand
You were always a patriot I remember though you didnt see eye to eye with the Government
It was not quite what I expected and I was unready
I stammered in my reply
Its because I am a patriot that I want peace
I think that 
I mean  Therefore you are willing to help the enemy to win
They have already won
I want that recognized and the end hurried on
I was getting my mind clearer and continued fluently
The longer the war lasts the worse this country is ruined
We must make the people realize the truth and  But he swung round suddenly his eyes blazing
You blackguard
he cried you damnable blackguard
And he flung himself on me like a wildcat
I had got my answer
He did not believe me he knew me for a spy and he was determined to do me in
We were beyond finesse now and back at the old barbaric game
It was his life or mine
The hammer beat furiously in my head as we closed and a fierce satisfaction rose in my heart
He never had a chance for though he was in good trim and had the light wiry figure of the mountaineer he hadnt a quarter of my muscular strength
Besides he was wrongly placed for he had the outside station
Had he been on the inside he might have toppled me over the edge by his sudden assault
As it was I grappled him and forced him to the ground squeezing the breath out of his body in the process
I must have hurt him considerably but he never gave a cry
With a good deal of trouble I lashed his hands behind his back with the belt of my waterproof carried him inside the cave and laid him in the dark end of it
Then I tied his feet with the strap of his own knapsack
I would have to gag him but that could wait
I had still to contrive a plan of action for the night for I did not know what part he had been meant to play in it
He might be the messenger instead of the Portuguese Jew in which case he would have papers about his person
If he knew of the cave others might have the same knowledge and I had better shift him before they came
I looked at my wristwatch and the luminous dial showed that the hour was half past nine
Then I noticed that the bundle in the corner was sobbing
It was a horrid sound and it worried me
I had a little pocket electric torch and I flashed it on Wakes face
If he was crying it was with dry eyes
What are you going to do with me
he asked
That depends I said grimly
Well Im ready
I may be a poor creature but Im damned if Im afraid of you or anything like you
That was a brave thing to say for it was a lie his teeth were chattering
Im ready for a deal I said
You wont get it was his answer
Cut my throat if you mean to but for Gods sake dont insult me 
I choke when I think about you
You come to us and we welcome you and receive you in our houses and tell you our inmost thoughts and all the time youre a bloody traitor
You want to sell us to Germany
You may win now but by God
your time will come
That is my last word to you  you swine
The hammer stopped beating in my head
I saw myself suddenly as a blind preposterous fool
I strode over to Wake and he shut his eyes as if he expected a blow
Instead I unbuckled the straps which held his legs and arms
Wake old fellow I said Im the worst kind of idiot
Ill eat all the dirt you want
Ill give you leave to knock me black and blue and I wont lift a hand
But not now
Now weve another job on hand
Man were on the same side and I never knew it
Its too bad a case for apologies but if its any consolation to you I feel the lowest dog in Europe at this moment
He was sitting up rubbing his bruised shoulders
What do you mean
he asked hoarsely
I mean that you and I are allies
My names not Brand
Im a soldier  a general if you want to know
I went to Biggleswick under orders and I came chasing up here on the same job
Iverys the biggest German agent in Britain and Im after him
Ive struck his communication lines and this very night please God well get the last clue to the riddle
Do you hear
Were in this business together and youve got to lend a hand
I told him briefly the story of Gresson and how I had tracked his man here
As I talked we ate our supper and I wish I could have watched Wakes face
He asked questions for he wasnt convinced in a hurry
I think it was my mention of Mary Lamington that did the trick
I dont know why but that seemed to satisfy him
But he wasnt going to give himself away
You may count on me he said for this is black blackguardly treason
But you know my politics and I dont change them for this
Im more against your accursed war than ever now that I know what war involves
Righto I said Im a pacifist myself
You wont get any heroics about war from me
Im all for peace but weve got to down those devils first
It wasnt safe for either of us to stick in that cave so we cleared away the marks of our occupation and hid our packs in a deep crevice on the rock
Wake announced his intention of climbing the tower while there was still a faint afterglow of light
Its broad on the top and I can keep a watch out to sea if any light shows
Ive been up it before
I found the way two years ago
No I wont fall asleep and tumble off
I slept most of the afternoon on the top of Sgurr Vhiconnich and Im as wakeful as a bat now
I watched him shin up the face of the tower and admired greatly the speed and neatness with which he climbed
Then I followed the crevice southward to the hollow just below the platform where I had found the footmarks
There was a big boulder there which partly shut off the view of it from the direction of our cave
The place was perfect for my purpose for between the boulder and the wall of the tower was a narrow gap through which I could hear all that passed on the platform
I found a stance where I could rest in comfort and keep an eye through the crack on what happened beyond
There was still a faint light on the platform but soon that disappeared and black darkness settled down on the hills
It was the dark of the moon and as had happened the night before a thin wrack blew over the sky hiding the stars
The place was very still though now and then would come the cry of a bird from the crags that beetled above me and from the shore the pipe of a tern or oystercatcher
An owl hooted from somewhere up on the tower
That I reckoned was Wake so I hooted back and was answered
I unbuckled my wristwatch and pocketed it lest its luminous dial should betray me and I noticed that the hour was close on eleven
I had already removed my shoes and my jacket was buttoned at the collar so as to show no shirt
I did not think that the coming visitor would trouble to explore the crevice beyond the platform but I wanted to be prepared for emergencies
Then followed an hour of waiting
I felt wonderfully cheered and exhilarated for Wake had restored my confidence in human nature
In that eerie place we were wrapped round with mystery like a fog
Some unknown figure was coming out of the sea the emissary of that Power we had been at grips with for three years
It was as if the war had just made contact with our own shores and never not even when I was alone in the South German forest had I felt so much the sport of a whimsical fate
I only wished Peter could have been with me
And so my thoughts fled to Peter in his prison camp and I longed for another sight of my old friend as a girl longs for her lover
Then I heard the hoot of an owl and presently the sound of careful steps fell on my ear
I could see nothing but I guessed it was the Portuguese Jew for I could hear the grinding of heavily nailed boots on the gritty rock
The figure was very quiet
It appeared to be sitting down and then it rose and fumbled with the wall of the tower just beyond the boulder behind which I sheltered
It seemed to move a stone and to replace it
After that came silence and then once more the hoot of an owl
There were steps on the rock staircase the steps of a man who did not know the road well and stumbled a little
Also they were the steps of one without nails in his boots
They reached the platform and someone spoke
It was the Portuguese Jew and he spoke in good German
Die vogelein schweigen im Walde he said
The answer came from a clear authoritative voice
Warte nur balde ruhest du auch
Clearly some kind of password for sane men dont talk about little birds in that kind of situation
It sounded to me like indifferent poetry
Then followed a conversation in low tones of which I only caught odd phrases
I heard two names  Chelius and what sounded like a Dutch word Bommaerts
Then to my joy I caught Effenbein and when uttered it seemed to be followed by a laugh
I heard too a phrase several times repeated which seemed to me to be pure gibberish  Die Stubenvogel verstehn
It was spoken by the man from the sea
And then the word Wildvogel
The pair seemed demented about birds
For a second an electric torch was flashed in the shelter of the rock and I could see a tanned bearded face looking at some papers
The light disappeared and again the Portuguese Jew was fumbling with the stones at the base of the tower
To my joy he was close to my crack and I could hear every word
You cannot come here very often he said and it may be hard to arrange a meeting
See therefore the place I have made to put the Viageffutter
When I get a chance I will come here and you will come also when you are able
Often there will be nothing but sometimes there will be much
My luck was clearly in and my exultation made me careless
A stone on which a foot rested slipped and though I checked myself at once the confounded thing rolled down into the hollow making a great clatter
I plastered myself in the embrasure of the rock and waited with a beating heart
The place was pitch dark but they had an electric torch and if they once flashed it on me I was gone
I heard them leave the platform and climb down into the hollow
There they stood listening while I held my breath
Then I heard Nix mein freund and the two went back the naval officers boots slipping on the gravel
They did not leave the platform together
The man from the sea bade a short farewell to the Portuguese Jew listening I thought impatiently to his final message as if eager to be gone
It was a good halfhour before the latter took himself off and I heard the sound of his nailed boots die away as he reached the heather of the moor
I waited a little longer and then crawled back to the cave
The owl hooted and presently Wake descended lightly beside me he must have known every foothold and handhold by heart to do the job in that inky blackness
I remember that he asked no question of me but he used language rare on the lips of conscientious objectors about the men who had lately been in the crevice
We who four hours earlier had been at death grips now curled up on the hard floor like two tired dogs and fell sound asleep
I woke to find Wake in a thundering bad temper
The thing he remembered most about the night before was our scrap and the gross way I had insulted him
I didnt blame him for if any man had taken me for a German spy I would have been out for his blood and it was no good explaining that he had given me grounds for suspicion
He was as touchy about his blessed principles as an old maid about her age
I was feeling rather extra buckish myself and that didnt improve matters
His face was like a gargoyle as we went down to the beach to bathe so I held my tongue
He was chewing the cud of his wounded pride
But the salt water cleared out the dregs of his distemper
You couldnt be peevish swimming in that jolly shining sea
We raced each other away beyond the inlet to the outer water which a brisk morning breeze was curling
Then back to a promontory of heather where the first beams of the sun coming over the Coolin dried our skins
He sat hunched up staring at the mountains while I prospected the rocks at the edge
Out in the Minch two destroyers were hurrying southward and I wondered where in that waste of blue was the craft which had come here in the night watches
I found the spoor of the man from the sea quite fresh on a patch of gravel above the tidemark
Theres our friend of the night I said
I believe the whole thing was a whimsy said Wake his eyes on the chimneys of Sgurr Dearg
They were only two natives  poachers perhaps or tinkers
They dont speak German in these parts
It was Gaelic probably
What do you make of this then
and I quoted the stuff about birds with which they had greeted each other
Wake looked interested
Thats Uber allen Gipfeln
Have you ever read Goethe
Never a word
And what do you make of that
I pointed to a flat rock below tidemark covered with a tangle of seaweed
It was of a softer stone than the hard stuff in the hills and somebody had scraped off half the seaweed and a slice of the side
That wasnt done yesterday morning for I had my bath here
Wake got up and examined the place
He nosed about in the crannies of the rocks lining the inlet and got into the water again to explore better
When he joined me he was smiling
I apologize for my scepticism he said
Theres been some petroldriven craft here in the night
I can smell it for Ive a nose like a retriever
I daresay youre on the right track
Anyhow though you seem to know a bit about German you could scarcely invent immortal poetry
We took our belongings to a green crook of the burn and made a very good breakfast
Wake had nothing in his pack but plasmon biscuits and raisins for that he said was his mountaineering provender but he was not averse to sampling my tinned stuff
He was a differentsized fellow out in the hills from the anaemic intellectual of Biggleswick
He had forgotten his beastly selfconsciousness and spoke of his hobby with a serious passion
It seemed he had scrambled about everywhere in Europe from the Caucasus to the Pyrenees
I could see he must be good at the job for he didnt brag of his exploits
It was the mountains that he loved not wriggling his body up hard places
The Coolin he said were his favourites for on some of them you could get two thousand feet of good rock
We got our glasses on the face of Sgurr Alasdair and he sketched out for me various ways of getting to its grim summit
The Coolin and the Dolomites for him for he had grown tired of the Chamonix aiguilles
I remember he described with tremendous gusto the joys of early dawn in Tyrol when you ascended through acres of flowery meadows to a tooth of clean white limestone against a clean blue sky
He spoke too of the little wild hills in the Bavarian Wettersteingebirge and of a guide he had picked up there and trained to the job
They called him Sebastian Buchwieser
He was the jolliest boy you ever saw and as clever on crags as a chamois
He is probably dead by now dead in a filthy jaeger battalion
Thats you and your accursed war
Well weve got to get busy and end it in the right way I said
And youve got to help my lad
He was a good draughtsman and with his assistance I drew a rough map of the crevice where we had roosted for the night giving its bearings carefully in relation to the burn and the sea
Then I wrote down all the details about Gresson and the Portuguese Jew and described the latter in minute detail
I described too most precisely the cache where it had been arranged that the messages should be placed
That finished my stock of paper and I left the record of the oddments overheard of the conversation for a later time
I put the thing in an old leather cigarettecase I possessed and handed it to Wake
Youve got to go straight off to the Kyle and not waste any time on the way
Nobody suspects you so you can travel any road you please
When you get there you ask for Mr Andrew Amos who has some Government job in the neighbourhood
Give him that paper from me
Hell know what to do with it all right
Tell him Ill get somehow to the Kyle before midday the day after tomorrow
I must cover my tracks a bit so I cant come with you and I want that thing in his hands just as fast as your legs will take you
If anyone tries to steal it from you for Gods sake eat it
You can see for yourself that its devilish important
I shall be back in England in three days he said
Any message for your other friends
Forget all about me
You never saw me here
Im still Brand the amiable colonial studying social movements
If you meet Ivery say you heard of me on the Clyde deep in sedition
But if you see Miss Lamington you can tell her Im past the Hill Difficulty
Im coming back as soon as God will let me and Im going to drop right into the Biggleswick push
Only this time Ill be a little more advanced in my views  You neednt get cross
Im not saying anything against your principles
The main point is that we both hate dirty treason
He put the case in his waistcoat pocket
Ill go round Garsbheinn he said and over by Camasunary
Ill be at the Kyle long before evening
I meant anyhow to sleep at Broadford tonight  Goodbye Brand for Ive forgotten your proper name
Youre not a bad fellow but youve landed me in melodrama for the first time in my sober existence
I have a grudge against you for mixing up the Coolin with a shilling shocker
Youve spoiled their sanctity
Youve the wrong notion of romance I said
Why man last night for an hour you were in the front line  the place where the enemy forces touch our own
You were over the top  you were in Nomansland
He laughed
That is one way to look at it and then he stalked off and I watched his lean figure till it was round the turn of the hill
All that morning I smoked peacefully by the burn and let my thoughts wander over the whole business
I had got precisely what Blenkiron wanted a post office for the enemy
It would need careful handling but I could see the juiciest lies passing that way to the Grosses Haupiquartier
Yet I had an ugly feeling at the back of my head that it had been all too easy and that Ivery was not the man to be duped in this way for long
That set me thinking about the queer talk on the crevice
The poetry stuff I dismissed as the ordinary password probably changed every time
But who were Chelius and Bommaerts and what in the name of goodness were the Wild Birds and the Cage Birds
Twice in the past three years I had had two such riddles to solve  Scudders scribble in his pocket book and Harry Bullivants three words
I remembered how it had only been by constant chewing at them that I had got a sort of meaning and I wondered if fate would some day expound this puzzle also
Meantime I had to get back to London as inconspicuously as I had come
It might take some doing for the police who had been active in Morvern might be still on the track and it was essential that I should keep out of trouble and give no hint to Gresson and his friends that I had been so far north
However that was for Amos to advise me on and about noon I picked up my waterproof with its bursting pockets and set off on a long detour up the coast
All that blessed day I scarcely met a soul
I passed a distillery which seemed to have quit business and in the evening came to a little town on the sea where I had a bed and supper in a superior kind of publichouse
Next day I struck southward along the coast and had two experiences of interest
I had a good look at Ranna and observed that the Tobermory was no longer there
Gresson had only waited to get his job finished he could probably twist the old captain any way he wanted
The second was that at the door of a village smithy I saw the back of the Portuguese Jew
He was talking Gaelic this time  good Gaelic it sounded and in that knot of idlers he would have passed for the ordinariest kind of gillie
He did not see me and I had no desire to give him the chance for I had an odd feeling that the day might come when it would be good for us to meet as strangers
That night I put up boldly in the inn at Broadford where they fed me nobly on fresh seatrout and I first tasted an excellent liqueur made of honey and whisky
Next morning I was early afoot and well before midday was in sight of the narrows of the Kyle and the two little stone clachans which face each other across the strip of sea
About two miles from the place at a turn of the road I came upon a farmers gig drawn up by the wayside with the horse cropping the moorland grass
A man sat on the bank smoking with his left arm hooked in the reins
He was an oldish man with a short square figure and a woollen comforter enveloped his throat
CHAPTER EIGHT The Adventures of a Bagman Yere punctual to time Mr Brand said the voice of Amos
But losh
man what have ye done to your breeks
And your buits
Yere no just very respectable in your appearance
I wasnt
The confounded rocks of the Coolin had left their mark on my shoes which moreover had not been cleaned for a week and the same hills had rent my jacket at the shoulders and torn my trousers above the right knee and stained every part of my apparel with peat and lichen
I cast myself on the bank beside Amos and lit my pipe
Did you get my message
I asked
Ay
Its gone on by a sure hand to the destination we ken of
Yeve managed well Mr Brand but I wish ye were back in London
He sucked at his pipe and the shaggy brows were pulled so low as to hide the wary eyes
Then he proceeded to think aloud
Ye canna go back by Mallaig
I dont just understand why but theyre lookin for you down that line
Its a vexatious business when your friends meanin the polis are doing their best to upset your plans and you no able to enlighten them
I could send word to the Chief Constable and get ye through to London without a stop like a load of fish from Aiberdeen but that would be spoilin the fine character yeve been at such pains to construct
Na na
Ye maun take the risk and travel by Muirtown without ony creedentials
It cant be a very big risk I interpolated
Im no so sure
Gressons left the Tobermory
He went by here yesterday on the Mallaig boat and there was a wee blackavised man with him that got out at the Kyle
Hes there still stoppin at the hotel
They ca him Linklater and he travels in whisky
I dont like the looks of him
But Gresson does not suspect me
Maybe no
But ye wouldna like him to see ye hereaways
Yon gentry dont leave muckle to chance
Be very certain that every man in Gressons lot kens all about ye and has your description down to the mole on your chin
Then theyve got it wrong I replied
I was speakin feeguratively said Amos
I was considerin your case the feck of yesterday and Ive brought the best I could do for ye in the gig
I wish ye were more respectable clad but a good topcoat will hide defeecencies
From behind the gigs seat he pulled out an ancient Gladstone bag and revealed its contents
There was a bowler of a vulgar and antiquated style there was a readymade overcoat of some dark cloth of the kind that a clerk wears on the road to the office there was a pair of detachable celluloid cuffs and there was a linen collar and dickie
Also there was a small handcase such as bagmen carry on their rounds
Thats your luggage said Amos with pride
That wee bags full of samples
Yell mind I took the precaution of measurin ye in Glasgow so the thingsll fit
Yeve got a new name Mr Brand and Ive taken a room for ye in the hotel on the strength of it
Yere Archibald McCaskie and yere travellin for the firm o Todd Sons  Brothers of Edinburgh
Ye ken the folk
They publish wee releegious books that yeve bin trying to sell for Sabbathschool prizes to the Free Kirk ministers in Skye
The notion amused Amos and he relapsed into the sombre chuckle which with him did duty for a laugh
I put my hat and waterproof in the bag and donned the bowler and the topcoat
They fitted fairly well
Likewise the cuffs and collar though here I struck a snag for I had lost my scarf somewhere in the Coolin and Amos pelicanlike had to surrender the rusty black tie which adorned his own person
It was a queer rig and I felt like nothing on earth in it but Amos was satisfied
Mr McCaskie sir he said yere the very model of a publishers traveller
Yed better learn a few biographical details which yeve maybe forgotten
Yere an Edinburgh man but ye were some years in London which explains the way ye speak
Ye bide at 6 Russell Street off the Meadows and yere an elder in the Nethergate UF
Kirk
Have ye ony special taste ye could lead the crack on to if yere engaged in conversation
I suggested the English classics
And very suitable
Ye can try poalitics too
Yed better be a Freetrader but convertit by Lloyd George
Thats a common case and yell need to be byordinar common 
If I was you I would daunder about here for a bit and no arrive at your hotel till after dark
Then ye can have your supper and gang to bed
The Muirtown train leaves at halfseven in the morning  Na ye cant come with me
It wouldna do for us to be seen thegither
If I meet ye in the street Ill never let on I know ye
Amos climbed into the gig and jolted off home
I went down to the shore and sat among the rocks finishing about teatime the remains of my provisions
In the mellow gloaming I strolled into the clachan and got a boat to put me over to the inn
It proved to be a comfortable place with a motherly old landlady who showed me to my room and promised ham and eggs and cold salmon for supper
After a good wash which I needed and an honest attempt to make my clothes presentable I descended to the meal in a coffee room lit by a single dim parafin lamp
The food was excellent and as I ate my spirits rose
In two days I should be back in London beside Blenkiron and somewhere within a days journey of Mary
I could picture no scene now without thinking how Mary fitted into it
For her sake I held Biggleswick delectable because I had seen her there
I wasnt sure if this was love but it was something I had never dreamed of before something which I now hugged the thought of
It made the whole earth rosy and golden for me and life so well worth living that I felt like a miser towards the days to come
I had about finished supper when I was joined by another guest
Seen in the light of that infamous lamp he seemed a small alert fellow with a bushy black moustache and black hair parted in the middle
He had fed already and appeared to be hungering for human society
In three minutes he had told me that he had come down from Portree and was on his way to Leith
A minute later he had whipped out a card on which I read J
J Linklater and in the corner the name of Hatherwick Bros His accent betrayed that he hailed from the west
Ive been up among the distilleries he informed me
Its a poor business distillin in these times wi the teetotallers yowlin about the nations shame and the way to lose the war
Im a temperate man mysel but I would think shame to spile decent folks business
If the Government want to stop the drink let them buy us out
Theyve permitted us to invest good money in the trade and they must see that we get it back
The other way will wreck public credit
Thats what I say
Supposin some Labour Government takes the notion that soaps bad for the nation
Are they goin to shut up Port Sunlight
Or good clothes
Or lum hats
Theres no end to their daftness if they once start on that track
A lawfu trades a lawfu trade says I and its contrary to public policy to pit it at the mercy of wheen cranks
Dye no agree sir
By the way I havena got your name
I told him and he rambled on
Were blenders and do a very highclass business mostly foreign
The wars hit us wi our export trade of course but were no as bad as some
Whats your line Mr McCaskie
When he heard he was keenly interested
Dye say so
Yere from Todds
Man I was in the book business mysel till I changed it for something a wee bit more lucrative
I was on the road for three years for Andrew Matheson
Ye ken the name  Paternoster Row  Ive forgotten the number
I had a kind of ambition to start a booksellin shop of my own and to make Linklater o Paisley a big name in the trade
But I got the offer from Hatherwicks and I was wantin to get married so filthy lucre won the day
And Im no sorry I changed
If it hadna been for this war I would have been makin four figures with my salary and commissions  My pipes out
Have you one of those rare and valuable curiosities called a spunk Mr McCaskie
He was a merry little grig of a man and he babbled on till I announced my intention of going to bed
If this was Amoss bagman who had been seen in company with Gresson I understood how idle may be the suspicions of a clever man
He had probably foregathered with Gresson on the Skye boat and wearied that saturnine soul with his cackle
I was up betimes paid my bill ate a breakfast of porridge and fresh haddock and walked the few hundred yards to the station
It was a warm thick morning with no sun visible and the Skye hills misty to their base
The three coaches on the little train were nearly filled when I had bought my ticket and I selected a thirdclass smoking carriage which held four soldiers returning from leave
The train was already moving when a late passenger hurried along the platform and clambered in beside me
A cheery Mornin Mr McCaskie revealed my fellow guest at the hotel
We jolted away from the coast up a broad glen and then on to a wide expanse of bog with big hills showing towards the north
It was a drowsy day and in that atmosphere of shag and crowded humanity I felt my eyes closing
I had a short nap and woke to find that Mr Linklater had changed his seat and was now beside me
Well no get a Scotsman till Muirtown he said
Have ye nothing in your samples ye could give me to read
I had forgotten about the samples
I opened the case and found the oddest collection of little books all in gay bindings
Some were religious with names like Dew of Hermon and Cool Siloam some were innocent narratives How Tommy saved his Pennies A Missionary Child in China and Little Susie and her Uncle
There was a Life of David Livingstone a childs book on seashells and a richly gilt edition of the poems of one James Montgomery
I offered the selection to Mr Linklater who grinned and chose the Missionary Child
Its not the reading Im accustomed to he said
I like strong meat  Hall Caine and Jack London
By the way how dye square this business of yours wi the booksellers
When I was in Mathesons there would have been trouble if we had dealt direct wi the public like you
The confounded fellow started to talk about the details of the book trade of which I knew nothing
He wanted to know on what terms we sold juveniles and what discount we gave the big wholesalers and what class of book we put out on sale
I didnt understand a word of his jargon and I must have given myself away badly for he asked me questions about firms of which I had never heard and I had to make some kind of answer
I told myself that the donkey was harmless and that his opinion of me mattered nothing but as soon as I decently could I pretended to be absorbed in the Pilgrims Progress a gaudy copy of which was among the samples
It opened at the episode of Christian and Hopeful in the Enchanted Ground and in that stuffy carriage I presently followed the example of Heedless and TooBold and fell sound asleep
I was awakened by the train rumbling over the points of a little moorland junction
Sunk in a pleasing lethargy I sat with my eyes closed and then covertly took a glance at my companion
He had abandoned the Missionary Child and was reading a little dun coloured book and marking passages with a pencil
His face was absorbed and it was a new face not the vacant goodhumoured look of the garrulous bagman but something shrewd purposeful and formidable
I remained hunched up as if still sleeping and tried to see what the book was
But my eyes good as they are could make out nothing of the text or title except that I had a very strong impression that that book was not written in the English tongue
I woke abruptly and leaned over to him
Quick as lightning he slid his pencil up his sleeve and turned on me with a fatuous smile
What dye make o this Mr McCaskie
Its a wee book I picked up at a roup along with fifty others
I paid five shillings for the lot
It looks like Gairman but in my young days they didna teach us foreign languages
I took the thing and turned over the pages trying to keep any sign of intelligence out of my face
It was German right enough a little manual of hydrography with no publishers name on it
It had the look of the kind of textbook a Government department might issue to its officials
I handed it back
Its either German or Dutch
Im not much of a scholar barring a little French and the Latin I got at Heriots Hospital 
This is an awful slow train Mr Linklater
The soldiers were playing nap and the bagman proposed a game of cards
I remembered in time that I was an elder in the Nethergate UF
Church and refused with some asperity
After that I shut my eyes again for I wanted to think out this new phenomenon
The fellow knew German  that was clear
He had also been seen in Gressons company
I didnt believe he suspected me though I suspected him profoundly
It was my business to keep strictly to my part and give him no cause to doubt me
He was clearly practising his own part on me and I must appear to take him literally on his professions
So presently I woke up and engaged him in a disputatious conversation about the morality of selling strong liquors
He responded readily and put the case for alcohol with much point and vehemence
The discussion interested the soldiers and one of them to show he was on Linklaters side produced a flask and offered him a drink
I concluded by observing morosely that the bagman had been a better man when he peddled books for Alexander Matheson and that put the closure on the business
That train was a record
It stopped at every station and in the afternoon it simply got tired and sat down in the middle of a moor and reflected for an hour
I stuck my head out of the window now and then and smelt the rooty fragrance of bogs and when we halted on a bridge I watched the trout in the pools of the brown river
Then I slept and smoked alternately and began to get furiously hungry
Once I woke to hear the soldiers discussing the war
There was an argument between a lancecorporal in the Camerons and a sapper private about some trivial incident on the Somme
I tell ye I was there said the Cameron
We were relievin the Black Watch and Fritz was shelling the road and we didna get up to the line till one oclock in the mornin
Frae Frickout Circus to the south end o the High Wood is every bit o five mile
Not abune three said the sapper dogmatically
Man Ive trampit it
Same here
I took up wire every nicht for a week
The Cameron looked moodily round the company
I wish there was anither man here that kent the place
He wad bear me out
These boys are no good for they didna join till later
I tell ye its five mile
Three said the sapper
Tempers were rising for each of the disputants felt his veracity assailed
It was too hot for a quarrel and I was so drowsy that I was heedless
Shut up you fools I said
The distance is six kilometres so youre both wrong
My tone was so familiar to the men that it stopped the wrangle but it was not the tone of a publishers traveller
Mr Linklater cocked his ears
Whats a kilometre Mr McCaskie
he asked blandly
Multiply by five and divide by eight and you get the miles
I was on my guard now and told a long story of a nephew who had been killed on the Somme and how I had corresponded with the War Office about his case
Besides I said Im a great student o the newspapers and Ive read all the books about the war
Its a difficult time this for us all and if you can take a serious interest in the campaign it helps a lot
I mean working out the places on the map and reading Haigs dispatches
Just so he said dryly and I thought he watched me with an odd look in his eyes
A fresh idea possessed me
This man had been in Gressons company he knew German he was obviously something very different from what he professed to be
What if he were in the employ of our own Secret Service
I had appeared out of the void at the Kyle and I had made but a poor appearance as a bagman showing no knowledge of my own trade
I was in an area interdicted to the ordinary public and he had good reason to keep an eye on my movements
He was going south and so was I clearly we must somehow part company
We change at Muirtown dont we
I asked
When does the train for the south leave
He consulted a pocket timetable
Tenthirtythree
Theres generally four hours to wait for were due in at sixfifteen
But this auld hearse will be lucky if its in by nine
His forecast was correct
We rumbled out of the hills into haughlands and caught a glimpse of the North Sea
Then we were hung up while a long goods train passed down the line
It was almost dark when at last we crawled into Muirtown station and disgorged our load of hot and weary soldiery
I bade an ostentatious farewell to Linklater
Very pleased to have met you
Ill see you later on the Edinburgh train
Im for a walk to stretch my legs and a bite o supper
I was very determined that the tenthirty for the south should leave without me
My notion was to get a bed and a meal in some secluded inn and walk out next morning and pick up a slow train down the line
Linklater had disappeared towards the guards van to find his luggage and the soldiers were sitting on their packs with that air of being utterly and finally lost and neglected which characterizes the British fightingman on a journey
I gave up my ticket and since I had come off a northern train walked unhindered into the town
It was market night and the streets were crowded
Bluejackets from the Fleet countryfolk in to shop and every kind of military detail thronged the pavements
Fishhawkers were crying their wares and there was a tatterdemalion piper making the night hideous at a corner
I took a tortuous route and finally fixed on a modestlooking publichouse in a back street
When I inquired for a room I could find no one in authority but a slatternly girl informed me that there was one vacant bed and that I could have ham and eggs in the bar
So after hitting my head violently against a cross beam I stumbled down some steps and entered a frowsty little place smelling of spilt beer and stale tobacco
The promised ham and eggs proved impossible  there were no eggs to be had in Muirtown that night  but I was given cold mutton and a pint of indifferent ale
There was nobody in the place but two farmers drinking hot whisky and water and discussing with sombre interest the rise in the price of feedingstuffs
I ate my supper and was just preparing to find the whereabouts of my bedroom when through the street door there entered a dozen soldiers
In a second the quiet place became a babel
The men were strictly sober but they were in that temper of friendliness which demands a libation of some kind
One was prepared to stand treat he was the leader of the lot and it was to celebrate the end of his leave that he was entertaining his pals
From where I sat I could not see him but his voice was dominant
Whats your fancy jock
Beer for you Andra
A pint and a dram for me
This is better than vongblong and vongrooge Davie
Man when Im sittin in those estamints as they ca them I often long for a guid Scots public
The voice was familiar
I shifted my seat to get a view of the speaker and then I hastily drew back
It was the Scots Fusilier I had clipped on the jaw in defending Gresson after the Glasgow meeting
But by a strange fatality he had caught sight of me
Whaes that i the corner
he cried leaving the bar to stare at me
Now it is a queer thing but if you have once fought with a man though only for a few seconds you remember his face and the scrap in Glasgow had been under a lamp
The jock recognized me well enough
By God
he cried if this is no a bit o luck
Boys heres the man I feucht wi in Glesca
Ye mind I telled ye about it
He laid me oot and its my turn to do the same wi him
I had a notion I was gaun to mak a nicht ot
Theres naebody can hit Geordie Hamilton without Geordie gettin his ain back some day
Get up man for Im gaun to knock the heid off ye
I duly got up and with the best composure I could muster looked him in the face
Youre mistaken my friend
I never clapped eyes on you before and I never was in Glasgow in my life
Thats a damned lee said the Fusilier
Yere the man and if yere no yere like enough him to need a hidin
Confound your nonsense
I said
Ive no quarrel with you and Ive better things to do than be scrapping with a stranger in a publichouse
Have ye sae
Well Ill learn ye better
Im gaun to hit ye and then yell hae to fecht whether ye want it or no
Tam haud my jacket and see that my drinks no skailed
This was an infernal nuisance for a row here would bring in the police and my dubious position would be laid bare
I thought of putting up a fight for I was certain I could lay out the jock a second time but the worst of that was that I did not know where the thing would end
I might have to fight the lot of them and that meant a noble public shindy
I did my best to speak my opponent fair
I said we were all good friends and offered to stand drinks for the party
But the Fusiliers blood was up and he was spoiling for a row ably abetted by his comrades
He had his tunic off now and was stamping in front of me with doubled fists
I did the best thing I could think of in the circumstances
My seat was close to the steps which led to the other part of the inn
I grabbed my hat darted up them and before they realized what I was doing had bolted the door behind me
I could hear pandemonium break loose in the bar
I slipped down a dark passage to another which ran at right angles to it and which seemed to connect the street door of the inn itself with the back premises
I could hear voices in the little hall and that stopped me short
One of them was Linklaters but he was not talking as Linklater had talked
He was speaking educated English
I heard another with a Scots accent which I took to be the landlords and a third which sounded like some superior sort of constables very prompt and official
I heard one phrase too from Linklater  He calls himself McCaskie
Then they stopped for the turmoil from the bar had reached the front door
The Fusilier and his friends were looking for me by the other entrance
The attention of the men in the hall was distracted and that gave me a chance
There was nothing for it but the back door
I slipped through it into a courtyard and almost tumbled over a tub of water
I planted the thing so that anyone coming that way would fall over it
A door led me into an empty stable and from that into a lane
It was all absurdly easy but as I started down the lane I heard a mighty row and the sound of angry voices
Someone had gone into the tub and I hoped it was Linklater
I had taken a liking to the Fusilier jock
There was the beginning of a moon somewhere but that lane was very dark
I ran to the left for on the right it looked like a culdesac
This brought me into a quiet road of twostoried cottages which showed at one end the lights of a street
So I took the other way for I wasnt going to have the whole population of Muirtown on the hueandcry after me
I came into a country lane and I also came into the van of the pursuit which must have taken a short cut
They shouted when they saw me but I had a small start and legged it down that road in the belief that I was making for open country
That was where I was wrong
The road took me round to the other side of the town and just when I was beginning to think I had a fair chance I saw before me the lights of a signalbox and a little to the left of it the lights of the station
In half an hours time the Edinburgh train would be leaving but I had made that impossible
Behind me I could hear the pursuers giving tongue like hound puppies for they had attracted some pretty drunken gentlemen to their party
I was badly puzzled where to turn when I noticed outside the station a long line of blurred lights which could only mean a train with the carriage blinds down
It had an engine attached and seemed to be waiting for the addition of a couple of trucks to start
It was a wild chance but the only one I saw
I scrambled across a piece of waste ground climbed an embankment and found myself on the metals
I ducked under the couplings and got on the far side of the train away from the enemy
Then simultaneously two things happened
I heard the yells of my pursuers a dozen yards off and the train jolted into motion
I jumped on the footboard and looked into an open window
The compartment was packed with troops six a side and two men sitting on the floor and the door was locked
I dived headforemost through the window and landed on the neck of a weary warrior who had just dropped off to sleep
While I was falling I made up my mind on my conduct
I must be intoxicated for I knew the infinite sympathy of the British soldier towards those thus overtaken
They pulled me to my feet and the man I had descended on rubbed his skull and blasphemously demanded explanations
Genlmen I hiccoughed I pologize
I was late for this blblighted train and I mus be in Einburgh morrow or Ill get the sack
I pologize
If Ive hurt my friends head Ill kiss it and make it well
At this there was a great laugh
Yed better accept Pete said one
Its the first time anybody ever offered to kiss your ugly heid
A man asked me who I was and I appeared to be searching for a cardcase
Losht I groaned
Losht and sos my wee bag and Ive bashed my po hat
Im an awful sight genlmen  an awful warning to be in time for trains
Im John Johnstone managing clerk to Messrs Watters Brown  Elphstone 923 Charltte Street Einburgh
Ive been up north seein my mamma
Ye should be in France said one man
Wisht I was but they wouldnt let me
Mr Johnstone they said yere no dam good
Yeve varicose veins and a bad heart they said
So I says Good mornin genlmen
Dont blame me if the countrys runed
Thats what I said
I had by this time occupied the only remaining space left on the floor
With the philosophy of their race the men had accepted my presence and were turning again to their own talk
The train had got up speed and as I judged it to be a special of some kind I looked for few stoppings
Moreover it was not a corridor carriage but one of the oldfashioned kind so I was safe for a time from the unwelcome attention of conductors
I stretched my legs below the seat rested my head against the knees of a brawny gunner and settled down to make the best of it
My reflections were not pleasant
I had got down too far below the surface and had the naked feeling you get in a dream when you think you have gone to the theatre in your nightgown
I had had three names in two days and as many characters
I felt as if I had no home or position anywhere and was only a stray dog with everybodys hand and foot against me
It was an ugly sensation and it was not redeemed by any acute fear or any knowledge of being mixed up in some desperate drama
I knew I could easily go on to Edinburgh and when the police made trouble as they would a wire to Scotland Yard would settle matters in a couple of hours
There wasnt a suspicion of bodily danger to restore my dignity
The worst that could happen would be that Ivery would hear of my being befriended by the authorities and the part I had settled to play would be impossible
He would certainly hear
I had the greatest respect for his intelligence service
Yet that was bad enough
So far I had done well
I had put Gresson off the scent
I had found out what Bullivant wanted to know and I had only to return unostentatiously to London to have won out on the game
I told myself all that but it didnt cheer my spirits
I was feeling mean and hunted and very cold about the feet
But I have a tough knuckle of obstinacy in me which makes me unwilling to give up a thing till I am fairly choked off it
The chances were badly against me
The Scottish police were actively interested in my movements and would be ready to welcome me at my journeys end
I had ruined my hat and my clothes as Amos had observed were not respectable
I had got rid of a fourdays beard the night before but had cut myself in the process and what with my weatherbeaten face and tangled hair looked liker a tinker than a decent bagman
I thought with longing of my portmanteau in the Pentland Hotel Edinburgh and the neat blue serge suit and the clean linen that reposed in it
It was no case for a subtle game for I held no cards
Still I was determined not to chuck in my hand till I was forced to
If the train stopped anywhere I would get out and trust to my own wits and the standing luck of the British Army for the rest
The chance came just after dawn when we halted at a little junction
I got up yawning and tried to open the door till I remembered it was locked
Thereupon I stuck my legs out of the window on the side away from the platform and was immediately seized upon by a sleepy Seaforth who thought I contemplated suicide
Let me go I said
Ill be back in a jiffy
Let him gang jock said another voice
Ye ken what a mans like when hes been on the bash
The cauld airll sober him
I was released and after some gymnastics dropped on the metals and made my way round the rear of the train
As I clambered on the platform it began to move and a face looked out of one of the back carriages
It was Linklater and he recognized me
He tried to get out but the door was promptly slammed by an indignant porter
I heard him protest and he kept his head out till the train went round the curve
That cooked my goose all right
He would wire to the police from the next station
Meantime in that clean bare chilly place there was only one traveller
He was a slim young man with a kitbag and a guncase
His clothes were beautiful a green Homburg hat a smart green tweed overcoat and boots as brightly polished as a horse chestnut
I caught his profile as he gave up his ticket and to my amazement I recognized it
The stationmaster looked askance at me as I presented myself dilapidated and dishevelled to the official gaze
I tried to speak in a tone of authority
Who is the man who has just gone out
Whaurs your ticket
I had no time to get one at Muirtown and as you see I have left my luggage behind me
Take it out of that pound and Ill come back for the change
I want to know if that was Sir Archibald Roylance
He looked suspiciously at the note
I think thats the name
Hes a captain up at the Fleein School
What was ye wantin with him
I charged through the bookingoffice and found my man about to enter a big grey motorcar
Archie I cried and beat him on the shoulders
He turned round sharply
What the devil 
Who are you
And then recognition crept into his face and he gave a joyous shout
My holy aunt
The General disguised as Charlie Chaplin
Can I drive you anywhere sir
CHAPTER NINE I Take the Wings of a Dove Drive me somewhere to breakfast Archie I said for Im perishing hungry
He and I got into the tonneau and the driver swung us out of the station road up a long incline of hill
Sir Archie had been one of my subalterns in the old Lennox Highlanders and had left us before the Somme to join the Flying Corps
I had heard that he had got his wings and had done well before Arras and was now training pilots at home
He had been a lighthearted youth who had endured a good deal of roughtonguing from me for his sins of omission
But it was the casual class of lad I was looking for now
I saw him steal amused glances at my appearance
Been seein a bit of life sir
he inquired respectfully
Im being hunted by the police I said
Dirty dogs
But dont worry sir well get you off all right
Ive been in the same fix myself
You can lie snug in my little log hut for that old image Gibbons wont blab
Or tell you what Ive got an aunt who lives near here and shes a bit of a sportsman
You can hide in her moated grange till the bobbies get tired
I think it was Archies calm acceptance of my position as natural and becoming that restored my good temper
He was far too well bred to ask what crime I had committed and I didnt propose to enlighten him much
But as we swung up the moorland road I let him know that I was serving the Government but that it was necessary that I should appear to be unauthenticated and that therefore I must dodge the police
He whistled his appreciation
Gad thats a deep game
Sort of camouflage
Speaking from my experience it is easy to overdo that kind of stunt
When I was at Misieux the French started out to camouflage the caravans where they keep their pigeons and they did it so damned well that the poor little birds couldnt hit em off and spent the night out
We entered the white gates of a big aerodrome skirted a forest of tents and huts and drew up at a shanty on the far confines of the place
The hour was half past four and the world was still asleep
Archie nodded towards one of the hangars from the mouth of which projected the propeller end of an aeroplane
Im by way of flyin that bus down to Farnton tomorrow he remarked
Its the new SharkGladas
Got a mouth like a tree
An idea flashed into my mind
Youre going this morning I said
How did you know
he exclaimed
Im due to go today but the grouse up in Caithness wanted shootin so badly that I decided to wangle another days leave
They cant expect a man to start for the south of England when hes just off a frowsy journey
All the same youre going to be a stout fellow and start in two hours time
And youre going to take me with you
He stared blankly and then burst into a roar of laughter
Youre the man to go tigershootin with
But what price my commandant
Hes not a bad chap but a trifle shaggy about the fetlocks
He wont appreciate the joke
He neednt know
He mustnt know
This is an affair between you and me till its finished
I promise you Ill make it all square with the Flying Corps
Get me down to Farnton before evening and youll have done a good piece of work for the country
Righto
Lets have a tub and a bit of breakfast and then Im your man
Ill tell them to get the bus ready
In Archies bedroom I washed and shaved and borrowed a green tweed cap and a brandnew Aquascutum
The latter covered the deficiencies of my raiment and when I commandeered a pair of gloves I felt almost respectable
Gibbons who seemed to be a jackofalltrades cooked us some bacon and an omelette and as he ate Archie yarned
In the battalion his conversation had been mostly of racemeetings and the forsaken delights of town but now he had forgotten all that and like every good airman I have ever known wallowed enthusiastically in shop
I have a deep respect for the Flying Corps but it is apt to change its jargon every month and its conversation is hard for the layman to follow
He was desperately keen about the war which he saw wholly from the viewpoint of the air
Arras to him was over before the infantry crossed the top and the tough bit of the Somme was October not September
He calculated that the big airfighting had not come along yet and all he hoped for was to be allowed out to France to have his share in it
Like all good airmen too he was very modest about himself
Ive done a bit of steeplechasin and huntin and Ive good hands for a horse so I can handle a bus fairly well
Its all a matter of hands you know
There aint half the risk of the infantry down below you and a million times the fun
jolly glad I changed sir
We talked of Peter and he put him about top
Voss he thought was the only Boche that could compare with him for he hadnt made up his mind about Lensch
The Frenchman Guynemer he ranked high but in a different way
I remember he had no respect for Richthofen and his celebrated circus
At six sharp we were ready to go
A couple of mechanics had got out the machine and Archie put on his coat and gloves and climbed into the pilots seat while I squeezed in behind in the observers place
The aerodrome was waking up but I saw no officers about
We were scarcely seated when Gibbons called our attention to a motorcar on the road and presently we heard a shout and saw men waving in our direction
Better get off my lad I said
These look like my friends
The engine started and the mechanics stood clear
As we taxied over the turf I looked back and saw several figures running in our direction
The next second we had left the bumpy earth for the smooth highroad of the air
I had flown several dozen times before generally over the enemy lines when I wanted to see for myself how the land lay
Then we had flown low and been nicely dusted by the Hun Archies not to speak of an occasional machinegun
But never till that hour had I realized the joy of a straight flight in a swift plane in perfect weather
Archie didnt lose time
Soon the hangars behind looked like a childs toys and the world ran away from us till it seemed like a great golden bowl spilling over with the quintessence of light
The air was cold and my hands numbed but I never felt them
As we throbbed and tore southward sometimes bumping in eddies sometimes swimming evenly in a stream of motionless ether my head and heart grew as light as a boys
I forgot all about the vexations of my job and saw only its joyful comedy
I didnt think that anything on earth could worry me again
Far to the left was a wedge of silver and beside it a cluster of toy houses
That must be Edinburgh where reposed my portmanteau and where a most efficient police force was now inquiring for me
At the thought I laughed so loud that Archie must have heard me
He turned round saw my grinning face and grinned back
Then he signalled to me to strap myself in
I obeyed and he proceeded to practise stunts  the loop the spinning nosedive and others I didnt know the names of
It was glorious fun and he handled his machine as a good rider coaxes a nervous horse over a stiff hurdle
He had that extra something in his blood that makes the great pilot
Presently the chessboard of green and brown had changed to a deep purple with faint silvery lines like veins in a rock
We were crossing the Border hills the place where I had legged it for weary days when I was mixed up in the Black Stone business
What a marvellous element was this air which took one far above the fatigues of humanity
Archie had done well to change
Peter had been the wise man
I felt a tremendous pity for my old friend hobbling about a German prisonyard when he had once flown a hawk
I reflected that I had wasted my life hitherto
And then I remembered that all this glory had only one use in war and that was to help the muddy British infantryman to down his Hun opponent
He was the fellow after all that decided battles and the thought comforted me
A great exhilaration is often the precursor of disaster and mine was to have a sudden downfall
It was getting on for noon and we were well into England  I guessed from the rivers we had passed that we were somewhere in the north of Yorkshire  when the machine began to make odd sounds and we bumped in perfectly calm patches of air
We dived and then climbed but the confounded thing kept sputtering
Archie passed back a slip of paper on which he had scribbled Engine conked
Must land at Micklegill
Very sorry
So we dropped to a lower elevation where we could see clearly the houses and roads and the long swelling ridges of a moorland country
I could never have found my way about but Archies practised eye knew every landmark
We were trundling along very slowly now and even I was soon able to pick up the hangars of a big aerodrome
We made Micklegill but only by the skin of our teeth
We were so low that the smoky chimneys of the city of Bradfield seven miles to the east were half hidden by a ridge of down
Archie achieved a clever descent in the lee of a belt of firs and got out full of imprecations against the Gladas engine
Ill go up to the camp and report he said and send mechanics down to tinker this darned gramophone
Youd better go for a walk sir
I dont want to answer questions about you till were ready to start
I reckon itll be an hours job
The cheerfulness I had acquired in the upper air still filled me
I sat down in a ditch as merry as a sandboy and lit a pipe
I was possessed by a boyish spirit of casual adventure and waited on the next turn of fortunes wheel with only a pleasant amusement
That turn was not long in coming
Archie appeared very breathless
Look here sir theres the deuce of a row up there
Theyve been wirin about you all over the country and they know youre with me
Theyve got the police and theyll have you in five minutes if you dont leg it
I lied like billyo and said I had never heard of you but theyre comin to see for themselves
For Gods sake get off  Youd better keep in cover down that hollow and round the back of these trees
Ill stay here and try to brazen it out
Ill get strafed to blazes anyhow 
I hope youll get me out of the scrape sir
Dont you worry my lad I said
Ill make it all square when I get back to town
Ill make for Bradfield for this place is a bit conspicuous
Goodbye Archie
Youre a good chap and Ill see you dont suffer
I started off down the hollow of the moor trying to make speed atone for lack of strategy for it was hard to know how much my pursuers commanded from that higher ground
They must have seen me for I heard whistles blown and mens cries
I struck a road crossed it and passed a ridge from which I had a view of Bradfield six miles off
And as I ran I began to reflect that this kind of chase could not last long
They were bound to round me up in the next halfhour unless I could puzzle them
But in that bare green place there was no cover and it looked as if my chances were pretty much those of a hare coursed by a good greyhound on a naked moor
Suddenly from just in front of me came a familiar sound
It was the roar of guns  the slam of fieldbatteries and the boom of small howitzers
I wondered if I had gone off my head
As I plodded on the rattle of machineguns was added and over the ridge before me I saw the dust and fumes of bursting shells
I concluded that I was not mad and that therefore the Germans must have landed
I crawled up the last slope quite forgetting the pursuit behind me
And then Im blessed if I did not look down on a veritable battle
There were two sets of trenches with barbed wire and all the fixings one set filled with troops and the other empty
On these latter shells were bursting but there was no sign of life in them
In the other lines there seemed the better part of two brigades and the first trench was stiff with bayonets
My first thought was that Home Forces had gone dotty for this kind of show could have no sort of training value
And then I saw other things  cameras and cameramen on platforms on the flanks and men with megaphones behind them on wooden scaffoldings
One of the megaphones was going full blast all the time
I saw the meaning of the performance at last
Some movie merchant had got a graft with the Government and troops had been turned out to make a war film
It occurred to me that if I were mixed up in that push I might get the cover I was looking for
I scurried down the hill to the nearest cameraman
As I ran the first wave of troops went over the top
They did it uncommon well for they entered into the spirit of the thing and went over with grim faces and that slow purposeful lope that I had seen in my own fellows at Arras
Smoke grenades burst among them and now and then some resourceful mountebank would roll over
Altogether it was about the best show I have ever seen
The cameras clicked the guns banged a background of boy scouts applauded and the dust rose in billows to the sky
But all the same something was wrong
I could imagine that this kind of business took a good deal of planning from the point of view of the moviemerchant for his purpose was not the same as that of the officer in command
You know how a photographer finicks about and is dissatisfied with a pose that seems all right to his sitter
I should have thought the spectacle enough to get any cinema audience off their feet but the man on the scaffolding near me judged differently
He made his megaphone boom like the swansong of a dying buffalo
He wanted to change something and didnt know how to do it
He hopped on one leg he took the megaphone from his mouth to curse he waved it like a banner and yelled at some opposite number on the other flank
And then his patience forsook him and he skipped down the ladder dropping his megaphone past the cameramen on to the battlefield
That was his undoing
He got in the way of the second wave and was swallowed up like a leaf in a torrent
For a moment I saw a red face and a loudchecked suit and the rest was silence
He was carried on over the hill or rolled into an enemy trench but anyhow he was lost to my ken
I bagged his megaphone and hopped up the steps to the platform
At last I saw a chance of firstclass cover for with Archies coat and cap I made a very good appearance as a moviemerchant
Two waves had gone over the top and the cinemamen working like beavers had filmed the lot
But there was still a fair amount of troops to play with and I determined to tangle up that outfit so that the fellows who were after me would have better things to think about
My advantage was that I knew how to command men
I could see that my opposite number with the megaphone was helpless for the mistake which had swept my man into a shellhole had reduced him to impotence
The troops seemed to be mainly in charge of NCOs I could imagine that the officers would try to shirk this business and an NCO
is the most literal creature on earth
So with my megaphone I proceeded to change the battle order
I brought up the third wave to the front trenches
In about three minutes the men had recognized the professional touch and were moving smartly to my orders
They thought it was part of the show and the obedient cameras clicked at everything that came into their orbit
My aim was to deploy the troops on too narrow a front so that they were bound to fan outward and I had to be quick about it for I didnt know when the hapless moviemerchant might be retrieved from the battlefield and dispute my authority
It takes a long time to straighten a thing out but it does not take long to tangle it especially when the thing is so delicate a machine as disciplined troops
In about eight minutes I had produced chaos
The flanks spread out in spite of all the shepherding of the NCOs and the fringe engulfed the photographers
The cameras on their little platforms went down like ninepins
It was solemn to see the startled face of a photographer taken unawares supplicating the purposeful infantry before he was swept off his feet into speechlessness
It was no place for me to linger in so I chucked away the megaphone and got mixed up with the tail of the third wave
I was swept on and came to anchor in the enemy trenches where I found as I expected my profane and breathless predecessor the movie merchant
I had nothing to say to him so I stuck to the trench till it ended against the slope of the hill
On that flank delirious with excitement stood a knot of boy scouts
My business was to get to Bradfield as quick as my legs would take me and as inconspicuously as the gods would permit
Unhappily I was far too great an object of interest to that nursery of heroes
Every boy scout is an amateur detective and hungry for knowledge
I was followed by several who plied me with questions and were told that I was off to Bradfield to hurry up part of the cinema outfit
It sounded lame enough for that cinema outfit was already past praying for
We reached the road and against a stone wall stood several bicycles
I selected one and prepared to mount
Thats Mr Emmotts machine said one boy sharply
He told me to keep an eye on it
I must borrow it sonny I said
Mr Emmotts my very good friend and wont object
From the place where we stood I overlooked the back of the battlefield and could see an anxious congress of officers
I could see others too whose appearance I did not like
They had not been there when I operated on the megaphone
They must have come downhill from the aerodrome and in all likelihood were the pursuers I had avoided
The exhilaration which I had won in the air and which had carried me into the tomfoolery of the past halfhour was ebbing
I had the hunted feeling once more and grew middleaged and cautious
I had a baddish record for the day what with getting Archie into a scrape and busting up an official cinema show  neither consistent with the duties of a brigadiergeneral
Besides I had still to get to London
I had not gone two hundred yards down the road when a boy scout pedalling furiously came up abreast me
Colonel Edgeworth wants to see you he panted
Youre to come back at once
Tell him I cant wait now I said
Ill pay my respects to him in an hour
He said you were to come at once said the faithful messenger
Hes in an awful temper with you and hes got bobbies with him
I put on pace and left the boy behind
I reckoned I had the better part of two miles start and could beat anything except petrol
But my enemies were bound to have cars so I had better get off the road as soon as possible
I coasted down a long hill to a bridge which spanned a small discoloured stream that flowed in a wooded glen
There was nobody for the moment on the hill behind me so I slipped into the covert shoved the bicycle under the bridge and hid Archies aquascutum in a bramble thicket
I was now in my own disreputable tweeds and I hoped that the shedding of my most conspicuous garment would puzzle my pursuers if they should catch up with me
But this I was determined they should not do
I made good going down that stream and out into a lane which led from the downs to the marketgardens round the city
I thanked Heaven I had got rid of the aquascutum for the August afternoon was warm and my pace was not leisurely
When I was in secluded ground I ran and when anyone was in sight I walked smartly
As I went I reflected that Bradfield would see the end of my adventures
The police knew that I was there and would watch the stations and hunt me down if I lingered in the place
I knew no one there and had no chance of getting an effective disguise
Indeed I very soon began to wonder if I should get even as far as the streets
For at the moment when I had got a lift on the back of a fishmongers cart and was screened by its flapping canvas two figures passed on motorbicycles and one of them was the inquisitive boy scout
The main road from the aerodrome was probably now being patrolled by motorcars
It looked as if there would be a degrading arrest in one of the suburbs
The fishcart helped by half a crown to the driver took me past the outlying smallvilladom between long lines of workmens houses to narrow cobbled lanes and the purlieus of great factories
As soon as I saw the streets well crowded I got out and walked
In my old clothes I must have appeared like some secondclass bookie or seedy horsecoper
The only respectable thing I had about me was my gold watch
I looked at the time and found it half past five
I wanted food and was casting about for an eatinghouse when I heard the purr of a motorcycle and across the road saw the intelligent boy scout
He saw me too and put on the brake with a sharpness which caused him to skid and all but come to grief under the wheels of a woolwagon
That gave me time to efface myself by darting up a side street
I had an unpleasant sense that I was about to be trapped for in a place I knew nothing of I had not a chance to use my wits
I remember trying feverishly to think and I suppose that my preoccupation made me careless
I was now in a veritable slum and when I put my hand to my vest pocket I found that my watch had gone
That put the top stone on my depression
The reaction from the wild burnout of the forenoon had left me very cold about the feet
I was getting into the underworld again and there was no chance of a second Archie Roylance turning up to rescue me
I remember yet the sour smell of the factories and the mist of smoke in the evening air
It is a smell I have never met since without a sort of dulling of spirit
Presently I came out into a marketplace
Whistles were blowing and there was a great hurrying of people back from the mills
The crowd gave me a momentary sense of security and I was just about to inquire my way to the railway station when someone jostled my arm
A roughlooking fellow in mechanics clothes was beside me
Mate he whispered
Ive got summat o yours here
And to my amazement he slipped my watch into my hand
It was took by mistake
Were friends o yours
Youre right enough if you do what I tell you
Theres a peeler over there got his eye on you
Follow me and Ill get you off
I didnt much like the mans looks but I had no choice and anyhow he had given me back my watch
He sidled into an alley between tall houses and I sidled after him
Then he took to his heels and led me a twisting course through smelly courts into a tanyard and then by a narrow lane to the backquarters of a factory
Twice we doubled back and once we climbed a wall and followed the bank of a blueblack stream with a filthy scum on it
Then we got into a very mean quarter of the town and emerged in a dingy garden strewn with tin cans and broken flowerpots
By a back door we entered one of the cottages and my guide very carefully locked it behind him
He lit the gas and drew the blinds in a small parlour and looked at me long and quizzically
He spoke now in an educated voice
I ask no questions he said but its my business to put my services at your disposal
You carry the passport
I stared at him and he pulled out his watch and showed a white andpurple cross inside the lid
I dont defend all the people we employ he said grinning
Mens morals are not always as good as their patriotism
One of them pinched your watch and when he saw what was inside it he reported to me
We soon picked up your trail and observed you were in a bit of trouble
As I say I ask no questions
What can we do for you
I want to get to London without any questions asked
Theyre looking for me in my present rig so Ive got to change it
Thats easy enough he said
Make yourself comfortable for a little and Ill fix you up
The night train goes at eleventhirty
 Youll find cigars in the cupboard and theres this weeks Critic on that table
Its got a good article on Conrad if you care for such things
I helped myself to a cigar and spent a profitable halfhour reading about the vices of the British Government
Then my host returned and bade me ascend to his bedroom
Youre Private Henry Tomkins of the 12th Gloucesters and youll find your clothes ready for you
Ill send on your present togs if you give me an address
I did as I was bid and presently emerged in the uniform of a British private complete down to the shapeless boots and the dropsical puttees
Then my friend took me in hand and finished the transformation
He started on my hair with scissors and arranged a lock which when well oiled curled over my forehead
My hands were hard and rough and only needed some grubbiness and hacking about the nails to pass muster
With my cap on the side of my head a pack on my back a service rifle in my hands and my pockets bursting with penny picture papers I was the very model of the British soldier returning from leave
I had also a packet of Woodbine cigarettes and a hunch of breadandcheese for the journey
And I had a railway warrant made out in my name for London
Then my friend gave me supper  bread and cold meat and a bottle of Bass which I wolfed savagely for I had had nothing since breakfast
He was a curious fellow as discreet as a tombstone very ready to speak about general subjects but never once coming near the intimate business which had linked him and me and Heaven knew how many others by means of a little purpleandwhite cross in a watchcase
I remember we talked about the topics that used to be popular at Biggleswick  the big political things that begin with capital letters
He took Amoss view of the soundness of the British workingman but he said something which made me think
He was convinced that there was a tremendous lot of German spy work about and that most of the practitioners were innocent
The ordinary Briton doesnt run to treason but hes not very bright
A clever man in that kind of game can make better use of a fool than a rogue
As he saw me off he gave me a piece of advice
Get out of these clothes as soon as you reach London
Private Tomkins will frank you out of Bradfield but it mightnt be a healthy alias in the metropolis
At eleventhirty I was safe in the train talking the jargon of the returning soldier with half a dozen of my own type in a smoky thirdclass carriage
I had been lucky in my escape for at the station entrance and on the platform I had noticed several men with the unmistakable look of plainclothes police
Also  though this may have been my fancy  I thought I caught in the crowd a glimpse of the bagman who had called himself Linklater
CHAPTER TEN The Advantages of an Air Raid The train was abominably late
It was due at eighttwentyseven but it was nearly ten when we reached St Pancras
I had resolved to go straight to my rooms in Westminster buying on the way a cap and waterproof to conceal my uniform should anyone be near my door on my arrival
Then I would ring up Blenkiron and tell him all my adventures
I breakfasted at a coffeestall left my pack and rifle in the cloakroom and walked out into the clear sunny morning
I was feeling very pleased with myself
Looking back on my madcap journey I seemed to have had an amazing run of luck and to be entitled to a little credit too
I told myself that persistence always pays and that nobody is beaten till he is dead
All Blenkirons instructions had been faithfully carried out
I had found Iverys post office
I had laid the lines of our own special communications with the enemy and so far as I could see I had left no clue behind me
Ivery and Gresson took me for a wellmeaning nincompoop
It was true that I had aroused profound suspicion in the breasts of the Scottish police
But that mattered nothing for Cornelius Brand the suspect would presently disappear and there was nothing against that rising soldier BrigadierGeneral Richard Hannay who would soon be on his way to France
After all this piece of service had not been so very unpleasant
I laughed when I remembered my grim forebodings in Gloucestershire
Bullivant had said it would be damnably risky in the long run but here was the end and I had never been in danger of anything worse than making a fool of myself
I remember that as I made my way through Bloomsbury I was not thinking so much of my triumphant report to Blenkiron as of my speedy return to the Front
Soon I would be with my beloved brigade again
I had missed Messines and the first part of Third Ypres but the battle was still going on and I had yet a chance
I might get a division for there had been talk of that before I left
I knew the Army Commander thought a lot of me
But on the whole I hoped I would be left with the brigade
After all I was an amateur soldier and I wasnt certain of my powers with a bigger command
In Charing Cross Road I thought of Mary and the brigade seemed suddenly less attractive
I hoped the war wouldnt last much longer though with Russia heading straight for the devil I didnt know how it was going to stop very soon
I was determined to see Mary before I left and I had a good excuse for I had taken my orders from her
The prospect entranced me and I was mooning along in a happy dream when I collided violently with in agitated citizen
Then I realized that something very odd was happening
There was a dull sound like the popping of the corks of flat sodawater bottles
There was a humming too from very far up in the skies
People in the street were either staring at the heavens or running wildly for shelter
A motorbus in front of me emptied its contents in a twinkling a taxi pulled up with a jar and the driver and fare dived into a secondhand bookshop
It took me a moment or two to realize the meaning of it all and I had scarcely done this when I got a very practical proof
A hundred yards away a bomb fell on a street island shivering every windowpane in a wide radius and sending splinters of stone flying about my head
I did what I had done a hundred times before at the Front and dropped flat on my face
The man who says he doesnt mind being bombed or shelled is either a liar or a maniac
This London air raid seemed to me a singularly unpleasant business
I think it was the sight of the decent civilized life around one and the orderly streets for what was perfectly natural in a rubbleheap like Ypres or Arras seemed an outrage here
I remember once being in billets in a Flanders village where I had the Maires house and sat in a room upholstered in cut velvet with wax flowers on the mantelpiece and oil paintings of three generations on the walls
The Boche took it into his head to shell the place with a longrange naval gun and I simply loathed it
It was horrible to have dust and splinters blown into that snug homely room whereas if I had been in a ruined barn I wouldnt have given the thing two thoughts
In the same way bombs dropping in central London seemed a grotesque indecency
I hated to see plump citizens with wild eyes and nursemaids with scared children and miserable women scuttling like rabbits in a warren
The drone grew louder and looking up I could see the enemy planes flying in a beautiful formation very leisurely as it seemed with all London at their mercy
Another bomb fell to the right and presently bits of our own shrapnel were clattering viciously around me
I thought it about time to take cover and ran shamelessly for the best place I could see which was a Tube station
Five minutes before the street had been crowded now I left behind me a desert dotted with one bus and three empty taxicabs
I found the Tube entrance filled with excited humanity
One stout lady had fainted and a nurse had become hysterical but on the whole people were behaving well
Oddly enough they did not seem inclined to go down the stairs to the complete security of underground but preferred rather to collect where they could still get a glimpse of the upper world as if they were torn between fear of their lives and interest in the spectacle
That crowd gave me a good deal of respect for my countrymen
But several were badly rattled and one man a little way off whose back was turned kept twitching his shoulders as if he had the colic
I watched him curiously and a movement of the crowd brought his face into profile
Then I gasped with amazement for I saw that it was Ivery
And yet it was not Ivery
There were the familiar nondescript features the blandness the plumpness but all so to speak in ruins
The man was in a blind funk
His features seemed to be dislimning before my eyes
He was growing sharper finer in a way younger a man without grip on himself a shapeless creature in process of transformation
He was being reduced to his rudiments
Under the spell of panic he was becoming a new man
And the crazy thing was that I knew the new man better than the old
My hands were jammed close to my sides by the crowd I could scarcely turn my head and it was not the occasion for ones neighbours to observe ones expression
If it had been mine must have been a study
My mind was far away from air raids back in the hot summer weather Of 1914
I saw a row of villas perched on a headland above the sea
In the garden of one of them two men were playing tennis while I was crouching behind an adjacent bush
One of these was a plump young man who wore a coloured scarf round his waist and babbled of golf handicaps 
I saw him again in the villa diningroom wearing a dinnerjacket and lisping a little

I sat opposite him at bridge I beheld him collared by two of Macgillivrays men when his comrade had rushed for the thirtynine steps that led to the sea 
I saw too the sittingroom of my old flat in Portland Place and heard little Scudders quick anxious voice talking about the three men he feared most on earth one of whom lisped in his speech
I had thought that all three had long ago been laid under the turf 
He was not looking my way and I could devour his face in safety
There was no shadow of doubt
I had always put him down as the most amazing actor on earth for had he not played the part of the First Sea Lord and deluded that officers daily colleagues
But he could do far more than any human actor for he could take on a new personality and with it a new appearance and live steadily in the character as if he had been born in it  My mind was a blank and I could only make blind gropings at conclusions  How had he escaped the death of a spy and a murderer for I had last seen him in the hands of justice
 Of course he had known me from the first day in Biggleswick 
I had thought to play with him and he had played most cunningly and damnably with me
In that sweating sardinetin of refugees I shivered in the bitterness of my chagrin
And then I found his face turned to mine and I knew that he recognized me
more I knew that he knew that I had recognized him  not as Ivery but as that other man
There came into his eyes a curious look of comprehension which for a moment overcame his funk
I had sense enough to see that that put the final lid on it
There was still something doing if he believed that I was blind but if he once thought that I knew the truth he would be through our meshes and disappear like a fog
My first thought was to get at him and collar him and summon everybody to help me by denouncing him for what he was
Then I saw that that was impossible
I was a private soldier in a borrowed uniform and he could easily turn the story against me
I must use surer weapons
I must get to Bullivant and Macgillivray and set their big machine to work
Above all I must get to Blenkiron
I started to squeeze out of that push for air raids now seemed far too trivial to give a thought to
Moreover the guns had stopped but so sheeplike is human nature that the crowd still hung together and it took me a good fifteen minutes to edge my way to the open air
I found that the trouble was over and the street had resumed its usual appearance
Buses and taxis were running and voluble knots of people were recounting their experiences
I started off for Blenkirons bookshop as the nearest harbour of refuge
But in Piccadilly Circus I was stopped by a military policeman
He asked my name and battalion and I gave him them while his suspicious eye ran over my figure
I had no pack or rifle and the crush in the Tube station had not improved my appearance
I explained that I was going back to France that evening and he asked for my warrant
I fancy my preoccupation made me nervous and I lied badly
I said I had left it with my kit in the house of my married sister but I fumbled in giving the address
I could see that the fellow did not believe a word of it
just then up came an APM
He was a pompous dugout very splendid in his red tabs and probably bucked up at having just been under fire
Anyhow he was out to walk in the strict path of duty
Tomkins
he said
Tomkins
Weve got some fellow of that name on our records
Bring him along Wilson
But sir I said I must  I simply must meet my friend
Its urgent business and I assure you Im all right
If you dont believe me Ill take a taxi and well go down to Scotland Yard and Ill stand by what they say
His brow grew dark with wrath
What infernal nonsense is this
Scotland Yard
What the devil has Scotland Yard to do with it
Youre an imposter
I can see it in your face
Ill have your depot rung up and youll be in jail in a couple of hours
I know a deserter when I see him
Bring him along Wilson
You know what to do if he tries to bolt
I had a momentary thought of breaking away but decided that the odds were too much against me
Fuming with impatience I followed the APM
to his office on the first floor in a side street
The precious minutes were slipping past Ivery now thoroughly warned was making good his escape and I the sole repository of a deadly secret was tramping in this absurd procession
The APM
issued his orders
He gave instructions that my depot should be rung up and he bade Wilson remove me to what he called the guardroom
He sat down at his desk and busied himself with a mass of buff dockets
in desperation I renewed my appeal
I implore you to telephone to Mr Macgillivray at Scotland Yard
Its a matter of life and death Sir
Youre taking a very big responsibility if you dont
I had hopelessly offended his brittle dignity
Any more of your insolence and Ill have you put in irons
Ill attend to you soon enough for your comfort
Get out of this till I send for you
As I looked at his foolish irritable face I realized that I was fairly UP against it
Short of assault and battery on everybody I was bound to submit
I saluted respectfully and was marched away
The hours I spent in that bare anteroom are like a nightmare in my recollection
A sergeant was busy at a desk with more buff dockets and an orderly waited on a stool by a telephone
I looked at my watch and observed that it was one oclock
Soon the slamming of a door announced that the APM
had gone to lunch
I tried conversation with the fat sergeant but he very soon shut me up
So I sat hunched up on the wooden form and chewed the cud of my vexation
I thought with bitterness of the satisfaction which had filled me in the morning
I had fancied myself the devil of a fine fellow and I had been no more than a mountebank
The adventures of the past days seemed merely childish
I had been telling lies and cutting capers over half Britain thinking I was playing a deep game and I had only been behaving like a schoolboy
On such occasions a man is rarely just to himself and the intensity of my selfabasement would have satisfied my worst enemy
It didnt console me that the futility of it all was not my blame
I was looking for excuses
It was the facts that cried out against me and on the facts I had been an idiotic failure
For of course Ivery had played with me played with me since the first day at Biggleswick
He had applauded my speeches and flattered me and advised me to go to the Clyde laughing at me all the time
Gresson too had known
Now I saw it all
He had tried to drown me between Colonsay and Mull
It was Gresson who had set the police on me in Morvern
The bagman Linklater had been one of Gressons creatures
The only meagre consolation was that the gang had thought me dangerous enough to attempt to murder me and that they knew nothing about my doings in Skye
Of that I was positive
They had marked me down but for several days I had slipped clean out of their ken
As I went over all the incidents I asked if everything was yet lost
I had failed to hoodwink Ivery but I had found out his post office and if he only believed I hadnt recognized him for the miscreant of the Black Stone he would go on in his old ways and play into Blenkirons hands
Yes but I had seen him in undress so to speak and he knew that I had so seen him
The only thing now was to collar him before he left the country for there was ample evidence to hang him on
The law must stretch out its long arm and collect him and Gresson and the Portuguese Jew try them by court martial and put them decently underground
But he had now had more than an hours warning and I was entangled with redtape in this damned APM
s office
The thought drove me frantic and I got up and paced the floor
I saw the orderly with rather a scared face making ready to press the bell and I noticed that the fat sergeant had gone to lunch
Say mate I said dont you feel inclined to do a poor fellow a good turn
I know Im for it all right and Ill take my medicine like a lamb
But I want badly to put a telephone call through
It aint allowed was the answer
Id get ell from the old man
But hes gone out I urged
I dont want you to do anything wrong mate I leave you to do the talkin if youll only send my message
Im flush of money and I dont mind handin you a quid for the job
He was a pinched little man with a weak chin and he obviously wavered
Oo dye want to talk to
he asked
Scotland Yard I said the home of the police
Lord bless you there cant be no harm in that
Yeve only got to ring up Scotland Yard  Ill give you the number  and give the message to Mr Macgillivray
Hes the head bummer of all the bobbies
That sounds a bit of all right he said
The old man e wont be back for alf an hour nor the sergeant neither
Lets see your quid though
I laid a pound note on the form beside me
Its yours mate if you get through to Scotland Yard and speak the piece Im goin to give you
He went over to the instrument
What dyou want to say to the bloke with the long name
Say that Richard Hannay is detained at the APM
s office in Claxton Street
Say hes got important news  say urgent and secret news  and ask Mr Macgillivray to do something about it at once
But Annay aint the name you gave
Lord bless you no
Did you never hear of a man borrowin another name
Anyhow thats the one I want you to give
But if this Mac man comes round ere theyll know es bin rung up and Ill ave the old man down on me
It took ten minutes and a second pound note to get him past this hurdle
By and by he screwed up courage and rang up the number
I listened with some nervousness while he gave my message  he had to repeat it twice  and waited eagerly on the next words
No sir I heard him say e dont want you to come round ere
E thinks as ow  I mean to say e wants  I took a long stride and twitched the receiver from him
Macgillivray I said is that you
Richard Hannay
For the love of God come round here this instant and deliver me from the clutches of a tomfool APM
Ive got the most deadly news
Theres not a second to waste
For Gods sake come quick
Then I added Just tell your fellows to gather Ivery in at once
You know his lairs
I hung up the receiver and faced a pale and indignant orderly
Its all right I said
I promise you that you wont get into any trouble on my account
And theres your two quid
The door in the next room opened and shut
The APM
had returned from lunch 
Ten minutes later the door opened again
I heard Macgillivrays voice and it was not pitched in dulcet tones
He had run up against minor officialdom and was making hay with it
I was my own master once more so I forsook the company of the orderly
I found a most rattled officer trying to save a few rags of his dignity and the formidable figure of Macgillivray instructing him in manners
Glad to see you Dick he said
This is General Hannay sir
It may comfort you to know that your folly may have made just the difference between your countrys victory and defeat
I shall have a word to say to your superiors
It was hardly fair
I had to put in a word for the old fellow whose red tabs seemed suddenly to have grown dingy
It was my blame wearing this kit
Well call it a misunderstanding and forget it
But I would suggest that civility is not wasted even on a poor devil of a defaulting private soldier
Once in Macgillivrays car I poured out my tale
Tell me its a nightmare I cried
Tell me that the three men we collected on the Ruff were shot long ago
Two he replied but one escaped
Heaven knows how he managed it but he disappeared clean out of the world
The plump one who lisped in his speech
Macgillivray nodded
Well were in for it this time
Have you issued instructions
Yes
With luck we shall have our hands on him within an hour
Weve our net round all his haunts
But two hours start
Its a big handicap for youre dealing with a genius
Yet I think we can manage it
Where are you bound for
I told him my rooms in Westminster and then to my old flat in Park Lane
The day of disguises is past
In half an hour Ill be Richard Hannay
Itll be a comfort to get into uniform again
Then Ill look up Blenkiron
He grinned
I gather youve had a riotous time
Weve had a good many anxious messages from the north about a certain Mr Brand
I couldnt discourage our men for I fancied it might have spoiled your game
I heard that last night they had lost touch with you in Bradfield so I rather expected to see you here today
Efficient body of men the Scottish police
Especially when they have various enthusiastic amateur helpers
So
he said
Yes of course
They would have
But I hope presently to congratulate you on the success of your mission
Ill bet you a pony you dont I said
I never bet on a professional subject
Why this pessimism
Only that I know our gentleman better than you
Ive been twice up against him
Hes the kind of wicked that dont cease from troubling till theyre stonedead
And even then Id want to see the body cremated and take the ashes into midocean and scatter them
Ive got a feeling that hes the biggest thing you or I will ever tackle
CHAPTER ELEVEN The Valley of Humiliation I collected some baggage and a pile of newly arrived letters from my rooms in Westminster and took a taxi to my Park Lane flat
Usually I had gone back to that old place with a great feeling of comfort like a boy from school who ranges about his room at home and examines his treasures
I used to like to see my hunting trophies on the wall and to sink into my own armchairs But now I had no pleasure in the thing
I had a bath and changed into uniform and that made me feel in better fighting trim
But I suffered from a heavy conviction of abject failure and had no share in Macgillivrays optimism
The awe with which the Black Stone gang had filled me three years before had revived a thousandfold
Personal humiliation was the least part of my trouble
What worried me was the sense of being up against something inhumanly formidable and wise and strong
I believed I was willing to own defeat and chuck up the game
Among the unopened letters was one from Peter a very bulky one which I sat down to read at leisure
It was a curious epistle far the longest he had ever written me and its size made me understand his loneliness
He was still at his German prisoncamp but expecting every day to go to Switzerland
He said he could get back to England or South Africa if he wanted for they were clear that he could never be a combatant again but he thought he had better stay in Switzerland for he would be unhappy in England with all his friends fighting
As usual he made no complaints and seemed to be very grateful for his small mercies
There was a doctor who was kind to him and some good fellows among the prisoners
But Peters letter was made up chiefly of reflection
He had always been a bit of a philosopher and now in his isolation he had taken to thinkin hard and poured out the results to me on pages of thin paper in his clumsy handwriting
I could read between the lines that he was having a stiff fight with himself
He was trying to keep his courage going in face of the bitterest trial he could be called on to face  a crippled old age
He had always known a good deal about the Bible and that and thePilgrims Progress were his chief aids in reflection
Both he took quite literally as if they were newspaper reports of actual recent events
He mentioned that after much consideration he had reached the conclusion that the three greatest men he had ever heard of or met were Mr ValiantforTruth the Apostle Paul and a certain Billy Strang who had been with him in Mashonaland in 92
Billy I knew all about he had been Peters hero and leader till a lion got him in the Blaauwberg
Peter preferred ValiantforTruth to Mr Greatheart I think because of his superior truculence for being very gentle himself he loved a bold speaker
After that he dropped into a vein of selfexamination
He regretted that he fell far short of any of the three
He thought that he might with luck resemble Mr Standfast for like him he had not much trouble in keeping wakeful and was also as poor as a howler and didnt care for women
He only hoped that he could imitate him in making a good end
Then followed some remarks of Peters on courage which came to me in that London room as if spoken by his living voice
I have never known anyone so brave so brave by instinct or anyone who hated so much to be told so
It was almost the only thing that could make him angry
All his life he had been facing death and to take risks seemed to him as natural as to get up in the morning and eat his breakfast
But he had started out to consider the very thing which before he had taken for granted and here is an extract from his conclusions
I paraphrase him for he was not grammatical
Its easy enough to be brave if youre feeling well and have food inside you
And its not so difficult even if youre short of a meal and seedy for that makes you inclined to gamble
I mean by being brave playing the game by the right rules without letting it worry you that you may very likely get knocked on the head
Its the wisest way to save your skin
It doesnt do to think about death if youre facing a charging lion or trying to bluff a lot of savages
If you think about it youll get it if you dont the odds are you wont
That kind of courage is only good nerves and experience 
Most courage is experience
Most people are a little scared at new things  You want a bigger heart to face danger which you go out to look for and which doesnt come to you in the ordinary way of business
Still thats Pretty much the same thing  good nerves and good health and a natural liking for rows
You see Dick in all that game theres a lot Of fun
Theres excitement and the fun of using your wits and skill and you know that the bad bits cant last long
When Arcoll sent me to Makapans kraal I didnt altogether fancy the job but at the worst it was three parts sport and I got so excited that I never thought of the risk till it was over  But the big courage is the coldblooded kind the kind that never lets go even when youre feeling empty inside and your bloods thin and theres no kind of fun or profit to be had and the troubles not over in an hour or two but lasts for months and years
One of the men here was speaking about that kind and he called it Fortitude
I reckon fortitudes the biggest thing a man can have  just to go on enduring when theres no guts or heart left in you
Billy had it when he trekked solitary from Garungoze to the Limpopo with fever and a broken arm just to show the Portugooses that he wouldnt be downed by them
But the head man at the job was the Apostle Paul  Peter was writing for his own comfort for fortitude was all that was left to him now
But his words came pretty straight to me and I read them again and again for I needed the lesson
Here was I losing heart just because I had failed in the first round and my pride had taken a knock
I felt honestly ashamed of myself and that made me a far happier man
There could be no question of dropping the business whatever its difficulties
I had a queer religious feeling that Ivery and I had our fortunes intertwined and that no will of mine could keep us apart
I had faced him before the war and won I had faced him again and lost the third time or the twentieth time we would reach a final decision
The whole business had hitherto appeared to me a trifle unreal at any rate my own connection with it
I had been docilely obeying orders but my real self had been standing aside and watching my doings with a certain aloofness
But that hour in the Tube station had brought me into the serum and I saw the affair not as Bullivants or even Blenkirons but as my own
Before I had been itching to get back to the Front now I wanted to get on to Iverys trail though it should take me through the nether pit
Peter was right fortitude was the thing a man must possess if he would save his soul
The hours passed and as I expected there came no word from Macgillivray
I had some dinner sent up to me at seven oclock and about eight I was thinking of looking up Blenkiron
just then came a telephone call asking me to go round to Sir Walter Bullivants house in Queen Annes Gate
Ten minutes later I was ringing the bell and the door was opened to me by the same impassive butler who had admitted me on that famous night three years before
Nothing had changed in the pleasant greenpanelled hall the alcove was the same as when I had watched from it the departure of the man who now called himself Ivery the telephone book lay in the very place from which I had snatched it in order to ring up the First Sea Lord
And in the back room where that night five anxious officials had conferred I found Sir Walter and Blenkiron
Both looked worried the American feverishly so
He walked up and down the hearthrug sucking an unlit black cigar
Say Dick he said this is a bad business
It wasnt no fault of yours
You did fine
It was us  me and Sir Walter and Mr Macgillivray that were the quitters
Any news
I asked
So far the covers drawn blank Sir Walter replied
It was the devils own work that our friend looked your way today
Youre pretty certain he saw that you recognized him
Absolutely
As sure as that he knew I recognized him in your hall three years ago when he was swaggering as Lord Alloa
No said Blenkiron dolefully that little flicker of recognition is just the one thing you cant be wrong about
Land alive
I wish Mr Macgillivray would come
The bell rang and the door opened but it was not Macgillivray
It was a young girl in a white ballgown with a cluster of blue cornflowers at her breast
The sight of her fetched Sir Walter out of his chair so suddenly that he upset his coffee cup
Mary my dear how did you manage it
I didnt expect you till the late train
I was in London you see and they telephoned on your telegram
Im staying with Aunt Doria and I cut her theatre party
She thinks Im at the Shandwicks dance so I neednt go home till morning  Good evening General Hannay
You got over the Hill Difficulty
The next stage is the Valley of Humiliation I answered
So it would appear she said gravely and sat very quietly on the edge of Sir Walters chair with her small cool hand upon his
I had been picturing her in my recollection as very young and glimmering a dancing exquisite child
But now I revised that picture
The crystal freshness of morning was still there but I saw how deep the waters were
It was the clean fineness and strength of her that entranced me
I didnt even think of her as pretty any more than a man thinks of the good looks of the friend he worships
We waited hardly speaking a word till Macgillivray came
The first sight of his face told his story
Gone
asked Blenkiron sharply
The mans lethargic calm seemed to have wholly deserted him
Gone repeated the newcomer
We have just tracked him down
Oh he managed it cleverly
Never a sign of disturbance in any of his lairs
His dinner ordered at Biggleswick and several people invited to stay with him for the weekend  one a member of the Government
Two meetings at which he was to speak arranged for next week
Early this afternoon he flew over to France as a passenger in one of the new planes
He had been mixed up with the Air Board people for months  of course as another man with another face
Miss Lamington discovered that just too late
The bus went out of its course and came down in Normandy
By this time our mans in Paris or beyond it
Sir Walter took off his big tortoiseshell spectacles and laid them carefully on the table
Roll up the map of Europe he said
This is our Austerlitz
Mary my dear I am feeling very old
Macgillivray had the sharpened face of a bitterly disappointed man
Blenkiron had got very red and I could see that he was blaspheming violently under his breath
Marys eyes were quiet and solemn
She kept on patting Sir Walters hand
The sense of some great impending disaster hung heavily on me and to break the spell I asked for details
Tell me just the extent of the damage I asked
Our neat plan for deceiving the Boche has failed
That is bad
A dangerous spy has got beyond our power
Thats worse
Tell me is there still a worst
Whats the limit of mischief he can do
Sir Walter had risen and joined Blenkiron on the hearthrug
His brows were furrowed and his mouth hard as if he were suffering Pain
There is no limit he said
None that I can see except the long suffering of God
You know the man as Ivery and you knew him as that other whom you believed to have been shot one summer morning and decently buried
You feared the second  at least if you didnt I did  most mortally
You realized that we feared Ivery and you knew enough about him to see his fiendish cleverness
Well you have the two men combined in one man
Ivery was the best brain Macgillivray and I ever encountered the most cunning and patient and longsighted
Combine him with the other the chameleon who can blend himself with his environment and has as many personalities as there are types and traits on the earth
What kind of enemy is that to have to fight
I admit its a steep proposition
But after all how much ill can he do
There are pretty strict limits to the activity of even the cleverest spy
I agree
But this man is not a spy who buys a few wretched subordinates and steals a dozen private letters
Hes a genius who has been living as part of our English life
Theres nothing he hasnt seen
Hes been on terms of intimacy with all kinds of politicians
We know that
He did it as Ivery
They rather liked him for he was clever and flattered them and they told him things
But God knows what he saw and heard in his other personalities
For all I know he may have breakfasted at Downing Street with letters of introduction from President Wilson or visited the Grand Fleet as a distinguished neutral
Then think of the women how they talk
Were the leakiest society on earth and we safeguard ourselves by keeping dangerous people out of it
We trust to our outer barrage
But anyone who has really slipped inside has a million chances
And this remember is one man in ten millions a man whose brain never sleeps for a moment who is quick to seize the slightest hint who can piece a plan together out of a dozen bits of gossip
Its like  its as if the Chief of the Intelligence Department were suddenly to desert to the enemy 
The ordinary spy knows only bits of unconnected facts
This man knows our life and our way of thinking and everything about us
Well but a treatise on English life in time of war wont do much good to the Boche
Sir Walter shook his head
Dont you realize the explosive stuff that is lying about
Ivery knows enough to make the next German peace offensive really deadly  not the blundering thing which it has been up to now but something which gets our weak spots on the raw
He knows enough to wreck our campaign in the field
And the awful thing is that we dont know just what he knows or what he is aiming for
This wars a packet of surprises
Both sides are struggling for the margin the little fraction of advantage and between evenly matched enemies its just the extra atom of foreknowledge that tells
Then weve got to push off and get after him I said cheerfully
But what are you going to do
asked Macgillivray
If it were merely a question of destroying an organization it might be managed for an organization presents a big front
But its a question of destroying this one man and his front is a razor edge
How are you going to find him
Its like looking for a needle in a haystack and such a needle
A needle which can become a piece of straw or a tintack when it chooses
All the same weve got to do it I said remembering old Peters lesson on fortitude though I cant say I was feeling very stouthearted
Sir Walter flung himself wearily into an armchair
I wish I could be an optimist he said but it looks as if we must own defeat
Ive been at this work for twenty years and though Ive been often beaten Ive always held certain cards in the game
Now Im hanged if Ive any
It looks like a knockout Hannay
Its no good deluding ourselves
Were men enough to look facts in the face and tell ourselves the truth
I dont see any ray of light in the business
Weve missed our shot by a hairsbreadth and thats the same as missing by miles
I remember he looked at Mary as if for confirmation but she did not smile or nod
Her face was very grave and her eyes looked steadily at him
Then they moved and met mine and they seemed to give me my marching orders
Sir Walter I said three years ago you and I sat in this very room
We thought we were done to the world as we think now
We had just that one miserable little clue to hang on to  a dozen words scribbled in a notebook by a dead man
You thought I was mad when I asked for Scudders book but we put our backs into the job and in twentyfour hours we had won out
Remember that then we were fighting against time
Now we have a reasonable amount of leisure
Then we had nothing but a sentence of gibberish
Now we have a great body of knowledge for Blenkiron has been brooding over Ivery like an old hen and he knows his ways of working and his breed of confederate
Youve got something to work on now
Do you mean to tell me that when the stakes are so big youre going to chuck in your hand
Macgillivray raised his head
We know a good deal about Ivery but Iverys dead
We know nothing of the man who was gloriously resurrected this evening in Normandy
Oh yes we do
There are many faces to the man but only one mind and you know plenty about that mind
I wonder said Sir Walter
How can you know a mind which has no characteristics except that it is wholly and supremely competent
Mere mental powers wont give us a clue
We want to know the character which is behind all the personalities
Above all we want to know its foibles
If we had only a hint of some weakness we might make a plan
Well lets set down all we know I cried for the more I argued the keener I grew
I told them in some detail the story of the night in the Coolin and what I had heard there
Theres the two names Chelius and Bommaerts
The man spoke them in the same breath as Effenbein so they must be associated with Iverys gang
Youve got to get the whole Secret Service of the Allies busy to fit a meaning to these two words
Surely to goodness youll find something
Remember those names dont belong to the Ivery part but to the big game behind all the different disguises  Then theres the talk about the Wild Birds and the Cage Birds
I havent a guess at what it means
But it refers to some infernal gang and among your piles of records there must be some clue
You set the intelligence of two hemispheres busy on the job
Youve got all the machinery and its my experience that if even one solitary man keeps chewing on at a problem he discovers something
My enthusiasm was beginning to strike sparks from Macgillivray
He was looking thoughtful now instead of despondent
There might be something in that he said but its a farout chance
Of course its a farout chance and thats all were ever going to get from Ivery
But weve taken a bad chance before and won  Then youve all that you know about Ivery here
Go through his dossier with a smalltooth comb and Ill bet you find something to work on
Blenkiron youre a man with a cool head
You admit weve a sporting chance
Sure Dick
Hes fixed things so that the lines are across the track but well clear somehow
So far as John S Blenkiron is concerned hes got just one thing to do in this world and thats to follow the yellow dog and have him neatly and cleanly tidied up
Ive got a stack of personal affronts to settle
I was easy fruit and he hasnt been very respectful
You can count me in Dick
Then were agreed I cried
Well gentlemen its up to you to arrange the first stage
Youve some pretty solid staff work to put in before you get on the trail
And you
Sir Walter asked
Im going back to my brigade
I want a rest and a change
Besides the first stage is office work and Im no use for that
But Ill be waiting to be summoned and Ill come like a shot as soon as you hoick me out
Ive got a presentiment about this thing
I know therell be a finish and that Ill be in at it and I think it will be a desperate bloody business too
I found Marys eyes fixed upon me and in them I read the same thought
She had not spoken a word but had sat on the edge of a chair swinging a foot idly one hand playing with an ivory fan
She had given me my old orders and I looked to her for confirmation of the new
Miss Lamington you are the wisest of the lot of us
What do you say
She smiled  that shy companionable smile which I had been picturing to myself through all the wanderings of the past month
I think you are right
Weve a long way to go yet for the Valley of Humiliation comes only halfway in thePilgrims Progress
The next stage was Vanity Fair
I might be of some use there dont you think
I remember the way she laughed and flung back her head like a gallant boy
The mistake weve all been making she said is that our methods are too terreaterre
Weve a poet to deal with a great poet and we must fling our imaginations forward to catch up with him
His strength is his unexpectedness you know and we wont beat him by plodding only
I believe the wildest course is the wisest for its the most likely to intersect his  Whos the poet among us
Peter I said
But hes pinned down with a game leg in Germany
All the same we must rope him in
By this time we had all cheered up for it is wonderful what a tonic there is in a prospect of action
The butler brought in tea which it was Bullivants habit to drink after dinner
To me it seemed fantastic to watch a slip of a girl pouring it out for two grizzled and distinguished servants of the State and one battered soldier  as decorous a family party as you would ask to see  and to reflect that all four were engaged in an enterprise where mens lives must be reckoned at less than thistledown
After that we went upstairs to a noble Georgian drawingroom and Mary played to us
I dont care two straws for music from an instrument  unless it be the pipes or a regimental band  but I dearly love the human voice
But she would not sing for singing to her I fancy was something that did not come at will but flowed only like a birds note when the mood favoured
I did not want it either
I was content to let Cherry Ripe be the one song linked with her in my memory
It was Macgillivray who brought us back to business
I wish to Heaven there was one habit of mind we could definitely attach to him and to no one else
At this moment He had only one meaning for us
You cant do nothing with his mind Blenkiron drawled
You cant loose the bands of Orion as the Bible says or hold Leviathan with a hook
I reckoned I could and made a mighty close study of his devices
But the darned cuss wouldnt stay put
I thought I had tied him down to the double bluff and he went and played the triple bluff on me
Theres nothing doing that line
A memory of Peter recurred to me
What about the blind spot
I asked and I told them old Peters pet theory
Every man that God made has his weak spot somewhere some flaw in his character which leaves a dull patch in his brain
Weve got to find that out and I think Ive made a beginning
Macgillivray in a sharp voice asked my meaning
Hes in a funk  of something
Oh I dont mean hes a coward
A man in his trade wants the nerve of a buffalo
He could give us all points in courage
What I mean is that hes not clean white all through
There are yellow streaks somewhere in him 
Ive given a good deal of thought to this courage business for I havent got a great deal of it myself
Not like Peter I mean
Ive got heaps of soft places in me
Im afraid of being drowned for one thing or of getting my eyes shot out
Iverys afraid of bombs  at any rate hes afraid of bombs in a big city
I once read a book which talked about a thing called agoraphobia
Perhaps its that  Now if we know that weak spot it helps us in our work
There are some places he wont go to and there are some things he cant do  not well anyway
I reckon thats useful
Yees said Macgillivray
Perhaps its not what youd call a burning and a shining light
Theres another chink in his armour I went on
Theres one person in the world he can never practise his transformations on and thats me
I shall always know him again though he appeared as Sir Douglas Haig
I cant explain why but Ive got a feel in my bones about it
I didnt recognize him before for I thought he was dead and the nerve in my brain which should have been looking for him wasnt working
But Im on my guard now and that nerves functioning at full power
Whenever and wherever and howsoever we meet again on the face of the earth it will be Dr Livingstone I presume between him and me
That is better said Macgillivray
If we have any luck Hannay it wont be long till we pull you out of His Majestys Forces
Mary got up from the piano and resumed her old perch on the arm of Sir Walters chair
Theres another blind spot which you havent mentioned
It was a cool evening but I noticed that her cheeks had suddenly flushed
Last week Mr Ivery asked me to marry him she said
PART II CHAPTER TWELVE I Become a Combatant Once More I returned to France on 13 September and took over my old brigade on the 19th of the same month
We were shoved in at the Polygon Wood on the 26th and after four days got so badly mauled that we were brought out to refit
On 7 October very much to my surprise I was given command of a division and was on the fringes of the Ypres fighting during the first days of November
From that front we were hurried down to Cambrai in support but came in only for the last backwash of that singular battle
We held a bit of the St Quentin sector till just before Christmas when we had a spell of rest in billets which endured so far as I was concerned till the beginning of January when I was sent off on the errand which I shall presently relate
That is a brief summary of my military record in the latter part Of 1917
I am not going to enlarge on the fighting
Except for the days of the Polygon Wood it was neither very severe nor very distinguished and you will find it in the history books
What I have to tell of here is my own personal quest for all the time I was living with my mind turned two ways
In the morasses of the Haanebeek flats in the slimy support lines at Zonnebeke in the tortured uplands about Flesquieres and in many other odd places I kept worrying at my private conundrum
At night I would lie awake thinking of it and many a toss I took into shellholes and many a time I stepped off the duckboards because my eyes were on a different landscape
Nobody ever chewed a few wretched clues into such a pulp as I did during those bleak months in Flanders and Picardy
For I had an instinct that the thing was desperately grave graver even than the battle before me
Russia had gone headlong to the devil Italy had taken it between the eyes and was still dizzy and our own prospects were none too bright
The Boche was getting uppish and with some cause and I foresaw a rocky time ahead till America could line up with us in the field
It was the chance for the Wild Birds and I used to wake in a sweat to think what devilry Ivery might be engineering
I believe I did my proper job reasonably well but I put in my most savage thinking over the other
I remember how I used to go over every hour of every day from that June night in the Cotswolds till my last meeting with Bullivant in London trying to find a new bearing
I should probably have got brainfever if I hadnt had to spend most of my days and nights fighting a stiffish battle with a very watchful Hun
That kept my mind balanced and I dare say it gave an edge to it for during those months I was lucky enough to hit on a better scent than Bullivant and Macgillivray and Blenkiron pulling a thousand wires in their London offices
I will set down in order of time the various incidents in this private quest of mine
The first was my meeting with Geordie Hamilton
It happened just after I rejoined the brigade when I went down to have a look at our Scots Fusilier battalion
The old brigade had been roughly handled on 31st July and had had to get heavy drafts to come anywhere near strength
The Fusiliers especially were almost a new lot formed by joining our remnants to the remains of a battalion in another division and bringing about a dozen officers from the training unit at home
I inspected the men and my eyes caught sight of a familiar face
I asked his name and the colonel got it from the sergeantmajor
It was LanceCorporal George Hamilton
Now I wanted a new batman and I resolved then and there to have my old antagonist
That afternoon he reported to me at brigade headquarters
As I looked at that solid bandylegged figure standing as stiff to attention as a tobacconists sign his ugly face hewn out of brown oak his honest sullen mouth and his blue eyes staring into vacancy I knew I had got the man I wanted
Hamilton I said you and I have met before
Sirr
came the mystified answer
Look at me man and tell me if you dont recognize me
He moved his eyes a fraction in a respectful glance
Sirr I dont mind of you
Well Ill refresh your memory
Do you remember the hall in Newmilns Street and the meeting there
You had a fight with a man outside and got knocked down
He made no answer but his colour deepened
And a fortnight later in a publichouse in Muirtown you saw the same man and gave him the chase of his life
I could see his mouth set for visions of the penalties laid down by the Kings Regulations for striking an officer must have crossed his mind
But he never budged
Look me in the face man I said
Do you remember me now
He did as he was bid
Sirr I mind of you
Have you nothing more to say
He cleared his throat
Sirr I did not ken I was hittin an officer
Of course you didnt
You did perfectly right and if the war was over and we were both free men I would give you a chance of knocking me down here and now
Thats got to wait
When you saw me last I was serving my country though you didnt know it
Were serving together now and you must get your revenge out of the Boche
Im going to make you my servant for you and I have a pretty close bond between us
What do you say to that
This time he looked me full in the face
His troubled eye appraised me and was satisfied
Im proud to be servant to ye sirr he said
Then out of his chest came a strangled chuckle and he forgot his discipline
Losh but yere the great lad
He recovered himself promptly saluted and marched off
The second episode befell during our brief rest after the Polygon Wood when I had ridden down the line one afternoon to see a friend in the Heavy Artillery
I was returning in the drizzle of evening clanking along the greasy path between the sad poplars when I struck a Labour company repairing the ravages of a Boche strafe that morning
I wasnt very certain of my road and asked one of the workers
He straightened himself and saluted and I saw beneath a disreputable cap the features of the man who had been with me in the Coolin crevice
I spoke a word to his sergeant who fell him out and he walked a bit of the way with me
Great Scot Wake what brought you here
I asked
Same thing as brought you
This rotten war
I had dismounted and was walking beside him and I noticed that his lean face had lost its pallor and that his eyes were less hot than they used to be
You seem to thrive on it I said for I did not know what to say
A sudden shyness possessed me
Wake must have gone through some violent cyclones of feeling before it came to this
He saw what I was thinking and laughed in his sharp ironical way
Dont flatter yourself youve made a convert
I think as I always thought
But I came to the conclusion that since the fates had made me a Government servant I might as well do my work somewhere less cushioned than a chair in the Home Office  Oh no it wasnt a matter of principle
One kind of works as good as another and Im a better clerk than a navvy
With me it was selfindulgence I wanted fresh air and exercise
I looked at him  mud to the waist and his hands all blistered and cut with unaccustomed labour
I could realize what his associates must mean to him and how he would relish the rough tonguing of noncoms
Youre a confounded humbug I said
Why on earth didnt you go into an OTC
and come out with a commission
Theyre easy enough to get
You mistake my case he said bitterly
I experienced no sudden conviction about the justice of the war
I stand where I always stood
Im a noncombatant and I wanted a change of civilian work  No it wasnt any idiotic tribunal sent me here
I came of my own free will and Im really rather enjoying myself
Its a rough job for a man like you I said
Not so rough as the fellows get in the trenches
I watched a battalion marching back today and they looked like ghosts who had been years in muddy graves
White faces and dazed eyes and leaden feet
Mines a cushy job
I like it best when the weathers foul
It cheats me into thinking Im doing my duty
I nodded towards a recent shellhole
Much of that sort of thing
Now and then
We had a good dusting this morning
I cant say I liked it at the time but I like to look back on it
A sort of moral anodyne
I wonder what on earth the rest of your lot make of you
They dont make anything
Im not remarkable for my bonhomie
They think Im a prig  which I am
It doesnt amuse me to talk about beer and women or listen to a gramophone or grouse about my last meal
But Im quite content thank you
Sometimes I get a seat in a corner of a YMCA
hut and Ive a book or two
My chief affliction is the padre
He was up at Keble in my time and as one of my colleagues puts it wants to be too bloody helpful
 What are you doing Hannay
I see youre some kind of general
Theyre pretty thick on the ground here
Im a sort of general
Soldiering in the Salient isnt the softest of jobs but I dont believe its as tough as yours is for you
Dyou know Wake I wish I had you in my brigade
Trained or untrained youre a dashed stouthearted fellow
He laughed with a trifle less acidity than usual
Almost thou persuadest me to be combatant
No thank you
I havent the courage and besides theres my jolly old principles
All the same Id like to be near you
Youre a good chap and Ive had the honour to assist in your education 
I must be getting back or the sergeant will think Ive bolted
We shook hands and the last I saw of him was a figure saluting stiffly in the wet twilight
The third incident was trivial enough though momentous in its results
just before I got the division I had a bout of malaria
We were in support in the Salient in very uncomfortable trenches behind Wieltje and I spent three days on my back in a dugout
Outside was a blizzard of rain and the water now and then came down the stairs through the gas curtain and stood in pools at my bed foot
It wasnt the merriest place to convalesce in but I was as hard as nails at the time and by the third day I was beginning to sit up and be bored
I read all my English papers twice and a big stack of German ones which I used to have sent up by a friend in the GHQ
Intelligence who knew I liked to follow what the Boche was saying
As I dozed and ruminated in the way a man does after fever I was struck by the tremendous display of one advertisement in the English press
It was a thing called Gussiters Deepbreathing System which according to its promoter was a cure for every ill mental moral or physical that man can suffer
Politicians generals admirals and musichall artists all testified to the new life it had opened up for them
I remember wondering what these sportsmen got for their testimonies and thinking I would write a spoof letter myself to old Gussiter
Then I picked up the German papers and suddenly my eye caught an advertisement of the same kind in the Frankfurter Zeitung
It was not Gussiter this time but one Weissmann but his game was identical  deep breathing
The Hun style was different from the English  all about the Goddess of Health and the Nymphs of the Mountains and two quotations from Schiller
But the principle was the same
That made me ponder a little and I went carefully through the whole batch
I found the advertisement in the Frankfurter and in one or two rather obscure Volkstimmes and Volkszeitungs
I found it too in Der Grosse Krieg the official German propagandist picture paper
They were the same all but one and that one had a bold variation for it contained four of the sentences used in the ordinary English advertisement
This struck me as fishy and I started to write a letter to Macgillivray pointing out what seemed to be a case of trading with the enemy and advising him to get on to Mr Gussiters financial backing
I thought he might find a Hun syndicate behind him
And then I had another notion which made me rewrite my letter
I went through the papers again
The English ones which contained the advertisement were all good solid bellicose organs the kind of thing no censorship would object to leaving the country
I had before me a small sheaf of pacifist prints and they had not the advertisement
That might be for reasons of circulation or it might not
The German papers were either Radical or Socialist publications just the opposite of the English lot except the Grosse Krieg
Now we have a free press and Germany has strictly speaking none
All her journalistic indiscretions are calculated
Therefore the Boche has no objection to his rags getting to enemy countries
He wants it
He likes to see them quoted in columns headed Through German Glasses and made the text of articles showing what a good democrat he is becoming
As I puzzled over the subject certain conclusions began to form in my mind
The four identical sentences seemed to hint that Deep Breathing had Boche affiliations
Here was a chance of communicating with the enemy which would defy the arguseyed gentlemen who examine the mails
What was to hinder Mr A at one end writing an advertisement with a good cipher in it and the paper containing it getting into Germany by Holland in three days
Herr B at the other end replied in the Frankfurter and a few days later shrewd editors and acute Intelligence officers  and Mr A  were reading it in London though only Mr A knew what it really meant
It struck me as a bright idea the sort of simple thing that doesnt occur to clever people and very rarely to the Boche
I wished I was not in the middle of a battle for I would have had a try at investigating the cipher myself
I wrote a long letter to Macgillivray putting my case and then went to sleep
When I awoke I reflected that it was a pretty thin argument and would have stopped the letter if it hadnt gone off early by a ration party
After that things began very slowly to happen
The first was when Hamilton having gone to Boulogne to fetch some mess stores returned with the startling news that he had seen Gresson
He had not heard his name but described him dramatically to me as the wee redheaded devil that kicked Ecky Brockies knee yon time in Glesca sirr I recognized the description
Gresson it appeared was joyriding
He was with a party of Labour delegates who had been met by two officers and carried off in charsabancs
Hamilton reported from inquiries among his friends that this kind of visitor came weekly
I thought it a very sensible notion on the Governments part but I wondered how Gresson had been selected
I had hoped that Macgillivray had weeks ago made a long arm and quodded him
Perhaps they had too little evidence to hang him but he was the blackest sort of suspect and should have been interned
A week later I had occasion to be at GHQ
on business connected with my new division
My friends in the Intelligence allowed me to use the direct line to London and I called up Macgillivray
For ten minutes I had an exciting talk for I had had no news from that quarter since I left England
I heard that the Portuguese Jew had escaped  had vanished from his native heather when they went to get him
They had identified him as a German professor of Celtic languages who had held a chair in a Welsh college  a dangerous fellow for he was an upright highminded raging fanatic
Against Gresson they had no evidence at all but he was kept under strict observation
When I asked about his crossing to France Macgillivray replied that that was part of their scheme
I inquired if the visit had given them any clues but I never got an answer for the line had to be cleared at that moment for the War Office
I hunted up the man who had charge of these Labour visits and made friends with him
Gresson he said had been a quiet well mannered and most appreciative guest
He had wept tears on Vimy Ridge and  strictly against orders  had made a speech to some troops he met on the Arras road about how British Labour was remembering the Army in its prayers and sweating blood to make guns
On the last day he had had a misadventure for he got very sick on the road  some kidney trouble that couldnt stand the jolting of the car  and had to be left at a village and picked up by the party on its way back
They found him better but still shaky
I crossexamined the particular officer in charge about that halt and learned that Gresson had been left alone in a peasants cottage for he said he only needed to lie down
The place was the hamlet of Eaucourt SainteAnne
For several weeks that name stuck in my head
It had a pleasant quaint sound and I wondered how Gresson had spent his hours there
I hunted it up on the map and promised myself to have a look at it the next time we came out to rest
And then I forgot about it till I heard the name mentioned again
On 23rd October I had the bad luck during a tour of my first line trenches to stop a small shellfragment with my head
It was a close misty day and I had taken off my tin hat to wipe my brow when the thing happened
I got a long shallow scalp wound which meant nothing but bled a lot and as we were not in for any big move the MO
sent me back to a clearing station to have it seen to
I was three days in the place and being perfectly well had leisure to look about me and reflect so that I recall that time as a queer restful interlude in the infernal racket of war
I remember yet how on my last night there a gale made the lamps swing and flicker and turned the greygreen canvas walls into a mass of mottled shadows
The floor canvas was muddy from the tramping of many feet bringing in the constant dribble of casualties from the line
In my tent there was no one very bad at the time except a boy with his shoulder halfblown off by a whizzbang who lay in a drugged sleep at the far end
The majority were influenza bronchitis and trenchfever  waiting to be moved to the base or convalescent and about to return to their units
A small group of us dined off tinned chicken stewed fruit and radon cheese round the smoky stove where two screens manufactured from packing cases gave some protection against the draughts which swept like young tornadoes down the tent
One man had been reading a book called the Ghost Stories of an Antiquary and the talk turned on the unexplainable things that happen to everybody once or twice in a lifetime
I contributed a yarn about the men who went to look for Krugers treasure in the bushveld and got scared by a green wildebeeste
It is a good yarn and Ill write it down some day
A tall Highlander who kept his slippered feet on the top of the stove and whose costume consisted of a kilt a British warm a grey hospital dressinggown and four pairs of socks told the story of the Camerons at First Ypres and of the Lowland subaltern who knew no Gaelic and suddenly found himself encouraging his men with some ancient Highland rigmarole
The poor chap had a racking bronchial cough which suggested that his country might well use him on some warmer battleground than Flanders
He seemed a bit of a scholar and explained the Cameron business in a lot of long words
I remember how the talk meandered on as talk does when men are idle and thinking about the next day
I didnt pay much attention for I was reflecting on a change I meant to make in one of my battalion commands when a fresh voice broke in
It belonged to a Canadian captain from Winnipeg a very silent fellow who smoked shag tobacco
Theres a lot of ghosts in this darned country he said
Then he started to tell about what happened to him when his division was last back in rest billets
He had a staff job and put up with the divisional command at an old French chateau
They had only a little bit of the house the rest was shut up but the passages were so tortuous that it was difficult to keep from wandering into the unoccupied part
One night he said he woke with a mighty thirst and since he wasnt going to get cholera by drinking the local water in his bedroom he started out for the room they messed in to try to pick up a whiskyandsoda
He couldnt find it though he knew the road like his own name
He admitted he might have taken a wrong turning but he didnt think so
Anyway he landed in a passage which he had never seen before and since he had no candle he tried to retrace his steps
Again he went wrong and groped on till he saw a faint light which he thought must be the room of the GSO a good fellow and a friend of his
So he barged in and found a big dim salon with two figures in it and a lamp burning between them and a queer unpleasant smell about
He took a step forward and then he saw that the figures had no faces
That fairly loosened his joints with fear and he gave a cry
One of the two ran towards him the lamp went out and the sickly scent caught suddenly at his throat
After that he knew nothing till he awoke in his own bed next morning with a splitting headache
He said he got the Generals permission and went over all the unoccupied part of the house but he couldnt find the room
Dust lay thick on everything and there was no sign of recent human presence
I give the story as he told it in his drawling voice
I reckon that was the genuine article in ghosts
You dont believe me and conclude I was drunk
I wasnt
There isnt any drink concocted yet that could lay me out like that
I just struck a crack in the old universe and pushed my head outside
It may happen to you boys any day
The Highlander began to argue with him and I lost interest in the talk
But one phrase brought me to attention
Ill give you the name of the darned place and next time youre around you can do a bit of prospecting for yourself
Its called the Chateau of Eaucourt SainteAnne about seven kilometres from Douvecourt
If I was purchasing real estate in this country I guess Id give that location a miss
After that I had a grim month what with the finish of Third Ypres and the hustles to Cambrai
By the middle of December we had shaken down a bit but the line my division held was not of our choosing and we had to keep a wary eye on the Boche doings
It was a weary job and I had no time to think of anything but the military kind of intelligence  fixing the units against us from prisoners stories organizing small raids and keeping the Royal Flying Corps busy
I was keen about the last and I made several trips myself over the lines with Archie Roylance who had got his hearts desire and by good luck belonged to the squadron just behind me
I said as little as possible about this for GHQ
did not encourage divisional generals to practise such methods though there was one famous army commander who made a hobby of them
It was on one of these trips that an incident occurred which brought my spell of waiting on the bigger game to an end
One dull December day just after luncheon Archie and I set out to reconnoitre
You know the way that fogs in Picardy seem suddenly to reek out of the ground and envelop the slopes like a shawl
That was our luck this time
We had crossed the lines flying very high and received the usual salute of Hun Archies
After a mile or two the ground seemed to climb up to us though we hadnt descended and presently we were in the heart of a cold clinging mist
We dived for several thousand feet but the confounded thing grew thicker and no sort of landmark could be found anywhere
I thought if we went on at this rate we should hit a tree or a church steeple and be easy fruit for the enemy
The same thought must have been in Archies mind for he climbed again
We got into a mortally cold zone but the air was no clearer
Thereupon he decided to head for home and passed me word to work out a compass course on the map
That was easier said than done but I had a rough notion of the rate we had travelled since we had crossed the lines and I knew our original direction so I did the best I could
On we went for a bit and then I began to get doubtful
So did Archie
We dropped low down but we could hear none of the row thats always going on for a mile on each side of the lines
The world was very eerie and deadly still so still that Archie and I could talk through the speakingtube
Weve mislaid this blamed battlehe shouted
I think your rotten old compass has soured on us I replied
We decided that it wouldnt do to change direction so we held on the same course
I was getting as nervous as a kitten chiefly owing to the silence
Its not what you expect in the middle of a battlefield 
I looked at the compass carefully and saw that it was really crocked
Archie must have damaged it on a former flight and forgotten to have it changed
He had a very scared face when I pointed this out
Great God
he croaked  for he had a fearsome cold  were either about Calais or near Paris or miles the wrong side of the Boche line
What the devil are we to do
And then to put the lid on it his engine went wrong
It was the same performance as on the Yorkshire moors and seemed to be a speciality of the SharkGladas type
But this time the end came quick
We dived steeply and I could see by Archies grip on the stick that he was going to have his work cut out to save our necks
Save them he did but not by much for we jolted down on the edge of a ploughed field with a series of bumps that shook the teeth in my head
It was the same dense dripping fog and we crawled out of the old bus and bolted for cover like two ferreted rabbits
Our refuge was the lee of a small copse
Its my opinion said Archie solemnly that were somewhere about La Cateau
Tim Wilbraham got left there in the Retreat and it took him nine months to make the Dutch frontier
Its a giddy prospect sir
I sallied out to reconnoitre
At the other side of the wood was a highway and the fog so blanketed sound that I could not hear a man on it till I saw his face
The first one I saw made me lie flat in the covert  For he was a German soldier fieldgrey forage cap red band and all and he had a pick on his shoulder
A seconds reflection showed me that this was not final proof
He might be one of our prisoners
But it was no place to take chances
I went back to Archie and the pair of us crossed the ploughed field and struck the road farther on
There we saw a farmers cart with a woman and child in it
They looked French but melancholy just what you would expect from the inhabitants of a countryside in enemy occupation
Then we came to the park wall of a great house and saw dimly the outlines of a cottage
Here sooner or later we would get proof of our whereabouts so we lay and shivered among the poplars of the roadside
No one seemed abroad that afternoon
For a quarter of an hour it was as quiet as the grave
Then came a sound of whistling and muffled steps
Thats an Englishman said Archie joyfully
No Boche could make such a beastly noise
He was right
The form of an Army Service Corps private emerged from the mist his cap on the back of his head his hands in his pockets and his walk the walk of a free man
I never saw a welcomer sight than that jammerchant
We stood up and greeted him
Whats this place
I shouted
He raised a grubby hand to his forelock
Ockott Saint Anny sir he said
Beg pardon sir but you aint hurt sir
Ten minutes later I was having tea in the mess of an MT
workshop while Archie had gone to the nearest Signals to telephone for a car and give instructions about his precious bus
It was almost dark but I gulped my tea and hastened out into the thick dusk
For I wanted to have a look at the Chateau
I found a big entrance with high stone pillars but the iron gates were locked and looked as if they had not been opened in the memory of man
Knowing the way of such places I hunted for the side entrance and found a muddy road which led to the back of the house
The front was evidently towards a kind of park at the back was a nest of outbuildings and a section of moat which looked very deep and black in the winter twilight
This was crossed by a stone bridge with a door at the end of it
Clearly the Chateau was not being used for billets
There was no sign of the British soldier there was no sign of anything human
I crept through the fog as noiselessly as if I trod on velvet and I hadnt even the company of my own footsteps
I remembered the Canadians ghost story and concluded I would be imagining the same sort of thing if I lived in such a place
The door was bolted and padlocked
I turned along the side of the moat hoping to reach the house front which was probably modern and boasted a civilized entrance
There must be somebody in the place for one chimney was smoking
Presently the moat petered out and gave place to a cobbled causeway but a wall running at right angles with the house blocked my way
I had half a mind to go back and hammer at the door but I reflected that majorgenerals dont pay visits to deserted chateaux at night without a reasonable errand
I should look a fool in the eyes of some old concierge
The daylight was almost gone and I didnt wish to go groping about the house with a candle
But I wanted to see what was beyond the wall  one of those whims that beset the soberest men
I rolled a dissolute waterbutt to the foot of it and gingerly balanced myself on its rotten staves
This gave me a grip on the flat brick top and I pulled myself up
I looked down on a little courtyard with another wall beyond it which shut off any view of the park
On the right was the Chateau on the left more outbuildings the whole place was not more than twenty yards each way
I was just about to retire by the road I had come for in spite of my fur coat it was uncommon chilly on that perch when I heard a key turn in the door in the Chateau wall beneath me
A lantern made a blur of light in the misty darkness
I saw that the bearer was a woman an oldish woman roundshouldered like most French peasants
In one hand she carried a leather bag and she moved so silently that she must have worn rubber boots
The light was held level with her head and illumined her face
It was the evillest thing I have ever beheld for a horrible scar had puckered the skin of the forehead and drawn up the eyebrows so that it looked like some diabolical Chinese mask
Slowly she padded across the yard carrying the bag as gingerly as if it had been an infant
She stopped at the door of one of the outhouses and set down the lantern and her burden on the ground
From her apron she drew something which looked like a gasmask and put it over her head
She also put on a pair of long gauntlets
Then she unlocked the door picked up the lantern and went in
I heard the key turn behind her
Crouching on that wall I felt a very ugly tremor run down my spine
I had a glimpse of what the Canadians ghost might have been
That hag hooded like some venomous snake was too much for my stomach
I dropped off the wall and ran  yes ran till I reached the highroad and saw the cheery headlights of a transport wagon and heard the honest speech of the British soldier
That restored me to my senses and made me feel every kind of a fool
As I drove back to the line with Archie I was black ashamed of my funk
I told myself that I had seen only an old countrywoman going to feed her hens
I convinced my reason but I did not convince the whole of me
An insensate dread of the place hung around me and I could only retrieve my selfrespect by resolving to return and explore every nook of it
CHAPTER THIRTEEN The Adventure of the Picardy Chateau I looked up Eaucourt SainteAnne on the map and the more I studied its position the less I liked it
It was the knot from which sprang all the main routes to our Picardy front
If the Boche ever broke us it was the place for which old Hindenburg would make
At all hours troops and transport trains were moving through that insignificant hamlet
Eminent generals and their staffs passed daily within sight of the Chateau
It was a convenient haltingplace for battalions coming back to rest
Supposing I argued our enemies wanted a keyspot for some assault upon the morale or the discipline or health of the British Army they couldnt find a better than Eaucourt SainteAnne
It was the ideal centre of espionage
But when I guardedly sounded my friends of the Intelligence they didnt seem to be worrying about it
From them I got a chit to the local French authorities and as soon as we came out of the line towards the end of December I made straight for the country town of Douvecourt
By a bit of luck our divisional quarters were almost next door
I interviewed a tremendous swell in a black uniform and black kid gloves who received me affably and put his archives and registers at my disposal
By this time I talked French fairly well having a natural turn for languages but half the rapid speech of the sousprifet was lost on me
By and by he left me with the papers and a clerk and I proceeded to grub up the history of the Chateau
It had belonged since long before Agincourt to the noble house of the DEaucourts now represented by an ancient Marquise who dwelt at Biarritz
She had never lived in the place which a dozen years before had been falling to ruins when a rich American leased it and partially restored it
He had soon got sick of it  his daughter had married a blackguard French cavalry officer with whom he quarrelled said the clerk  and since then there had been several tenants
I wondered why a house so unattractive should have let so readily but the clerk explained that the cause was the partridgeshooting
It was about the best in France and in 1912 had shown the record bag
The list of the tenants was before me
There was a second American an Englishman called Halford a Paris Jewbanker and an Egyptian prince
But the space for 1913 was blank and I asked the clerk about it
He told me that it had been taken by a woollen manufacturer from Lille but he had never shot the partridges though he had spent occasional nights in the house
He had a five years lease and was still paying rent to the Marquise
I asked the name but the clerk had forgotten
It will be written there he said
But no I said
Somebody must have been asleep over this register
Theres nothing after 1912
He examined the page and blinked his eyes
Someone indeed must have slept
No doubt it was young Louis who is now with the guns in Champagne
But the name will be on the Commissarys list
It is as I remember a sort of Flemish
He hobbled off and returned in five minutes
Bommaerts he said Jacques Bommaerts
A young man with no wife but with money  Dieu de Dieu what oceans of it
That clerk got twentyfive francs and he was cheap at the price
I went back to my division with a sense of awe on me
It was a marvellous fate that had brought me by odd routes to this outoftheway corner
First the accident of Hamiltons seeing Gresson then the night in the Clearing Station last the mishap of Archies plane getting lost in the fog
I had three grounds of suspicion  Gressons sudden illness the Canadians ghost and that horrid old woman in the dusk
And now I had one tremendous fact
The place was leased by a man called Bommaerts and that was one of the two names I had heard whispered in that faraway cleft in the Coolin by the stranger from the sea
A sensible man would have gone off to the contreespionage people and told them his story
I couldnt do this I felt that it was my own private find and I was going to do the prospecting myself
Every moment of leisure I had I was puzzling over the thing
I rode round by the Chateau one frosty morning and examined all the entrances
The main one was the grand avenue with the locked gates
That led straight to the front of the house where the terrace was  or you might call it the back for the main door was on the other side
Anyhow the drive came up to the edge of the terrace and then split into two one branch going to the stables by way of the outbuildings where I had seen the old woman the other circling round the house skirting the moat and joining the back road just before the bridge
If I had gone to the right instead of the left that first evening with Archie I should have circumnavigated the place without any trouble
Seen in the fresh morning light the house looked commonplace enough
Part of it was as old as Noah but most was newish and jerrybuilt the kind of flatchested thin French Chateau all front and no depth and full of draughts and smoky chimneys
I might have gone in and ransacked the place but I knew I should find nothing
It was borne in on me that it was only when evening fell that that house was interesting and that I must come like Nicodemus by night
Besides I had a private account to settle with my conscience
I had funked the place in the foggy twilight and it does not do to let a matter like that slide
A mans courage is like a horse that refuses a fence you have got to take him by the head and cram him at it again
If you dont he will funk worse next time
I hadnt enough courage to be able to take chances with it though I was afraid of many things the thing I feared most mortally was being afraid
I did not get a chance till Christmas Eve
The day before there had been a fall of snow but the frost set in and the afternoon ended in a green sunset with the earth crisp and crackling like a sharks skin
I dined early and took with me Geordie Hamilton who added to his many accomplishments that of driving a car
He was the only man in the BEF
who guessed anything of the game I was after and I knew that he was as discreet as a tombstone
I put on my oldest trench cap slacks and a pair of scaifesoled boots that I used to change into in the evening
I had a useful little electric torch which lived in my pocket and from which a cord led to a small bulb of light that worked with a switch and could be hung on my belt
That left my arms free in case of emergencies
Likewise I strapped on my pistol
There was little traffic in the hamlet of Eaucourt SainteAnne that night
Few cars were on the road and the MT
detachment judging from the din seemed to be busy on a private spree
It was about nine oclock when we turned into the side road and at the entrance to it I saw a solid figure in khaki mounting guard beside two bicycles
Something in the mans gesture as he saluted struck me as familiar but I had no time to hunt for casual memories
I left the car just short of the bridge and took the road which would bring me to the terraced front of the house
Once I turned the corner of the Chateau and saw the long ghostly facade white in the moonlight I felt less confident
The eeriness of the place smote me
In that still snowy world it loomed up immense and mysterious with its rows of shuttered windows each with that air which empty houses have of concealing some wild story
I longed to have old Peter with me for he was the man for this kind of escapade
I had heard that he had been removed to Switzerland and I pictured him now in some mountain village where the snow lay deep
I would have given anything to have had Peter with a whole leg by my side
I stepped on the terrace and listened
There was not a sound in the world not even the distant rumble of a cart
The pile towered above me like a mausoleum and I reflected that it must take some nerve to burgle an empty house
It would be good enough fun to break into a bustling dwelling and pinch the plate when the folk were at dinner but to burgle emptiness and silence meant a fight with the terrors in a mans soul
It was worse in my case for I wasnt cheered with prospects of loot
I wanted to get inside chiefly to soothe my conscience
I hadnt much doubt I would find a way for three years of war and the frequent presence of untidy headquarters staffs have loosened the joints of most Picardy houses
Theres generally a window that doesnt latch or a door that doesnt bar
But I tried window after window on the terrace without result
The heavy green sunshutters were down over each and when I broke the hinges of one there was a long bar within to hold it firm
I was beginning to think of shinning up a rainpipe and trying the second floor when a shutter I had laid hold on swung back in my hand
It had been left unfastened and kicking the snow from my boots I entered a room
A gleam of moonlight followed me and I saw I was in a big salon with a polished wood floor and dark lumps of furniture swathed in sheets
I clicked the bulb at my belt and the little circle of light showed a place which had not been dwelt in for years
At the far end was another door and as I tiptoed towards it something caught my eye on the parquet
It was a piece of fresh snow like that which clumps on the heel of a boot
I had not brought it there
Some other visitor had passed this way and not long before me
Very gently I opened the door and slipped in
In front of me was a pile of furniture which made a kind of screen and behind that I halted and listened
There was somebody in the room
I heard the sound of human breathing and soft movements the man whoever he was was at the far end from me and though there was a dim glow of Moon through a broken shutter I could see nothing of what he was after
I was beginning to enjoy myself now
I knew of his presence and he did not know of mine and that is the sport of stalking
An unwary movement of my hand caused the screen to creak
Instantly the movements ceased and there was utter silence
I held my breath and after a second or two the tiny sounds began again
I had a feeling though my eyes could not assure me that the man before me was at work and was using a very small shaded torch
There was just the faintest moving shimmer on the wall beyond though that might come from the crack of moonlight
Apparently he was reassured for his movements became more distinct
There was a jar as if a table had been pushed back
Once more there was silence and I heard only the intake of breath
I have very quick ears and to me it sounded as if the man was rattled
The breathing was quick and anxious
Suddenly it changed and became the ghost of a whistle  the kind of sound one makes with the lips and teeth without ever letting the tune break out clear
We all do it when we are preoccupied with something  shaving or writing letters or reading the newspaper
But I did not think my man was preoccupied
He was whistling to quiet fluttering nerves
Then I caught the air
It was Cherry Ripe
In a moment from being hugely at my ease I became the nervous one
I had been playing peepbo with the unseen and the tables were turned
My heart beat against my ribs like a hammer
I shuffled my feet and again there fell the tense silence
Mary I said  and the word seemed to explode like a bomb in the stillness Mary
Its me  Dick Hannay
There was no answer but a sob and the sound of a timid step
I took four paces into the darkness and caught in my arms a trembling girl  Often in the last months I had pictured the kind of scene which would be the culminating point of my life
When our work was over and war had been forgotten somewhere  perhaps in a green Cotswold meadow or in a room of an old manor  I would talk with Mary
By that time we should know each other well and I would have lost my shyness
I would try to tell her that I loved her but whenever I thought of what I should say my heart sank for I knew I would make a fool of myself
You cant live my kind of life for forty years wholly among men and be of any use at pretty speeches to women
I knew I should stutter and blunder and I used despairingly to invent impossible situations where I might make my love plain to her without words by some piece of melodramatic sacrifice
But the kind Fates had saved me the trouble
Without a syllable save Christian names stammered in that eerie darkness we had come to complete understanding
The fairies had been at work unseen and the thoughts of each of us had been moving towards the other till love had germinated like a seed in the dark
As I held her in my arms I stroked her hair and murmured things which seemed to spring out of some ancestral memory
Certainly my tongue had never used them before nor my mind imagined them  By and by she slipped her arms round my neck and with a half sob strained towards me
She was still trembling
Dick she said and to hear that name on her lips was the sweetest thing I had ever known
Dick is it really you
Tell me Im not dreaming
Its me sure enough Mary dear
And now I have found you I will never let you go again
But my precious child how on earth did you get here
She disengaged herself and let her little electric torch wander over my rough habiliments
You look a tremendous warrior Dick
I have never seen you like this before
I was in Doubting Castle and very much afraid of Giant Despair till you came
I think I call it the Interpreters House I said
Its the house of somebody we both know she went on
He calls himself Bommaerts here
That was one of the two names you remember
I have seen him since in Paris
Oh it is a long story and you shall hear it all soon
I knew he came here sometimes so I came here too
I have been nursing for the last fortnight at the Douvecourt Hospital only four miles away
But what brought you alone at night
Madness I think
Vanity too
You see I had found out a good deal and I wanted to find out the one vital thing which had puzzled Mr Blenkiron
I told myself it was foolish but I couldnt keep away
And then my courage broke down and before you came I would have screamed at the sound of a mouse
If I hadnt whistled I would have cried
But why alone and at this hour
I couldnt get off in the day
And it was safest to come alone
You see he is in love with me and when he heard I was coming to Douvecourt forgot his caution and proposed to meet me here
He said he was going on a long journey and wanted to say goodbye
If he had found me alone  well he would have said goodbye
If there had been anyone with me he would have suspected and he mustnt suspect me
Mr Blenkiron says that would be fatal to his great plan
He believes I am like my aunts and that I think him an apostle of peace working by his own methods against the stupidity and wickedness of all the Governments
He talks more bitterly about Germany than about England
He had told me how he had to disguise himself and play many parts on his mission and of course I have applauded him
Oh I have had a difficult autumn
Mary I cried tell me you hate him
No she said quietly
I do not hate him
I am keeping that for later
I fear him desperately
Some day when we have broken him utterly I will hate him and drive all likeness of him out of my memory like an unclean thing
But till then I wont waste energy on hate
We want to hoard every atom of our strength for the work of beating him
She had won back her composure and I turned on my light to look at her
She was in nurses outdoor uniform and I thought her eyes seemed tired
The priceless gift that had suddenly come to me had driven out all recollection of my own errand
I thought of Ivery only as a wouldbe lover of Mary and forgot the manufacturer from Lille who had rented his house for the partridgeshooting
And you Dick she asked is it part of a generals duties to pay visits at night to empty houses
I came to look for traces of M Bommaerts
I too got on his track from another angle but that story must wait
You observe that he has been here today
She pointed to some cigarette ash spilled on the table edge and a space on its surface cleared from dust
In a place like this the dust would settle again in a few hours and that is quite clean
I should say he has been here just after luncheon
Great Scott
I cried what a close shave
Im in the mood at this moment to shoot him at sight
You say you saw him in Paris and knew his lair
Surely you had a good enough case to have him collared
She shook her head
Mr Blenkiron  hes in Paris too  wouldnt hear of it
He hasnt just figured the thing out yet he says
Weve identified one of your names but were still in doubt about Chelius
Ah Chelius
Yes I see
We must get the whole business complete before we strike
Has old Blenkiron had any luck
Your guess about the Deepbreathing advertisement was very clever Dick
It was true and it may give us Chelius
I must leave Mr Blenkiron to tell you how
But the trouble is this
We know something of the doings of someone who may be Chelius but we cant link them with Ivery
We know that Ivery is Bommaerts and our hope is to link Bommaerts with Chelius
Thats why I came here
I was trying to burgle this escritoire in an amateur way
Its a bad piece of fake Empire and deserves smashing
I could see that Mary was eager to get my mind back to business and with some difficulty I clambered down from the exultant heights
The intoxication of the thing was on me  the winter night the circle of light in that dreary room the sudden coming together of two souls from the ends of the earth the realization of my wildest hopes the gilding and glorifying of all the future
But she had always twice as much wisdom as me and we were in the midst of a campaign which had no use for daydreaming
I turned my attention to the desk
It was a flat table with drawers and at the back a halfcircle of more drawers with a central cupboard
I tilted it up and most of the drawers slid out empty of anything but dust
I forced two open with my knife and they held empty cigar boxes
Only the cupboard remained and that appeared to be locked
I wedged a key from my pocket into its keyhole but the thing would not budge
Its no good I said
He wouldnt leave anything he valued in a place like this
That sort of fellow doesnt take risks
If he wanted to hide something there are a hundred holes in this Chateau which would puzzle the best detective
Cant you open it
she asked
Ive a fancy about that table
He was sitting here this afternoon and he may be coming back
I solved the problem by turning up the escritoire and putting my knee through the cupboard door
Out of it tumbled a little dark green attache case
This is getting solemn said Mary
Is it locked
It was but I took my knife and cut the lock out and spilled the contents on the table
There were some papers a newspaper or two and a small bag tied with black cord
The last I opened while Mary looked over my shoulder
It contained a fine yellowish powder
Stand back I said harshly
For Gods sake stand back and dont breathe
With trembling hands I tied up the bag again rolled it in a newspaper and stuffed it into my pocket
For I remembered a day near Peronne when a Boche plane had come over in the night and had dropped little bags like this
Happily they were all collected and the men who found them were wise and took them off to the nearest laboratory
They proved to be full of anthrax germs 
I remembered how Eaucourt SainteAnne stood at the junction of a dozen roads where all day long troops passed to and from the lines
From such a vantage ground an enemy could wreck the health of an army 
I remembered the woman I had seen in the courtyard of this house in the foggy dusk and I knew now why she had worn a gasmask
This discovery gave me a horrid shock
I was brought down with a crash from my high sentiment to something earthly and devilish
I was fairly well used to Boche filthiness but this seemed too grim a piece of the utterly damnable
I wanted to have Ivery by the throat and force the stuff into his body and watch him decay slowly into the horror he had contrived for honest men
Lets get out of this infernal place I said
But Mary was not listening
She had picked up one of the newspapers and was gloating over it
I looked and saw that it was open at an advertisement of Weissmanns Deepbreathing system
Oh look Dick she cried breathlessly
The column of type had little dots made by a red pencil below certain words
Its it she whispered its the cipher  Im almost sure its the cipher
Well hed be likely to know it if anyone did
But dont you see its the cipher which Chelius uses  the man in Switzerland
Oh I cant explain now for its very long but I think  I think  I have found out what we have all been wanting
Chelius  Whisht
I said
Whats that
There was a queer sound from the outofdoors as if a sudden wind had risen in the still night
Its only a car on the main road said Mary
How did you get in
I asked
By the broken window in the next room
I cycled out here one morning and walked round the place and found the broken catch
Perhaps it is left open on purpose
That may be the way M Bommaerts visits his country home  Lets get off Mary for this place has a curse on it
It deserves fire from heaven
I slipped the contents of the attache case into my pockets
Im going to drive you back I said
Ive got a car out there
Then you must take my bicycle and my servant too
Hes an old friend of yours  one Andrew Amos
Now how on earth did Andrew get over here
Hes one of us said Mary laughing at my surprise
A most useful member of our party at present disguised as an infirmier in Lady Manorwaters Hospital at Douvecourt
He is learning French and  Hush
I whispered
Theres someone in the next room
I swept her behind a stack of furniture with my eyes glued on a crack of light below the door
The handle turned and the shadows raced before a big electric lamp of the kind they have in stables
I could not see the bearer but I guessed it was the old woman
There was a man behind her
A brisk step sounded on the parquet and a figure brushed past her
It wore the horizonblue of a French officer very smart with those French ridingboots that show the shape of the leg and a handsome furlined pelisse
I would have called him a young man not more than thirtyfive
The face was brown and cleanshaven the eyes bright and masterful 
Yet he did not deceive me
I had not boasted idly to Sir Walter when I said that there was one man alive who could never again be mistaken by me
I had my hand on my pistol as I motioned Mary farther back into the shadows
For a second I was about to shoot
I had a perfect mark and could have put a bullet through his brain with utter certitude
I think if I had been alone I might have fired
Perhaps not
Anyhow now I could not do it
It seemed like potting at a sitting rabbit
I was obliged though he was my worst enemy to give him a chance while all the while my sober senses kept calling me a fool
I stepped into the light
Hullo Mr Ivery I said
This is an odd place to meet again
In his amazement he fell back a step while his hungry eyes took in my face
There was no mistake about the recognition
I saw something I had seen once before in him and that was fear
Out went the light and he sprang for the door
I fired in the dark but the shot must have been too high
In the same instant I heard him slip on the smooth parquet and the tinkle of glass as the broken window swung open
Hastily I reflected that his car must be at the moat end of the terrace and that therefore to reach it he must pass outside this very room
Seizing the damaged escritoire I used it as a ram and charged the window nearest me
The panes and shutters went with a crash for I had driven the thing out of its rotten frame
The next second I was on the moonlit snow
I got a shot at him as he went over the terrace and again I went wide
I never was at my best with a pistol
Still I reckoned I had got him for the car which was waiting below must come back by the moat to reach the highroad
But I had forgotten the great closed park gates
Somehow or other they must have been opened for as soon as the car started it headed straight for the grand avenue
I tried a couple of longrange shots after it and one must have damaged either Ivery or his chauffeur for there came back a cry of pain
I turned in deep chagrin to find Mary beside me
She was bubbling with laughter
Were you ever a cinema actor Dick
The last two minutes have been a really highclass performance
Featuring Mary Lamington
How does the jargon go
I could have got him when he first entered I said ruefully
I know she said in a graver tone
Only of course you couldnt 
Besides Mr Blenkiron doesnt want it  yet
She put her hand on my arm
Dont worry about it
It wasnt written it should happen that way
It would have been too easy
We have a long road to travel yet before we clip the wings of the Wild Birds
Look I cried
The fire from heaven
Red tongues of flame were shooting up from the outbuildings at the farther end the place where I had first seen the woman
Some agreed plan must have been acted on and Ivery was destroying all traces of his infamous yellow powder
Even now the concierge with her odds and ends of belongings would be slipping out to some refuge in the village
In the still dry night the flames rose for the place must have been made ready for a rapid burning
As I hurried Mary round the moat I could see that part of the main building had caught fire
The hamlet was awakened and before we reached the corner of the highroad sleepy British soldiers were hurrying towards the scene and the Town Major was mustering the fire brigade
I knew that Ivery had laid his plans well and that they hadnt a chance  that long before dawn the Chateau of Eaucourt SainteAnne would be a heap of ashes and that in a day or two the lawyers of the aged Marquise at Biarritz would be wrangling with the insurance company
At the corner stood Amos beside two bicycles solid as a graven image
He recognized me with a gaptoothed grin
Its a cauld night General but the home fires keep burnin
I havena seen such a cheery lowe since Dicksons mill at Gawly
We packed bicycles and all into my car with Amos wedged in the narrow seat beside Hamilton
Recognizing a fellow countryman he gave thanks for the lift in the broadest Doric
For said he Im not what you would call a practised hand wi a velocipede and my feet are dinnled wi standin in the snaw
As for me the miles to Douvecourt passed as in a blissful moment of time
I wrapped Mary in a fur rug and after that we did not speak a word
I had come suddenly into a great possession and was dazed with the joy of it
CHAPTER FOURTEEN Mr Blenkiron Discourses on Love and War Three days later I got my orders to report at Paris for special service
They came none too soon for I chafed at each hours delay
Every thought in my head was directed to the game which we were playing against Ivery
He was the big enemy compared to whom the ordinary Boche in the trenches was innocent and friendly
I had almost lost interest in my division for I knew that for me the real battlefront was not in Picardy and that my job was not so easy as holding a length of line
Also I longed to be at the same work as Mary
I remember waking up in billets the morning after the night at the Chateau with the feeling that I had become extraordinarily rich
I felt very humble too and very kindly towards all the world  even to the Boche though I cant say I had ever hated him very wildly
You find hate more among journalists and politicians at home than among fighting men
I wanted to be quiet and alone to think and since that was impossible I went about my work in a happy abstraction
I tried not to look ahead but only to live in the present remembering that a war was on and that there was desperate and dangerous business before me and that my hopes hung on a slender thread
Yet for all that I had sometimes to let my fancies go free and revel in delicious dreams
But there was one thought that always brought me back to hard ground and that was Ivery
I do not think I hated anybody in the world but him
It was his relation to Mary that stung me
He had the insolence with all his toadlike past to make love to that clean and radiant girl
I felt that he and I stood as mortal antagonists and the thought pleased me for it helped me to put some honest detestation into my job
Also I was going to win
Twice I had failed but the third time I should succeed
It had been like ranging shots for a gun  first short second over and I vowed that the third should be dead on the mark
I was summoned to GHQ where I had half an hours talk with the greatest British commander
I can see yet his patient kindly face and that steady eye which no vicissitude of fortune could perturb
He took the biggest view for he was statesman as well as soldier and knew that the whole world was one battlefield and every man and woman among the combatant nations was in the battleline
So contradictory is human nature that talk made me wish for a moment to stay where I was
I wanted to go on serving under that man
I realized suddenly how much I loved my work and when I got back to my quarters that night and saw my men swinging in from a route march I could have howled like a dog at leaving them
Though I say it who shouldnt there wasnt a better division in the Army
One morning a few days later I picked up Mary in Amiens
I always liked the place for after the dirt of the Somme it was a comfort to go there for a bath and a square meal and it had the noblest church that the hand of man ever built for God
It was a clear morning when we started from the boulevard beside the railway station and the air smelt of washed streets and fresh coffee and women were going marketing and the little trams ran clanking by just as in any other city far from the sound of guns
There was very little khaki or horizonblue about and I remember thinking how completely Amiens had got out of the warzone
Two months later it was a different story
To the end I shall count that day as one of the happiest in my life
Spring was in the air though the trees and fields had still their winter colouring
A thousand good fresh scents came out of the earth and the larks were busy over the new furrows
I remember that we ran up a little glen where a stream spread into pools among sallows and the roadside trees were heavy with mistletoe
On the tableland beyond the Somme valley the sun shone like April
At Beauvais we lunched badly in an inn  badly as to food but there was an excellent Burgundy at two francs a bottle
Then we slipped down through little flatchested townships to the Seine and in the late afternoon passed through St Germains forest
The wide green spaces among the trees set my fancy dwelling on that divine English countryside where Mary and I would one day make our home
She had been in high spirits all the journey but when I spoke of the Cotswolds her face grew grave
Dont let us speak of it Dick she said
Its too happy a thing and I feel as if it would wither if we touched it
I dont let myself think of peace and home for it makes me too homesick 
I think we shall get there some day you and I  but its a long road to the Delectable Mountains and Faithful you know has to die first 
There is a price to be paid
The words sobered me
Who is our Faithful
I asked
I dont know
But he was the best of the Pilgrims
Then as if a veil had lifted her mood changed and when we came through the suburbs of Paris and swung down the Champs Elysees she was in a holiday humour
The lights were twinkling in the blue January dusk and the warm breath of the city came to greet us
I knew little of the place for I had visited it once only on a four days Paris leave but it had seemed to me then the most habitable of cities and now coming from the battlefield with Mary by my side it was like the happy ending of a dream
I left her at her cousins house near the Rue St Honore and deposited myself according to instructions at the Hotel Louis Quinze
There I wallowed in a hot bath and got into the civilian clothes which had been sent on from London
They made me feel that I had taken leave of my division for good and all this time
Blenkiron had a private room where we were to dine and a more wonderful litter of books and cigar boxes I have never seen for he hadnt a notion of tidiness
I could hear him grunting at his toilet in the adjacent bedroom and I noticed that the table was laid for three
I went downstairs to get a paper and on the way ran into Launcelot Wake
He was no longer a private in a Labour Battalion
Evening clothes showed beneath his overcoat
Hullo Wake are you in this push too
I suppose so he said and his manner was not cordial
Anyhow I was ordered down here
My business is to do as I am told
Coming to dine
I asked
No
Im dining with some friends at the Crillon
Then he looked me in the face and his eyes were hot as I first remembered them
I hear Ive to congratulate you Hannay and he held out a limp hand
I never felt more antagonism in a human being
You dont like it
I said for I guessed what he meant
How on earth can I like it
he cried angrily
Good Lord man youll murder her soul
You an ordinary stupid successful fellow and she  shes the most precious thing God ever made
You can never understand a fraction of her preciousness but youll clip her wings all right
She can never fly now  He poured out this hysterical stuff to me at the foot of the staircase within hearing of an elderly French widow with a poodle
I had no impulse to be angry for I was far too happy
Dont Wake I said
Were all too close together to quarrel
Im not fit to black Marys shoes
You cant put me too low or her too high
But Ive at least the sense to know it
You couldnt want me to be humbler than I felt
He shrugged his shoulders as he went out to the street
Your infernal magnanimity would break any mans temper
I went upstairs to find Blenkiron washed and shaven admiring a pair of bright patentleather shoes
Why Dick Ive been wearying bad to see you
I was nervous you would be blown to glory for Ive been reading awful things about your battles in the noospapers
The war correspondents worry me so I cant take breakfast
He mixed cocktails and clinked his glass on mine
Heres to the young lady
I was trying to write her a pretty little sonnet but the darned rhymes wouldnt fit
Ive gotten a heap of things to say to you when weve finished dinner
Mary came in her cheeks bright from the weather and Blenkiron promptly fell abashed
But she had a way to meet his shyness for when he began an embarrassed speech of good wishes she put her arms round his neck and kissed him
Oddly enough that set him completely at his ease
It was pleasant to eat off linen and china again pleasant to see old Blenkirons benignant face and the way he tucked into his food but it was delicious for me to sit at a meal with Mary across the table
It made me feel that she was really mine and not a pixie that would vanish at a word
To Blenkiron she bore herself like an affectionate but mischievous daughter while the desperately refined manners that afflicted him whenever women were concerned mellowed into something like his everyday self
They did most of the talking and I remember he fetched from some mysterious hidingplace a great box of chocolates which you could no longer buy in Paris and the two ate them like spoiled children
I didnt want to talk for it was pure happiness for me to look on
I loved to watch her when the servants had gone with her elbows on the table like a schoolboy her crisp gold hair a little rumpled cracking walnuts with gusto like some child who has been allowed down from the nursery for dessert and means to make the most of it
With his first cigar Blenkiron got to business
You want to know about the staffwork weve been busy on at home
Well its finished now thanks to you Dick
We werent getting on very fast till you took to peroosing the press on your sickbed and dropped us that hint about the Deepbreathing ads
Then there was something in it
I asked
There was black hell in it
There wasnt any Gussiter but there was a mighty fine little syndicate of crooks with old man Gresson at the back of them
First thing I started out to get the cipher
It took some looking for but theres no cipher on earth cant be got hold of somehow if you know its there and in this case we were helped a lot by the return messages in the German papers
It was bad stuff when we read it and explained the darned leakages in important noos weve been up against
At first I figured to keep the thing going and turn Gussiter into a corporation with John S Blenkiron as president
But it wouldnt do for at the first hint Of tampering with their communications the whole bunch got skeery and sent out SOS signals
So we tenderly plucked the flowers
Gresson too
I asked
He nodded
I guess your seafaring companions now under the sod
We had collected enough evidence to hang him ten times over 
But that was the least of it
For your little old cipher Dick gave us a line on Ivery
I asked how and Blenkiron told me the story
He had about a dozen crossbearings proving that the organization of the Deep breathing game had its headquarters in Switzerland
He suspected Ivery from the first but the man had vanished out of his ken so he started working from the other end and instead of trying to deduce the Swiss business from Ivery he tried to deduce Ivery from the Swiss business
He went to Berne and made a conspicuous public fool of himself for several weeks
He called himself an agent of the American propaganda there and took some advertising space in the press and put in spreadeagle announcements of his mission with the result that the Swiss Government threatened to turn him out of the country if he tampered that amount with their neutrality
He also wrote a lot of rot in the Geneva newspapers which he paid to have printed explaining how he was a pacifist and was going to convert Germany to peace by inspirational advertisement of pure minded war aims
All this was in keeping with his English reputation and he wanted to make himself a bait for Ivery
But Ivery did not rise to the fly and though he had a dozen agents working for him on the quiet he could never hear of the name Chelius
That was he reckoned a very private and particular name among the Wild Birds
However he got to know a good deal about the Swiss end of the Deepbreathing business
That took some doing and cost a lot of money
His best people were a girl who posed as a mannequin in a milliners shop in Lyons and a concierge in a big hotel at St Moritz
His most important discovery was that there was a second cipher in the return messages sent from Switzerland different from the one that the Gussiter lot used in England
He got this cipher but though he could read it he couldnt make anything out of it
He concluded that it was a very secret means of communication between the inner circle of the Wild Birds and that Ivery must be at the back of it 
But he was still a long way from finding out anything that mattered
Then the whole situation changed for Mary got in touch with Ivery
I must say she behaved like a shameless minx for she kept on writing to him to an address he had once given her in Paris and suddenly she got an answer
She was in Paris herself helping to run one of the railway canteens and staying with her French cousins the de Mezieres
One day he came to see her
That showed the boldness of the man and his cleverness for the whole secret police of France were after him and they never got within sight or sound
Yet here he was coming openly in the afternoon to have tea with an English girl
It showed another thing which made me blaspheme
A man so resolute and singlehearted in his job must have been pretty badly in love to take a risk like that
He came and he called himself the Capitaine Bommaerts with a transport job on the staff of the French GQG
He was on the staff right enough too
Mary said that when she heard that name she nearly fell down
He was quite frank with her and she with him
They are both peacemakers ready to break the laws of any land for the sake of a great ideal
Goodness knows what stuff they talked together
Mary said she would blush to think of it till her dying day and I gathered that on her side it was a mixture of Launcelot Wake at his most pedantic and schoolgirl silliness
He came again and they met often unbeknown to the decorous Madame de Mezieres
They walked together in the Bois de Boulogne and once with a beating heart she motored with him to Auteuil for luncheon
He spoke of his house in Picardy and there were moments I gathered when he became the declared lover to be rebuffed with a hoydenish shyness
Presently the pace became too hot and after some anguished arguments with Bullivant on the longdistance telephone she went off to Douvecourt to Lady Manorwaters hospital
She went there to escape from him but mainly I think to have a look  trembling in every limb mind you  at the Chateau of Eaucourt SainteAnne
I had only to think of Mary to know just what Joan of Arc was
No man ever born could have done that kind of thing
It wasnt recklessness
It was sheer calculating courage
Then Blenkiron took up the tale
The newspaper we found that Christmas Eve in the Chateau was of tremendous importance for Bommaerts had pricked out in the advertisement the very special second cipher of the Wild Birds
That proved that Ivery was at the back of the Swiss business
But Blenkiron made doubly sure
I considered the time had come he said to pay high for valuable noos so I sold the enemy a very pretty device
If you ever gave your mind to ciphers and illicit correspondence Dick you would know that the one kind of document you cant write on in invisible ink is a coated paper the kind they use in the weeklies to print photographs of leading actresses and the stately homes of England
Anything wet that touches it corrugates the surface a little and you can tell with a microscope if someones been playing at it
Well we had the good fortune to discover just how to get over that little difficulty  how to write on glazed paper with a quill so as the cutest analyst couldnt spot it and likewise how to detect the writing
I decided to sacrifice that invention casting my bread upon the waters and looking for a goodsized bakery in return 
I had it sold to the enemy
The job wanted delicate handling but the tenth man from me  he was an Austrian Jew  did the deal and scooped fifty thousand dollars out of it
Then I lay low to watch how my friend would use the device and I didnt wait long
He took from his pocket a folded sheet of LIllustration
Over a photogravure plate ran some words in a large sprawling hand as if written with a brush
That page when I got it yesterday he said was an unassuming picture of General Petain presenting military medals
There wasnt a scratch or a ripple on its surface
But I got busy with it and see there
He pointed out two names
The writing was a set of keywords we did not know but two names stood out which I knew too well
They were Bommaerts and Chelius
My God
I cried thats uncanny
It only shows that if you chew long enough   
Dick said Mary you mustnt say that again
At the best its an ugly metaphor and youre making it a platitude
Who is Ivery anyhow
I asked
Do you know more about him than we knew in the summer
Mary what did Bommaerts pretend to be
An Englishman
Mary spoke in the most matteroffact tone as if it were a perfectly usual thing to be made love to by a spy and that rather soothed my annoyance
When he asked me to marry him he proposed to take me to a countryhouse in Devonshire
I rather think too he had a place in Scotland
But of course hes a German
Yees said Blenkiron slowly Ive got on to his record and it isnt a pretty story
Its taken some working out but Ive got all the links tested now 
Hes a Boche and a largesized nobleman in his own state
Did you ever hear of the Graf von Schwabing
I shook my head
I think I have heard Uncle Charlie speak of him said Mary wrinkling her brows
He used to hunt with the Pytchley
Thats the man
But he hasnt troubled the Pytchley for the last eight years
There was a time when he was the last thing in smartness in the German court  officer in the Guards ancient family rich darned clever  all the fixings
Kaiser liked him and its easy to see why
I guess a man who had as many personalities as the Graf was amusing afterdinner company
Specially among the Germans who in my experience dont excel in the lighter vein
Anyway he was Williams whiteheaded boy and there wasnt a mother with a daughter who wasnt out gunning for Otto von Schwabing
He was about as popular in London and Noo York  and in Paris too
Ask Sir Walter about him Dick
He says he had twice the brains of Kuhlmann and better manners than the Austrian fellow he used to yarn about  Well one day there came an almighty court scandal and the bottom dropped out of the Grafs World
It was a pretty beastly story and I dont gather that SchwabIng was as deep in it as some others
But the trouble was that those others had to be shielded at all costs and Schwabing was made the scapegoat
His name came out in the papers and he had to go 
What was the case called
I asked
Blenkiron mentioned a name and I knew why the word SchwabIng was familiar
I had read the story long ago in Rhodesia
It was some smash Blenkiron went on
He was drummed out of the Guards out of the clubs out of the country  Now how would you have felt Dick if you had been the Graf
Your life and work and happiness crossed out and all to save a mangy princeling
Bitter as hell you say
Hungering for a chance to put it across the lot that had outed you
You wouldnt rest till you had William sobbing on his knees asking your pardon and you not thinking of granting it
Thats the way youd feel but that wasnt the Grafs way and whats more it isnt the German way
He went into exile hating humanity and with a heart all poison and snakes but itching to get back
And Ill tell you why
Its because his kind of German hasnt got any other home on this earth
Oh yes I know theres stacks of good old Teutons come and squat in our little country and turn into fine Americans
You can do a lot with them if you catch them young and teach them the Declaration of Independence and make them study our Sunday papers
But you cant deny theres something comic in the rough about all Germans before youve civilized them
Theyre a pecooliar people a darned pecooliar people else they wouldnt staff all the menial and indecent occupations on the globe
But that pecooliarity which is only skindeep in the working Boche is in the bone of the grandee
Your German aristocracy cant consort on terms of equality with any other Upper Ten Thousand
They swagger and bluff about the world but they know very well that the worlds sniggering at them
Theyre like a boss from Salt Creek Gully whos made his pile and bought a dress suit and dropped into a Newport evening party
They dont know where to put their hands or how to keep their feet still 
Your copperbottomed English nobleman has got to keep jogging himself to treat them as equals instead of sending them down to the servants hall
Their fine fixings are just the high light that reveals the everlasting jay
They cant be gentlemen because they arent sure of themselves
The world laughs at them and they know it and it riles them like hell  Thats why when a Graf is booted out of the Fatherland hes got to creep back somehow or be a wandering Jew for the rest of time
Blenkiron lit another cigar and fixed me with his steady ruminating eye
For eight years the man has slaved body and soul for the men who degraded him
Hes earned his restoration and I daresay hes got it in his pocket
If merit was rewarded he should be covered with Iron Crosses and Red Eagles 
He had a pretty good hand to start out with
He knew other countries and he was a dandy at languages
More he had an uncommon gift for living a part
That is real genius Dick however much it gets up against us
Best of all he had a firstclass outfit of brains
I cant say I ever struck a better and Ive come across some bright citizens in my time  And now hes going to win out unless we get mighty busy
There was a knock at the door and the solid figure of Andrew Amos revealed itself
Its time ye was home Miss Mary
It chappit halfeleven as I came up the stairs
Its comin on to rain so Ive brought an umbrelly
One word I said
How old is the man
Just gone thirtysix Blenkiron replied
I turned to Mary who nodded
Younger than you Dick she said wickedly as she got into her big Jaeger coat
Im going to see you home I said
Not allowed
Youve had quite enough of my society for one day
Andrews on escort duty tonight
Blenkiron looked after her as the door closed
I reckon youve got the best girl in the world
Ivery thinks the same I said grimly for my detestation of the man who had made love to Mary fairly choked me
You can see why
Heres this degenerate coming out of his rotten class all pampered and petted and satiated with the easy pleasures of life
He has seen nothing of women except the bad kind and the overfed specimens of his own country
I hate being impolite about females but Ive always considered the German variety uncommon like cows
He has had desperate years of intrigue and danger and consorting with every kind of scallawag
Remember hes a big man and a poet with a brain and an imagination that takes every grade without changing gears
Suddenly he meets something that is as fresh and lovely as a spring flower and has wits too and the steeliest courage and yet is all youth and gaiety
Its a new experience for him a kind of revelation and hes big enough to value her as she should be valued  No Dick I can understand you getting cross but I reckon it an item to the mans credit
Its his blind spot all the same I said
His blind spot Blenkiron repeated solemnly and please God were going to remember that
Next morning in miserable sloppy weather Blenkiron carted me about Paris
We climbed five sets of stairs to a flat away up in Montmartre where I was talked to by a fat man with spectacles and a slow voice and told various things that deeply concerned me
Then I went to a room in the Boulevard St Germain with a little cabinet opening off it where I was shown papers and maps and some figures on a sheet of paper that made me open my eyes
We lunched in a modest cafe tucked away behind the Palais Royal and our companions were two Alsatians who spoke German better than a Boche and had no names  only numbers
In the afternoon I went to a low building beside the Invalides and saw many generals including more than one whose features were familiar in two hemispheres
I told them everything about myself and I was examined like a convict and all particulars about my appearance and manner of speech written down in a book
That was to prepare the way for me in case of need among the vast army of those who work underground and know their chief but do not know each other
The rain cleared before night and Blenkiron and I walked back to the hotel through that lemoncoloured dusk that you get in a French winter
We passed a company of American soldiers and Blenkiron had to stop and stare
I could see that he was stiff with pride though he wouldnt show it
What dyou think of that bunch
he asked
Firstrate stuff I said
The men are all right he drawled critically
But some of the officerboys are a bit puffy
They want fining down
Theyll get it soon enough honest fellows
You dont keep your weight long in this war
Say Dick he said shyly what do you truly think of our Americans
Youve seen a lot of them and Id value your views
His tone was that of a bashful author asking for an opinion on his first book
Ill tell you what I think
Youre constructing a great middle class army and thats the most formidable fighting machine on earth
This kind of war doesnt want the Berserker so much as the quiet fellow with a trained mind and a lot to fight for
The American ranks are filled with all sorts from cowpunchers to college boys but mostly with decent lads that have good prospects in life before them and are fighting because they feel theyre bound to not because they like it
It was the same stock that pulled through your Civil War
We have a middleclass division too  Scottish Territorials mostly clerks and shopmen and engineers and farmers sons
When I first struck them my only crab was that the officers werent much better than the men
Its still true but the men are superexcellent and consequently so are the officers
That division gets top marks in the Boche calendar for sheer fighting devilment  And please God thats what your American armys going to be
You can wash out the old idea of a regiment of scallawags commanded by dukes
That was right enough maybe in the days when you hurrooshed into battle waving a banner but it dont do with high explosives and a couple of million men on each side and a battle front of five hundred miles
The hero of this war is the plain man out of the middle class who wants to get back to his home and is going to use all the brains and grit he possesses to finish the job soon
That sounds about right said Blenkiron reflectively
It pleases me some for youve maybe guessed that I respect the British Army quite a little
Which part of it do you put top
All of its good
The French are keen judges and they give front place to the Scots and the Australians
For myself I think the backbone of the Army is the oldfashioned English county regiments that hardly ever get into the papers Though I dont know if I had to pick but Id take the South Africans
Theres only a brigade of them but theyre hells delight in a battle
But then youll say Im prejudiced
Well drawled Blenkiron youre a mighty Empire anyhow
Ive sojourned up and down it and I cant guess how the oldtime highbrows in your little island came to put it together
But Ill let you into a secret Dick
I read this morning in a noospaper that there was a natural affinity between Americans and the men of the British Dominions
Take it from me there isnt  at least not with this American
I dont understand them one little bit
When I see your lean tall Australians with the sun at the back of their eyes Im looking at men from another planet
Outside you and Peter I never got to fathom a South African
The Canadians live over the fence from us but you mix up a Canuck with a Yank in your remarks and youll get a bat in the eye 
But most of us Americans have gotten a grip on your Old Country
Youll find us mighty respectful to other parts of your Empire but we say anything we damn well please about England
You see we know her that well and like her that well we can be free with her
Its like he concluded as we reached the hotel its like a lot of boys that are getting on in the world and are a bit jealous and standoffish with each other
But theyre all at home with the old man who used to warm them up with a hickory cane even though sometimes in their haste they call him a standpatter
That night at dinner we talked solid business  Blenkiron and I and a young French Colonel from the IIIeme Section at GQG
Blenkiron I remember got very hurt about being called a business man by the Frenchman who thought he was paying him a compliment
Cut it out he said
It is a word thats gone bad with me
Theres just two kind of men those whove gotten sense and those who havent
A big percentage of us Americans make our living by trading but we dont think because a mans in business or even because hes made big money that hes any natural good at every job
Weve made a college professor our President and do what he tells us like little boys though he dont earn more than some of us pay our works manager
You English have gotten business on the brain and think a fellows a dandy at handling your Government if he happens to have made a pile by some flatcatching ramp on your Stock Exchange
It makes me tired
Youre about the best business nation on earth but for Gods sake dont begin to talk about it or youll lose your power
And dont go confusing real business with the ordinary gift of raking in the dollars
Any man with sense could make money if he wanted to but he maynt want
He may prefer the fun of the job and let other people do the looting
I reckon the biggest business on the globe today is the work behind your lines and the way you feed and supply and transport your army
It beats the Steel Corporation and the Standard Oil to a frazzle
But the man at the head of it all dont earn more than a thousand dollars a month 
Your nations getting to worship Mammon Dick
Cut it out
Theres just the one difference in humanity  sense or no sense and most likely you wont find any more sense in the man that makes a billion selling bonds than in his brother Tim that lives in a shack and sells corncobs
Im not speaking out of sinful jealousy for there was a day when I was reckoned a railroad king and I quit with a bigger pile than kings usually retire on
But I havent the sense of old Peter who never even had a bank account  And its sense that wins in this war
The Colonel who spoke good English asked a question about a speech which some politician had made
There isnt all the sense Id like to see at the top said Blenkiron
Theyre fine at smooth words
That wouldnt matter but theyre thinking smooth thoughts
What dyou make of the situation Dick
I think its the worst since First Ypres I said
Everybodys cockawhoop but God knows why
God knows why Blenkiron repeated
I reckon its a simple calculation and you cant deny it any more than a mathematical law
Russia is counted out
The Boche wont get food from her for a good many months but he can get more men and hes got them
Hes fighting only on one foot and hes been able to bring troops and guns west so hes as strong as the Allies now on paper
And hes stronger in reality
Hes got better railways behind him and hes fighting on inside lines and can concentrate fast against any bit of our front
Im no soldier but thats so Dick
The Frenchman smiled and shook his head
All the same they will not pass
They could not when they were two to one in 1914 and they will not now
If we Allies could not break through in the last year when we had many more men how will the Germans succeed now with only equal numbers
Blenkiron did not look convinced
Thats what they all say
I talked to a general last week about the coming offensive and he said he was praying for it to hurry up for he reckoned Fritz would get the fright of his life
Its a good spirit maybe but I dont think its sound on the facts
Weve got two mighty great armies of fine fightingmen but because weve two commands were bound to move ragged like a peal of bells
The Huns got one army and forty years of stiff tradition and whats more hes going all out this time
Hes going to smash our front before America lines up or perish in the attempt  Why do you suppose all the peace racket in Germany has died down and the very men that were talking democracy in the summer are now hot for fighting to a finish
Ill tell you
Its because old Ludendorff has promised them complete victory this spring if they spend enough men and the Boche is a good gambler and is out to risk it
Were not up against a local attack this time
Were standing up to a great nation going bald headed for victory or destruction
If were broken then Americas got to fight a new campaign by herself when shes ready and the Boche has time to make Russia his feedingground and diddle our blockade
That puts another five years on to the war maybe another ten
Are we free and independent peoples going to endure that much

I tell you were tossing to quit before Easter
He turned towards me and I nodded assent
Thats more or less my view I said
We ought to hold but itll be by our teeth and nails
For the next six months well be fighting without any margin
But my friends you put it too gravely cried the Frenchman
We may lose a mile or two of ground  yes
But serious danger is not possible
They had better chances at Verdun and they failed
Why should they succeed now
Because they are staking everything Blenkiron replied
It is the last desperate struggle of a wounded beast and in these struggles sometimes the hunter perishes
Dicks right
Weve got a wasting margin and every extra ounce of weights going to tell
The battles in the field and its also in every corner of every Allied land
Thats why within the next two months weve got to get even with the Wild Birds
The French Colonel  his name was de Valliere  smiled at the name and Blenkiron answered my unspoken question
Im going to satisfy some of your curiosity Dick for Ive put together considerable noos of the menagerie
Germany has a good army of spies outside her borders
We shoot a batch now and then but the others go on working like beavers and they do a mighty deal of harm
Theyre beautifully organized but they dont draw on such good human material as we and I reckon they dont pay in results more than ten cents on a dollar of trouble
But there they are
Theyre the intelligence officers and their business is just to forward noos
Theyre the birds in the cage the  what is it your friend called them
Die Stubenvogel I said
Yes but all the birds arent caged
Theres a few outside the bars and they dont collect noos
They do things
If theres anything desperate theyre put on the job and theyve got power to act without waiting on instructions from home
Ive investigated till my brains tired and I havent made out more than half a dozen whom I can say for certain are in the business
Theres your pal the Portuguese Jew Dick
Anothers a woman in Genoa a princess of some sort married to a Greek financier
Ones the editor of a proAlly upcountry paper in the Argentine
One passes as a Baptist minister in Colorado
One was a police spy in the Tzars Government and is now a redhot revolutionary in the Caucasus
And the biggest of course is Moxon Ivery who in happier times was the Graf von Schwabing
There arent above a hundred people in the world know of their existence and these hundred call them the Wild Birds
Do they work together
I asked
Yes
They each get their own jobs to do but theyre apt to flock together for a big piece of devilment
There were four of them in France a year ago before the battle of the Aisne and they pretty near rotted the French Army
Thats so Colonel
The soldier nodded grimly
They seduced our weary troops and they bought many politicians
Almost they succeeded but not quite
The nation is sane again and is judging and shooting the accomplices at its leisure
But the principals we have never caught
You hear that Dick said Blenkiron
Youre satisfied this isnt a whimsy of a melodramatic old Yank
Ill tell you more
You know how Ivery worked the submarine business from England
Also it was the Wild Birds that wrecked Russia
It was Ivery that paid the Bolshevists to sedooce the Army and the Bolshevists took his money for their own purpose thinking they were playing a deep game when all the time he was grinning like Satan for they were playing his
It was Ivery or some other of the bunch that doped the brigades that broke at Caporetto
If I started in to tell you the history of their doings you wouldnt go to bed and if you did you wouldnt sleep 
Theres just this to it
Every finished subtle devilry that the Boche has wrought among the Allies since August 1914 has been the work of the Wild Birds and more or less organized by Ivery
Theyre worth half a dozen army corps to Ludendorff
Theyre the mightiest poison merchants the world ever saw and theyve the nerve of hell  I dont know I interrupted
Iverys got his soft spot
I saw him in the Tube station
Maybe but hes got the kind of nerve thats wanted
And now I rather fancy hes whistling in his flock Blenkiron consulted a notebook
Pavia  thats the Argentine man  started last month for Europe
He transhipped from a coasting steamer in the West Indies and weve temporarily lost track of him but hes left his huntingground
What do you reckon that means
It means Blenkiron continued solemnly that Ivery thinks the games nearly over
The plays working up for the big climax  And that climax is going to be damnation for the Allies unless we get a move on
Right I said
Thats what Im here for
Whats the move
The Wild Birds mustnt ever go home and the man they call Ivery or Bommaerts or Chelius has to decease
Its a coldblooded proposition but its him or the world thats got to break
But before he quits this earth were bound to get wise about some of his plans and that means that we cant just shoot a pistol at his face
Also weve got to find him first
We reckon hes in Switzerland but that is a state with quite a lot of diversified scenery to lose a man in 
Still I guess well find him
But its the kind of business to plan out as carefully as a battle
Im going back to Berne on my old stunt to boss the show and Im giving the orders
Youre an obedient child Dick so I dont reckon on any trouble that way
Then Blenkiron did an ominous thing
He pulled up a little table and started to lay out Patience cards
Since his duodenum was cured he seemed to have dropped that habit and from his resuming it I gathered that his mind was uneasy
I can see that scene as if it were yesterday  the French colonel in an armchair smoking a cigarette in a long amber holder and Blenkiron sitting primly on the edge of a yellow silk ottoman dealing his cards and looking guiltily towards me
Youll have Peter for company he said
Peters a sad man but he has a great heart and hes been mighty useful to me already
Theyre going to move him to England very soon
The authorities are afraid of him for hes apt to talk wild his health having made him peevish about the British
But theres a deal of redtape in the world and the orders for his repatriation are slow in coming
The speaker winked very slowly and deliberately with his left eye
I asked if I was to be with Peter much cheered at the prospect
Why yes
You and Peter are the collateral in the deal
But the big games not with you
I had a presentiment of something coming something anxious and unpleasant
Is Mary in it
I asked
He nodded and seemed to pull himself together for an explanation
See here Dick
Our main job is to get Ivery back to Allied soil where we can handle him
And theres just the one magnet that can fetch him back
You arent going to deny that
I felt my face getting very red and that ugly hammer began beating in my forehead
Two grave patient eyes met my glare
Im damned if Ill allow it
I cried
Ive some right to a say in the thing
I wont have Mary made a decoy
Its too infernally degrading
It isnt pretty but war isnt pretty and nothing we do is pretty
Id have blushed like a rose when I was young and innocent to imagine the things Ive put my hand to in the last three years
But have you any other way Dick
Im not proud and Ill scrap the plan if you can show me another  Night after night Ive hammered the thing out and I cant hit on a better  Heighho Dick this isnt like you and he grinned ruefully
Youre making yourself a fine argument in favour of celibacy  in time of war anyhow What is it the poet sings
 White hands cling to the bridle rein Slipping the spur from the booted heel  I was as angry as sin but I felt all the time I had no case
Blenkiron stopped his game of Patience sending the cards flying over the carpet and straddled on the hearthrug
Youre never going to be a piker
Whats dooty if you wont carry it to the other side of Hell
Whats the use of yapping about your country if youre going to keep anything back when she calls for it
Whats the good of meaning to win the war if you dont put every cent youve got on your stake
Youll make me think youre like the jacks in your English novels that chuck in their hand and say its up to God and call that seeing it through  No Dick that kind of dooty dont deserve a blessing
You dursnt keep back anything if you want to save your soul
Besides he went on what a girl it is
She cant scare and she cant soil
Shes whitehot youth and innocence and shed take no more harm than clean steel from a muckheap
I knew I was badly in the wrong but my pride was all raw
Im not going to agree till Ive talked to Mary
But Miss Mary has consented he said gently
She made the plan
Next day in clear blue weather that might have been May I drove Mary down to Fontainebleau
We lunched in the inn by the bridge and walked into the forest
I hadnt slept much for I was tortured by what I thought was anxiety for her but which was in truth jealousy of Ivery
I dont think that I would have minded her risking her life for that was part of the game we were both in but I jibbed at the notion of Ivery coming near her again
I told myself it was honourable pride but I knew deep down in me that it was jealousy
I asked her if she had accepted Blenkirons plan and she turned mischievous eyes on me
I knew I should have a scene with you Dick
I told Mr Blenkiron so  Of course I agreed
Im not even very much afraid of it
Im a member of the team you know and I must play up to my form
I cant do a mans work so all the more reason why I should tackle the thing I can do
But I stammered its such a  such a degrading business for a child like you
I cant bear 
It makes me hot to think of it
Her reply was merry laughter
Youre an old Ottoman Dick
You havent doubled Cape Turk yet and I dont believe youre round Seraglio Point
Why women arent the brittle things men used to think them
They never were and the war has made them like whipcord
Bless you my dear were the tougher sex now
Weve had to wait and endure and weve been so beaten on the anvil of patience that weve lost all our megrims
She put her hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eyes
Look at me Dick look at your somedaytobe espoused saint
Im nineteen years of age next August
Before the war I should have only just put my hair up
I should have been the kind of shivering debutante who blushes when shes spoken to and oh
I should have thought such silly silly things about life  Well in the last two years Ive been close to it and to death
Ive nursed the dying
Ive seen souls in agony and in triumph
England has allowed me to serve her as she allows her sons
Oh Im a robust young woman now and indeed I think women were always robuster than men  Dick dear Dick were lovers but were comrades too  always comrades and comrades trust each other
I hadnt anything to say except contrition for I had my lesson
I had been slipping away in my thoughts from the gravity of our task and Mary had brought me back to it
I remember that as we walked through the woodland we came to a place where there were no signs of war
Elsewhere there were men busy felling trees and antiaircraft guns and an occasional transport wagon but here there was only a shallow grassy vale and in the distance bloomed over like a plum in the evening haze the roofs of an old dwellinghouse among gardens
Mary clung to my arm as we drank in the peace of it
That is what lies for us at the end of the road Dick she said softly
And then as she looked I felt her body shiver
She returned to the strange fancy she had had in the St Germains woods three days before
Somewhere its waiting for us and we shall certainly find it 
But first we must go through the Valley of the Shadow  And there is the sacrifice to be made  the best of us
CHAPTER FIFTEEN St Anton Ten days later the porter Joseph Zimmer of Arosa clad in the tough and shapeless trousers of his class but sporting an old velveteen shootingcoat bequeathed to him by a former German master  speaking the guttural tongue of the Grisons and with all his belongings in one massive rucksack came out of the little station of St Anton and blinked in the frosty sunshine
He looked down upon the little old village beside its icebound lake but his business was with the new village of hotels and villas which had sprung up in the last ten years south of the station
He made some halting inquiries of the station people and a cabdriver outside finally directed him to the place he sought  the cottage of the Widow Summermatter where resided an English intern one Peter Pienaar
The porter Joseph Zimmer had had a long and roundabout journey
A fortnight before he had worn the uniform of a British majorgeneral
As such he had been the inmate of an expensive Paris hotel till one morning in grey tweed clothes and with a limp he had taken the ParisMediterranean Express with a ticket for an officers convalescent home at Cannes
Thereafter he had declined in the social scale
At Dijon he had been still an Englishman but at Pontarlier he had become an American bagman of Swiss parentage returning to wind up his fathers estate
At Berne he limped excessively and at Zurich at a little backstreet hotel he became frankly the peasant
For he met a friend there from whom he acquired clothes with that odd rank smell far stronger than Harris tweed which marks the raiment of most Swiss guides and all Swiss porters
He also acquired a new name and an old aunt who a little later received him with open arms and explained to her friends that he was her brothers son from Arosa who three winters ago had hurt his leg woodcutting and had been discharged from the levy
A kindly Swiss gentleman as it chanced had heard of the deserving Joseph and interested himself to find him employment
The said philanthropist made a hobby of the French and British prisoners returned from Germany and had in mind an officer a crabbed South African with a bad leg who needed a servant
He was it seemed an illtempered old fellow who had to be billeted alone and since he could speak German he would be happier with a Swiss native
Joseph haggled somewhat over the wages but on his aunts advice he accepted the job and with a very complete set of papers and a store of readymade reminiscences it took him some time to swot up the names of the peaks and passes he had traversed set out for St Anton having dispatched beforehand a monstrously illspelt letter announcing his coming
He could barely read and write but he was good at maps which he had studied carefully and he noticed with satisfaction that the valley of St Anton gave easy access to Italy
As he journeyed south the reflections of that porter would have surprised his fellow travellers in the stuffy thirdclass carriage
He was thinking of a conversation he had had some days before in a cafe at Dijon with a young Englishman bound for Modane  We had bumped up against each other by chance in that strange flitting when all went to different places at different times asking nothing of each others business
Wake had greeted me rather shamefacedly and had proposed dinner together
I am not good at receiving apologies and Wakes embarrassed me more than they embarrassed him
Im a bit of a cad sometimeshe said
You know Im a better fellow than I sounded that night Hannay
I mumbled something about not talking rot  the conventional phrase
What worried me was that the man was suffering
You could see it in his eyes
But that evening I got nearer Wake than ever before and he and I became true friends for he laid bare his soul before me
That was his trouble that he could lay bare his soul for ordinary healthy folk dont analyse their feelings
Wake did and I think it brought him relief
Dont think I was ever your rival
I would no more have proposed to Mary than I would have married one of her aunts
She was so sure of herself so happy in her singleheartedness that she terrified me
My type of man is not meant for marriage for women must be in the centre of life and we must always be standing aside and looking on
It is a damnable thing to be lefthanded
The trouble about you my dear chap I said is that youre too hard to please
Thats one way of putting it
I should put it more harshly
I hate more than I love
All we humanitarians and pacifists have hatred as our mainspring
Odd isnt it for people who preach brotherly love
But its the truth
Were full of hate towards everything that doesnt square in with our ideas everything that jars on our lady like nerves
Fellows like you are so in love with their cause that theyve no time or inclination to detest what thwarts them
Weve no cause  only negatives and that means hatred and selftorture and a beastly jaundice of soul
Then I knew that Wakes fault was not spiritual pride as I had diagnosed it at Biggleswick
The man was abased with humility
I see more than other people see he went on and I feel more
Thats the curse on me
Youre a happy man and you get things done because you only see one side of a case one thing at a time
How would you like it if a thousand strings were always tugging at you if you saw that every course meant the sacrifice of lovely and desirable things or even the shattering of what you know to be unreplaceable
Im the kind of stuff poets are made of but I havent the poets gift so I stagger about the world lefthanded and gamelegged  Take the war
For me to fight would be worse than for another man to run away
From the bottom of my heart I believe that it neednt have happened and that all war is a blistering iniquity
And yet belief has got very little to do with virtue
Im not as good a man as you Hannay who have never thought out anything in your life
My time in the Labour battalion taught me something
I knew that with all my fine aspirations I wasnt as true a man as fellows whose talk was silly oaths and who didnt care a tinkers curse about their soul
I remember that I looked at him with a sudden understanding
I think I know you
Youre the sort of chap who wont fight for his country because he cant be sure that shes altogether in the right
But hed cheerfully die for her right or wrong
His face relaxed in a slow smile
Queer that you should say that
I think its pretty near the truth
Men like me arent afraid to die but they havent quite the courage to live
Every man should be happy in a service like you when he obeys orders
I couldnt get on in any service
I lack the bump of veneration
I cant swallow things merely because Im told to
My sort are always talking about service but we havent the temperament to serve
Id give all I have to be an ordinary cog in the wheel instead of a confounded outsider who finds fault with the machinery  Take a great violent highhanded fellow like you
You can sink yourself till you become only a name and a number
I couldnt if I tried
Im not sure if I want to either
I cling to the odds and ends that are my own
I wish I had had you in my battalion a year ago I said
No you dont
Id only have been a nuisance
Ive been a Fabian since Oxford but youre a better socialist than me
Im a rancid individualist
But you must be feeling better about the war
I asked
Not a bit of it
Im still lusting for the heads of the politicians that made it and continue it
But I want to help my country
Honestly Hannay I love the old place
More I think than I love myself and thats saying a devilish lot
Short of fighting  which would be the sin against the Holy Spirit for me  Ill do my damnedest
But youll remember Im not used to team work
If Im a jealous player beat me over the head
His voice was almost wistful and I liked him enormously
Blenkiron will see to that I said
Were going to break you to harness Wake and then youll be a happy man
You keep your mind on the game and forget about yourself
Thats the cure for jibbers
As I journeyed to St Anton I thought a lot about that talk
He was quite right about Mary who would never have married him
A man with such an angular soul couldnt fit into anothers
And then I thought that the chief thing about Mary was just her serene certainty
Her eyes had that settled happy look that I remembered to have seen only in one other human face and that was Peters 
But I wondered if Peters eyes were still the same
I found the cottage a little wooden thing which had been left perched on its knoll when the big hotels grew around it
It had a fence in front but behind it was open to the hillside
At the gate stood a bent old woman with a face like a pippin
My makeup must have been good for she accepted me before I introduced myself
God be thanked you are come she cried
The poor lieutenant needed a man to keep him company
He sleeps now as he does always in the afternoon for his leg wearies him in the night 
But he is brave like a soldier  Come I will show you the house for you two will be alone now
Stepping softly she led me indoors pointing with a warning finger to the little bedroom where Peter slept
I found a kitchen with a big stove and a rough floor of planking on which lay some badly cured skins
Off it was a sort of pantry with a bed for me
She showed me the pots and pans for cooking and the stores she had laid in and where to find water and fuel
I will do the marketing daily she said and if you need me my dwelling is half a mile up the road beyond the new church
God be with you young man and be kind to that wounded one
When the Widow Summermatter had departed I sat down in Peters armchair and took stock of the place
It was quiet and simple and homely and through the window came the gleam of snow on the diamond hills
On the table beside the stove were Peters cherished belongings  his buckskin pouch and the pipe which Jannie Grobelaar had carved for him in St Helena an aluminium field matchbox I had given him a cheap largeprint Bible such as padres present to welldisposed privates and an old battered Pilgrims Progress with gaudy pictures
The illustration at which I opened showed Faithful going up to Heaven from the fire of Vanity Fair like a woodcock that has just been flushed
Everything in the room was exquisitely neat and I knew that that was Peter and not the Widow Summermatter
On a peg behind the door hung his muchmended coat and sticking out of a pocket I recognized a sheaf of my own letters
In one corner stood something which I had forgotten about  an invalid chair
The sight of Peters plain little oddments made me feel solemn
I wondered if his eyes would be like Marys now for I could not conceive what life would be for him as a cripple
Very silently I opened the bedroom door and slipped inside
He was lying on a camp bedstead with one of those striped Swiss blankets pulled up round his ears and he was asleep
It was the old Peter beyond doubt
He had the hunters gift of breathing evenly through his nose and the white scar on the deep brown of his forehead was what I had always remembered
The only change since I last saw him was that he had let his beard grow again and it was grey
As I looked at him the remembrance of all we had been through together flooded back upon me and I could have cried with joy at being beside him
Women bless their hearts
can never know what long comradeship means to men it is something not in their lives  something that belongs only to that wild undomesticated world which we forswear when we find our mates
Even Mary understood only a bit of it
I had just won her love which was the greatest thing that ever came my way but if she had entered at that moment I would scarcely have turned my head
I was back again in the old life and was not thinking of the new
Suddenly I saw that Peter was awake and was looking at me
Dick he said in a whisper Dick my old friend
The blanket was tossed off and his long lean arms were stretched out to me
I gripped his hands and for a little we did not speak
Then I saw how woefully he had changed
His left leg had shrunk and from the knee down was like a pipe stem
His face when awake showed the lines of hard suffering and he seemed shorter by half a foot
But his eyes were still like Marys
Indeed they seemed to be more patient and peaceful than in the days when he sat beside me on the buckwaggon and peered over the huntingveld
I picked him up  he was no heavier than Mary  and carried him to his chair beside the stove
Then I boiled water and made tea as we had so often done together
Peter old man I said were on trek again and this is a very snug little rondavel
Weve had many good yarns but this is going to be the best
First of all how about your health
Good Im a strong man again but slow like a hippo cow
I have been lonely sometimes but that is all by now
Tell me of the big battles
But I was hungry for news of him and kept him to his own case
He had no complaint of his treatment except that he did not like Germans
The doctors at the hospital had been clever he said and had done their best for him but nerves and sinews and small bones had been so wrecked that they could not mend his leg and Peter had all the Boers dislike of amputation
One doctor had been in Damaraland and talked to him of those baked sunny places and made him homesick
But he returned always to his dislike of Germans
He had seen them herding our soldiers like brute beasts and the commandant had a face like Stumm and a chin that stuck out and wanted hitting
He made an exception for the great airman Lensch who had downed him
He is a white man that one he said
He came to see me in hospital and told me a lot of things
I think he made them treat me well
He is a big man Dick who would make two of me and he has a round merry face and pale eyes like Frickie Celliers who could put a bullet through a pauws head at two hundred yards
He said he was sorry I was lame for he hoped to have more fights with me
Some woman that tells fortunes had said that I would be the end of him but he reckoned she had got the thing the wrong way on
I hope he will come through this war for he is a good man though a German 
But the others
They are like the fool in the Bible fat and ugly in good fortune and proud and vicious when their luck goes
They are not a people to be happy with
Then he told me that to keep up his spirits he had amused himself with playing a game
He had prided himself on being a Boer and spoken coldly of the British
He had also I gathered imparted many things calculated to deceive
So he left Germany with good marks and in Switzerland had held himself aloof from the other British wounded on the advice of Blenkiron who had met him as soon as he crossed the frontier
I gathered it was Blenkiron who had had him sent to St Anton and in his time there as a disgruntled Boer he had mixed a good deal with Germans
They had pumped him about our air service and Peter had told them many ingenious lies and heard curious things in return
They are working hard Dick he said
Never forget that
The German is a stout enemy and when we beat him with a machine he sweats till he has invented a new one
They have great pilots but never so many good ones as we and I do not think in ordinary fighting they can ever beat us
But you must watch Lensch for I fear him
He has a new machine I hear with great engines and a short wingspread but the wings so cambered that he can climb fast
That will be a surprise to spring upon us
You will say that well soon better it
So we shall but if it was used at a time when we were pushing hard it might make the little difference that loses battles
You mean I said that if we had a great attack ready and had driven all the Boche planes back from our front Lensch and his circus might get over in spite of us and blow the gaff
Yes he said solemnly
Or if we were attacked and had a weak spot Lensch might show the Germans where to get through
I do not think we are going to attack for a long time but I am pretty sure that Germany is going to fling every man against us
That is the talk of my friends and it is not bluff
That night I cooked our modest dinner and we smoked our pipes with the stove door open and the good smell of woodsmoke in our nostrils
I told him of all my doings and of the Wild Birds and Ivery and the job we were engaged on
Blenkirons instructions were that we two should live humbly and keep our eyes and ears open for we were outside suspicion  the cantankerous lame Boer and his loutish servant from Arosa
Somewhere in the place was a rendezvous of our enemies and thither came Chelius on his dark errands
Peter nodded his head sagely I think I have guessed the place
The daughter of the old woman used to pull my chair sometimes down to the village and I have sat in cheap inns and talked to servants
There is a freshwater pan there it is all covered with snow now and beside it there is a big house that they call the Pink Chalet
I do not know much about it except that rich folk live in it for I know the other houses and they are harmless
Also the big hotels which are too cold and public for strangers to meet in
I put Peter to bed and it was a joy to me to look after him to give him his tonic and prepare the hot water bottle that comforted his neuralgia
His behaviour was like a docile childs and he never lapsed from his sunny temper though I could see how his leg gave him hell
They had tried massage for it and given it up and there was nothing for him but to endure till nature and his tough constitution deadened the tortured nerves again
I shifted my bed out of the pantry and slept in the room with him and when I woke in the night as one does the first time in a strange place I could tell by his breathing that he was wakeful and suffering
Next day a bath chair containing a grizzled cripple and pushed by a limping peasant might have been seen descending the long hill to the village
It was clear frosty weather which makes the cheeks tingle and I felt so full of beans that it was hard to remember my game leg
The valley was shut in on the east by a great mass of rocks and glaciers belonging to a mountain whose top could not be seen
But on the south above the snowy firwoods there was a most delicate lacelike peak with a point like a needle
I looked at it with interest for beyond it lay the valley which led to the Staub pass and beyond that was Italy  and Mary
The old village of St Anton had one long narrow street which bent at right angles to a bridge which spanned the river flowing from the lake
Thence the road climbed steeply but at the other end of the street it ran on the level by the waters edge lined with gimcrack boardinghouses now shuttered to the world and a few villas in patches of garden
At the far end just before it plunged into a pinewood a promontory jutted into the lake leaving a broad space between the road and the water
Here were the grounds of a more considerable dwelling  snowcovered laurels and rhododendrons with one or two bigger trees  and just on the wateredge stood the house itself called the Pink Chalet
I wheeled Peter past the entrance on the crackling snow of the highway
Seen through the gaps of the trees the front looked new but the back part seemed to be of some age for I could see high walls broken by few windows hanging over the water
The place was no more a chalet than a donjon but I suppose the name was given in honour of a wooden gallery above the front door
The whole thing was washed in an ugly pink
There were outhouses  garage or stables among the trees  and at the entrance there were fairly recent tracks of an automobile
On our way back we had some very bad beer in a cafe and made friends with the woman who kept it
Peter had to tell her his story and I trotted out my aunt in Zurich and in the end we heard her grievances
She was a true Swiss angry at all the belligerents who had spoiled her livelihood hating Germany most but also fearing her most
Coffee tea fuel bread even milk and cheese were hard to get and cost a ransom
It would take the land years to recover and there would be no more tourists for there was little money left in the world
I dropped a question about the Pink Chalet and was told that it belonged to one Schweigler a professor of Berne an old man who came sometimes for a few days in the summer
It was often let but not now
Asked if it was occupied she remarked that some friends of the Schweiglers  rich people from Basle  had been there for the winter
They come and go in great cars she said bitterly and they bring their food from the cities
They spend no money in this poor place
Presently Peter and I fell into a routine of life as if we had always kept house together
In the morning he went abroad in his chair in the afternoon I would hobble about on my own errands
We sank into the background and took its colour and a less conspicuous pair never faced the eye of suspicion
Once a week a young Swiss officer whose business it was to look after British wounded paid us a hurried visit
I used to get letters from my aunt in Zurich Sometimes with the postmark of Arosa and now and then these letters would contain curiously worded advice or instructions from him whom my aunt called the kind patron
Generally I was told to be patient
Sometimes I had word about the health of my little cousin across the mountains
Once I was bidden expect a friend of the patrons the wise doctor of whom he had often spoken but though after that I shadowed the Pink Chalet for two days no doctor appeared
My investigations were a barren business
I used to go down to the village in the afternoon and sit in an outoftheway cafe talking slow German with peasants and hotel porters but there was little to learn
I knew all there was to hear about the Pink Chalet and that was nothing
A young man who skied stayed for three nights and spent his days on the alps above the firwoods
A party of four including two women was reported to have been there for a night  all ramifications of the rich family of Basle
I studied the house from the lake which should have been nicely swept into icerinks but from lack of visitors was a heap of blown snow
The high old walls of the back part were built straight from the waters edge
I remember I tried a short cut through the grounds to the highroad and was given Good afternoon by a smiling German manservant
One way and another I gathered there were a good many serving men about the place  too many for the infrequent guests
But beyond this I discovered nothing
Not that I was bored for I had always Peter to turn to
He was thinking a lot about South Africa and the thing he liked best was to go over with me every detail of our old expeditions
They belonged to a life which he could think about without pain whereas the war was too near and bitter for him
He liked to hobble outofdoors after the darkness came and look at his old friends the stars
He called them by the words they use on the veld and the first star of morning he called the voorlooper  the little boy who inspans the oxen  a name I had not heard for twenty years
Many a great yarn we spun in the long evenings but I always went to bed with a sore heart
The longing in his eyes was too urgent longing not for old days or far countries but for the health and strength which had once been his pride
one night I told him about Mary
She will be a happy mysie he said but you will need to be very clever with her for women are queer cattle and you and I dont know their ways
They tell me English women do not cook and make clothes like our vrouws so what will she find to do
I doubt an idle woman will be like a mealiefed horse
It was no good explaining to him the kind of girl Mary was for that was a world entirely beyond his ken
But I could see that he felt lonelier than ever at my news
So I told him of the house I meant to have in England when the war was over  an old house in a green hilly country with fields that would carry four head of cattle to the Morgan and furrows of clear water and orchards of plums and apples
And you will stay with us all the time I said
You will have your own rooms and your own boy to look after you and you will help me to farm and we will catch fish together and shoot the wild ducks when they come up from the pans in the evening
I have found a better countryside than the Houtbosch where you and I planned to have a farm
It is a blessed and happy place England
He shook his head
You are a kind man Dick but your pretty mysie wont want an ugly old fellow like me hobbling about her house 
I do not think I will go back to Africa for I should be sad there in the sun
I will find a little place in England and some day I will visit you old friend
That night his stoicism seemed for the first time to fail him
He was silent for a long time and went early to bed where I can vouch for it he did not sleep
But he must have thought a lot in the night time for in the morning he had got himself in hand and was as cheerful as a sandboy
I watched his philosophy with amazement
It was far beyond anything I could have compassed myself
He was so frail and so poor for he had never had anything in the world but his bodily fitness and he had lost that now
And remember he had lost it after some months of glittering happiness for in the air he had found the element for which he had been born
Sometimes he dropped a hint of those days when he lived in the clouds and invented a new kind of battle and his voice always grew hoarse
I could see that he ached with longing for their return
And yet he never had a word of complaint
That was the ritual he had set himself his point of honour and he faced the future with the same kind of courage as that with which he had tackled a wild beast or Lensch himself
Only it needed a far bigger brand of fortitude
Another thing was that he had found religion
I doubt if that is the right way to put it for he had always had it
Men who live in the wilds know they are in the hands of God
But his old kind had been a tattered thing more like heathen superstition though it had always kept him humble
But now he had taken to reading the Bible and to thinking in his lonely nights and he had got a creed of his own
I dare say it was crude enough I am sure it was unorthodox but if the proof of religion is that it gives a man a prop in bad days then Peters was the real thing
He used to ferret about in the Bible and thePilgrims Progress  they were both equally inspired in his eyes  and find texts which he interpreted in his own way to meet his case
He took everything quite literally
What happened three thousand years ago in Palestine might for all he minded have been going on next door
I used to chaff him and tell him that he was like the Kaiser very good at fitting the Bible to his purpose but his sincerity was so complete that he only smiled
I remember one night when he had been thinking about his flying days he found a passage in Thessalonians about the dead rising to meet their Lord in the air and that cheered him a lot
Peter I could see had the notion that his time here wouldnt be very long and he liked to think that when he got his release he would find once more the old rapture
Once when I said something about his patience he said he had got to try to live up to Mr Standfast
He had fixed on that character to follow though he would have preferred Mr ValiantforTruth if he had thought himself good enough
He used to talk about Mr Standfast in his queer way as if he were a friend of us both like Blenkiron 
I tell you I was humbled out of all my pride by the Sight of Peter so uncomplaining and gentle and wise
The Almighty Himself couldnt have made a prig out of him and he never would have thought of preaching
Only once did he give me advice
I had always a liking for short cuts and I was getting a bit restive under the long inaction
One day when I expressed my feelings on the matter Peter upped and read from thePilgrims Progress Some also have wished that the next way to their Fathers house were here that they might be troubled no more with either hills or mountains to go over but the Way is the Way and there is an end
All the same when we got into March and nothing happened I grew pretty anxious
Blenkiron had said we were fighting against time and here were the weeks slipping away
His letters came occasionally always in the shape of communications from my aunt
One told me that I would soon be out of a job for Peters repatriation was just about through and he might get his movement order any day
Another spoke of my little cousin over the hills and said that she hoped soon to be going to a place called Santa Chiara in the Val Saluzzana
I got out the map in a hurry and measured the distance from there to St Anton and pored over the two roads thither  the short one by the Staub Pass and the long one by the Marjolana
These letters made me think that things were nearing a climax but still no instructions came
I had nothing to report in my own messages I had discovered nothing in the Pink Chalet but idle servants I was not even sure if the Pink Chalet were not a harmless villa and I hadnt come within a thousand miles of finding Chelius
All my desire to imitate Peters stoicism didnt prevent me from getting occasionally rattled and despondent
The one thing I could do was to keep fit for I had a notion I might soon want all my bodily strength
I had to keep up my pretence of lameness in the daytime so I used to take my exercise at night
I would sleep in the afternoon when Peter had his siesta and then about ten in the evening after putting him to bed I would slip outofdoors and go for a four or five hours tramp
Wonderful were those midnight wanderings
I pushed up through the snowladen pines to the ridges where the snow lay in great wreaths and scallops till I stood on a crest with a frozen world at my feet and above me a host of glittering stars
Once on a night of full moon I reached the glacier at the valley head scrambled up the moraine to where the ice began and peered fearfully into the spectral crevasses
At such hours I had the earth to myself for there was not a sound except the slipping of a burden of snow from the trees or the crack and rustle which reminded me that a glacier was a moving river
The war seemed very far away and I felt the littleness of our human struggles till I thought of Peter turning from side to side to find ease in the cottage far below me
Then I realized that the spirit of man was the greatest thing in this spacious world 
I would get back about three or four have a bath in the water which had been warming in my absence and creep into bed almost ashamed of having two sound legs when a better man a yard away had but one
Oddly enough at these hours there seemed more life in the Pink Chalet than by day
Once tramping across the lake long after midnight I saw lights in the lakefront in windows which for ordinary were blank and shuttered
Several times I cut across the grounds when the moon was dark
On one such occasion a great car with no lights swept up the drive and I heard low voices at the door
Another time a man ran hastily past me and entered the house by a little door on the eastern side which I had not before noticed 
Slowly the conviction began to grow on me that we were not wrong in marking down this place that things went on within it which it deeply concerned us to discover
But I was puzzled to think of a way
I might butt inside but for all I knew it would be upsetting Blenkirons plans for he had given me no instructions about housebreaking
All this unsettled me worse than ever
I began to lie awake planning some means of entrance 
I would be a peasant from the next valley who had twisted his ankle 
I would go seeking an imaginary cousin among the servants 
I would start a fire in the place and have the doors flung open to zealous neighbours  And then suddenly I got instructions in a letter from Blenkiron
It came inside a parcel of warm socks that arrived from my kind aunt
But the letter for me was not from her
It was in Blenkirons large sprawling hand and the style of it was all his own
He told me that he had about finished his job
He had got his line on Chelius who was the bird he expected and that bird would soon wing its way southward across the mountains for the reason I knew of
Weve got an almighty move on he wrote and please God youre going to hustle some in the next week
Its going better than I ever hoped
But something was still to be done
He had struck a countryman one Clarence Donne a journalist of Kansas City whom he had taken into the business
Him he described as a crackerjack and commended to my esteem
He was coming to St Anton for there was a game afoot at the Pink Chalet which he would give me news of
I was to meet him next evening at nine fifteen at the little door in the east end of the house
For the love of Mike Dick he concluded be on time and do everything Clarence tells you as if he was me
Its a mighty complex affair but you and he have sand enough to pull through
Dont worry about your little cousin
Shes safe and out of the job now
My first feeling was one of immense relief especially at the last words
I read the letter a dozen times to make sure I had its meaning
A flash of suspicion crossed my mind that it might be a fake principally because there was no mention of Peter who had figured large in the other missives
But why should Peter be mentioned when he wasnt on in this piece
The signature convinced me
Ordinarily Blenkiron signed himself in full with a fine commercial flourish
But when I was at the Front he had got into the habit of making a kind of hieroglyphic of his surname to me and sticking JS
after it in a bracket
That was how this letter was signed and it was sure proof it was all right
I spent that day and the next in wild spirits
Peter spotted what was on though I did not tell him for fear of making him envious
I had to be extra kind to him for I could see that he ached to have a hand in the business
Indeed he asked shyly if I couldnt fit him in and I had to lie about it and say it was only another of my aimless circumnavigations of the Pink Chalet
Try and find something where I can help he pleaded
Im pretty strong still though Im lame and I can shoot a bit
I declared that he would be used in time that Blenkiron had promised he would be used but for the life of me I couldnt see how
At nine oclock on the evening appointed I was on the lake opposite the house close in under the shore making my way to the rendezvous
It was a coalblack night for though the air was clear the stars were shining with little light and the moon had not yet risen
With a premonition that I might be long away from food I had brought some slabs of chocolate and my pistol and torch were in my pocket
It was bitter cold but I had ceased to mind weather and I wore my one suit and no overcoat
The house was like a tomb for silence
There was no crack of light anywhere and none of those smells of smoke and food which proclaim habitation
It was an eerie job scrambling up the steep bank east of the place to where the flat of the garden started in a darkness so great that I had to grope my way like a blind man
I found the little door by feeling along the edge of the building
Then I stepped into an adjacent clump of laurels to wait on my companion
He was there before me
Say I heard a rich Middle West voice whisper are you Joseph Zimmer
Im not shouting any names but I guess you are the guy I was told to meet here
Mr Donne
I whispered back
The samehe replied
Shake
I gripped a gloved and mittened hand which drew me towards the door
CHAPTER SIXTEEN I Lie on a Hard Bed The journalist from Kansas City was a man of action
He wasted no words in introducing himself or unfolding his plan of campaign
Youve got to follow me mister and not deviate one inch from my tracks
The explaining part will come later
Theres big business in this shack tonight
He unlocked the little door with scarcely a sound slid the crust of snow from his boots and preceded me into a passage as black as a cellar
The door swung smoothly behind us and after the sharp outofdoors the air smelt stuffy as the inside of a safe
A hand reached back to make sure that I followed
We appeared to be in a flagged passage under the main level of the house
My hobnailed boots slipped on the floor and I steadied myself on the wall which seemed to be of undressed stone
Mr Donne moved softly and assuredly for he was better shod for the job than me and his guiding hand came back constantly to make sure of my whereabouts
I remember that I felt just as I had felt when on that August night I had explored the crevice of the Coolin  the same sense that something queer was going to happen the same recklessness and contentment
Moving a foot at a time with immense care we came to a righthand turning
Two shallow steps led us to another passage and then my groping hands struck a blind wall
The American was beside me and his mouth was close to my ear
Got to crawl now he whispered
You lead mister while I shed this coat of mine
Eight feet on your stomach and then upright
I wriggled through a low tunnel broad enough to take three men abreast but not two feet high
Halfway through I felt suffocated for I never liked holes and I had a momentary anxiety as to what we were after in this cellar pilgrimage
Presently I smelt free air and got on to my knees
Right mister
came a whisper from behind
My companion seemed to be waiting till I was through before he followed
Right I answered and very carefully rose to my feet
Then something happened behind me
There was a jar and a bump as if the roof of the tunnel had subsided
I turned sharply and groped at the mouth
I stuck my leg down and found a block
Donne I said as loud as I dared are you hurt
Where are you
But no answer came
Even then I thought only of an accident
Something had miscarried and I was cut off in the cellars of an unfriendly house away from the man who knew the road and had a plan in his head
I was not so much frightened as exasperated
I turned from the tunnel mouth and groped into the darkness before me
I might as well prospect the kind of prison into which I had blundered
I took three steps  no more
My feet seemed suddenly to go from me and fly upward
So sudden was it that I fell heavy and dead like a log and my head struck the floor with a crash that for a moment knocked me senseless
I was conscious of something falling on me and of an intolerable pressure on my chest
I struggled for breath and found my arms and legs pinned and my whole body in a kind of wooden vice
I was sick with concussion and could do nothing but gasp and choke down my nausea
The cut in the back of my head was bleeding freely and that helped to clear my wits but I lay for a minute or two incapable of thought
I shut my eyes tight as a man does when he is fighting with a swoon
When I opened them there was light
It came from the left side of the room the broad glare of a strong electric torch
I watched it stupidly but it gave me the fillip needed to pick up the threads
I remembered the tunnel now and the Kansas journalist
Then behind the light I saw a face which pulled my flickering senses out of the mire
I saw the heavy ulster and the cap which I had realized though I had not seen outside in the dark laurels
They belonged to the journalist Clarence Donne the trusted emissary of Blenkiron
But I saw his face now and it was that face which I had boasted to Bullivant I could never mistake again upon earth
I did not mistake it now and I remember I had a faint satisfaction that I had made good my word
I had not mistaken it for I had not had the chance to look at it till this moment
I saw with acid clearness the common denominator of all its disguises  the young man who lisped in the seaside villa the stout philanthropist of Biggleswick the pulpy panicstricken creature of the Tube station the trim French staff officer of the Picardy chateau 
I saw more for I saw it beyond the need of disguise
I was looking at von Schwabing the exile who had done more for Germany than any army commander  Marys words came back to me  the most dangerous man in the world 
I was not afraid or brokenhearted at failure or angry  not yet for I was too dazed and awestruck
I looked at him as one might look at some cataclysm of nature which had destroyed a continent
The face was smiling
I am happy to offer you hospitality at last it said
I pulled my wits farther out of the mud to attend to him
The crossbar on my chest pressed less hard and I breathed better
But when I tried to speak the words would not come
We are old friends he went on
We have known each other quite intimately for four years which is a long time in war
I have been interested in you for you have a kind of crude intelligence and you have compelled me to take you seriously
If you were cleverer you would appreciate the compliment
But you were fool enough to think you could beat me and for that you must be punished
Oh no dont flatter yourself you were ever dangerous
You were only troublesome and presumptuous like a mosquito one flicks off ones sleeve
He was leaning against the side of a heavy closed door
He lit a cigar from a little gold tinder box and regarded me with amused eyes
You will have time for reflection so I propose to enlighten you a little
You are an observer of little things
So
Did you ever see a cat with a mouse
The mouse runs about and hides and manoeuvres and thinks it is playing its own game
But at any moment the cat can stretch out its paw and put an end to it
You are the mouse my poor General  for I believe you are one of those funny amateurs that the English call Generals
At any moment during the last nine months I could have put an end to you with a nod
My nausea had stopped and I could understand what he said though I had still no power to reply
Let me explain he went on
I watched with amusement your gambols at Biggleswick
My eyes followed you when you went to the Clyde and in your stupid twistings in Scotland
I gave you rope because you were futile and I had graver things to attend to
I allowed you to amuse yourself at your British Front with childish investigations and to play the fool in Paris
I have followed every step of your course in Switzerland and I have helped your idiotic Yankee friend to plot against myself
While you thought you were drawing your net around me I was drawing mine around you
I assure you it has been a charming relaxation from serious business
I knew the man was lying
Some part was true for he had clearly fooled Blenkiron but I remembered the hurried flight from Biggleswick and Eaucourt SainteAnne when the game was certainly against him
He had me at his mercy and was wreaking his vanity on me
That made him smaller in my eyes and my first awe began to pass
I never cherish rancour you know he said
In my business it is silly to be angry for it wastes energy
But I do not tolerate insolence my dear General
And my country has the habit of doing justice on her enemies
It may interest you to know that the end is not far off
Germany has faced a jealous world in arms and she is about to be justified of her great courage
She has broken up bit by bit the clumsy organization of her opponents
Where is Russia today the steamroller that was to crush us
Where is the poor dupe Rumania
Where is the strength of Italy who was once to do wonders for what she called Liberty
Broken all of them
I have played my part in that work and now the need is past
My country with free hands is about to turn upon your armed rabble in the West and drive it into the Atlantic
Then we shall deal with the ragged remains of France and the handful of noisy Americans
By midsummer there will be peace dictated by triumphant Germany
By God there wont
I had found my voice at last
By God there will he said pleasantly
It is what you call a mathematical certainty
You will no doubt die bravely like the savage tribes that your Empire used to conquer
But we have the greater discipline and the stronger spirit and the bigger brain
Stupidity is always punished in the end and you are a stupid race
Do not think that your kinsmen across the Atlantic will save you
They are a commercial people and by no means sure of themselves
When they have blustered a little they will see reason and find some means of saving their faces
Their comic President will make a speech or two and write us a solemn Note and we will reply with the serious rhetoric which he loves and then we shall kiss and be friends
You know in your heart that it will be so
A great apathy seemed to settle on me
This bragging did not make me angry and I had no longer any wish to contradict him
It may have been the result of the fall but my mind had stopped working
I heard his voice as one listens casually to the ticking of a clock
I will tell you more he was saying
This is the evening of the 18th day of March
Your generals in France expect an attack but they are not sure where it will come
Some think it may be in Champagne or on the Aisne some at Ypres some at St Quentin
Well my dear General you alone will I take into our confidence
On the morning of the 21st three days from now we attack the right wing of the British Army
In two days we shall be in Amiens
On the third we shall have driven a wedge as far as the sea
Then in a week or so we shall have rolled up your army from the right and presently we shall be in Boulogne and Calais
After that Paris falls and then Peace
I made no answer
The word Amiens recalled Mary and I was trying to remember the day in January when she and I had motored south from that pleasant city
Why do I tell you these things
Your intelligence for you are not altogether foolish will have supplied the answer
It is because your life is over
As your Shakespeare says the rest is silence  No I am not going to kill you
That would be crude and I hate crudities
I am going now on a little journey and when I return in twentyfour hours time you will be my companion
You are going to visit Germany my dear General
That woke me to attention and he noticed it for he went on with gusto
You have heard of the Untergrundbahn
No
And you boast of an Intelligence service
Yet your ignorance is shared by the whole of your General Staff
It is a little organization of my own
By it we can take unwilling and dangerous people inside our frontier to be dealt with as we please
Some have gone from England and many from France
Officially I believe they are recorded as missing but they did not go astray on any battlefield
They have been gathered from their homes or from hotels or offices or even the busy streets
I will not conceal from you that the service of our Underground Railway is a little irregular from England and France
But from Switzerland it is smooth as a trunk line
There are unwatched spots on the frontier and we have our agents among the frontier guards and we have no difficulty about passes
It is a pretty device and you will soon be privileged to observe its working 
In Germany I cannot promise you comfort but I do not think your life will be dull
As he spoke these words his urbane smile changed to a grin of impish malevolence
Even through my torpor I felt the venom and I shivered
When I return I shall have another companion
His voice was honeyed again
There is a certain pretty lady who was to be the bait to entice me into Italy
It was so
Well I have fallen to the bait
I have arranged that she shall meet me this very night at a mountain inn on the Italian side
I have arranged too that she shall be alone
She is an innocent child and I do not think that she has been more than a tool in the clumsy hands of your friends
She will come with me when I ask her and we shall be a merry party in the Underground Express
My apathy vanished and every nerve in me was alive at the words
You cur
I cried
She loathes the sight of you
She wouldnt touch you with the end of a bargepole
He flicked the ash from his cigar
I think you are mistaken
I am very persuasive and I do not like to use compulsion with a woman
But willing or not she will come with me
I have worked hard and I am entitled to my pleasure and I have set my heart on that little lady
There was something in his tone gross leering assured half contemptuous that made my blood boil
He had fairly got me on the raw and the hammer beat violently in my forehead
I could have wept with sheer rage and it took all my fortitude to keep my mouth shut
But I was determined not to add to his triumph
He looked at his watch
Time passes he said
I must depart to my charming assignation
I will give your remembrances to the lady
Forgive me for making no arrangements for your comfort till I return
Your constitution is so sound that it will not suffer from a days fasting
To set your mind at rest I may tell you that escape is impossible
This mechanism has been proved too often and if you did break loose from it my servants would deal with you
But I must speak a word of caution
If you tamper with it or struggle too much it will act in a curious way
The floor beneath you covers a shaft which runs to the lake below
Set a certain spring at work and you may find yourself shot down into the water far below the ice where your body will rot till the spring  That of course is an alternative open to you if you do not care to wait for my return
He lit a fresh cigar waved his hand and vanished through the doorway
As it shut behind him the sound of his footsteps instantly died away
The walls must have been as thick as a prisons
I suppose I was what people in books call stunned
The illumination during the past few minutes had been so dazzling that my brain could not master it
I remember very clearly that I did not think about the ghastly failure of our scheme or the German plans which had been insolently unfolded to me as to one dead to the world
I saw a single picture  an inn in a snowy valley I saw it as a small place like Peters cottage a solitary girl that smiling devil who had left me and then the unknown terror of the Underground Railway
I think my courage went for a bit and I cried with feebleness and rage
The hammer in my forehead had stopped for it only beat when I was angry in action
Now that I lay trapped the manhood had slipped out of my joints and if Ivery had still been in the doorway I think I would have whined for mercy
I would have offered him all the knowledge I had in the world if he had promised to leave Mary alone
Happily he wasnt there and there was no witness of my cowardice
Happily too it is just as difficult to be a coward for long as to be a hero
It was Blenkirons phrase about Mary that pulled me together  She cant scare and she cant soil
No by heavens she couldnt
I could trust my lady far better than I could trust myself
I was still sick with anxiety but I was getting a pull on myself
I was done in but Ivery would get no triumph out of me
Either I would go under the ice or I would find a chance of putting a bullet through my head before I crossed the frontier
If I could do nothing else I could perish decently  And then I laughed and I knew I was past the worst
What made me laugh was the thought of Peter
I had been pitying him an hour ago for having only one leg but now he was abroad in the living breathing world with years before him and I lay in the depths limbless and lifeless with my number up
I began to muse on the cold water under the ice where I could go if I wanted
I did not think that I would take that road for a mans chances are not gone till he is stone dead but I was glad the way existed  And then I looked at the wall in front of me and very far up I saw a small square window
The stars had been clouded when I entered that accursed house but the mist must have cleared
I saw my old friend Orion the hunters star looking through the bars
And that suddenly made me think
Peter and I had watched them by night and I knew the place of all the chief constellations in relation to the St Anton valley
I believed that I was in a room on the lake side of the Pink Chalet I must be if Ivery had spoken the truth
But if so I could not conceivably see Orion from its window 
There was no other possible conclusion I must be in a room on the east side of the house and Ivery had been lying
He had already lied in his boasting of how he had outwitted me in England and at the Front
He might be lying about Mary  No I dismissed that hope
Those words of his had rung true enough
I thought for a minute and concluded that he had lied to terrorize me and keep me quiet therefore this infernal contraption had probably its weak point
I reflected too that I was pretty strong far stronger probably than Ivery imagined for he had never seen me stripped
Since the place was pitch dark I could not guess how the thing worked but I could feel the crossbars rigid on my chest and legs and the sidebars which pinned my arms to my sides 
I drew a long breath and tried to force my elbows apart
Nothing moved nor could I raise the bars on my legs the smallest fraction
Again I tried and again
The sidebar on my right seemed to be less rigid than the others
I managed to get my right hand raised above the level of my thigh and then with a struggle I got a grip with it on the crossbar which gave me a small leverage
With a mighty effort I drove my right elbow and shoulder against the sidebar
It seemed to give slightly 
I summoned all my strength and tried again
There was a crack and then a splintering the massive bar shuffled limply back and my right arm was free to move laterally though the crossbar prevented me from raising it
With some difficulty I got at my coat pocket where reposed my electric torch and my pistol
With immense labour and no little pain I pulled the former out and switched it on by drawing the catch against the crossbar
Then I saw my prison house
It was a little square chamber very high with on my left the massive door by which Ivery had departed
The dark baulks of my rack were plain and I could roughly make out how the thing had been managed
Some spring had tilted up the flooring and dropped the framework from its place in the righthand wall
It was clamped I observed by an arrangement in the floor just in front of the door
If I could get rid of that catch it would be easy to free myself for to a man of my strength the weight would not be impossibly heavy
My fortitude had come back to me and I was living only in the moment choking down any hope of escape
My first job was to destroy the catch that clamped down the rack and for that my only weapon was my pistol
I managed to get the little electric torch jammed in the corner of the crossbar where it lit up the floor towards the door
Then it was hells own business extricating the pistol from my pocket
Wrist and fingers were always cramping and I was in terror that I might drop it where I could not retrieve it
I forced myself to think out calmly the question of the clamp for a pistol bullet is a small thing and I could not afford to miss
I reasoned it out from my knowledge of mechanics and came to the conclusion that the centre of gravity was a certain bright spot of metal which I could just see under the crossbars
It was bright and so must have been recently repaired and that was another reason for thinking it important
The question was how to hit it for I could not get the pistol in line with my eye
Let anyone try that kind of shooting with a bent arm over a bar when you are lying flat and looking at the mark from under the bar and he will understand its difficulties
I had six shots in my revolver and I must fire two or three ranging shots in any case
I must not exhaust all my cartridges for I must have a bullet left for any servant who came to pry and I wanted one in reserve for myself
But I did not think shots would be heard outside the room the walls were too thick
I held my wrist rigid above the crossbar and fired
The bullet was an inch to the right of the piece of bright steel
Moving a fraction I fired again
I had grazed it on the left
With aching eyes glued on the mark I tried a third time
I saw something leap apart and suddenly the whole framework under which I lay fell loose and mobile 
I was very cool and restored the pistol to my pocket and took the torch in my hand before I moved  Fortune had been kind for I was free
I turned on my face humped my back and without much trouble crawled out from under the contraption
I did not allow myself to think of ultimate escape for that would only flurry me and one step at a time was enough
I remember that I dusted my clothes and found that the cut in the back of my head had stopped bleeding
I retrieved my hat which had rolled into a corner when I fell  Then I turned my attention to the next step
The tunnel was impossible and the only way was the door
If I had stopped to think I would have known that the chances against getting out of such a house were a thousand to one
The pistol shots had been muffled by the cavernous walls but the place as I knew was full of servants and even if I passed the immediate door I would be collared in some passage
But I had myself so well in hand that I tackled the door as if I had been prospecting to sink a new shaft in Rhodesia
It had no handle nor so far as I could see a keyhole 
But I noticed as I turned my torch on the ground that from the clamp which I had shattered a brass rod sunk in the floor led to one of the doorposts
Obviously the thing worked by a spring and was connected with the mechanism of the rack
A wild thought entered my mind and brought me to my feet
I pushed the door and it swung slowly open
The bullet which freed me had released the spring which controlled it
Then for the first time against all my maxims of discretion I began to hope
I took off my hat and felt my forehead burning so that I rested it for a moment on the cool wall  Perhaps my luck still held
With a rush came thoughts of Mary and Blenkiron and Peter and everything we had laboured for and I was mad to win
I had no notion of the interior of the house or where lay the main door to the outer world
My torch showed me a long passage with something like a door at the far end but I clicked it off for I did not dare to use it now
The place was deadly quiet
As I listened I seemed to hear a door open far away and then silence fell again
I groped my way down the passage till I had my hands on the far door
I hoped it might open on the hall where I could escape by a window or a balcony for I judged the outer door would be locked
I listened and there came no sound from within
It was no use lingering so very stealthily I turned the handle and opened it a crack
It creaked and I waited with beating heart on discovery for inside I saw the glow of light
But there was no movement so it must be empty
I poked my head in and then followed with my body
It was a large room with logs burning in a stove and the floor thick with rugs
It was lined with books and on a table in the centre a readinglamp was burning
Several dispatchboxes stood on the table and there was a little pile of papers
A man had been here a minute before for a halfsmoked cigar was burning on the edge of the inkstand
At that moment I recovered complete use of my wits and all my selfpossession
More there returned to me some of the old devil maycareness which before had served me well
Ivery had gone but this was his sanctum
just as on the roofs of Erzerum I had burned to get at Stumms papers so now it was borne in on me that at all costs I must look at that pile
I advanced to the table and picked up the topmost paper
It was a little typewritten blue slip with the lettering in italics and in a corner a curious involved stamp in red ink
On it I read Die Wildvogel missen beimkehren
At the same moment I heard steps and the door opened on the far side I stepped back towards the stove and fingered the pistol in my pocket
A man entered a man with a scholars stoop an unkempt beard and large sleepy dark eyes
At the sight of me he pulled up and his whole body grew taut
It was the Portuguese Jew whose back I had last seen at the smithy door in Skye and who by the mercy of God had never seen my face
I stopped fingering my pistol for I had an inspiration
Before he could utter a word I got in first
Die Vogelein schwei igem im Walde I said
His face broke into a pleasant smile and he replied Warte nur balde rubest du auch
Ach he said in German holding out his hand you have come this way when we thought you would go by Modane
I welcome you for I know your exploits
You are Conradi who did so nobly in Italy
I bowed
Yes I am Conradi I said
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The Col of the Swallows He pointed to the slip on the table
You have seen the orders
I nodded
The long days work is over
You must rejoice for your part has been the hardest I think
Some day you will tell me about it
The mans face was honest and kindly rather like that of the engineer Gaudian whom two years before I had met in Germany
But his eyes fascinated me for they were the eyes of the dreamer and fanatic who would not desist from his quest while life lasted
I thought that Ivery had chosen well in his colleague
My task is not done yet I said
I came here to see Chelius
He will be back tomorrow evening
Too late
I must see him at once
He has gone to Italy and I must overtake him
You know your duty best he said gravely
But you must help me
I must catch him at Santa Chiara for it is a business of life and death
Is there a car to be had
There is mine
But there is no chauffeur
Chelius took him
I can drive myself and I know the road
But I have no pass to cross the frontier
That is easily supplied he said smiling
in one bookcase there was a shelf of dummy books
He unlocked this and revealed a small cupboard whence he took a tin dispatch box
From some papers he selected one which seemed to be already signed
Name
he asked
Call me Hans Gruber of Brieg I said
I travel to pick up my master who is in the timber trade
And your return
I will come back by my old road I said mysteriously and if he knew what I meant it was more than I did myself
He completed the paper and handed it to me
This will take you through the frontier posts
And now for the car
The servants will be in bed for they have been preparing for a long journey but I will myself show it you
There is enough petrol on board to take you to Rome
He led me through the hall unlocked the front door and we crossed the snowy lawn to the garage
The place was empty but for a great car which bore the marks of having come from the muddy lowlands
To my joy I saw that it was a Daimler a type with which I was familiar
I lit the lamps started the engine and ran it out on to the road
You will want an overcoat he said
I never wear them
Food
I have some chocolate
I will breakfast at Santa Chiara
Well God go with you
A minute later I was tearing along the lakeside towards St Anton village
I stopped at the cottage on the hill
Peter was not yet in bed
I found him sitting by the fire trying to read but I saw by his face that he had been waiting anxiously on my coming
Were in the soup old man I said as I shut the door
In a dozen sentences I told him of the nights doings of Iverys plan and my desperate errand
You wanted a share I cried
Well everything depends on you now
Im off after Ivery and God knows what will happen
Meantime you have got to get on to Blenkiron and tell him what Ive told you
He must get the news through to GHQ
somehow
He must trap the Wild Birds before they go
I dont know how but he must
Tell him its all up to him and you for Im out of it
I must save Mary and if Gods willing Ill settle with Ivery
But the big job is for Blenkiron  and you
Somehow he has made a bad break and the enemy has got ahead of him
He must sweat blood to make Up
My God Peter its the solemnest moment of our lives
I dont see any light but we mustnt miss any chances
Im leaving it all to you
I spoke like a man in a fever for after what I had been through I wasnt quite sane
My coolness in the Pink Chalet had given place to a crazy restlessness
I can see Peter yet standing in the ring of lamplight supporting himself by a chair back wrinkling his brows and as he always did in moments of excitement scratching gently the tip of his left ear
His face was happy
Never fear Dick he said
It will all come right
Ons sal n plan maak
And then still possessed with a demon of disquiet I was on the road again heading for the pass that led to Italy
The mist had gone from the sky and the stars were shining brightly
The moon now at the end of its first quarter was setting in a gap of the mountains as I climbed the low col from the St Anton valley to the greater Staubthal
There was frost and the hard snow crackled under my wheels but there was also that feel in the air which preludes storm
I wondered if I should run into snow in the high hills
The whole land was deep in peace
There was not a light in the hamlets I passed through not a soul on the highway
In the Staubthal I joined the main road and swung to the left up the narrowing bed of the valley
The road was in noble condition and the car was running finely as I mounted through forests of snowy Pines to a land where the mountains crept close together and the highway coiled round the angles of great crags or skirted perilously some profound gorge with only a line of wooden posts to defend it from the void
In places the snow stood in walls on either side where the road was kept open by mans labour
In other parts it lay thin and in the dim light one might have fancied that one was running through open meadowlands
Slowly my head was getting clearer and I was able to look round my problem
I banished from my mind the situation I had left behind me
Blenkiron must cope with that as best he could
It lay with him to deal with the Wild Birds my job was with Ivery alone
Sometime in the early morning he would reach Santa Chiara and there he would find Mary
Beyond that my imagination could forecast nothing
She would be alone  I could trust his cleverness for that he would try to force her to come with him or he might persuade her with some lying story
Well please God I should come in for the tail end of the interview and at the thought I cursed the steep gradients I was climbing and longed for some magic to lift the Daimler beyond the summit and set it racing down the slope towards Italy
I think it was about halfpast three when I saw the lights of the frontier post
The air seemed milder than in the valleys and there was a soft scurry of snow on my right cheek
A couple of sleepy Swiss sentries with their rifles in their hands stumbled out as I drew up
They took my pass into the hut and gave me an anxious quarter of an hour while they examined it
The performance was repeated fifty yards on at the Italian post where to my alarm the sentries were inclined to conversation
I played the part of the sulky servant answering in monosyllables and pretending to immense stupidity
You are only just in time friend said one in German
The weather grows bad and soon the pass will close
Ugh it is as cold as last winter on the Tonale
You remember Giuseppe
But in the end they let me move on
For a little I felt my way gingerly for on the summit the road had many twists and the snow was confusing to the eyes
Presently came a sharp drop and I let the Daimler go
It grew colder and I shivered a little the snow became a wet white fog around the glowing arc of the headlights and always the road fell now in long curves now in steep short dips till I was aware of a glen opening towards the south
From long living in the wilds I have a kind of sense for landscape without the testimony of the eyes and I knew where the ravine narrowed or widened though it was black darkness
In spite of my restlessness I had to go slowly for after the first rush downhill I realized that unless I was careful I might wreck the car and spoil everything
The surface of the road on the southern slope of the mountains was a thousand per cent worse than that on the other
I skidded and sideslipped and once grazed the edge of the gorge
It was far more maddening than the climb up for then it had been a straightforward grind with the Daimler doing its utmost whereas now I had to hold her back because of my own lack of skill
I reckon that time crawling down from the summit of the Staub as some of the weariest hours I ever spent
Quite suddenly I ran out of the ill weather into a different climate
The sky was clear above me and I saw that dawn was very near
The first pinewoods were beginning and at last came a straight slope where I could let the car out
I began to recover my spirits which had been very dashed and to reckon the distance I had still to travel  And then without warning a new world sprang up around me
Out of the blue dusk white shapes rose like ghosts peaks and needles and domes of ice their bases fading mistily into shadow but the tops kindling till they glowed like jewels
I had never seen such a sight and the wonder of it for a moment drove anxiety from my heart
More it gave me an earnest of victory
I was in clear air once more and surely in this diamond ether the foul things which loved the dark must be worsted  And then I saw a mile ahead the little square redroofed building which I knew to be the inn of Santa Chiara
It was here that misfortune met me
I had grown careless now and looked rather at the house than the road
At one point the hillside had slipped down  it must have been recent for the road was well kept  and I did not notice the landslide till I was on it
I slewed to the right took too wide a curve and before I knew the car was over the far edge
I slapped on the brakes but to avoid turning turtle I had to leave the road altogether
I slithered down a steep bank into a meadow where for my sins I ran into a fallen tree trunk with a jar that shook me out of my seat and nearly broke my arm
Before I examined the car I knew what had happened
The front axle was bent and the off front wheel badly buckled
I had not time to curse my stupidity
I clambered back to the road and set off running down it at my best speed
I was mortally stiff for Iverys rack was not good for the joints but I realized it only as a drag on my pace not as an affliction in itself
My whole mind was set on the house before me and what might be happening there
There was a man at the door of the inn who when he caught sight of my figure began to move to meet me
I saw that it was Launcelot Wake and the sight gave me hope
But his face frightened me
It was drawn and haggard like one who never sleeps and his eyes were hot coals
Hannay he cried for Gods sake what does it mean
Where is Mary
I gasped and I remember I clutched at a lapel of his coat
He pulled me to the low stone wall by the roadside
I dont know he said hoarsely
We got your orders to come here this morning
We were at Chiavagno where Blenkiron told us to wait
But last night Mary disappeared 
I found she had hired a carriage and come on ahead
I followed at once and reached here an hour ago to find her gone 
The woman who keeps the place is away and there are only two old servants left
They tell me that Mary came here late and that very early in the morning a closed car came over the Staub with a man in it
They say he asked to see the young lady and that they talked together for some time and that then she went off with him in the car down the valley 
I must have passed it on my way up 
Theres been some black devilment that I cant follow
Who was the man
Who was the man
He looked as if he wanted to throttle me
I can tell you that I said
It was Ivery
He stared for a second as if he didnt understand
Then he leaped to his feet and cursed like a trooper
Youve botched it as I knew you would
I knew no good would come of your infernal subtleties
And he consigned me and Blenkiron and the British army and Ivery and everybody else to the devil
I was past being angry
Sit down man I said and listen to me
I told him of what had happened at the Pink Chalet
He heard me out with his head in his hands
The thing was too bad for cursing
The Underground Railway
he groaned
The thought of it drives me mad
Why are you so calm Hannay
Shes in the hands of the cleverest devil in the world and you take it quietly
You should be a raving lunatic
I would be if it were any use but I did all my raving last night in that den of Iverys
Weve got to pull ourselves together Wake
First of all I trust Mary to the other side of eternity
She went with him of her own free will
I dont know why but she must have had a reason and be sure it was a good one for shes far cleverer than you or me  Weve got to follow her somehow
Iverys bound for Germany but his route is by the Pink Chalet for he hopes to pick me up there
He went down the valley therefore he is going to Switzerland by the Marjolana
That is a long circuit and will take him most of the day
Why he chose that way I dont know but there it is
Weve got to get back by the Staub
How did you come
he asked
Thats our damnable luck
I came in a firstclass sixcylinder Daimler which is now lying a wreck in a meadow a mile up the road
Weve got to foot it
We cant do it
It would take too long
Besides theres the frontier to pass
I remembered ruefully that I might have got a return passport from the Portuguese Jew if I had thought of anything at the time beyond getting to Santa Chiara
Then we must make a circuit by the hillside and dodge the guards
Its no use making difficulties Wake
Were fairly up against it but weve got to go on trying till we drop
Otherwise Ill take your advice and go mad
And supposing you get back to St Anton youll find the house shut up and the travellers gone hours before by the Underground Railway
Very likely
But man theres always the glimmering of a chance
Its no good chucking in your hand till the games out
Drop your proverbial philosophy Mr Martin Tupper and look up there
He had one foot on the wall and was staring at a cleft in the snowline across the valley
The shoulder of a high peak dropped sharply to a kind of nick and rose again in a long graceful curve of snow
All below the nick was still in deep shadow but from the configuration of the slopes I judged that a tributary glacier ran from it to the main glacier at the river head
Thats the Colle delle Rondini he said the Col of the Swallows
It leads straight to the Staubthal near Grunewald
On a good day I have done it in seven hours but its not a pass for wintertime
It has been done of course but not often

Yet if the weather held it might go even now and that would bring us to St Anton by the evening
I wonder  and he looked me over with an appraising eye I wonder if youre up to it
My stiffness had gone and I burned to set my restlessness to physical toil
If you can do it I can I said
No
There youre wrong
Youre a hefty fellow but youre no mountaineer and the ice of the Colle delle Rondini needs knowledge
It would be insane to risk it with a novice if there were any other way
But Im damned if I see any and Im going to chance it
We can get a rope and axes in the inn
Are you game
Right you are
Seven hours you say
Weve got to do it in six
You will be humbler when you get on the ice he said grimly
Wed better breakfast for the Lord knows when we shall see food again
We left the inn at five minutes to nine with the sky cloudless and a stiff wind from the northwest which we felt even in the deepcut valley
Wake walked with a long slow stride that tried my patience
I wanted to hustle but he bade me keep in step
You take your orders from me for Ive been at this job before
Discipline in the ranks remember
We crossed the river gorge by a plank bridge and worked our way up the right bank past the moraine to the snout of the glacier
It was bad going for the snow concealed the boulders and I often floundered in holes
Wake never relaxed his stride but now and then he stopped to sniff the air
I observed that the weather looked good and he differed
Its too clear
Therell be a fullblown gale on the Col and most likely snow in the afternoon
He pointed to a fat yellow cloud that was beginning to bulge over the nearest peak
After that I thought he lengthened his stride
Lucky I had these boots resoled and nailed at Chiavagno was the only other remark he made till we had passed the seracs of the main glacier and turned up the lesser icestream from the Colle delle Rondini
By halfpast ten we were near its head and I could see clearly the ribbon of pure ice between black crags too steep for snow to lie on which was the means of ascent to the Col
The sky had clouded over and ugly streamers floated on the high slopes
We tied on the rope at the foot of the bergschrund which was easy to pass because of the winters snow
Wake led of course and presently we came on to the icefall
In my time I had done a lot of scrambling on rocks and used to promise myself a season in the Alps to test myself on the big peaks
If I ever go it will be to climb the honest rock towers around Chamonix for I wont have anything to do with snow mountains
That day on the Colle delle Rondini fairly sickened me of ice
I daresay I might have liked it if I had done it in a holiday mood at leisure and in good spirits
But to crawl up that couloir with a sick heart and a desperate impulse to hurry was the worst sort of nightmare
The place was as steep as a wall of smooth black ice that seemed hard as granite
Wake did the stepcutting and I admired him enormously
He did not seem to use much force but every step was hewn cleanly the right size and they were spaced the right distance
In this job he was the true professional
I was thankful Blenkiron was not with us for the thing would have given a squirrel vertigo
The chips of ice slithered between my legs and I could watch them till they brought up just above the bergschrund
The ice was in shadow and it was bitterly cold
As we crawled up I had not the exercise of using the axe to warm me and I got very numb standing on one leg waiting for the next step
Worse still my legs began to cramp
I was in good condition but that time under Iverys rack had played the mischief with my limbs
Muscles got out of place in my calves and stood in aching lumps till I almost squealed with the pain of it
I was mortally afraid I should slip and every time I moved I called out to Wake to warn him
He saw what was happening and got the pick of his axe fixed in the ice before I was allowed to stir
He spoke often to cheer me up and his voice had none of its harshness
He was like some ill tempered generals I have known very gentle in a battle
At the end the snow began to fall a soft powder like the overspill of a storm raging beyond the crest
It was just after that that Wake cried out that in five minutes we would be at the summit
He consulted his wristwatch
Jolly good time too
Only twentyfive minutes behind my best
Its not one oclock
The next I knew I was lying flat on a pad of snow easing my cramped legs while Wake shouted in my ear that we were in for something bad
I was aware of a driving blizzard but I had no thought of anything but the blessed relief from pain
I lay for some minutes on my back with my legs stiff in the air and the toes turned inwards while my muscles fell into their proper place
It was certainly no spot to linger in
We looked down into a trough of driving mist which sometimes swirled aside and showed a knuckle of black rock far below
We ate some chocolate while Wake shouted in my ear that now we had less stepcutting
He did his best to cheer me but he could not hide his anxiety
Our faces were frosted over like a weddingcake and the sting of the wind was like a whiplash on our eyelids
The first part was easy down a slope of firm snow where steps were not needed
Then came ice again and we had to cut into it below the fresh surface snow
This was so laborious that Wake took to the rocks on the right side of the couloir where there was some shelter from the main force of the blast
I found it easier for I knew something about rocks but it was difficult enough with every handhold and foothold glazed
Presently we were driven back again to the ice and painfully cut our way through a throat of the ravine where the sides narrowed
There the wind was terrible for the narrows made a kind of funnel and we descended plastered against the wall and scarcely able to breathe while the tornado plucked at our bodies as if it would whisk us like wisps of grass into the abyss
After that the gorge widened and we had an easier slope till suddenly we found ourselves perched on a great tongue of rock round which the snow blew like the froth in a whirlpool
As we stopped for breath Wake shouted in my ear that this was the Black Stone
The what
I yelled
The Schwarzstein
The Swiss call the pass the Schwarzsteinthor
You can see it from Grunewald
I suppose every man has a tinge of superstition in him
To hear that name in that ferocious place gave me a sudden access of confidence
I seemed to see all my doings as part of a great predestined plan
Surely it was not for nothing that the word which had been the key of my first adventure in the long tussle should appear in this last phase
I felt new strength in my legs and more vigour in my lungs
A good omen I shouted
Wake old man were going to win out
The worst is still to come he said
He was right
To get down that tongue of rock to the lower snows of the couloir was a job that fairly brought us to the end of our tether
I can feel yet the sour bleak smell of wet rock and ice and the hard nerve pain that racked my forehead
The Kaffirs used to say that there were devils in the high berg and this place was assuredly given over to the powers of the air who had no thought of human life
I seemed to be in the world which had endured from the eternity before man was dreamed of
There was no mercy in it and the elements were pitting their immortal strength against two pigmies who had profaned their sanctuary
I yearned for warmth for the glow of a fire for a tree or blade of grass or anything which meant the sheltered homeliness of mortality
I knew then what the Greeks meant by panic for I was scared by the apathy of nature
But the terror gave me a kind of comfort too
Ivery and his doings seemed less formidable
Let me but get out of this cold hell and I could meet him with a new confidence
Wake led for he knew the road and the road wanted knowing
Otherwise he should have been last on the rope for that is the place of the better man in a descent
I had some horrible moments following on when the rope grew taut for I had no help from it
We zigzagged down the rock sometimes driven to the ice of the adjacent couloirs sometimes on the outer ridge of the Black Stone sometimes wriggling down little cracks and over evil boilerplates
The snow did not lie on it but the rock crackled with thin ice or oozed ice water
Often it was only by the grace of God that I did not fall headlong and pull Wake out of his hold to the bergschrund far below
I slipped more than once but always by a miracle recovered myself
To make things worse Wake was tiring
I could feel him drag on the rope and his movements had not the precision they had had in the morning
He was the mountaineer and I the novice
If he gave out we should never reach the valley
The fellow was clear grit all through
When we reached the foot of the tooth and sat huddled up with our faces away from the wind I saw that he was on the edge of fainting
What that effort Must have cost him in the way of resolution you may guess but he did not fail till the worst was past
His lips were colourless and he was choking with the nausea of fatigue
I found a flask of brandy in his pocket and a mouthful revived him
Im all out he said
The roads easier now and I can direct YOU about the rest  Youd better leave me
Ill only be a drag
Ill come on when I feel better
No you dont you old fool
Youve got me over that infernal iceberg and Im going to see you home
I rubbed his arms and legs and made him swallow some chocolate
But when he got on his feet he was as doddery as an old man
Happily we had an easy course down a snow gradient which we glissaded in very unorthodox style
The swift motion freshened him up a little and he was able to put on the brake with his axe to prevent us cascading into the bergschrund
We crossed it by a snow bridge and started out on the seracs of the Schwarzstein glacier
I am no mountaineer  not of the snow and ice kind anyway  but I have a big share of physical strength and I wanted it all now
For those seracs were an invention of the devil
To traverse that labyrinth in a blinding snowstorm with a fainting companion who was too weak to jump the narrowest crevasse and who hung on the rope like lead when there was occasion to use it was more than I could manage
Besides every step that brought us nearer to the valley now increased my eagerness to hurry and wandering in that maze of clotted ice was like the nightmare when you stand on the rails with the express coming and are too weak to climb on the platform
As soon as possible I left the glacier for the hillside and though that was laborious enough in all conscience yet it enabled me to steer a straight course
Wake never spoke a word
When I looked at him his face was ashen under a gale which should have made his cheeks glow and he kept his eyes half closed
He was staggering on at the very limits of his endurance  By and by we were on the moraine and after splashing through a dozen little glacier streams came on a track which led up the hillside
Wake nodded feebly when I asked if this was right
Then to my joy I saw a gnarled pine
I untied the rope and Wake dropped like a log on the ground
Leave me he groaned
Im fairly done
Ill come on later
And he shut his eyes
My watch told me that it was after five oclock
Get on my back I said
I wont part from you till Ive found a cottage
Youre a hero
Youve brought me over those damned mountains in a blizzard and thats what no other man in England would have done
Get up
He obeyed for he was too far gone to argue
I tied his wrists together with a handkerchief below my chin for I wanted my arms to hold up his legs
The rope and axes I left in a cache beneath the pinetree
Then I started trotting down the track for the nearest dwelling
My strength felt inexhaustible and the quicksilver in my bones drove me forward
The snow was still falling but the wind was dying down and after the inferno of the pass it was like summer
The road wound over the shale of the hillside and then into what in spring must have been upland meadows
Then it ran among trees and far below me on the right I could hear the glacier river churning in its gorge Soon little empty huts appeared and rough enclosed paddocks and presently I came out on a shelf above the stream and smelt the woodsmoke of a human habitation
I found a middleaged peasant in the cottage a guide by profession in summer and a woodcutter in winter
I have brought my Herr from Santa Chiara I said over the Schwarzsteinthor
He is very weary and must sleep
I decanted Wake into a chair and his head nodded on his chest
But his colour was better
You and your Herr are fools said the man gruffly but not unkindly
He must sleep or he will have a fever
The Schwarzsteinthor in this devils weather
Is he English
Yes I said like all madmen
But hes a good Herr and a brave mountaineer
We stripped Wake of his Red Cross uniform now a collection of sopping rags and got him between blankets with a huge earthenware bottle of hot water at his feet
The woodcutters wife boiled milk and this with a little brandy added we made him drink
I was quite easy in my mind about him for I had seen this condition before
In the morning he would be as stiff as a poker but recovered
Now Im off for St Anton I said
I must get there tonight
You are the hardy one the man laughed
I will show you the quick road to Grunewald where is the railway
With good fortune you may get the last train
I gave him fifty francs on my Herrs behalf learned his directions for the road and set off after a draught of goats milk munching my last slab of chocolate
I was still strung up to a mechanical activity and I ran every inch of the three miles to the Staubthal without consciousness of fatigue
I was twenty minutes too soon for the train and as I sat on a bench on the platform my energy suddenly ebbed away
That is what happens after a great exertion
I longed to sleep and when the train arrived I crawled into a carriage like a man with a stroke
There seemed to be no force left in my limbs
I realized that I was legweary which is a thing you see sometimes with horses but not often with men
All the journey I lay like a log in a kind of coma and it was with difficulty that I recognized my destination and stumbled out of the train
But I had no sooner emerged from the station of St Anton than I got my second wind
Much snow had fallen since yesterday but it had stopped now the sky was clear and the moon was riding
The sight of the familiar place brought back all my anxieties
The day on the Col of the Swallows was wiped out of my memory and I saw only the inn at Santa Chiara and heard Wakes hoarse voice speaking of Mary
The lights were twinkling from the village below and on the right I saw the clump of trees which held the Pink Chalet
I took a short cut across the fields avoiding the little town
I ran hard stumbling often for though I had got my mental energy back my legs were still precarious
The station clock had told me that it was nearly halfpast nine
Soon I was on the highroad and then at the Chalet gates
I heard as in a dream what seemed to be three shrill blasts on a whistle
Then a big car passed me making for St Anton
For a second I would have hailed it but it was past me and away
But I had a conviction that my business lay in the house for I thought Ivery was there and Ivery was what mattered
I marched up the drive with no sort of plan in my head only a blind rushing on fate
I remembered dimly that I had still three cartridges in my revolver
The front door stood open and I entered and tiptoed down the passage to the room where I had found the Portuguese Jew
No one hindered me but it was not for lack of servants
I had the impression that there were people near me in the darkness and I thought I heard German softly spoken
There was someone ahead of me perhaps the speaker for I could hear careful footsteps
It was very dark but a ray of light came from below the door of the room
Then behind me I heard the hall door clang and the noise of a key turned in its lock
I had walked straight into a trap and all retreat was cut off
My mind was beginning to work more clearly though my purpose was still vague
I wanted to get at Ivery and I believed that he was somewhere in front of me
And then I thought of the door which led from the chamber where I had been imprisoned
If I could enter that way I would have the advantage of surprise
I groped on the righthand side of the passage and found a handle
It opened upon what seemed to be a diningroom for there was a faint smell of food
Again I had the impression of people near who for some unknown reason did not molest me
At the far end I found another door which led to a second room which I guessed to be adjacent to the library
Beyond it again must lie the passage from the chamber with the rack
The whole place was as quiet as a shell
I had guessed right
I was standing in the passage where I had stood the night before
In front of me was the library and there was the same chink of light showing
Very softly I turned the handle and opened it a crack 
The first thing that caught my eye was the profile of Ivery
He was looking towards the writingtable where someone was sitting
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN The Underground Railway This is the story which I heard later from Mary  She was at Milan with the new AngloAmerican hospital when she got Blenkirons letter
Santa Chiara had always been the place agreed upon and this message mentioned specifically Santa Chiara and fixed a date for her presence there
She was a little puzzled by it for she had not yet had a word from Ivery to whom she had written twice by the roundabout address in France which Bommaerts had given her
She did not believe that he would come to Italy in the ordinary course of things and she wondered at Blenkirons certainty about the date
The following morning came a letter from Ivery in which he ardently pressed for a meeting
It was the first of several full of strange talk about some approaching crisis in which the forebodings of the prophet were mingled with the solicitude of a lover
The storm is about to break he wrote and I cannot think only of my own fate
I have something to tell you which vitally concerns yourself
You say you are in Lombardy
The Chiavagno valley is within easy reach and at its head is the inn of Santa Chiara to which I come on the morning of March 19th
Meet me there even if only for half an hour I implore you
We have already shared hopes and confidences and I would now share with you a knowledge which I alone in Europe possess
You have the heart of a lion my lady worthy of what I can bring you
Wake was summoned from the Croce Rossa unit with which he was working at Vicenza and the plan arranged by Blenkiron was faithfully carried out
Four officers of the Alpini in the rough dress of peasants of the hills met them in Chiavagno on the morning of the 18th
It was arranged that the hostess of Santa Chiara should go on a visit to her sisters son leaving the inn now in the shuttered quiet of wintertime under the charge of two ancient servants
The hour of Iverys coming on the 19th had been fixed by him for noon and that morning Mary would drive up the valley while Wake and the Alpini went inconspicuously by other routes so as to be in station around the place before midday
But on the evening of the 18th at the Hotel of the Four Kings in Chiavagno Mary received another message
It was from me and told her that I was crossing the Staub at midnight and would be at the inn before dawn
It begged her to meet me there to meet me alone without the others because I had that to say to her which must be said before Iverys coming
I have seen the letter
It was written in a hand which I could not have distinguished from my own scrawl
It was not exactly what I would myself have written but there were phrases in it which to Marys mind could have come only from me
Oh I admit it was cunningly done especially the lovemaking which was just the kind of stammering thing which I would have achieved if I had tried to put my feelings on paper
Anyhow Mary had no doubt of its genuineness
She slipped off after dinner hired a carriage with two brokenwinded screws and set off up the valley
She left a line for Wake telling him to follow according to the plan  a line which he never got for his anxiety when he found she had gone drove him to immediate pursuit
At about two in the morning of the 19th after a slow and icy journey she arrived at the inn knocked up the aged servants made herself a cup of chocolate out of her teabasket and sat down to wait on my coming
She has described to me that time of waiting
A homemade candle in a tall earthenware candlestick lit up the little salleamanger which was the one room in use
The world was very quiet the snow muffled the roads and it was cold with the penetrating chill of the small hours of a March night
Always she has told me will the taste of chocolate and the smell of burning tallow bring back to her that strange place and the flutter of the heart with which she waited
For she was on the eve of the crisis of all our labours she was very young and youth has a quick fancy which will not be checked
Moreover it was I who was coming and save for the scrawl of the night before we had had no communication for many weeks  She tried to distract her mind by repeating poetry and the thing that came into her head was Keatss Nightingale an odd poem for the time and place
There was a long wicker chair among the furnishings of the room and she lay down on it with her fur cloak muffled around her
There were sounds of movement in the inn
The old woman who had let her in with the scent of intrigue of her kind had brightened when she heard that another guest was coming
Beautiful women do not travel at midnight for nothing
She also was awake and expectant
Then quite suddenly came the sound of a car slowing down outside
She sprang to her feet in a tremor of excitement
It was like the Picardy chateau again  the dim room and a friend coming out of the night
She heard the front door open and a step in the little hall  She was looking at Ivery

He slipped his drivingcoat off as he entered and bowed gravely
He was wearing a green hunting suit which in the dusk seemed like khaki and as he was about my own height for a second she was misled
Then she saw his face and her heart stopped
You
she cried
She had sunk back again on the wicker chair
I have come as I promised he said but a little earlier
You will forgive me my eagerness to be with you
She did not heed his words for her mind was feverishly busy
My letter had been a fraud and this man had discovered our plans
She was alone with him for it would be hours before her friends came from Chiavagno
He had the game in his hands and of all our confederacy she alone remained to confront him
Marys courage was pretty near perfect and for the moment she did not think of herself or her own fate
That came later
She was possessed with poignant disappointment at our failure
All our efforts had gone to the winds and the enemy had won with contemptuous ease
Her nervousness disappeared before the intense regret and her brain set coolly and busily to work
It was a new Ivery who confronted her a man with vigour and purpose in every line of him and the quiet confidence of power
He spoke with a serious courtesy
The time for makebelieve is past he was saying
We have fenced with each other
I have told you only half the truth and you have always kept me at arms length
But you knew in your heart my dearest lady that there must be the full truth between us some day and that day has come
I have often told you that I love you
I do not come now to repeat that declaration
I come to ask you to entrust yourself to me to join your fate to mine for I can promise you the happiness which you deserve
He pulled up a chair and sat beside her
I cannot put down all that he said for Mary once she grasped the drift of it was busy with her own thoughts and did not listen
But I gather from her that he was very candid and seemed to grow as he spoke in mental and moral stature
He told her who he was and what his work had been
He claimed the same purpose as hers a hatred of war and a passion to rebuild the world into decency
But now he drew a different moral
He was a German it was through Germany alone that peace and regeneration could come
His country was purged from her faults and the marvellous German discipline was about to prove itself in the eye of gods and men
He told her what he had told me in the room at the Pink Chalet but with another colouring
Germany was not vengeful or vainglorious only patient and merciful
God was about to give her the power to decide the worlds fate and it was for him and his kind to see that the decision was beneficent
The greater task of his people was only now beginning
That was the gist of his talk
She appeared to listen but her mind was far away
She must delay him for two hours three hours four hours
If not she must keep beside him
She was the only one of our company left in touch with the enemy  I go to Germany now he was saying
I want you to come with me  to be my wife
He waited for an answer and got it in the form of a startled question
To Germany
How
It is easy he said smiling
The car which is waiting outside is the first stage of a system of travel which we have perfected
Then he told her about the Underground Railway  not as he had told it to me to scare but as a proof of power and forethought
His manner was perfect
He was respectful devoted thoughtful of all things
He was the suppliant not the master
He offered her power and pride a dazzling career for he had deserved well of his country the devotion of the faithful lover
He would take her to his mothers house where she would be welcomed like a princess
I have no doubt he was sincere for he had many moods and the libertine whom he had revealed to me at the Pink Chalet had given place to the honourable gentleman
He could play all parts well because he could believe in himself in them all
Then he spoke of danger not so as to slight her courage but to emphasize his own thoughtfulness
The world in which she had lived was crumbling and he alone could offer a refuge
She felt the steel gauntlet through the texture of the velvet glove
All the while she had been furiously thinking with her chin in her hand in the old way  She might refuse to go
He could compel her no doubt for there was no help to be got from the old servants
But it might be difficult to carry an unwilling woman over the first stages of the Underground Railway
There might be chances  Supposing he accepted her refusal and left her
Then indeed he would be gone for ever and our game would have closed with a fiasco
The great antagonist of England would go home rejoicing taking his sheaves with him
At this time she had no personal fear of him
So curious a thing is the human heart that her main preoccupation was with our mission not with her own fate
To fail utterly seemed too bitter
Supposing she went with him
They had still to get out of Italy and cross Switzerland
If she were with him she would be an emissary of the Allies in the enemys camp
She asked herself what could she do and told herself Nothing
She felt like a small bird in a very large trap and her chief sensation was that of her own powerlessness
But she had learned Blenkirons gospel and knew that Heaven sends amazing chances to the bold
And even as she made her decision she was aware of a dark shadow lurking at the back of her mind the shadow of the fear which she knew was awaiting her
For she was going into the unknown with a man whom she hated a man who claimed to be her lover
It was the bravest thing I have ever heard of and I have lived my life among brave men
I will come with you she said
But you mustnt speak to me please
I am tired and troubled and I want peace to think
As she rose weakness came over her and she swayed till his arm caught her
I wish I could let you rest for a little he said tenderly but time presses
The car runs smoothly and you can sleep there
He summoned one of the servants to whom he handed Mary
We leave in ten minutes he said and he went out to see to the car
Marys first act in the bedroom to which she was taken was to bathe her eyes and brush her hair
She felt dimly that she must keep her head clear
Her second was to scribble a note to Wake telling him what had happened and to give it to the servant with a tip
The gentleman will come in the morning she said
You must give it him at once for it concerns the fate of your country
The woman grinned and promised
It was not the first time she had done errands for pretty ladies
Ivery settled her in the great closed car with much solicitude and made her comfortable with rugs
Then he went back to the inn for a second and she saw a light move in the salleamanger
He returned and spoke to the driver in German taking his seat beside him
But first he handed Mary her note to Wake
I think you left this behind you he said
He had not opened it
Alone in the car Mary slept
She saw the figures of Ivery and the chauffeur in the front seat dark against the headlights and then they dislimned into dreams
She had undergone a greater strain than she knew and was sunk in the heavy sleep of weary nerves
When she woke it was daylight
They were still in Italy as her first glance told her so they could not have taken the Staub route
They seemed to be among the foothills for there was little snow but now and then up tributary valleys she had glimpses of the high peaks
She tried hard to think what it could mean and then remembered the Marjolana
Wake had laboured to instruct her in the topography of the Alps and she had grasped the fact of the two open passes
But the Marjolana meant a big circuit and they would not be in Switzerland till the evening
They would arrive in the dark and pass out of it in the dark and there would be no chance of succour
She felt very lonely and very weak
Throughout the morning her fear grew
The more hopeless her chance of defeating Ivery became the more insistently the dark shadow crept over her mind
She tried to steady herself by watching the show from the windows
The car swung through little villages past vineyards and pinewoods and the blue of lakes and over the gorges of mountain streams
There seemed to be no trouble about passports
The sentries at the controls waved a reassuring hand when they were shown some card which the chauffeur held between his teeth
In one place there was a longish halt and she could hear Ivery talking Italian with two officers of Bersaglieri to whom he gave cigars
They were freshfaced upstanding boys and for a second she had an idea of flinging open the door and appealing to them to save her
But that would have been futile for Ivery was clearly amply certificated
She wondered what part he was now playing
The Marjolana route had been chosen for a purpose
In one town ivery met and talked to a civilian official and more than once the car slowed down and someone appeared from the wayside to speak a word and vanish
She was assisting at the last gathering up of the threads of a great plan before the Wild Birds returned to their nest
Mostly these conferences seemed to be in Italian but once or twice she gathered from the movement of the lips that German was spoken and that this rough peasant or that blackhatted bourgeois was not of Italian blood
Early in the morning soon after she awoke Ivery had stopped the car and offered her a wellprovided luncheon basket
She could eat nothing and watched him breakfast off sandwiches beside the driver
In the afternoon he asked her permission to sit with her
The car drew up in a lonely place and a teabasket was produced by the chauffeur
Ivery made tea for she seemed too listless to move and she drank a cup with him
After that he remained beside her
In half an hour we shall be out of Italy he said
The car was running up a long valley to the curious hollow between snowy saddles which is the crest of the Marjolana
He showed her the place on a road map
As the altitude increased and the air grew colder he wrapped the rugs closer around her and apologized for the absence of a footwarmer
In a little he said we shall be in the land where your slightest wish will be law
She dozed again and so missed the frontier post
When she woke the car was slipping down the long curves of the Weiss valley before it narrows to the gorge through which it debouches on Grunewald
We are in Switzerland now she heard his voice say
It may have been fancy but it seemed to her that there was a new note in it
He spoke to her with the assurance of possession
They were outside the country of the Allies and in a land where his web was thickly spread
Where do we stop tonight
she asked timidly
I fear we cannot stop
Tonight also you must put up with the car
I have a little errand to do on the way which will delay us a few minutes and then we press on
Tomorrow my fairest one fatigue will be ended
There was no mistake now about the note of possession in his voice
Marys heart began to beat fast and wild
The trap had closed down on her and she saw the folly of her courage
It had delivered her bound and gagged into the hands of one whom she loathed more deeply every moment whose proximity was less welcome than a snakes
She had to bite hard on her lip to keep from screaming
The weather had changed and it was snowing hard the same storm that had greeted us on the Col of the Swallows
The pace was slower now and Ivery grew restless
He looked frequently at his watch and snatched the speakingtube to talk to the driver
Mary caught the word St Anton
Do we go by St Anton
she found voice to ask
Yes he said shortly
The word gave her the faintest glimmering of hope for she knew that Peter and I had lived at St Anton
She tried to look out of the blurred window but could see nothing except that the twilight was falling
She begged for the roadmap and saw that so far as she could make out they were still in the broad Grunewald valley and that to reach St Anton they had to cross the low pass from the Staubthal
The snow was still drifting thick and the car crawled
Then she felt the rise as they mounted to the pass
Here the going was bad very different from the dry frost in which I had covered the same road the night before
Moreover there seemed to be curious obstacles
Some careless woodcart had dropped logs on the highway and more than once both Ivery and the chauffeur had to get out to shift them
In one place there had been a small landslide which left little room to pass and Mary had to descend and cross on foot while the driver took the car over alone
Iverys temper seemed to be souring
To the girls relief he resumed the outside seat where he was engaged in constant argument with the chauffeur
At the head of the pass stands an inn the comfortable hostelry of Herr Kronig well known to all who clamber among the lesser peaks of the Staubthal
There in the middle of the way stood a man with a lantern
The road is blocked by a snowfall he cried
They are clearing it now
It will be ready in half an hours time
Ivery sprang from his seat and darted into the hotel
His business was to speed up the clearing party and Herr Kronig himself accompanied him to the scene of the catastrophe
Mary sat still for she had suddenly become possessed of an idea
She drove it from her as foolishness but it kept returning
Why had those treetrunks been spilt on the road
Why had an easy pass after a moderate snowfall been suddenly closed
A man came out of the innyard and spoke to the chauffeur
It seemed to be an offer of refreshment for the latter left his seat and disappeared inside
He was away for some time and returned shivering and grumbling at the weather with the collar of his greatcoat turned up around his ears
A lantern had been hung in the porch and as he passed Mary saw the man
She had been watching the back of his head idly during the long drive and had observed that it was of the round bullet type with no nape to the neck which is common in the Fatherland
Now she could not see his neck for the coat collar but she could have sworn that the head was a different shape
The man seemed to suffer acutely from the cold for he buttoned the collar round his chin and pulled his cap far over his brows
Ivery came back followed by a dragging line of men with spades and lanterns
He flung himself into the front seat and nodded to the driver to start
The man had his engine going already so as to lose no time
He bumped over the rough debris of the snowfall and then fairly let the car hum
Ivery was anxious for speed but he did not want his neck broken and he yelled out to take care
The driver nodded and slowed down but presently he had got up speed again
If Ivery was restless Mary was worse
She seemed suddenly to have come on the traces of her friends
In the St Anton valley the snow had stopped and she let down the window for air for she was choking with suspense
The car rushed past the station down the hill by Peters cottage through the village and along the lake shore to the Pink Chalet
Ivery halted it at the gate
See that you fill up with petrol he told the man
Bid Gustav get the Daimler and be ready to follow in half in hour
He spoke to Mary through the open window
I will keep you only a very little time
I think you had better wait in the car for it will be more comfortable than a dismantled house
A servant will bring you food and more rugs for the night journey
Then he vanished up the dark avenue
Marys first thought was to slip out and get back to the village and there to find someone who knew me or could take her where Peter lived
But the driver would prevent her for he had been left behind on guard
She looked anxiously at his back for he alone stood between her and liberty
That gentleman seemed to be intent on his own business
As soon as Iverys footsteps had grown faint he had backed the car into the entrance and turned it so that it faced towards St Anton
Then very slowly it began to move
At the same moment a whistle was blown shrilly three times
The door on the right had opened and someone who had been waiting in the shadows climbed painfully in
Mary saw that it was a little man and that he was a cripple
She reached a hand to help him and he fell on to the cushions beside her
The car was gathering speed
Before she realized what was happening the newcomer had taken her hand and was patting it
About two minutes later I was entering the gate of the Pink Chalet
CHAPTER NINETEEN The Cage of the Wild Birds Why Mr Ivery come right in said the voice at the table
There was a screen before me stretching from the fireplace to keep off the draught from the door by which I had entered
It stood higher than my head but there were cracks in it through which I could watch the room
I found a little table on which I could lean my back for I was dropping with fatigue
Blenkiron sat at the writingtable and in front of him were little rows of Patience cards
Wood ashes still smouldered in the stove and a lamp stood at his right elbow which lit up the two figures
The bookshelves and the cabinets were in twilight
Ive been hoping to see you for quite a time
Blenkiron was busy arranging the little heaps of cards and his face was wreathed in hospitable smiles
I remember wondering why he should play the host to the true master of the house
Ivery stood erect before him
He was rather a splendid figure now that he had sloughed all disguises and was on the threshold of his triumph
Even through the fog in which my brain worked it was forced upon me that here was a man born to play a big part
He had a jowl like a Roman king on a coin and scornful eyes that were used to mastery
He was younger than me confound him and now he looked it
He kept his eyes on the speaker while a smile played round his mouth a very ugly smile
So he said
We have caught the old crow too
I had scarcely hoped for such good fortune and to speak the truth I had not concerned myself much about you
But now we shall add you to the bag
And what a bag of vermin to lay out on the lawn
He flung back his head and laughed
Mr Ivery  Blenkiron began but was cut short
Drop that name
All that is past thank God
I am the Graf von Schwabing an officer of the Imperial Guard
I am not the least of the weapons that Germany has used to break her enemies
You dont say drawled Blenkiron still fiddling with his Patience cards
The mans moment had come and he was minded not to miss a jot of his triumph
His figure seemed to expand his eye kindled his voice rang with pride
It was melodrama of the best kind and he fairly rolled it round his tongue
I dont think I grudged it him for I was fingering something in my pocket
He had won all right but he wouldnt enjoy his victory long for soon I would shoot him
I had my eye on the very spot above his right ear where I meant to put my bullet  For I was very clear that to kill him was the only way to protect Mary
I feared the whole seventy millions of Germany less than this man
That was the single idea that remained firm against the immense fatigue that pressed down on me
I have little time to waste on you said he who had been called Ivery
But I will spare a moment to tell you a few truths
Your childish game never had a chance
I played with you in England and I have played with you ever since
You have never made a move but I have quietly countered it
Why man you gave me your confidence
The American Mr Donne  What about Clarence
asked Blenkiron
His face seemed a study in pure bewilderment
I was that interesting journalist
Now to think of that
said Blenkiron in a sad gentle voice
I thought I was safe with Clarence
Why he brought me a letter from old Joe Hooper and he knew all the boys down Emporia way
Ivery laughed
You have never done me justice I fear but I think you will do it now
Your gang is helpless in my hands
General Hannay  And I wish I could give you a notion of the scorn with which he pronounced the word General
Yes  Dick
said Blenkiron intently
He has been my prisoner for twentyfour hours
And the pretty Miss Mary too
You are all going with me in a little to my own country
You will not guess how
We call it the Underground Railway and you will have the privilege of studying its working

I had not troubled much about you for I had no special dislike of you
You are only a blundering fool what you call in your country easy fruit
I thank you Graf Blenkiron said solemnly
But since you are here you will join the others  One last word
To beat inepts such as you is nothing
There is a far greater thing
My country has conquered
You and your friends will be dragged at the chariot wheels of a triumph such as Rome never saw
Does that penetrate your thick skull
Germany has won and in two days the whole round earth will be stricken dumb by her greatness
As I watched Blenkiron a grey shadow of hopelessness seemed to settle on his face
His big body drooped in his chair his eyes fell and his left hand shuffled limply among his Patience cards
I could not get my mind to work but I puzzled miserably over his amazing blunders
He had walked blindly into the pit his enemies had dug for him
Peter must have failed to get my message to him and he knew nothing of last nights work or my mad journey to Italy
We had all bungled the whole wretched bunch of us Peter and Blenkiron and myself 
I had a feeling at the back of my head that there was something in it all that I couldnt understand that the catastrophe could not be quite as simple as it seemed
But I had no power to think with the insolent figure of Ivery dominating the room 
Thank God I had a bullet waiting for him
That was the one fixed point in the chaos of my mind
For the first time in my life I was resolute on killing one particular man and the purpose gave me a horrid comfort
Suddenly Iverys voice rang out sharp
Take your hand out of your pocket
You fool you are covered from three points in the walls
A movement and my men will make a sieve of you
Others before you have sat in that chair and I am used to take precautions
Quick
Both hands on the table
There was no mistake about Blenkirons defeat
He was done and out and I was left with the only card
He leaned wearily on his arms with the palms of his hands spread out
I reckon youve gotten a strong hand Graf he said and his voice was flat with despair
I hold a royal flush was the answer
And then suddenly came a change
Blenkiron raised his head and his sleepy ruminating eyes looked straight at Ivery
I call you he said
I didnt believe my ears
Nor did Ivery
The hour for bluff is past he said
Nevertheless I call you
At that moment I felt someone squeeze through the door behind me and take his place at my side
The light was so dim that I saw only a short square figure but a familiar voice whispered in my ear
Its me  Andra Amos
Man this is a great ploy
Im here to see the end ot
No prisoner waiting on the finding of the jury no commander expecting news of a great battle ever hung in more desperate suspense than I did during the next seconds
I had forgotten my fatigue my back no longer needed support
I kept my eyes glued to the crack in the screen and my ears drank in greedily every syllable
Blenkiron was now sitting bolt upright with his chin in his hands
There was no shadow of melancholy in his lean face
I say I call you Herr Graf von Schwabing
Im going to put you wise about some little things
You dont carry arms so I neednt warn you against monkeying with a gun
Youre right in saying that there are three places in these walls from which you can shoot
Well for your information I may tell you that theres guns in all three but theyre covering you at this moment
So youd better be good
Ivery sprang to attention like a ramrod
Karl he cried
Gustav
As if by magic figures stood on either side of him like warders by a criminal
They were not the sleek German footmen whom I had seen at the Chalet
One I did not recognize
The other was my servant Geordie Hamilton
He gave them one glance looked round like a hunted animal and then steadied himself
The man had his own kind of courage
Ive gotten something to say to you Blenkiron drawled
Its been a tough fight but I reckon the hot end of the poker is with you
I compliment you on Clarence Donne
You fooled me fine over that business and it was only by the mercy of God you didnt win out
You see there was just the one of us who was liable to recognize you whatever way you twisted your face and that was Dick Hannay
I give you good marks for Clarence  For the rest I had you beaten flat
He looked steadily at him
You dont believe it
Well Ill give you proof
Ive been watching your Underground Railway for quite a time
Ive had my men on the job and I reckon most of the lines are now closed for repairs
All but the trunk line into France
That Im keeping open for soon theres going to be some traffic on it
At that I saw Iverys eyelids quiver
For all his selfcommand he was breaking
I admit we cut it mighty fine along of your fooling me about Clarence
But you struck a bad snag in General Hannay Graf
Your hearttoheart talk with him was poor business
You reckoned you had him safe but that was too big a risk to take with a man like Dick unless you saw him cold before you left him 
He got away from this place and early this morning I knew all he knew
After that it was easy
I got the telegram you had sent this morning in the name of Clarence Donne and it made me laugh
Before midday I had this whole outfit under my hand
Your servants have gone by the Underground Railway  to France
Ehrlich  well Im sorry about Ehrlich
I knew now the name of the Portuguese Jew
He wasnt a bad sort of man Blenkiron said regretfully and he was plumb honest
I couldnt get him to listen to reason and he would play with firearms
So I had to shoot
Dead
asked Ivery sharply
Yees
I dont miss and it was him or me
Hes under the ice now  where you wanted to send Dick Hannay
He wasnt your kind Graf and I guess he has some chance of getting into Heaven
If I werent a hardshell Presbyterian Id say a prayer for his soul
I looked only at Ivery
His face had gone very pale and his eyes were wandering
I am certain his brain was working at lightning speed but he was a rat in a steel trap and the springs held him
If ever I saw a man going through hell it was now
His pasteboard castle had crumbled about his ears and he was giddy with the fall of it
The man was made of pride and every proud nerve of him was caught on the raw
So much for ordinary business said Blenkiron
Theres the matter of a certain lady
You havent behaved overnice about her Graf but Im not going to blame you
You maybe heard a whistle blow when you were coming in here
No
Why it sounded like Gabriels trump
Peter must have put some lung power into it
Well that was the signal that Miss Mary was safe in your car  but in our charge
Dyou comprehend
He did
The ghost of a flush appeared in his cheeks
You ask about General Hannay
Im not just exactly sure where Dick is at the moment but I opine hes in Italy
I kicked aside the screen thereby causing Amos almost to fall on his face
Im back I said and pulled up an armchair and dropped into it
I think the sight of me was the last straw for Ivery
I was a wild enough figure grey with weariness soaked dirty with the clothes of the porter Joseph Zimmer in rags from the sharp rocks of the Schwarzsteinthor
As his eyes caught mine they wavered and I saw terror in them
He knew he was in the presence of a mortal enemy
Why Dick said Blenkiron with a beaming face this is mighty opportune
How in creation did you get here
I walked I said
I did not want to have to speak for I was too tired
I wanted to watch Iverys face
Blenkiron gathered up his Patience cards slipped them into a little leather case and put it in his pocket
Ive one thing more to tell you
The Wild Birds have been summoned home but they wont ever make it
Weve gathered them in  Pavia and Hofgaard and Conradi
Ehrlich is dead
And you are going to join the rest in our cage
As I looked at my friend his figure seemed to gain in presence
He sat square in his chair with a face like a hanging judge and his eyes sleepy no more held Ivery as in a vice
He had dropped too his drawl and the idioms of his ordinary speech and his voice came out hard and massive like the clash of granite blocks
Youre at the bar now Graf von Schwabing
For years youve done your best against the decencies of life
You have deserved well of your country I dont doubt it
But what has your country deserved of the world
One day soon Germany has to do some heavy paying and you are the first instalment
I appeal to the Swiss law
I stand on Swiss soil and I demand that I be surrendered to the Swiss authorities
Ivery spoke with dry lips and the sweat was on his brow
Oh no no said Blenkiron soothingly
The Swiss are a nice people and I would hate to add to the worries of a poor little neutral state  All along both sides have been outside the law in this game and thats going to continue
Weve abode by the rules and so must you  For years youve murdered and kidnapped and seduced the weak and ignorant but were not going to judge your morals
We leave that to the Almighty when you get across Jordan
Were going to wash our hands of you as soon as we can
Youll travel to France by the Underground Railway and there be handed over to the French Government
From what I know theyve enough against you to shoot you every hour of the day for a twelvemonth
I think he had expected to be condemned by us there and then and sent to join Ehrlich beneath the ice
Anyhow there came a flicker of hope into his eyes
I daresay he saw some way to dodge the French authorities if he once got a chance to use his miraculous wits
Anyhow he bowed with something very like selfpossession and asked permission to smoke
As I have said the man had his own courage
Blenkiron I cried were going to do nothing of the kind
He inclined his head gravely towards me
Whats your notion Dick
Weve got to make the punishment fit the crime I said
I was so tired that I had to form my sentences laboriously as if I were speaking a halfunderstood foreign tongue
Meaning
I mean that if you hand him over to the French hell either twist out of their hands somehow or get decently shot which is far too good for him
This man and his kind have sent millions of honest folk to their graves
He has sat spinning his web like a great spider and for every thread there has been an ocean of blood spilled
Its his sort that made the war not the brave stupid fighting Boche
Its his sort thats responsible for all the clotted beastliness  And hes never been in sight of a shell
Im for putting him in the front line
No I dont mean any Uriah the Hittite business
I want him to have a sporting chance just what other men have
But by God hes going to learn what is the upshot of the strings hes been pulling so merrily 
He told me in two days time Germany would smash our armies to hell
He boasted that he would be mostly responsible for it
Well let him be there to see the smashing
I reckon thats just said Blenkiron
Iverys eyes were on me now fascinated and terrified like those of a bird before a rattlesnake
I saw again the shapeless features of the man in the Tube station the residuum of shrinking mortality behind his disguises
He seemed to be slipping something from his pocket towards his mouth but Geordie Hamilton caught his wrist
Wad ye offer
said the scandalized voice of my servant
Sirr the prisoner would appear to be trying to puishon hisself
Wull I search him
After that he stood with each arm in the grip of a warder
Mr Ivery I said last night when I was in your power you indulged your vanity by gloating over me
I expected it for your class does not breed gentlemen
We treat our prisoners differently but it is fair that you should know your fate
You are going into France and I will see that you are taken to the British front
There with my old division you will learn something of the meaning of war
Understand that by no conceivable chance can you escape
Men will be detailed to watch you day and night and to see that you undergo the full rigour of the battlefield
You will have the same experience as other people no more no less
I believe in a righteous God and I know that sooner or later you will find death  death at the hands of your own people  an honourable death which is far beyond your deserts
But before it comes you will have understood the hell to which you have condemned honest men
In moments of great fatigue as in moments of great crisis the mind takes charge and may run on a track independent of the will
It was not myself that spoke but an impersonal voice which I did not know a voice in whose tones rang a strange authority
Ivery recognized the icy finality of it and his body seemed to wilt and droop
Only the hold of the warders kept him from falling
I too was about at the end of my endurance
I felt dimly that the room had emptied except for Blenkiron and Amos and that the former was trying to make me drink brandy from the cup of a flask
I struggled to my feet with the intention of going to Mary but my legs would not carry me 
I heard as in a dream Amos giving thanks to an Omnipotence in whom he officially disbelieved
Whats that the auld man in the Bible said
Now let thou thy servant depart in peace
Thats the way Im feelin mysel
And then slumber came on me like an armed man and in the chair by the dying woodash I slept off the ache of my limbs the tension of my nerves and the confusion of my brain
CHAPTER TWENTY The Storm Breaks in the West The following evening  it was the 20th day of March  I started for France after the dark fell
I drove Iverys big closed car and within sat its owner bound and gagged as others had sat before him on the same errand
Geordie Hamilton and Amos were his companions
From what Blenkiron had himself discovered and from the papers seized in the Pink Chalet I had full details of the road and its mysterious stages
It was like the journey of a mad dream
In a back street of a little town I would exchange passwords with a nameless figure and be given instructions
At a wayside inn at an appointed hour a voice speaking a thick German would advise that this bridge or that railway crossing had been cleared
At a hamlet among pine woods an unknown man would clamber up beside me and take me past a sentrypost
Smooth as clockwork was the machine till in the dawn of a spring morning I found myself dropping into a broad valley through little orchards just beginning to blossom and I knew that I was in France
After that Blenkirons own arrangements began and soon I was drinking coffee with a young lieutenant of Chasseurs and had taken the gag from Iverys mouth
The bluecoats looked curiously at the man in the green ulster whose face was the colour of clay and who lit cigarette from cigarette with a shaky hand
The lieutenant rang up a General of Division who knew all about us
At his headquarters I explained my purpose and he telegraphed to an Army Headquarters for a permission which was granted
It was not for nothing that in January I had seen certain great personages in Paris and that Blenkiron had wired ahead of me to prepare the way
Here I handed over Ivery and his guard for I wanted them to proceed to Amiens under French supervision well knowing that the men of that great army are not used to let slip what they once hold
It was a morning of clear spring sunlight when we breakfasted in that little redroofed town among vineyards with a shining river looping at our feet
The General of Division was an Algerian veteran with a brush of grizzled hair whose eye kept wandering to a map on the wall where pins and stretched thread made a spiders web
Any news from the north
I asked
Not yet he said
But the attack comes soon
It will be against our army in Champagne
With a lean finger he pointed out the enemy dispositions
Why not against the British
I asked
With a knife and fork I made a right angle and put a salt dish in the centre
That is the German concentration
They can so mass that we do not know which side of the angle they will strike till the blow falls
It is true he replied
But consider
For the enemy to attack towards the Somme would be to fight over many miles of an old battleground where all is still desert and every yard of which you British know
In Champagne at a bound he might enter unbroken country
It is a long and difficult road to Amiens but not so long to Chilons
Such is the view of Petain
Does it convince you
The reasoning is good
Nevertheless he will strike at Amiens and I think he will begin today
He laughed and shrugged his shoulders
Nous verrons
You are obstinate my general like all your excellent countrymen
But as I left his headquarters an aidedecamp handed him a message on a pink slip
He read it and turned to me with a grave face
You have a flair my friend
I am glad we did not wager
This morning at dawn there is great fighting around St Quentin
Be comforted for they will not pass
Your Marechal will hold them
That was the first news I had of the battle
At Dijon according to plan I met the others
I only just caught the Paris train and Blenkirons great wrists lugged me into the carriage when it was well in motion
There sat Peter a docile figure in a carefully patched old RFC
uniform
Wake was reading a pile of French papers and in a corner Mary with her feet up on the seat was sound asleep
We did not talk much for the life of the past days had been so hectic that we had no wish to recall it
Blenkirons face wore an air of satisfaction and as he looked out at the sunny spring landscape he hummed his only tune
Even Wake had lost his restlessness
He had on a pair of big tortoiseshell reading glasses and when he looked up from his newspaper and caught my eye he smiled
Mary slept like a child delicately flushed her breath scarcely stirring the collar of the greatcoat which was folded across her throat
I remember looking with a kind of awe at the curve of her young face and the long lashes that lay so softly on her cheek and wondering how I had borne the anxiety of the last months
Wake raised his head from his reading glanced at Mary and then at me and his eyes were kind almost affectionate
He seemed to have won peace of mind among the hills
Only Peter was out of the picture
He was a strange disconsolate figure as he shifted about to ease his leg or gazed incuriously from the window
He had shaved his beard again but it did not make him younger for his face was too lined and his eyes too old to change
When I spoke to him he looked towards Mary and held up a warning finger
I go back to England he whispered
Your little mysie is going to take care of me till I am settled
We spoke of it yesterday at my cottage
I will find a lodging and be patient till the war is over
And you Dick
Oh I rejoin my division
Thank God this job is over
I have an easy trund now and can turn my attention to straightforward soldiering
I dont mind telling you that Ill be glad to think that you and Mary and Blenkiron are safe at home
What about you Wake
I go back to my Labour battalion he said cheerfully
Like you I have an easier mind
I shook my head
Well see about that
I dont like such sinful waste
Weve had a bit of campaigning together and I know your quality
The battalions quite good enough for me and he relapsed into a dayold Temps
Mary had suddenly woke and was sitting upright with her fists in her eyes like a small child
Her hand flew to her hair and her eyes ran over us as if to see that we were all there
As she counted the four of us she seemed relieved
I reckon you feel refreshed Miss Mary said Blenkiron
Its good to think that now we can sleep in peace all of us
Pretty soon youll be in England and spring will be beginning and please God itll be the start of a better world
Our works over anyhow
I wonder said the girl gravely
I dont think theres any discharge in this war
Dick have you news of the battle
This was the day
Its begun I said and told them the little I had learned from the French General
Ive made a reputation as a prophet for he thought the attack was coming in Champagne
Its St Quentin right enough but I dont know what has happened
Well hear in Paris
Mary had woke with a startled air as if she remembered her old instinct that our work would not be finished without a sacrifice and that sacrifice the best of us
The notion kept recurring to me with an uneasy insistence
But soon she appeared to forget her anxiety
That afternoon as we journeyed through the pleasant land of France she was in holiday mood and she forced all our spirits up to her level
It was calm bright weather the long curves of ploughland were beginning to quicken into green the catkins made a blue mist on the willows by the watercourses and in the orchards by the redroofed hamlets the blossom was breaking
In such a scene it was hard to keep the mind sober and grey and the pall of war slid from us
Mary cosseted and fussed over Peter like an elder sister over a delicate little boy
She made him stretch his bad leg full length on the seat and when she made tea for the party of us it was a protesting Peter who had the last sugar biscuit
Indeed we were almost a merry company for Blenkiron told stories of old hunting and engineering days in the West and Peter and I were driven to cap them and Mary asked provocative questions and Wake listened with amused interest
It was well that we had the carriage to ourselves for no queerer rigs were ever assembled
Mary as always was neat and workmanlike in her dress Blenkiron was magnificent in a suit of russet tweed with a paleblue shirt and collar and well polished brown shoes but Peter and Wake were in uniforms which had seen far better days and I wore still the boots and the shapeless and ragged clothes of Joseph Zimmer the porter from Arosa
We appeared to forget the war but we didnt for it was in the background of all our minds
Somewhere in the north there was raging a desperate fight and its issue was the true test of our success or failure
Mary showed it by bidding me ask for news at every stoppingplace
I asked gendarmes and Permissionnaires but I learned nothing
Nobody had ever heard of the battle
The upshot was that for the last hour we all fell silent and when we reached Paris about seven oclock my first errand was to the bookstall
I bought a batch of evening papers which we tried to read in the taxis that carried us to our hotel
Sure enough there was the announcement in big headlines
The enemy had attacked in great strength from south of Arras to the Oise but everywhere he had been repulsed and held in our battlezone
The leading articles were confident the notes by the various military critics were almost braggart
At last the German had been driven to an offensive and the Allies would have the opportunity they had longed for of proving their superior fighting strength
It was said one and all the opening of the last phase of the war
I confess that as I read my heart sank
If the civilians were so overconfident might not the generals have fallen into the same trap
Blenkiron alone was unperturbed
Mary said nothing but she sat with her chin in her hands which with her was a sure sign of deep preoccupation
Next morning the papers could tell us little more
The main attack had been on both sides of St Quentin and though the British had given ground it was only the outposts line that had gone
The mist had favoured the enemy and his bombardment had been terrific especially the gas shells
Every journal added the old old comment  that he had paid heavily for his temerity with losses far exceeding those of the defence
Wake appeared at breakfast in his privates uniform
He wanted to get his railway warrant and be off at once but when I heard that Amiens was his destination I ordered him to stay and travel with me in the afternoon
I was in uniform myself now and had taken charge of the outfit
I arranged that Blenkiron Mary and Peter should go on to Boulogne and sleep the night there while Wake and I would be dropped at Amiens to await instructions
I spent a busy morning
Once again I visited with Blenkiron the little cabinet in the Boulevard St Germain and told in every detail our work of the past two months
Once again I sat in the low building beside the Invalides and talked to staff officers
But some of the men I had seen on the first visit were not there
The chiefs of the French Army had gone north
We arranged for the handling of the Wild Birds now safely in France and sanction was given to the course I had proposed to adopt with Ivery
He and his guard were on their way to Amiens and I would meet them there on the morrow
The great men were very complimentary to us so complimentary that my knowledge of grammatical French ebbed away and I could only stutter in reply
That telegram sent by Blenkiron on the night of the 18th from the information given me in the Pink Chalet had done wonders in clearing up the situation
But when I asked them about the battle they could tell me little
It was a very serious attack in tremendous force but the British line was strong and the reserves were believed to be sufficient
Petain and Foch had gone north to consult with Haig
The situation in Champagne was still obscure but some French reserves were already moving thence to the Somme sector
One thing they did show me the British dispositions
As I looked at the plan I saw that my old division was in the thick of the fighting
Where do you go now
I was asked
To Amiens and then please God to the battle front I said
Good fortune to you
You do not give body or mind much rest my general
After that I went to the Mission Anglaise but they had nothing beyond Haigs communique and a telephone message from GHQ
that the critical sector was likely to be that between St Quentin and the Oise
The northern pillar of our defence south of Arras which they had been nervous about had stood like a rock
That pleased me for my old battalion of the Lennox Highlanders was there
Crossing the Place de la Concorde we fell in with a British staff officer of my acquaintance who was just starting to motor back to GHQ
from Paris leave
He had a longer face than the people at the Invalides
I dont like it I tell you he said
Its this mist that worries me
I went down the whole line from Arras to the Oise ten days ago
It was beautifully sited the cleverest thing you ever saw
The outpost line was mostly a chain of blobs  redoubts you know with machineguns  so arranged as to bring flanking fire to bear on the advancing enemy
But mist would play the devil with that scheme for the enemy would be past the place for flanking fire before we knew it Oh I know we had good warning and had the battlezone manned in time but the outpost line was meant to hold out long enough to get everything behind in applepie order and I cant see but how big chunks of it must have gone in the first rush

Mind you weve banked everything on that battle zone
Its damned good but if its gone He flung up his hands
Have we good reserves
I asked
He shrugged his shoulders
Have we positions prepared behind the battlezone
i didnt notice any he said dryly and was off before I could get more out of him
You look rattled Dick said Blenkiron as we walked to the hotel
I seem to have got the needle
Its silly but I feel worse about this show than Ive ever felt since the war started
Look at this city here
The papers take it easily and the people are walking about as if nothing was happening
Even the soldiers arent worried
You may call me a fool to take it so hard but Ive a sense in my bones that were in for the bloodiest and darkest fight of our lives and that soon Paris will be hearing the Boche guns as she did in 1914
Youre a cheerful old Jeremiah
Well Im glad Miss Marys going to be in England soon
Seems to me shes right and that this game of ours isnt quite played out yet
Im envying you some for theres a place waiting for you in the fighting line
Youve got to get home and keep peoples heads straight there
Thats the weak link in our chain and theres a mighty lot of work before you
Maybe he said abstractedly with his eye on the top of the Vendome column
The train that afternoon was packed with officers recalled from leave and it took all the combined purchase of Blenkiron and myself to get a carriage reserved for our little party
At the last moment I opened the door to admit a warm and agitated captain of the RFC
in whom I recognized my friend and benefactor Archie Roylance
Just when I was gettin nice and clean and comfy a wire comes tellin me to bundle back all along of a new battle
Its a cruel war Sir
The afflicted young man mopped his forehead grinned cheerfully at Blenkiron glanced critically at Peter then caught sight of Mary and grew at once acutely conscious of his appearance
He smoothed his hair adjusted his tie and became desperately sedate
I introduced him to Peter and he promptly forgot Marys existence
If Peter had had any vanity in him it would have been flattered by the frank interest and admiration in the boys eyes
Im tremendously glad to see you safe back sir
Ive always hoped I might have a chance of meeting you
We want you badly now on the front
Lensch is gettin a bit uppish
Then his eye fell on Peters withered leg and he saw that he had blundered
He blushed scarlet and looked his apologies
But they werent needed for it cheered Peter to meet someone who talked of the possibility of his fighting again
Soon the two were deep in technicalities the appalling technicalities of the airman
It was no good listening to their talk for you could make nothing of it but it was bracing up Peter like wine
Archie gave him a minute description of Lenschs latest doings and his new methods
He too had heard the rumour that Peter had mentioned to me at St Anton of a new Boche plane with mighty engines and stumpy wings cunningly cambered which was a devil to climb but no specimens had yet appeared over the line
They talked of Bali and Rhys Davids and Bishop and McCudden and all the heroes who had won their spurs since the Somme and of the new British makes most of which Peter had never seen and had to have explained to him
Outside a haze had drawn over the meadows with the twilight
I pointed it out to Blenkiron
Theres the fog thats doing us
This March weather is just like October mist morning and evening
I wish to Heaven we could have some good old drenching spring rain
Archie was discoursing of the SharkGladas machine
Ive always stuck to it for its a marvel in its way but it has my heart fairly broke
The General here knows its little tricks
Dont you sir
Whenever things get really excitin the engines apt to quit work and take a rest
The whole make should be publicly burned I said with gloomy recollections
I wouldnt go so far sir
The old Gladas has surprisin merits
On her day theres nothing like her for pace and climbingpower and she steers as sweet as a racin cutter
The trouble about her is shes too complicated
Shes like some breeds of car  you want to be a mechanical genius to understand her 
If theyd only get her a little simpler and safer there wouldnt be her match in the field
Im about the only man that has patience with her and knows her merits but shes often been nearly the death of me
All the same if I were in for a big fight against some fellow like Lensch where it was neck or nothing Im hanged if I wouldnt pick the Gladas
Archie laughed apologetically
The subject is banned for me in our mess
Im the old things only champion and shes like a mare I used to hunt that loved me so much she was always tryin to chew the arm off me
But I wish I could get her a fair trial from one of the big pilots
Im only in the second class myself after all
We were running north of St just when above the rattle of the train rose a curious dull sound
It came from the east and was like the low growl of a veld thunderstorm or a steady roll of muffled drums
Hark to the guns
cried Archie
My aunt theres a tidy bombardment goin on somewhere
I had been listening on and off to guns for three years
I had been present at the big preparations before Loos and the Somme and Arras and I had come to accept the racket of artillery as something natural and inevitable like rain or sunshine
But this sound chilled me with its eeriness I dont know why
Perhaps it was its unexpectedness for I was sure that the guns had not been heard in this area since before the Marne
The noise must be travelling down the Oise valley and I judged there was big fighting somewhere about Chauny or La Fere
That meant that the enemy was pressing hard on a huge front for here was clearly a great effort on his extreme left wing
Unless it was our counterattack
But somehow I didnt think so
I let down the window and stuck my head into the night
The fog had crept to the edge of the track a gossamer mist through which houses and trees and cattle could be seen dim in the moonlight
The noise continued  not a mutter but a steady rumbling flow as solid as the blare of a trumpet
Presently as we drew nearer Amiens we left it behind us for in all the Somme valley there is some curious configuration which blankets sound
The countryfolk call it the Silent Land and during the first phase of the Somme battle a man in Amiens could not hear the guns twenty miles off at Albert
As I sat down again I found that the company had fallen silent even the garrulous Archie
Marys eyes met mine and in the indifferent light of the French railwaycarriage I could see excitement in them  I knew it was excitement not fear
She had never heard the noise of a great barrage before
Blenkiron was restless and Peter was sunk in his own thoughts
I was growing very depressed for in a little I would have to part from my best friends and the girl I loved
But with the depression was mixed an odd expectation which was almost pleasant
The guns had brought back my profession to me I was moving towards their thunder and God only knew the end of it
The happy dream I had dreamed of the Cotswolds and a home with Mary beside me seemed suddenly to have fallen away to an infinite distance
I felt once again that I was on the razoredge of life
The last part of the journey I was casting back to rake up my knowledge of the countryside
I saw again the stricken belt from Serre to Combles where we had fought in the summer Of 17
I had not been present in the advance of the following spring but I had been at Cambrai and I knew all the down country from Lagnicourt to St Quentin
I shut my eyes and tried to picture it and to see the roads running up to the line and wondered just at what points the big pressure had come
They had told me in Paris that the British were as far south as the Oise so the bombardment we had heard must be directed to our address
With Passchendaele and Cambrai in my mind and some notion of the difficulties we had always had in getting drafts I was puzzled to think where we could have found the troops to man the new front
We must be unholily thin on that long line
And against that awesome bombardment
And the masses and the new tactics that Ivery had bragged of
When we ran into the dingy cavern which is Amiens station I seemed to note a new excitement
I felt it in the air rather than deduced it from any special incident except that the platform was very crowded with civilians most of them with an extra amount of baggage
I wondered if the place had been bombed the night before
We wont say goodbye yet I told the others
The train doesnt leave for half an hour
Im off to try and get news
Accompanied by Archie I hunted out an RTO
of my acquaintance
To my questions he responded cheerfully
Oh were doing famously sir
I heard this afternoon from a man in Operations that GHQ
was perfectly satisfied
Weve killed a lot of Huns and only lost a few kilometres of ground  Youre going to your division
Well its up Peronne way or was last night
Cheyne and Dunthorpe came back from leave and tried to steal a car to get up to it  Oh Im having the deuce of a time
These blighted civilians have got the wind up and a lot are trying to clear out
The idiots say the Huns will be in Amiens in a week
Whats the phrase
Pourvu que les civils tiennent
Fraid I must push on Sir
I sent Archie back with these scraps of news and was about to make a rush for the house of one of the Press officers who would I thought be in the way of knowing things when at the station entrance I ran across Laidlaw
He had been BGGS
in the corps to which my old brigade belonged and was now on the staff of some army
He was striding towards a car when I grabbed his arm and he turned on me a very sick face
Good Lord Hannay
Where did you spring from
The news you say
He sank his voice and drew me into a quiet corner
The news is hellish
They told me we were holding I observed
Holding be damned
The Boche is clean through on a broad front
He broke us today at Maissemy and Essigny
Yes the battle zone
Hes flinging in division after division like the blows of a hammer
What else could you expect
And he clutched my arm fiercely
How in Gods name could eleven divisions hold a front of forty miles
And against four to one in numbers
It isnt war its naked lunacy
I knew the worst now and it didnt shock me for I had known it was coming
Laidlaws nerves were pretty bad for his face was pale and his eyes bright like a man with a fever
Reserves
and he laughed bitterly
We have three infantry divisions and two cavalry
Theyre into the mill long ago
The French are coming up on our right but theyve the devil of a way to go
Thats what Im down here about
And were getting help from Horne and Plumer
But all that takes days and meantime were walking back like we did at Mons
And at this time of day too  Oh yes the whole lines retreating
Parts of it were pretty comfortable but they had to get back or be put in the bag
I wish to Heaven I knew where our right divisions have got to
For all I know theyre at Compiegne by now
The Boche was over the canal this morning and by this time most likely hes across the Somme
At that I exclaimed
Dyou mean to tell me were going to lose Peronne
Peronne
he cried
Well be lucky not to lose Amiens
 And on the top of it all Ive got some kind of blasted fever
Ill be raving in an hour
He was rushing off but I held him
What about my old lot
I asked
Oh damned good but theyre shot all to bits
Every division did well
Its a marvel they werent all scuppered and itll be a flaming miracle if they find a line they can stand on
Westwaters got a leg smashed
He was brought down this evening and youll find him in the hospital
Frasers killed and Lefroys a prisoner  at least that was my last news
I dont know whos got the brigades but Mastertons carrying on with the division  Youd better get up the line as fast as you can and take over from him
See the Army Commander
Hell be in Amiens tomorrow morning for a powwow
Laidlaw lay wearily back in his car and disappeared into the night while I hurried to the train
The others had descended to the platform and were grouped round Archie who was discoursing optimistic nonsense
I got them into the carriage and shut the door
Its pretty bad I said
The fronts pierced in several places and were back to the Upper Somme
Im afraid it isnt going to stop there
Im off up the line as soon as I can get my orders
Wake youll come with me for every man will be wanted
Blenkiron youll see Mary and Peter safe to England
Were just in time for tomorrow it mightnt be easy to get out of Amiens
I can see yet the anxious faces in that illlit compartment
We said goodbye after the British style without much todo
I remember that old Peter gripped my hand as if he would never release it and that Marys face had grown very pale
If I delayed another second I should have howled for Marys lips were trembling and Peter had eyes like a wounded stag
God bless you I said hoarsely and as I went off I heard Peters voice a little cracked saying God bless you my old friend
I spent some weary hours looking for Westwater
He was not in the big clearing station but I ran him to earth at last in the new hospital which had just been got going in the Ursuline convent
He was the most sterling little man in ordinary life rather dry and dogmatic with a trick of taking you up sharply which didnt make him popular
Now he was lying very stiff and quiet in the hospital bed and his blue eyes were solemn and pathetic like a sick dogs
Theres nothing much wrong with me he said in reply to my question
A shell dropped beside me and damaged my foot
They say theyll have to cut it off 
Ive an easier mind now youre here Hannay
Of course youll take over from Masterton
Hes a good man but not quite up to his job
Poor Fraser  youve heard about Fraser
He was done in at the very start
Yes a shell
And Lefroy
If hes alive and not too badly smashed the Hun has got a troublesome prisoner
He was too sick to talk but he wouldnt let me go
The division was all right
Dont you believe anyone who says we didnt fight like heroes
Our outpost line held up the Hun for six hours and only about a dozen men came back
We could have stuck it out in the battlezone if both flanks hadnt been turned
They got through Crabbes left and came down the Verey ravine and a big wave rushed Shropshire Wood  We fought it out yard by yard and didnt budge till we saw the Plessis dump blazing in our rear
Then it was about time to go  We havent many battalion commanders left
Watson Endicot Crawshay  He stammered out a list of gallant fellows who had gone
Get back double quick Hannay
They want you
Im not happy about Masterton
Hes too young for the job
And then a nurse drove me out and I left him speaking in the strange forced voice of great weakness
At the foot of the staircase stood Mary
I saw you go in she said so I waited for you
Oh my dear I cried you should have been in Boulogne by now
What madness brought you here
They know me here and theyve taken me on
You couldnt expect me to stay behind
You said yourself everybody was wanted and Im in a Service like you
Please dont be angry Dick
I wasnt angry I wasnt even extra anxious
The whole thing seemed to have been planned by fate since the creation of the world
The game we had been engaged in wasnt finished and it was right that we should play it out together
With that feeling came a conviction too of ultimate victory
Somehow or sometime we should get to the end of our pilgrimage
But I remembered Marys forebodings about the sacrifice required
The best of us
That ruled me out but what about her
I caught her to my arms
Goodbye my very dearest
Dont worry about me for mines a soft job and I can look after my skin
But oh
take care of yourself for you are all the world to me
She kissed me gravely like a wise child
I am not afraid for you she said
You are going to stand in the breach and I know  I know you will win
Remember that there is someone here whose heart is so full of pride of her man that it hasnt room for fear
As I went out of the convent door I felt that once again I had been given my orders
It did not surprise me that when I sought out my room on an upper floor of the Hotel de France I found Blenkiron in the corridor
He was in the best of spirits
You cant keep me out of the show Dick he said so you neednt start arguing
Why this is the one original chance of a lifetime for John S Blenkiron
Our little fight at Erzerum was only a sideshow but this is a real highclass Armageddon
I guess Ill find a way to make myself useful
I had no doubt he would and I was glad he had stayed behind
But I felt it was hard on Peter to have the job of returning to England alone at such a time like useless flotsam washed up by a flood
You neednt worry said Blenkiron
Peters not making England this trip
To the best of my knowledge he has beat it out of this township by the eastern postern
He had some talk with Sir Archibald Roylance and presently other gentlemen of the Royal Flying Corps appeared and the upshot was that Sir Archibald hitched on to Peters grip and departed without saying farewell
My notion is that hes gone to have a few words with his old friends at some flying station
Or he might have the idea of going back to England by aeroplane and so having one last flutter before he folds his wings
Anyhow Peter looked a mighty happy man
The last I saw he was smoking his pipe with a batch of young lads in a Flying Corps waggon and heading straight for Germany
CHAPTER TWENTYONE How an Exile Returned to His Own People Next morning I found the Army Commander on his way to Doullens
Take over the division
he said
Certainly
Im afraid there isnt much left of it
Ill tell Carr to get through to the Corps Headquarters when he can find them
Youll have to nurse the remnants for they cant be pulled out yet  not for a day or two
Bless me Hannay there are parts of our line which were holding with a man and a boy
Youve got to stick it out till the French take over
Were not hanging on by our eyelids  its our eyelashes now
What about positions to fall back on sir
I asked
Were doing our best but we havent enough men to prepare them
He plucked open a map
There were digging a line  and there
If we can hold that bit for two days we shall have a fair line resting on the river
But we maynt have time
Then I told him about Blenkiron whom of course he had heard of
He was one of the biggest engineers in the States and hes got a nailing fine eye for country
Hell make good somehow if you let him help in the job
The very fellow he said and he wrote an order
Take this to Jacks and hell fix up a temporary commission
Your man can find a uniform somewhere in Amiens
After that I went to the detail camp and found that Ivery had duly arrived
The prisoner has given no trouble sirr Hamilton reported
But hes a wee thing peevish
Theyre saying that the Gairmans is gettin on fine and I was tellin him that he should be proud of his ain folk
But he wasnt verra weel pleased
Three days had wrought a transformation in Ivery
That face once so cool and capable was now sharpened like a hunted beasts
His imagination was preying on him and I could picture its torture
He who had been always at the top directing the machine was now only a cog in it
He had never in his life been anything but powerful now he was impotent
He was in a hard unfamiliar world in the grip of something which he feared and didnt understand in the charge of men who were in no way amenable to his persuasiveness
It was like a proud and bullying manager suddenly forced to labour in a squad of navvies and worse for there was the gnawing physical fear of what was coming
He made an appeal to me
Do the English torture their prisoners
he asked
You have beaten me
I own it and I plead for mercy
I will go on my knees if you like
I am not afraid of death  in my own way
Few people are afraid of death  in their own way
Why do you degrade me
I am a gentleman
Not as we define the thing I said
His jaw dropped
What are you going to do with me
he quavered
You have been a soldier I said
You are going to see a little fighting  from the ranks
There will be no brutality you will be armed if you want to defend yourself you will have the same chance of survival as the men around you
You may have heard that your countrymen are doing well
It is even possible that they may win the battle
What was your forecast to me
Amiens in two days Abbeville in three
Well you are a little behind scheduled time but still you are prospering
You told me that you were the chief architect of all this and you are going to be given the chance of seeing it perhaps of sharing in it  from the other side
Does it not appeal to your sense of justice
He groaned and turned away
I had no more pity for him than I would have had for a black mamba that had killed my friend and was now caught to a cleft tree
Nor oddly enough had Wake
If we had shot Ivery outright at St Anton I am certain that Wake would have called us murderers
Now he was in complete agreement
His passionate hatred of war made him rejoice that a chief contriver of war should be made to share in its terrors
He tried to talk me over this morning he told me
Claimed he was on my side and said the kind of thing I used to say last year
It made me rather ashamed of some of my past performances to hear that scoundrel imitating them  By the way Hannay what are you going to do with me
Youre coming on my staff
Youre a stout fellow and I cant do without you
Remember I wont fight
You wont be asked to
Were trying to stem the tide which wants to roll to the sea
You know how the Boche behaves in occupied country and Marys in Amiens
At that news he shut his lips
Still he began
still I said
I dont ask you to forfeit one of your blessed principles
You neednt fire a shot
But I want a man to carry orders for me for we havent a line any more only a lot of blobs like quicksilver
I want a clever man for the job and a brave one and I know that youre not afraid
No he said
I dont think I am  much
Well
Im content
I started Blenkiron off in a car for Corps Headquarters and in the afternoon took the road myself
I knew every inch of the country  the lift of the hill east of Amiens the Roman highway that ran straight as an arrow to St Quentin the marshy lagoons of the Somme and that broad strip of land wasted by battle between Dompierre and Peronne
I had come to Amiens through it in January for I had been up to the line before I left for Paris and then it had been a peaceful place with peasants tilling their fields and new buildings going up on the old battlefield and carpenters busy at cottage roofs and scarcely a transport waggon on the road to remind one of war
Now the main route was choked like the Albert road when the Somme battle first began  troops going up and troops coming down the latter in the last stage of weariness a ceaseless traffic of ambulances one way and ammunition waggons the other busy staff cars trying to worm a way through the mass strings of gun horses oddments of cavalry and here and there blue French uniforms
All that I had seen before but one thing was new to me
Little country carts with sadfaced women and mystified children in them and piles of household plenishing were creeping westward or stood waiting at village doors
Beside these tramped old men and boys mostly in their Sunday best as if they were going to church
I had never seen the sight before for I had never seen the British Army falling back
The dam which held up the waters had broken and the dwellers in the valley were trying to save their pitiful little treasures
And over everything horse and man cart and wheelbarrow road and tillage lay the white March dust the sky was blue as June small birds were busy in the copses and in the corners of abandoned gardens I had a glimpse of the first violets
Presently as we topped a rise we came within full noise of the guns
That too was new to me for it was no ordinary bombardment
There was a special quality in the sound something ragged straggling intermittent which I had never heard before
It was the sign of open warfare and a moving battle
At Peronne from which the newly returned inhabitants had a second time fled the battle seemed to be at the doors
There I had news of my division
It was farther south towards St Christ
We groped our way among bad roads to where its headquarters were believed to be while the voice of the guns grew louder
They turned out to be those of another division which was busy getting ready to cross the river
Then the dark fell and while airplanes flew west into the sunset there was a redder sunset in the east where the unceasing flashes of gunfire were pale against the angry glow of burning dumps
The sight of the bonnetbadge of a Scots Fusilier made me halt and the man turned out to belong to my division
Half an hour later I was taking over from the muchrelieved Masterton in the ruins of what had once been a sugarbeet factory
There to my surprise I found Lefroy
The Boche had held him prisoner for precisely eight hours
During that time he had been so interested in watching the way the enemy handled an attack that he had forgotten the miseries of his position
He described with blasphemous admiration the endless wheel by which supplies and reserve troops move up the silence the smoothness the perfect discipline
Then he had realized that he was a captive and unwounded and had gone mad
Being a heavyweight boxer of note he had sent his two guards spinning into a ditch dodged the ensuing shots and found shelter in the lee of a blazing ammunition dump where his pursuers hesitated to follow
Then he had spent an anxious hour trying to get through an outpost line which he thought was Boche
Only by overhearing an exchange of oaths in the accents of Dundee did he realize that it was our own 
It was a comfort to have Lefroy back for he was both stouthearted and resourceful
But I found that I had a division only on paper
It was about the strength of a brigade the brigades battalions and the battalions companies
This is not the place to write the story of the week that followed
I could not write it even if I wanted to for I dont know it
There was a plan somewhere which you will find in the history books but with me it was blank chaos
Orders came but long before they arrived the situation had changed and I could no more obey them than fly to the moon
Often I had lost touch with the divisions on both flanks
Intelligence arrived erratically out of the void and for the most part we worried along without it
I heard we were under the French  first it was said to be Foch and then Fayolle whom I had met in Paris
But the higher command seemed a million miles away and we were left to use our mother wits
My problem was to give ground as slowly as possible and at the same time not to delay too long for retreat we must with the Boche sending in brandnew divisions each morning
It was a kind of war worlds distant from the old trench battles and since I had been taught no other I had to invent rules as I went along
Looking back it seems a miracle that any of us came out of it
Only the grace of God and the uncommon toughness of the British soldier bluffed the Hun and prevented him pouring through the breach to Abbeville and the sea
We were no better than a mosquito curtain stuck in a doorway to stop the advance of an angry bull
The Army Commander was right we were hanging on with our eyelashes
We must have been easily the weakest part of the whole front for we were holding a line which was never less than two miles and was often as I judged nearer five and there was nothing in reserve to us except some oddments of cavalry who chased about the whole battlefield under vague orders
Mercifully for us the Boche blundered
Perhaps he did not know our condition for our airmen were magnificent and you never saw a Boche plane over our line by day though they bombed us merrily by night
If he had called our bluff we should have been done but he put his main strength to the north and the south of us
North he pressed hard on the Third Army but he got well hammered by the Guards north of Bapaume and he could make no headway at Arras
South he drove at the Paris railway and down the Oise valley but there Petains reserves had arrived and the French made a noble stand
Not that he didnt fight hard in the centre where we were but he hadnt his best troops and after we got west of the bend of the Somme he was outrunning his heavy guns
Still it was a desperate enough business for our flanks were all the time falling back and we had to conform to movements we could only guess at
After all we were on the direct route to Amiens and it was up to us to yield slowly so as to give Haig and Petain time to get up supports
I was a miser about every yard of ground for every yard and every minute were precious
We alone stood between the enemy and the city and in the city was Mary
If you ask me about our plans I cant tell you
I had a new one every hour
I got instructions from the Corps but as I have said they were usually out of date before they arrived and most of my tactics I had to invent myself
I had a plain task and to fulfil it I had to use what methods the Almighty allowed me
I hardly slept I ate little I was on the move day and night but I never felt so strong in my life
It seemed as if I couldnt tire and oddly enough I was happy
If a mans whole being is focused on one aim he has no time to worry 
I remember we were all very gentle and soft spoken those days
Lefroy whose tongue was famous for its edge now cooed like a dove
The troops were on their uppers but as steady as rocks
We were against the end of the world and that stiffens a man  Day after day saw the same performance
I held my wavering front with an outpost line which delayed each new attack till I could take its bearings
I had special companies for counterattack at selected points when I wanted time to retire the rest of the division
I think we must have fought more than a dozen of such little battles
We lost men all the time but the enemy made no big scoop though he was always on the edge of one
Looking back it seems like a succession of miracles
Often I was in one end of a village when the Boche was in the other
Our batteries were always on the move and the work of the gunners was past praising
Sometimes we faced east sometimes north and once at a most critical moment due south for our front waved and blew like a flag at a masthead 
Thank God the enemy was getting away from his big engine and his ordinary troops were fagged and poor in quality
It was when his fresh shock battalions came on that I held my breath 
He had a heathenish amount of machineguns and he used them beautifully
Oh I take my hat off to the Boche performance
He was doing what we had tried to do at the Somme and the Aisne and Arras and Ypres and he was more or less succeeding
And the reason was that he was going baldheaded for victory
The men as I have said were wonderfully steady and patient under the fiercest trial that soldiers can endure
I had all kinds in the division  old army new army Territorials  and you couldnt pick and choose between them
They fought like Trojans and dirty weary and hungry found still some salt of humour in their sufferings
It was a proof of the rockbottom sanity of human nature
But we had one man with us who was hardly sane

In the hustle of those days I now and then caught sight of Ivery
I had to be everywhere at all hours and often visited that remnant of Scots Fusiliers into which the subtlest brain in Europe had been drafted
He and his keepers were never on outpost duty or in any counterattack
They were part of the mass whose only business was to retire discreetly
This was childs play to Hamilton who had been out since Mons and Amos after taking a day to get used to it wrapped himself in his grim philosophy and rather enjoyed it
You couldnt surprise Amos any more than a Turk
But the man with them whom they never left  that was another matter
For the first wee bit Hamilton reported we thocht he was gaun daft
Every shell that came near he jumped like a young horse
And the gas
We had to tie on his mask for him for his hands were fushionless
There was whiles when he wadna be hindered from standin up and talkin to hisself though the bullets was spittin
He was what ye call demoralized  Syne he got as though he didna hear or see onything
He did what we tellt him and when we let him be he sat down and grat
Hes aye greetin  Queer thing sirr but the Gairmans canna hit him
Im aye shakin bullets out o my claes and Ive got a hole in my shoulder and Andra took a bash on his tin that wad hae felled onybody that hadna a heid like a stot
But sirr the prisoner taks no scaith
Our boys are feared of him
There was an Irishman says to me that he had the evil eye and ye can see for yerself that hes no canny
I saw that his skin had become like parchment and that his eyes were glassy
I dont think he recognized me
Does he take his meals
I asked
He doesna eat muckle
But he has an unco thirst
Ye canna keep him off the mens waterbottles
He was learning very fast the meaning of that war he had so confidently played with
I believe I am a merciful man but as I looked at him I felt no vestige of pity
He was dreeing the weird he had prepared for others
I thought of Scudder of the thousand friends I had lost of the great seas of blood and the mountains of sorrow this man and his like had made for the world
Out of the corner of my eye I could see the long ridges above Combles and Longueval which the salt of the earth had fallen to win and which were again under the hoof of the Boche
I thought of the distracted city behind us and what it meant to me and the weak the pitifully weak screen which was all its defence
I thought of the foul deeds which had made the German name to stink by land and sea foulness of which he was the archbegetter
And then I was amazed at our forbearance
He would go mad and madness for him was more decent than sanity
I had another man who wasnt what you might call normal and that was Wake
He was the opposite of shellshocked if you understand me
He had never been properly under fire before but he didnt give a straw for it
I had known the same thing with other men and they generally ended by crumpling up for it isnt natural that five or six feet of human flesh shouldnt be afraid of what can torture and destroy it
The natural thing is to be always a little scared like me but by an effort of the will and attention to work to contrive to forget it
But Wake apparently never gave it a thought
He wasnt foolhardy only indifferent
He used to go about with a smile on his face a smile of contentment
Even the horrors  and we had plenty of them  didnt affect him
His eyes which used to be hot had now a curious open innocence like Peters
I would have been happier if he had been a little rattled
One night after we had had a bad day of anxiety I talked to him as we smoked in what had once been a French dugout
He was an extra right arm to me and I told him so
This must be a queer experience for you I said
Yes he replied it is very wonderful
I did not think a man could go through it and keep his reason
But I know many things I did not know before
I know that the soul can be reborn without leaving the body
I stared at him and he went on without looking at me
Youre not a classical scholar Hannay
There was a strange cult in the ancient world the worship of Magna Mater  the Great Mother
To enter into her mysteries the votary passed through a bath of blood    I think I am passing through that bath
I think that like the initiate I shall be renatus in aeternum  reborn into the eternal
I advised him to have a drink for that talk frightened me
It looked as if he were becoming what the Scots call fey
Lefroy noticed the same thing and was always speaking about it
He was as brave as a bull himself and with very much the same kind of courage but Wakes gallantry perturbed him
I cant make the chap out he told me
He behaves as if his mind was too full of better things to give a damn for Boche guns
He doesnt take foolish risks  I dont mean that but he behaves as if risks didnt signify
Its positively eerie to see him making notes with a steady hand when shells are dropping like hailstones and were all thinking every minutes our last
Youve got to be careful with him sir
Hes a long sight too valuable for us to spare
Lefroy was right about that for I dont know what I should have done without him
The worst part of our job was to keep touch with our flanks and that was what I used Wake for
He covered country like a mosstrooper sometimes on a rusty bicycle oftener on foot and you couldnt tire him
I wonder what other divisions thought of the grimy private who was our chief means of communication
He knew nothing of military affairs before but he got the hang of this roughandtumble fighting as if he had been born for it
He never fired a shot he carried no arms the only weapons he used were his brains
And they were the best conceivable
I never met a staff officer who was so quick at getting a point or at sizing up a situation
He had put his back into the business and firstclass talent is not common anywhere
One day a G S O from a neighbouring division came to see me
Where on earth did you pick up that man Wake
he asked
Hes a conscientious objector and a noncombatant I said
Then I wish to Heaven we had a few more conscientious objectors in this show
Hes the only fellow who seems to know anything about this blessed battle
My generals sending you a chit about him
No need I said laughing
I know his value
Hes an old friend of mine
I used Wake as my link with Corps Headquarters and especially with Blenkiron
For about the sixth day of the show I was beginning to get rather desperate
This kind of thing couldnt go on for ever
We were miles back now behind the old line Of 17 and as we rested one flank on the river the immediate situation was a little easier
But I had lost a lot of men and those that were left were blind with fatigue
The big bulges of the enemy to north and south had added to the length of the total front and I found I had to fan out my thin ranks
The Boche was still pressing on though his impetus was slacker
If he knew how little there was to stop him in my section he might make a push which would carry him to Amiens
Only the magnificent work of our airmen had prevented him getting that knowledge but we couldnt keep the secrecy up for ever
Some day an enemy plane would get over and it only needed the drive of a fresh stormbattalion or two to scatter us
I wanted a good prepared position with sound trenches and decent wiring
Above all I wanted reserves  reserves
The word was on my lips all day and it haunted my dreams
I was told that the French were to relieve us but when  when
My reports to Corps Headquarters were one long wail for more troops
I knew there was a position prepared behind us but I needed men to hold it
Wake brought in a message from Blenkiron
Were waiting for you Dick he wrote and weve gotten quite a nice little home ready for you
This old man hasnt hustled so hard since he struck copper in Montana in 92
Weve dug three lines of trenches and made a heap of pretty redoubts and I guess theyre well laid out for the Army staff has supervised them and theyre no slouches at this brand of engineering
You would have laughed to see the labour we employed
We had all breeds of Dago and Chinaman and some of your own South African blacks and they got so busy on the job they forgot about bedtime
I used to be reckoned a bit of a slave driver but my special talents werent needed with this push
Im going to put a lot of money into foreign missions henceforward
I wrote back Your trenches are no good without men
For Gods sake get something that can hold a rifle
My lot are done to the world
Then I left Lefroy with the division and went down on the back of an ambulance to see for myself
I found Blenkiron some of the Army engineers and a staff officer from Corps Headquarters and I found Archie Roylance
They had dug a mighty good line and wired it nobly
It ran from the river to the wood of La Bruyere on the little hill above the Ablain stream
It was desperately long but I saw at once it couldnt well be shorter for the division on the south of us had its hands full with the fringe of the big thrust against the French
Its no good blinking the facts I told them
I havent a thousand men and what I have are at the end of their tether
If you put em in these trenches theyll go to sleep on their feet
When can the French take over
I was told that it had been arranged for next morning but that it had now been put off twentyfour hours
It was only a temporary measure pending the arrival of British divisions from the north
Archie looked grave
The Boche is pushin up new troops in this sector
We got the news before I left squadron headquarters
It looks as if it would be a near thing sir
It wont be a near thing
Its an absolute black certainty
My fellows cant carry on as they are another day
Great God theyve had a fortnight in hell
Find me more men or we buckle up at the next push
My temper was coming very near its limits
Weve raked the country with a smalltooth comb sir said one of the staff officers
And weve raised a scratch pack
Best part of two thousand
Good men but most of them know nothing about infantry fighting
Weve put them into platoons and done our best to give them some kind of training
Theres one thing may cheer you
Weve plenty of machineguns
Theres a machinegun school near by and we got all the men who were taking the course and all the plant
I dont suppose there was ever such a force put into the field before
It was a wilder medley than Moussys campfollowers at First Ypres
There was every kind of detail in the shape of men returning from leave representing most of the regiments in the army
There were the men from the machinegun school
There were Corps troops  sappers and ASC and a handful of Corps cavalry
Above all there was a batch of American engineers fathered by Blenkiron
I inspected them where they were drilling and liked the look of them
Fortyeight hours I said to myself
With luck we may just pull it off
Then I borrowed a bicycle and went back to the division
But before I left I had a word with Archie
This is one big game of bluff and its you fellows alone that enable us to play it
Tell your people that everything depends on them
They mustnt stint the planes in this sector for if the Boche once suspicions how little hes got before him the games up
Hes not a fool and he knows that this is the short road to Amiens but he imagines were holding it in strength
If we keep up the fiction for another two days the things done
You say hes pushing up troops
Yes and hes sendin forward his tanks
Well thatll take time
Hes slower now than a week ago and hes got a deuce of a country to march over
Theres still an outside chance we may win through
You go home and tell the RFC
what Ive told you
He nodded
By the way sir Pienaars with the squadron
He would like to come up and see you
Archie I said solemnly be a good chap and do me a favour
If I think Peters anywhere near the line Ill go off my head with worry
This is no place for a man with a bad leg
He should have been in England days ago
Cant you get him off  to Amiens anyhow
We scarcely like to
You see were all desperately sorry for him his fun gone and his career over and all that
He likes bein with us and listenin to our yarns
He has been up once or twice too
The SharkGladas
He swears its a great make and certainly he knows how to handle the little devil
Then for Heavens sake dont let him do it again
I look to you Archie remember
Promise
Funny thing but hes always worryin about you
He has a map on which he marks every day the changes in the position and hed hobble a mile to pump any of our fellows who have been up your way
That night under cover of darkness I drew back the division to the newly prepared lines
We got away easily for the enemy was busy with his own affairs
I suspected a relief by fresh troops
There was no time to lose and I can tell you I toiled to get things straight before dawn
I would have liked to send my own fellows back to rest but I couldnt spare them yet
I wanted them to stiffen the fresh lot for they were veterans
The new position was arranged on the same principles as the old front which had been broken on March 21st
There was our forward zone consisting of an outpost line and redoubts very cleverly sited and a line of resistance
Well behind it were the trenches which formed the battlezone
Both zones were heavily wired and we had plenty of machineguns I wish I could say we had plenty of men who knew how to use them
The outposts were merely to give the alarm and fall back to the line of resistance which was to hold out to the last
In the forward zone I put the freshest of my own men the units being brought up to something like strength by the details returning from leave that the Corps had commandeered
With them I put the American engineers partly in the redoubts and partly in companies for counterattack
Blenkiron had reported that they could shoot like Danl Boone and were simply spoiling for a fight
The rest of the force was in the battlezone which was our last hope
If that went the Boche had a clear walk to Amiens
Some additional field batteries had been brought up to support our very weak divisional artillery
The front was so long that I had to put all three of my emaciated brigades in the line so I had nothing to speak of in reserve
It was a most almighty gamble
We had found shelter just in time
At 63o next day  for a change it was a clear morning with clouds beginning to bank up from the west  the Boche let us know he was alive
He gave us a good drenching with gas shells which didnt do much harm and then messed up our forward zone with his trench mortars
At 720 his men began to come on first little bunches with machineguns and then the infantry in waves
It was clear they were fresh troops and we learned afterwards from prisoners that they were Bavarians  6th or 7th I forget which but the division that hung us up at Monchy
At the same time there was the sound of a tremendous bombardment across the river
It looked as if the main battle had swung from Albert and Montdidier to a direct push for Amiens
I have often tried to write down the events of that day
I tried it in my report to the Corps I tried it in my own diary I tried it because Mary wanted it but I have never been able to make any story that hung together
Perhaps I was too tired for my mind to retain clear impressions though at the time I was not conscious of special fatigue
More likely it is because the fight itself was so confused for nothing happened according to the books and the orderly soul of the Boche must have been scarified  At first it went as I expected
The outpost line was pushed in but the fire from the redoubts broke up the advance and enabled the line of resistance in the forward zone to give a good account of itself
There was a check and then another big wave assisted by a barrage from fieldguns brought far forward
This time the line of resistance gave at several points and Lefroy flung in the Americans in a counterattack
That was a mighty performance
The engineers yelling like dervishes went at it with the bayonet and those that preferred swung their rifles as clubs
It was terribly costly fighting and all wrong but it succeeded
They cleared the Boche out of a ruined farm he had rushed and a little wood and reestablished our front
Blenkiron who saw it all for he went with them and got the tip of an ear picked off by a machinegun bullet hadnt any words wherewith to speak of it
And I once said those boys looked puffy he moaned
The next phase which came about midday was the tanks
I had never seen the German variety but had heard that it was speedier and heavier than ours but unwieldy
We did not see much of their speed but we found out all about their clumsiness
Had the things been properly handled they should have gone through us like rotten wood
But the whole outfit was bungled
It looked good enough country for the use of them but the men who made our position had had an eye to this possibility
The great monsters mounting a fieldgun besides other contrivances wanted something like a highroad to be happy in
They were useless over anything like difficult ground
The ones that came down the main road got on well enough at the start but Blenkiron very sensibly had mined the highway and we blew a hole like a diamond pit
One lay helpless at the foot of it and we took the crew prisoner another stuck its nose over and remained there till our fieldguns got the range and knocked it silly
As for the rest  there is a marshy lagoon called the Patte dOie beside the farm of Gavrelle which runs all the way north to the river though in most places it only seems like a soft patch in the meadows
This the tanks had to cross to reach our line and they never made it
Most got bogged and made pretty targets for our gunners one or two returned and one the Americans creeping forward under cover of a little stream blew up with a time fuse
By the middle of the afternoon I was feeling happier
I knew the big attack was still to come but I had my forward zone intact and I hoped for the best
I remember I was talking to Wake who had been going between the two zones when I got the first warning of a new and unexpected peril
A dud shell plumped down a few yards from me
Those fools across the river are firing short and badly off the straight I said
Wake examined the shell
No its a German one he said
Then came others and there could be no mistake about the direction  followed by a burst of machinegun fire from the same quarter
We ran in cover to a point from which we could see the north bank of the river and I got my glass on it
There was a lift of land from behind which the fire was coming
We looked at each other and the same conviction stood in both faces
The Boche had pushed down the northern bank and we were no longer in line with our neighbours
The enemy was in a situation to catch us with his fire on our flank and left rear
We couldnt retire to conform for to retire meant giving up our prepared position
It was the last straw to all our anxieties and for a moment I was at the end of my wits
I turned to Wake and his calm eyes pulled me together
If they cant retake that ground were fairly carted I said
We are
Therefore they must retake it
I must get on to Mitchinson
But as I spoke I realized the futility of a telephone message to a man who was pretty hard up against it himself
Only an urgent appeal could effect anything 
I must go myself  No that was impossible
I must send Lefroy 
But he couldnt be spared
And all my staff officers were up to their necks in the battle
Besides none of them knew the position as I knew it  And how to get there
It was a long way round by the bridge at Loisy
Suddenly I was aware of Wakes voice
You had better send me he was saying
Theres only one way  to swim the river a little lower down
Thats too damnably dangerous
I wont send any man to certain death
But I volunteer he said
That I believe is always allowed in war
But youll be killed before you can cross
Send a man with me to watch
If I get over you may be sure Ill get to General Mitchinson
If not send somebody else by Loisy
Theres desperate need for hurry and you see yourself its the only way
The time was past for argument
I scribbled a line to Mitchinson as his credentials
No more was needed for Wake knew the position as well as I did
I sent an orderly to accompany him to his starting place on the bank
Goodbye he said as we shook hands
Youll see Ill come back all right
His face I remember looked singularly happy
Five minutes later the Boche guns opened for the final attack
I believe I kept a cool head at least so Lefroy and the others reported
They said I went about all afternoon grinning as if I liked it and that I never raised my voice once
Its rather a fault of mine that I bellow in a scrap
But I know I was feeling anything but calm for the problem was ghastly
It all depended on Wake and Mitchinson
The flanking fire was so bad that I had to give up the left of the forward zone which caught it fairly and retire the men there to the battlezone
The latter was better protected for between it and the river was a small wood and the bank rose into a bluff which sloped inwards towards us
This withdrawal meant a switch and a switch isnt a pretty thing when it has to be improvised in the middle of a battle
The Boche had counted on that flanking fire
His plan was to break our two wings  the old Boche plan which crops up in every fight
He left our centre at first pretty well alone and thrust along the river bank and to the wood of La Bruyere where we linked up with the division on our right
Lefroy was in the first area and Masterton in the second and for three hours it was as desperate a business as I have ever faced 
The improvised switch went and more and more of the forward zone disappeared
It was a hot clear spring afternoon and in the open fighting the enemy came on like troops at manoeuvres
On the left they got into the battlezone and I can see yet Lefroys great figure leading a counterattack in person his face all puddled with blood from a scalp wound 
I would have given my soul to be in two places at once but I had to risk our left and keep close to Masterton who needed me most
The wood of La Bruyere was the maddest sight
Again and again the Boche was almost through it
You never knew where he was and most of the fighting there was duels between machinegun parties
Some of the enemy got round behind us and only a fine performance of a company of Cheshires saved a complete breakthrough
As for Lefroy I dont know how he stuck it out and he doesnt know himself for he was galled all the time by that accursed flanking fire
I got a note about half past four saying that Wake had crossed the river but it was some weary hours after that before the fire slackened
I tore back and forward between my wings and every time I went north I expected to find that Lefroy had broken
But by some miracle he held
The Boches were in his battlezone time and again but he always flung them out
I have a recollection of Blenkiron stark mad encouraging his Americans with strange tongues
Once as I passed him I saw that he had his left arm tied up
His blackened face grinned at me
This bit of landscapes mighty unsafe for democracy he croaked
For the love of Mike get your guns on to those devils across the river
Theyre plaguing my boys too bad
It was about seven oclock I think when the flanking fire slacked off but it was not because of our divisional guns
There was a short and very furious burst of artillery fire on the north bank and I knew it was British
Then things began to happen
One of our planes  they had been marvels all day swinging down like hawks for machinegun bouts with the Boche infantry  reported that Mitchinson was attacking hard and getting on well
That eased my mind and I started off for Masterton who was in greater straits than ever for the enemy seemed to be weakening on the river bank and putting his main strength in against our right 
But my GSO2 stopped me on the road
Wake he said
He wants to see you
Not now I cried
He cant live many minutes
I turned and followed him to the ruinous cowshed which was my divisional headquarters
Wake as I heard later had swum the river opposite to Mitchinsons right and reached the other shore safely though the current was whipped with bullets
But he had scarcely landed before he was badly hit by shrapnel in the groin
Walking at first with support and then carried on a stretcher he managed to struggle on to the divisional headquarters where he gave my message and explained the situation
He would not let his wound be looked to till his job was done
Mitchinson told me afterwards that with a face grey from pain he drew for him a sketch of our position and told him exactly how near we were to our end  After that he asked to be sent back to me and they got him down to Loisy in a crowded ambulance and then up to us in a returning empty
The MO
who looked at his wound saw that the thing was hopeless and did not expect him to live beyond Loisy
He was bleeding internally and no surgeon on earth could have saved him
When he reached us he was almost pulseless but he recovered for a moment and asked for me
I found him with blue lips and a face drained of blood lying on my camp bed
His voice was very small and far away
How goes it
he asked
Please God well pull through  thanks to you old man
Good he said and his eyes shut
He opened them once again
Funny thing life
A year ago I was preaching peace 
Im still preaching it 
Im not sorry
I held his hand till two minutes later he died
In the press of a fight one scarcely realizes death even the death of a friend
It was up to me to make good my assurance to Wake and presently I was off to Masterton
There in that shambles of La Bruyere while the light faded there was a desperate and most bloody struggle
It was the last lap of the contest
Twelve hours now I kept telling myself and the French will be here and well have done our task
Alas
how many of us would go back to rest
 Hardly able to totter our counterattacking companies went in again
They had gone far beyond the limits of mortal endurance but the human spirit can defy all natural laws
The balance trembled hung and then dropped the right way
The enemy impetus weakened stopped and the ebb began
I wanted to complete the job
Our artillery put up a sharp barrage and the little I had left comparatively fresh I sent in for a counter stroke
Most of the men were untrained but there was that in our ranks which dispensed with training and we had caught the enemy at the moment of lowest vitality
We pushed him out of La Bruyere we pushed him back to our old forward zone we pushed him out of that zone to the position from which he had begun the day
But there was no rest for the weary
We had lost at least a third of our strength and we had to man the same long line
We consolidated it as best we could started to replace the wiring that had been destroyed found touch with the division on our right and established outposts
Then after a conference with my brigadiers I went back to my headquarters too tired to feel either satisfaction or anxiety
In eight hours the French would be here
The words made a kind of litany in my ears
In the cowshed where Wake had lain two figures awaited me
The talcenclosed candle revealed Hamilton and Amos dirty beyond words smokeblackened bloodstained and intricately bandaged
They stood stiffly to attention
Sirr the prisoner said Hamilton
I have to report that the prisoner is deid
I stared at them for I had forgotten Ivery
He seemed a creature of a world that had passed away
Sirr it was like this
Ever sin this mornin the prisoner seemed to wake up
Yell mind that he was in a kind of dream all week
But he got some new notion in his heid and when the battle began he exheebited signs of restlessness
Whiles he wad lie doun in the trench and whiles he was wantin back to the dugout
Accordin to instructions I provided him wi a rifle but he didna seem to ken how to handle it
It was your orders sirr that he was to have means to defend hisself if the enemy cam on so Amos gied him a trench knife
But verra soon he looked as if he was ettlin to cut his throat so I deprived him of it
Hamilton stopped for breath
He spoke as if he were reciting a lesson with no stops between the sentences
I jaloused sirr that he wadna last oot the day and Amos here was of the same opinion
The end came at twenty minutes past three  I ken the time for I had just compared my watch with Amos
Yell mind that the Gairmans were beginning a big attack
We were in the front trench of what they ca the battlezone and Amos and me was keepin oor eyes on the enemy who could be obsairved dribblin ower the open
just then the prisoner catches sight of the enemy and jumps up on the top
Amos tried to hold him but he kicked him in the face
The next we kenned he was runnin verra fast towards the enemy holdin his hands ower his heid and crying out loud in a foreign langwidge
It was German said the scholarly Amos through his broken teeth
It was Gairman continued Hamilton
It seemed as if he was appealin to the enemy to help him
But they paid no attention and he cam under the fire of their machineguns
We watched him spin round like a teetotum and kenned that he was bye with it
You are sure he was killed
I asked
Yes sirr
When we counterattacked we fund his body
There is a grave close by the farm of Gavrelle and a wooden cross at its head bears the name of the Graf von Schwabing and the date of his death
The Germans took Gavrelle a little later
I am glad to think that they read that inscription
CHAPTER TWENTYTWO The Summons Comes for Mr Standfast I slept for one and threequarter hours that night and when I awoke I seemed to emerge from deeps of slumber which had lasted for days
That happens sometimes after heavy fatigue and great mental strain
Even a short sleep sets up a barrier between past and present which has to be elaborately broken down before you can link on with what has happened before
As my wits groped at the job some drops of rain splashed on my face through the broken roof
That hurried me outofdoors
It was just after dawn and the sky was piled with thick clouds while a wet wind blew up from the southwest
The longprayedfor break in the weather seemed to have come at last
A deluge of rain was what I wanted something to soak the earth and turn the roads into watercourses and clog the enemy transport something above all to blind the enemys eyes  For I remembered what a preposterous bluff it all had been and what a piteous broken handful stood between the Germans and their goal
If they knew if they only knew they would brush us aside like flies
As I shaved I looked back on the events of yesterday as on something that had happened long ago
I seemed to judge them impersonally and I concluded that it had been a pretty good fight
A scratch force half of it dogtired and half of it untrained had held up at least a couple of fresh divisions 
But we couldnt do it again and there were still some hours before us of desperate peril
When had the Corps said that the French would arrive

I was on the point of shouting for Hamilton to get Wake to ring up Corps Headquarters when I remembered that Wake was dead
I had liked him and greatly admired him but the recollection gave me scarcely a pang
We were all dying and he had only gone on a stage ahead
There was no morning strafe such as had been our usual fortune in the past week
I went outofdoors and found a noiseless world under the lowering sky
The rain had stopped falling the wind of dawn had lessened and I feared that the storm would be delayed
I wanted it at once to help us through the next hours of tension
Was it in six hours that the French were coming
No it must be four
It couldnt be more than four unless somebody had made an infernal muddle
I wondered why everything was so quiet
It would be breakfast time on both sides but there seemed no stir of mans presence in that ugly strip half a mile off
Only far back in the German hinterland I seemed to hear the rumour of traffic
An unslept and unshaven figure stood beside me which revealed itself as Archie Roylance
Been up all night he said cheerfully lighting a cigarette
No I havent had breakfast
The skipper thought wed better get another antiaircraft battery up this way and I was superintendin the job
Hes afraid of the Hun gettin over your lines and spying out the nakedness of the land
For you know were uncommon naked sir
Also and Archies face became grave the Huns pourin divisions down on this sector
As I judge hes blowin up for a thunderin big drive on both sides of the river
Our lads yesterday said all the country back of Peronne was lousy with new troops
And hes gettin his big guns forward too
You havent been troubled with them yet but he has got the roads mended and the devil of a lot of new light railways and any moment well have the fivepointnines sayin Goodmornin  Pray Heaven you get relieved in time sir
I take it theres not much risk of another push this mornin
I dont think so
The Boche took a nasty knock yesterday and he must fancy were pretty strong after that counterattack
I dont think hell strike till he can work both sides of the river and thatll take time to prepare
Thats what his fresh divisions are for 
But remember he can attack now if he likes
If he knew how weak we were hes strong enough to send us all to glory in the next three hours
Its just that knowledge that you fellows have got to prevent his getting
If a single Hun plane crosses our lines and returns were wholly and utterly done
Youve given us splendid help since the show began Archie
For Gods sake keep it up to the finish and put every machine you can spare in this sector
Were doin our best he said
We got some more fightin scouts down from the north and were keepin our eyes skinned
But you know as well as I do sir that its never an absolute certainty
If the Hun sent over a squadron we might beat em all down but one and that one might do the trick
Its a matter of luck
The Huns got the wind up all right in the air just now and I dont blame the poor devil
Im inclined to think we havent had the pick of his push here
Jennings says hes doin good work in Flanders and they reckon theres the deuce of a thrust comin there pretty soon
I think we can manage the kind of footler hes been sendin over here lately but if Lensch or some lad like that were to choose to turn up I wouldnt say what might happen
The airs a big lottery and Archie turned a dirty face skyward where two of our planes were moving very high towards the east
The mention of Lensch brought Peter to mind and I asked if he had gone back
He wont go said Archie and we havent the heart to make him
Hes very happy and plays about with the Gladas single seater
Hes always speakin about you sir and itd break his heart if we shifted him
I asked about his health and was told that he didnt seem to have much pain
But hes a bit queer and Archie shook a sage head
One of the reasons why he wont budge is because he says God has some work for him to do
Hes quite serious about it and ever since he got the notion he has perked up amazin
Hes always askin about Lensch too  not vindictive like you understand but quite friendly
Seems to take a sort of proprietary interest in him
I told him Lensch had had a far longer spell of firstclass fightin than anybody else and was bound by the law of averages to be downed soon and he was quite sad about it
I had no time to worry about Peter
Archie and I swallowed breakfast and I had a powwow with my brigadiers
By this time I had got through to Corps HQ
and got news of the French
It was worse than I expected
General Peguy would arrive about ten oclock but his men couldnt take over till well after midday
The Corps gave me their whereabouts and I found it on the map
They had a long way to cover yet and then there would be the slow business of relieving
I looked at my watch
There were still six hours before us when the Boche might knock us to blazes six hours of maddening anxiety  Lefroy announced that all was quiet on the front and that the new wiring at the Bois de la Bruyere had been completed
Patrols had reported that during the night a fresh German division seemed to have relieved that which we had punished so stoutly yesterday
I asked him if he could stick it out against another attack
No he said without hesitation
Were too few and too shaky on our pins to stand any more
Ive only a man to every three yards
That impressed me for Lefroy was usually the most devilmaycare optimist
Curse it theres the sun I heard Archie cry
It was true for the clouds were rolling back and the centre of the heavens was a patch of blue
The storm was coming  I could smell it in the air  but probably it wouldnt break till the evening
Where I wondered would we be by that time
it was now nine oclock and I was keeping tight hold on myself for I saw that I was going to have hell for the next hours
I am a pretty stolid fellow in some ways but I have always found patience and standing still the most difficult job to tackle and my nerves were all tattered from the long strain of the retreat
I went up to the line and saw the battalion commanders
Everything was unwholesomely quiet there
Then I came back to my headquarters to study the reports that were coming in from the air patrols
They all said the same thing  abnormal activity in the German back areas
Things seemed shaping for a new 21st of March and if our luck were out my poor little remnant would have to take the shock
I telephoned to the Corps and found them as nervous as me
I gave them the details of my strength and heard an agonized whistle at the other end of the line
I was rather glad I had companions in the same purgatory
I found I couldnt sit still
If there had been any work to do I would have buried myself in it but there was none
Only this fearsome job of waiting
I hardly ever feel cold but now my blood seemed to be getting thin and I astonished my staff by putting on a British warm and buttoning up the collar
Round that derelict farm I ranged like a hungry wolf cold at the feet queasy in the stomach and mortally edgy in the mind
Then suddenly the cloud lifted from me and the blood seemed to run naturally in my veins
I experienced the change of mood which a man feels sometimes when his whole being is fined down and clarified by long endurance
The fight of yesterday revealed itself as something rather splendid
What risks we had run and how gallantly we had met them
My heart warmed as I thought of that old division of mine those ragged veterans that were never beaten as long as breath was left them
And the Americans and the boys from the machinegun school and all the oddments we had commandeered
And old Blenkiron raging like a goodtempered lion
It was against reason that such fortitude shouldnt win out
We had snarled round and bitten the Boche so badly that he wanted no more for a little
He would come again but presently we should be relieved and the gallant bluecoats fresh as paint and burning for revenge would be there to worry him
I had no new facts on which to base my optimism only a changed point of view
And with it came a recollection of other things
Wakes death had left me numb before but now the thought of it gave me a sharp pang
He was the first of our little confederacy to go
But what an ending he had made and how happy he had been in that mad time when he had come down from his pedestal and become one of the crowd
He had found himself at the last and who could grudge him such happiness
If the best were to be taken he would be chosen first for he was a big man before whom I uncovered my head
The thought of him made me very humble
I had never had his troubles to face but he had come clean through them and reached a courage which was for ever beyond me
He was the Faithful among us pilgrims who had finished his journey before the rest
Mary had foreseen it
There is a price to be paid she had said the best of us
And at the thought of Mary a flight of warm and happy hopes seemed to settle on my mind
I was looking again beyond the war to that peace which she and I would some day inherit
I had a vision of a green English landscape with its farflung scents of wood and meadow and garden  And that face of all my dreams with the eyes so childlike and brave and honest as if they too saw beyond the dark to a radiant country
A line of an old song which had been a favourite of my fathers sang itself in my ears Theres an eye that ever weeps and a fair face will be fain When I ride through Annan Water wi my bonny bands again
We were standing by the crumbling rails of what had once been the farm sheepfold
I looked at Archie and he smiled back at me for he saw that my face had changed
Then he turned his eyes to the billowing clouds
I felt my arm clutched
Look there
said a fierce voice and his glasses were turned upward
I looked and far up in the sky saw a thing like a wedge of wild geese flying towards us from the enemys country
I made out the small dots which composed it and my glass told me they were planes
But only Archies practised eye knew that they were enemy
Boche
I asked
Boche he said
My God were for it now
My heart had sunk like a stone but I was fairly cool
I looked at my watch and saw that it was ten minutes to eleven
How many
Five said Archie
Or there may be six  not more
Listen
I said
Get on to your headquarters
Tell them that its all up with us if a single plane gets back
Let them get well over the line the deeper in the better and tell them to send up every machine they possess and down them all
Tell them its life or death
Not one single plane goes back
Quick
Archie disappeared and as he went our antiaircraft guns broke out
The formation above opened and zigzagged but they were too high to be in much danger
But they were not too high to see that which we must keep hidden or perish
The roar of our batteries died down as the invaders passed westward
As I watched their progress they seemed to be dropping lower
Then they rose again and a bank of cloud concealed them
I had a horrid certainty that they must beat us that some at any rate would get back
They had seen thin lines and the roads behind us empty of supports
They would see as they advanced the blue columns of the French coming up from the southwest and they would return and tell the enemy that a blow now would open the road to Amiens and the sea
He had plenty of strength for it and presently he would have overwhelming strength
It only needed a spearpoint to burst the jerrybuilt dam and let the flood through 
They would return in twenty minutes and by noon we would be broken
Unless  unless the miracle of miracles happened and they never returned
Archie reported that his skipper would do his damnedest and that our machines were now going up
Weve a chance sir he said a good sportin chance
It was a new Archie with a hard voice a lean face and very old eyes
Behind the jagged walls of the farm buildings was a knoll which had once formed part of the highroad
I went up there alone for I didnt want anybody near me
I wanted a viewpoint and I wanted quiet for I had a grim time before me
From that knoll I had a big prospect of country
I looked east to our lines on which an occasional shell was falling and where I could hear the chatter of machineguns
West there was peace for the woods closed down on the landscape
Up to the north I remember there was a big glare as from a burning dump and heavy guns seemed to be at work in the Ancre valley
Down in the south there was the dull murmur of a great battle
But just around me in the gap the deadliest place of all there was an odd quiet
I could pick out clearly the different sounds
Somebody down at the farm had made a joke and there was a short burst of laughter
I envied the humorist his composure
There was a clatter and jingle from a battery changing position
On the road a tractor was jolting along  I could hear its driver shout and the screech of its unoiled axle
My eyes were glued to my glasses but they shook in my hands so that I could scarcely see
I bit my lip to steady myself but they still wavered
From time to time I glanced at my watch
Eight minutes gone  ten  seventeen
If only the planes would come into sight
Even the certainty of failure would be better than this harrowing doubt
They should be back by now unless they had swung north across the salient or unless the miracle of miracles  Then came the distant yapping of an antiaircraft gun caught up the next second by others while smoke patches studded the distant blue sky
The clouds were banking in midheaven but to the west there was a big clear space now woolly with shrapnel bursts
I counted them mechanically  one  three  five  nine  with despair beginning to take the place of my anxiety
My hands were steady now and through the glasses I saw the enemy
Five attenuated shapes rode high above the bombardment now sharp against the blue now lost in a film of vapour
They were coming back serenely contemptuously having seen all they wanted
The quiet was gone now and the din was monstrous
Antiaircraft guns singly and in groups were firing from every side
As I watched it seemed a futile waste of ammunition
The enemy didnt give a tinkers curse for it 
But surely there was one down
I could only count four now
No there was the fifth coming out of a cloud
In ten minutes they would be all over the line
I fairly stamped in my vexation
Those guns were no more use than a sick headache
Oh where in Gods name were our own planes
At that moment they came streaking down into sight four fightingscouts with the sun glinting on their wings and burnishing their metal cowls
I saw clearly the rings of red white and blue
Before their downward drive the enemy instantly spread out
I was watching with bare eyes now and I wanted companionship for the time of waiting was over
Automatically I must have run down the knoll for the next I knew I was staring at the heavens with Archie by my side
The combatants seemed to couple instinctively
Diving wheeling climbing a pair would drop out of the melee or disappear behind a cloud
Even at that height I could hear the methodical rattattat of the machineguns
Then there was a sudden flare and wisp of smoke
A plane sank turning and twisting to earth
Hun
said Archie who had his glasses on it
Almost immediately another followed
This time the pilot recovered himself while still a thousand feet from the ground and started gliding for the enemy lines
Then he wavered plunged sickeningly and fell headlong into the wood behind La Bruyere
Farther east almost over the front trenches a twoseater Albatross and a British pilot were having a desperate tussle
The bombardment had stopped and from where we stood every movement could be followed
First one then another climbed uppermost and dived back swooped out and wheeled in again so that the two planes seemed to clear each other only by inches
Then it looked as if they closed and interlocked
I expected to see both go crashing when suddenly the wings of one seemed to shrivel up and the machine dropped like a stone
Hun said Archie
That makes three
Oh good lads
Good lads
Then I saw something which took away my breath
Sloping down in wide circles came a German machine and following a little behind and a little above a British
It was the first surrender in midair I had seen
In my amazement I watched the couple right down to the ground till the enemy landed in a big meadow across the highroad and our own man in a field nearer the river
When I looked back into the sky it was bare
North south east and west there was not a sign of aircraft British or German
A violent trembling took me
Archie was sweeping the heavens with his glasses and muttering to himself
Where was the fifth man
He must have fought his way through and it was too late
But was it
From the toe of a great rolling cloudbank a flame shot earthwards followed by a Vshaped trail of smoke
British or Boche
British or Boche
I didnt wait long for an answer
For riding over the far end of the cloud came two of our fighting scouts
I tried to be cool and snapped my glasses into their case though the reaction made me want to shout
Archie turned to me with a nervous smile and a quivering mouth
I think we have won on the post he said
He reached out a hand for mine his eyes still on the sky and I was grasping it when it was torn away
He was staring upwards with a white face
We were looking at the sixth enemy plane
It had been behind the others and much lower and was making straight at a great speed for the east
The glasses showed me a different type of machine  a big machine with short wings which looked menacing as a hawk in a covey of grouse
It was under the cloudbank and above satisfied easing down after their fight and unwitting of this enemy rode the two British craft
A neighbouring antiaircraft gun broke out into a sudden burst and I thanked Heaven for its inspiration
Curious as to this new development the two British turned caught sight of the Boche and dived for him
What happened in the next minutes I cannot tell
The three seemed to be mixed up in a dog fight so that I could not distinguish friend from foe
My hands no longer trembled I was too desperate
The patter of machineguns came down to us and then one of the three broke clear and began to climb
The others strained to follow but in a second he had risen beyond their fire for he had easily the pace of them
Was it the Hun
Archies dry lips were talking
Its Lensch he said
How dyou know
I gasped angrily
Cant mistake him
Look at the way he slipped out as he banked
Thats his patent trick
In that agonizing moment hope died in me
I was perfectly calm now for the time for anxiety had gone
Farther and farther drifted the British pilots behind while Lensch in the completeness of his triumph looped more than once as if to cry an insulting farewell
In less than three minutes he would be safe inside his own lines and he carried the knowledge which for us was death
Someone was bawling in my ear and pointing upward
It was Archie and his face was wild
I looked and gasped  seized my glasses and looked again
A second before Lensch had been alone now there were two machines
I heard Archies voice
My God its the Gladas  the little Gladas
His fingers were digging into my arm and his face was against my shoulder
And then his excitement sobered into an awe which choked his speech as he stammered Its old  But I did not need him to tell me the name for I had divined it when I first saw the new plane drop from the clouds
I had that queer sense that comes sometimes to a man that a friend is present when he cannot see him
Somewhere up in the void two heroes were fighting their last battle  and one of them had a crippled leg
I had never any doubt about the result though Archie told me later that he went crazy with suspense
Lensch was not aware of his opponent till he was almost upon him and I wonder if by any freak of instinct he recognized his greatest antagonist
He never fired a shot nor did Peter 
I saw the German twist and sideslip as if to baffle the fate descending upon him
I saw Peter veer over vertically and I knew that the end had come
He was there to make certain of victory and he took the only way
The machines closed there was a crash which I felt though I could not hear it and next second both were hurtling down over and over to the earth
They fell in the river just short of the enemy lines but I did not see them for my eyes were blinded and I was on my knees
After that it was all a dream
I found myself being embraced by a French General of Division and saw the first companies of the cheerful bluecoats whom I had longed for
With them came the rain  and it was under a weeping April sky that early in the night I marched what was left of my division away from the battlefield
The enemy guns were starting to speak behind us but I did not heed them
I knew that now there were warders at the gate and I believed that by the grace of God that gate was barred for ever
They took Peter from the wreckage with scarcely a scar except his twisted leg
Death had smoothed out some of the age in him and left his face much as I remembered it long ago in the Mashonaland hills
In his pocket was his old batteredPilgrims Progress
It lies before me as I write and beside it  for I was his only legatee  the little case which came to him weeks later containing the highest honour that can be bestowed upon a soldier of Britain
It was from thePilgrims Progress that I read next morning when in the lee of an appleorchard Mary and Blenkiron and I stood in the soft spring rain beside his grave
And what I read was the tale in the end not of Mr Standfast whom he had singled out for his counterpart but of Mr ValiantforTruth whom he had not hoped to emulate
I set down the words as a salute and a farewell Then said he I am going to my Fathers and though with great difficulty I am got hither yet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am
My sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage and my courage and skill to him that can get it
My marks and scars I carry with me to be a witness for me that I have fought His battles who now will be my rewarder
So he passed over and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side
