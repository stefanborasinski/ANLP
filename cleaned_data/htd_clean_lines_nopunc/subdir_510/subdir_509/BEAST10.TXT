Children do that sort of thing successfully but children are content to convince themselves and do not vulgarise their beliefs by trying to convince other people
Leonard Bilsiters beliefs were for the few that is to say anyone who would listen to him
His dabblings in the unseen might not have carried him beyond the customary platitudes of the drawingroom visionary if accident had not reinforced his stockin trade of mystical lore
In company with a friend who was interested in a Ural mining concern he had made a trip across Eastern Europe at a moment when the great Russian railway strike was developing from a threat to a reality its outbreak caught him on the return journey somewhere on the further side of Perm and it was while waiting for a couple of days at a wayside station in a state of suspended locomotion that he made the acquaintance of a dealer in harness and metalware who profitably whiled away the tedium of the long halt by initiating his English travelling companion in a fragmentary system of folklore that he had picked up from TransBaikal traders and natives
Leonard returned to his home circle garrulous about his Russian strike experiences but oppressively reticent about certain dark mysteries which he alluded to under the resounding title of Siberian Magic
The reticence wore off in a week or two under the influence of an entire lack of general curiosity and Leonard began to make more detailed allusions to the enormous powers which this new esoteric force to use his own description of it conferred on the initiated few who knew how to wield it
His aunt Cecilia Hoops who loved sensation perhaps rather better than she loved the truth gave him as clamorous an advertisement as anyone could wish for by retailing an account of how he had turned a vegetable marrow into a wood pigeon before her very eyes
As a manifestation of the possession of supernatural powers the story was discounted in some quarters by the respect accorded to Mrs
Hoops powers of imagination
However divided opinion might be on the question of Leonards status as a wonderworker or a charlatan he certainly arrived at Mary Hamptons houseparty with a reputation for preeminence in one or other of those professions and he was not disposed to shun such publicity as might fall to his share
Esoteric forces and unusual powers figured largely in whatever conversation he or his aunt had a share in and his own performances past and potential were the subject of mysterious hints and dark avowals
I wish you would turn me into a wolf Mr Bilsiter said his hostess at luncheon the day after his arrival
My dear Mary said Colonel Hampton I never knew you had a craving in that direction
A shewolf of course continued Mrs Hampton it would be too confusing to change ones sex as well as ones species at a moments notice
I dont think one should jest on these subjects said Leonard
Im not jesting Im quite serious I assure you
Only dont do it today we have only eight available bridge players and it would break up one of our tables
Tomorrow we shall be a larger party
Tomorrow night after dinner   In our present imperfect understanding of these hidden forces I think one should approach them with humbleness rather than mockery observed Leonard with such severity that the subject was forthwith dropped
Clovis Sangrail had sat unusually silent during the discussion on the possibilities of Siberian Magic after lunch he sidetracked Lord Pabham into the comparative seclusion of the billiardroom and delivered himself of a searching question
Have you such a thing as a shewolf in your collection of wild animals
A shewolf of moderately good temper
Lord Pabham considered
There is Loiusa he said a rather fine specimen of the timberwolf
I got her two years ago in exchange for some Arctic foxes
Most of my animals get to be fairly tame before theyve been with me very long I think I can say Louisa has an angelic temper as shewolves go
Why do you ask
I was wondering whether you would lend her to me for tomorrow night said Clovis with the careless solicitude of one who borrows a collar stud or a tennis racquet
Tomorrow night
Yes wolves are nocturnal animals so the late hours wont hurt her said Clovis with the air of one who has taken everything into consideration one of your men could bring her over from Pabham Park after dusk and with a little help he ought to be able to smuggle her into the conservatory at the same moment that Mary Hampton makes an unobtrusive exit
Lord Pabham stared at Clovis for a moment in pardonable bewilderment then his face broke into a wrinkled network of laughter
Oh thats your game is it
You are going to do a little Siberian Magic on your own account
And is Mrs Hampton willing to be a fellowconspirator
Mary is pledged to see me through with it if you will guarantee Louisas temper
Ill answer for Louisa said Lord Pabham
By the following day the houseparty had swollen to larger proportions and Bilsiters instinct for self advertisement expanded duly under the stimulant of an increased audience
At dinner that evening he held forth at length on the subject of unseen forces and untested powers and his flow of impressive eloquence continued unabated while coffee was being served in the drawing room preparatory to a general migration to the cardroom
His aunt ensured a respectful hearing for his utterances but her sensationloving soul hankered after something more dramatic than mere vocal demonstration
Wont you do something to CONVINCE them of your powers Leonard
she pleaded change something into another shape
He can you know if he only chooses to she informed the company
Oh do said Mavis Pellington earnestly and her request was echoed by nearly everyone present
Even those who were not open to conviction were perfectly willing to be entertained by an exhibition of amateur conjuring
Leonard felt that something tangible was expected of him
Has anyone present he asked got a threepenny bit or some small object of no particular value 
Youre surely not going to make coins disappear or something primitive of that sort
said Clovis contemptuously
I think it very unkind of you not to carry out my suggestion of turning me into a wolf said Mary Hampton as she crossed over to the conservatory to give her macaws their usual tribute from the dessert dishes
I have already warned you of the danger of treating these powers in a mocking spirit said Leonard solemnly
I dont believe you can do it laughed Mary provocatively from the conservatory I dare you to do it if you can
I defy you to turn me into a wolf
As she said this she was lost to view behind a clump of azaleas
Mrs Hampton   began Leonard with increased solemnity but he got no further
A breath of chill air seemed to rush across the room and at the same time the macaws broke forth into earsplitting screams
What on earth is the matter with those confounded birds Mary
exclaimed Colonel Hampton at the same moment an even more piercing scream from Mavis Pellington stampeded the entire company from their seats
In various attitudes of helpless horror or instinctive defence they confronted the evillooking grey beast that was peering at them from amid a setting of fern and azalea
Mrs
Hoops was the first to recover from the general chaos of fright and bewilderment
Leonard
she screamed shrilly to her nephew turn it back into Mrs Hampton at once
It may fly at us at any moment
Turn it back
I  I dont know how to faltered Leonard who looked more scared and horrified than anyone
What
shouted Colonel Hampton youve taken the abominable liberty of turning my wife into a wolf and now you stand there calmly and say you cant turn her back again
To do strict justice to Leonard calmness was not a distinguishing feature of his attitude at the moment
I assure you I didnt turn Mrs Hampton into a wolf nothing was farther from my intentions he protested
Then where is she and how came that animal into the conservatory
demanded the Colonel
Of course we must accept your assurance that you didnt turn Mrs Hampton into a wolf said Clovis politely but you will agree that appearances are against you
Are we to have all these recriminations with that beast standing there ready to tear us to pieces
wailed Mavis indignantly
Lord Pabham you know a good deal about wild beasts   suggested Colonel Hampton
The wild beasts that I have been accustomed to said Lord Pabham have come with proper credentials from wellknown dealers or have been bred in my own menagerie
Ive never before been confronted with an animal that walks unconcernedly out of an azalea bush leaving a charming and popular hostess unaccounted for
As far as one can judge from OUTWARD characteristics he continued it has the appearance of a wellgrown female of the North American timberwolf a variety of the common species CANIS LUPUS
Oh never mind its Latin name screamed Mavis as the beast came a step or two further into the room cant you entice it away with food and shut it up where it cant do any harm
If it is really Mrs Hampton who has just had a very good dinner I dont suppose food will appeal to it very strongly said Clovis
Leonard beseeched Mrs
Hoops tearfully even if this is none of your doing cant you use your great powers to turn this dreadful beast into something harmless before it bites us all  a rabbit or something
I dont suppose Colonel Hampton would care to have his wife turned into a succession of fancy animals as though we were playing a round game with her interposed Clovis
I absolutely forbid it thundered the Colonel
Most wolves that Ive had anything to do with have been inordinately fond of sugar said Lord Pabham if you like Ill try the effect on this one
He took a piece of sugar from the saucer of his coffee cup and flung it to the expectant Louisa who snapped it in midair
There was a sigh of relief from the company a wolf that ate sugar when it might at the least have been employed in tearing macaws to pieces had already shed some of its terrors
The sigh deepened to a gasp of thanksgiving when Lord Pabham decoyed the animal out of the room by a pretended largesse of further sugar
There was an instant rush to the vacated conservatory
There was no trace of Mrs Hampton except the plate containing the macaws supper
The door is locked on the inside
exclaimed Clovis who had deftly turned the key as he affected to test it
Everyone turned towards Bilsiter
If you havent turned my wife into a wolf said Colonel Hampton will you kindly explain where she has disappeared to since she obviously could not have gone through a locked door
I will not press you for an explanation of how a North American timberwolf suddenly appeared in the conservatory but I think I have some right to inquire what has become of Mrs
Hampton
Bilsiters reiterated disclaimer was met with a general murmur of impatient disbelief
I refuse to stay another hour under this roof declared Mavis Pellington
If our hostess has really vanished out of human form said Mrs
Hoops none of the ladies of the party can very well remain
I absolutely decline to be chaperoned by a wolf
Its a shewolf said Clovis soothingly
The correct etiquette to be observed under the unusual circumstances received no further elucidation
The sudden entry of Mary Hampton deprived the discussion of its immediate interest
Some one has mesmerised me she exclaimed crossly I found myself in the game larder of all places being fed with sugar by Lord Pabham
I hate being mesmerised and the doctor has forbidden me to touch sugar
The situation was explained to her as far as it permitted of anything that could be called explanation
Then you REALLY did turn me into a wolf Mr
Bilsiter
she exclaimed excitedly
But Leonard had burned the boat in which he might now have embarked on a sea of glory
He could only shake his head feebly
It was I who took that liberty said Clovis you see I happen to have lived for a couple of years in NorthEastern Russia and I have more than a tourists acquaintance with the magic craft of that region
One does not care to speak about these strange powers but once in a way when one hears a lot of nonsense being talked about them one is tempted to show what Siberian magic can accomplish in the hands of someone who really understands it
I yielded to that temptation
May I have some brandy
the effort has left me rather faint
If Leonard Bilsiter could at that moment have transformed Clovis into a cockroach and then have stepped on him he would gladly have performed both operations
LAURA YOU are not really dying are you
asked Amanda
I have the doctors permission to live till Tuesday said Laura
But today is Saturday this is serious
gasped Amanda
I dont know about it being serious it is certainly Saturday said Laura
Death is always serious said Amanda
I never said I was going to die
I am presumably going to leave off being Laura but I shall go on being something
An animal of some kind I suppose
You see when one hasnt been very good in the life one has just lived one reincarnates in some lower organism
And I havent been very good when one comes to think of it
Ive been petty and mean and vindictive and all that sort of thing when circumstances have seemed to warrant it
Circumstances never warrant that sort of thing said Amanda hastily
If you dont mind my saying so observed Laura Egbert is a circumstance that would warrant any amount of that sort of thing
Youre married to him  thats different youve sworn to love honour and endure him I havent
I dont see whats wrong with Egbert protested Amanda
Oh I daresay the wrongness has been on my part admitted Laura dispassionately he has merely been the extenuating circumstance
He made a thin peevish kind of fuss for instance when I took the collie puppies from the farm out for a run the other day
They chased his young broods of speckled Sussex and drove two sitting hens off their nests besides running all over the flower beds
You know how devoted he is to his poultry and garden
Anyhow he neednt have gone on about it for the entire evening and then have said Lets say no more about it just when I was beginning to enjoy the discussion
Thats where one of my petty vindictive revenges came in added Laura with an unrepentant chuckle I turned the entire family of speckled Sussex into his seedling shed the day after the puppy episode
How could you
exclaimed Amanda
It came quite easy said Laura two of the hens pretended to be laying at the time but I was firm
And we thought it was an accident
You see resumed Laura I really HAVE some grounds for supposing that my next incarnation will be in a lower organism
I shall be an animal of some kind
On the other hand I havent been a bad sort in my way so I think I may count on being a nice animal something elegant and lively with a love of fun
An otter perhaps
I cant imagine you as an otter said Amanda
Well I dont suppose you can imagine me as an angel if it comes to that said Laura
Amanda was silent
She couldnt
Personally I think an otter life would be rather enjoyable continued Laura salmon to eat all the year round and the satisfaction of being able to fetch the trout in their own homes without having to wait for hours till they condescend to rise to the fly youve been dangling before them and an elegant svelte figure   Think of the otter hounds interposed Amanda how dreadful to be hunted and harried and finally worried to death
Rather fun with half the neighbourhood looking on and anyhow not worse than this SaturdaytoTuesday business of dying by inches and then I should go on into something else
If I had been a moderately good otter I suppose I should get back into human shape of some sort probably something rather primitive  a little brown unclothed Nubian boy I should think
I wish you would be serious sighed Amanda you really ought to be if youre only going to live till Tuesday
As a matter of fact Laura died on Monday
So dreadfully upsetting Amanda complained to her uncleinlaw Sir Lulworth Quayne
Ive asked quite a lot of people down for golf and fishing and the rhododendrons are just looking their best
Laura always was inconsiderate said Sir Lulworth she was born during Goodwood week with an Ambassador staying in the house who hated babies
She had the maddest kind of ideas said Amanda do you know if there was any insanity in her family
Insanity
No I never heard of any
Her father lives in West Kensington but I believe hes sane on all other subjects
She had an idea that she was going to be reincarnated as an otter said Amanda
One meets with those ideas of reincarnation so frequently even in the West said Sir Lulworth that one can hardly set them down as being mad
And Laura was such an unaccountable person in this life that I should not like to lay down definite rules as to what she might be doing in an after state
You think she really might have passed into some animal form
asked Amanda
She was one of those who shape their opinions rather readily from the standpoint of those around them
Just then Egbert entered the breakfastroom wearing an air of bereavement that Lauras demise would have been insufficient in itself to account for
Four of my speckled Sussex have been killed he exclaimed the very four that were to go to the show on Friday
One of them was dragged away and eaten right in the middle of that new carnation bed that Ive been to such trouble and expense over
My best flower bed and my best fowls singled out for destruction it almost seems as if the brute that did the deed had special knowledge how to be as devastating as possible in a short space of time
Was it a fox do you think
asked Amanda
Sounds more like a polecat said Sir Lulworth
No said Egbert there were marks of webbed feet all over the place and we followed the tracks down to the stream at the bottom of the garden evidently an otter
Amanda looked quickly and furtively across at Sir Lulworth
Egbert was too agitated to eat any breakfast and went out to superintend the strengthening of the poultry yard defences
I think she might at least have waited till the funeral was over said Amanda in a scandalised voice
Its her own funeral you know said Sir Lulworth its a nice point in etiquette how far one ought to show respect to ones own mortal remains
Disregard for mortuary convention was carried to further lengths next day during the absence of the family at the funeral ceremony the remaining survivors of the speckled Sussex were massacred
The marauders line of retreat seemed to have embraced most of the flower beds on the lawn but the strawberry beds in the lower garden had also suffered
I shall get the otter hounds to come here at the earliest possible moment said Egbert savagely
On no account
You cant dream of such a thing
exclaimed Amanda
I mean it wouldnt do so soon after a funeral in the house
Its a case of necessity said Egbert once an otter takes to that sort of thing it wont stop
Perhaps it will go elsewhere now there are no more fowls left suggested Amanda
One would think you wanted to shield the beast said Egbert
Theres been so little water in the stream lately objected Amanda it seems hardly sporting to hunt an animal when it has so little chance of taking refuge anywhere
Good gracious
fumed Egbert Im not thinking about sport
I want to have the animal killed as soon as possible
Even Amandas opposition weakened when during church time on the following Sunday the otter made its way into the house raided half a salmon from the larder and worried it into scaly fragments on the Persian rug in Egberts studio
We shall have it hiding under our beds and biting pieces out of our feet before long said Egbert and from what Amanda knew of this particular otter she felt that the possibility was not a remote one
On the evening preceding the day fixed for the hunt Amanda spent a solitary hour walking by the banks of the stream making what she imagined to be hound noises
It was charitably supposed by those who overheard her performance that she was practising for farmyard imitations at the forthcoming village entertainment
It was her friend and neighbour Aurora Burret who brought her news of the days sport
Pity you werent out we had quite a good day
We found at once in the pool just below your garden
Did you  kill
asked Amanda
Rather
A fine sheotter
Your husband got rather badly bitten in trying to tail it
Poor beast I felt quite sorry for it it had such a human look in its eyes when it was killed
Youll call me silly but do you know who the look reminded me of
My dear woman what is the matter
When Amanda had recovered to a certain extent from her attack of nervous prostration Egbert took her to the Nile Valley to recuperate
Change of scene speedily brought about the desired recovery of health and mental balance
The escapades of an adventurous otter in search of a variation of diet were viewed in their proper light
Amandas normally placid temperament reasserted itself
Even a hurricane of shouted curses coming from her husbands dressingroom in her husbands voice but hardly in his usual vocabulary failed to disturb her serenity as she made a leisurely toilet one evening in a Cairo hotel
What is the matter
What has happened
she asked in amused curiosity
The little beast has thrown all my clean shirts into the bath
Wait till I catch you you little   What little beast
asked Amanda suppressing a desire to laugh Egberts language was so hopelessly inadequate to express his outraged feelings
A little beast of a naked brown Nubian boy spluttered Egbert
And now Amanda is seriously ill
THE BOARPIG THERE is a back way on to the lawn said Mrs Philidore Stossen to her daughter through a small grass paddock and then through a walled fruit garden full of gooseberry bushes
I went all over the place last year when the family were away
There is a door that opens from the fruit garden into a shrubbery and once we emerge from there we can mingle with the guests as if we had come in by the ordinary way
Its much safer than going in by the front entrance and running the risk of coming bang up against the hostess that would be so awkward when she doesnt happen to have invited us
Isnt it a lot of trouble to take for getting admittance to a garden party
To a garden party yes to THE garden party of the season certainly not
Every one of any consequence in the county with the exception of ourselves has been asked to meet the Princess and it would be far more troublesome to invent explanations as to why we werent there than to get in by a roundabout way
I stopped Mrs Cuvering in the road yesterday and talked very pointedly about the Princess
If she didnt choose to take the hint and send me an invitation its not my fault is it
Here we are we just cut across the grass and through that little gate into the garden
Mrs Stossen and her daughter suitably arrayed for a county garden party function with an infusion of Almanack de Gotha sailed through the narrow grass paddock and the ensuing gooseberry garden with the air of state barges making an unofficial progress along a rural trout stream
There was a certain amount of furtive haste mingled with the stateliness of their advance as though hostile searchlights might be turned on them at any moment and as a matter of fact they were not unobserved
Matilda Cuvering with the alert eyes of thirteen years old and the added advantage of an exalted position in the branches of a medlar tree had enjoyed a good view of the Stossen flanking movement and had foreseen exactly where it would break down in execution
Theyll find the door locked and theyll jolly well have to go back the way they came she remarked to herself
Serves them right for not coming in by the proper entrance
What a pity Tarquin Superbus isnt loose in the paddock
After all as every one else is enjoying themselves I dont see why Tarquin shouldnt have an afternoon out
Matilda was of an age when thought is action she slid down from the branches of the medlar tree and when she clambered back again Tarquin the huge white Yorkshire boarpig had exchanged the narrow limits of his stye for the wider range of the grass paddock
The discomfited Stossen expedition returning in recriminatory but otherwise orderly retreat from the unyielding obstacle of the locked door came to a sudden halt at the gate dividing the paddock from the gooseberry garden
What a villainouslooking animal exclaimed Mrs Stossen it wasnt there when we came in
Its there now anyhow said her daughter
What on earth are we to do
I wish we had never come
The boarpig had drawn nearer to the gate for a closer inspection of the human intruders and stood champing his jaws and blinking his small red eyes in a manner that was doubtless intended to be disconcerting and as far as the Stossens were concerned thoroughly achieved that result
Shoo
Hish
Hish
Shoo
cried the ladies in chorus
If they think theyre going to drive him away by reciting lists of the kings of Israel and Judah theyre laying themselves out for disappointment observed Matilda from her seat in the medlar tree
As she made the observation aloud Mrs Stossen became for the first time aware of her presence
A moment or two earlier she would have been anything but pleased at the discovery that the garden was not as deserted as it looked but now she hailed the fact of the childs presence on the scene with absolute relief
Little girl can you find some one to drive away   she began hopefully
COMMENT
COMPRENDS PAS was the response
Oh are you French
ETES VOUS FRANCAISE
PAS DE TOUS
SUIS ANGLAISE
Then why not talk English
I want to know if   PERMETTEZMOI EXPLIQUER
You see Im rather under a cloud said Matilda
Im staying with my aunt and I was told I must behave particularly well today as lots of people were coming for a garden party and I was told to imitate Claude thats my young cousin who never does anything wrong except by accident and then is always apologetic about it
It seems they thought I ate too much raspberry trifle at lunch and they said Claude never eats too much raspberry trifle
Well Claude always goes to sleep for half an hour after lunch because hes told to and I waited till he was asleep and tied his hands and started forcible feeding with a whole bucketful of raspberry trifle that they were keeping for the gardenparty
Lots of it went on to his sailorsuit and some of it on to the bed but a good deal went down Claudes throat and they cant say again that he has never been known to eat too much raspberry trifle
That is why I am not allowed to go to the party and as an additional punishment I must speak French all the afternoon
Ive had to tell you all this in English as there were words like forcible feeding that I didnt know the French for of course I could have invented them but if I had said NOURRITURE OBLIGATOIRE you wouldnt have had the least idea what I was talking about
MAIS MAINTENANT NOUS PARLONS FRANCAIS
Oh very well TRES BIEN said Mrs Stossen reluctantly in moments of flurry such French as she knew was not under very good control
LA A LAUTRE COTE DE LA PORTE EST UN COCHON   UN COCHON
AH LE PETIT CHARMANT
exclaimed Matilda with enthusiasm
MAIS NON PAS DU TOUT PETIT ET PAS DU TOUT CHARMANT UN BETE FEROCE   UNE BETE corrected Matilda a pig is masculine as long as you call it a pig but if you lose your temper with it and call it a ferocious beast it becomes one of us at once
French is a dreadfully unsexing language
For goodness sake let us talk English then said Mrs Stossen
Is there any way out of this garden except through the paddock where the pig is
I always go over the wall by way of the plum tree said Matilda
Dressed as we are we could hardly do that said Mrs Stossen it was difficult to imagine her doing it in any costume
Do you think you could go and get some one who would drive the pig away
asked Miss Stossen
I promised my aunt I would stay here till five oclock its not four yet
I am sure under the circumstances your aunt would permit   My conscience would not permit said Matilda with cold dignity
We cant stay here till five oclock exclaimed Mrs Stossen with growing exasperation
Shall I recite to you to make the time pass quicker
asked Matilda obligingly 
Belinda the little Breadwinner is considered my best piece or perhaps it ought to be something in French
Henri Quatres address to his soldiers is the only thing I really know in that language
If you will go and fetch some one to drive that animal away I will give you something to buy yourself a nice present said Mrs Stossen
Matilda came several inches lower down the medlar tree
That is the most practical suggestion you have made yet for getting out of the garden she remarked cheerfully Claude and I are collecting money for the Childrens Fresh Air Fund and we are seeing which of us can collect the biggest sum
I shall be very glad to contribute half a crown very glad indeed said Mrs Stossen digging that coin out of the depths of a receptacle which formed a detached outwork of her toilet
Claude is a long way ahead of me at present continued Matilda taking no notice of the suggested offering you see hes only eleven and has golden hair and those are enormous advantages when youre on the collecting job
Only the other day a Russian lady gave him ten shillings
Russians understand the art of giving far better than we do
I expect Claude will net quite twentyfive shillings this afternoon hell have the field to himself and hell be able to do the pale fragile notlongforthisworld business to perfection after his raspberry trifle experience
Yes hell be QUITE two pounds ahead of me by now
With much probing and plucking and many regretful murmurs the beleaguered ladies managed to produce seven andsixpence between them
I am afraid this is all weve got said Mrs Stossen
Matilda showed no sign of coming down either to the earth or to their figure
I could not do violence to my conscience for anything less than ten shillings she announced stiffly
Mother and daughter muttered certain remarks under their breath in which the word beast was prominent and probably had no reference to Tarquin
I find I HAVE got another halfcrown said Mrs Stossen in a shaking voice here you are
Now please fetch some one quickly
Matilda slipped down from the tree took possession of the donation and proceeded to pick up a handful of overripe medlars from the grass at her feet
Then she climbed over the gate and addressed herself affectionately to the boarpig
Come Tarquin dear old boy you know you cant resist medlars when theyre rotten and squashy
Tarquin couldnt
By dint of throwing the fruit in front of him at judicious intervals Matilda decoyed him back to his stye while the delivered captives hurried across the paddock
Well I never
The little minx
exclaimed Mrs Stossen when she was safely on the high road
The animal wasnt savage at all and as for the ten shillings I dont believe the Fresh Air Fund will see a penny of it
There she was unwarrantably harsh in her judgment
If you examine the books of the fund you will find the acknowledgment Collected by Miss Matilda Cuvering 2s

THE BROGUE THE hunting season had come to an end and the Mullets had not succeeded in selling the Brogue
There had been a kind of tradition in the family for the past three or four years a sort of fatalistic hope that the Brogue would find a purchaser before the hunting was over but seasons came and went without anything happening to justify such illfounded optimism
The animal had been named Berserker in the earlier stages of its career it had been rechristened the Brogue later on in recognition of the fact that once acquired it was extremely difficult to get rid of
The unkinder wits of the neighbourhood had been known to suggest that the first letter of its name was superfluous
The Brogue had been variously described in sale catalogues as a light weight hunter a ladys hack and more simply but still with a touch of imagination as a useful brown gelding standing 151
Toby Mullet had ridden him for four seasons with the West Wessex you can ride almost any sort of horse with the West Wessex as long as it is an animal that knows the country
The Brogue knew the country intimately having personally created most of the gaps that were to be met with in banks and hedges for many miles round
His manners and characteristics were not ideal in the hunting field but he was probably rather safer to ride to hounds than he was as a hack on country roads
According to the Mullet family he was not really roadshy but there were one or two objects of dislike that brought on sudden attacks of what Toby called the swerving sickness
Motors and cycles he treated with tolerant disregard but pigs wheelbarrows piles of stones by the roadside perambulators in a village street gates painted too aggressively white and sometimes but not always the newer kind of beehives turned him aside from his tracks in vivid imitation of the zigzag course of forked lightning
If a pheasant rose noisily from the other side of a hedgerow the Brogue would spring into the air at the same moment but this may have been due to a desire to be companionable
The Mullet family contradicted the widely prevalent report that the horse was a confirmed cribbiter
It was about the third week in May that Mrs Mullet relict of the late Sylvester Mullet and mother of Toby and a bunch of daughters assailed Clovis Sangrail on the outskirts of the village with a breathless catalogue of local happenings
You know our new neighbour Mr
Penricarde
she vociferated awfully rich owns tin mines in Cornwall middleaged and rather quiet
Hes taken the Red House on a long lease and spent a lot of money on alterations and improvements
Well Tobys sold him the Brogue
Clovis spent a moment or two in assimilating the astonishing news then he broke out into unstinted congratulation
If he had belonged to a more emotional race he would probably have kissed Mrs Mullet
How wonderfully lucky to have pulled it off at last
Now you can buy a decent animal
Ive always said that Toby was clever
Ever so many congratulations
Dont congratulate me
Its the most unfortunate thing that could have happened
said Mrs Mullet dramatically
Clovis stared at her in amazement
Mr Penricarde said Mrs Mullet sinking her voice to what she imagined to be an impressive whisper though it rather resembled a hoarse excited squeak Mr Penricarde has just begun to pay attentions to Jessie
Slight at first but now unmistakable
I was a fool not to have seen it sooner
Yesterday at the Rectory garden party he asked her what her favourite flowers were and she told him carnations and today a whole stack of carnations has arrived clove and malmaison and lovely dark red ones regular exhibition blooms and a box of chocolates that he must have got on purpose from London
And hes asked her to go round the links with him to morrow
And now just at this critical moment Toby has sold him that animal
Its a calamity
But youve been trying to get the horse off your hands for years said Clovis
Ive got a houseful of daughters said Mrs Mullet and Ive been trying  well not to get them off my hands of course but a husband or two wouldnt be amiss among the lot of them there are six of them you know
I dont know said Clovis Ive never counted but I expect youre right as to the number mothers generally know these things
And now continued Mrs Mullet in her tragic whisper when theres a rich husbandinprospect imminent on the horizon Toby goes and sells him that miserable animal
It will probably kill him if he tries to ride it anyway it will kill any affection he might have felt towards any member of our family
What is to be done
We cant very well ask to have the horse back you see we praised it up like anything when we thought there was a chance of his buying it and said it was just the animal to suit him
Couldnt you steal it out of his stable and send it to grass at some farm miles away
suggested Clovis write Votes for Women on the stable door and the thing would pass for a Suffragette outrage
No one who knew the horse could possibly suspect you of wanting to get it back again
Every newspaper in the country would ring with the affair said Mrs Mullet cant you imagine the headline Valuable Hunter Stolen by Suffragettes
The police would scour the countryside till they found the animal
Well Jessie must try and get it back from Penricarde on the plea that its an old favourite
She can say it was only sold because the stable had to be pulled down under the terms of an old repairing lease and that now it has been arranged that the stable is to stand for a couple of years longer
It sounds a queer proceeding to ask for a horse back when youve just sold him said Mrs Mullet but something must be done and done at once
The man is not used to horses and I believe I told him it was as quiet as a lamb
After all lambs go kicking and twisting about as if they were demented dont they
The lamb has an entirely unmerited character for sedateness agreed Clovis
Jessie came back from the golf links next day in a state of mingled elation and concern
Its all right about the proposal she announced he came out with it at the sixth hole
I said I must have time to think it over
I accepted him at the seventh
My dear said her mother I think a little more maidenly reserve and hesitation would have been advisable as youve known him so short a time
You might have waited till the ninth hole
The seventh is a very long hole said Jessie besides the tension was putting us both off our game
By the time wed got to the ninth hole wed settled lots of things
The honeymoon is to be spent in Corsica with perhaps a flying visit to Naples if we feel like it and a week in London to wind up with
Two of his nieces are to be asked to be bridesmaids so with our lot there will be seven which is rather a lucky number
You are to wear your pearl grey with any amount of Honiton lace jabbed into it
By the way hes coming over this evening to ask your consent to the whole affair
So far alls well but about the Brogue its a different matter
I told him the legend about the stable and how keen we were about buying the horse back but he seems equally keen on keeping it
He said he must have horse exercise now that hes living in the country and hes going to start riding tomorrow
Hes ridden a few times in the Row on an animal that was accustomed to carry octogenarians and people undergoing rest cures and thats about all his experience in the saddle  oh and he rode a pony once in Norfolk when he was fifteen and the pony twentyfour and tomorrow hes going to ride the Brogue
I shall be a widow before Im married and I do so want to see what Corsicas like it looks so silly on the map
Clovis was sent for in haste and the developments of the situation put before him
Nobody can ride that animal with any safety said Mrs Mullet except Toby and he knows by long experience what it is going to shy at and manages to swerve at the same time
I did hint to Mr Penricarde  to Vincent I should say  that the Brogue didnt like white gates said Jessie
White gates
exclaimed Mrs Mullet did you mention what effect a pig has on him
Hell have to go past Lockyers farm to get to the high road and theres sure to be a pig or two grunting about in the lane
Hes taken rather a dislike to turkeys lately said Toby
Its obvious that Penricarde mustnt be allowed to go out on that animal said Clovis at least not till Jessie has married him and tired of him
I tell you what ask him to a picnic tomorrow starting at an early hour hes not the sort to go out for a ride before breakfast
The day after Ill get the rector to drive him over to Crowleigh before lunch to see the new cottage hospital theyre building there
The Brogue will be standing idle in the stable and Toby can offer to exercise it then it can pick up a stone or something of the sort and go conveniently lame
If you hurry on the wedding a bit the lameness fiction can be kept up till the ceremony is safely over
Mrs Mullet belonged to an emotional race and she kissed Clovis
It was nobodys fault that the rain came down in torrents the next morning making a picnic a fantastic impossibility
It was also nobodys fault but sheer illluck that the weather cleared up sufficiently in the afternoon to tempt Mr Penricarde to make his first essay with the Brogue
They did not get as far as the pigs at Lockyers farm the rectory gate was painted a dull unobtrusive green but it had been white a year or two ago and the Brogue never forgot that he had been in the habit of making a violent curtsey a backpedal and a swerve at this particular point of the road
Subsequently there being apparently no further call on his services he broke his way into the rectory orchard where he found a hen turkey in a coop later visitors to the orchard found the coop almost intact but very little left of the turkey
Mr Penricarde a little stunned and shaken and suffering from a bruised knee and some minor damages goodnaturedly ascribed the accident to his own inexperience with horses and country roads and allowed Jessie to nurse him back into complete recovery and golf fitness within something less than a week
In the list of wedding presents which the local newspaper published a fortnight or so later appeared the following item Brown saddlehorse The Brogue bridegrooms gift to bride
Which shows said Toby Mullet that he knew nothing
Or else said Clovis that he has a very pleasing wit
THE HEN DORA BITTHOLZ is coming on Thursday said Mrs Sangrail
This next Thursday 
asked Clovis His mother nodded
Youve rather done it havent you
he chuckled Jane Martlet has only been here five days and she never stays less than a fortnight even when shes asked definitely for a week
Youll never get her out of the house by Thursday
Why should I
asked Mrs Sangrail she and Dora are good friends arent they
They used to be as far as I remember
They used to be thats what makes them all the more bitter now
Each feels that she has nursed a viper in her bosom
Nothing fans the flame of human resentment so much as the discovery that ones bosom has been utilised as a snake sanatorium
But what has happened
Has some one been making mischief
Not exactly said Clovis a hen came between them
A hen
What hen
It was a bronze Leghorn or some such exotic breed and Dora sold it to Jane at a rather exotic price
They both go in for prize poultry you know and Jane thought she was going to get her money back in a large family of pedigree chickens
The bird turned out to be an abstainer from the egg habit and Im told that the letters which passed between the two women were a revelation as to how much invective could be got on to a sheet of notepaper
How ridiculous
said Mrs Sangrail
Couldnt some of their friends compose the quarrel
People tried said Clovis but it must have been rather like composing the storm music of the Fliegende Hollander
Jane was willing to take back some of her most libellous remarks if Dora would take back the hen but Dora said that would be owning herself in the wrong and you know shed as soon think of owning slum property in Whitechapel as do that
Its a most awkward situation said Mrs Sangrail
Do you suppose they wont speak to one another
On the contrary the difficulty will be to get them to leave off
Their remarks on each others conduct and character have hitherto been governed by the fact that only four ounces of plain speaking can be sent through the post for a penny
I cant put Dora off said Mrs Sangrail
Ive already postponed her visit once and nothing short of a miracle would make Jane leave before her selfallotted fortnight is over
Miracles are rather in my line said Clovis
I dont pretend to be very hopeful in this case but Ill do my best
As long as you dont drag me into it   stipulated his mother
    Servants are a bit of a nuisance muttered Clovis as he sat in the smokingroom after lunch talking fitfully to Jane Martlet in the intervals of putting together the materials of a cocktail which he had irreverently patented under the name of an Ella Wheeler Wilcox
It was partly compounded of old brandy and partly of curacoa there were other ingredients but they were never indiscriminately revealed
Servants a nuisance
exclaimed Jane bounding into the topic with the exuberant plunge of a hunter when it leaves the high road and feels turf under its hoofs I should think they were
The trouble Ive had in getting suited this year you would hardly believe
But I dont see what you have to complain of  your mother is so wonderfully lucky in her servants
Sturridge for instance  hes been with you for years and Im sure hes a paragon as butlers go
Thats just the trouble said Clovis
Its when servants have been with you for years that they become a really serious nuisance
The here today and gone to morrow sort dont matter  youve simply got to replace them its the stayers and the paragons that are the real worry
But if they give satisfaction   That doesnt prevent them from giving trouble
Now youve mentioned Sturridge  it was Sturridge I was particularly thinking of when I made the observation about servants being a nuisance
The excellent Sturridge a nuisance
I cant believe it
I know hes excellent and we just couldnt get along without him hes the one reliable element in this rather haphazard household
But his very orderliness has had an effect on him
Have you ever considered what it must be like to go on unceasingly doing the correct thing in the correct manner in the same surroundings for the greater part of a lifetime
To know and ordain and superintend exactly what silver and glass and table linen shall be used and set out on what occasions to have cellar and pantry and platecupboard under a minutely devised and undeviating administration to be noiseless impalpable omnipresent and as far as your own department is concerned omniscient
I should go mad said Jane with conviction
Exactly said Clovis thoughtfully swallowing his completed Ella Wheeler Wilcox
But Sturridge hasnt gone mad said Jane with a flutter of inquiry in her voice
On most points hes thoroughly sane and reliable said Clovis but at times he is subject to the most obstinate delusions and on those occasions he becomes not merely a nuisance but a decided embarrassment
What sort of delusions
Unfortunately they usually centre round one of the guests of the house party and that is where the awkwardness comes in
For instance he took it into his head that Matilda Sheringham was the Prophet Elijah and as all that he remembered about Elijahs history was the episode of the ravens in the wilderness he absolutely declined to interfere with what he imagined to be Matildas private catering arrangements wouldnt allow any tea to be sent up to her in the morning and if he was waiting at table he passed her over altogether in handing round the dishes
How very unpleasant
Whatever did you do about it
Oh Matilda got fed after a fashion but it was judged to be best for her to cut her visit short
It was really the only thing to be done said Clovis with some emphasis
I shouldnt have done that said Jane I should have humoured him in some way
I certainly shouldnt have gone away
Clovis frowned
It is not always wise to humour people when they get these ideas into their heads
Theres no knowing to what lengths they may go if you encourage them
You dont mean to say he might be dangerous do you
asked Jane with some anxiety
One can never be certain said Clovis now and then he gets some idea about a guest which might take an unfortunate turn
That is precisely what is worrying me at the present moment
What has he taken a fancy about some one here now
asked Jane excitedly how thrilling
Do tell me who it is
You said Clovis briefly
Me
Clovis nodded
Who on earth does he think I am
Queen Anne was the unexpected answer
Queen Anne
What an idea
But anyhow theres nothing dangerous about her shes such a colourless personality
What does posterity chiefly say about Queen Anne
asked Clovis rather sternly
The only thing that I can remember about her said Jane is the saying Queen Annes dead
Exactly said Clovis staring at the glass that had held the Ella Wheeler Wilcox dead
Do you mean he takes me for the ghost of Queen Anne
asked Jane
Ghost
Dear no
No one ever heard of a ghost that came down to breakfast and ate kidneys and toast and honey with a healthy appetite
No its the fact of you being so very much alive and flourishing that perplexes and annoys him
All his life he has been accustomed to look on Queen Anne as the personification of everything that is dead and done with as dead as Queen Anne you know and now he has to fill your glass at lunch and dinner and listen to your accounts of the gay time you had at the Dublin Horse Show and naturally he feels that somethings very wrong with you
But he wouldnt be downright hostile to me on that account would he
Jane asked anxiously
I didnt get really alarmed about it till lunch to day said Clovis I caught him glowering at you with a very sinister look and muttering Ought to be dead long ago she ought and some one should see to it
Thats why I mentioned the matter to you
This is awful said Jane your mother must be told about it at once
My mother mustnt hear a word about it said Clovis earnestly it would upset her dreadfully
She relies on Sturridge for everything
But he might kill me at any moment protested Jane
Not at any moment hes busy with the silver all the afternoon
Youll have to keep a sharp lookout all the time and be on your guard to frustrate any murderous attack said Jane adding in a tone of weak obstinacy Its a dreadful situation to be in with a mad butler dangling over you like the sword of Whatshisname but Im certainly not going to cut my visit short
Clovis swore horribly under his breath the miracle was an obvious misfire
It was in the hall the next morning after a late breakfast that Clovis had his final inspiration as he stood engaged in coaxing rust spots from an old putter
Where is Miss Martlet
he asked the butler who was at that moment crossing the hall
Writing letters in the morningroom sir said Sturridge announcing a fact of which his questioner was already aware
She wants to copy the inscription on that old baskethilted sabre said Clovis pointing to a venerable weapon hanging on the wall
I wish youd take it to her my hands are all over oil
Take it without the sheath it will be less trouble
The butler drew the blade still keen and bright in its wellcared for old age and carried it into the morningroom
There was a door near the writingtable leading to a back stairway Jane vanished through it with such lightning rapidity that the butler doubted whether she had seen him come in
Half an hour later Clovis was driving her and her hastilypacked luggage to the station
Mother will be awfully vexed when she comes back from her ride and finds you have gone he observed to the departing guest but Ill make up some story about an urgent wire having called you away
It wouldnt do to alarm her unnecessarily about Sturridge
Jane sniffed slightly at Clovis ideas of unnecessary alarm and was almost rude to the young man who came round with thoughtful inquiries as to luncheon baskets
The miracle lost some of its usefulness from the fact that Dora wrote the same day postponing the date of her visit but at any rate Clovis holds the record as the only human being who ever hustled Jane Martlet out of the timetable of her migrations
THE OPEN WINDOW MY aunt will be down presently Mr Nuttel said a very selfpossessed young lady of fifteen in the meantime you must try and put up with me
Framton Nuttel endeavoured to say the correct something which should duly flatter the niece of the moment without unduly discounting the aunt that was to come
Privately he doubted more than ever whether these formal visits on a succession of total strangers would do much towards helping the nerve cure which he was supposed to be undergoing
I know how it will be his sister had said when he was preparing to migrate to this rural retreat you will bury yourself down there and not speak to a living soul and your nerves will be worse than ever from moping
I shall just give you letters of introduction to all the people I know there
Some of them as far as I can remember were quite nice
Framton wondered whether Mrs Sappleton the lady to whom he was presenting one of the letters of introduction came into the nice division
Do you know many of the people round here
asked the niece when she judged that they had had sufficient silent communion
Hardly a soul said Framton
My sister was staying here at the rectory you know some four years ago and she gave me letters of introduction to some of the people here
He made the last statement in a tone of distinct regret
Then you know practically nothing about my aunt
pursued the selfpossessed young lady
Only her name and address admitted the caller
He was wondering whether Mrs Sappleton was in the married or widowed state
An undefinable something about the room seemed to suggest masculine habitation
Her great tragedy happened just three years ago said the child that would be since your sisters time
Her tragedy
asked Framton somehow in this restful country spot tragedies seemed out of place
You may wonder why we keep that window wide open on an October afternoon said the niece indicating a large French window that opened on to a lawn
It is quite warm for the time of the year said Framton but has that window got anything to do with the tragedy
Out through that window three years ago to a day her husband and her two young brothers went off for their days shooting
They never came back
In crossing the moor to their favourite snipeshooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog
It had been that dreadful wet summer you know and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning
Their bodies were never recovered
That was the dreadful part of it
Here the childs voice lost its selfpossessed note and became falteringly human
Poor aunt always thinks that they will come back some day they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them and walk in at that window just as they used to do
That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk
Poor dear aunt she has often told me how they went out her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm and Ronnie her youngest brother singing Bertie why do you bound
as he always did to tease her because she said it got on her nerves
Do you know sometimes on still quiet evenings like this I almost get a creepy feeling that they will all walk in through that window   She broke off with a little shudder
It was a relief to Framton when the aunt bustled into the room with a whirl of apologies for being late in making her appearance
I hope Vera has been amusing you
she said
She has been very interesting said Framton
I hope you dont mind the open window said Mrs Sappleton briskly my husband and brothers will be home directly from shooting and they always come in this way
Theyve been out for snipe in the marshes today so theyll make a fine mess over my poor carpets
So like you menfolk isnt it
She rattled on cheerfully about the shooting and the scarcity of birds and the prospects for duck in the winter
To Framton it was all purely horrible
He made a desperate but only partially successful effort to turn the talk on to a less ghastly topic he was conscious that his hostess was giving him only a fragment of her attention and her eyes were constantly straying past him to the open window and the lawn beyond
It was certainly an unfortunate coincidence that he should have paid his visit on this tragic anniversary
The doctors agree in ordering me complete rest an absence of mental excitement and avoidance of anything in the nature of violent physical exercise announced Framton who laboured under the tolerably widespread delusion that total strangers and chance acquaintances are hungry for the least detail of ones ailments and infirmities their cause and cure
On the matter of diet they are not so much in agreement he continued
No
said Mrs Sappleton in a voice which only replaced a yawn at the last moment
Then she suddenly brightened into alert attention  but not to what Framton was saying
Here they are at last
she cried
Just in time for tea and dont they look as if they were muddy up to the eyes
Framton shivered slightly and turned towards the niece with a look intended to convey sympathetic comprehension
The child was staring out through the open window with dazed horror in her eyes
In a chill shock of nameless fear Framton swung round in his seat and looked in the same direction
In the deepening twilight three figures were walking across the lawn towards the window they all carried guns under their arms and one of them was additionally burdened with a white coat hung over his shoulders
A tired brown spaniel kept close at their heels
Noiselessly they neared the house and then a hoarse young voice chanted out of the dusk I said Bertie why do you bound
Framton grabbed wildly at his stick and hat the halldoor the graveldrive and the front gate were dimlynoted stages in his headlong retreat
A cyclist coming along the road had to run into the hedge to avoid an imminent collision
Here we are my dear said the bearer of the white mackintosh coming in through the window fairly muddy but most of its dry
Who was that who bolted out as we came up
A most extraordinary man a Mr Nuttel said Mrs Sappleton could only talk about his illnesses and dashed off without a word of goodbye or apology when you arrived
One would think he had seen a ghost
I expect it was the spaniel said the niece calmly he told me he had a horror of dogs
He was once hunted into a cemetery somewhere on the banks of the Ganges by a pack of pariah dogs and had to spend the night in a newly dug grave with the creatures snarling and grinning and foaming just above him
Enough to make anyone their nerve
Romance at short notice was her speciality
THE TREASURE SHIP THE great galleon lay in semiretirement under the sand and weed and water of the northern bay where the fortune of war and weather had long ago ensconced it
Three and a quarter centuries had passed since the day when it had taken the high seas as an important unit of a fighting squadron  precisely which squadron the learned were not agreed
The galleon had brought nothing into the world but it had according to tradition and report taken much out of it
But how much
There again the learned were in disagreement
Some were as generous in their estimate as an incometax assessor others applied a species of higher criticism to the submerged treasure chests and debased their contents to the currency of goblin gold
Of the former school was Lulu Duchess of Dulverton
The Duchess was not only a believer in the existence of a sunken treasure of alluring proportions she also believed that she knew of a method by which the said treasure might be precisely located and cheaply disembedded
An aunt on her mothers side of the family had been Maid of Honour at the Court of Monaco and had taken a respectful interest in the deepsea researches in which the Throne of that country impatient perhaps of its terrestrial restrictions was wont to immerse itself
It was through the instrumentality of this relative that the Duchess learned of an invention perfected and very nearly patented by a Monegaskan savant by means of which the homelife of the Mediterranean sardine might be studied at a depth of many fathoms in a cold white light of more than ballroom brilliancy
Implicated in this invention and in the Duchesss eyes the most attractive part of it was an electric suction dredge specially designed for dragging to the surface such objects of interest and value as might be found in the more accessible levels of the oceanbed
The rights of the invention were to be acquired for a matter of eighteen hundred francs and the apparatus for a few thousand more
The Duchess of Dulverton was rich as the world counted wealth she nursed the hope of being one day rich at her own computation
Companies had been formed and efforts had been made again and again during the course of three centuries to probe for the alleged treasures of the interesting galleon with the aid of this invention she considered that she might go to work on the wreck privately and independently
After all one of her ancestors on her mothers side was descended from Medina Sidonia so she was of opinion that she had as much right to the treasure as anyone
She acquired the invention and bought the apparatus
Among other family ties and encumbrances Lulu possessed a nephew Vasco Honiton a young gentleman who was blessed with a small income and a large circle of relatives and lived impartially and precariously on both
The name Vasco had been given him possibly in the hope that he might live up to its adventurous tradition but he limited himself strictly to the home industry of adventurer preferring to exploit the assured rather than to explore the unknown
Lulus intercourse with him had been restricted of recent years to the negative processes of being out of town when he called on her and short of money when he wrote to her
Now however she bethought herself of his eminent suitability for the direction of a treasureseeking experiment if anyone could extract gold from an unpromising situation it would certainly be Vasco  of course under the necessary safeguards in the way of supervision
Where money was in question Vascos conscience was liable to fits of obstinate silence
Somewhere on the west coast of Ireland the Dulverton property included a few acres of shingle rock and heather too barren to support even an agrarian outrage but embracing a small and fairly deep bay where the lobster yield was good in most seasons
There was a bleak little house on the property and for those who liked lobsters and solitude and were able to accept an Irish cooks ideas as to what might be perpetrated in the name of mayonnaise Innisgluther was a tolerable exile during the summer months
Lulu seldom went there herself but she lent the house lavishly to friends and relations
She put it now at Vascos disposal
It will be the very place to practise and experiment with the salvage apparatus she said the bay is quite deep in places and you will be able to test everything thoroughly before starting on the treasure hunt
In less than three weeks Vasco turned up in town to report progress
The apparatus works beautifully he informed his aunt the deeper one got the clearer everything grew
We found something in the way of a sunken wreck to operate on too
A wreck in Innisgluther Bay
exclaimed Lulu
A submerged motorboat the SUBROSA said Vasco
No
really
said Lulu poor Billy Yuttleys boat
I remember it went down somewhere off that coast some three years ago
His body was washed ashore at the Point
People said at the time that the boat was capsized intentionally  a case of suicide you know
People always say that sort of thing when anything tragic happens
In this case they were right said Vasco
What do you mean
asked the Duchess hurriedly
What makes you think so
I know said Vasco simply
Know
How can you know
How can anyone know
The thing happened three years ago
In a locker of the SUBROSA I found a watertight strongbox
It contained papers
Vasco paused with dramatic effect and searched for a moment in the inner breastpocket of his coat
He drew out a folded slip of paper
The Duchess snatched at it in almost indecent haste and moved appreciably nearer the fireplace
Was this in the SUBROSAS strongbox
she asked
Oh no said Vasco carelessly that is a list of the wellknown people who would be involved in a very disagreeable scandal if the SUBROSAS papers were made public
Ive put you at the head of it otherwise it follows alphabetical order
The Duchess gazed helplessly at the string of names which seemed for the moment to include nearly every one she knew
As a matter of fact her own name at the head of the list exercised an almost paralysing effect on her thinking faculties
Of course you have destroyed the papers
she asked when she had somewhat recovered herself
She was conscious that she made the remark with an entire lack of conviction
Vasco shook his head
But you should have said Lulu angrily if as you say they are highly compromising   Oh they are I assure you of that interposed the young man
Then you should put them out of harms way at once
Supposing anything should leak out think of all these poor unfortunate people who would be involved in the disclosures and Lulu tapped the list with an agitated gesture
Unfortunate perhaps but not poor corrected Vasco if you read the list carefully youll notice that I havent troubled to include anyone whose financial standing isnt above question
Lulu glared at her nephew for some moments in silence
Then she asked hoarsely What are you going to do
Nothing  for the remainder of my life he answered meaningly
A little hunting perhaps he continued and I shall have a villa at Florence
The Villa SubRosa would sound rather quaint and picturesque dont you think and quite a lot of people would be able to attach a meaning to the name
And I suppose I must have a hobby I shall probably collect Raeburns
Lulus relative who lived at the Court of Monaco got quite a snappish answer when she wrote recommending some further invention in the realm of marine research
THE COBWEB THE farmhouse kitchen probably stood where it did as a matter of accident or haphazard choice yet its situation might have been planned by a masterstrategist in farmhouse architecture
Dairy and poultryyard and herb garden and all the busy places of the farm seemed to lead by easy access into its wide flagged haven where there was room for everything and where muddy boots left traces that were easily swept away
And yet for all that it stood so well in the centre of human bustle its long latticed window with the wide windowseat built into an embrasure beyond the huge fireplace looked out on a wild spreading view of hill and heather and wooded combe
The window nook made almost a little room in itself quite the pleasantest room in the farm as far as situation and capabilities went
Young Mrs Ladbruk whose husband had just come into the farm by way of inheritance cast covetous eyes on this snug corner and her fingers itched to make it bright and cosy with chintz curtains and bowls of flowers and a shelf or two of old china
The musty farm parlour looking out on to a prim cheerless garden imprisoned within high blank walls was not a room that lent itself readily either to comfort or decoration
When we are more settled I shall work wonders in the way of making the kitchen habitable said the young woman to her occasional visitors
There was an unspoken wish in those words a wish which was unconfessed as well as unspoken
Emma Ladbruk was the mistress of the farm jointly with her husband she might have her say and to a certain extent her way in ordering its affairs
But she was not mistress of the kitchen
On one of the shelves of an old dresser in company with chipped sauceboats pewter jugs cheesegraters and paid bills rested a worn and ragged Bible on whose front page was the record in faded ink of a baptism dated ninetyfour years ago
Martha Crale was the name written on that yellow page
The yellow wrinkled old dame who hobbled and muttered about the kitchen looking like a dead autumn leaf which the winter winds still pushed hither and thither had once been Martha Crale for seventy odd years she had been Martha Mountjoy
For longer than anyone could remember she had pattered to and fro between oven and washhouse and dairy and out to chickenrun and garden grumbling and muttering and scolding but working unceasingly
Emma Ladbruk of whose coming she took as little notice as she would of a bee wandering in at a window on a summers day used at first to watch her with a kind of frightened curiosity
She was so old and so much a part of the place it was difficult to think of her exactly as a living thing
Old Shep the whitenozzled stifflimbed collie waiting for his time to die seemed almost more human than the withered driedup old woman
He had been a riotous roystering puppy mad with the joy of life when she was already a tottering hobbling dame now he was just a blind breathing carcase nothing more and she still worked with frail energy still swept and baked and washed fetched and carried
If there were something in these wise old dogs that did not perish utterly with death Emma used to think to herself what generations of ghostdogs there must be out on those hills that Martha had reared and fed and tended and spoken a last goodbye word to in that old kitchen
And what memories she must have of human generations that had passed away in her time
It was difficult for anyone let alone a stranger like Emma to get her to talk of the days that had been her shrill quavering speech was of doors that had been left unfastened pails that had got mislaid calves whose feedingtime was overdue and the various little faults and lapses that chequer a farmhouse routine
Now and again when election time came round she would unstore her recollections of the old names round which the fight had waged in the days gone by
There had been a Palmerston that had been a name down Tiverton way Tiverton was not a far journey as the crow flies but to Martha it was almost a foreign country
Later there had been Northcotes and Aclands and many other newer names that she had forgotten the names changed but it was always Libruls and Toories Yellows and Blues
And they always quarrelled and shouted as to who was right and who was wrong
The one they quarrelled about most was a fine old gentleman with an angry face  she had seen his picture on the walls
She had seen it on the floor too with a rotten apple squashed over it for the farm had changed its politics from time to time
Martha had never been on one side or the other none of they had ever done the farm a stroke of good
Such was her sweeping verdict given with all a peasants distrust of the outside world
When the halffrightened curiosity had somewhat faded away Emma Ladbruk was uncomfortably conscious of another feeling towards the old woman
She was a quaint old tradition lingering about the place she was part and parcel of the farm itself she was something at once pathetic and picturesque  but she was dreadfully in the way
Emma had come to the farm full of plans for little reforms and improvements in part the result of training in the newest ways and methods in part the outcome of her own ideas and fancies
Reforms in the kitchen region if those deaf old ears could have been induced to give them even a hearing would have met with short shrift and scornful rejection and the kitchen region spread over the zone of dairy and market business and half the work of the household
Emma with the latest science of deadpoultry dressing at her fingertips sat by an unheeded watcher while old Martha trussed the chickens for the marketstall as she had trussed them for nearly fourscore years  all leg and no breast
And the hundred hints anent effective cleaning and labour lightening and the things that make for wholesomeness which the young woman was ready to impart or to put into action dropped away into nothingness before that wan muttering unheeding presence
Above all the coveted window corner that was to be a dainty cheerful oasis in the gaunt old kitchen stood now choked and lumbered with a litter of odds and ends that Emma for all her nominal authority would not have dared or cared to displace over them seemed to be spun the protection of something that was like a human cobweb
Decidedly Martha was in the way
It would have been an unworthy meanness to have wished to see the span of that brave old life shortened by a few paltry months but as the days sped by Emma was conscious that the wish was there disowned though it might be lurking at the back of her mind
She felt the meanness of the wish come over her with a qualm of selfreproach one day when she came into the kitchen and found an unaccustomed state of things in that usually busy quarter
Old Martha was not working
A basket of corn was on the floor by her side and out in the yard the poultry were beginning to clamour a protest of overdue feedingtime
But Martha sat huddled in a shrunken bunch on the window seat looking out with her dim old eyes as though she saw something stranger than the autumn landscape
Is anything the matter Martha
asked the young woman
Tis death tis death acoming answered the quavering voice I knew twere coming
I knew it
Twerent for nothing that old Sheps been howling all morning
An last night I heard the screechowl give the deathcry and there were something white as run across the yard yesterday twerent a cat nor a stoat twere something
The fowls knew twere something they all drew off to one side
Ay theres been warnings
I knew it were acoming
The young womans eyes clouded with pity
The old thing sitting there so white and shrunken had once been a merry noisy child playing about in lanes and haylofts and farmhouse garrets that had been eighty odd years ago and now she was just a frail old body cowering under the approaching chill of the death that was coming at last to take her
It was not probable that much could be done for her but Emma hastened away to get assistance and counsel
Her husband she knew was down at a tree felling some little distance off but she might find some other intelligent soul who knew the old woman better than she did
The farm she soon found out had that faculty common to farmyards of swallowing up and losing its human population
The poultry followed her in interested fashion and swine grunted interrogations at her from behind the bars of their styes but barnyard and rickyard orchard and stables and dairy gave no reward to her search
Then as she retraced her steps towards the kitchen she came suddenly on her cousin young Mr Jim as every one called him who divided his time between amateur horsedealing rabbitshooting and flirting with the farm maids
Im afraid old Martha is dying said Emma
Jim was not the sort of person to whom one had to break news gently
Nonsense he said Martha means to live to a hundred
She told me so and shell do it
She may be actually dying at this moment or it may just be the beginning of the breakup persisted Emma with a feeling of contempt for the slowness and dulness of the young man
A grin spread over his goodnatured features
It dont look like it he said nodding towards the yard
Emma turned to catch the meaning of his remark
Old Martha stood in the middle of a mob of poultry scattering handfuls of grain around her
The turkeycock with the bronzed sheen of his feathers and the purplered of his wattles the gamecock with the glowing metallic lustre of his Eastern plumage the hens with their ochres and buffs and umbers and their scarlet combs and the drakes with their bottlegreen heads made a medley of rich colour in the centre of which the old woman looked like a withered stalk standing amid a riotous growth of gailyhued flowers
But she threw the grain deftly amid the wilderness of beaks and her quavering voice carried as far as the two people who were watching her
She was still harping on the theme of death coming to the farm
I knew twere acoming
Theres been signs an warnings
Whos dead then old Mother
called out the young man
Tis young Mister Ladbruk she shrilled back theyve just acarried his body in
Run out of the way of a tree that was coming down an ran hisself on to an iron post
Dead when they picked un up
Aye I knew twere coming
And she turned to fling a handful of barley at a belated group of guineafowl that came racing toward her
    The farm was a family property and passed to the rabbitshooting cousin as the nextofkin
Emma Ladbruk drifted out of its history as a bee that had wandered in at an open window might flit its way out again
On a cold grey morning she stood waiting with her boxes already stowed in the farm cart till the last of the market produce should be ready for the train she was to catch was of less importance than the chickens and butter and eggs that were to be offered for sale
From where she stood she could see an angle of the long latticed window that was to have been cosy with curtains and gay with bowls of flowers
Into her mind came the thought that for months perhaps for years long after she had been utterly forgotten a white unheeding face would be seen peering out through those latticed panes and a weak muttering voice would be heard quavering up and down those flagged passages
She made her way to a narrow barred casement that opened into the farm larder
Old Martha was standing at a table trussing a pair of chickens for the market stall as she had trussed them for nearly fourscore years
THE LULL IVE asked Latimer Springfield to spend Sunday with us and stop the night announced Mrs Durmot at the breakfasttable
I thought he was in the throes of an election remarked her husband
Exactly the poll is on Wednesday and the poor man will have worked himself to a shadow by that time
Imagine what electioneering must be like in this awful soaking rain going along slushy country roads and speaking to damp audiences in draughty schoolrooms day after day for a fortnight
Hell have to put in an appearance at some place of worship on Sunday morning and he can come to us immediately afterwards and have a thorough respite from everything connected with politics
I wont let him even think of them
Ive had the picture of Cromwell dissolving the Long Parliament taken down from the staircase and even the portrait of Lord Roseberys Ladas removed from the smokingroom
And Vera added Mrs Durmot turning to her sixteenyearold niece be careful what colour ribbon you wear in your hair not blue or yellow on any account those are the rival party colours and emerald green or orange would be almost as bad with this Home Rule business to the fore
On state occasions I always wear a black ribbon in my hair said Vera with crushing dignity
Latimer Springfield was a rather cheerless oldish young man who went into politics somewhat in the spirit in which other people might go into halfmourning
Without being an enthusiast however he was a fairly strenuous plodder and Mrs Durmot had been reasonably near the mark in asserting that he was working at high pressure over this election
The restful lull which his hostess enforced on him was decidedly welcome and yet the nervous excitement of the contest had too great a hold on him to be totally banished
I know hes going to sit up half the night working up points for his final speeches said Mrs Durmot regretfully however weve kept politics at arms length all the afternoon and evening
More than that we cannot do
That remains to be seen said Vera but she said it to herself
Latimer had scarcely shut his bedroom door before he was immersed in a sheaf of notes and pamphlets while a fountainpen and pocketbook were brought into play for the due marshalling of useful facts and discreet fictions
He had been at work for perhaps thirtyfive minutes and the house was seemingly consecrated to the healthy slumber of country life when a stifled squealing and scuffling in the passage was followed by a loud tap at his door
Before he had time to answer a much encumbered Vera burst into the room with the question I say can I leave these here
These were a small black pig and a lusty specimen of blackred gamecock
Latimer was moderately fond of animals and particularly interested in small livestock rearing from the economic point of view in fact one of the pamphlets on which he was at that moment engaged warmly advocated the further development of the pig and poultry industry in our rural districts but he was pardonably unwilling to share even a commodious bedroom with samples of henroost and stye products
Wouldnt they be happier somewhere outside
he asked tactfully expressing his own preference in the matter in an apparent solicitude for theirs
There is no outside said Vera impressively nothing but a waste of dark swirling waters
The reservoir at Brinkley has burst
I didnt know there was a reservoir at Brinkley said Latimer
Well there isnt now its jolly well all over the place and as we stand particularly low were the centre of an inland sea just at present
You see the river has overflowed its banks as well
Good gracious
Have any lives been lost
Heaps I should say
The second housemaid has already identified three bodies that have floated past the billiardroom window as being the young man shes engaged to
Either shes engaged to a large assortment of the population round here or else shes very careless at identification
Of course it may be the same body coming round again and again in a swirl I hadnt thought of that
But we ought to go out and do rescue work oughtnt we
said Latimer with the instinct of a Parliamentary candidate for getting into the local limelight
We cant said Vera decidedly we havent any boats and were cut off by a raging torrent from any human habitation
My aunt particularly hoped you would keep to your room and not add to the confusion but she thought it would be so kind of you if you would take in Hartlepools Wonder the gamecock you know for the night
You see there are eight other gamecocks and they fight like furies if they get together so were putting one in each bedroom
The fowlhouses are all flooded out you know
And then I thought perhaps you wouldnt mind taking in this wee piggie hes rather a little love but he has a vile temper
He gets that from his mother  not that I like to say things against her when shes lying dead and drowned in her stye poor thing
What he really wants is a mans firm hand to keep him in order
Id try and grapple with him myself only Ive got my chow in my room you know and he goes for pigs wherever he finds them
Couldnt the pig go in the bathroom
asked Latimer faintly wishing that he had taken up as determined a stand on the subject of bedroom swine as the chow had
The bathroom
Vera laughed shrilly
Itll be full of Boy Scouts till morning if the hot water holds out
Boy Scouts
Yes thirty of them came to rescue us while the water was only waisthigh then it rose another three feet or so and we had to rescue them
Were giving them hot baths in batches and drying their clothes in the hot air cupboard but of course drenched clothes dont dry in a minute and the corridor and staircase are beginning to look like a bit of coast scenery by Tuke
Two of the boys are wearing your Melton overcoat I hope you dont mind
Its a new overcoat said Latimer with every indication of minding dreadfully
Youll take every care of Hartlepools Wonder wont you
said Vera
His mother took three firsts at Birmingham and he was second in the cockerel class last year at Gloucester
Hell probably roost on the rail at the bottom of your bed
I wonder if hed feel more at home if some of his wives were up here with him
The hens are all in the pantry and I think I could pick out Hartlepool Helen shes his favourite
Latimer showed a belated firmness on the subject of Hartlepool Helen and Vera withdrew without pressing the point having first settled the gamecock on his extemporised perch and taken an affectionate farewell of the pigling
Latimer undressed and got into bed with all due speed judging that the pig would abate its inquisitorial restlessness once the light was turned out
As a substitute for a cosy strawbedded sty the room offered at first inspection few attractions but the disconsolate animal suddenly discovered an appliance in which the most luxuriously contrived piggeries were notably deficient
The sharp edge of the underneath part of the bed was pitched at exactly the right elevation to permit the pigling to scrape himself ecstatically backwards and forwards with an artistic humping of the back at the crucial moment and an accompanying gurgle of longdrawn delight
The gamecock who may have fancied that he was being rocked in the branches of a pinetree bore the motion with greater fortitude than Latimer was able to command
A series of slaps directed at the pigs body were accepted more as an additional and pleasing irritant than as a criticism of conduct or a hint to desist evidently something more than a mans firm hand was needed to deal with the case
Latimer slipped out of bed in search of a weapon of dissuasion
There was sufficient light in the room to enable the pig to detect this manoeuvre and the vile temper inherited from the drowned mother found full play
Latimer bounded back into bed and his conqueror after a few threatening snorts and champings of its jaws resumed its massage operations with renewed zeal
During the long wakeful hours which ensued Latimer tried to distract his mind from his own immediate troubles by dwelling with decent sympathy on the second housemaids bereavement but he found himself more often wondering how many Boy Scouts were sharing his Melton overcoat
The role of Saint Martin malgre lui was not one which appealed to him
Towards dawn the pigling fell into a happy slumber and Latimer might have followed its example but at about the same time Stupor Hartlepooli gave a rousing crow clattered down to the floor and forthwith commenced a spirited combat with his reflection in the wardrobe mirror
Remembering that the bird was more or less under his care Latimer performed Hague Tribunal offices by draping a bathtowel over the provocative mirror but the ensuing peace was local and shortlived
The deflected energies of the gamecock found new outlet in a sudden and sustained attack on the sleeping and temporarily inoffensive pigling and the duel which followed was desperate and embittered beyond any possibility of effective intervention
The feathered combatant had the advantage of being able when hard pressed to take refuge on the bed and freely availed himself of this circumstance the pigling never quite succeeded in hurling himself on to the same eminence but it was not from want of trying
Neither side could claim any decisive success and the struggle had been practically fought to a standstill by the time that the maid appeared with the early morning tea
Lor sir she exclaimed in undisguised astonishment do you want those animals in your room
WANT
The pigling as though aware that it might have outstayed its welcome dashed out at the door and the gamecock followed it at a more dignified pace
If Miss Veras dog sees that pig  
exclaimed the maid and hurried off to avert such a catastrophe
A cold suspicion was stealing over Latimers mind he went to the window and drew up the blind
A light drizzling rain was falling but there was not the faintest trace of any inundation
Some halfhour later he met Vera on the way to the breakfastroom
I should not like to think of you as a deliberate liar he observed coldly but one occasionally has to do things one does not like
At any rate I kept your mind from dwelling on politics all the night said Vera
Which was of course perfectly true
THE UNKINDEST BLOW THE season of strikes seemed to have run itself to a standstill
Almost every trade and industry and calling in which a dislocation could possibly be engineered had indulged in that luxury
The last and least successful convulsion had been the strike of the Worlds Union of Zoological Garden attendants who pending the settlement of certain demands refused to minister further to the wants of the animals committed to their charge or to allow any other keepers to take their place
In this case the threat of the Zoological Gardens authorities that if the men came out the animals should come out also had intensified and precipitated the crisis
The imminent prospect of the larger carnivores to say nothing of rhinoceroses and bull bison roaming at large and unfed in the heart of London was not one which permitted of prolonged conferences
The Government of the day which from its tendency to be a few hours behind the course of events had been nicknamed the Government of the afternoon was obliged to intervene with promptitude and decision
A strong force of Bluejackets was despatched to Regents Park to take over the temporarily abandoned duties of the strikers
Bluejackets were chosen in preference to land forces partly on account of the traditional readiness of the British Navy to go anywhere and do anything partly by reason of the familiarity of the average sailor with monkeys parrots and other tropical fauna but chiefly at the urgent request of the First Lord of the Admiralty who was keenly desirous of an opportunity for performing some personal act of unobtrusive public service within the province of his department
If he insists on feeding the infant jaguar himself in defiance of its mothers wishes there may be another byelection in the north said one of his colleagues with a hopeful inflection in his voice
Byelections are not very desirable at present but we must not be selfish
As a matter of fact the strike collapsed peacefully without any outside intervention
The majority of the keepers had become so attached to their charges that they returned to work of their own accord
And then the nation and the newspapers turned with a sense of relief to happier things
It seemed as if a new era of contentment was about to dawn
Everybody had struck who could possibly want to strike or who could possibly be cajoled or bullied into striking whether they wanted to or not
The lighter and brighter side of life might now claim some attention
And conspicuous among the other topics that sprang into sudden prominence was the pending Falvertoon divorce suit
The Duke of Falvertoon was one of those human HORS DOEUVRES that stimulate the public appetite for sensation without giving it much to feed on
As a mere child he had been precociously brilliant he had declined the editorship of the ANGLIAN REVIEW at an age when most boys are content to have declined MENSA a table and though he could not claim to have originated the Futurist movement in literature his Letters to a possible Grandson written at the age of fourteen had attracted considerable notice
In later days his brilliancy had been less conspicuously displayed
During a debate in the House of Lords on affairs in Morocco at a moment when that country for the fifth time in seven years had brought half Europe to the verge of war he had interpolated the remark a little Moor and how much it is but in spite of the encouraging reception accorded to this one political utterance he was never tempted to a further display in that direction
It began to be generally understood that he did not intend to supplement his numerous town and country residences by living overmuch in the public eye
And then had come the unlookedfor tidings of the imminent proceedings for divorce
And such a divorce
There were crosssuits and allegations and counter allegations charges of cruelty and desertion everything in fact that was necessary to make the case one of the most complicated and sensational of its kind
And the number of distinguished people involved or cited as witnesses not only embraced both political parties in the realm and several Colonial governors but included an exotic contingent from France Hungary the United States of North America and the Grand Duchy of Baden
Hotel accommodation of the more expensive sort began to experience a strain on its resources
It will be quite like the Durbar without the elephants exclaimed an enthusiastic lady who to do her justice had never seen a Durbar
The general feeling was one of thankfulness that the last of the strikes had been got over before the date fixed for the hearing of the great suit
As a reaction from the season of gloom and industrial strife that had just passed away the agencies that purvey and stagemanage sensations laid themselves out to do their level best on this momentous occasion
Men who had made their reputations as special descriptive writers were mobilised from distant corners of Europe and the further side of the Atlantic in order to enrich with their pens the daily printed records of the case one wordpainter who specialised in descriptions of how witnesses turn pale under crossexamination was summoned hurriedly back from a famous and prolonged murder trial in Sicily where indeed his talents were being decidedly wasted
Thumbnail artists and expert kodak manipulators were retained at extravagant salaries and special dress reporters were in high demand
An enterprising Paris firm of costume builders presented the defendant Duchess with three special creations to be worn marked learned and extensively reported at various critical stages of the trial and as for the cinematograph agents their industry and persistence was untiring
Films representing the Duke saying goodbye to his favourite canary on the eve of the trial were in readiness weeks before the event was due to take place other films depicted the Duchess holding imaginary consultations with fictitious lawyers or making a light repast off specially advertised vegetarian sandwiches during a supposed luncheon interval
As far as human foresight and human enterprise could go nothing was lacking to make the trial a success
Two days before the case was down for hearing the advance reporter of an important syndicate obtained an interview with the Duke for the purpose of gleaning some final grains of information concerning his Graces personal arrangements during the trial
I suppose I may say this will be one of the biggest affairs of its kind during the lifetime of a generation began the reporter as an excuse for the unsparing minuteness of detail that he was about to make quest for
I suppose so  if it comes off said the Duke lazily
If
queried the reporter in a voice that was something between a gasp and a scream
The Duchess and I are both thinking of going on strike said the Duke
Strike
The baleful word flashed out in all its old hideous familiarity
Was there to be no end to its recurrence
Do you mean faltered the reporter that you are contemplating a mutual withdrawal of the charges
Precisely said the Duke
But think of the arrangements that have been made the special reporting the cinematographs the catering for the distinguished foreign witnesses the prepared musichall allusions think of all the money that has been sunk   Exactly said the Duke coldly the Duchess and I have realised that it is we who provide the material out of which this great farreaching industry has been built up
Widespread employment will be given and enormous profits made during the duration of the case and we on whom all the stress and racket falls will get  what
An unenviable notoriety and the privilege of paying heavy legal expenses whichever way the verdict goes
Hence our decision to strike
We dont wish to be reconciled we fully realise that it is a grave step to take but unless we get some reasonable consideration out of this vast stream of wealth and industry that we have called into being we intend coming out of court and staying out
Good afternoon
The news of this latest strike spread universal dismay
Its inaccessibility to the ordinary methods of persuasion made it peculiarly formidable
If the Duke and Duchess persisted in being reconciled the Government could hardly be called on to interfere
Public opinion in the shape of social ostracism might be brought to bear on them but that was as far as coercive measures could go
There was nothing for it but a conference with powers to propose liberal terms
As it was several of the foreign witnesses had already departed and others had telegraphed cancelling their hotel arrangements
The conference protracted uncomfortable and occasionally acrimonious succeeded at last in arranging for a resumption of litigation but it was a fruitless victory
The Duke with a touch of his earlier precocity died of premature decay a fortnight before the date fixed for the new trial
THE ROMANCERS IT was autumn in London that blessed season between the harshness of winter and the insincerities of summer a trustful season when one buys bulbs and sees to the registration of ones vote believing perpetually in spring and a change of Government
Morton Crosby sat on a bench in a secluded corner of Hyde Park lazily enjoying a cigarette and watching the slow grazing promenade of a pair of snowgeese the male looking rather like an albino edition of the russethued female
Out of the corner of his eye Crosby also noted with some interest the hesitating hoverings of a human figure which had passed and repassed his seat two or three times at shortening intervals like a wary crow about to alight near some possibly edible morsel
Inevitably the figure came to an anchorage on the bench within easy talking distance of its original occupant
The uncaredfor clothes the aggressive grizzled beard and the furtive evasive eye of the newcomer bespoke the professional cadger the man who would undergo hours of humiliating talespinning and rebuff rather than adventure on half a days decent work
For a while the newcomer fixed his eyes straight in front of him in a strenuous unseeing gaze then his voice broke out with the insinuating inflection of one who has a story to retail well worth any loiterers while to listen to
Its a strange world he said
As the statement met with no response he altered it to the form of a question
I daresay youve found it to be a strange world mister
As far as I am concerned said Crosby the strangeness has worn off in the course of thirtysix years
Ah said the greybeard I could tell you things that youd hardly believe
Marvellous things that have really happened to me
Nowadays there is no demand for marvellous things that have really happened said Crosby discouragingly the professional writers of fiction turn these things out so much better
For instance my neighbours tell me wonderful incredible things that their Aberdeens and chows and borzois have done I never listen to them
On the other hand I have read The Hound of the Baskervilles three times
The greybeard moved uneasily in his seat then he opened up new country
I take it that you are a professing Christian he observed
I am a prominent and I think I may say an influential member of the Mussulman community of Eastern Persia said Crosby making an excursion himself into the realms of fiction
The greybeard was obviously disconcerted at this new check to introductory conversation but the defeat was only momentary
Persia
I should never have taken you for a Persian he remarked with a somewhat aggrieved air
I am not said Crosby my father was an Afghan
An Afghan
said the other smitten into bewildered silence for a moment
Then he recovered himself and renewed his attack
Afghanistan
Ah
Weve had some wars with that country now I daresay instead of fighting it we might have learned something from it
A very wealthy country I believe
No real poverty there
He raised his voice on the word poverty with a suggestion of intense feeling
Crosby saw the opening and avoided it
It possesses nevertheless a number of highly talented and ingenious beggars he said if I had not spoken so disparagingly of marvellous things that have really happened I would tell you the story of Ibrahim and the eleven camelloads of blottingpaper
Also I have forgotten exactly how it ended
My own lifestory is a curious one said the stranger apparently stifling all desire to hear the history of Ibrahim I was not always as you see me now
We are supposed to undergo complete change in the course of every seven years said Crosby as an explanation of the foregoing announcement
I mean I was not always in such distressing circumstances as I am at present pursued the stranger doggedly
That sounds rather rude said Crosby stiffly considering that you are at present talking to a man reputed to be one of the most gifted conversationalists of the Afghan border
I dont mean in that way said the greybeard hastily Ive been very much interested in your conversation
I was alluding to my unfortunate financial situation
You maynt hardly believe it but at the present moment I am absolutely without a farthing
Dont see any prospect of getting any money either for the next few days
I dont suppose youve ever found yourself in such a position he added
In the town of Yom said Crosby which is in Southern Afghanistan and which also happens to be my birthplace there was a Chinese philosopher who used to say that one of the three chiefest human blessings was to be absolutely without money
I forget what the other two were
Ah I daresay said the stranger in a tone that betrayed no enthusiasm for the philosophers memory and did he practise what he preached
Thats the test
He lived happily with very little money or resources said Crosby
Then I expect he had friends who would help him liberally whenever he was in difficulties such as I am in at present
In Yom said Crosby it is not necessary to have friends in order to obtain help
Any citizen of Yom would help a stranger as a matter of course
The greybeard was now genuinely interested
The conversation had at last taken a favourable turn
If someone like me for instance who was in undeserved difficulties asked a citizen of that town you speak of for a small loan to tide over a few days impecuniosity  five shillings or perhaps a rather larger sum  would it be given to him as a matter of course
There would be a certain preliminary said Crosby one would take him to a wineshop and treat him to a measure of wine and then after a little highflown conversation one would put the desired sum in his hand and wish him goodday
It is a roundabout way of performing a simple transaction but in the East all ways are roundabout
The listeners eyes were glittering
Ah he exclaimed with a thin sneer ringing meaningly through his words I suppose youve given up all those generous customs since you left your town
Dont practise them now I expect
No one who has lived in Yom said Crosby fervently and remembers its green hills covered with apricot and almond trees and the cold water that rushes down like a caress from the upland snows and dashes under the little wooden bridges no one who remembers these things and treasures the memory of them would ever give up a single one of its unwritten laws and customs
To me they are as binding as though I still lived in that hallowed home of my youth
Then if I was to ask you for a small loan   began the greybeard fawningly edging nearer on the seat and hurriedly wondering how large he might safely make his request if I was to ask you for say   At any other time certainly said Crosby in the months of November and December however it is absolutely forbidden for anyone of our race to give or receive loans or gifts in fact one does not willingly speak of them
It is considered unlucky
We will therefore close this discussion
But it is still October
exclaimed the adventurer with an eager angry whine as Crosby rose from his seat wants eight days to the end of the month
The Afghan November began yesterday said Crosby severely and in another moment he was striding across the Park leaving his recent companion scowling and muttering furiously on the seat
I dont believe a word of his story he chattered to himself pack of nasty lies from beginning to end
Wish Id told him so to his face
Calling himself an Afghan
The snorts and snarls that escaped from him for the next quarter of an hour went far to support the truth of the old saying that two of a trade never agree
THE SCHARTZMETTERKLUME METHOD LADY CARLOTTA stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length to kill time till the train should be pleased to proceed on its way
Then in the roadway beyond she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living
Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway and put rather a different complexion on the struggle
Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal such interference being none of her business
Only once had she put the doctrine of noninterference into practice when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable maytree by an angry boarpig while Lady Carlotta on the other side of the fence had proceeded with the watercolour sketch she was engaged on and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner
It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady
On this occasion she merely lost the train which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey and steamed off without her
She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her
She wired a vague noncommittal message to her destination to say that she was coming on by another train
Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady who seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks
You must be Miss Hope the governess Ive come to meet said the apparition in a tone that admitted of very little argument
Very well if I must I must said Lady Carlotta to herself with dangerous meekness
I am Mrs Quabarl continued the lady and where pray is your luggage
Its gone astray said the alleged governess falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent are always to blame the luggage had in point of fact behaved with perfect correctitude
Ive just telegraphed about it she added with a nearer approach to truth
How provoking said Mrs Quabarl these railway companies are so careless
However my maid can lend you things for the night and she led the way to her car
During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate sensitive young people that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century
I wish them not only to be TAUGHT said Mrs Quabarl but INTERESTED in what they learn
In their history lessons for instance you must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the lifestories of men and women who really lived not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory
French of course I shall expect you to talk at mealtimes several days in the week
I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three
Russian
My dear Miss Hope no one in the house speaks or understands Russian
That will not embarrass me in the least said Lady Carlotta coldly
Mrs Quabarl to use a colloquial expression was knocked off her perch
She was one of those imperfectly selfassured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed
The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic
When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newlypurchased and expensive car and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject
Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days on beholding his heaviest battleelephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers
At dinner that evening although reinforced by her husband who usually duplicated her opinions and lent her moral support generally Mrs Quabarl regained none of her lost ground
The governess not only helped herself well and truly to wine but held forth with considerable show of critical knowledge on various vintage matters concerning which the Quabarls were in no wise able to pose as authorities
Previous governesses had limited their conversation on the wine topic to a respectful and doubtless sincere expression of a preference for water
When this one went as far as to recommend a wine firm in whose hands you could not go very far wrong Mrs Quabarl thought it time to turn the conversation into more usual channels
We got very satisfactory references about you from Canon Teep she observed a very estimable man I should think
Drinks like a fish and beats his wife otherwise a very lovable character said the governess imperturbably
MY DEAR Miss Hope
I trust you are exaggerating exclaimed the Quabarls in unison
One must in justice admit that there is some provocation continued the romancer
Mrs Teep is quite the most irritating bridgeplayer that I have ever sat down with her leads and declarations would condone a certain amount of brutality in her partner but to souse her with the contents of the only sodawater syphon in the house on a Sunday afternoon when one couldnt get another argues an indifference to the comfort of others which I cannot altogether overlook
You may think me hasty in my judgments but it was practically on account of the syphon incident that I left
We will talk of this some other time said Mrs Quabarl hastily
I shall never allude to it again said the governess with decision
Mr Quabarl made a welcome diversion by asking what studies the new instructress proposed to inaugurate on the morrow
History to begin with she informed him
Ah history he observed sagely now in teaching them history you must take care to interest them in what they learn
You must make them feel that they are being introduced to the lifestories of men and women who really lived   Ive told her all that interposed Mrs Quabarl
I teach history on the SchartzMetterklume method said the governess loftily
Ah yes said her listeners thinking it expedient to assume an acquaintance at least with the name
    What are you children doing out here
demanded Mrs Quabarl the next morning on finding Irene sitting rather glumly at the head of the stairs while her sister was perched in an attitude of depressed discomfort on the windowseat behind her with a wolfskin rug almost covering her
We are having a history lesson came the unexpected reply
I am supposed to be Rome and Viola up there is the shewolf not a real wolf but the figure of one that the Romans used to set store by  I forget why
Claude and Wilfrid have gone to fetch the shabby women
The shabby women
Yes theyve got to carry them off
They didnt want to but Miss Hope got one of fathers fivesbats and said shed give them a number nine spanking if they didnt so theyve gone to do it
A loud angry screaming from the direction of the lawn drew Mrs Quabarl thither in hot haste fearful lest the threatened castigation might even now be in process of infliction
The outcry however came principally from the two small daughters of the lodgekeeper who were being hauled and pushed towards the house by the panting and dishevelled Claude and Wilfrid whose task was rendered even more arduous by the incessant if not very effectual attacks of the captured maidens small brother
The governess fivesbat in hand sat negligently on the stone balustrade presiding over the scene with the cold impartiality of a Goddess of Battles
A furious and repeated chorus of Ill tell muvver rose from the lodgechildren but the lodgemother who was hard of hearing was for the moment immersed in the preoccupation of her washtub
After an apprehensive glance in the direction of the lodge the good woman was gifted with the highly militant temper which is sometimes the privilege of deafness Mrs Quabarl flew indignantly to the rescue of the struggling captives
Wilfrid
Claude
Let those children go at once
Miss Hope what on earth is the meaning of this scene
Early Roman history the Sabine Women dont you know
Its the SchartzMetterklume method to make children understand history by acting it themselves fixes it in their memory you know
Of course if thanks to your interference your boys go through life thinking that the Sabine women ultimately escaped I really cannot be held responsible
You may be very clever and modern Miss Hope said Mrs Quabarl firmly but I should like you to leave here by the next train
Your luggage will be sent after you as soon as it arrives
Im not certain exactly where I shall be for the next few days said the dismissed instructress of youth you might keep my luggage till I wire my address
There are only a couple of trunks and some golfclubs and a leopard cub
A leopard cub
gasped Mrs Quabarl
Even in her departure this extraordinary person seemed destined to leave a trail of embarrassment behind her
Well its rather left off being a cub its more than halfgrown you know
A fowl every day and a rabbit on Sundays is what it usually gets
Raw beef makes it too excitable
Dont trouble about getting the car for me Im rather inclined for a walk
And Lady Carlotta strode out of the Quabarl horizon
The advent of the genuine Miss Hope who had made a mistake as to the day on which she was due to arrive caused a turmoil which that good lady was quite unused to inspiring
Obviously the Quabarl family had been woefully befooled but a certain amount of relief came with the knowledge
How tiresome for you dear Carlotta said her hostess when the overdue guest ultimately arrived how very tiresome losing your train and having to stop overnight in a strange place
Oh dear no said Lady Carlotta not at all tiresome  for me
THE SEVENTH PULLET ITS not the daily grind that I complain of said Blenkinthrope resentfully its the dull grey sameness of my life outside of office hours
Nothing of interest comes my way nothing remarkable or out of the common
Even the little things that I do try to find some interest in dont seem to interest other people
Things in my garden for instance
The potato that weighed just over two pounds said his friend Gorworth
Did I tell you about that
said Blenkinthrope I was telling the others in the train this morning
I forgot if Id told you
To be exact you told me that it weighed just under two pounds but I took into account the fact that abnormal vegetables and freshwater fish have an after life in which growth is not arrested
Youre just like the others said Blenkinthrope sadly you only make fun of it
The fault is with the potato not with us said Gorworth we are not in the least interested in it because it is not in the least interesting
The men you go up in the train with every day are just in the same case as yourself their lives are commonplace and not very interesting to themselves and they certainly are not going to wax enthusiastic over the commonplace events in other mens lives
Tell them something startling dramatic piquant that has happened to yourself or to someone in your family and you will capture their interest at once
They will talk about you with a certain personal pride to all their acquaintances
Man I know intimately fellow called Blenkinthrope lives down my way had two of his fingers clawed clean off by a lobster he was carrying home to supper
Doctor says entire hand may have to come off
Now that is conversation of a very high order
But imagine walking into a tennis club with the remark I know a man who has grown a potato weighing two and a quarter pounds
But hang it all my dear fellow said Blenkinthrope impatiently havent I just told you that nothing of a remarkable nature ever happens to me
Invent something said Gorworth
Since winning a prize for excellence in Scriptural knowledge at a preparatory school he had felt licensed to be a little more unscrupulous than the circle he moved in
Much might surely be excused to one who in early life could give a list of seventeen trees mentioned in the Old Testament
What sort of thing
asked Blenkinthrope somewhat snappishly
A snake got into your henrun yesterday morning and killed six out of seven pullets first mesmerising them with its eyes and then biting them as they stood helpless
The seventh pullet was one of that French sort with feathers all over its eyes so it escaped the mesmeric snare and just flew at what it could see of the snake and pecked it to pieces
Thank you said Blenkinthrope stiffly its a very clever invention
If such a thing had really happened in my poultryrun I admit I should have been proud and interested to tell people about it
But Id rather stick to fact even if it is plain fact
All the same his mind dwelt wistfully on the story of the Seventh Pullet
He could picture himself telling it in the train amid the absorbed interest of his fellowpassengers
Unconsciously all sorts of little details and improvements began to suggest themselves
Wistfulness was still his dominant mood when he took his seat in the railway carriage the next morning
Opposite him sat Stevenham who had attained to a recognised brevet of importance through the fact of an uncle having dropped dead in the act of voting at a Parliamentary election
That had happened three years ago but Stevenham was still deferred to on all questions of home and foreign politics
Hullo hows the giant mushroom or whatever it was
was all the notice Blenkinthrope got from his fellow travellers
Young Duckby whom he mildly disliked speedily monopolised the general attention by an account of a domestic bereavement
Had four young pigeons carried off last night by a whacking big rat
Oh a monster he must have been you could tell by the size of the hole he made breaking into the loft
No moderatesized rat ever seemed to carry out any predatory operations in these regions they were all enormous in their enormity
Pretty hard lines that continued Duckby seeing that he had secured the attention and respect of the company four squeakers carried off at one swoop
Youd find it rather hard to match that in the way of unlooked for bad luck
I had six pullets out of a pen of seven killed by a snake yesterday afternoon said Blenkinthrope in a voice which he hardly recognised as his own
By a snake
came in excited chorus
It fascinated them with its deadly glittering eyes one after the other and struck them down while they stood helpless
A bedridden neighbour who wasnt able to call for assistance witnessed it all from her bedroom window
Well I never
broke in the chorus with variations
The interesting part of it is about the seventh pullet the one that didnt get killed resumed Blenkinthrope slowly lighting a cigarette
His diffidence had left him and he was beginning to realise how safe and easy depravity can seem once one has the courage to begin
The six dead birds were Minorcas the seventh was a Houdan with a mop of feathers all over its eyes
It could hardly see the snake at all so of course it wasnt mesmerised like the others
It just could see something wriggling on the ground and went for it and pecked it to death
Well Im blessed
exclaimed the chorus
In the course of the next few days Blenkinthrope discovered how little the loss of ones selfrespect affects one when one has gained the esteem of the world
His story found its way into one of the poultry papers and was copied thence into a daily newssheet as a matter of general interest
A lady wrote from the North of Scotland recounting a similar episode which she had witnessed as occurring between a stoat and a blind grouse
Somehow a lie seems so much less reprehensible when one can call it a lee
For awhile the adapter of the Seventh Pullet story enjoyed to the full his altered standing as a person of consequence one who had had some share in the strange events of his times
Then he was thrust once again into the cold grey background by the sudden blossoming into importance of SmithPaddon a daily fellowtraveller whose little girl had been knocked down and nearly hurt by a car belonging to a musicalcomedy actress
The actress was not in the car at the time but she was in numerous photographs which appeared in the illustrated papers of Zoto Dobreen inquiring after the wellbeing of Maisie daughter of Edmund SmithPaddon Esq
With this new human interest to absorb them the travelling companions were almost rude when Blenkinthrope tried to explain his contrivance for keeping vipers and peregrine falcons out of his chickenrun
Gorworth to whom he unburdened himself in private gave him the same counsel as heretofore
Invent something
Yes but what
The ready affirmative coupled with the question betrayed a significant shifting of the ethical standpoint
It was a few days later that Blenkinthrope revealed a chapter of family history to the customary gathering in the railway carriage
Curious thing happened to my aunt the one who lives in Paris he began
He had several aunts but they were all geographically distributed over Greater London
She was sitting on a seat in the Bois the other afternoon after lunching at the Roumanian Legation
Whatever the story gained in picturesqueness from the draggingin of diplomatic atmosphere it ceased from that moment to command any acceptance as a record of current events
Gorworth had warned his neophyte that this would be the case but the traditional enthusiasm of the neophyte had triumphed over discretion
She was feeling rather drowsy the effect probably of the champagne which shes not in the habit of taking in the middle of the day
A subdued murmur of admiration went round the company
Blenkinthropes aunts were not used to taking champagne in the middle of the year regarding it exclusively as a Christmas and New Year accessory
Presently a rather portly gentleman passed by her seat and paused an instant to light a cigar
At that moment a youngish man came up behind him drew the blade from a swordstick and stabbed him half a dozen times through and through
Scoundrel he cried to his victim you do not know me
My name is Henri Leturc
The elder man wiped away some of the blood that was spattering his clothes turned to his assailant and said And since when has an attempted assassination been considered an introduction
Then he finished lighting his cigar and walked away
My aunt had intended screaming for the police but seeing the indifference with which the principal in the affair treated the matter she felt that it would be an impertinence on her part to interfere
Of course I need hardly say she put the whole thing down to the effects of a warm drowsy afternoon and the Legation champagne
Now comes the astonishing part of my story
A fortnight later a bank manager was stabbed to death with a swordstick in that very part of the Bois
His assassin was the son of a charwoman formerly working at the bank who had been dismissed from her job by the manager on account of chronic intemperance
His name was Henri Leturc
From that moment Blenkinthrope was tacitly accepted as the Munchausen of the party
No effort was spared to draw him out from day to day in the exercise of testing their powers of credulity and Blenkinthrope in the false security of an assured and receptive audience waxed industrious and ingenious in supplying the demand for marvels
Duckbys satirical story of a tame otter that had a tank in the garden to swim in and whined restlessly whenever the waterrate was overdue was scarcely an unfair parody of some of Blenkinthropes wilder efforts
And then one day came Nemesis
Returning to his villa one evening Blenkinthrope found his wife sitting in front of a pack of cards which she was scrutinising with unusual concentration
The same old patiencegame
he asked carelessly
No dear this is the Deaths Head patience the most difficult of them all
Ive never got it to work out and somehow I should be rather frightened if I did
Mother only got it out once in her life she was afraid of it too
Her greataunt had done it once and fallen dead from excitement the next moment and mother always had a feeling that she would die if she ever got it out
She died the same night that she did it
She was in bad health at the time certainly but it was a strange coincidence
Dont do it if it frightens you was Blenkinthropes practical comment as he left the room
A few minutes later his wife called to him
John it gave me such a turn I nearly got it out
Only the five of diamonds held me up at the end
I really thought Id done it
Why you can do it said Blenkinthrope who had come back to the room if you shift the eight of clubs on to that open nine the five can be moved on to the six
His wife made the suggested move with hasty trembling fingers and piled the outstanding cards on to their respective packs
Then she followed the example of her mother and greatgrandaunt
Blenkinthrope had been genuinely fond of his wife but in the midst of his bereavement one dominant thought obtruded itself
Something sensational and real had at last come into his life no longer was it a grey colourless record
The headlines which might appropriately describe his domestic tragedy kept shaping themselves in his brain
Inherited presentiment comes true
The Deaths Head patience Cardgame that justified its sinister name in three generations
He wrote out a full story of the fatal occurrence for the ESSEX VEDETTE the editor of which was a friend of his and to another friend he gave a condensed account to be taken up to the office of one of the halfpenny dailies
But in both cases his reputation as a romancer stood fatally in the way of the fulfilment of his ambitions
Not the right thing to be Munchausening in a time of sorrow agreed his friends among themselves and a brief note of regret at the sudden death of the wife of our respected neighbour Mr John Blenkinthrope from heart failure appearing in the news column of the local paper was the forlorn outcome of his visions of widespread publicity
Blenkinthrope shrank from the society of his erstwhile travelling companions and took to travelling townwards by an earlier train
He sometimes tries to enlist the sympathy and attention of a chance acquaintance in details of the whistling prowess of his best canary or the dimensions of his largest beetroot he scarcely recognises himself as the man who was once spoken about and pointed out as the owner of the Seventh Pullet
THE BLIND SPOT YOUVE just come back from Adelaides funeral havent you
said Sir Lulworth to his nephew I suppose it was very like most other funerals
Ill tell you all about it at lunch said Egbert
Youll do nothing of the sort
It wouldnt be respectful either to your greataunts memory or to the lunch
We begin with Spanish olives then a borshch then more olives and a bird of some kind and a rather enticing Rhenish wine not at all expensive as wines go in this country but still quite laudable in its way
Now theres absolutely nothing in that menu that harmonises in the least with the subject of your great aunt Adelaide or her funeral
She was a charming woman and quite as intelligent as she had any need to be but somehow she always reminded me of an English cooks idea of a Madras curry
She used to say you were frivolous said Egbert
Something in his tone suggested that he rather endorsed the verdict
I believe I once considerably scandalised her by declaring that clear soup was a more important factor in life than a clear conscience
She had very little sense of proportion
By the way she made you her principal heir didnt she
Yes said Egbert and executor as well
Its in that connection that I particularly want to speak to you
Business is not my strong point at any time said Sir Lulworth and certainly not when were on the immediate threshold of lunch
It isnt exactly business explained Egbert as he followed his uncle into the diningroom
Its something rather serious
Very serious
Then we cant possibly speak about it now said Sir Lulworth no one could talk seriously during a borshch
A beautifully constructed borshch such as you are going to experience presently ought not only to banish conversation but almost to annihilate thought
Later on when we arrive at the second stage of olives I shall be quite ready to discuss that new book on Borrow or if you prefer it the present situation in the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg
But I absolutely decline to talk anything approaching business till we have finished with the bird
For the greater part of the meal Egbert sat in an abstracted silence the silence of a man whose mind is focussed on one topic
When the coffee stage had been reached he launched himself suddenly athwart his uncles reminiscences of the Court of Luxemburg
I think I told you that greataunt Adelaide had made me her executor
There wasnt very much to be done in the way of legal matters but I had to go through her papers
That would be a fairly heavy task in itself
I should imagine there were reams of family letters
Stacks of them and most of them highly uninteresting
There was one packet however which I thought might repay a careful perusal
It was a bundle of correspondence from her brother Peter
The Canon of tragic memory said Lulworth
Exactly of tragic memory as you say a tragedy that has never been fathomed
Probably the simplest explanation was the correct one said Sir Lulworth he slipped on the stone staircase and fractured his skull in falling
Egbert shook his head
The medical evidence all went to prove that the blow on the head was struck by some one coming up behind him
A wound caused by violent contact with the steps could not possibly have been inflicted at that angle of the skull
They experimented with a dummy figure falling in every conceivable position
But the motive
exclaimed Sir Lulworth no one had any interest in doing away with him and the number of people who destroy Canons of the Established Church for the mere fun of killing must be extremely limited
Of course there are individuals of weak mental balance who do that sort of thing but they seldom conceal their handiwork they are more generally inclined to parade it
His cook was under suspicion said Egbert shortly
I know he was said Sir Lulworth simply because he was about the only person on the premises at the time of the tragedy
But could anything be sillier than trying to fasten a charge of murder on to Sebastien
He had nothing to gain in fact a good deal to lose from the death of his employer
The Canon was paying him quite as good wages as I was able to offer him when I took him over into my service
I have since raised them to something a little more in accordance with his real worth but at the time he was glad to find a new place without troubling about an increase of wages
People were fighting rather shy of him and he had no friends in this country
No if anyone in the world was interested in the prolonged life and unimpaired digestion of the Canon it would certainly be Sebastien
People dont always weigh the consequences of their rash acts said Egbert otherwise there would be very few murders committed
Sebastien is a man of hot temper
He is a southerner admitted Sir Lulworth to be geographically exact I believe he hails from the French slopes of the Pyrenees
I took that into consideration when he nearly killed the gardeners boy the other day for bringing him a spurious substitute for sorrel
One must always make allowances for origin and locality and early environment Tell me your longitude and Ill know what latitude to allow you is my motto
There you see said Egbert he nearly killed the gardeners boy
My dear Egbert between nearly killing a gardeners boy and altogether killing a Canon there is a wide difference
No doubt you have often felt a temporary desire to kill a gardeners boy you have never given way to it and I respect you for your selfcontrol
But I dont suppose you have ever wanted to kill an octogenarian Canon
Besides as far as we know there had never been any quarrel or disagreement between the two men
The evidence at the inquest brought that out very clearly
Ah
said Egbert with the air of a man coming at last into a deferred inheritance of conversational importance that is precisely what I want to speak to you about
He pushed away his coffee cup and drew a pocketbook from his inner breastpocket
From the depths of the pocketbook he produced an envelope and from the envelope he extracted a letter closely written in a small neat handwriting
One of the Canons numerous letters to Aunt Adelaide he explained written a few days before his death
Her memory was already failing when she received it and I daresay she forgot the contents as soon as she had read it otherwise in the light of what subsequently happened we should have heard something of this letter before now
If it had been produced at the inquest I fancy it would have made some difference in the course of affairs
The evidence as you remarked just now choked off suspicion against Sebastien by disclosing an utter absence of anything that could be considered a motive or provocation for the crime if crime there was
Oh read the letter said Sir Lulworth impatiently
Its a long rambling affair like most of his letters in his later years said Egbert
Ill read the part that bears immediately on the mystery 
I very much fear I shall have to get rid of Sebastien
He cooks divinely but he has the temper of a fiend or an anthropoid ape and I am really in bodily fear of him
We had a dispute the other day as to the correct sort of lunch to be served on Ash Wednesday and I got so irritated and annoyed at his conceit and obstinacy that at last I threw a cupful of coffee in his face and called him at the same time an impudent jackanapes
Very little of the coffee went actually in his face but I have never seen a human being show such deplorable lack of selfcontrol
I laughed at the threat of killing me that he spluttered out in his rage and thought the whole thing would blow over but I have several times since caught him scowling and muttering in a highly unpleasant fashion and lately I have fancied that he was dogging my footsteps about the grounds particularly when I walk of an evening in the Italian Garden
It was on the steps in the Italian Garden that the body was found commented Egbert and resumed reading 
I daresay the danger is imaginary but I shall feel more at ease when he has quitted my service
 Egbert paused for a moment at the conclusion of the extract then as his uncle made no remark he added If lack of motive was the only factor that saved Sebastien from prosecution I fancy this letter will put a different complexion on matters
Have you shown it to anyone else
asked Sir Lulworth reaching out his hand for the incriminating piece of paper
No said Egbert handing it across the table I thought I would tell you about it first
Heavens what are you doing
Egberts voice rose almost to a scream
Sir Lulworth had flung the paper well and truly into the glowing centre of the grate
The small neat hand writing shrivelled into black flaky nothingness
What on earth did you do that for
gasped Egbert
That letter was our one piece of evidence to connect Sebastien with the crime
That is why I destroyed it said Sir Lulworth
But why should you want to shield him
cried Egbert the man is a common murderer
A common murderer possibly but a very uncommon cook
DUSK NORMAN GORTSBY sat on a bench in the Park with his back to a strip of bushplanted sward fenced by the park railings and the Row fronting him across a wide stretch of carriage drive
Hyde Park Corner with its rattle and hoot of traffic lay immediately to his right
It was some thirty minutes past six on an early March evening and dusk had fallen heavily over the scene dusk mitigated by some faint moonlight and many street lamps
There was a wide emptiness over road and sidewalk and yet there were many unconsidered figures moving silently through the halflight or dotted unobtrusively on bench and chair scarcely to be distinguished from the shadowed gloom in which they sat
The scene pleased Gortsby and harmonised with his present mood
Dusk to his mind was the hour of the defeated
Men and women who had fought and lost who hid their fallen fortunes and dead hopes as far as possible from the scrutiny of the curious came forth in this hour of gloaming when their shabby clothes and bowed shoulders and unhappy eyes might pass unnoticed or at any rate unrecognised
A king that is conquered must see strange looks So bitter a thing is the heart of man
The wanderers in the dusk did not choose to have strange looks fasten on them therefore they came out in this batfashion taking their pleasure sadly in a pleasureground that had emptied of its rightful occupants
Beyond the sheltering screen of bushes and palings came a realm of brilliant lights and noisy rushing traffic
A blazing manytiered stretch of windows shone through the dusk and almost dispersed it marking the haunts of those other people who held their own in lifes struggle or at any rate had not had to admit failure
So Gortsbys imagination pictured things as he sat on his bench in the almost deserted walk
He was in the mood to count himself among the defeated
Money troubles did not press on him had he so wished he could have strolled into the thoroughfares of light and noise and taken his place among the jostling ranks of those who enjoyed prosperity or struggled for it
He had failed in a more subtle ambition and for the moment he was heartsore and disillusionised and not disinclined to take a certain cynical pleasure in observing and labelling his fellow wanderers as they went their ways in the dark stretches between the lamplights
On the bench by his side sat an elderly gentleman with a drooping air of defiance that was probably the remaining vestige of selfrespect in an individual who had ceased to defy successfully anybody or anything
His clothes could scarcely be called shabby at least they passed muster in the halflight but ones imagination could not have pictured the wearer embarking on the purchase of a halfcrown box of chocolates or laying out ninepence on a carnation buttonhole
He belonged unmistakably to that forlorn orchestra to whose piping no one dances he was one of the worlds lamenters who induce no responsive weeping
As he rose to go Gortsby imagined him returning to a home circle where he was snubbed and of no account or to some bleak lodging where his ability to pay a weekly bill was the beginning and end of the interest he inspired
His retreating figure vanished slowly into the shadows and his place on the bench was taken almost immediately by a young man fairly well dressed but scarcely more cheerful of mien than his predecessor
As if to emphasise the fact that the world went badly with him the newcorner unburdened himself of an angry and very audible expletive as he flung himself into the seat
You dont seem in a very good temper said Gortsby judging that he was expected to take due notice of the demonstration
The young man turned to him with a look of disarming frankness which put him instantly on his guard
You wouldnt be in a good temper if you were in the fix Im in he said Ive done the silliest thing Ive ever done in my life
Yes
said Gortsby dispassionately
Came up this afternoon meaning to stay at the Patagonian Hotel in Berkshire Square continued the young man when I got there I found it had been pulled down some weeks ago and a cinema theatre run up on the site
The taxi driver recommended me to another hotel some way off and I went there
I just sent a letter to my people giving them the address and then I went out to buy some soap  Id forgotten to pack any and I hate using hotel soap
Then I strolled about a bit had a drink at a bar and looked at the shops and when I came to turn my steps back to the hotel I suddenly realised that I didnt remember its name or even what street it was in
Theres a nice predicament for a fellow who hasnt any friends or connections in London
Of course I can wire to my people for the address but they wont have got my letter till tomorrow meantime Im without any money came out with about a shilling on me which went in buying the soap and getting the drink and here I am wandering about with twopence in my pocket and nowhere to go for the night
There was an eloquent pause after the story had been told
I suppose you think Ive spun you rather an impossible yarn said the young man presentlywith a suggestion of resentment in his voice
Not at all impossible said Gortsby judicially I remember doing exactly the same thing once in a foreign capital and on that occasion there were two of us which made it more remarkable
Luckily we remembered that the hotel was on a sort of canal and when we struck the canal we were able to find our way back to the hotel
The youth brightened at the reminiscence
In a foreign city I wouldnt mind so much he said one could go to ones Consul and get the requisite help from him
Here in ones own land one is far more derelict if one gets into a fix
Unless I can find some decent chap to swallow my story and lend me some money I seem likely to spend the night on the Embankment
Im glad anyhow that you dont think the story outrageously improbable
He threw a good deal of warmth into the last remark as though perhaps to indicate his hope that Gortsby did not fall far short of the requisite decency
Of course said Gortsby slowly the weak point of your story is that you cant produce the soap
The young man sat forward hurriedly felt rapidly in the pockets of his overcoat and then jumped to his feet
I must have lost it he muttered angrily
To lose an hotel and a cake of soap on one afternoon suggests wilful carelessness said Gortsby but the young man scarcely waited to hear the end of the remark
He flitted away down the path his head held high with an air of somewhat jaded jauntiness
It was a pity mused Gortsby the going out to get ones own soap was the one convincing touch in the whole story and yet it was just that little detail that brought him to grief
If he had had the brilliant forethought to provide himself with a cake of soap wrapped and sealed with all the solicitude of the chemists counter he would have been a genius in his particular line
In his particular line genius certainly consists of an infinite capacity for taking precautions
With that reflection Gortsby rose to go as he did so an exclamation of concern escaped him
Lying on the ground by the side of the bench was a small oval packet wrapped and sealed with the solicitude of a chemists counter
It could be nothing else but a cake of soap and it had evidently fallen out of the youths overcoat pocket when he flung himself down on the seat
In another moment Gortsby was scudding along the dusk shrouded path in anxious quest for a youthful figure in a light overcoat
He had nearly given up the search when he caught sight of the object of his pursuit standing irresolutely on the border of the carriage drive evidently uncertain whether to strike across the Park or make for the bustling pavements of Knightsbridge
He turned round sharply with an air of defensive hostility when he found Gortsby hailing him
The important witness to the genuineness of your story has turned up said Gortsby holding out the cake of soap it must have slid out of your overcoat pocket when you sat down on the seat
I saw it on the ground after you left
You must excuse my disbelief but appearances were really rather against you and now as I appealed to the testimony of the soap I think I ought to abide by its verdict
If the loan of a sovereign is any good to you   The young man hastily removed all doubt on the subject by pocketing the coin
Here is my card with my address continued Gortsby any day this week will do for returning the money and here is the soap  dont lose it again its been a good friend to you
Lucky thing your finding it said the youth and then with a catch in his voice he blurted out a word or two of thanks and fled headlong in the direction of Knightsbridge
Poor boy he as nearly as possible broke down said Gortsby to himself
I dont wonder either the relief from his quandary must have been acute
Its a lesson to me not to be too clever in judging by circumstances
As Gortsby retraced his steps past the seat where the little drama had taken place he saw an elderly gentleman poking and peering beneath it and on all sides of it and recognised his earlier fellow occupant
Have you lost anything sir
he asked
Yes sir a cake of soap
A TOUCH OF REALISM I HOPE youve come full of suggestions for Christmas said Lady Blonze to her latest arrived guest the oldfashioned Christmas and the uptodate Christmas are both so played out
I want to have something really original this year
I was staying with the Mathesons last month said Blanche Boveal eagerly and we had such a good idea
Every one in the houseparty had to be a character and behave consistently all the time and at the end of the visit one had to guess what every ones character was
The one who was voted to have acted his or her character best got a prize
It sounds amusing said Lady Blonze
I was St Francis of Assisi continued Blanche we hadnt got to keep to our right sexes
I kept getting up in the middle of a meal and throwing out food to the birds you see the chief thing that one remembers of St Francis is that he was fond of the birds
Every one was so stupid about it and thought that I was the old man who feeds the sparrows in the Tuileries Gardens
Then Colonel Pentley was the Jolly Miller on the banks of Dee
How on earth did he do that
asked Bertie van Tahn 
He laughed and sang from morn till night  explained Blanche
How dreadful for the rest of you said Bertie and anyway he wasnt on the banks of Dee
One had to imagine that said Blanche
If you could imagine all that you might as well imagine cattle on the further bank and keep on calling them home Maryfashion across the sands of Dee
Or you might change the river to the Yarrow and imagine it was on the top of you and say you were Willie or whoever it was drowned in Yarrow
Of course its easy to make fun of it said Blanche sharply but it was extremely interesting and amusing
The prize was rather a fiasco though
You see Millie Matheson said her character was Lady Bountiful and as she was our hostess of course we all had to vote that she had carried out her character better than anyone
Otherwise I ought to have got the prize
Its quite an idea for a Christmas party said Lady Blonze we must certainly do it here
Sir Nicholas was not so enthusiastic
Are you quite sure my dear that youre wise in doing this thing
he said to his wife when they were alone together
It might do very well at the Mathesons where they had rather a staid elderly houseparty but here it will be a different matter
There is the Durmot flapper for instance who simply stops at nothing and you know what Van Tahn is like
Then there is Cyril Skatterly he has madness on one side of his family and a Hungarian grandmother on the other
I dont see what they could do that would matter said Lady Blonze
Its the unknown that is to be dreaded said Sir Nicholas
If Skatterly took it into his head to represent a Bull of Bashan well Id rather not be here
Of course we shant allow any Bible characters
Besides I dont know what the Bulls of Bashan really did that was so very dreadful they just came round and gaped as far as I remember
My dear you dont know what Skatterlys Hungarian imagination mightnt read into the part it would be small satisfaction to say to him afterwards Youve behaved as no Bull of Bashan would have behaved
 Oh youre an alarmist said Lady Blonze I particularly want to have this idea carried out
It will be sure to be talked about a lot
That is quite possible said Sir Nicholas
    Dinner that evening was not a particularly lively affair the strain of trying to impersonate a self imposed character or to glean hints of identity from other peoples conduct acted as a check on the natural festivity of such a gathering
There was a general feeling of gratitude and acquiescence when goodnatured Rachel Klammerstein suggested that there should be an hour or twos respite from the game while they all listened to a little pianoplaying after dinner
Rachels love of piano music was not indiscriminate and concentrated itself chiefly on selections rendered by her idolised offspring Moritz and Augusta who to do them justice played remarkably well
The Klammersteins were deservedly popular as Christmas guests they gave expensive gifts lavishly on Christmas Day and New Year and Mrs Klammerstein had already dropped hints of her intention to present the prize for the best enacted character in the game competition
Every one had brightened at this prospect if it had fallen to Lady Blonze as hostess to provide the prize she would have considered that a little souvenir of some twenty or twentyfive shillings value would meet the case whereas coming from a Klammerstein source it would certainly run to several guineas
The close time for impersonation efforts came to an end with the final withdrawal of Moritz and Augusta from the piano
Blanche Boveal retired early leaving the room in a series of laboured leaps that she hoped might be recognised as a tolerable imitation of Pavlova
Vera Durmot the sixteenyearold flapper expressed her confident opinion that the performance was intended to typify Mark Twains famous jumping frog and her diagnosis of the case found general acceptance
Another guest to set an example of early bedgoing was Waldo Plubley who conducted his life on a minutely regulated system of timetables and hygienic routine
Waldo was a plump indolent young man of sevenandtwenty whose mother had early in his life decided for him that he was unusually delicate and by dint of much coddling and homekeeping had succeeded in making him physically soft and mentally peevish
Nine hours unbroken sleep preceded by elaborate breathing exercises and other hygienic ritual was among the indispensable regulations which Waldo imposed on himself and there were innumerable small observances which he exacted from those who were in any way obliged to minister to his requirements a special teapot for the decoction of his early tea was always solemnly handed over to the bedroom staff of any house in which he happened to be staying
No one had ever quite mastered the mechanism of this precious vessel but Bertie van Tahn was responsible for the legend that its spout had to be kept facing north during the process of infusion
On this particular night the irreducible nine hours were severely mutilated by the sudden and by no means noiseless incursion of a pyjamaclad figure into Waldos room at an hour midway between midnight and dawn
What is the matter
What are you looking for
asked the awakened and astonished Waldo slowly recognising Van Tahn who appeared to be searching hastily for something he had lost
Looking for sheep was the reply
Sheep
exclaimed Waldo
Yes sheep
You dont suppose Im looking for giraffes do you
I dont see why you should expect to find either in my room retorted Waldo furiously
I cant argue the matter at this hour of the night said Bertie and began hastily rummaging in the chest of drawers
Shirts and underwear went flying on to the floor
There are no sheep here I tell you screamed Waldo
Ive only got your word for it said Bertie whisking most of the bedclothes on to the floor if you werent concealing something you wouldnt be so agitated
Waldo was by this time convinced that Van Tahn was raving mad and made an anxious effort to humour him
Go back to bed like a dear fellow he pleaded and your sheep will turn up all right in the morning
I daresay said Bertie gloomily without their tails
Nice fool I shall look with a lot of Manx sheep
And by way of emphasising his annoyance at the prospect he sent Waldos pillows flying to the top of the wardrobe
But WHY no tails
asked Waldo whose teeth were chattering with fear and rage and lowered temperature
My dear boy have you never heard the ballad of Little BoPeep
said Bertie with a chuckle
Its my character in the Game you know
If I didnt go hunting about for my lost sheep no one would be able to guess who I was and now go to sleepy weeps like a good child or I shall be cross with you
I leave you to imagine wrote Waldo in the course of a long letter to his mother how much sleep I was able to recover that night and you know how essential nine uninterrupted hours of slumber are to my health
On the other hand he was able to devote some wakeful hours to exercises in breathing wrath and fury against Bertie van Tahn
Breakfast at Blonzecourt was a scattered meal on the come when you please principle but the houseparty was supposed to gather in full strength at lunch
On the day after the Game had been started there were however some notable absentees
Waldo Plubley for instance was reported to be nursing a headache
A large breakfast and an ABC
had been taken up to his room but he had made no appearance in the flesh
I expect hes playing up to some character said Vera Durmot isnt there a thing of Molieres LE MALADE IMAGINAIRE
I expect hes that
Eight or nine lists came out and were duly pencilled with the suggestion
And where are the Klammersteins
asked Lady Blonze theyre usually so punctual
Another character pose perhaps said Bertie van Tahn  the Lost Ten Tribes
 But there are only three of them
Besides theyll want their lunch
Hasnt anyone seen anything of them
Didnt you take them out in your car
asked Blanche Boveal addressing herself to Cyril Skatterly
Yes took them out to Slogberry Moor immediately after breakfast
Miss Durmot came too
I saw you and Vera come back said Lady Blonze but I didnt see the Klammersteins
Did you put them down in the village
No said Skatterly shortly
But where are they
Where did you leave them
We left them on Slogberry Moor said Vera calmly
On Slogberry Moor
Why its more than thirty miles away
How are they going to get back
We didnt stop to consider that said Skatterly we asked them to get out for a moment on the pretence that the car had stuck and then we dashed off full speed and left them there
But how dare you do such a thing
Its most inhuman
Why its been snowing for the last hour
I expect therell be a cottage or farmhouse somewhere if they walk a mile or two
But why on earth have you done it
The question came in a chorus of indignant bewilderment
THAT would be telling what our characters are meant to be said Vera
Didnt I warn you
said Sir Nicholas tragically to his wife
Its something to do with Spanish history we dont mind giving you that clue said Skatterly helping himself cheerfully to salad and then Bertie van Tahn broke forth into peals of joyous laughter
Ive got it
Ferdinand and Isabella deporting the Jews
Oh lovely
Those two have certainly won the prize we shant get anything to beat that for thoroughness
Lady Blonzes Christmas party was talked about and written about to an extent that she had not anticipated in her most ambitious moments
The letters from Waldos mother would alone have made it memorable
COUSIN TERESA BASSET HARROWCLUFF returned to the home of his fathers after an absence of four years distinctly well pleased with himself
He was only thirtyone but he had put in some useful service in an outoftheway though not unimportant corner of the world
He had quieted a province kept open a trade route enforced the tradition of respect which is worth the ransom of many kings in outoftheway regions and done the whole business on rather less expenditure than would be requisite for organising a charity in the home country
In Whitehall and places where they think they doubtless thought well of him
It was not inconceivable his father allowed himself to imagine that Bassets name might figure in the next list of Honours
Basset was inclined to be rather contemptuous of his halfbrother Lucas whom he found feverishly engrossed in the same medley of elaborate futilities that had claimed his whole time and energies such as they were four years ago and almost as far back before that as he could remember
It was the contempt of the man of action for the man of activities and it was probably reciprocated
Lucas was an overwell nourished individual some nine years Bassets senior with a colouring that would have been accepted as a sign of intensive culture in an asparagus but probably meant in this case mere abstention from exercise
His hair and forehead furnished a recessional note in a personality that was in all other respects obtrusive and assertive
There was certainly no Semitic blood in Lucass parentage but his appearance contrived to convey at least a suggestion of Jewish extraction
Clovis Sangrail who knew most of his associates by sight said it was undoubtedly a case of protective mimicry
Two days after Bassets return Lucas frisked in to lunch in a state of twittering excitement that could not be restrained even for the immediate consideration of soup but had to be verbally discharged in spluttering competition with mouthfuls of vermicelli
Ive got hold of an idea for something immense he babbled something that is simply It
Basset gave a short laugh that would have done equally well as a snort if one had wanted to make the exchange
His halfbrother was in the habit of discovering futilities that were simply It at frequently recurring intervals
The discovery generally meant that he flew up to town preceded by glowingly worded telegrams to see some one connected with the stage or the publishing world got together one or two momentous luncheon parties flitted in and out of Gambrinus for one or two evenings and returned home with an air of subdued importance and the asparagus tint slightly intensified
The great idea was generally forgotten a few weeks later in the excitement of some new discovery
The inspiration came to me whilst I was dressing announced Lucas it will be THE thing in the next music hall REVUE
All London will go mad over it
Its just a couplet of course there will be other words but they wont matter
Listen Cousin Teresa takes out Caesar Fido Jock and the big borzoi
A lifting catchy sort of refrain you see and big drum business on the two syllables of borzoi
Its immense
And Ive thought out all the business of it the singer will sing the first verse alone then during the second verse Cousin Teresa will walk through followed by four wooden dogs on wheels Caesar will be an Irish terrier Fido a black poodle Jock a foxterrier and the borzoi of course will be a borzoi
During the third verse Cousin Teresa will come on alone and the dogs will be drawn across by themselves from the opposite wing then Cousin Teresa will catch on to the singer and go offstage in one direction while the dogs procession goes off in the other crossing en route which is always very effective
Therell be a lot of applause there and for the fourth verse Cousin Teresa will come on in sables and the dogs will all have coats on
Then Ive got a great idea for the fifth verse each of the dogs will be led on by a Nut and Cousin Teresa will come on from the opposite side crossing en route always effective and then she turns round and leads the whole lot of them off on a string and all the time every one singing like mad Cousin Teresa takes out Caesar Fido Jock and the big borzoi
TumTum
Drum business on the two last syllables
Im so excited I shant sleep a wink tonight
Im off tomorrow by the tenfifteen
Ive wired to Hermanova to lunch with me
If any of the rest of the family felt any excitement over the creation of Cousin Teresa they were signally successful in concealing the fact
Poor Lucas does take his silly little ideas seriously said Colonel Harrowcluff afterwards in the smokingroom
Yes said his younger son in a slightly less tolerant tone in a day or two hell come back and tell us that his sensational masterpiece is above the heads of the public and in about three weeks time hell be wild with enthusiasm over a scheme to dramatise the poems of Herrick or something equally promising
And then an extraordinary thing befell
In defiance of all precedent Lucass glowing anticipations were justified and endorsed by the course of events
If Cousin Teresa was above the heads of the public the public heroically adapted itself to her altitude
Introduced as an experiment at a dull moment in a new REVUE the success of the item was unmistakable the calls were so insistent and uproarious that even Lucas ample devisings of additional business scarcely sufficed to keep pace with the demand
Packed houses on successive evenings confirmed the verdict of the first night audience stalls and boxes filled significantly just before the turn came on and emptied significantly after the last ENCORE had been given
The manager tearfully acknowledged that Cousin Teresa was It
Stage hands and supers and programme sellers acknowledged it to one another without the least reservation
The name of the REVUE dwindled to secondary importance and vast letters of electric blue blazoned the words Cousin Teresa from the front of the great palace of pleasure
And of course the magic of the famous refrain laid its spell all over the Metropolis
Restaurant proprietors were obliged to provide the members of their orchestras with painted wooden dogs on wheels in order that the muchdemanded and always conceded melody should be rendered with the necessary spectacular effects and the crash of bottles and forks on the tables at the mention of the big borzoi usually drowned the sincerest efforts of drum or cymbals
Nowhere and at no time could one get away from the double thump that brought up the rear of the refrain revellers reeling home at night banged it on doors and hoardings milkmen clashed their cans to its cadence messenger boys hit smaller messenger boys resounding double smacks on the same principle
And the more thoughtful circles of the great city were not deaf to the claims and significance of the popular melody
An enterprising and emancipated preacher discoursed from his pulpit on the inner meaning of Cousin Teresa and Lucas Harrowcluff was invited to lecture on the subject of his great achievement to members of the Young Mens Endeavour League the Nine Arts Club and other learned and willingtolearn bodies
In Society it seemed to be the one thing people really cared to talk about men and women of middle age and average education might be seen together in corners earnestly discussing not the question whether Servia should have an outlet on the Adriatic or the possibilities of a British success in international polo contests but the more absorbing topic of the problematic Aztec or Nilotic origin of the Teresa MOTIV
Politics and patriotism are so boring and so out of date said a revered lady who had some pretensions to oracular utterance we are too cosmopolitan nowadays to be really moved by them
That is why one welcomes an intelligible production like Cousin Teresa that has a genuine message for one
One cant understand the message all at once of course but one felt from the very first that it was there
Ive been to see it eighteen times and Im going again tomorrow and on Thursday
One cant see it often enough
    It would be rather a popular move if we gave this Harrowcluff person a knighthood or something of the sort said the Minister reflectively
Which Harrowcluff
asked his secretary
Which
There is only one isnt there
said the Minister the Cousin Teresa man of course
I think every one would be pleased if we knighted him
Yes you can put him down on the list of certainties  under the letter L The letter L said the secretary who was new to his job does that stand for Liberalism or liberality
Most of the recipients of Ministerial favour were expected to qualify in both of those subjects
Literature explained the Minister
And thus after a fashion Colonel Harrowcluffs expectation of seeing his sons name in the list of Honours was gratified
THE YARKAND MANNER SIR LULWORTH QUAYNE was making a leisurely progress through the Zoological Societys Gardens in company with his nephew recently returned from Mexico
The latter was interested in comparing and contrasting allied types of animals occurring in the North American and Old World fauna
One of the most remarkable things in the wanderings of species he observed is the sudden impulse to trek and migrate that breaks out now and again for no apparent reason in communities of hitherto stayathome animals
In human affairs the same phenomenon is occasionally noticeable said Sir Lulworth perhaps the most striking instance of it occurred in this country while you were away in the wilds of Mexico
I mean the wander fever which suddenly displayed itself in the managing and editorial staffs of certain London newspapers
It began with the stampede of the entire staff of one of our most brilliant and enterprising weeklies to the banks of the Seine and the heights of Montmartre
The migration was a brief one but it heralded an era of restlessness in the Press world which lent quite a new meaning to the phrase newspaper circulation
Other editorial staffs were not slow to imitate the example that had been set them
Paris soon dropped out of fashion as being too near home Nurnberg Seville and Salonica became more favoured as planting out grounds for the personnel of not only weekly but daily papers as well
The localities were perhaps not always well chosen the fact of a leading organ of Evangelical thought being edited for two successive fortnights from Trouville and Monte Carlo was generally admitted to have been a mistake
And even when enterprising and adventurous editors took themselves and their staffs further afield there were some unavoidable clashings
For instance the SCRUTATOR SPORTING BLUFF and THE DAMSELS OWN PAPER all pitched on Khartoum for the same week
It was perhaps a desire to outdistance all possible competition that influenced the management of the DAILY INTELLIGENCER one of the most solid and respected organs of Liberal opinion in its decision to transfer its offices for three or four weeks from Fleet Street to Eastern Turkestan allowing of course a necessary margin of time for the journey there and back
This was in many respects the most remarkable of all the Press stampedes that were experienced at this time
There was no makebelieve about the undertaking proprietor manager editor subeditors leaderwriters principal reporters and so forth all took part in what was popularly alluded to as the DRANG NACH OSTEN an intelligent and efficient officeboy was all that was left in the deserted hive of editorial industry
That was doing things rather thoroughly wasnt it
said the nephew
Well you see said Sir Lulworth the migration idea was falling somewhat into disrepute from the half hearted manner in which it was occasionally carried out
You were not impressed by the information that such and such a paper was being edited and brought out at Lisbon or Innsbruck if you chanced to see the principal leader writer or the art editor lunching as usual at their accustomed restaurants
The DAILY INTELLIGENCER was determined to give no loophole for cavil at the genuineness of its pilgrimage and it must be admitted that to a certain extent the arrangements made for transmitting copy and carrying on the usual features of the paper during the long outward journey worked smoothly and well
The series of articles which commenced at Baku on What Cobdenism might do for the camel industry ranks among the best of the recent contributions to Free Trade literature while the views on foreign policy enunciated from a roof in Yarkand showed at least as much grasp of the international situation as those that had germinated within half a mile of Downing Street
Quite in keeping too with the older and better traditions of British journalism was the manner of the homecoming no bombast no personal advertisement no flamboyant interviews
Even a complimentary luncheon at the Voyagers Club was courteously declined
Indeed it began to be felt that the selfeffacement of the returned pressmen was being carried to a pedantic length
Foreman compositors advertisement clerks and other members of the non editorial staff who had of course taken no part in the great trek found it as impossible to get into direct communication with the editor and his satellites now that they had returned as when they had been excusably inaccessible in Central Asia
The sulky overworked officeboy who was the one connecting link between the editorial brain and the business departments of the paper sardonically explained the new aloofness as the Yarkand manner
Most of the reporters and subeditors seemed to have been dismissed in autocratic fashion since their return and new ones engaged by letter to these the editor and his immediate associates remained an unseen presence issuing its instructions solely through the medium of curt typewritten notes
Something mystic and Tibetan and forbidden had replaced the human bustle and democratic simplicity of premigration days and the same experience was encountered by those who made social overtures to the returned wanderers
The most brilliant hostess of Twentieth Century London flung the pearl of her hospitality into the unresponsive trough of the editorial letterbox it seemed as if nothing short of a Royal command would drag the hermitsouled REVENANTS from their selfimposed seclusion
People began to talk unkindly of the effect of high altitudes and Eastern atmosphere on minds and temperaments unused to such luxuries
The Yarkand manner was not popular
And the contents of the paper said the nephew did they show the influence of the new style
Ah
said Sir Lulworth that was the exciting thing
In home affairs social questions and the ordinary events of the day not much change was noticeable
A certain Oriental carelessness seemed to have crept into the editorial department and perhaps a note of lassitude not unnatural in the work of men who had returned from what had been a fairly arduous journey
The aforetime standard of excellence was scarcely maintained but at any rate the general lines of policy and outlook were not departed from
It was in the realm of foreign affairs that a startling change took place
Blunt forcible outspoken articles appeared couched in language which nearly turned the autumn manoeuvres of six important Powers into mobilisations
Whatever else the DAILY INTELLIGENCER had learned in the East it had not acquired the art of diplomatic ambiguity
The man in the street enjoyed the articles and bought the paper as he had never bought it before the men in Downing Street took a different view
The Foreign Secretary hitherto accounted a rather reticent man became positively garrulous in the course of perpetually disavowing the sentiments expressed in the DAILY INTELLIGENCERS leaders and then one day the Government came to the conclusion that something definite and drastic must be done
A deputation consisting of the Prime Minister the Foreign Secretary four leading financiers and a wellknown Nonconformist divine made its way to the offices of the paper
At the door leading to the editorial department the way was barred by a nervous but defiant officeboy 
You cant see the editor nor any of the staff he announced 
We insist on seeing the editor or some responsible person said the Prime Minister and the deputation forced its way in
The boy had spoken truly there was no one to be seen
In the whole suite of rooms there was no sign of human life 
Where is the editor
Or the foreign editor
Or the chief leaderwriter
Or anybody
In answer to the shower of questions the boy unlocked a drawer and produced a strangelooking envelope which bore a Khokand postmark and a date of some seven or eight months back
It contained a scrap of paper on which was written the following message  Entire party captured by brigand tribe on homeward journey
Quarter of million demanded as ransom but would probably take less
Inform Government relations and friends
There followed the signatures of the principal members of the party and instructions as to how and where the money was to be paid
The letter had been directed to the officeboyin charge who had quietly suppressed it
No one is a hero to ones own officeboy and he evidently considered that a quarter of a million was an unwarrantable outlay for such a doubtfully advantageous object as the repatriation of an errant newspaper staff
So he drew the editorial and other salaries forged what signatures were necessary engaged new reporters did what subediting he could and made as much use as possible of the large accumulation of special articles that was held in reserve for emergencies
The articles on foreign affairs were entirely his own composition
Of course the whole thing had to be kept as quiet as possible an interim staff pledged to secrecy was appointed to keep the paper going till the pining captives could be sought out ransomed and brought home in twos and threes to escape notice and gradually things were put back on their old footing
The articles on foreign affairs reverted to the wonted traditions of the paper
But interposed the nephew how on earth did the boy account to the relatives all those months for the nonappearance   That said Sir Lulworth was the most brilliant stroke of all
To the wife or nearest relative of each of the missing men he forwarded a letter copying the handwriting of the supposed writer as well as he could and making excuses about vile pens and ink in each letter he told the same story varying only the locality to the effect that the writer alone of the whole party was unable to tear himself away from the wild liberty and allurements of Eastern life and was going to spend several months roaming in some selected region
Many of the wives started off immediately in pursuit of their errant husbands and it took the Government a considerable time and much trouble to reclaim them from their fruitless quests along the banks of the Oxus the Gobi Desert the Orenburg steppe and other outlandish places
One of them I believe is still lost somewhere in the Tigris Valley
And the boy
Is still in journalism
THE BYZANTINE OMELETTE SOPHIE CHATTELMONKHEIM was a Socialist by conviction and a ChattelMonkheim by marriage
The particular member of that wealthy family whom she had married was rich even as his relatives counted riches
Sophie had very advanced and decided views as to the distribution of money it was a pleasing and fortunate circumstance that she also had the money
When she inveighed eloquently against the evils of capitalism at drawingroom meetings and Fabian conferences she was conscious of a comfortable feeling that the system with all its inequalities and iniquities would probably last her time
It is one of the consolations of middleaged reformers that the good they inculcate must live after them if it is to live at all
On a certain spring evening somewhere towards the dinnerhour Sophie sat tranquilly between her mirror and her maid undergoing the process of having her hair built into an elaborate reflection of the prevailing fashion
She was hedged round with a great peace the peace of one who has attained a desired end with much effort and perseverance and who has found it still eminently desirable in its attainment
The Duke of Syria had consented to come beneath her roof as a guest was even now installed beneath her roof and would shortly be sitting at her diningtable
As a good Socialist Sophie disapproved of social distinctions and derided the idea of a princely caste but if there were to be these artificial gradations of rank and dignity she was pleased and anxious to have an exalted specimen of an exalted order included in her houseparty
She was broadminded enough to love the sinner while hating the sin  not that she entertained any warm feeling of personal affection for the Duke of Syria who was a comparative stranger but still as Duke of Syria he was very very welcome beneath her roof
She could not have explained why but no one was likely to ask her for an explanation and most hostesses envied her
You must surpass yourself tonight Richardson she said complacently to her maid I must be looking my very best
We must all surpass ourselves
The maid said nothing but from the concentrated look in her eyes and the deft play of her fingers it was evident that she was beset with the ambition to surpass herself
A knock came at the door a quiet but peremptory knock as of some one who would not be denied
Go and see who it is said Sophie it may be something about the wine
Richardson held a hurried conference with an invisible messenger at the door when she returned there was noticeable a curious listlessness in place of her hitherto alert manner
What is it
asked Sophie
The household servants have downed tools madame said Richardson
Downed tools
exclaimed Sophie do you mean to say theyve gone on strike
Yes madame said Richardson adding the information Its Gaspare that the trouble is about
Gaspare
said Sophie wanderingly the emergency chef
The omelette specialist
Yes madame
Before he became an omelette specialist he was a valet and he was one of the strike breakers in the great strike at Lord Grimfords two years ago
As soon as the household staff here learned that you had engaged him they resolved to down tools as a protest
They havent got any grievance against you personally but they demand that Gaspare should be immediately dismissed
But protested Sophie he is the only man in England who understands how to make a Byzantine omelette
I engaged him specially for the Duke of Syrias visit and it would be impossible to replace him at short notice
I should have to send to Paris and the Duke loves Byzantine omelettes
It was the one thing we talked about coming from the station
He was one of the strikebreakers at Lord Grimfords reiterated Richardson
This is too awful said Sophie a strike of servants at a moment like this with the Duke of Syria staying in the house
Something must be done immediately
Quick finish my hair and Ill go and see what I can do to bring them round
I cant finish your hair madame said Richardson quietly but with immense decision
I belong to the union and I cant do another halfminutes work till the strike is settled
Im sorry to be disobliging
But this is inhuman
exclaimed Sophie tragically Ive always been a model mistress and Ive refused to employ any but union servants and this is the result
I cant finish my hair myself I dont know how to
What am I to do
Its wicked
Wicked is the word said Richardson Im a good Conservative and Ive no patience with this Socialist foolery asking your pardon
Its tyranny thats what it is all along the line but Ive my living to make same as other people and Ive got to belong to the union
I couldnt touch another hairpin without a strike permit not if you was to double my wages
The door burst open and Catherine Malsom raged into the room
Heres a nice affair she screamed a strike of household servants without a moments warning and Im left like this
I cant appear in public in this condition
After a very hasty scrutiny Sophie assured her that she could not
Have they all struck
she asked her maid
Not the kitchen staff said Richardson they belong to a different union
Dinner at least will be assured said Sophie that is something to be thankful for
Dinner
snorted Catherine what on earth is the good of dinner when none of us will be able to appear at it
Look at your hair  and look at me
or rather dont
I know its difficult to manage without a maid cant your husband be any help to you
asked Sophie despairingly
Henry
Hes in worse case than any of us
His man is the only person who really understands that ridiculous newfangled Turkish bath that he insists on taking with him everywhere
Surely he could do without a Turkish bath for one evening said Sophie I cant appear without hair but a Turkish bath is a luxury
My good woman said Catherine speaking with a fearful intensity Henry was in the bath when the strike started
In it do you understand
Hes there now
Cant he get out
He doesnt know how to
Every time he pulls the lever marked release he only releases hot steam
There are two kinds of steam in the bath bearable and scarcely bearable he has released them both
By this time Im probably a widow
I simply cant send away Gaspare wailed Sophie I should never be able to secure another omelette specialist
Any difficulty that I may experience in securing another husband is of course a trifle beneath anyones consideration said Catherine bitterly
Sophie capitulated
Go she said to Richardson and tell the Strike Committee or whoever are directing this affair that Gaspare is herewith dismissed
And ask Gaspare to see me presently in the library when I will pay him what is due to him and make what excuses I can and then fly back and finish my hair
Some half an hour later Sophie marshalled her guests in the Grand Salon preparatory to the formal march to the diningroom
Except that Henry Malsom was of the ripe raspberry tint that one sometimes sees at private theatricals representing the human complexion there was little outward sign among those assembled of the crisis that had just been encountered and surmounted
But the tension had been too stupefying while it lasted not to leave some mental effects behind it
Sophie talked at random to her illustrious guest and found her eyes straying with increasing frequency towards the great doors through which would presently come the blessed announcement that dinner was served
Now and again she glanced mirrorward at the reflection of her wonderfully coiffed hair as an insurance underwriter might gaze thankfully at an overdue vessel that had ridden safely into harbour in the wake of a devastating hurricane
Then the doors opened and the welcome figure of the butler entered the room
But he made no general announcement of a banquet in readiness and the doors closed behind him his message was for Sophie alone
There is no dinner madame he said gravely the kitchen staff have downed tools
Gaspare belongs to the Union of Cooks and Kitchen Employees and as soon as they heard of his summary dismissal at a moments notice they struck work
They demand his instant reinstatement and an apology to the union
I may add madame that they are very firm Ive been obliged even to hand back the dinner rolls that were already on the table
After the lapse of eighteen months Sophie Chattel Monkheim is beginning to go about again among her old haunts and associates but she still has to be very careful
The doctors will not let her attend anything at all exciting such as a drawingroom meeting or a Fabian conference it is doubtful indeed whether she wants to
THE FEAST OF NEMESIS ITS a good thing that Saint Valentines Day has dropped out of vogue said Mrs Thackenbury what with Christmas and New Year and Easter not to speak of birthdays there are quite enough remembrance days as it is
I tried to save myself trouble at Christmas by just sending flowers to all my friends but it wouldnt work Gertrude has eleven hothouses and about thirty gardeners so it would have been ridiculous to send flowers to her and Milly has just started a florists shop so it was equally out of the question there
The stress of having to decide in a hurry what to give to Gertrude and Milly just when I thought Id got the whole question nicely off my mind completely ruined my Christmas and then the awful monotony of the letters of thanks Thank you so much for your lovely flowers
It was so good of you to think of me
Of course in the majority of cases I hadnt thought about the recipients at all their names were down in my list of people who must not be left out
If I trusted to remembering them there would be some awful sins of omission
The trouble is said Clovis to his aunt all these days of intrusive remembrance harp so persistently on one aspect of human nature and entirely ignore the other that is why they become so perfunctory and artificial
At Christmas and New Year you are emboldened and encouraged by convention to send gushing messages of optimistic goodwill and servile affection to people whom you would scarcely ask to lunch unless some one else had failed you at the last moment if you are supping at a restaurant on New Years Eve you are permitted and expected to join hands and sing For Auld Lang Syne with strangers whom you have never seen before and never want to see again
But no licence is allowed in the opposite direction
Opposite direction what opposite direction
queried Mrs Thackenbury
There is no outlet for demonstrating your feelings towards people whom you simply loathe
That is really the crying need of our modern civilisation
Just think how jolly it would be if a recognised day were set apart for the paying off of old scores and grudges a day when one could lay oneself out to be gracefully vindictive to a carefully treasured list of people who must not be let off
I remember when I was at a private school we had one day the last Monday of the term I think it was consecrated to the settlement of feuds and grudges of course we did not appreciate it as much as it deserved because after all any day of the term could be used for that purpose
Still if one had chastised a smaller boy for being cheeky weeks before one was always permitted on that day to recall the episode to his memory by chastising him again
That is what the French call reconstructing the crime
I should call it reconstructing the punishment said Mrs Thackenbury and anyhow I dont see how you could introduce a system of primitive schoolboy vengeance into civilised adult life
We havent outgrown our passions but we are supposed to have learned how to keep them within strictly decorous limits
Of course the thing would have to be done furtively and politely said Clovis the charm of it would be that it would never be perfunctory like the other thing
Now for instance you say to yourself I must show the Webleys some attention at Christmas they were kind to dear Bertie at Bournemouth and you send them a calendar and daily for six days after Christmas the male Webley asks the female Webley if she has remembered to thank you for the calendar you sent them
Well transplant that idea to the other and more human side of your nature and say to yourself Next Thursday is Nemesis Day what on earth can I do to those odious people next door who made such an absurd fuss when Ping Yang bit their youngest child
Then youd get up awfully early on the allotted day and climb over into their garden and dig for truffles on their tennis court with a good gardening fork choosing of course that part of the court that was screened from observation by the laurel bushes
You wouldnt find any truffles but you would find a great peace such as no amount of presentgiving could ever bestow
I shouldnt said Mrs Thackenbury though her air of protest sounded a bit forced I should feel rather a worm for doing such a thing
You exaggerate the power of upheaval which a worm would be able to bring into play in the limited time available said Clovis if you put in a strenuous ten minutes with a really useful fork the result ought to suggest the operations of an unusually masterful mole or a badger in a hurry
They might guess I had done it said Mrs Thackenbury
Of course they would said Clovis that would be half the satisfaction of the thing just as you like people at Christmas to know what presents or cards youve sent them
The thing would be much easier to manage of course when you were on outwardly friendly terms with the object of your dislike
That greedy little Agnes Blaik for instance who thinks of nothing but her food it would be quite simple to ask her to a picnic in some wild woodland spot and lose her just before lunch was served when you found her again every morsel of food could have been eaten up
It would require no ordinary human strategy to lose Agnes Blaik when luncheon was imminent in fact I dont believe it could be done
Then have all the other guests people whom you dislike and lose the luncheon
It could have been sent by accident in the wrong direction
It would be a ghastly picnic said Mrs Thackenbury
For them but not for you said Clovis you would have had an early and comforting lunch before you started and you could improve the occasion by mentioning in detail the items of the missing banquet  the lobster Newburg and the egg mayonnaise and the curry that was to have been heated in a chafingdish
Agnes Blaik would be delirious long before you got to the list of wines and in the long interval of waiting before they had quite abandoned hope of the lunch turning up you could induce them to play silly games such as that idiotic one of the Lord Mayors dinnerparty in which every one has to choose the name of a dish and do something futile when it is called out
In this case they would probably burst into tears when their dish is mentioned
It would be a heavenly picnic
Mrs Thackenbury was silent for a moment she was probably making a mental list of the people she would like to invite to the Duke Humphrey picnic
Presently she asked And that odious young man Waldo Plubley who is always coddling himself  have you thought of anything that one could do to him
Evidently she was beginning to see the possibilities of Nemesis Day
If there was anything like a general observance of the festival said Clovis Waldo would be in such demand that you would have to bespeak him weeks beforehand and even then if there were an east wind blowing or a cloud or two in the sky he might be too careful of his precious self to come out
It would be rather jolly if you could lure him into a hammock in the orchard just near the spot where there is a wasps nest every summer
A comfortable hammock on a warm afternoon would appeal to his indolent tastes and then when he was getting drowsy a lighted fusee thrown into the nest would bring the wasps out in an indignant mass and they would soon find a home away from home on Waldos fat body
It takes some doing to get out of a hammock in a hurry
They might sting him to death protested Mrs Thackenbury
Waldo is one of those people who would be enormously improved by death said Clovis but if you didnt want to go as far as that you could have some wet straw ready to hand and set it alight under the hammock at the same time that the fusee was thrown into the nest the smoke would keep all but the most militant of the wasps just outside the stinging line and as long as Waldo remained within its protection he would escape serious damage and could be eventually restored to his mother kippered all over and swollen in places but still perfectly recognisable
His mother would be my enemy for life said Mrs Thackenbury
That would be one greeting less to exchange at Christmas said Clovis
THE DREAMER IT was the season of sales
The august establishment of Walpurgis and Nettlepink had lowered its prices for an entire week as a concession to trade observances much as an Archduchess might protestingly contract an attack of influenza for the unsatisfactory reason that influenza was locally prevalent
Adela Chemping who considered herself in some measure superior to the allurements of an ordinary bargain sale made a point of attending the reduction week at Walpurgis and Nettlepinks
Im not a bargain hunter she said but I like to go where bargains are
Which showed that beneath her surface strength of character there flowed a gracious undercurrent of human weakness
With a view to providing herself with a male escort Mrs Chemping had invited her youngest nephew to accompany her on the first day of the shopping expedition throwing in the additional allurement of a cinematograph theatre and the prospect of light refreshment
As Cyprian was not yet eighteen she hoped he might not have reached that stage in masculine development when parcelcarrying is looked on as a thing abhorrent
Meet me just outside the floral department she wrote to him and dont be a moment later than eleven
Cyprian was a boy who carried with him through early life the wondering look of a dreamer the eyes of one who sees things that are not visible to ordinary mortals and invests the commonplace things of this world with qualities unsuspected by plainer folk  the eyes of a poet or a house agent
He was quietly dressed  that sartorial quietude which frequently accompanies early adolescence and is usually attributed by novelwriters to the influence of a widowed mother
His hair was brushed back in a smoothness as of ribbon seaweed and seamed with a narrow furrow that scarcely aimed at being a parting
His aunt particularly noted this item of his toilet when they met at the appointed rendezvous because he was standing waiting for her bareheaded
Where is your hat
she asked
I didnt bring one with me he replied
Adela Chemping was slightly scandalised
You are not going to be what they call a Nut are you
she inquired with some anxiety partly with the idea that a Nut would be an extravagance which her sisters small household would scarcely be justified in incurring partly perhaps with the instinctive apprehension that a Nut even in its embryo stage would refuse to carry parcels
Cyprian looked at her with his wondering dreamy eyes
I didnt bring a hat he said because it is such a nuisance when one is shopping I mean it is so awkward if one meets anyone one knows and has to take ones hat off when ones hands are full of parcels
If one hasnt got a hat on one cant take it off
Mrs Chemping sighed with great relief her worst fear had been laid at rest
It is more orthodox to wear a hat she observed and then turned her attention briskly to the business in hand
We will go first to the tablelinen counter she said leading the way in that direction I should like to look at some napkins
The wondering look deepened in Cyprians eyes as he followed his aunt he belonged to a generation that is supposed to be overfond of the role of mere spectator but looking at napkins that one did not mean to buy was a pleasure beyond his comprehension
Mrs Chemping held one or two napkins up to the light and stared fixedly at them as though she half expected to find some revolutionary cypher written on them in scarcely visible ink then she suddenly broke away in the direction of the glassware department
Millicent asked me to get her a couple of decanters if there were any going really cheap she explained on the way and I really do want a salad bowl
I can come back to the napkins later on
She handled and scrutinised a large number of decanters and a long series of salad bowls and finally bought seven chrysanthemum vases
No one uses that kind of vase nowadays she informed Cyprian but they will do for presents next Christmas
Two sunshades that were marked down to a price that Mrs Chemping considered absurdly cheap were added to her purchases
One of them will do for Ruth Colson she is going out to the Malay States and a sunshade will always be useful there
And I must get her some thin writing paper
It takes up no room in ones baggage
Mrs Chemping bought stacks of writing paper it was so cheap and it went so flat in a trunk or portmanteau
She also bought a few envelopes  envelopes somehow seemed rather an extragavance compared with notepaper
Do you think Ruth will like blue or grey paper
she asked Cyprian
Grey said Cyprian who had never met the lady in question
Have you any mauve notepaper of this quality
Adela asked the assistant
We havent any mauve said the assistant but weve two shades of green and a darker shade of grey
Mrs Chemping inspected the greens and the darker grey and chose the blue
Now we can have some lunch she said
Cyprian behaved in an exemplary fashion in the refreshment department and cheerfully accepted a fish cake and a mince pie and a small cup of coffee as adequate restoratives after two hours of concentrated shopping
He was adamant however in resisting his aunts suggestion that a hat should be bought for him at the counter where mens headwear was being disposed of at temptingly reduced prices
Ive got as many hats as I want at home he said and besides it rumples ones hair so trying them on
Perhaps he was going to develop into a Nut after all
It was a disquieting symptom that he left all the parcels in charge of the cloakroom attendant
We shall be getting more parcels presently he said so we need not collect these till we have finished our shopping
His aunt was doubtfully appeased some of the pleasure and excitement of a shopping expedition seemed to evaporate when one was deprived of immediate personal contact with ones purchases
Im going to look at those napkins again she said as they descended the stairs to the ground floor
You need not come she added as the dreaming look in the boys eyes changed for a moment into one of mute protest you can meet me afterwards in the cutlery department Ive just remembered that I havent a corkscrew in the house that can be depended on
Cyprian was not to be found in the cutlery department when his aunt in due course arrived there but in the crush and bustle of anxious shoppers and busy attendants it was an easy matter to miss anyone
It was in the leather goods department some quarter of an hour later that Adela Chemping caught sight of her nephew separated from her by a rampart of suitcases and portmanteaux and hemmed in by the jostling crush of human beings that now invaded every corner of the great shopping emporium
She was just in time to witness a pardonable but rather embarrassing mistake on the part of a lady who had wriggled her way with unstayable determination towards the bareheaded Cyprian and was now breathlessly demanding the sale price of a handbag which had taken her fancy
There now exclaimed Adela to herself she takes him for one of the shop assistants because he hasnt got a hat on
I wonder it hasnt happened before
Perhaps it had
Cyprian at any rate seemed neither startled nor embarrassed by the error into which the good lady had fallen
Examining the ticket on the bag he announced in a clear dispassionate voice Black seal thirtyfour shillings marked down to twentyeight
As a matter of fact we are clearing them out at a special reduction price of twentysix shillings
They are going off rather fast
Ill take it said the lady eagerly digging some coins out of her purse
Will you take it as it is
asked Cyprian it will be a matter of a few minutes to get it wrapped up there is such a crush
Never mind Ill take it as it is said the purchaser clutching her treasure and counting the money into Cyprians palm
Several kind strangers helped Adela into the open air
Its the crush and the heat said one sympathiser to another its enough to turn anyone giddy
When she next came across Cyprian he was standing in the crowd that pushed and jostled around the counters of the book department
The dream look was deeper than ever in his eyes
He had just sold two books of devotion to an elderly Canon
THE QUINCE TREE IVE just been to see old Betsy Mullen announced Vera to her aunt Mrs Bebberly Cumble she seems in rather a bad way about her rent
She owes about fifteen weeks of it and says she doesnt know where any of it is to come from
Betsy Mullen always is in difficulties with her rent and the more people help her with it the less she troubles about it said the aunt
I certainly am not going to assist her any more
The fact is she will have to go into a smaller and cheaper cottage there are several to be had at the other end of the village for half the rent that she is paying or supposed to be paying now
I told her a year ago that she ought to move
But she wouldnt get such a nice garden anywhere else protested Vera and theres such a jolly quince tree in the corner
I dont suppose theres another quince tree in the whole parish
And she never makes any quince jam I think to have a quince tree and not to make quince jam shows such strength of character
Oh she cant possibly move away from that garden
When one is sixteen said Mrs Bebberly Cumble severely one talks of things being impossible which are merely uncongenial
It is not only possible but it is desirable that Betsy Mullen should move into smaller quarters she has scarcely enough furniture to fill that big cottage
As far as value goes said Vera after a short pause there is more in Betsys cottage than in any other house for miles round
Nonsense said the aunt she parted with whatever old china ware she had long ago
Im not talking about anything that belongs to Betsy herself said Vera darkly but of course you dont know what I know and I dont suppose I ought to tell you
You must tell me at once exclaimed the aunt her senses leaping into alertness like those of a terrier suddenly exchanging a bored drowsiness for the lively anticipation of an immediate rat hunt
Im perfectly certain that I oughtnt to tell you anything about it said Vera but then I often do things that I oughtnt to do
I should be the last person to suggest that you should do anything that you ought not to do to   began Mrs Bebberly Cumble impressively
And I am always swayed by the last person who speaks to me admitted Vera so Ill do what I ought not to do and tell you
Mrs Bebberley Cumble thrust a very pardonable sense of exasperation into the background of her mind and demanded impatiently What is there in Betsy Mullens cottage that you are making such a fuss about
Its hardly fair to say that IVE made a fuss about it said Vera this is the first time Ive mentioned the matter but theres been no end of trouble and mystery and newspaper speculation about it
Its rather amusing to think of the columns of conjecture in the Press and the police and detectives hunting about everywhere at home and abroad and all the while that innocentlooking little cottage has held the secret
You dont mean to say its the Louvre picture La Something or other the woman with the smile that disappeared about two years ago
exclaimed the aunt with rising excitement
Oh no not that said Vera but something quite as important and just as mysterious  if anything rather more scandalous
Not the Dublin  
Vera nodded
The whole jolly lot of them
In Betsys cottage
Incredible
Of course Betsy hasnt an idea as to what they are said Vera she just knows that they are something valuable and that she must keep quiet about them
I found out quite by accident what they were and how they came to be there
You see the people who had them were at their wits end to know where to stow them away for safe keeping and some one who was motoring through the village was struck by the snug loneliness of the cottage and thought it would be just the thing
Mrs Lamper arranged the matter with Betsy and smuggled the things in
Mrs
Lamper
Yes she does a lot of district visiting you know
I am quite aware that she takes soup and flannel and improving literature to the poorer cottagers said Mrs Bebberly Cumble but that is hardly the same sort of thing as disposing of stolen goods and she must have known something about their history anyone who reads the papers even casually must have been aware of the theft and I should think the things were not hard to recognise
Mrs Lamper has always had the reputation of being a very conscientious woman
Of course she was screening some one else said Vera
A remarkable feature of the affair is the extraordinary number of quite respectable people who have involved themselves in its meshes by trying to shield others
You would be really astonished if you knew some of the names of the individuals mixed up in it and I dont suppose a tithe of them know who the original culprits were and now Ive got you entangled in the mess by letting you into the secret of the cottage
You most certainly have not entangled me said Mrs Bebberly Cumble indignantly
I have no intention of shielding anybody
The police must know about it at once a theft is a theft whoever is involved
If respectable people choose to turn themselves into receivers and disposers of stolen goods well theyve ceased to be respectable thats all
I shall telephone immediately   Oh aunt said Vera reproachfully it would break the poor Canons heart if Cuthbert were to be involved in a scandal of this sort
You know it would
Cuthbert involved
How can you say such things when you know how much we all think of him
Of course I know you think a lot of him and that hes engaged to marry Beatrice and that it will be a frightfully good match and that hes your ideal of what a soninlaw ought to be
All the same it was Cuthberts idea to stow the things away in the cottage and it was his motor that brought them
He was only doing it to help his friend Pegginson you know  the Quaker man who is always agitating for a smaller Navy
I forget how he got involved in it
I warned you that there were lots of quite respectable people mixed up in it didnt I
Thats what I meant when I said it would be impossible for old Betsy to leave the cottage the things take up a good bit of room and she couldnt go carrying them about with her other goods and chattels without attracting notice
Of course if she were to fall ill and die it would be equally unfortunate
Her mother lived to be over ninety she tells me so with due care and an absence of worry she ought to last for another dozen years at least
By that time perhaps some other arrangements will have been made for disposing of the wretched things
I shall speak to Cuthbert about it  after the wedding said Mrs Bebberly Cumble
The wedding isnt till next year said Vera in recounting the story to her best girl friend and meanwhile old Betsy is living rent free with soup twice a week and my aunts doctor to see her whenever she has a finger ache
But how on earth did you get to know about it all
asked her friend in admiring wonder
It was a mystery   said Vera
Of course it was a mystery a mystery that baffled everybody
What beats me is how you found out   Oh about the jewels
I invented that part explained Vera I mean the mystery was where old Betsys arrears of rent were to come from and she would have hated leaving that jolly quince tree
THE FORBIDDEN BUZZARDS IS matchmaking at all in your line
Hugo Peterby asked the question with a certain amount of personal interest
I dont specialise in it said Clovis its all right while youre doing it but the aftereffects are sometimes so disconcerting  the mute reproachful looks of the people youve aided and abetted in matrimonial experiments
Its as bad as selling a man a horse with half a dozen latent vices and watching him discover them piecemeal in the course of the hunting season
I suppose youre thinking of the Coulterneb girl
Shes certainly jolly and quite all right as far as looks go and I believe a certain amount of money adheres to her
What I dont see is how you will ever manage to propose to her
In all the time Ive known her I dont remember her to have stopped talking for three consecutive minutes
Youll have to race her six times round the grass paddock for a bet and then blurt your proposal out before shes got her wind back
The paddock is laid up for hay but if youre really in love with her you wont let a consideration of that sort stop you especially as its not your hay
I think I could manage the proposing part right enough said Hugo if I could count on being left alone with her for four or five hours
The trouble is that Im not likely to get anything like that amount of grace
That fellow Lanner is showing signs of interesting himself in the same quarter
Hes quite heartbreakingly rich and is rather a swell in his way in fact our hostess is obviously a bit flattered at having him here
If she gets wind of the fact that hes inclined to be attracted by Betty Coulterneb shell think it a splendid match and throw them into each others arms all day long and then where will my opportunities come in
My one anxiety is to keep him out of the girls way as much as possible and if you could help me   If you want me to trot Lanner round the countryside inspecting alleged Roman remains and studying local methods of bee culture and crop raising Im afraid I cant oblige you said Clovis
You see hes taken something like an aversion to me since the other night in the smokingroom
What happened in the smokingroom
He trotted out some wellworn chestnut as the latest thing in good stories and I remarked quite innocently that I never could remember whether it was George II
or James II
who was so fond of that particular story and now he regards me with politely draped dislike
Ill do my best for you if the opportunity arises but it will have to be in a roundabout impersonal manner
    Its so nice having Mr Lanner here confided Mrs Olston to Clovis the next afternoon hes always been engaged when Ive asked him before
Such a nice man he really ought to be married to some nice girl
Between you and me I have an idea that he came down here for a certain reason
Ive had much the same idea said Clovis lowering his voice in fact Im almost certain of it
You mean hes attracted by   began Mrs Olston eagerly
I mean hes here for what he can get said Clovis
For what he can GET
said the hostess with a touch of indignation in her voice what do you mean
Hes a very rich man
What should he want to get here
He has one ruling passion said Clovis and theres something he can get here that is not to be had for love nor for money anywhere else in the country as far as I know
But what
Whatever do you mean
What is his ruling passion
Eggcollecting said Clovis
He has agents all over the world getting rare eggs for him and his collection is one of the finest in Europe but his great ambition is to collect his treasures personally
He stops at no expense nor trouble to achieve that end
Good heavens
The buzzards the roughlegged buzzards
exclaimed Mrs Olston you dont think hes going to raid their nest
What do you think yourself
asked Clovis the only pair of roughlegged buzzards known to breed in this country are nesting in your woods
Very few people know about them but as a member of the league for protecting rare birds that information would be at his disposal
I came down in the train with him and I noticed that a bulky volume of Dressers Birds of Europe was one of the requisites that he had packed in his travellingkit
It was the volume dealing with shortwinged hawks and buzzards
Clovis believed that if a lie was worth telling it was worth telling well
This is appalling said Mrs Olston my husband would never forgive me if anything happened to those birds
Theyve been seen about the woods for the last year or two but this is the first time theyve nested
As you say they are almost the only pair known to be breeding in the whole of Great Britain and now their nest is going to be harried by a guest staying under my roof
I must do something to stop it
Do you think if I appealed to him   Clovis laughed
There is a story going about which I fancy is true in most of its details of something that happened not long ago somewhere on the coast of the Sea of Marmora in which our friend had a hand
A Syrian nightjar or some such bird was known to be breeding in the olive gardens of a rich Armenian who for some reason or other wouldnt allow Lanner to go in and take the eggs though he offered cash down for the permission
The Armenian was found beaten nearly to death a day or two later and his fences levelled
It was assumed to be a case of Mussulman aggression and noted as such in all the Consular reports but the eggs are in the Lanner collection
No I dont think I should appeal to his better feelings if I were you
I must do something said Mrs Olston tearfully my husbands parting words when he went off to Norway were an injunction to see that those birds were not disturbed and hes asked about them every time hes written
Do suggest something
I was going to suggest picketing said Clovis
Picketing
You mean setting guards round the birds
No round Lanner
He cant find his way through those woods by night and you could arrange that you or Evelyn or Jack or the German governess should be by his side in relays all day long
A fellow guest he could get rid of but he couldnt very well shake off members of the household and even the most determined collector would hardly go climbing after forbidden buzzards eggs with a German governess hanging round his neck so to speak
Lanner who had been lazily watching for an opportunity for prosecuting his courtship of the Coulterneb girl found presently that his chances of getting her to himself for ten minutes even were non existent
If the girl was ever alone he never was
His hostess had changed suddenly as far as he was concerned from the desirable type that lets her guests do nothing in the way that best pleases them to the sort that drags them over the ground like so many harrows
She showed him the herb garden and the greenhouses the village church some watercolour sketches that her sister had done in Corsica and the place where it was hoped that celery would grow later in the year
He was shown all the Aylesbury ducklings and the row of wooden hives where there would have been bees if there had not been bee disease
He was also taken to the end of a long lane and shown a distant mound whereon local tradition reported that the Danes had once pitched a camp
And when his hostess had to desert him temporarily for other duties he would find Evelyn walking solemnly by his side
Evelyn was fourteen and talked chiefly about good and evil and of how much one might accomplish in the way of regenerating the world if one was thoroughly determined to do ones utmost
It was generally rather a relief when she was displaced by Jack who was nine years old and talked exclusively about the Balkan War without throwing any fresh light on its political or military history
The German governess told Lanner more about Schiller than he had ever heard in his life about any one person it was perhaps his own fault for having told her that he was not interested in Goethe
When the governess went off picket duty the hostess was again on hand with a nottobegainsaid invitation to visit the cottage of an old woman who remembered Charles James Fox the woman had been dead for two or three years but the cottage was still there
Lanner was called back to town earlier than he had originally intended
Hugo did not bring off his affair with Betty Coulterneb
Whether she refused him or whether as was more generally supposed he did not get a chance of saying three consecutive words has never been exactly ascertained
Anyhow she is still the jolly Coulterneb girl
The buzzards successfully reared two young ones which were shot by a local hairdresser
THE STAKE RONNIE is a great trial to me said Mrs Attray plaintively
Only eighteen years old last February and already a confirmed gambler
I am sure I dont know where he inherits it from his father never touched cards and you know how little I play  a game of bridge on Wednesday afternoons in the winter for threepence a hundred and even that I shouldnt do if it wasnt that Edith always wants a fourth and would be certain to ask that detestable Jenkinham woman if she couldnt get me
I would much rather sit and talk any day than play bridge cards are such a waste of time I think
But as to Ronnie bridge and baccarat and pokerpatience are positively all that he thinks about
Of course Ive done my best to stop it Ive asked the Norridrums not to let him play cards when hes over there but you might as well ask the Atlantic Ocean to keep quiet for a crossing as expect them to bother about a mothers natural anxieties
Why do you let him go there
asked Eleanor Saxelby
My dear said Mrs Attray I dont want to offend them
After all they are my landlords and I have to look to them for anything I want done about the place they were very accommodating about the new roof for the orchid house
And they lend me one of their cars when mine is out of order you know how often it gets out of order
I dont know how often said Eleanor but it must happen very frequently
Whenever I want you to take me anywhere in your car I am always told that there is something wrong with it or else that the chauffeur has got neuralgia and you dont like to ask him to go out
He suffers quite a lot from neuralgia said Mrs Attray hastily
Anyhow she continued you can understand that I dont want to offend the Norridrums
Their household is the most rackety one in the county and I believe no one ever knows to an hour or two when any particular meal will appear on the table or what it will consist of when it does appear
Eleanor Saxelby shuddered
She liked her meals to be of regular occurrence and assured proportions
Still pursued Mrs Attray whatever their own home life may be as landlords and neighbours they are considerate and obliging so I dont want to quarrel with them
Besides if Ronnie didnt play cards there hed be playing somewhere else
Not if you were firm with him said Eleanor I believe in being firm
Firm
I am firm exclaimed Mrs Attray I am more than firm  I am farseeing
Ive done everything I can think of to prevent Ronnie from playing for money
Ive stopped his allowance for the rest of the year so he cant even gamble on credit and Ive subscribed a lump sum to the church offertory in his name instead of giving him instalments of small silver to put in the bag on Sundays
I wouldnt even let him have the money to tip the hunt servants with but sent it by postal order
He was furiously sulky about it but I reminded him of what happened to the ten shillings that I gave him for the Young Mens Endeavour League SelfDenial Week
 What did happen to it
asked Eleanor
Well Ronnie did some preliminary endeavouring with it on his own account in connection with the Grand National
If it had come off as he expressed it he would have given the League twentyfive shillings and netted a comfortable commission for himself as it was that ten shillings was one of the things the League had to deny itself
Since then Ive been careful not to let him have a penny piece in his hands
Hell get round that in some way said Eleanor with quiet conviction hell sell things
My dear hes done all that is to be done in that direction already
Hes got rid of his wristwatch and his hunting flask and both his cigarette cases and I shouldnt be surprised if hes wearing imitationgold sleeve links instead of those his Aunt Rhoda gave him on his seventeenth birthday
He cant sell his clothes of course except his winter overcoat and Ive locked that up in the camphor cupboard on the pretext of preserving it from moth
I really dont see what else he can raise money on
I consider that Ive been both firm and far seeing
Has he been at the Norridrums lately
asked Eleanor
He was there yesterday afternoon and stayed to dinner said Mrs Attray
I dont quite know when he came home but I fancy it was late
Then depend on it he was gambling said Eleanor with the assured air of one who has few ideas and makes the most of them 
Late hours in the country always mean gambling
He cant gamble if he has no money and no chance of getting any argued Mrs Attray even if one plays for small stakes one must have a decent prospect of paying ones losses
He may have sold some of the Amherst pheasant chicks suggested Eleanor they would fetch about ten or twelve shillings each I daresay
Ronnie wouldnt do such a thing said Mrs Attray and anyhow I went and counted them this morning and theyre all there
No she continued with the quiet satisfaction that comes from a sense of painstaking and merited achievement I fancy that Ronnie had to content himself with the role of onlooker last night as far as the cardtable was concerned
Is that clock right
asked Eleanor whose eyes had been straying restlessly towards the mantelpiece for some little time lunch is usually so punctual in your establishment
Three minutes past the halfhour exclaimed Mrs Attray cook must be preparing something unusually sumptuous in your honour
I am not in the secret Ive been out all the morning you know
Eleanor smiled forgivingly
A special effort by Mrs Attrays cook was worth waiting a few minutes for
As a matter of fact the luncheon fare when it made its tardy appearance was distinctly unworthy of the reputation which the justlytreasured cook had built up for herself
The soup alone would have sufficed to cast a gloom over any meal that it had inaugurated and it was not redeemed by anything that followed
Eleanor said little but when she spoke there was a hint of tears in her voice that was far more eloquent than outspoken denunciation would have been and even the insouciant Ronald showed traces of depression when he tasted the rognons Saltikoff
Not quite the best luncheon Ive enjoyed in your house said Eleanor at last when her final hope had flickered out with the savoury
My dear its the worst meal Ive sat down to for years said her hostess that last dish tasted principally of red pepper and wet toast
Im awfully sorry
Is anything the matter in the kitchen Pellin
she asked of the attendant maid
Well maam the new cook hadnt hardly time to see to things properly coming in so sudden   commenced Pellin by way of explanation
The new cook
screamed Mrs Attray
Colonel Norridrums cook maam said Pellin
What on earth do you mean
What is Colonel Norridrums cook doing in my kitchen  and where is my cook
Perhaps I can explain better than Pellin can said Ronald hurriedly the fact is I was dining at the Norridrums yesterday and they were wishing they had a swell cook like yours just for today and tomorrow while theyve got some gourmet staying with them their own cook is no earthly good  well youve seen what she turns out when shes at all flurried
So I thought it would be rather sporting to play them at baccarat for the loan of our cook against a money stake and I lost thats all
I have had rotten luck at baccarat all this year
The remainder of his explanation of how he had assured the cooks that the temporary transfer had his mothers sanction and had smuggled the one out and the other in during the maternal absence was drowned in the outcry of scandalised upbraiding
If I had sold the woman into slavery there couldnt have been a bigger fuss about it he confided afterwards to Bertie Norridrum and Eleanor Saxelby raged and ramped the louder of the two
I tell you what Ill bet you two of the Amherst pheasants to five shillings that she refuses to have me as a partner at the croquet tournament
Were drawn together you know
This time he won his bet
CLOVIS ON PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES MARION EGGELBY sat talking to Clovis on the only subject that she ever willingly talked about  her offspring and their varied perfections and accomplishments
Clovis was not in what could be called a receptive mood the younger generation of Eggelby depicted in the glowing improbable colours of parent impressionism aroused in him no enthusiasm
Mrs Eggelby on the other hand was furnished with enthusiasm enough for two
You would like Eric she said argumentatively rather than hopefully
Clovis had intimated very unmistakably that he was unlikely to care extravagantly for either Amy or Willie
Yes I feel sure you would like Eric
Every one takes to him at once
You know he always reminds me of that famous picture of the youthful David  I forget who its by but its very well known
That would be sufficient to set me against him if I saw much of him said Clovis
Just imagine at auction bridge for instance when one was trying to concentrate ones mind on what ones partners original declaration had been and to remember what suits ones opponents had originally discarded what it would be like to have some one persistently reminding one of a picture of the youthful David
It would be simply maddening
If Eric did that I should detest him
Eric doesnt play bridge said Mrs Eggelby with dignity
Doesnt he
asked Clovis why not
None of my children have been brought up to play card games said Mrs Eggelby draughts and halma and those sorts of games I encourage
Eric is considered quite a wonderful draughtsplayer
You are strewing dreadful risks in the path of your family said Clovis a friend of mine who is a prison chaplain told me that among the worst criminal cases that have come under his notice men condemned to death or to long periods of penal servitude there was not a single bridgeplayer
On the other hand he knew at least two expert draughtsplayers among them
I really dont see what my boys have got to do with the criminal classes said Mrs Eggelby resentfully
They have been most carefully brought up I can assure you that
That shows that you were nervous as to how they would turn out said Clovis
Now my mother never bothered about bringing me up
She just saw to it that I got whacked at decent intervals and was taught the difference between right and wrong there is some difference you know but Ive forgotten what it is
Forgotten the difference between right and wrong
exclaimed Mrs Eggelby
Well you see I took up natural history and a whole lot of other subjects at the same time and one cant remember everything can one
I used to know the difference between the Sardinian dormouse and the ordinary kind and whether the wryneck arrives at our shores earlier than the cuckoo or the other way round and how long the walrus takes in growing to maturity I daresay you knew all those sorts of things once but I bet youve forgotten them
Those things are not important said Mrs Eggelby but   The fact that weve both forgotten them proves that they are important said Clovis you must have noticed that its always the important things that one forgets while the trivial unnecessary facts of life stick in ones memory
Theres my cousin Editha Clubberley for instance I can never forget that her birthday is on the 12th of October
Its a matter of utter indifference to me on what date her birthday falls or whether she was born at all either fact seems to me absolutely trivial or unnecessary  Ive heaps of other cousins to go on with
On the other hand when Im staying with Hildegarde Shrubley I can never remember the important circumstance whether her first husband got his unenviable reputation on the Turf or the Stock Exchange and that uncertainty rules Sport and Finance out of the conversation at once
One can never mention travel either because her second husband had to live permanently abroad
Mrs Shrubley and I move in very different circles said Mrs Eggelby stiffly
No one who knows Hildegarde could possibly accuse her of moving in a circle said Clovis her view of life seems to be a nonstop run with an inexhaustible supply of petrol
If she can get some one else to pay for the petrol so much the better
I dont mind confessing to you that she has taught me more than any other woman I can think of
What kind of knowledge
demanded Mrs Eggelby with the air a jury might collectively wear when finding a verdict without leaving the box
Well among other things shes introduced me to at least four different ways of cooking lobster said Clovis gratefully
That of course wouldnt appeal to you people who abstain from the pleasures of the card table never really appreciate the finer possibilities of the diningtable
I suppose their powers of enlightened enjoyment get atrophied from disuse
An aunt of mine was very ill after eating a lobster said Mrs Eggelby
I daresay if we knew more of her history we should find out that shed often been ill before eating the lobster
Arent you concealing the fact that shed had measles and influenza and nervous headache and hysteria and other things that aunts do have long before she ate the lobster
Aunts that have never known a days illness are very rare in fact I dont personally know of any
Of course if she ate it as a child of two weeks old it might have been her first illness  and her last
But if that was the case I think you should have said so
I must be going said Mrs Eggelby in a tone which had been thoroughly sterilised of even perfunctory regret
Clovis rose with an air of graceful reluctance
I have so enjoyed our little talk about Eric he said I quite look forward to meeting him some day
Goodbye said Mrs Eggelby frostily the supplementary remark which she made at the back of her throat was  Ill take care that you never shall
A HOLIDAY TASK KENELM JERTON entered the dininghall of the Golden Galleon Hotel in the full crush of the luncheon hour
Nearly every seat was occupied and small additional tables had been brought in where floor space permitted to accommodate latecomers with the result that many of the tables were almost touching each other
Jerton was beckoned by a waiter to the only vacant table that was discernible and took his seat with the uncomfortable and wholly groundless idea that nearly every one in the room was staring at him
He was a youngish man of ordinary appearance quiet of dress and unobtrusive of manner and he could never wholly rid himself of the idea that a fierce light of public scrutiny beat on him as though he had been a notability or a supernut
After he had ordered his lunch there came the unavoidable interval of waiting with nothing to do but to stare at the flower vase on his table and to be stared at in imagination by several flappers some maturer beings of the same sex and a satiricallooking Jew
In order to carry off the situation with some appearance of unconcern he became spuriously interested in the contents of the flowervase
What is the name of these roses dyou know
he asked the waiter
The waiter was ready at all times to conceal his ignorance concerning items of the winelist or menu he was frankly ignorant as to the specific name of the roses
AMY SYLVESTER PARTINGLON said a voice at Jertons elbow
The voice came from a pleasantfaced welldressed young woman who was sitting at a table that almost touched Jertons
He thanked her hurriedly and nervously for the information and made some inconsequent remark about the flowers
It is a curious thing said the young woman that I should be able to tell you the name of those roses without an effort of memory because if you were to ask me my name I should be utterly unable to give it to you
Jerton had not harboured the least intention of extending his thirst for namelabels to his neighbour
After her rather remarkable announcement however he was obliged to say something in the way of polite inquiry
Yes answered the lady I suppose it is a case of partial loss of memory
I was in the train coming down here my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place
I had a couple of fivepound notes and a sovereign on me no visiting cards or any other means of identification and no idea as to who I am
I can only hazily recollect that I have a title I am Lady Somebody  beyond that my mind is a blank
Hadnt you any luggage with you
asked Jerton
That is what I didnt know
I knew the name of this hotel and made up my mind to come here and when the hotel porter who meets the trains asked if I had any luggage I had to invent a dressingbag and dressbasket I could always pretend that they had gone astray
I gave him the name of Smith and presently he emerged from a confused pile of luggage and passengers with a dressing bag and dressbasket labelled KestrelSmith
I had to take them I dont see what else I could have done
Jerton said nothing but he rather wondered what the lawful owner of the baggage would do
Of course it was dreadful arriving at a strange hotel with the name of KestrelSmith but it would have been worse to have arrived without luggage
Anyhow I hate causing trouble
Jerton had visions of harassed railway officials and distraught KestrelSmiths but he made no attempt to clothe his mental picture in words
The lady continued her story
Naturally none of my keys would fit the things but I told an intelligent page boy that I had lost my keyring and he had the locks forced in a twinkling
Rather too intelligent that boy he will probably end in Dartmoor
The KestrelSmith toilet tools arent up to much but they are better than nothing
If you feel sure that you have a title said Jerton  why not get hold of a peerage and go right through it
I tried that
I skimmed through the list of the House of Lords in Whitaker but a mere printed string of names conveys awfully little to one you know
If you were an army officer and had lost your identity you might pore over the Army List for months without finding out who your were
Im going on another tack Im trying to find out by various little tests who I am NOT  that will narrow the range of uncertainty down a bit
You may have noticed for instance that Im lunching principally off lobster Newburg
Jerton had not ventured to notice anything of the sort
Its an extravagance because its one of the most expensive dishes on the menu but at any rate it proves that Im not Lady Starping she never touches shellfish and poor Lady Braddleshrub has no digestion at all if I am HER I shall certainly die in agony in the course of the afternoon and the duty of finding out who I am will devolve on the press and the police and those sort of people I shall be past caring
Lady Knewford doesnt know one rose from another and she hates men so she wouldnt have spoken to you in any case and Lady Mousehilton flirts with every man she meets  I havent flirted with you have I
Jerton hastily gave the required assurance
Well you see continued the lady that knocks four off the list at once
Itll be rather a lengthy process bringing the list down to one said Jerton
Oh but of course there are heaps of them that I couldnt possibly be  women whove got grandchildren or sons old enough to have celebrated their coming of age
Ive only got to consider the ones about my own age
I tell you how you might help me this afternoon if you dont mind go through any of the back numbers of COUNTRY LIFE and those sort of papers that you can find in the smokingroom and see if you come across my portrait with infant son or anything of that sort
It wont take you ten minutes
Ill meet you in the lounge about teatime
Thanks awfully
And the Fair Unknown having graciously pressed Jerton into the search for her lost identity rose and left the room
As she passed the young mans table she halted for a moment and whispered Did you notice that I tipped the waiter a shilling
We can cross Lady Ulwight off the list she would have died rather than do that
At five oclock Jerton made his way to the hotel lounge he had spent a diligent but fruitless quarter of an hour among the illustrated weeklies in the smoking room
His new acquaintance was seated at a small tea table with a waiter hovering in attendance
China tea or Indian
she asked as Jerton came up
China please and nothing to eat
Have you discovered anything
Only negative information
Im not Lady Befnal
She disapproves dreadfully of any form of gambling so when I recognised a wellknown book maker in the hotel lobby I went and put a tenner on an unnamed filly by William the Third out of Mitrovitza for the threefifteen race
I suppose the fact of the animal being nameless was what attracted me
Did it win
asked Jerton
No came in fourth the most irritating thing a horse can do when youve backed it win or place
Anyhow I know now that Im not Lady Befnal
It seems to me that the knowledge was rather dearly bought commented Jerton
Well yes it has rather cleared me out admitted the identityseeker a florin is about all Ive got left on me
The lobster Newburg made my lunch rather an expensive one and of course I had to tip that boy for what he did to the KestrelSmith locks
Ive got rather a useful idea though
I feel certain that I belong to the Pivot Club Ill go back to town and ask the hall porter there if there are any letters for me
He knows all the members by sight and if there are any letters or telephone messages waiting for me of course that will solve the problem
If he says there arent any I shall say You know who I am dont you
so Ill find out anyway
The plan seemed a sound one a difficulty in its execution suggested itself to Jerton
Of course said the lady when he hinted at the obstacle theres my fare back to town and my bill here and cabs and things
If youll lend me three pounds that ought to see me through comfortably
Thanks ever so
Then there is the question of that luggage I dont want to be saddled with that for the rest of my life
Ill have it brought down to the hall and you can pretend to mount guard over it while Im writing a letter
Then I shall just slip away to the station and you can wander off to the smokingroom and they can do what they like with the things
Theyll advertise them after a bit and the owner can claim them
Jerton acquiesced in the manoeuvre and duly mounted guard over the luggage while its temporary owner slipped unobtrusively out of the hotel
Her departure was not however altogether unnoticed
Two gentlemen were strolling past Jerton and one of them remarked to the other Did you see that tall young woman in grey who went out just now
She is the Lady   His promenade carried him out of earshot at the critical moment when he was about to disclose the elusive identity
The Lady Who
Jerton could scarcely run after a total stranger break into his conversation and ask him for information concerning a chance passerby
Besides it was desirable that he should keep up the appearance of looking after the luggage
In a minute or two however the important personage the man who knew came strolling back alone
Jerton summoned up all his courage and waylaid him
I think I heard you say you knew the lady who went out of the hotel a few minutes ago a tall lady dressed in grey
Excuse me for asking if you could tell me her name Ive been talking to her for half an hour she  er  she knows all my people and seems to know me so I suppose Ive met her somewhere before but Im blest if I can put a name to her
Could you  
Certainly
Shes a Mrs
Stroope
MRS
queried Jerton
Yes shes the Lady Champion at golf in my part of the world
An awful good sort and goes about a good deal in Society but she has an awkward habit of losing her memory every now and then and gets into all sorts of fixes
Shes furious too if you make any allusion to it afterwards
Good day sir
The stranger passed on his way and before Jerton had had time to assimilate his information he found his whole attention centred on an angrylooking lady who was making loud and fretfulseeming inquiries of the hotel clerks
Has any luggage been brought here from the station by mistake a dressbasket and dressingcase with the name KestrelSmith
It cant be traced anywhere
I saw it put in at Victoria that Ill swear
Why  there is my luggage
and the locks have been tampered with
Jerton heard no more
He fled down to the Turkish bath and stayed there for hours
THE STALLED OX THEOPHIL ESHLEY was an artist by profession a cattle painter by force of environment
It is not to be supposed that he lived on a ranche or a dairy farm in an atmosphere pervaded with horn and hoof milkingstool and brandingiron
His home was in a parklike villa dotted district that only just escaped the reproach of being suburban
On one side of his garden there abutted a small picturesque meadow in which an enterprising neighbour pastured some small picturesque cows of the Channel Island persuasion
At noonday in summertime the cows stood kneedeep in tall meadowgrass under the shade of a group of walnut trees with the sunlight falling in dappled patches on their mousesleek coats
Eshley had conceived and executed a dainty picture of two reposeful milchcows in a setting of walnut tree and meadowgrass and filtered sunbeam and the Royal Academy had duly exposed the same on the walls of its Summer Exhibition
The Royal Academy encourages orderly methodical habits in its children
Eshley had painted a successful and acceptable picture of cattle drowsing picturesquely under walnut trees and as he had begun so of necessity he went on
His Noontide Peace a study of two dun cows under a walnut tree was followed by A Midday Sanctuary a study of a walnut tree with two dun cows under it
In due succession there came Where the Gad Flies Cease from Troubling The Haven of the Herd and Adream in Dairyland studies of walnut trees and dun cows
His two attempts to break away from his own tradition were signal failures Turtle Doves alarmed by Sparrowhawk and Wolves on the Roman Campagna came back to his studio in the guise of abominable heresies and Eshley climbed back into grace and the public gaze with A Shaded Nook where Drowsy Milkers Dream
On a fine afternoon in late autumn he was putting some finishing touches to a study of meadow weeds when his neighbour Adela Pingsford assailed the outer door of his studio with loud peremptory knockings
There is an ox in my garden she announced in explanation of the tempestuous intrusion
An ox said Eshley blankly and rather fatuously what kind of ox
Oh I dont know what kind snapped the lady
A common or garden ox to use the slang expression
It is the garden part of it that I object to
My garden has just been put straight for the winter and an ox roaming about in it wont improve matters
Besides there are the chrysanthemums just coming into flower
How did it get into the garden
asked Eshley
I imagine it came in by the gate said the lady impatiently it couldnt have climbed the walls and I dont suppose anyone dropped it from an aeroplane as a Bovril advertisement
The immediately important question is not how it got in but how to get it out
Wont it go
said Eshley
If it was anxious to go said Adela Pingsford rather angrily I should not have come here to chat with you about it
Im practically all alone the housemaid is having her afternoon out and the cook is lying down with an attack of neuralgia
Anything that I may have learned at school or in after life about how to remove a large ox from a small garden seems to have escaped from my memory now
All I could think of was that you were a near neighbour and a cattle painter presumably more or less familiar with the subjects that you painted and that you might be of some slight assistance
Possibly I was mistaken
I paint dairy cows certainly admitted Eshley but I cannot claim to have had any experience in roundingup stray oxen
Ive seen it done on a cinema film of course but there were always horses and lots of other accessories besides one never knows how much of those pictures are faked
Adela Pingsford said nothing but led the way to her garden
It was normally a fairsized garden but it looked small in comparison with the ox a huge mottled brute dull red about the head and shoulders passing to dirty white on the flanks and hindquarters with shaggy ears and large bloodshot eyes
It bore about as much resemblance to the dainty paddock heifers that Eshley was accustomed to paint as the chief of a Kurdish nomad clan would to a Japanese teashop girl
Eshley stood very near the gate while he studied the animals appearance and demeanour
Adela Pingsford continued to say nothing
Its eating a chrysanthemum said Eshley at last when the silence had become unbearable
How observant you are said Adela bitterly
You seem to notice everything
As a matter of fact it has got six chrysanthemums in its mouth at the present moment
The necessity for doing something was becoming imperative
Eshley took a step or two in the direction of the animal clapped his hands and made noises of the Hish and Shoo variety
If the ox heard them it gave no outward indication of the fact
If any hens should ever stray into my garden said Adela I should certainly send for you to frighten them out
You shoo beautifully
Meanwhile do you mind trying to drive that ox away
That is a MADEMOISELLE LOUISE BICHOT that hes begun on now she added in icy calm as a glowing orange head was crushed into the huge munching mouth
Since you have been so frank about the variety of the chrysanthemum said Eshley I dont mind telling you that this is an Ayrshire ox
The icy calm broke down Adela Pingsford used language that sent the artist instinctively a few feet nearer to the ox
He picked up a peastick and flung it with some determination against the animals mottled flanks
The operation of mashing MADEMOISELLE LOUISE BICHOT into a petal salad was suspended for a long moment while the ox gazed with concentrated inquiry at the stickthrower
Adela gazed with equal concentration and more obvious hostility at the same focus
As the beast neither lowered its head nor stamped its feet Eshley ventured on another javelin exercise with another peastick
The ox seemed to realise at once that it was to go it gave a hurried final pluck at the bed where the chrysanthemums had been and strode swiftly up the garden
Eshley ran to head it towards the gate but only succeeded in quickening its pace from a walk to a lumbering trot
With an air of inquiry but with no real hesitation it crossed the tiny strip of turf that the charitable called the croquet lawn and pushed its way through the open French window into the morningroom
Some chrysanthemums and other autumn herbage stood about the room in vases and the animal resumed its browsing operations all the same Eshley fancied that the beginnings of a hunted look had come into its eyes a look that counselled respect
He discontinued his attempt to interfere with its choice of surroundings
Mr Eshley said Adela in a shaking voice I asked you to drive that beast out of my garden but I did not ask you to drive it into my house
If I must have it anywhere on the premises I prefer the garden to the morningroom
Cattle drives are not in my line said Eshley if I remember I told you so at the outset
I quite agree retorted the lady painting pretty pictures of pretty little cows is what youre suited for
Perhaps youd like to do a nice sketch of that ox making itself at home in my morningroom
This time it seemed as if the worm had turned Eshley began striding away
Where are you going
screamed Adela
To fetch implements was the answer
Implements
I wont have you use a lasso
The room will be wrecked if theres a struggle
But the artist marched out of the garden
In a couple of minutes he returned laden with easel sketchingstool and painting materials
Do you mean to say that youre going to sit quietly down and paint that brute while its destroying my morningroom
gasped Adela
It was your suggestion said Eshley setting his canvas in position
I forbid it I absolutely forbid it
stormed Adela
I dont see what standing you have in the matter said the artist you can hardly pretend that its your ox even by adoption
You seem to forget that its in my morningroom eating my flowers came the raging retort
You seem to forget that the cook has neuralgia said Eshley she may be just dozing off into a merciful sleep and your outcry will waken her
Consideration for others should be the guiding principle of people in our station of life
The man is mad
exclaimed Adela tragically
A moment later it was Adela herself who appeared to go mad
The ox had finished the vaseflowers and the cover of Israel Kalisch and appeared to be thinking of leaving its rather restricted quarters
Eshley noticed its restlessness and promptly flung it some bunches of Virginia creeper leaves as an inducement to continue the sitting
I forget how the proverb runs he observed of something about better a dinner of herbs than a stalled ox where hate is
We seem to have all the ingredients for the proverb ready to hand
I shall go to the Public Library and get them to telephone for the police announced Adela and raging audibly she departed
Some minutes later the ox awakening probably to the suspicion that oil cake and chopped mangold was waiting for it in some appointed byre stepped with much precaution out of the morningroom stared with grave inquiry at the no longer obtrusive and peastickthrowing human and then lumbered heavily but swiftly out of the garden
Eshley packed up his tools and followed the animals example and Larkdene was left to neuralgia and the cook
The episode was the turningpoint in Eshleys artistic career
His remarkable picture Ox in a morningroom late autumn was one of the sensations and successes of the next Paris Salon and when it was subsequently exhibited at Munich it was bought by the Bavarian Government in the teeth of the spirited bidding of three meatextract firms
From that moment his success was continuous and assured and the Royal Academy was thankful two years later to give a conspicuous position on its walls to his large canvas Barbary Apes Wrecking a Boudoir
Eshley presented Adela Pingsford with a new copy of Israel Kalisch and a couple of finely flowering plants of MADAME ADNRE BLUSSET but nothing in the nature of a real reconciliation has taken place between them
THE STORYTELLER IT was a hot afternoon and the railway carriage was correspondingly sultry and the next stop was at Templecombe nearly an hour ahead
The occupants of the carriage were a small girl and a smaller girl and a small boy
An aunt belonging to the children occupied one corner seat and the further corner seat on the opposite side was occupied by a bachelor who was a stranger to their party but the small girls and the small boy emphatically occupied the compartment
Both the aunt and the children were conversational in a limited persistent way reminding one of the attentions of a housefly that refuses to be discouraged
Most of the aunts remarks seemed to begin with Dont and nearly all of the childrens remarks began with Why
The bachelor said nothing out loud
Dont Cyril dont exclaimed the aunt as the small boy began smacking the cushions of the seat producing a cloud of dust at each blow
Come and look out of the window she added
The child moved reluctantly to the window
Why are those sheep being driven out of that field
he asked
I expect they are being driven to another field where there is more grass said the aunt weakly
But there is lots of grass in that field protested the boy theres nothing else but grass there
Aunt theres lots of grass in that field
Perhaps the grass in the other field is better suggested the aunt fatuously
Why is it better
came the swift inevitable question
Oh look at those cows
exclaimed the aunt
Nearly every field along the line had contained cows or bullocks but she spoke as though she were drawing attention to a rarity
Why is the grass in the other field better
persisted Cyril
The frown on the bachelors face was deepening to a scowl
He was a hard unsympathetic man the aunt decided in her mind
She was utterly unable to come to any satisfactory decision about the grass in the other field
The smaller girl created a diversion by beginning to recite On the Road to Mandalay
She only knew the first line but she put her limited knowledge to the fullest possible use
She repeated the line over and over again in a dreamy but resolute and very audible voice it seemed to the bachelor as though some one had had a bet with her that she could not repeat the line aloud two thousand times without stopping
Whoever it was who had made the wager was likely to lose his bet
Come over here and listen to a story said the aunt when the bachelor had looked twice at her and once at the communication cord
The children moved listlessly towards the aunts end of the carriage
Evidently her reputation as a story teller did not rank high in their estimation
In a low confidential voice interrupted at frequent intervals by loud petulant questionings from her listeners she began an unenterprising and deplorably uninteresting story about a little girl who was good and made friends with every one on account of her goodness and was finally saved from a mad bull by a number of rescuers who admired her moral character
Wouldnt they have saved her if she hadnt been good
demanded the bigger of the small girls
It was exactly the question that the bachelor had wanted to ask
Well yes admitted the aunt lamely but I dont think they would have run quite so fast to her help if they had not liked her so much
Its the stupidest story Ive ever heard said the bigger of the small girls with immense conviction
I didnt listen after the first bit it was so stupid said Cyril
The smaller girl made no actual comment on the story but she had long ago recommenced a murmured repetition of her favourite line
You dont seem to be a success as a storyteller said the bachelor suddenly from his corner
The aunt bristled in instant defence at this unexpected attack
Its a very difficult thing to tell stories that children can both understand and appreciate she said stiffly
I dont agree with you said the bachelor
Perhaps you would like to tell them a story was the aunts retort
Tell us a story demanded the bigger of the small girls
Once upon a time began the bachelor there was a little girl called Bertha who was extraordinarily good
The childrens momentarilyaroused interest began at once to flicker all stories seemed dreadfully alike no matter who told them
She did all that she was told she was always truthful she kept her clothes clean ate milk puddings as though they were jam tarts learned her lessons perfectly and was polite in her manners
Was she pretty
asked the bigger of the small girls
Not as pretty as any of you said the bachelor but she was horribly good
There was a wave of reaction in favour of the story the word horrible in connection with goodness was a novelty that commended itself
It seemed to introduce a ring of truth that was absent from the aunts tales of infant life
She was so good continued the bachelor that she won several medals for goodness which she always wore pinned on to her dress
There was a medal for obedience another medal for punctuality and a third for good behaviour
They were large metal medals and they clicked against one another as she walked
No other child in the town where she lived had as many as three medals so everybody knew that she must be an extra good child
Horribly good quoted Cyril
Everybody talked about her goodness and the Prince of the country got to hear about it and he said that as she was so very good she might be allowed once a week to walk in his park which was just outside the town
It was a beautiful park and no children were ever allowed in it so it was a great honour for Bertha to be allowed to go there
Were there any sheep in the park
demanded Cyril
No said the bachelor there were no sheep
Why werent there any sheep
came the inevitable question arising out of that answer
The aunt permitted herself a smile which might almost have been described as a grin
There were no sheep in the park said the bachelor because the Princes mother had once had a dream that her son would either be killed by a sheep or else by a clock falling on him
For that reason the Prince never kept a sheep in his park or a clock in his palace
The aunt suppressed a gasp of admiration
Was the Prince killed by a sheep or by a clock
asked Cyril
He is still alive so we cant tell whether the dream will come true said the bachelor unconcernedly anyway there were no sheep in the park but there were lots of little pigs running all over the place
What colour were they
Black with white faces white with black spots black all over grey with white patches and some were white all over
The storyteller paused to let a full idea of the parks treasures sink into the childrens imaginations then he resumed Bertha was rather sorry to find that there were no flowers in the park
She had promised her aunts with tears in her eyes that she would not pick any of the kind Princes flowers and she had meant to keep her promise so of course it made her feel silly to find that there were no flowers to pick
Why werent there any flowers
Because the pigs had eaten them all said the bachelor promptly
The gardeners had told the Prince that you couldnt have pigs and flowers so he decided to have pigs and no flowers
There was a murmur of approval at the excellence of the Princes decision so many people would have decided the other way
There were lots of other delightful things in the park
There were ponds with gold and blue and green fish in them and trees with beautiful parrots that said clever things at a moments notice and humming birds that hummed all the popular tunes of the day
Bertha walked up and down and enjoyed herself immensely and thought to herself If I were not so extraordinarily good I should not have been allowed to come into this beautiful park and enjoy all that there is to be seen in it and her three medals clinked against one another as she walked and helped to remind her how very good she really was
Just then an enormous wolf came prowling into the park to see if it could catch a fat little pig for its supper
What colour was it
asked the children amid an immediate quickening of interest
Mudcolour all over with a black tongue and pale grey eyes that gleamed with unspeakable ferocity
The first thing that it saw in the park was Bertha her pinafore was so spotlessly white and clean that it could be seen from a great distance
Bertha saw the wolf and saw that it was stealing towards her and she began to wish that she had never been allowed to come into the park
She ran as hard as she could and the wolf came after her with huge leaps and bounds
She managed to reach a shrubbery of myrtle bushes and she hid herself in one of the thickest of the bushes
The wolf came sniffing among the branches its black tongue lolling out of its mouth and its pale grey eyes glaring with rage
Bertha was terribly frightened and thought to herself If I had not been so extraordinarily good I should have been safe in the town at this moment
However the scent of the myrtle was so strong that the wolf could not sniff out where Bertha was hiding and the bushes were so thick that he might have hunted about in them for a long time without catching sight of her so he thought he might as well go off and catch a little pig instead
Bertha was trembling very much at having the wolf prowling and sniffing so near her and as she trembled the medal for obedience clinked against the medals for good conduct and punctuality
The wolf was just moving away when he heard the sound of the medals clinking and stopped to listen they clinked again in a bush quite near him
He dashed into the bush his pale grey eyes gleaming with ferocity and triumph and dragged Bertha out and devoured her to the last morsel
All that was left of her were her shoes bits of clothing and the three medals for goodness
Were any of the little pigs killed
No they all escaped
The story began badly said the smaller of the small girls but it had a beautiful ending
It is the most beautiful story that I ever heard said the bigger of the small girls with immense decision
It is the ONLY beautiful story I have ever heard said Cyril
A dissentient opinion came from the aunt
A most improper story to tell to young children
You have undermined the effect of years of careful teaching
At any rate said the bachelor collecting his belongings preparatory to leaving the carriage I kept them quiet for ten minutes which was more than you were able to do
Unhappy woman
he observed to himself as he walked down the platform of Templecombe station for the next six months or so those children will assail her in public with demands for an improper story
A DEFENSIVE DIAMOND TREDDLEFORD sat in an easeful armchair in front of a slumberous fire with a volume of verse in his hand and the comfortable consciousness that outside the club windows the rain was dripping and pattering with persistent purpose
A chill wet October afternoon was merging into a bleak wet October evening and the club smokingroom seemed warmer and cosier by contrast
It was an afternoon on which to be wafted away from ones climatic surroundings and The Golden journey to Samarkand promised to bear Treddleford well and bravely into other lands and under other skies
He had already migrated from London the rainswept to Bagdad the Beautiful and stood by the Sun Gate in the olden time when an icy breath of imminent annoyance seemed to creep between the book and himself
Amblecope the man with the restless prominent eyes and the mouth ready mobilised for conversational openings had planted himself in a neighbouring armchair
For a twelvemonth and some odd weeks Treddleford had skilfully avoided making the acquaintance of his voluble fellowclubman he had marvellously escaped from the infliction of his relentless record of tedious personal achievements or alleged achievements on golf links turf and gaming table by flood and field and covertside
Now his season of immunity was coming to an end
There was no escape in another moment he would be numbered among those who knew Amblecope to speak to  or rather to suffer being spoken to
The intruder was armed with a copy of COUNTRY LIFE not for purposes of reading but as an aid to conversational icebreaking
Rather a good portrait of Throstlewing he remarked explosively turning his large challenging eyes on Treddleford somehow it reminds me very much of Yellowstep who was supposed to be such a good thing for the Grand Prix in 1903
Curious race that was I suppose Ive seen every race for the Grand Prix for the last   Be kind enough never to mention the Grand Prix in my hearing said Treddleford desperately it awakens acutely distressing memories
I cant explain why without going into a long and complicated story
Oh certainly certainly said Amblecope hastily long and complicated stories that were not told by himself were abominable in his eyes
He turned the pages of COUNTRY LIFE and became spuriously interested in the picture of a Mongolian pheasant
Not a bad representation of the Mongolian variety he exclaimed holding it up for his neighbours inspection
They do very well in some covers
Take some stopping too once theyre fairly on the wing
I suppose the biggest bag I ever made in two successive days   My aunt who owns the greater part of Lincolnshire broke in Treddleford with dramatic abruptness possesses perhaps the most remarkable record in the way of a pheasant bag that has ever been achieved
She is seventyfive and cant hit a thing but she always goes out with the guns
When I say she cant hit a thing I dont mean to say that she doesnt occasionally endanger the lives of her fellowguns because that wouldnt be true
In fact the chief Government Whip wont allow Ministerial MP
s to go out with her We dont want to incur byelections needlessly he quite reasonably observed
Well the other day she winged a pheasant and brought it to earth with a feather or two knocked out of it it was a runner and my aunt saw herself in danger of being done out of about the only bird shed hit during the present reign
Of course she wasnt going to stand that she followed it through bracken and brushwood and when it took to the open country and started across a ploughed field she jumped on to the shooting pony and went after it
The chase was a long one and when my aunt at last ran the bird to a standstill she was nearer home than she was to the shooting party she had left that some five miles behind her
Rather a long run for a wounded pheasant snapped Amblecope
The story rests on my aunts authority said Treddleford coldly and she is local vicepresident of the Young Womens Christian Association
She trotted three miles or so to her home and it was not till the middle of the afternoon that it was discovered that the lunch for the entire shooting party was in a pannier attached to the ponys saddle
Anyway she got her bird
Some birds of course take a lot of killing said Amblecope so do some fish
I remember once I was fishing in the Exe lovely trout stream lots of fish though they dont run to any great size   One of them did announced Treddleford with emphasis
My uncle the Bishop of Southmolton came across a giant trout in a pool just off the main stream of the Exe near Ugworthy he tried it with every kind of fly and worm every day for three weeks without an atom of success and then Fate intervened on his behalf
There was a low stone bridge just over this pool and on the last day of his fishing holiday a motor van ran violently into the parapet and turned completely over no one was hurt but part of the parapet was knocked away and the entire load that the van was carrying was pitched over and fell a little way into the pool
In a couple of minutes the giant trout was flapping and twisting on bare mud at the bottom of a waterless pool and my uncle was able to walk down to him and fold him to his breast
The vanload consisted of blottingpaper and every drop of water in that pool had been sucked up into the mass of spilt cargo
There was silence for nearly half a minute in the smokingroom and Treddleford began to let his mind steal back towards the golden road that led to Samarkand
Amblecope however rallied and remarked in a rather tired and dispirited voice Talking of motor accidents the narrowest squeak I ever had was the other day motoring with old Tommy Yarby in North Wales
Awfully good sort old Yarby thorough good sportsman and the best   It was in North Wales said Treddleford that my sister met with her sensational carriage accident last year
She was on her way to a gardenparty at Lady Ninevehs about the only gardenparty that ever comes to pass in those parts in the course of the year and therefore a thing that she would have been very sorry to miss
She was driving a young horse that shed only bought a week or two previously warranted to be perfectly steady with motor traffic bicycles and other common objects of the roadside
The animal lived up to its reputation and passed the most explosive of motor bikes with an indifference that almost amounted to apathy
However I suppose we all draw the line somewhere and this particular cob drew it at travelling wild beast shows
Of course my sister didnt know that but she knew it very distinctly when she turned a sharp corner and found herself in a mixed company of camels piebald horses and canarycoloured vans
The dogcart was overturned in a ditch and kicked to splinters and the cob went home across country
Neither my sister nor the groom was hurt but the problem of how to get to the Nineveh gardenparty some three miles distant seemed rather difficult to solve once there of course my sister would easily find some one to drive her home
I suppose you wouldnt care for the loan of a couple of my camels
the showman suggested in humorous sympathy 
I would said my sister who had ridden camelback in Egypt and she overruled the objections of the groom who hadnt
She picked out two of the most presentable looking of the beasts and had them dusted and made as tidy as was possible at short notice and set out for the Nineveh mansion
You may imagine the sensation that her small but imposing caravan created when she arrived at the hall door
The entire gardenparty flocked up to gape
My sister was rather glad to slip down from her camel and the groom was thankful to scramble down from his
Then young Billy Doulton of the Dragoon Guards who has been a lot at Aden and thinks he knows camel language backwards thought he would show off by making the beasts kneel down in orthodox fashion
Unfortunately camel wordsofcommand are not the same all the world over these were magnificent Turkestan camels accustomed to stride up the stony terraces of mountain passes and when Doulton shouted at them they went side by side up the front steps into the entrance hall and up the grand staircase
The German governess met them just at the turn of the corridor
The Ninevehs nursed her with devoted attention for weeks and when I last heard from them she was well enough to go about her duties again but the doctor says she will always suffer from Hagenbeck heart
Amblecope got up from his chair and moved to another part of the room
Treddleford reopened his book and betook himself once more across The dragongreen the luminous the dark the serpenthaunted sea
For a blessed halfhour he disported himself in imagination by the gay AleppoGate and listened to the birdvoiced singingman
Then the world of today called him back a page summoned him to speak with a friend on the telephone
As Treddleford was about to pass out of the room he encountered Amblecope also passing out on his way to the billiardroom where perchance some luckless wight might be secured and held fast to listen to the number of his attendances at the Grand Prix with subsequent remarks on Newmarket and the Cambridgeshire
Amblecope made as if to pass out first but a newborn pride was surging in Treddlefords breast and he waved him back
I believe I take precedence he said coldly you are merely the club Bore I am the club Liar
THE ELK TERESA Mrs Thropplestance was the richest and most intractable old woman in the county of Woldshire
In her dealings with the world in general her manner suggested a blend between a Mistress of the Robes and a Master of Foxhounds with the vocabulary of both
In her domestic circle she comported herself in the arbitrary style that one attributes probably without the least justification to an American political Boss in the bosom of his caucus
The late Theodore Thropplestance had left her some thirtyfive years ago in absolute possession of a considerable fortune a large landed property and a gallery full of valuable pictures
In those intervening years she had outlived her son and quarrelled with her elder grandson who had married without her consent or approval
Bertie Thropplestance her younger grandson was the heirdesignate to her property and as such he was a centre of interest and concern to some halfhundred ambitious mothers with daughters of marriageable age
Bertie was an amiable easygoing young man who was quite ready to marry anyone who was favourably recommended to his notice but he was not going to waste his time in falling in love with anyone who would come under his grandmothers veto
The favourable recommendation would have to come from Mrs Thropplestance
Teresas houseparties were always rounded off with a plentiful garnishing of presentable young women and alert attendant mothers but the old lady was emphatically discouraging whenever any one of her girl guests became at all likely to outbid the others as a possible granddaughterinlaw
It was the inheritance of her fortune and estate that was in question and she was evidently disposed to exercise and enjoy her powers of selection and rejection to the utmost
Berties preferences did not greatly matter he was of the sort who can be stolidly happy with any kind of wife he had cheerfully put up with his grandmother all his life so was not likely to fret and fume over anything that might befall him in the way of a helpmate
The party that gathered under Teresas roof in Christmas week of the year nineteenhundredandsomething was of smaller proportions than usual and Mrs Yonelet who formed one of the party was inclined to deduce hopeful augury from this circumstance
Dora Yonelet and Bertie were so obviously made for one another she confided to the vicars wife and if the old lady were accustomed to seeing them about a lot together she might adopt the view that they would make a suitable married couple
People soon get used to an idea if it is dangled constantly before their eyes said Mrs Yonelet hopefully and the more often Teresa sees those young people together happy in each others company the more she will get to take a kindly interest in Dora as a possible and desirable wife for Bertie
My dear said the vicars wife resignedly my own Sybil was thrown together with Bertie under the most romantic circumstances  Ill tell you about it some day  but it made no impression whatever on Teresa she put her foot down in the most uncompromising fashion and Sybil married an Indian civilian
Quite right of her said Mrs Yonelet with vague approval its what any girl of spirit would have done
Still that was a year or two ago I believe Bertie is older now and so is Teresa
Naturally she must be anxious to see him settled
The vicars wife reflected that Teresa seemed to be the one person who showed no immediate anxiety to supply Bertie with a wife but she kept the thought to herself
Mrs Yonelet was a woman of resourceful energy and generalship she involved the other members of the house party the deadweight so to speak in all manner of exercises and occupations that segregated them from Bertie and Dora who were left to their own devisings  that is to say to Doras devisings and Berties accommodating acquiescence
Dora helped in the Christmas decorations of the parish church and Bertie helped her to help
Together they fed the swans till the birds went on a dyspepsiastrike together they played billiards together they photographed the village almshouses and at a respectful distance the tame elk that browsed in solitary aloofness in the park
It was tame in the sense that it had long ago discarded the least vestige of fear of the human race nothing in its record encouraged its human neighbours to feel a reciprocal confidence
Whatever sport or exercise or occupation Bertie and Dora indulged in together was unfailingly chronicled and advertised by Mrs Yonelet for the due enlightenment of Berties grandmother
Those two inseparables have just come in from a bicycle ride she would announce quite a picture they make so fresh and glowing after their spin
A picture needing words would be Teresas private comment and as far as Bertie was concerned she was determined that the words should remain unspoken
On the afternoon after Christmas Day Mrs Yonelet dashed into the drawingroom where her hostess was sitting amid a circle of guests and teacups and muffin dishes
Fate had placed what seemed like a trumpcard in the hands of the patientlymanoeuvring mother
With eyes blazing with excitement and a voice heavily escorted with exclamation marks she made a dramatic announcement
Bertie has saved Dora from the elk
In swift excited sentences broken with maternal emotion she gave supplementary information as to how the treacherous animal had ambushed Dora as she was hunting for a strayed golf ball and how Bertie had dashed to her rescue with a stable fork and driven the beast off in the nick of time
It was touch and go
She threw her niblick at it but that didnt stop it
In another moment she would have been crushed beneath its hoofs panted Mrs Yonelet
The animal is not safe said Teresa handing her agitated guest a cup of tea
I forget if you take sugar
I suppose the solitary life it leads has soured its temper
There are muffins in the grate
Its not my fault Ive tried to get it a mate for ever so long
You dont know of anyone with a lady elk for sale or exchange do you
she asked the company generally
But Mrs Yonelet was in no humour to listen to talk of elk marriages
The mating of two human beings was the subject uppermost in her mind and the opportunity for advancing her pet project was too valuable to be neglected
Teresa she exclaimed impressively after those two young people have been thrown together so dramatically nothing can be quite the same again between them
Bertie has done more than save Doras life he has earned her affection
One cannot help feeling that Fate has consecrated them for one another
Exactly what the vicars wife said when Bertie saved Sybil from the elk a year or two ago observed Teresa placidly I pointed out to her that he had rescued Mirabel Hicks from the same predicement a few months previously and that priority really belonged to the gardeners boy who had been rescued in the January of that year
There is a good deal of sameness in country life you know
It seems to be a very dangerous animal said one of the guests
Thats what the mother of the gardeners boy said remarked Teresa she wanted me to have it destroyed but I pointed out to her that she had eleven children and I had only one elk
I also gave her a black silk skirt she said that though there hadnt been a funeral in her family she felt as if there had been
Anyhow we parted friends
I cant offer you a silk skirt Emily but you may have another cup of tea
As I have already remarked there are muffins in the grate
Teresa dosed the discussion having deftly conveyed the impression that she considered the mother of the gardeners boy had shown a far more reasonable spirit than the parents of other elkassaulted victims
Teresa is devoid of feeling said Mrs Yonelet afterwards to the vicars wife to sit there talking of muffins with an appalling tragedy only narrowly averted   Of course you know whom she really intends Bertie to marry
asked the vicars wife Ive noticed it for some time
The Bickelbys German governess
A German governess
What an idea
gasped Mrs Yonelet
Shes of quite good family I believe said the vicars wife and not at all the mouseintheback ground sort of person that governesses are usually supposed to be
In fact next to Teresa shes about the most assertive and combative personality in the neighbourhood
Shes pointed out to my husband all sorts of errors in his sermons and she gave Sir Laurence a public lecture on how he ought to handle the hounds
You know how sensitive Sir Laurence is about any criticism of his Mastership and to have a governess laying down the law to him nearly drove him into a fit
Shes behaved like that to every one except of course Teresa and every one has been defensively rude to her in return
The Bickelbys are simply too afraid of her to get rid of her
Now isnt that exactly the sort of woman whom Teresa would take a delight in installing as her successor
Imagine the discomfort and awkwardness in the county if we suddenly found that she was to be the future hostess at the Hall
Teresas only regret will be that she wont be alive to see it
But objected Mrs Yonelet surely Bertie hasnt shown the least sign of being attracted in that quarter
Oh shes quite nicelooking in a way and dresses well and plays a good game of tennis
She often comes across the park with messages from the Bickelby mansion and one of these days Bertie will rescue her from the elk which has become almost a habit with him and Teresa will say that Fate has consecrated them to one another
Bertie might not be disposed to pay much attention to the consecrations of Fate but he would not dream of opposing his grandmother
The vicars wife spoke with the quiet authority of one who has intuitive knowledge and in her heart of hearts Mrs Yonelet believed her
Six months later the elk had to be destroyed
In a fit of exceptional moroseness it had killed the Bickelbys German governess
It was an irony of its fate that it should achieve popularity in the last moments of its career at any rate it established the record of being the only living thing that had permanently thwarted Teresa Thropplestances plans
Dora Yonelet broke off her engagement with an Indian civilian and married Bertie three months after his grandmothers death  Teresa did not long survive the German governess fiasco
At Christmas time every year young Mrs Thropplestance hangs an extra large festoon of evergreens on the elk horns that decorate the hall
It was a fearsome beast she observes to Bertie but I always feel that it was instrumental in bringing us together
Which of course was true
DOWN PENS HAVE you written to thank the Froplinsons for what they sent us
asked Egbert
No said Janetta with a note of tired defiance in her voice Ive written eleven letters today expressing surprise and gratitude for sundry unmerited gifts but I havent written to the Froplinsons
Some one will have to write to them said Egbert
I dont dispute the necessity but I dont think the some one should be me said Janetta
I wouldnt mind writing a letter of angry recrimination or heartless satire to some suitable recipient in fact I should rather enjoy it but Ive come to the end of my capacity for expressing servile amiability
Eleven letters today and nine yesterday all couched in the same strain of ecstatic thankfulness really you cant expect me to sit down to another
There is such a thing as writing oneself out
Ive written nearly as many said Egbert and Ive had my usual business correspondence to get through too
Besides I dont know what it was that the Froplinsons sent us
A William the Conqueror calendar said Janetta with a quotation of one of his great thoughts for every day in the year
Impossible said Egbert he didnt have three hundred and sixtyfive thoughts in the whole of his life or if he did he kept them to himself
He was a man of action not of introspection
Well it was William Wordsworth then said Janetta I know William came into it somewhere
That sounds more probable said Egbert well lets collaborate on this letter of thanks and get it done
Ill dictate and you can scribble it down
Dear Mrs Froplinson  thank you and your husband so much for the very pretty calendar you sent us
It was very good of you to think of us
 You cant possibly say that said Janetta laying down her pen
Its what I always do say and what every one says to me protested Egbert
We sent them something on the twentysecond said Janetta so they simply HAD to think of us
There was no getting away from it
What did we send them
asked Egbert gloomily
Bridgemarkers said Janetta in a cardboard case with some inanity about digging for fortune with a royal spade emblazoned on the cover
The moment I saw it in the shop I said to myself Froplinsons and to the attendant How much
When he said Ninepence I gave him their address jabbed our card in paid tenpence or elevenpence to cover the postage and thanked heaven
With less sincerity and infinitely more trouble they eventually thanked me
The Froplinsons dont play bridge said Egbert
One is not supposed to notice social deformities of that sort said Janetta it wouldnt be polite
Besides what trouble did they take to find out whether we read Wordsworth with gladness
For all they knew or cared we might be frantically embedded in the belief that all poetry begins and ends with John Masefield and it might infuriate or depress us to have a daily sample of Wordsworthian products flung at us
Well lets get on with the letter of thanks said Egbert
Proceed said Janetta 
How clever of you to guess that Wordsworth is our favourite poet  dictated Egbert
Again Janetta laid down her pen
Do you realise what that means
she asked a Wordsworth booklet next Christmas and another calendar the Christmas after with the same problem of having to write suitable letters of thankfulness
No the best thing to do is to drop all further allusion to the calendar and switch off on to some other topic
But what other topic
Oh something like this What do you think of the New Year Honours List
A friend of ours made such a clever remark when he read it
Then you can stick in any remark that comes into your head it neednt be clever
The Froplinsons wont know whether it is or isnt
We dont even know on which side they are in politics objected Egbert and anyhow you cant suddenly dismiss the subject of the calendar
Surely there must be some intelligent remark that can be made about it
Well we cant think of one said Janetta wearily the fact is weve both written ourselves out
Heavens
Ive just remembered Mrs Stephen Ludberry
I havent thanked her for what she sent
What did she send
I forget I think it was a calendar
There was a long silence the forlorn silence of those who are bereft of hope and have almost ceased to care
Presently Egbert started from his seat with an air of resolution
The light of battle was in his eyes
Let me come to the writingtable he exclaimed
Gladly said Janetta
Are you going to write to Mrs Ludberry or the Froplinsons
To neither said Egbert drawing a stack of notepaper towards him Im going to write to the editor of every enlightened and influential newspaper in the Kingdom Im going to suggest that there should be a sort of epistolary Truce of God during the festivities of Christmas and New Year
From the twentyfourth of December to the third or fourth of January it shall be considered an offence against good sense and good feeling to write or expect any letter or communication that does not deal with the necessary events of the moment
Answers to invitations arrangements about trains renewal of club subscriptions and of course all the ordinary everyday affairs of business sickness engaging new cooks and so forth these will be dealt with in the usual manner as something inevitable a legitimate part of our daily life
But all the devastating accretions of correspondence incident to the festive season these should be swept away to give the season a chance of being really festive a time of untroubled unpunctuated peace and good will
But you would have to make some acknowledgment of presents received objected Janetta otherwise people would never know whether they had arrived safely
Of course I have thought of that said Egbert every present that was sent off would be accompanied by a ticket bearing the date of dispatch and the signature of the sender and some conventional hieroglyphic to show that it was intended to be a Christmas or New Year gift there would be a counterfoil with space for the recipients name and the date of arrival and all you would have to do would be to sign and date the counterfoil add a conventional hieroglyphic indicating heartfelt thanks and gratified surprise put the thing into an envelope and post it
It sounds delightfully simple said Janetta wistfully but people would consider it too cutand dried too perfunctory
It is not a bit more perfunctory than the present system said Egbert I have only the same conventional language of gratitude at my disposal with which to thank dear old Colonel Chuttle for his perfectly delicious Stilton which we shall devour to the last morsel and the Froplinsons for their calendar which we shall never look at
Colonel Chuttle knows that we are grateful for the Stilton without having to be told so and the Froplinsons know that we are bored with their calendar whatever we may say to the contrary just as we know that they are bored with the bridgemarkers in spite of their written assurance that they thanked us for our charming little gift
What is more the Colonel knows that even if we had taken a sudden aversion to Stilton or been forbidden it by the doctor we should still have written a letter of hearty thanks around it
So you see the present system of acknowledgment is just as perfunctory and conventional as the counterfoil business would be only ten times more tiresome and brainracking
Your plan would certainly bring the ideal of a Happy Christmas a step nearer realisation said Janetta
There are exceptions of course said Egbert people who really try to infuse a breath of reality into their letters of acknowledgment
Aunt Susan for instance who writes Thank you very much for the ham not such a good flavour as the one you sent last year which itself was not a particularly good one
Hams are not what they used to be
It would be a pity to be deprived of her Christmas comments but that loss would be swallowed up in the general gain
Meanwhile said Janetta what am I to say to the Froplinsons
THE NAMEDAY ADVENTURES according to the proverb are to the adventurous
Quite as often they are to the non adventurous to the retiring to the constitutionally timid
John James Abbleway had been endowed by Nature with the sort of disposition that instinctively avoids Carlist intrigues slum crusades the tracking of wounded wild beasts and the moving of hostile amendments at political meetings
If a mad dog or a Mad Mullah had come his way he would have surrendered the way without hesitation
At school he had unwillingly acquired a thorough knowledge of the German tongue out of deference to the plainlyexpressed wishes of a foreignlanguages master who though he taught modern subjects employed oldfashioned methods in driving his lessons home
It was this enforced familiarity with an important commercial language which thrust Abbleway in later years into strange lands where adventures were less easy to guard against than in the ordered atmosphere of an English country town
The firm that he worked for saw fit to send him one day on a prosaic business errand to the far city of Vienna and having sent him there continued to keep him there still engaged in humdrum affairs of commerce but with the possibilities of romance and adventure or even misadventure jostling at his elbow
After two and a half years of exile however John James Abbleway had embarked on only one hazardous undertaking and that was of a nature which would assuredly have overtaken him sooner or later if he had been leading a sheltered stayathome existence at Dorking or Huntingdon
He fell placidly in love with a placidly lovable English girl the sister of one of his commercial colleagues who was improving her mind by a short trip to foreign parts and in due course he was formally accepted as the young man she was engaged to
The further step by which she was to become Mrs John Abbleway was to take place a twelvemonth hence in a town in the English midlands by which time the firm that employed John James would have no further need for his presence in the Austrian capital
It was early in April two months after the installation of Abbleway as the young man Miss Penning was engaged to when he received a letter from her written from Venice
She was still peregrinating under the wing of her brother and as the latters business arrangements would take him across to Fiume for a day or two she had conceived the idea that it would be rather jolly if John could obtain leave of absence and run down to the Adriatic coast to meet them
She had looked up the route on the map and the journey did not appear likely to be expensive
Between the lines of her communication there lay a hint that if he really cared for her  Abbleway obtained leave of absence and added a journey to Fiume to his lifes adventures
He left Vienna on a cold cheerless day
The flower shops were full of spring blooms and the weekly organs of illustrated humour were full of spring topics but the skies were heavy with clouds that looked like cottonwool that has been kept over long in a shop window
Snow comes said the train official to the station officials and they agreed that snow was about to come
And it came rapidly plenteously
The train had not been more than an hour on its journey when the cotton wool clouds commenced to dissolve in a blinding downpour of snowflakes
The forest trees on either side of the line were speedily coated with a heavy white mantle the telegraph wires became thick glistening ropes the line itself was buried more and more completely under a carpeting of snow through which the not very powerful engine ploughed its way with increasing difficulty
The ViennaFiume line is scarcely the best equipped of the Austrian State railways and Abbleway began to have serious fears for a breakdown
The train had slowed down to a painful and precarious crawl and presently came to a halt at a spot where the drifting snow had accumulated in a formidable barrier
The engine made a special effort and broke through the obstruction but in the course of another twenty minutes it was again held up
The process of breaking through was renewed and the train doggedly resumed its way encountering and surmounting fresh hindrances at frequent intervals
After a standstill of unusually long duration in a particularly deep drift the compartment in which Abbleway was sitting gave a huge jerk and a lurch and then seemed to remain stationary it undoubtedly was not moving and yet he could hear the puffing of the engine and the slow rumbling and jolting of wheels
The puffing and rumbling grew fainter as though it were dying away through the agency of intervening distance
Abbleway suddenly gave vent to an exclamation of scandalised alarm opened the window and peered out into the snowstorm
The flakes perched on his eyelashes and blurred his vision but he saw enough to help him to realise what had happened
The engine had made a mighty plunge through the drift and had gone merrily forward lightened of the load of its rear carriage whose coupling had snapped under the strain
Abbleway was alone or almost alone with a derelict railway waggon in the heart of some Styrian or Croatian forest
In the thirdclass compartment next to his own he remembered to have seen a peasant woman who had entered the train at a small wayside station
With the exception of that woman he exclaimed dramatically to himself the nearest living beings are probably a pack of wolves
Before making his way to the thirdclass compartment to acquaint his fellowtraveller with the extent of the disaster Abbleway hurriedly pondered the question of the womans nationality
He had acquired a smattering of Slavonic tongues during his residence in Vienna and felt competent to grapple with several racial possibilities
If she is Croat or Serb or Bosniak I shall be able to make her understand he promised himself
If she is Magyar heaven help me
We shall have to converse entirely by signs
He entered the carriage and made his momentous announcement in the best approach to Croat speech that he could achieve
The train has broken away and left us
The woman shook her head with a movement that might be intended to convey resignation to the will of heaven but probably meant noncomprehension
Abbleway repeated his information with variations of Slavonic tongues and generous displays of pantomime
Ah said the woman at last in German dialect the train has gone
We are left
Ah so
She seemed about as much interested as though Abbleway had told her the result of the municipal elections in Amsterdam
They will find out at some station and when the line is clear of snow they will send an engine
It happens that way sometimes
We may be here all night
exclaimed Abbleway
The woman nodded as though she thought it possible
Are there wolves in these parts
asked Abbleway hurriedly
Many said the woman just outside this forest my aunt was devoured three years ago as she was coming home from market
The horse and a young pig that was in the cart were eaten too
The horse was a very old one but it was a beautiful young pig oh so fat
I cried when I heard that it was taken
They spare nothing
They may attack us here said Abbleway tremulously they could easily break in these carriages are like matchwood
We may both be devoured
You perhaps said the woman calmly not me
Why not you
demanded Abbleway
It is the day of Saint Maria Kleopha my nameday
She would not allow me to be eaten by wolves on her day
Such a thing could not be thought of
You yes but not me
Abbleway changed the subject
It is only afternoon now if we are to be left here till morning we shall be starving
I have here some good eatables said the woman tranquilly on my festival day it is natural that I should have provision with me
I have five good blood sausages in the town shops they cost twentyfive heller each
Things are dear in the town shops
I will give you fifty heller apiece for a couple of them said Abbleway with some enthusiasm
In a railway accident things become very dear said the woman these bloodsausages are four kronen apiece
Four kronen
exclaimed Abbleway four kronen for a bloodsausage
You cannot get them any cheaper on this train said the woman with relentless logic because there arent any others to get
In Agram you can buy them cheaper and in Paradise no doubt they will be given to us for nothing but here they cost four kronen each
I have a small piece of Emmenthaler cheese and a honeycake and a piece of bread that I can let you have
That will be another three kronen eleven kronen in all
There is a piece of ham but that I cannot let you have on my nameday
Abbleway wondered to himself what price she would have put on the ham and hurried to pay her the eleven kronen before her emergency tariff expanded into a famine tariff
As he was taking possession of his modest store of eatables he suddenly heard a noise which set his heart thumping in a miserable fever of fear
There was a scraping and shuffling as of some animal or animals trying to climb up to the footboard
In another moment through the snowencrusted glass of the carriage window he saw a gaunt prickeared head with gaping jaw and lolling tongue and gleaming teeth a second later another head shot up
There are hundreds of them whispered Abbleway they have scented us
They will tear the carriage to pieces
We shall be devoured
Not me on my nameday
The holy Maria Kleopha would not permit it said the woman with provoking calm
The heads dropped down from the window and an uncanny silence fell on the beleaguered carriage
Abbleway neither moved nor spoke
Perhaps the brutes had not clearly seen or winded the human occupants of the carriage and had prowled away on some other errand of rapine
The long tortureladen minutes passed slowly away
It grows cold said the woman suddenly crossing over to the far end of the carriage where the heads had appeared
The heating apparatus does not work any longer
See over there beyond the trees there is a chimney with smoke coming from it
It is not far and the snow has nearly stopped I shall find a path through the forest to that house with the chimney
But the wolves
exclaimed Abbleway they may   Not on my nameday said the woman obstinately and before he could stop her she had opened the door and climbed down into the snow
A moment later he hid his face in his hands two gaunt lean figures rushed upon her from the forest
No doubt she had courted her fate but Abbleway had no wish to see a human being torn to pieces and devoured before his eyes
When he looked at last a new sensation of scandalised astonishment took possession of him
He had been straitly brought up in a small English town and he was not prepared to be the witness of a miracle
The wolves were not doing anything worse to the woman than drench her with snow as they gambolled round her
A short joyous bark revealed the clue to the situation
Are those  dogs
he called weakly
My cousin Karls dogs yes she answered that is his inn over beyond the trees
I knew it was there but I did not want to take you there he is always grasping with strangers
However it grows too cold to remain in the train
Ah ah see what comes
A whistle sounded and a relief engine made its appearance snorting its way sulkily through the snow
Abbleway did not have the opportunity for finding out whether Karl was really avaricious
THE LUMBER ROOM THE children were to be driven as a special treat to the sands at Jagborough
Nicholas was not to be of the party he was in disgrace
Only that morning he had refused to eat his wholesome breadandmilk on the seemingly frivolous ground that there was a frog in it
Older and wiser and better people had told him that there could not possibly be a frog in his breadandmilk and that he was not to talk nonsense he continued nevertheless to talk what seemed the veriest nonsense and described with much detail the colouration and markings of the alleged frog
The dramatic part of the incident was that there really was a frog in Nicholas basin of breadandmilk he had put it there himself so he felt entitled to know something about it
The sin of taking a frog from the garden and putting it into a bowl of wholesome breadandmilk was enlarged on at great length but the fact that stood out clearest in the whole affair as it presented itself to the mind of Nicholas was that the older wiser and better people had been proved to be profoundly in error in matters about which they had expressed the utmost assurance
You said there couldnt possibly be a frog in my breadandmilk there WAS a frog in my breadandmilk he repeated with the insistence of a skilled tactician who does not intend to shift from favourable ground
So his boycousin and girlcousin and his quite uninteresting younger brother were to be taken to Jagborough sands that afternoon and he was to stay at home
His cousins aunt who insisted by an unwarranted stretch of imagination in styling herself his aunt also had hastily invented the Jagborough expedition in order to impress on Nicholas the delights that he had justly forfeited by his disgraceful conduct at the breakfast table
It was her habit whenever one of the children fell from grace to improvise something of a festival nature from which the offender would be rigorously debarred if all the children sinned collectively they were suddenly informed of a circus in a neighbouring town a circus of unrivalled merit and uncounted elephants to which but for their depravity they would have been taken that very day
A few decent tears were looked for on the part of Nicholas when the moment for the departure of the expedition arrived
As a matter of fact however all the crying was done by his girlcousin who scraped her knee rather painfully against the step of the carriage as she was scrambling in
How she did howl said Nicholas cheerfully as the party drove off without any of the elation of high spirits that should have characterised it
Shell soon get over that said the SOIDISANT aunt it will be a glorious afternoon for racing about over those beautiful sands
How they will enjoy themselves
Bobby wont enjoy himself much and he wont race much either said Nicholas with a grim chuckle his boots are hurting him
Theyre too tight
Why didnt he tell me they were hurting
asked the aunt with some asperity
He told you twice but you werent listening
You often dont listen when we tell you important things
You are not to go into the gooseberry garden said the aunt changing the subject
Why not
demanded Nicholas
Because you are in disgrace said the aunt loftily
Nicholas did not admit the flawlessness of the reasoning he felt perfectly capable of being in disgrace and in a gooseberry garden at the same moment
His face took on an expression of considerable obstinacy
It was clear to his aunt that he was determined to get into the gooseberry garden only as she remarked to herself because I have told him he is not to
Now the gooseberry garden had two doors by which it might be entered and once a small person like Nicholas could slip in there he could effectually disappear from view amid the masking growth of artichokes raspberry canes and fruit bushes
The aunt had many other things to do that afternoon but she spent an hour or two in trivial gardening operations among flower beds and shrubberies whence she could keep a watchful eye on the two doors that led to the forbidden paradise
She was a woman of few ideas with immense powers of concentration
Nicholas made one or two sorties into the front garden wriggling his way with obvious stealth of purpose towards one or other of the doors but never able for a moment to evade the aunts watchful eye
As a matter of fact he had no intention of trying to get into the gooseberry garden but it was extremely convenient for him that his aunt should believe that he had it was a belief that would keep her on selfimposed sentryduty for the greater part of the afternoon
Having thoroughly confirmed and fortified her suspicions Nicholas slipped back into the house and rapidly put into execution a plan of action that had long germinated in his brain
By standing on a chair in the library one could reach a shelf on which reposed a fat importantlooking key
The key was as important as it looked it was the instrument which kept the mysteries of the lumberroom secure from unauthorised intrusion which opened a way only for aunts and suchlike privileged persons
Nicholas had not had much experience of the art of fitting keys into keyholes and turning locks but for some days past he had practised with the key of the schoolroom door he did not believe in trusting too much to luck and accident
The key turned stiffly in the lock but it turned
The door opened and Nicholas was in an unknown land compared with which the gooseberry garden was a stale delight a mere material pleasure
Often and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the lumberroom might be like that region that was so carefully sealed from youthful eyes and concerning which no questions were ever answered
It came up to his expectations
In the first place it was large and dimly lit one high window opening on to the forbidden garden being its only source of illumination
In the second place it was a storehouse of unimagined treasures
The auntbyassertion was one of those people who think that things spoil by use and consign them to dust and damp by way of preserving them
Such parts of the house as Nicholas knew best were rather bare and cheerless but here there were wonderful things for the eye to feast on
First and foremost there was a piece of framed tapestry that was evidently meant to be a firescreen
To Nicholas it was a living breathing story he sat down on a roll of Indian hangings glowing in wonderful colours beneath a layer of dust and took in all the details of the tapestry picture
A man dressed in the hunting costume of some remote period had just transfixed a stag with an arrow it could not have been a difficult shot because the stag was only one or two paces away from him in the thicklygrowing vegetation that the picture suggested it would not have been difficult to creep up to a feeding stag and the two spotted dogs that were springing forward to join in the chase had evidently been trained to keep to heel till the arrow was discharged
That part of the picture was simple if interesting but did the huntsman see what Nicholas saw that four galloping wolves were coming in his direction through the wood
There might be more than four of them hidden behind the trees and in any case would the man and his dogs be able to cope with the four wolves if they made an attack
The man had only two arrows left in his quiver and he might miss with one or both of them all one knew about his skill in shooting was that he could hit a large stag at a ridiculously short range
Nicholas sat for many golden minutes revolving the possibilities of the scene he was inclined to think that there were more than four wolves and that the man and his dogs were in a tight corner
But there were other objects of delight and interest claiming his instant attention there were quaint twisted candlesticks in the shape of snakes and a teapot fashioned like a china duck out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come
How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison
And there was a carved sandalwood box packed tight with aromatic cottonwool and between the layers of cottonwool were little brass figures humpnecked bulls and peacocks and goblins delightful to see and to handle
Less promising in appearance was a large square book with plain black covers Nicholas peeped into it and behold it was full of coloured pictures of birds
And such birds
In the garden and in the lanes when he went for a walk Nicholas came across a few birds of which the largest were an occasional magpie or woodpigeon here were herons and bustards kites toucans tigerbitterns brush turkeys ibises golden pheasants a whole portrait gallery of undreamedof creatures
And as he was admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a lifehistory to it the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation of his name came from the gooseberry garden without
She had grown suspicious at his long disappearance and had leapt to the conclusion that he had climbed over the wall behind the sheltering screen of the lilac bushes she was now engaged in energetic and rather hopeless search for him among the artichokes and raspberry canes
Nicholas Nicholas
she screamed you are to come out of this at once
Its no use trying to hide there I can see you all the time
It was probably the first time for twenty years that anyone had smiled in that lumberroom
Presently the angry repetitions of Nicholas name gave way to a shriek and a cry for somebody to come quickly
Nicholas shut the book restored it carefully to its place in a corner and shook some dust from a neighbouring pile of newspapers over it
Then he crept from the room locked the door and replaced the key exactly where he had found it
His aunt was still calling his name when he sauntered into the front garden
Whos calling
he asked
Me came the answer from the other side of the wall didnt you hear me
Ive been looking for you in the gooseberry garden and Ive slipped into the rain water tank
Luckily theres no water in it but the sides are slippery and I cant get out
Fetch the little ladder from under the cherry tree   I was told I wasnt to go into the gooseberry garden said Nicholas promptly
I told you not to and now I tell you that you may came the voice from the rainwater tank rather impatiently
Your voice doesnt sound like aunts objected Nicholas you may be the Evil One tempting me to be disobedient
Aunt often tells me that the Evil One tempts me and that I always yield
This time Im not going to yield
Dont talk nonsense said the prisoner in the tank go and fetch the ladder
Will there be strawberry jam for tea
asked Nicholas innocently
Certainly there will be said the aunt privately resolving that Nicholas should have none of it
Now I know that you are the Evil One and not aunt shouted Nicholas gleefully when we asked aunt for strawberry jam yesterday she said there wasnt any
I know there are four jars of it in the store cupboard because I looked and of course you know its there but she doesnt because she said there wasnt any
Oh Devil you HAVE sold yourself
There was an unusual sense of luxury in being able to talk to an aunt as though one was talking to the Evil One but Nicholas knew with childish discernment that such luxuries were not to be overindulged in
He walked noisily away and it was a kitchenmaid in search of parsley who eventually rescued the aunt from the rain water tank
Tea that evening was partaken of in a fearsome silence
The tide had been at its highest when the children had arrived at Jagborough Cove so there had been no sands to play on  a circumstance that the aunt had overlooked in the haste of organising her punitive expedition
The tightness of Bobbys boots had had disastrous effect on his temper the whole of the afternoon and altogether the children could not have been said to have enjoyed themselves
The aunt maintained the frozen muteness of one who has suffered undignified and unmerited detention in a rainwater tank for thirtyfive minutes
As for Nicholas he too was silent in the absorption of one who has much to think about it was just possible he considered that the huntsman would escape with his hounds while the wolves feasted on the stricken stag
FUR YOU look worried dear said Eleanor
I am worried admitted Suzanne not worried exactly but anxious
You see my birthday happens next week   You lucky person interrupted Eleanor my birthday doesnt come till the end of March
Well old Bertram Kneyght is over in England just now from the Argentine
Hes a kind of distant cousin of my mothers and so enormously rich that weve never let the relationship drop out of sight
Even if we dont see him or hear from him for years he is always Cousin Bertram when he does turn up
I cant say hes ever been of much solid use to us but yesterday the subject of my birthday cropped up and he asked me to let him know what I wanted for a present
Now I understand the anxiety observed Eleanor
As a rule when one is confronted with a problem like that said Suzanne all ones ideas vanish one doesnt seem to have a desire in the world
Now it so happens that I have been very keen on a little Dresden figure that I saw somewhere in Kensington about thirty six shillings quite beyond my means
I was very nearly describing the figure and giving Bertram the address of the shop
And then it suddenly struck me that thirtysix shillings was such a ridiculously inadequate sum for a man of his immense wealth to spend on a birthday present
He could give thirtysix pounds as easily as you or I could buy a bunch of violets
I dont want to be greedy of course but I dont like being wasteful
The question is said Eleanor what are his ideas as to presentgiving
Some of the wealthiest people have curiously cramped views on that subject
When people grow gradually rich their requirements and standard of living expand in proportion while their presentgiving instincts often remain in the undeveloped condition of their earlier days
Something showy and nottoo expensive in a shop is their only conception of the ideal gift
That is why even quite good shops have their counters and windows crowded with things worth about four shillings that look as if they might be worth sevenand six and are priced at ten shillings and labelled seasonable gifts
 I know said Suzanne that is why it is so risky to be vague when one is giving indications of ones wants
Now if I say to him I am going out to Davos this winter so anything in the travelling line would be acceptable he might give me a dressingbag with gold mounted fittings but on the other hand he might give me Baedekers Switzerland or Skiing without Tears or something of that sort
He would be more likely to say Shell be going to lots of dances a fan will be sure to be useful
 Yes and Ive got tons of fans so you see where the danger and anxiety lies
Now if there is one thing more than another that I really urgently want it is furs
I simply havent any
Im told that Davos is full of Russians and they are sure to wear the most lovely sables and things
To be among people who are smothered in furs when one hasnt any oneself makes one want to break most of the Commandments
If its furs that youre out for said Eleanor you will have to superintend the choice of them in person
You cant be sure that your cousin knows the difference between silverfox and ordinary squirrel
There are some heavenly silverfox stoles at Goliath and Mastodons said Suzanne with a sigh if I could only inveigle Bertram into their building and take him for a stroll through the fur department
He lives somewhere near there doesnt he
said Eleanor
Do you know what his habits are
Does he take a walk at any particular time of day
He usually walks down to his club about three oclock if its a fine day
That takes him right past Goliath and Mastodons
Let us two meet him accidentally at the street corner tomorrow said Eleanor we can walk a little way with him and with luck we ought to be able to side track him into the shop
You can say you want to get a hairnet or something
When were safely there I can say I wish youd tell me what you want for your birthday
Then youll have everything ready to hand  the rich cousin the fur department and the topic of birthday presents
Its a great idea said Suzanne you really are a brick
Come round tomorrow at twenty to three dont be late we must carry out our ambush to the minute
At a few minutes to three the next afternoon the furtrappers walked warily towards the selected corner
In the near distance rose the colossal pile of Messrs Goliath and Mastodons famed establishment
The afternoon was brilliantly fine exactly the sort of weather to tempt a gentleman of advancing years into the discreet exercise of a leisurely walk
I say dear I wish youd do something for me this evening said Eleanor to her companion just drop in after dinner on some pretext or other and stay on to make a fourth at bridge with Adela and the aunts
Otherwise I shall have to play and Harry Scarisbrooke is going to come in unexpectedly about ninefifteen and I particularly want to be free to talk to him while the others are playing
Sorry my dear no can do said Suzanne ordinary bridge at threepence a hundred with such dreadfully slow players as your aunts bores me to tears
I nearly go to sleep over it
But I most particularly want an opportunity to talk with Harry urged Eleanor an angry glint coming into her eyes
Sorry anything to oblige but not that said Suzanne cheerfully the sacrifices of friendship were beautiful in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them
Eleanor said nothing further on the subject but the corners of her mouth rearranged themselves
Theres our man
exclaimed Suzanne suddenly hurry
Mr Bertram Kneyght greeted his cousin and her friend with genuine heartiness and readily accepted their invitation to explore the crowded mart that stood temptingly at their elbow
The plateglass doors swung open and the trio plunged bravely into the jostling throng of buyers and loiterers
Is it always as full as this
asked Bertram of Eleanor
More or less and autumn sales are on just now she replied
Suzanne in her anxiety to pilot her cousin to the desired haven of the fur department was usually a few paces ahead of the others coming back to them now and then if they lingered for a moment at some attractive counter with the nervous solicitude of a parent rook encouraging its young ones on their first flying expedition
Its Suzannes birthday on Wednesday next confided Eleanor to Bertram Kneyght at a moment when Suzanne had left them unusually far behind my birthday comes the day before so we are both on the lookout for something to give each other
Ah said Bertram
Now perhaps you can advise me on that very point
I want to give Suzanne something and I havent the least idea what she wants
Shes rather a problem said Eleanor
She seems to have everything one can think of lucky girl
A fan is always useful shell be going to a lot of dances at Davos this winter
Yes I should think a fan would please her more than anything
After our birthdays are over we inspect each others muster of presents and I always feel dreadfully humble
She gets such nice things and I never have anything worth showing
You see none of my relations or any of the people who give me presents are at all well off so I cant expect them to do anything more than just remember the day with some little trifle
Two years ago an uncle on my mothers side of the family who had come into a small legacy promised me a silverfox stole for my birthday
I cant tell you how excited I was about it how I pictured myself showing it off to all my friends and enemies
Then just at that moment his wife died and of course poor man he could not be expected to think of birthday presents at such a time
He has lived abroad ever since and I never got my fur
Do you know to this day I can scarcely look at a silverfox pelt in a shop window or round anyones neck without feeling ready to burst into tears
I suppose if I hadnt had the prospect of getting one I shouldnt feel that way
Look there is the fan counter on your left you can easily slip away in the crowd
Get her as nice a one as you can see  she is such a dear dear girl
Hullo I thought I had lost you said Suzanne making her way through an obstructive knot of shoppers
Where is Bertram
I got separated from him long ago
I thought he was on ahead with you said Eleanor
We shall never find him in this crush
Which turned out to be a true prediction
All our trouble and forethought thrown away said Suzanne sulkily when they had pushed their way fruitlessly through half a dozen departments
I cant think why you didnt grab him by the arm said Eleanor I would have if Id known him longer but Id only just been introduced
Its nearly four now wed better have tea
Some days later Suzanne rang Eleanor up on the telephone
Thank you very much for the photograph frame
It was just what I wanted
Very good of you
I say do you know what that Kneyght person has given me
Just what you said he would  a wretched fan
What
Oh yes quite a good enough fan in its way but still 


You must come and see what hes given me came in Eleanors voice over the phone
You
Why should he give you anything
Your cousin appears to be one of those rare people of wealth who take a pleasure in giving good presents came the reply
I wondered why he was so anxious to know where she lived snapped Suzanne to herself as she rang off
A cloud has arisen between the friendships of the two young women as far as Eleanor is concerned the cloud has a silverfox lining
THE PHILANTHROPIST AND THE HAPPY CAT JOCANTHA BESSBURY was in the mood to be serenely and graciously happy
Her world was a pleasant place and it was wearing one of its pleasantest aspects
Gregory had managed to get home for a hurried lunch and a smoke afterwards in the little snuggery the lunch had been a good one and there was just time to do justice to the coffee and cigarettes
Both were excellent in their way and Gregory was in his way an excellent husband
Jocantha rather suspected herself of making him a very charming wife and more than suspected herself of having a firstrate dressmaker
I dont suppose a more thoroughly contented personality is to be found in all Chelsea observed Jocantha in allusion to herself except perhaps Attab she continued glancing towards the large tabbymarked cat that lay in considerable ease in a corner of the divan
He lies there purring and dreaming shifting his limbs now and then in an ecstasy of cushioned comfort
He seems the incarnation of everything soft and silky and velvety without a sharp edge in his composition a dreamer whose philosophy is sleep and let sleep and then as evening draws on he goes out into the garden with a red glint in his eyes and slays a drowsy sparrow
As every pair of sparrows hatches out ten or more young ones in the year while their food supply remains stationary it is just as well that the Attabs of the community should have that idea of how to pass an amusing afternoon said Gregory
Having delivered himself of this sage comment he lit another cigarette bade Jocantha a playfully affectionate goodbye and departed into the outer world
Remember dinners a wee bit earlier tonight as were going to the Haymarket she called after him
Left to herself Jocantha continued the process of looking at her life with placid introspective eyes
If she had not everything she wanted in this world at least she was very well pleased with what she had got
She was very well pleased for instance with the snuggery which contrived somehow to be cosy and dainty and expensive all at once
The porcelain was rare and beautiful the Chinese enamels took on wonderful tints in the firelight the rugs and hangings led the eye through sumptuous harmonies of colouring
It was a room in which one might have suitably entertained an ambassador or an archbishop but it was also a room in which one could cut out pictures for a scrapbook without feeling that one was scandalising the deities of the place with ones litter
And as with the snuggery so with the rest of the house and as with the house so with the other departments of Jocanthas life she really had good reason for being one of the most contented women in Chelsea
From being in a mood of simmering satisfaction with her lot she passed to the phase of being generously commiserating for those thousands around her whose lives and circumstances were dull cheap pleasureless and empty
Work girls shop assistants and so forth the class that have neither the happygolucky freedom of the poor nor the leisured freedom of the rich came specially within the range of her sympathy
It was sad to think that there were young people who after a long days work had to sit alone in chill dreary bedrooms because they could not afford the price of a cup of coffee and a sandwich in a restaurant still less a shilling for a theatre gallery
Jocanthas mind was still dwelling on this theme when she started forth on an afternoon campaign of desultory shopping it would be rather a comforting thing she told herself if she could do something on the spur of the moment to bring a gleam of pleasure and interest into the life of even one or two wistful hearted emptypocketed workers it would add a good deal to her sense of enjoyment at the theatre that night
She would get two upper circle tickets for a popular play make her way into some cheap teashop and present the tickets to the first couple of interesting work girls with whom she could casually drop into conversation
She could explain matters by saying that she was unable to use the tickets herself and did not want them to be wasted and on the other hand did not want the trouble of sending them back
On further reflection she decided that it might be better to get only one ticket and give it to some lonelylooking girl sitting eating her frugal meal by herself the girl might scrape acquaintance with her nextseat neighbour at the theatre and lay the foundations of a lasting friendship
With the Fairy Godmother impulse strong upon her Jocantha marched into a ticket agency and selected with immense care an upper circle seat for the Yellow Peacock a play that was attracting a considerable amount of discussion and criticism
Then she went forth in search of a teashop and philanthropic adventure at about the same time that Attab sauntered into the garden with a mind attuned to sparrow stalking
In a corner of an ABC
shop she found an unoccupied table whereat she promptly installed herself impelled by the fact that at the next table was sitting a young girl rather plain of feature with tired listless eyes and a general air of uncomplaining forlornness
Her dress was of poor material but aimed at being in the fashion her hair was pretty and her complexion bad she was finishing a modest meal of tea and scone and she was not very different in her way from thousands of other girls who were finishing or beginning or continuing their teas in London teashops at that exact moment
The odds were enormously in favour of the supposition that she had never seen the Yellow Peacock obviously she supplied excellent material for Jocanthas first experiment in haphazard benefaction
Jocantha ordered some tea and a muffin and then turned a friendly scrutiny on her neighbour with a view to catching her eye
At that precise moment the girls face lit up with sudden pleasure her eyes sparkled a flush came into her cheeks and she looked almost pretty
A young man whom she greeted with an affectionate Hullo Bertie came up to her table and took his seat in a chair facing her
Jocantha looked hard at the new comer he was in appearance a few years younger than herself very much better looking than Gregory rather better looking in fact than any of the young men of her set
She guessed him to be a wellmannered young clerk in some wholesale warehouse existing and amusing himself as best he might on a tiny salary and commanding a holiday of about two weeks in the year
He was aware of course of his good looks but with the shy self consciousness of the AngloSaxon not the blatant complacency of the Latin or Semite
He was obviously on terms of friendly intimacy with the girl he was talking to probably they were drifting towards a formal engagement
Jocantha pictured the boys home in a rather narrow circle with a tiresome mother who always wanted to know how and where he spent his evenings
He would exchange that humdrum thraldom in due course for a home of his own dominated by a chronic scarcity of pounds shillings and pence and a dearth of most of the things that made life attractive or comfortable
Jocantha felt extremely sorry for him
She wondered if he had seen the Yellow Peacock the odds were enormously in favour of the supposition that he had not
The girl had finished her tea and would shortly be going back to her work when the boy was alone it would be quite easy for Jocantha to say My husband has made other arrangements for me this evening would you care to make use of this ticket which would otherwise be wasted
Then she could come there again one afternoon for tea and if she saw him ask him how he liked the play
If he was a nice boy and improved on acquaintance he could be given more theatre tickets and perhaps asked to come one Sunday to tea at Chelsea
Jocantha made up her mind that he would improve on acquaintance and that Gregory would like him and that the Fairy Godmother business would prove far more entertaining than she had originally anticipated
The boy was distinctly presentable he knew how to brush his hair which was possibly an imitative faculty he knew what colour of tie suited him which might be intuition he was exactly the type that Jocantha admired which of course was accident
Altogether she was rather pleased when the girl looked at the clock and bade a friendly but hurried farewell to her companion
Bertie nodded goodbye gulped down a mouthful of tea and then produced from his overcoat pocket a papercovered book bearing the title Sepoy and Sahib a tale of the great Mutiny
The laws of teashop etiquette forbid that you should offer theatre tickets to a stranger without having first caught the strangers eye
It is even better if you can ask to have a sugar basin passed to you having previously concealed the fact that you have a large and wellfilled sugar basin on your own table this is not difficult to manage as the printed menu is generally nearly as large as the table and can be made to stand on end
Jocantha set to work hopefully she had a long and rather highpitched discussion with the waitress concerning alleged defects in an altogether blameless muffin she made loud and plaintive inquiries about the tube service to some impossibly remote suburb she talked with brilliant insincerity to the teashop kitten and as a last resort she upset a milkjug and swore at it daintily
Altogether she attracted a good deal of attention but never for a moment did she attract the attention of the boy with the beautifullybrushed hair who was some thousands of miles away in the baking plains of Hindostan amid deserted bungalows seething bazaars and riotous barrack squares listening to the throbbing of tomtoms and the distant rattle of musketry
Jocantha went back to her house in Chelsea which struck her for the first time as looking dull and over furnished
She had a resentful conviction that Gregory would be uninteresting at dinner and that the play would be stupid after dinner
On the whole her frame of mind showed a marked divergence from the purring complacency of Attab who was again curled up in his corner of the divan with a great peace radiating from every curve of his body
But then he had killed his sparrow
ON APPROVAL OF all the genuine Bohemians who strayed from time to time into the wouldbe Bohemian circle of the Restaurant Nuremberg Owl Street Soho none was more interesting and more elusive than Gebhard Knopfschrank
He had no friends and though he treated all the restaurant frequenters as acquaintances he never seemed to wish to carry the acquaintanceship beyond the door that led into Owl Street and the outer world
He dealt with them all rather as a market woman might deal with chance passersby exhibiting her wares and chattering about the weather and the slackness of business occasionally about rheumatism but never showing a desire to penetrate into their daily lives or to dissect their ambitions
He was understood to belong to a family of peasant farmers somewhere in Pomerania some two years ago according to all that was known of him he had abandoned the labours and responsibilities of swine tending and goose rearing to try his fortune as an artist in London
Why London and not Paris or Munich
he had been asked by the curious
Well there was a ship that left Stolpmunde for London twice a month that carried few passengers but carried them cheaply the railway fares to Munich or Paris were not cheap
Thus it was that he came to select London as the scene of his great adventure
The question that had long and seriously agitated the frequenters of the Nuremberg was whether this goose boy migrant was really a souldriven genius spreading his wings to the light or merely an enterprising young man who fancied he could paint and was pardonably anxious to escape from the monotony of rye bread diet and the sandy swinebestrewn plains of Pomerania
There was reasonable ground for doubt and caution the artistic groups that foregathered at the little restaurant contained so many young women with short hair and so many young men with long hair who supposed themselves to be abnormally gifted in the domain of music poetry painting or stagecraft with little or nothing to support the supposition that a selfannounced genius of any sort in their midst was inevitably suspect
On the other hand there was the everimminent danger of entertaining and snubbing an angel unawares
There had been the lamentable case of Sledonti the dramatic poet who had been belittled and coldshouldered in the Owl Street hall of judgment and had been afterwards hailed as a master singer by the Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovitch  the most educated of the Romanoffs according to Sylvia Strubble who spoke rather as one who knew every individual member of the Russian imperial family as a matter of fact she knew a newspaper correspondent a young man who ate BORTSCH with the air of having invented it
Sledontis Poems of Death and Passion were now being sold by the thousand in seven European languages and were about to be translated into Syrian a circumstance which made the discerning critics of the Nuremberg rather shy of maturing their future judgments too rapidly and too irrevocably
As regards Knopfschranks work they did not lack opportunity for inspecting and appraising it
However resolutely he might hold himself aloof from the social life of his restaurant acquaintances he was not minded to hide his artistic performances from their inquiring gaze
Every evening or nearly every evening at about seven oclock he would make his appearance sit himself down at his accustomed table throw a bulky black portfolio on to the chair opposite him nod round indiscriminately at his fellowguests and commence the serious business of eating and drinking
When the coffee stage was reached he would light a cigarette draw the portfolio over to him and begin to rummage among its contents
With slow deliberation he would select a few of his more recent studies and sketches and silently pass them round from table to table paying especial attention to any new diners who might be present
On the back of each sketch was marked in plain figures the announcement Price ten shillings
If his work was not obviously stamped with the hall mark of genius at any rate it was remarkable for its choice of an unusual and unvarying theme
His pictures always represented some wellknown street or public place in London fallen into decay and denuded of its human population in the place of which there roamed a wild fauna which from its wealth of exotic species must have originally escaped from Zoological Gardens and travelling beast shows
Giraffes drinking at the fountain pools Trafalgar Square was one of the most notable and characteristic of his studies while even more sensational was the gruesome picture of Vultures attacking dying camel in Upper Berkeley Street
There were also photographs of the large canvas on which he had been engaged for some months and which he was now endeavouring to sell to some enterprising dealer or adventurous amateur
The subject was Hyaenas asleep in Euston Station a composition that left nothing to be desired in the way of suggesting unfathomed depths of desolation
Of course it may be immensely clever it may be something epochmaking in the realm of art said Sylvia Strubble to her own particular circle of listeners but on the other hand it may be merely mad
One mustnt pay too much attention to the commercial aspect of the case of course but still if some dealer would make a bid for that hyaena picture or even for some of the sketches we should know better how to place the man and his work
We may all be cursing ourselves one of these days said Mrs NougatJones for not having bought up his entire portfolio of sketches
At the same time when there is so much real talent going about one does not feel like planking down ten shillings for what looks like a bit of whimsical oddity
Now that picture that he showed us last week Sandgrouse roosting on the Albert Memorial was very impressive and of course I could see there was good workmanship in it and breadth of treatment but it didnt in the least convey the Albert Memorial to me and Sir James Beanquest tells me that sandgrouse dont roost they sleep on the ground
Whatever talent or genius the Pomeranian artist might possess it certainly failed to receive commercial sanction
The portfolio remained bulky with unsold sketches and the Euston Siesta as the wits of the Nuremberg nicknamed the large canvas was still in the market
The outward and visible signs of financial embarrassment began to be noticeable the halfbottle of cheap claret at dinnertime gave way to a small glass of lager and this in turn was displaced by water
The one andsixpenny set dinner receded from an everyday event to a Sunday extravagance on ordinary days the artist contented himself with a sevenpenny omelette and some bread and cheese and there were evenings when he did not put in an appearance at all
On the rare occasions when he spoke of his own affairs it was observed that he began to talk more about Pomerania and less about the great world of art
It is a busy time there now with us he said wistfully the schwines are driven out into the fields after harvest and must be looked after
I could be helping to look after if I was there
Here it is difficult to live art is not appreciate
Why dont you go home on a visit
some one asked tactfully
Ah it cost money
There is the ship passage to Stolpmunde and there is money that I owe at my lodgings
Even here I owe a few schillings
If I could sell some of my sketches   Perhaps suggested Mrs NougatJones if you were to offer them for a little less some of us would be glad to buy a few
Ten shillings is always a consideration you know to people who are not over well off
Perhaps if you were to ask six or seven shillings   Once a peasant always a peasant
The mere suggestion of a bargain to be struck brought a twinkle of awakened alertness into the artists eyes and hardened the lines of his mouth
Nine schilling nine pence each he snapped and seemed disappointed that Mrs NougatJones did not pursue the subject further
He had evidently expected her to offer seven and fourpence
The weeks sped by and Knopfschrank came more rarely to the restaurant in Owl Street while his meals on those occasions became more and more meagre
And then came a triumphal day when he appeared early in the evening in a high state of elation and ordered an elaborate meal that scarcely stopped short of being a banquet
The ordinary resources of the kitchen were supplemented by an imported dish of smoked goosebreast a Pomeranian delicacy that was luckily procurable at a firm of DELIKATESSEN merchants in Coventry Street while a longnecked bottle of Rhine wine gave a finishing touch of festivity and good cheer to the crowded table
He has evidently sold his masterpiece whispered Sylvia Strubble to Mrs NougatJones who had come in late
Who has bought it
she whispered back
Dont know he hasnt said anything yet but it must be some American
Do you see he has got a little American flag on the dessert dish and he has put pennies in the music box three times once to play the Star spangled Banner then a Sousa march and then the Star spangled Banner again
It must be an American millionaire and hes evidently got a very big price for it hes just beaming and chuckling with satisfaction
We must ask him who has bought it said Mrs NougatJones
Hush
no dont
Lets buy some of his sketches quick before we are supposed to know that hes famous otherwise hell be doubling the prices
I am so glad hes had a success at last
I always believed in him you know
For the sum of ten shillings each Miss Strubble acquired the drawings of the camel dying in Upper Berkeley Street and of the giraffes quenching their thirst in Trafalgar Square at the same price Mrs NougatJones secured the study of roosting sandgrouse
A more ambitious picture Wolves and wapiti fighting on the steps of the Athenaeum Club found a purchaser at fifteen shillings
And now what are your plans
asked a young man who contributed occasional paragraphs to an artistic weekly
I go back to Stolpmunde as soon as the ship sails said the artist and I do not return
Never
But your work
Your career as painter
Ah there is nossing in it
One starves
Till to day I have sold not one of my sketches
Tonight you have bought a few because I am going away from you but at other times not one
But has not some American  
Ah the rich American chuckled the artist
God be thanked
He dash his car right into our herd of schwines as they were being driven out to the fields
Many of our best schwines he killed but he paid all damages
He paid perhaps more than they were worth many times more than they would have fetched in the market after a month of fattening but he was in a hurry to get on to Dantzig
When one is in a hurry one must pay what one is asked
God be thanked for rich Americans who are always in a hurry to get somewhere else
My father and mother they have now so plenty of money they send me some to pay my debts and come home
I start on Monday for Stolpmunde and I do not come back
Never
But your picture the hyaenas
No good
It is too big to carry to Stolpmunde
I burn it
In time he will be forgotten but at present Knopfschrank is almost as sore a subject as Sledonti with some of the frequenters of the Nuremberg Restaurant Owl Street Soho
