THE GOLDEN ROAD By L M MONTGOMERY Life was a roselipped comrade With purple flowers dripping from her fingers
The Author
TO THE MEMORY OF Aunt Mary Lawson WHO TOLD ME MANY OF THE TALES REPEATED BY THE STORY GIRL FOREWORD Once upon a time we all walked on the golden road
It was a fair highway through the Land of Lost Delight shadow and sunshine were blessedly mingled and every turn and dip revealed a fresh charm and a new loveliness to eager hearts and unspoiled eyes
On that road we heard the song of morning stars we drank in fragrances aerial and sweet as a May mist we were rich in gossamer fancies and iris hopes our hearts sought and found the boon of dreams the years waited beyond and they were very fair life was a roselipped comrade with purple flowers dripping from her fingers
We may long have left the golden road behind but its memories are the dearest of our eternal possessions and those who cherish them as such may haply find a pleasure in the pages of this book whose people are pilgrims on the golden road of youth
THE GOLDEN ROAD CHAPTER I A NEW DEPARTURE Ive thought of something amusing for the winter I said as we drew into a halfcircle around the glorious woodfire in Uncle Alecs kitchen
It had been a day of wild November wind closing down into a wet eerie twilight
Outside the wind was shrilling at the windows and around the eaves and the rain was playing on the roof
The old willow at the gate was writhing in the storm and the orchard was a place of weird music born of all the tears and fears that haunt the halls of night
But little we cared for the gloom and the loneliness of the outside world we kept them at bay with the light of the fire and the laughter of our young lips
We had been having a splendid game of BlindMans Buff
That is it had been splendid at first but later the fun went out of it because we found that Peter was of malice prepense allowing himself to be caught too easily in order that he might have the pleasure of catching Felicitywhich he never failed to do no matter how tightly his eyes were bound
What remarkable goose said that love is blind
Love can see through five folds of closelywoven muffler with ease
Im getting tired said Cecily whose breath was coming rather quickly and whose pale cheeks had bloomed into scarlet
Lets sit down and get the Story Girl to tell us a story
But as we dropped into our places the Story Girl shot a significant glance at me which intimated that this was the psychological moment for introducing the scheme she and I had been secretly developing for some days
It was really the Story Girls idea and none of mine
But she had insisted that I should make the suggestion as coming wholly from myself
If you dont Felicity wont agree to it
You know yourself Bev how contrary shes been lately over anything I mention
And if she goes against it Peter will toothe ninnyand it wouldnt be any fun if we werent all in it
What is it
asked Felicity drawing her chair slightly away from Peters
It is this
Let us get up a newspaper of our ownwrite it all ourselves and have all we do in it
Dont you think we can get a lot of fun out of it
Everyone looked rather blank and amazed except the Story Girl
She knew what she had to do and she did it
What a silly idea
she exclaimed with a contemptuous toss of her long brown curls
Just as if WE could get up a newspaper
Felicity fired up exactly as we had hoped
I think its a splendid idea she said enthusiastically
Id like to know why we couldnt get up as good a newspaper as they have in town
Uncle Roger says the Daily Enterprise has gone to the dogsall the news it prints is that some old woman has put a shawl on her head and gone across the road to have tea with another old woman
I guess we could do better than that
You neednt think Sara Stanley that nobody but you can do anything
I think it would be great fun said Peter decidedly
My Aunt Jane helped edit a paper when she was at Queens Academy and she said it was very amusing and helped her a great deal
The Story Girl could hide her delight only by dropping her eyes and frowning
Bev wants to be editor she said and I dont see how he can with no experience
Anyhow it would be a lot of trouble
Some people are so afraid of a little bother retorted Felicity
I think it would be nice said Cecily timidly and none of us have any experience of being editors any more than Bev so that wouldnt matter
Will it be printed
asked Dan
Oh no I said
We cant have it printed
Well just have to write it outwe can buy foolscap from the teacher
I dont think it will be much of a newspaper if it isnt printed said Dan scornfully
It doesnt matter very much what YOU think said Felicity
Thank you retorted Dan
Of course said the Story Girl hastily not wishing to have Dan turned against our project if all the rest of you want it Ill go in for it too
I daresay it would be real good fun now that I come to think of it
And well keep the copies and when we become famous theyll be quite valuable
I wonder if any of us ever will be famous said Felix
The Story Girl will be I said
I dont see how she can be said Felicity skeptically
Why shes just one of us
Well its decided then that were to have a newspaper I resumed briskly
The next thing is to choose a name for it
Thats a very important thing
How often are you going to publish it
asked Felix
Once a month
I thought newspapers came out every day or every week at least said Dan
We couldnt have one every week I explained
It would be too much work
Well thats an argument admitted Dan
The less work you can get along with the better in my opinion
No Felicity you neednt say it
I know exactly what you want to say so save your breath to cool your porridge
I agree with you that I never work if I can find anything else to do
Remember it is harder still To have no work to do quoted Cecily reprovingly
I dont believe THAT rejoined Dan
Im like the Irishman who said he wished the man who begun work had stayed and finished it
Well is it decided that Bev is to be editor
asked Felix
Of course it is Felicity answered for everybody
Then said Felix I move that the name be The King Monthly Magazine
That sounds fine said Peter hitching his chair a little nearer Felicitys
But said Cecily timidly that will leave out Peter and the Story Girl and Sara Ray just as if they didnt have a share in it
I dont think that would be fair
You name it then Cecily I suggested
Oh
Cecily threw a deprecating glance at the Story Girl and Felicity
Then meeting the contempt in the latters gaze she raised her head with unusual spirit
I think it would be nice just to call it Our Magazine she said
Then wed all feel as if we had a share in it
Our Magazine it will be then I said
And as for having a share in it you bet well all have a share in it
If Im to be editor youll all have to be subeditors and have charge of a department
Oh I couldnt protested Cecily
You must I said inexorably
England expects everyone to do his duty
Thats our mottoonly well put Prince Edward Island in place of England
There must be no shirking
Now what departments will we have
We must make it as much like a real newspaper as we can
Well we ought to have an etiquette department then said Felicity
The Family Guide has one
Of course well have one I said and Dan will edit it
Dan
exclaimed Felicity who had fondly expected to be asked to edit it herself
I can run an etiquette column as well as that idiot in the Family Guide anyhow said Dan defiantly
But you cant have an etiquette department unless questions are asked
What am I to do if nobody asks any
You must make some up said the Story Girl
Uncle Roger says that is what the Family Guide man does
He says it is impossible that there can be as many hopeless fools in the world as that column would stand for otherwise
We want you to edit the household department Felicity I said seeing a cloud lowering on that fair ladys brow
Nobody can do that as well as you
Felix will edit the jokes and the Information Bureau and Cecily must be fashion editor
Yes you must Sis
Its easy as wink
And the Story Girl will attend to the personals
Theyre very important
Anyone can contribute a personal but the Story Girl is to see there are some in every issue even if she has to make them up like Dan with the etiquette
Bev will run the scrap book department besides the editorials said the Story Girl seeing that I was too modest to say it myself
Arent you going to have a story page
asked Peter
We will if youll be fiction and poetry editor I said
Peter in his secret soul was dismayed but he would not blanch before Felicity
All right he said recklessly
We can put anything we like in the scrap book department I explained but all the other contributions must be original and all must have the name of the writer signed to them except the personals
We must all do our best
Our Magazine is to be a feast of reason and flow of soul
I felt that I had worked in two quotations with striking effect
The others with the exception of the Story Girl looked suitably impressed
But said Cecily reproachfully havent you anything for Sara Ray to do
Shell feel awful bad if she is left out
I had forgotten Sara Ray
Nobody except Cecily ever did remember Sara Ray unless she was on the spot
But we decided to put her in as advertising manager
That sounded well and really meant very little
Well well go ahead then I said with a sigh of relief that the project had been so easily launched
Well get the first issue out about the first of January
And whatever else we do we mustnt let Uncle Roger get hold of it
Hed make such fearful fun of it
I hope we can make a success of it said Peter moodily
He had been moody ever since he was entrapped into being fiction editor
It will be a success if we are determined to succeed I said
Where there is a will there is always a way
Thats just what Ursula Townley said when her father locked her in her room the night she was going to run away with Kenneth MacNair said the Story Girl
We pricked up our ears scenting a story
Who were Ursula Townley and Kenneth MacNair
I asked
Kenneth MacNair was a first cousin of the Awkward Mans grandfather and Ursula Townley was the belle of the Island in her day
Who do you suppose told me the storyno read it to me out of his brown book
Never the Awkward Man himself
I exclaimed incredulously
Yes he did said the Story Girl triumphantly
I met him one day last week back in the maple woods when I was looking for ferns
He was sitting by the spring writing in his brown book
He hid it when he saw me and looked real silly but after I had talked to him awhile I just asked him about it and told him that the gossips said he wrote poetry in it and if he did would he tell me because I was dying to know
He said he wrote a little of everything in it and then I begged him to read me something out of it and he read me the story of Ursula and Kenneth
I dont see how you ever had the face said Felicity and even Cecily looked as if she thought the Story Girl had gone rather far
Never mind that cried Felix but tell us the story
Thats the main thing
Ill tell it just as the Awkward Man read it as far as I can said the Story Girl but I cant put all his nice poetical touches in because I cant remember them all though he read it over twice for me
CHAPTER II A WILL A WAY AND A WOMAN One day over a hundred years ago Ursula Townley was waiting for Kenneth MacNair in a great beechwood where brown nuts were falling and an October wind was making the leaves dance on the ground like pixypeople
What are pixypeople
demanded Peter forgetting the Story Girls dislike of interruptions
Hush whispered Cecily
That is only one of the Awkward Mans poetical touches I guess
There were cultivated fields between the grove and the dark blue gulf but far behind and on each side were woods for Prince Edward Island a hundred years ago was not what it is today
The settlements were few and scattered and the population so scanty that old Hugh Townley boasted that he knew every man woman and child in it
Old Hugh was quite a noted man in his day
He was noted for several thingshe was rich he was hospitable he was proud he was masterfuland he had for daughter the handsomest young woman in Prince Edward Island
Of course the young men were not blind to her good looks and she had so many lovers that all the other girls hated her You bet
said Dan aside But the only one who found favour in her eyes was the very last man she should have pitched her fancy on at least if old Hugh were the judge
Kenneth MacNair was a darkeyed young seacaptain of the next settlement and it was to meet him that Ursula stole to the beechwood on that autumn day of crisp wind and ripe sunshine
Old Hugh had forbidden his house to the young man making such a scene of fury about it that even Ursulas high spirit quailed
Old Hugh had really nothing against Kenneth himself but years before either Kenneth or Ursula was born Kenneths father had beaten Hugh Townley in a hotly contested election
Political feeling ran high in those days and old Hugh had never forgiven the MacNair his victory
The feud between the families dated from that tempest in the provincial teapot and the surplus of votes on the wrong side was the reason why thirty years after Ursula had to meet her lover by stealth if she met him at all
Was the MacNair a Conservative or a Grit
asked Felicity
It doesnt make any difference what he was said the Story Girl impatiently
Even a Tory would be romantic a hundred years ago
Well Ursula couldnt see Kenneth very often for Kenneth lived fifteen miles away and was often absent from home in his vessel
On this particular day it was nearly three months since they had met
The Sunday before young Sandy MacNair had been in Carlyle church
He had risen at dawn that morning walked barefooted for eight miles along the shore carrying his shoes hired a harbour fisherman to row him over the channel and then walked eight miles more to the church at Carlyle less it is to be feared from a zeal for holy things than that he might do an errand for his adored brother Kenneth
He carried a letter which he contrived to pass into Ursulas hand in the crowd as the people came out
This letter asked Ursula to meet Kenneth in the beechwood the next afternoon and so she stole away there when suspicious father and watchful stepmother thought she was spinning in the granary loft
It was very wrong of her to deceive her parents said Felicity primly
The Story Girl couldnt deny this so she evaded the ethical side of the question skilfully
I am not telling you what Ursula Townley ought to have done she said loftily
I am only telling you what she DID do
If you dont want to hear it you neednt listen of course
There wouldnt be many stories to tell if nobody ever did anything she shouldnt do
Well when Kenneth came the meeting was just what might have been expected between two lovers who had taken their last kiss three months before
So it was a good halfhour before Ursula said Oh Kenneth I cannot stay longI shall be missed
You said in your letter that you had something important to talk of
What is it
My news is this Ursula
Next Saturday morning my vessel The Fair Lady with her captain on board sails at dawn from Charlottetown harbour bound for Buenos Ayres
At this season this means a safe and sure returnnext May
Kenneth
cried Ursula
She turned pale and burst into tears
How can you think of leaving me
Oh you are cruel
Why no sweetheart laughed Kenneth
The captain of The Fair Lady will take his bride with him
Well spend our honeymoon on the high seas Ursula and the cold Canadian winter under southern palms
You want me to run away with you Kenneth
exclaimed Ursula
Indeed dear girl theres nothing else to do
Oh I cannot
she protested
My father would Well not consult himuntil afterward
Come Ursula you know theres no other way
Weve always known it must come to this
YOUR father will never forgive me for MY father
You wont fail me now
Think of the long parting if you send me away alone on such a voyage
Pluck up your courage and well let Townleys and MacNairs whistle their mouldy feuds down the wind while we sail southward in The Fair Lady
I have a plan
Let me hear it said Ursula beginning to get back her breath
There is to be a dance at The Springs Friday night
Are you invited Ursula
Yes
Good
I am notbut I shall be therein the fir grove behind the house with two horses
When the dancing is at its height youll steal out to meet me
Then tis but a fifteen mile ride to Charlottetown where a good minister who is a friend of mine will be ready to marry us
By the time the dancers have tired their heels you and I will be on our vessel able to snap our fingers at fate
And what if I do not meet you in the fir grove
said Ursula a little impertinently
If you do not Ill sail for South America the next morning and many a long year will pass ere Kenneth MacNair comes home again
Perhaps Kenneth didnt mean that but Ursula thought he did and it decided her
She agreed to run away with him
Yes of course that was wrong too Felicity
She ought to have said No I shall be married respectably from home and have a wedding and a silk dress and bridesmaids and lots of presents
But she didnt
She wasnt as prudent as Felicity King would have been
She was a shameless hussy said Felicity venting on the long dead Ursula that anger she dare not visit on the Story Girl
Oh no Felicity dear she was just a lass of spirit
Id have done the same
And when Friday night came she began to dress for the dance with a brave heart
She was to go to The Springs with her uncle and aunt who were coming on horseback that afternoon and would then go on to The Springs in old Hughs carriage which was the only one in Carlyle then
They were to leave in time to reach The Springs before nightfall for the October nights were dark and the wooded roads rough for travelling
When Ursula was ready she looked at herself in the glass with a good deal of satisfaction
Yes Felicity she was a vain baggage that same Ursula but that kind didnt all die out a hundred years ago
And she had good reason for being vain
She wore the sea green silk which had been brought out from England a year before and worn but onceat the Christmas ball at Government House
A fine stiff rustling silk it was and over it shone Ursulas crimson cheeks and gleaming eyes and masses of nut brown hair
As she turned from the glass she heard her fathers voice below loud and angry
Growing very pale she ran out into the hall
Her father was already half way upstairs his face red with fury
In the hall below Ursula saw her stepmother looking troubled and vexed
At the door stood Malcolm Ramsay a homely neighbour youth who had been courting Ursula in his clumsy way ever since she grew up
Ursula had always hated him
Ursula
shouted old Hugh come here and tell this scoundrel he lies
He says that you met Kenneth MacNair in the beechgrove last Tuesday
Tell him he lies
Tell him he lies
Ursula was no coward
She looked scornfully at poor Ramsay
The creature is a spy and a talebearer she said but in this he does not lie
I DID meet Kenneth MacNair last Tuesday
And you dare to tell me this to my face
roared old Hugh
Back to your room girl
Back to your room and stay there
Take off that finery
You go to no more dances
You shall stay in that room until I choose to let you out
No not a word
Ill put you there if you dont go
In with youay and take your knitting with you
Occupy yourself with that this evening instead of kicking your heels at The Springs
He snatched a roll of gray stocking from the hall table and flung it into Ursulas room
Ursula knew she would have to follow it or be picked up and carried in like a naughty child
So she gave the miserable Ramsay a look that made him cringe and swept into her room with her head in the air
The next moment she heard the door locked behind her
Her first proceeding was to have a cry of anger and shame and disappointment
That did no good and then she took to marching up and down her room
It did not calm her to hear the rumble of the carriage out of the gate as her uncle and aunt departed
Oh whats to be done
she sobbed
Kenneth will be furious
He will think I have failed him and he will go away hot with anger against me
If I could only send a word of explanation I know he would not leave me
But there seems to be no way at allthough I have heard that theres always a way when theres a will
Oh I shall go mad
If the window were not so high I would jump out of it
But to break my legs or my neck would not mend the matter
The afternoon passed on
At sunset Ursula heard hoofbeats and ran to the window
Andrew Kinnear of The Springs was tying his horse at the door
He was a dashing young fellow and a political crony of old Hugh
No doubt he would be at the dance that night
Oh if she could get speech for but a moment with him
When he had gone into the house Ursula turning impatiently from the window tripped and almost fell over the big ball of homespun yarn her father had flung on the floor
For a moment she gazed at it resentfullythen with a gay little laugh she pounced on it
The next moment she was at her table writing a brief note to Kenneth MacNair
When it was written Ursula unwound the gray ball to a considerable depth pinned the note on it and rewound the yarn over it
A gray ball the color of the twilight might escape observation where a white missive fluttering down from an upper window would surely be seen by someone
Then she softly opened her window and waited
It was dusk when Andrew went away
Fortunately old Hugh did not come to the door with him
As Andrew untied his horse Ursula threw the ball with such good aim that it struck him as she had meant it to do squarely on the head
Andrew looked up at her window
She leaned out put her finger warningly on her lips pointed to the ball and nodded
Andrew looking somewhat puzzled picked up the ball sprang to his saddle and galloped off
So far well thought Ursula
But would Andrew understand
Would he have wit enough to think of exploring the big knobby ball for its delicate secret
And would he be at the dance after all
The evening dragged by
Time had never seemed so long to Ursula
She could not rest or sleep
It was midnight before she heard the patter of a handful of gravel on her windowpanes
In a trice she was leaning out
Below in the darkness stood Kenneth MacNair
Oh Kenneth did you get my letter
And is it safe for you to be here
Safe enough
Your father is in bed
Ive waited two hours down the road for his light to go out and an extra halfhour to put him to sleep
The horses are there
Slip down and out Ursula
Well make Charlottetown by dawn yet
Thats easier said than done lad
Im locked in
But do you go out behind the new barn and bring the ladder you will find there
Five minutes later Miss Ursula hooded and cloaked scrambled soundlessly down the ladder and in five more minutes she and Kenneth were riding along the road
Theres a stiff gallop before us Ursula said Kenneth
I would ride to the worlds end with you Kenneth MacNair said Ursula
Oh of course she shouldnt have said anything of the sort Felicity
But you see people had no etiquette departments in those days
And when the red sunlight of a fair October dawn was shining over the gray sea The Fair Lady sailed out of Charlottetown harbour
On her deck stood Kenneth and Ursula MacNair and in her hand as a most precious treasure the bride carried a ball of gray homespun yarn
Well said Dan yawning I like that kind of a story
Nobody goes and dies in it thats one good thing
Did old Hugh forgive Ursula
I asked
The story stopped there in the brown book said the Story Girl but the Awkward Man says he did after awhile
It must be rather romantic to be run away with remarked Cecily wistfully
Dont you get such silly notions in your head Cecily King said Felicity severely
CHAPTER III THE CHRISTMAS HARP Great was the excitement in the houses of King as Christmas drew nigh
The air was simply charged with secrets
Everybody was very penurious for weeks beforehand and hoards were counted scrutinizingly every day
Mysterious pieces of handiwork were smuggled in and out of sight and whispered consultations were held about which nobody thought of being jealous as might have happened at any other time
Felicity was in her element for she and her mother were deep in preparations for the day
Cecily and the Story Girl were excluded from these doings with indifference on Aunt Janets part and what seemed ostentatious complacency on Felicitys
Cecily took this to heart and complained to me about it
Im one of this family just as much as Felicity is she said with as much indignation as Cecily could feel and I dont think she need shut me out of everything
When I wanted to stone the raisins for the mincemeat she said no she would do it herself because Christmas mincemeat was very particularas if I couldnt stone raisins right
The airs Felicity puts on about her cooking just make me sick concluded Cecily wrathfully
Its a pity she doesnt make a mistake in cooking once in a while herself I said
Then maybe she wouldnt think she knew so much more than other people
All parcels that came in the mail from distant friends were taken charge of by Aunts Janet and Olivia not to be opened until the great day of the feast itself
How slowly the last week passed
But even watched pots will boil in the fulness of time and finally Christmas day came gray and dour and frostbitten without but full of revelry and rosered mirth within
Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia and the Story Girl came over early for the day and Peter came too with his shining morning face to be hailed with joy for we had been afraid that Peter would not be able to spend Christmas with us
His mother had wanted him home with her
Of course I ought to go Peter had told me mournfully but we wont have turkey for dinner because ma cant afford it
And ma always cries on holidays because she says they make her think of father
Of course she cant help it but it aint cheerful
Aunt Jane wouldnt have cried
Aunt Jane used to say she never saw the man who was worth spoiling her eyes for
But I guess Ill have to spend Christmas at home
At the last moment however a cousin of Mrs Craigs in Charlottetown invited her for Christmas and Peter being given his choice of going or staying joyfully elected to stay
So we were all together except Sara Ray who had been invited but whose mother wouldnt let her come
Sara Rays mother is a nuisance snapped the Story Girl
She just lives to make that poor child miserable and she wont let her go to the party tonight either
It is just breaking Saras heart that she cant said Cecily compassionately
Im almost afraid I wont enjoy myself for thinking of her home there alone most likely reading the Bible while were at the party
She might be worse occupied than reading the Bible said Felicity rebukingly
But Mrs Ray makes her read it as a punishment protested Cecily
Whenever Sara cries to go anywhereand of course shell cry tonightMrs Ray makes her read seven chapters in the Bible
I wouldnt think that would make her very fond of it
And Ill not be able to talk the party over with Sara afterwardsand thats half the fun gone
You can tell her all about it comforted Felix
Telling isnt a bit like talking it over retorted Cecily
Its too onesided
We had an exciting time opening our presents
Some of us had more than others but we all received enough to make us feel comfortably that we were not unduly neglected in the matter
The contents of the box which the Story Girls father had sent her from Paris made our eyes stick out
It was full of beautiful things among them another red silk dressnot the bright flame hued tint of her old one but a rich dark crimson with the most distracting flounces and bows and ruffles and with it were little red satin slippers with gold buckles and heels that made Aunt Janet hold up her hands in horror
Felicity remarked scornfully that she would have thought the Story Girl would get tired wearing red so much and even Cecily commented apart to me that she thought when you got so many things all at once you didnt appreciate them as much as when you only got a few
Id never get tired of red said the Story Girl
I just love itits so rich and glowing
When Im dressed in red I always feel ever so much cleverer than in any other colour
Thoughts just crowd into my brain one after the other
Oh you darling dressyou dear sheeny redrosy glistening silky thing
She flung it over her shoulder and danced around the kitchen
Dont be silly Sara said Aunt Janet a little stimy
She was a good soul that Aunt Janet and had a kind loving heart in her ample bosom
But I fancy there were times when she thought it rather hard that the daughter of a roving adventureras she considered himlike Blair Stanley should disport herself in silk dresses while her own daughters must go clad in gingham and muslinfor those were the days when a feminine creature got one silk dress in her lifetime and seldom more than one
The Story Girl also got a present from the Awkward Mana little shabby worn volume with a great many marks on the leaves
Why it isnt newits an old book
exclaimed Felicity
I didnt think the Awkward Man was mean whatever else he was
Oh you dont understand Felicity said the Story Girl patiently
And I dont suppose I can make you understand
But Ill try
Id ten times rather have this than a new book
Its one of his own dont you seeone that he has read a hundred times and loved and made a friend of
A new book just out of a shop wouldnt be the same thing at all
It wouldnt MEAN anything
I consider it a great compliment that he has given me this book
Im prouder of it than of anything else Ive got
Well youre welcome to it said Felicity
I dont understand and I dont want to
I wouldnt give anybody a Christmas present that wasnt new and I wouldnt thank anybody who gave me one
Peter was in the seventh heaven because Felicity had given him a presentand moreover one that she had made herself
It was a bookmark of perforated cardboard with a gorgeous red and yellow worsted goblet worked on it and below in green letters the solemn warning Touch Not The Cup
As Peter was not addicted to habits of intemperance not even to looking on dandelion wine when it was pale yellow we did not exactly see why Felicity should have selected such a device
But Peter was perfectly satisfied so nobody cast any blight on his happiness by carping criticism
Later on Felicity told me she had worked the bookmark for him because his father used to drink before he ran away
I thought Peter ought to be warned in time she said
Even Pat had a ribbon of blue which he clawed off and lost half an hour after it was tied on him
Pat did not care for vain adornments of the body
We had a glorious Christmas dinner fit for the halls of Lucullus and ate far more than was good for us none daring to make us afraid on that one day of the year
And in the eveningoh rapture and delightwe went to Kitty Marrs party
It was a fine December evening the sharp air of morning had mellowed until it was as mild as autumn
There had been no snow and the long fields sloping down from the homestead were brown and mellow
A weird dreamy stillness had fallen on the purple earth the dark fir woods the valley rims the sere meadows
Nature seemed to have folded satisfied hands to rest knowing that her long wintry slumber was coming upon her
At first when the invitations to the party had come Aunt Janet had said we could not go but Uncle Alec interceded in our favour perhaps influenced thereto by Cecilys wistful eyes
If Uncle Alec had a favourite among his children it was Cecily and he had grown even more indulgent towards her of late
Now and then I saw him looking at her intently and following his eyes and thought I had somehow seen that Cecily was paler and thinner than she had been in the summer and that her soft eyes seemed larger and that over her little face in moments of repose there was a certain languor and weariness that made it very sweet and pathetic
And I heard him tell Aunt Janet that he did not like to see the child getting so much the look of her Aunt Felicity
Cecily is perfectly well said Aunt Janet sharply
Shes only growing very fast
Dont be foolish Alec
But after that Cecily had cups of cream where the rest of us got only milk and Aunt Janet was very particular to see that she had her rubbers on whenever she went out
On this merry Christmas evening however no fears or dim foreshadowings of any coming event clouded our hearts or faces
Cecily looked brighter and prettier than I had ever seen her with her softly shining eyes and the nut brown gloss of her hair
Felicity was too beautiful for words and even the Story Girl between excitement and the crimson silk array blossomed out with a charm and allurement more potent than any regular loveliness and this in spite of the fact that Aunt Olivia had tabooed the red satin slippers and mercilessly decreed that stout shoes should be worn
I know just how you feel about it you daughter of Eve she said with gay sympathy but December roads are damp and if you are going to walk to Marrs you are not going to do it in those frivolous Parisian concoctions even with overboots on so be brave dear heart and show that you have a soul above little red satin shoes
Anyhow said Uncle Roger that red silk dress will break the hearts of all the feminine small fry at the party
Youd break their spirits too if you wore the slippers
Dont do it Sara
Leave them one wee loophole of enjoyment
What does Uncle Roger mean
whispered Felicity
He means you girls are all dying of jealousy because of the Story Girls dress said Dan
I am not of a jealous disposition said Felicity loftily and shes entirely welcome to the dresswith a complexion like that
But we enjoyed that party hugely every one of us
And we enjoyed the walk home afterwards through dim enshadowed fields where silvery starbeams lay while Orion trod his stately march above us and a red moon climbed up the black horizons rim
A brook went with us part of the way singing to us through the darka gay irresponsible vagabond of valley and wilderness
Felicity and Peter walked not with us
Peters cup must surely have brimmed over that Christmas night
When we left the Marr house he had boldly said to Felicity May I see you home
And Felicity much to our amazement had taken his arm and marched off with him
The primness of her was indescribable and was not at all ruffled by Dans hoot of derision
As for me I was consumed by a secret and burning desire to ask the Story Girl if I might see HER home but I could not screw my courage to the sticking point
How I envied Peter his easy insouciant manner
I could not emulate him so Dan and Felix and Cecily and the Story Girl and I all walked hand in hand huddling a little closer together as we went through James Frewens woodsfor there are strange harps in a fir grove and who shall say what fingers sweep them
Mighty and sonorous was the music above our heads as the winds of the night stirred the great boughs tossing athwart the starlit sky
Perhaps it was that aeolian harmony which recalled to the Story Girl a legend of elder days
I read such a pretty story in one of Aunt Olivias books last night she said
It was called The Christmas Harp
Would you like to hear it
It seems to me it would just suit this part of the road
There isnt anything aboutabout ghosts in it is there
said Cecily timidly
Oh no I wouldnt tell a ghost story here for anything
Id frighten myself too much
This story is about one of the shepherds who saw the angels on the first Christmas night
He was just a youth and he loved music with all his heart and he longed to be able to express the melody that was in his soul
But he could not he had a harp and he often tried to play on it but his clumsy fingers only made such discord that his companions laughed at him and mocked him and called him a madman because he would not give it up but would rather sit apart by himself with his arms about his harp looking up into the sky while they gathered around their fire and told tales to wile away their long night vigils as they watched their sheep on the hills
But to him the thoughts that came out of the great silence were far sweeter than their mirth and he never gave up the hope which sometimes left his lips as a prayer that some day he might be able to express those thoughts in music to the tired weary forgetful world
On the first Christmas night he was out with his fellow shepherds on the hills
It was chill and dark and all except him were glad to gather around the fire
He sat as usual by himself with his harp on his knee and a great longing in his heart
And there came a marvellous light in the sky and over the hills as if the darkness of the night had suddenly blossomed into a wonderful meadow of flowery flame and all the shepherds saw the angels and heard them sing
And as they sang the harp that the young shepherd held began to play softly by itself and as he listened to it he realized that it was playing the same music that the angels sang and that all his secret longings and aspirations and strivings were expressed in it
From that night whenever he took the harp in his hands it played the same music and he wandered all over the world carrying it wherever the sound of its music was heard hate and discord fled away and peace and goodwill reigned
No one who heard it could think an evil thought no one could feel hopeless or despairing or bitter or angry
When a man had once heard that music it entered into his soul and heart and life and became a part of him for ever
Years went by the shepherd grew old and bent and feeble but still he roamed over land and sea that his harp might carry the message of the Christmas night and the angel song to all mankind
At last his strength failed him and he fell by the wayside in the darkness but his harp played as his spirit passed and it seemed to him that a Shining One stood by him with wonderful starry eyes and said to him Lo the music thy harp has played for so many years has been but the echo of the love and sympathy and purity and beauty in thine own soul and if at any time in the wanderings thou hadst opened the door of that soul to evil or envy or selfishness thy harp would have ceased to play
Now thy life is ended but what thou hast given to mankind has no end and as long as the world lasts so long will the heavenly music of the Christmas harp ring in the ears of men
When the sun rose the old shepherd lay dead by the roadside with a smile on his face and in his hands was a harp with all its strings broken
We left the fir woods as the tale was ended and on the opposite hill was home
A dim light in the kitchen window betokened that Aunt Janet had no idea of going to bed until all her young fry were safely housed for the night
Mas waiting up for us said Dan
Id laugh if she happened to go to the door just as Felicity and Peter were strutting up
I guess shell be cross
Its nearly twelve
Christmas will soon be over said Cecily with a sigh
Hasnt it been a nice one
Its the first weve all spent together
Do you suppose well ever spend another together
Lots of em said Dan cheerily
Why not
Oh I dont know answered Cecily her footsteps lagging somewhat
Only things seem just a little too pleasant to last
If Willy Fraser had had as much spunk as Peter Miss Cecily King mightnt be so low spirited quoth Dan significantly
Cecily tossed her head and disdained reply
There are really some remarks a selfrespecting young lady must ignore
CHAPTER IV NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS If we did not have a white Christmas we had a white New Year
Midway between the two came a heavy snowfall
It was winter in our orchard of old delights thenso truly winter that it was hard to believe summer had ever dwelt in it or that spring would ever return to it
There were no birds to sing the music of the moon and the path where the apple blossoms had fallen were heaped with less fragrant drifts
But it was a place of wonder on a moonlight night when the snowy arcades shone like avenues of ivory and crystal and the bare trees cast fairylike traceries upon them
Over Uncle Stephens Walk where the snow had fallen smoothly a spell of white magic had been woven
Taintless and wonderful it seemed like a street of pearl in the new Jerusalem
On New Years Eve we were all together in Uncle Alecs kitchen which was tacitly given over to our revels during the winter evenings
The Story Girl and Peter were there of course and Sara Rays mother had allowed her to come up on condition that she should be home by eight sharp
Cecily was glad to see her but the boys never hailed her arrival with overmuch delight because since the dark began to come down early Aunt Janet always made one of us walk down home with her
We hated this because Sara Ray was always so maddeningly selfconscious of having an escort
We knew perfectly well that next day in school she would tell her chums as a dead secret that SoandSo King saw her home from the hill farm the night before
Now seeing a young lady home from choice and being sent home with her by your aunt or mother are two entirely different things and we thought Sara Ray ought to have sense enough to know it
Outside there was a vivid rose of sunset behind the cold hills of fir and the long reaches of snowy fields glowed fairily pink in the western light
The drifts along the edges of the meadows and down the lane looked as if a series of breaking waves had by the lifting of a magicians wand been suddenly transformed into marble even to their toppling curls of foam
Slowly the splendour died giving place to the mystic beauty of a winter twilight when the moon is rising
The hollow sky was a cup of blue
The stars came out over the white glens and the earth was covered with a kingly carpet for the feet of the young year to press
Im so glad the snow came said the Story Girl
If it hadnt the New Year would have seemed just as dingy and worn out as the old
Theres something very solemn about the idea of a New Year isnt there
Just think of three hundred and sixtyfive whole days with not a thing happened in them yet
I dont suppose anything very wonderful will happen in them said Felix pessimistically
To Felix just then life was flat stale and unprofitable because it was his turn to go home with Sara Ray
It makes me a little frightened to think of all that may happen in them said Cecily
Miss Marwood says it is what we put into a year not what we get out of it that counts at last
Im always glad to see a New Year said the Story Girl
I wish we could do as they do in Norway
The whole family sits up until midnight and then just as the clock is striking twelve the father opens the door and welcomes the New Year in
Isnt it a pretty custom
If ma would let us stay up till twelve we might do that too said Dan but she never will
I call it mean
If I ever have children Ill let them stay up to watch the New Year in said the Story Girl decidedly
So will I said Peter but other nights theyll have to go to bed at seven
You ought to be ashamed speaking of such things said Felicity with a scandalized face
Peter shrank into the background abashed no doubt believing that he had broken some Family Guide precept all to pieces
I didnt know it wasnt proper to mention children he muttered apologetically
We ought to make some New Year resolutions suggested the Story Girl
New Years Eve is the time to make them
I cant think of any resolutions I want to make said Felicity who was perfectly satisfied with herself
I could suggest a few to you said Dan sarcastically
There are so many I would like to make said Cecily that Im afraid it wouldnt be any use trying to keep them all
Well lets all make a few just for the fun of it and see if we can keep them I said
And lets get paper and ink and write them out
That will make them seem more solemn and binding
And then pin them up on our bedroom walls where well see them every day suggested the Story Girl and every time we break a resolution we must put a cross opposite it
That will show us what progress we are making as well as make us ashamed if we have too many crosses
And lets have a Roll of Honour in Our Magazine suggested Felix and every month well publish the names of those who keep their resolutions perfect
I think its all nonsense said Felicity
But she joined our circle around the table though she sat for a long time with a blank sheet before her
Lets each make a resolution in turn I said
Ill lead off
And recalling with shame certain unpleasant differences of opinion I had lately had with Felicity I wrote down in my best hand I shall try to keep my temper always
Youd better said Felicity tactfully
It was Dans turn next
I cant think of anything to start with he said gnawing his penholder fiercely
You might make a resolution not to eat poison berries suggested Felicity
Youd better make one not to nag people everlastingly retorted Dan
Oh dont quarrel the last night of the old year implored Cecily
You might resolve not to quarrel any time suggested Sara Ray
No sir said Dan emphatically
Theres no use making a resolution you CANT keep
There are people in this family youve just GOT to quarrel with if you want to live
But Ive thought of oneI wont do things to spite people
Felicitywho really was in an unbearable mood that nightlaughed disagreeably but Cecily gave her a fierce nudge which probably restrained her from speaking
I will not eat any apples wrote Felix
What on earth do you want to give up eating apples for
asked Peter in astonishment
Never mind returned Felix
Apples make people fat you know said Felicity sweetly
It seems a funny kind of resolution I said doubtfully
I think our resolutions ought to be giving up wrong things or doing right ones
You make your resolutions to suit yourself and Ill make mine to suit myself said Felix defiantly
I shall never get drunk wrote Peter painstakingly
But you never do said the Story Girl in astonishment
Well it will be all the easier to keep the resolution argued Peter
That isnt fair complained Dan
If we all resolved not to do the things we never do wed all be on the Roll of Honour
You let Peter alone said Felicity severely
Its a very good resolution and one everybody ought to make
I shall not be jealous wrote the Story Girl
But are you
I asked surprised
The Story Girl coloured and nodded
Of one thing she confessed but Im not going to tell what it is
Im jealous sometimes too confessed Sara Ray and so my first resolution will be I shall try not to feel jealous when I hear the other girls in school describing all the sick spells theyve had
Goodness do you want to be sick
demanded Felix in astonishment
It makes a person important explained Sara Ray
I am going to try to improve my mind by reading good books and listening to older people wrote Cecily
You got that out of the Sunday School paper cried Felicity
It doesnt matter where I got it said Cecily with dignity
The main thing is to keep it
Its your turn Felicity I said
Felicity tossed her beautiful golden head
I told you I wasnt going to make any resolutions
Go on yourself
I shall always study my grammar lesson I wroteI who loathed grammar with a deadly loathing
I hate grammar too sighed Sara Ray
It seems so unimportant
Sara was rather fond of a big word but did not always get hold of the right one
I rather suspected that in the above instance she really meant uninteresting
I wont get mad at Felicity if I can help it wrote Dan
Im sure I never do anything to make you mad exclaimed Felicity
I dont think its polite to make resolutions about your sisters said Peter
He cant keep it anyway scoffed Felicity
Hes got such an awful temper
Its a family failing flashed Dan breaking his resolution ere the ink on it was dry
There you go taunted Felicity
Ill work all my arithmetic problems without any help scribbled Felix
I wish I could resolve that too sighed Sara Ray but it wouldnt be any use
Id never be able to do those compound multiplication sums the teacher gives us to do at home every night if I didnt get Judy Pineau to help me
Judy isnt a good reader and she cant spell AT ALL but you cant stick her in arithmetic as far as she went herself
I feel sure concluded poor Sara in a hopeless tone that Ill NEVER be able to understand compound multiplication
Multiplication is vexation Division is as bad The rule of three perplexes me And fractions drive me mad quoted Dan
I havent got as far as fractions yet sighed Sara and I hope Ill be too big to go to school before I do
I hate arithmetic but I am PASSIONATELY fond of geography
I will not play tittatx on the fly leaves of my hymn book in church wrote Peter
Mercy did you ever do such a thing
exclaimed Felicity in horror
Peter nodded shamefacedly
Yesthat Sunday Mr Bailey preached
He was so longwinded I got awful tired and anyway he was talking about things I couldnt understand so I played tittatx with one of the Markdale boys
It was the day I was sitting up in the gallery
Well I hope if you ever do the like again you wont do it in OUR pew said Felicity severely
I aint going to do it at all said Peter
I felt sort of mean all the rest of the day
I shall try not to be vexed when people interrupt me when Im telling stories wrote the Story Girl
but it will be hard she added with a sigh
I never mind being interrupted said Felicity
I shall try to be cheerful and smiling all the time wrote Cecily
You are anyway said Sara Ray loyally
I dont believe we ought to be cheerful ALL the time said the Story Girl
The Bible says we ought to weep with those who weep
But maybe it means that were to weep cheerfully suggested Cecily
Sorter as if you were thinking Im very sorry for you but Im mighty glad Im not in the scrape too said Dan
Dan dont be irreverent rebuked Felicity
I know a story about old Mr and Mrs Davidson of Markdale said the Story Girl
She was always smiling and it used to aggravate her husband so one day he said very crossly Old lady what ARE you grinning at
Oh well Abiram everythings so bright and pleasant Ive just got to smile
Not long after there came a time when everything went wrongthe crop failed and their best cow died and Mrs Davidson had rheumatism and finally Mr Davidson fell and broke his leg
But still Mrs Davidson smiled
What in the dickens are you grinning about now old lady
he demanded
Oh well Abiram she said everything is so dark and unpleasant Ive just got to smile
Well said the old man crossly I think you might give your face a rest sometimes
I shall not talk gossip wrote Sara Ray with a satisfied air
Oh dont you think thats a little TOO strict
asked Cecily anxiously
Of course its not right to talk MEAN gossip but the harmless kind doesnt hurt
If I say to you that Emmy MacPhail is going to get a new fur collar this winter THAT is harmless gossip but if I say I dont see how Emmy MacPhail can afford a new fur collar when her father cant pay my father for the oats he got from him that would be MEAN gossip
If I were you Sara Id put MEAN gossip
Sara consented to this amendment
I will be polite to everybody was my third resolution which passed without comment
Ill try not to use slang since Cecily doesnt like it wrote Dan
I think some slang is real cute said Felicity
The Family Guide says its very vulgar grinned Dan
Doesnt it Sara Stanley
Dont disturb me said the Story Girl dreamily
Im just thinking a beautiful thought
Ive thought of a resolution to make cried Felicity
Mr Marwood said last Sunday we should always try to think beautiful thoughts and then our lives would be very beautiful
So I shall resolve to think a beautiful thought every morning before breakfast
Can you only manage one a day
queried Dan
And why before breakfast
I asked
Because its easier to think on an empty stomach said Peter in all good faith
But Felicity shot a furious glance at him
I selected that time she explained with dignity because when Im brushing my hair before my glass in the morning Ill see my resolution and remember it
Mr Marwood meant that ALL our thoughts ought to be beautiful said the Story Girl
If they were people wouldnt be afraid to say what they think
They oughtnt to be afraid to anyhow said Felix stoutly
Im going to make a resolution to say just what I think always
And do you expect to get through the year alive if you do
asked Dan
It might be easy enough to say what you think if you could always be sure just what you DO think said the Story Girl
So often I cant be sure
How would you like it if people always said just what they think to you
asked Felicity
Im not very particular what SOME people think of me rejoined Felix
I notice you dont like to be told by anybody that youre fat retorted Felicity
Oh dear me I do wish you wouldnt all say such sarcastic things to each other said poor Cecily plaintively
It sounds so horrid the last night of the old year
Dear knows where well all be this night next year
Peter its your turn
I will try wrote Peter to say my prayers every night regular and not twice one night because I dont expect to have time the nextlike I did the night before the party he added
I spose you never said your prayers until we got you to go to church said Felicitywho had had no hand in inducing Peter to go to church but had stoutly opposed it as recorded in the first volume of our family history
I did too said Peter
Aunt Jane taught me to say my prayers
Ma hadnt time being as father had run away ma had to wash at night same as in daytime
I shall learn to cook wrote the Story Girl frowning
Youd better resolve not to make puddings of began Felicity then stopped as suddenly as if she had bitten off the rest of her sentence and swallowed it
Cecily had nudged her so she had probably remembered the Story Girls threat that she would never tell another story if she was ever twitted with the pudding she had made from sawdust
But we all knew what Felicity had started to say and the Story Girl dealt her a most uncousinly glance
I will not cry because mother wont starch my aprons wrote Sara Ray
Better resolve not to cry about anything said Dan kindly
Sara Ray shook her head forlornly
That would be too hard to keep
There are times when I HAVE to cry
Its a relief
Not to the folks who have to hear you muttered Dan aside to Cecily
Oh hush whispered Cecily back
Dont go and hurt her feelings the last night of the old year
Is it my turn again
Well Ill resolve not to worry because my hair is not curly
But oh Ill never be able to help wishing it was
Why dont you curl it as you used to do then
asked Dan
You know very well that Ive never put my hair up in curl papers since the time Peter was dying of the measles said Cecily reproachfully
I resolved then I wouldnt because I wasnt sure it was quite right
I will keep my fingernails neat and clean I wrote
There thats four resolutions
Im not going to make any more
Fours enough
I shall always think twice before I speak wrote Felix
Thats an awful waste of time commented Dan but I guess youll need to if youre always going to say what you think
Im going to stop with three said Peter
I will have all the good times I can wrote the Story Girl
THATS what I call sensible said Dan
Its a very easy resolution to keep anyhow commented Felix
I shall try to like reading the Bible wrote Sara Ray
You ought to like reading the Bible without trying to exclaimed Felicity
If you had to read seven chapters of it every time you were naughty I dont believe you would like it either retorted Sara Ray with a flash of spirit
I shall try to believe only half of what I hear was Cecilys concluding resolution
But which half
scoffed Dan
The best half said sweet Cecily simply
Ill try to obey mother ALWAYS wrote Sara Ray with a tremendous sigh as if she fully realized the difficulty of keeping such a resolution
And thats all Im going to make
Felicity has only made one said the Story Girl
I think it better to make just one and keep it than make a lot and break them said Felicity loftily
She had the last word on the subject for it was time for Sara Ray to go and our circle broke up
Sara and Felix departed and we watched them down the lane in the moonlightSara walking demurely in one runner track and Felix stalking grimly along in the other
I fear the romantic beauty of that silver shining night was entirely thrown away on my mischievous brother
And it was as I remember it a most exquisite nighta white poem a frosty starry lyric of light
It was one of those nights on which one might fall asleep and dream happy dreams of gardens of mirth and song feeling all the while through ones sleep the soft splendour and radiance of the white moonworld outside as one hears soft faraway music sounding through the thoughts and words that are born of it
As a matter of fact however Cecily dreamed that night that she saw three full moons in the sky and wakened up crying with the horror of it
CHAPTER V THE FIRST NUMBER OF Our Magazine The first number of Our Magazine was ready on New Years Day and we read it that evening in the kitchen
All our staff had worked nobly and we were enormously proud of the result although Dan still continued to scoff at a paper that wasnt printed
The Story Girl and I read it turnabout while the others except Felix ate apples
It opened with a short EDITORIAL With this number Our Magazine makes its first bow to the public
All the editors have done their best and the various departments are full of valuable information and amusement
The tastefully designed cover is by a famous artist Mr Blair Stanley who sent it to us all the way from Europe at the request of his daughter
Mr Peter Craig our enterprising literary editor contributes a touching love story
Peter aside in a gratified pigs whisper I never was called Mr
before
Miss Felicity Kings essays on Shakespeare is none the worse for being an old school composition as it is new to most of our readers
Miss Cecily King contributes a thrilling article of adventure
The various departments are ably edited and we feel that we have reason to be proud of Our Magazine
But we shall not rest on our oars
Excelsior shall ever be our motto
We trust that each succeeding issue will be better than the one that went before
We are well aware of many defects but it is easier to see them than to remedy them
Any suggestion that would tend to the improvement of Our Magazine will be thankfully received but we trust that no criticism will be made that will hurt anyones feelings
Let us all work together in harmony and strive to make Our Magazine an influence for good and a source of innocent pleasure and let us always remember the words of the poet
The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they while their companions slept Were toiling upwards in the night
Peter IMPRESSIVELYIve read many a worse editorial in the Enterprise
ESSAY ON SHAKESPEARE Shakespeares full name was William Shakespeare
He did not always spell it the same way
He lived in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and wrote a great many plays
His plays are written in dialogue form
Some people think they were not written by Shakespeare but by another man of the same name
I have read some of them because our school teacher says everybody ought to read them but I did not care much for them
There are some things in them I cannot understand
I like the stories of Valeria H Montague in the Family Guide ever so much better
They are more exciting and truer to life
Romeo and Juliet was one of the plays I read
It was very sad
Juliet dies and I dont like stories where people die
I like it better when they all get married especially to dukes and earls
Shakespeare himself was married to Anne Hatheway
They are both dead now
They have been dead a good while
He was a very famous man
FELICITY KING
PETER MODESTLY I dont know much about Shakespeare myself but Ive got a book of his plays that belonged to my Aunt Jane and I guess Ill have to tackle him as soon as I finish with the Bible
THE STORY OF AN ELOPEMENT FROM CHURCH This is a true story
It happened in Markdale to an uncle of my mothers
He wanted to marry Miss Jemima Parr
Felicity says Jemima is not a romantic name for a heroin of a story but I cant help it in this case because it is a true story and her name realy was Jemima
My mothers uncle was named Thomas Taylor
He was poor at that time and so the father of Miss Jemima Parr did not want him for a soninlaw and told him he was not to come near the house or he would set the dog on him
Miss Jemima Parr was very pretty and my mothers uncle Thomas was just crazy about her and she wanted him too
She cried almost every night after her father forbid him to come to the house except the nights she had to sleep or she would have died
And she was so frightened he might try to come for all and get tore up by the dog and it was a bulldog too that would never let go
But mothers uncle Thomas was too cute for that
He waited till one day there was preaching in the Markdale church in the middle of the week because it was sacrament time and Miss Jemima Parr and her family all went because her father was an elder
My mothers uncle Thomas went too and set in the pew just behind Miss Jemima Parrs family
When they all bowed their heads at prayer time Miss Jemima Parr didnt but set bolt uprite and my mothers uncle Thomas bent over and wispered in her ear
I dont know what he said so I cant right it but Miss Jemima Parr blushed that is turned red and nodded her head
Perhaps some people may think that my mothers uncle Thomas shouldent of wispered at prayer time in church but you must remember that Miss Jemima Parrs father had thretened to set the dog on him and that was hard lines when he was a respektable young man though not rich
Well when they were singing the last sam my mothers uncle Thomas got up and went out very quitely and as soon as church was out Miss Jemima Parr walked out too real quick
Her family never suspekted anything and they hung round talking to folks and shaking hands while Miss Jemima Parr and my mothers uncle Thomas were eloping outside
And what do you suppose they eloped in
Why in Miss Jemima Parrs fathers slay
And when he went out they were gone and his slay was gone also his horse
Of course my mothers uncle Thomas didnt steal the horse
He just borroed it and sent it home the next day
But before Miss Jemima Parrs father could get another rig to follow them they were so far away he couldent catch them before they got married
And they lived happy together forever afterwards
Mothers uncle Thomas lived to be a very old man
He died very suddent
He felt quite well when he went to sleep and when he woke up he was dead
PETER CRAIG
MY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE The editor says we must all write up our most exciting adventure for Our Magazine
My most exciting adventure happened a year ago last November
I was nearly frightened to death
Dan says he wouldnt of been scared and Felicity says she would of known what it was but its easy to talk
It happened the night I went down to see Kitty Marr
I thought when I went that Aunt Olivia was visiting there and I could come home with her
But she wasnt there and I had to come home alone
Kitty came a piece of the way but she wouldnt come any further than Uncle James Frewens gate
She said it was because it was so windy she was afraid she would get the toothache and not because she was frightened of the ghost of the dog that haunted the bridge in Uncle James hollow
I did wish she hadnt said anything about the dog because I mightnt of thought about it if she hadnt
I had to go on alone thinking of it
Id heard the story often but Id never believed in it
They said the dog used to appear at one end of the bridge and walk across it with people and vanish when he got to the other end
He never tried to bite anyone but one wouldnt want to meet the ghost of a dog even if one didnt believe in him
I knew there was no such thing as ghosts and I kept saying a paraphrase over to myself and the Golden Text of the next Sunday School lesson but oh how my heart beat when I got near the hollow
It was so dark
You could just see things dim like but you couldnt see what they were
When I got to the bridge I walked along sideways with my back to the railing so I couldnt think the dog was behind me
And then just in the middle of the bridge I met something
It was right before me and it was big and black just about the size of a Newfoundland dog and I thought I could see a white nose
And it kept jumping about from one side of the bridge to the other
Oh I hope none of my readers will ever be so frightened as I was then
I was too frightened to run back because I was afraid it would chase me and I couldnt get past it it moved so quick and then it just made one spring right on me and I felt its claws and I screamed and fell down
It rolled off to one side and laid there quite quiet but I didnt dare move and I dont know what would have become of me if Amos Cowan hadnt come along that very minute with a lantern
And there was me sitting in the middle of the bridge and that awful thing beside me
And what do you think it was but a big umbrella with a white handle
Amos said it was his umbrella and it had blown away from him and he had to go back and get the lantern to look for it
I felt like asking him what on earth he was going about with an umbrella open when it wasent raining
But the Cowans do such queer things
You remember the time Jerry Cowan sold us Gods picture
Amos took me right home and I was thankful for I dont know what would have become of me if he hadnt come along
I couldnt sleep all night and I never want to have any more adventures like that one
CECILY KING
PERSONALS Mr Dan King felt somewhat indisposed the day after Christmas probably as the result of too much mince pie
DAN INDIGNANTLY I wasnt
I only et one piece
Mr Peter Craig thinks he saw the Family Ghost on Christmas Eve
But the rest of us think all he saw was the white calf with the red tail
PETER MUTTERING SULKILYIts a queer calf that would walk up on end and wring its hands
Miss Cecily King spent the night of Dec 20th with Miss Kitty Marr
They talked most of the night about new knitted lace patterns and their beaus and were very sleepy in school next day
CECILY SHARPLYWe never mentioned such things
Patrick Grayfur Esq was indisposed yesterday but seems to be enjoying his usual health today
The King family expect their Aunt Eliza to visit them in January
She is really our greataunt
We have never seen her but we are told she is very deaf and does not like children
So Aunt Janet says we must make ourselves scarece when she comes
Miss Cecily King has undertaken to fill with names a square of the missionary quilt which the Mission Band is making
You pay five cents to have your name embroidered in a corner ten cents to have it in the centre and a quarter if you want it left off altogether
CECILY INDIGNANTLYThat isnt the way at all
ADS
WANTEDA remedy to make a fat boy thin
Address Patient Sufferer care of Our Magazine
FELIX SOURLYSara Ray never got that up
Ill bet it was Dan
Hed better stick to his own department
HOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT Mrs Alexander King killed all her geese the twentieth of December
We all helped pick them
We had one Christmas Day and will have one every fortnight the rest of the winter
The bread was sour last week because mother wouldnt take my advice
I told her it was too warm for it in the corner behind the stove
Miss Felicity King invented a new recete for date cookies recently which everybody said were excelent
I am not going to publish it though because I dont want other people to find it out
ANXIOUS INQUIRERIf you want to remove inkstains place the stain over steam and apply salt and lemon juice
If it was Dan who sent this question in Id advise him to stop wiping his pen on his shirt sleeves and then he wouldnt have so many stains
FELICITY KING
ETIQUETTE DEPARTMENT FlxYes you should offer your arm to a lady when seeing her home but dont keep her standing too long at the gate while you say good night
FELIX ENRAGEDI never asked such a question
CclyNo it is not polite to use Holy Moses or dodgasted in ordinary conversation
Cecily had gone down cellar to replenish the apple plate so this passed without protest
SraNo it isnt polite to cry all the time
As to whether you should ask a young man in it all depends on whether he went home with you of his own accord or was sent by some elderly relative
FltyIt does not break any rule of etiquette if you keep a button off your best young mans coat for a keepsake
But dont take more than one or his mother might miss them
DAN KING
FASHION NOTES Knitted mufflers are much more stylish than crocheted ones this winter
It is nice to have one the same colour as your cap
Red mittens with a black diamond pattern on the back are much run after
Em Frewens grandma knits hers for her
She can knit the double diamond pattern and Em puts on such airs about it but I think the single diamond is in better taste
The new winter hats at Markdale are very pretty
It is so exciting to pick a hat
Boys cant have that fun
Their hats are so much alike
CECILY KING
FUNNY PARAGRAPHS This is a true joke and really happened
There was an old local preacher in New Brunswick one time whose name was Samuel Clask
He used to preach and pray and visit the sick just like a regular minister
One day he was visiting a neighbour who was dying and he prayed the Lord to have mercy on him because he was very poor and had worked so hard all his life that he hadnt much time to attend to religion
And if you dont believe me O Lord Mr Clask finished up with just take a look at his hands
FELIX KING
GENERAL INFORMATION BUREAU DANDo porpoises grow on trees or vines
Ans
Neither
They inhabit the deep sea
FELIX KING
DAN AGGRIEVEDWell Id never heard of porpoises and it sounded like something that grew
But you neednt have gone and put it in the paper
FELIXIt isnt any worse than the things you put in about me that I never asked at all
CECILY SOOTHINGLYOh well boys its all in fun and I think Our Magazine is perfectly elegant
FELICITY FAILING TO SEE THE STORY GIRL AND BEVERLEY EXCHANGING WINKS BEHIND HER BACKIt certainly is though SOME PEOPLE were so opposed to starting it
What harmless happy fooling it all was
How we laughed as we read and listened and devoured apples
Blow high blow low no wind can ever quench the ruddy glow of that faraway winter night in our memories
And though Our Magazine never made much of a stir in the world or was the means of hatching any genius it continued to be capital fun for us throughout the year
CHAPTER VI GREATAUNT ELIZAS VISIT It was a diamond winter day in Februaryclear cold hard brilliant
The sharp blue sky shone the white fields and hills glittered the fringe of icicles around the eaves of Uncle Alecs house sparkled
Keen was the frost and crisp the snow over our world and we young fry of the King households were all agog to enjoy lifefor was it not Saturday and were we not left all alone to keep house
Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia had had their last big kill of market poultry the day before and early in the morning all our grownups set forth to Charlottetown to be gone the whole day
They left us many charges as usual some of which we remembered and some of which we forgot but with Felicity in command none of us dared stray far out of line
The Story Girl and Peter came over of course and we all agreed that we would haste and get the work done in the forenoon that we might have an afternoon of uninterrupted enjoyment
A taffypull after dinner and then a jolly hour of coasting on the hill field before supper were on our programme
But disappointment was our portion
We did manage to get the taffy made but before we could sample the result satisfactorily and just as the girls were finishing with the washing of the dishes Felicity glanced out of the window and exclaimed in tones of dismay Oh dear me heres Greataunt Eliza coming up the lane
Now isnt that too mean
We all looked out to see a tall grayhaired lady approaching the house looking about her with the slightly puzzled air of a stranger
We had been expecting Greataunt Elizas advent for some weeks for she was visiting relatives in Markdale
We knew she was liable to pounce down on us any time being one of those delightful folk who like to surprise people but we had never thought of her coming that particular day
It must be confessed that we did not look forward to her visit with any pleasure
None of us had ever seen her but we knew she was very deaf and had very decided opinions as to the way in which children should behave
Whew
whistled Dan
Were in for a jolly afternoon
Shes deaf as a post and well have to split our throats to make her hear at all
Ive a notion to skin out
Oh dont talk like that Dan said Cecily reproachfully
Shes old and lonely and has had a great deal of trouble
She has buried three husbands
We must be kind to her and do the best we can to make her visit pleasant
Shes coming to the back door said Felicity with an agitated glance around the kitchen
I told you Dan that you should have shovelled the snow away from the front door this morning
Cecily set those pots in the pantry quickhide those boots Felixshut the cupboard door PeterSara straighten up the lounge
Shes awfully particular and ma says her house is always as neat as wax
To do Felicity justice while she issued orders to the rest of us she was flying busily about herself and it was amazing how much was accomplished in the way of putting the kitchen in perfect order during the two minutes in which Greataunt Eliza was crossing the yard
Fortunately the sittingroom is tidy and theres plenty in the pantry said Felicity who could face anything undauntedly with a wellstocked larder behind her
Further conversation was cut short by a decided rap at the door
Felicity opened it
Why how do you do Aunt Eliza
she said loudly
A slightly bewildered look appeared on Aunt Elizas face
Felicity perceived she had not spoken loudly enough
How do you do Aunt Eliza she repeated at the top of her voice
Come inwe are glad to see you
Weve been looking for you for ever so long
Are your father and mother at home
asked Aunt Eliza slowly
No they went to town today
But theyll be home this evening
Im sorry theyre away said Aunt Eliza coming in because I can stay only a few hours
Oh thats too bad shouted poor Felicity darting an angry glance at the rest of us as if to demand why we didnt help her out
Why weve been thinking youd stay a week with us anyway
You MUST stay over Sunday
I really cant
I have to go to Charlottetown tonight returned Aunt Eliza
Well youll take off your things and stay to tea at least urged Felicity as hospitably as her strained vocal chords would admit
Yes I think Ill do that
I want to get acquainted with mymy nephews and nieces said Aunt Eliza with a rather pleasant glance around our group
If I could have associated the thought of such a thing with my preconception of Greataunt Eliza I could have sworn there was a twinkle in her eye
But of course it was impossible
Wont you introduce yourselves please
Felicity shouted our names and Greataunt Eliza shook hands all round
She performed the duty grimly and I concluded I must have been mistaken about the twinkle
She was certainly very tall and dignified and imposingaltogether a greataunt to be respected
Felicity and Cecily took her to the spare room and then left her in the sittingroom while they returned to the kitchen to discuss the matter in family conclave
Well and what do you think of dear Aunt Eliza
asked Dan
Ssssh warned Cecily with a glance at the halfopen hall door
Pshaw scoffed Dan she cant hear us
There ought to be a law against anyone being as deaf as that
Shes not so oldlooking as I expected said Felix
If her hair wasnt so white she wouldnt look much older than your mother
You dont have to be very old to be a greataunt said Cecily
Kitty Marr has a greataunt who is just the same age as her mother
I expect it was burying so many husbands turned her hair white
But Aunt Eliza doesnt look just as I expected she would either
Shes dressed more stylishly than I expected said Felicity
I thought shed be real oldfashioned but her clothes arent too bad at all
She wouldnt be badlooking if twerent for her nose said Peter
Its too long and crooked besides
You neednt criticize our relations like that said Felicity tartly
Well arent you doing it yourselves
expostulated Peter
Thats different retorted Felicity
Never you mind Greataunt Elizas nose
Well dont expect me to talk to her said Dan cause I wont
Im going to be very polite to her said Felicity
Shes rich
But how are we to entertain her thats the question
What does the Family Guide say about entertaining your rich deaf old aunt
queried Dan ironically
The Family Guide says we should be polite to EVERYBODY said Cecily with a reproachful look at Dan
The worst of it is said Felicity looking worried that there isnt a bit of old bread in the house and she cant eat new Ive heard father say
It gives her indigestion
What will we do
Make a pan of rusks and apologize for having no old bread suggested the Story Girl probably by way of teasing Felicity
The latter however took it in all good faith
The Family Guide says we should never apologize for things we cant help
It says its adding insult to injury to do it
But you run over home for a loaf of stale bread Sara and its a good idea about the rusks
Ill make a panful
Let me make them said the Story Girl eagerly
I can make real good rusks now
No it wouldnt do to trust you said Felicity mercilessly
You might make some queer mistake and Aunt Eliza would tell it all over the country
Shes a fearful old gossip
Ill make the rusks myself
She hates cats so we mustnt let Paddy be seen
And shes a Methodist so mind nobody says anything against Methodists to her
Whos going to say anything anyhow
asked Peter belligerently
I wonder if I might ask her for her name for my quilt square
speculated Cecily
I believe I will
She looks so much friendlier than I expected
Of course shell choose the fivecent section
Shes an estimable old lady but very economical
Why dont you say shes so mean shed skin a flea for its hide and tallow
said Dan
Thats the plain truth
Well Im going to see about getting tea said Felicity so the rest of you will have to entertain her
You better go in and show her the photographs in the album
Dan you do it
Thank you thats a girls job said Dan
Id look nice sitting up to Aunt Eliza and yelling out that this was Uncle Jim and tother Cousin Sarahs twins wouldnt I
Cecily or the Story Girl can do it
I dont know all the pictures in your album said the Story Girl hastily
I spose Ill have to do it though I dont like to sighed Cecily
But we ought to go in
Weve left her alone too long now
Shell think we have no manners
Accordingly we all filed in rather reluctantly
Greataunt Eliza was toasting her toesclad as we noted in very smart and shapely shoesat the stove and looking quite at her ease
Cecily determined to do her duty even in the face of such fearful odds as Greataunt Elizas deafness dragged a ponderous plush covered album from its corner and proceeded to display and explain the family photographs
She did her brave best but she could not shout like Felicity and half the time as she confided to me later on she felt that Greataunt Eliza did not hear one word she said because she didnt seem to take in who the people were though just like all deaf folks she wouldnt let on
Greataunt Eliza certainly didnt talk much she looked at the photographs in silence but she smiled now and then
That smile bothered me
It was so twinkly and so very ungreatauntElizaish
But I felt indignant with her
I thought she might have shown a little more appreciation of Cecilys gallant efforts to entertain
It was very dull for the rest of us
The Story Girl sat rather sulkily in her corner she was angry because Felicity would not let her make the rusks and also perhaps a little vexed because she could not charm Greataunt Eliza with her golden voice and storytelling gift
Felix and I looked at each other and wished ourselves out in the hill field careering gloriously adown its gleaming crust
But presently a little amusement came our way
Dan who was sitting behind Greataunt Eliza and consequently out of her view began making comments on Cecilys explanation of this one and that one among the photographs
In vain Cecily implored him to stop
It was too good fun to give up
For the next halfhour the dialogue ran after this fashion while Peter and Felix and I and even the Story Girl suffered agonies trying to smother our bursts of laughterfor Greataunt Eliza could see if she couldnt hear CECILY SHOUTINGThat is Mr Joseph Elliott of Markdale a second cousin of mothers
DANDont brag of it Sis
Hes the man who was asked if somebody else said something in sincerity and old Joe said No he said it in my cellar
CECILYThis isnt anybody in our family
Its little Xavy Gautier who used to be hired with Uncle Roger
DANUncle Roger sent him to fix a gate one day and scolded him because he didnt do it right and Xavy was mad as hops and said How you spect me to fix dat gate
I never learned jogerfy
CECILY WITH AN ANGUISHED GLANCE AT DANThis is Greatuncle Robert King
DANHes been married four times
Dont you think thats often enough dear greataunty
CECILYDan
This is a nephew of Mr Ambrose Marrs
He lives out west and teaches school
DANYes and Uncle Roger says he doesnt know enough not to sleep in a field with the gate open
CECILYThis is Miss Julia Stanley who used to teach in Carlisle a few years ago
DANWhen she resigned the trustees had a meeting to see if theyd ask her to stay and raise her supplement
Old Highland Sandy was alive then and he got up and said If she for go let her for went
Perhaps she for marry
CECILY WITH THE AIR OF A MARTYRThis is Mr Layton who used to travel around selling Bibles and hymn books and Talmages sermons
DANHe was so thin Uncle Roger used to say he always mistook him for a crack in the atmosphere
One time he stayed here all night and went to prayer meeting and Mr Marwood asked him to lead in prayer
It had been raining most every day for three weeks and it was just in haymaking time and everybody thought the hay was going to be ruined and old Layton got up and prayed that God would send gentle showers on the growing crops and I heard Uncle Roger whisper to a fellow behind me If somebody dont choke him off we wont get the hay made this summer
CECILY IN EXASPERATIONDan shame on you for telling such irreverent stories
This is Mrs Alexander Scott of Markdale
She has been very sick for a long time
DANUncle Roger says all that keeps her alive is that shes scared her husband will marry again
CECILYThis is old Mr James MacPherson who used to live behind the graveyard
DANHes the man who told mother once that he always made his own iodine out of strong tea and baking soda
CECILYThis is Cousin Ebenezer MacPherson on the Markdale road
DANGreat temperance man
He never tasted rum in his life
He took the measles when he was fortyfive and was crazy as a loon with them and the doctor ordered them to give him a dose of brandy
When he swallowed it he looked up and says solemn as an owl Give it to me oftener and more at a time
CECILY IMPLORINGLYDan do stop
You make me so nervous I dont know what Im doing
This is Mr Lemuel Goodridge
He is a minister
DANYou ought to see his mouth
Uncle Roger says the drawing string has fell out of it
It just hangs looseso fashion
Dan whose own mouth was far from being beautiful here gave an imitation of the Rev
Lemuels to the utter undoing of Peter Felix and myself
Our wild guffaws of laughter penetrated even Greataunt Elizas deafness and she glanced up with a startled face
What we would have done I do not know had not Felicity at that moment appeared in the doorway with panicstricken eyes and exclaimed Cecily come here for a moment
Cecily glad of even a temporary respite fled to the kitchen and we heard her demanding what was the matter
Matter
exclaimed Felicity tragically
Matter enough
Some of you left a soup plate with molasses in it on the pantry table and Pat got into it and what do you think
He went into the spare room and walked all over Aunt Elizas things on the bed
You can see his tracks plain as plain
What in the world can we do
Shell be simply furious
I looked apprehensively at Greataunt Eliza but she was gazing intently at a picture of Aunt Janets sisters twins a most stolid uninteresting pair but evidently Greataunt Eliza found them amusing for she was smiling widely over them
Let us take a little clean water and a soft bit of cotton came Cecilys clear voice from the kitchen and see if we cant clean the molasses off
The coat and hat are both cloth and molasses isnt like grease
Well we can try but I wish the Story Girl would keep her cat home grumbled Felicity
The Story Girl here flew out to defend her pet and we four boys sat on miserably conscious of Greataunt Eliza who never said a word to us despite her previously expressed desire to become acquainted with us
She kept on looking at the photographs and seemed quite oblivious of our presence
Presently the girls returned having as transpired later been so successful in removing the traces of Paddys mischief that it was not deemed necessary to worry Greataunt Eliza with any account of it
Felicity announced tea and while Cecily conveyed Greataunt Eliza out to the diningroom lingered behind to consult with us for a moment
Ought we to ask her to say grace
she wanted to know
I know a story said the Story Girl about Uncle Roger when he was just a young man
He went to the house of a very deaf old lady and when they sat down to the table she asked him to say grace
Uncle Roger had never done such a thing in his life and he turned as red as a beet and looked down and muttered Err please excuse meIIm not accustomed to doing that
Then he looked up and the old lady said Amen loudly and cheerfully
She thought Uncle Roger was saying grace all the time
I dont think its right to tell funny stories about such things said Felicity coldly
And I asked for your opinion not for a story
If we dont ask her Felix must say it for hes the only one who can and we must have it or shed be shocked
Oh ask herask her advised Felix hastily
She was asked accordingly and said grace without any hesitation after which she proceeded to eat heartily of the excellent supper Felicity had provided
The rusks were especially good and Great aunt Eliza ate three of them and praised them
Apart from that she said little and during the first part of the meal we sat in embarrassed silence
Towards the last however our tongues were loosened and the Story Girl told us a tragic tale of old Charlottetown and a governors wife who had died of a broken heart in the early days of the colony
They say that story isnt true said Felicity
They say what she really died of was indigestion
The Governors wife who lives there now is a relation of our own
She is a second cousin of fathers but weve never seen her
Her name was Agnes Clark
And mind you when father was a young man he was dead in love with her and so was she with him
Who ever told you that
exclaimed Dan
Aunt Olivia
And Ive heard ma teasing father about it too
Of course it was before father got acquainted with mother
Why didnt your father marry her
I asked
Well she just simply wouldnt marry him in the end
She got over being in love with him
I guess she was pretty fickle
Aunt Olivia said father felt awful about it for awhile but he got over it when he met ma
Ma was twice as goodlooking as Agnes Clark
Agnes was a sight for freckles so Aunt Olivia says
But she and father remained real good friends
Just think if she had married him we would have been the children of the Governors wife
But she wouldnt have been the Governors wife then said Dan
I guess its just as good being fathers wife declared Cecily loyally
You might think so if you saw the Governor chuckled Dan
Uncle Roger says it would be no harm to worship him because he doesnt look like anything in the heavens above or on the earth beneath or the waters under the earth
Oh Uncle Roger just says that because hes on the opposite side of politics said Cecily
The Governor isnt really so very ugly
I saw him at the Markdale picnic two years ago
Hes very fat and bald and redfaced but Ive seen far worse looking men
Im afraid your seat is too near the stove Aunt Eliza shouted Felicity
Our guest whose face was certainly very much flushed shook her head
Oh no Im very comfortable she said
But her voice had the effect of making us uncomfortable
There was a queer uncertain little sound in it
Was Greataunt Eliza laughing at us
We looked at her sharply but her face was very solemn
Only her eyes had a suspicious appearance
Somehow we did not talk much more the rest of the meal
When it was over Greataunt Eliza said she was very sorry but she must really go
Felicity politely urged her to stay but was much relieved when Greataunt Eliza adhered to her intention of going
When Felicity took her to the spare room Cecily slipped upstairs and presently came back with a little parcel in her hand
What have you got there
demanded Felicity suspiciously
Aa little bag of roseleaves faltered Cecily
I thought Id give them to Aunt Eliza
The idea
Dont you do such a thing said Felicity contemptuously
Shed think you were crazy
She was awfully nice when I asked her for her name for the quilt protested Cecily and she took a tencent section after all
So Id like to give her the roseleavesand Im going to too Miss Felicity
Greataunt Eliza accepted the little gift quite graciously bade us all goodbye said she had enjoyed herself very much left messages for father and mother and finally betook herself away
We watched her cross the yard tall stately erect and disappear down the lane
Then as often aforetime we gathered together in the cheer of the red hearthflame while outside the wind of a winter twilight sang through fair white valleys brimmed with a reddening sunset and a faint serene silvercold star glimmered over the willow at the gate
Well said Felicity drawing a relieved breath Im glad shes gone
She certainly is queer just as mother said
Its a different kind of queerness from what I expected though said the Story Girl meditatively
Theres something I cant quite make out about Aunt Eliza
I dont think I altogether like her
Im precious sure I dont said Dan
Oh well never mind
Shes gone now and thats the last of it said Cecily comfortingly 
But it wasnt the last of itnot by any manner of means was it
When our grownups returned almost the first words Aunt Janet said were And so you had the Governors wife to tea
We all stared at her
I dont know what you mean said Felicity
We had nobody to tea except Greataunt Eliza
She came this afternoon and Greataunt Eliza
Nonsense said Aunt Janet
Aunt Eliza was in town today
She had tea with us at Aunt Louisas
But wasnt Mrs
Governor Lesley here
We met her on her way back to Charlottetown and she told us she was
She said she was visiting a friend in Carlisle and thought shed call to see father for old acquaintance sake
What in the world are all you children staring like that for
Your eyes are like saucers
There was a lady here to tea said Felicity miserably but we thought it was Greataunt Elizashe never SAID she wasntI thought she acted queerand we all yelled at her as if she was deafand said things to each other about her noseand Pat running over her clothes She must have heard all you said while I was showing her the photographs Dan cried Cecily
And about the Governor at tea time chuckled unrepentant Dan
I want to know what all this means said Aunt Janet sternly
She knew in due time after she had pieced the story together from our disjointed accounts
She was horrified and Uncle Alec was mildly disturbed but Uncle Roger roared with laughter and Aunt Olivia echoed it
To think you should have so little sense
said Aunt Janet in a disgusted tone
I think it was real mean of her to pretend she was deaf said Felicity almost on the verge of tears
That was Agnes Clark all over chuckled Uncle Roger
How she must have enjoyed this afternoon
She had enjoyed it as we learned the next day when a letter came from her
Dear Cecily and all the rest of you wrote the Governors wife I want to ask you to forgive me for pretending to be Aunt Eliza
I suspect it was a little horrid of me but really I couldnt resist the temptation and if you will forgive me for it I will forgive you for the things you said about the Governor and we will all be good friends
You know the Governor is a very nice man though he has the misfortune not to be handsome
I had just a splendid time at your place and I envy your Aunt Eliza her nephews and nieces
You were all so nice to me and I didnt dare to be a bit nice to you lest I should give myself away
But Ill make up for that when you come to see me at Government House as you all must the very next time you come to town
Im so sorry I didnt see Paddy for I love pussy cats even if they do track molasses over my clothes
And Cecily thank you ever so much for that little bag of potpourri
It smells like a hundred rose gardens and I have put it between the sheets for my very sparest room bed where you shall sleep when you come to see me you dear thing
And the Governor wants you to put his name on the quilt square too in the tencent section
Tell Dan I enjoyed his comments on the photographs very much
They were quite a refreshing contrast to the usual explanations of whos who
And Felicity your rusks were perfection
Do send me your recipe for them theres a darling
Yours most cordially AGNES CLARK LESLEY
Well it was decent of her to apologize anyhow commented Dan
If we only hadnt said that about the Governor moaned Felicity
How did you make your rusks
asked Aunt Janet
There was no bakingpowder in the house and I never could get them right with soda and cream of tartar
There was plenty of bakingpowder in the pantry said Felicity
No there wasnt a particle
I used the last making those cookies Thursday morning
But I found another can nearly full away back on the top shelf mathe one with the yellow label
I guess you forgot it was there
Aunt Janet stared at her pretty daughter blankly
Then amazement gave place to horror
Felicity King
she exclaimed
You dont mean to tell me that you raised those rusks with the stuff that was in that old yellow can
Yes I did faltered Felicity beginning to look scared
Why ma what was the matter with it
Matter
That stuff was TOOTHPOWDER thats what it was
Your Cousin Myra broke the bottle her toothpowder was in when she was here last winter and I gave her that old can to keep it in
She forgot to take it when she went away and I put it on that top shelf
I declare you must all have been bewitched yesterday
Poor poor Felicity
If she had not always been so horribly vain over her cooking and so scornfully contemptuous of other peoples aspirations and mistakes along that line I could have found it in my heart to pity her
The Story Girl would have been more than human if she had not betrayed a little triumphant amusement but Peter stood up for his lady manfully
The rusks were splendid anyhow so what difference does it make what they were raised with
Dan however began to taunt Felicity with her toothpowder rusks and kept it up for the rest of his natural life
Dont forget to send the Governors wife the recipe for them he said
Felicity with eyes tearful and cheeks crimson from mortification rushed from the room but never never did the Governors wife get the recipe for those rusks
CHAPTER VII WE VISIT COUSIN MATTIES One Saturday in March we walked over to Baywater for a long talkedof visit to Cousin Mattie Dilke
By the road Baywater was six miles away but there was a short cut across hills and fields and woods which was scantly three
We did not look forward to our visit with any particular delight for there was nobody at Cousin Matties except grownups who had been grown up so long that it was rather hard for them to remember they had ever been children
But as Felicity told us it was necessary to visit Cousin Mattie at least once a year or else she would be huffed so we concluded we might as well go and have it over
Anyhow well get a splendiferous dinner said Dan
Cousin Matties a great cook and theres nothing stingy about her
You are always thinking of your stomach said Felicity pleasantly
Well you know I couldnt get along very well without it darling responded Dan who since New Years had adopted a new method of dealing with Felicitywhether by way of keeping his resolution or because he had discovered that it annoyed Felicity far more than angry retorts deponent sayeth not
He invariably met her criticisms with a goodnatured grin and a flippant remark with some tender epithet tagged on to it
Poor Felicity used to get hopelessly furious over it
Uncle Alec was dubious about our going that day
He looked abroad on the general dourness of gray earth and gray air and gray sky and said a storm was brewing
But Cousin Mattie had been sent word that we were coming and she did not like to be disappointed so he let us go warning us to stay with Cousin Mattie all night if the storm came on while we were there
We enjoyed our walkeven Felix enjoyed it although he had been appointed to write up the visit for Our Magazine and was rather weighed down by the responsibility of it
What mattered it though the world were gray and wintry
We walked the golden road and carried spring time in our hearts and we beguiled our way with laughter and jest and the tales the Story Girl told usmyths and legends of elder time
The walking was good for there had lately been a thaw and everything was frozen
We went over fields crossed by spidery trails of gray fences where the withered grasses stuck forlornly up through the snow we lingered for a time in a group of hill pines great majestic treecreatures friends of evening stars and finally struck into the belt of fir and maple which intervened between Carlisle and Baywater
It was in this locality that Peg Bowen lived and our way lay near her house though not directly in sight of it
We hoped we would not meet her for since the affair of the bewitchment of Paddy we did not know quite what to think of Peg the boldest of us held his breath as we passed her haunts and drew it again with a sigh of relief when they were safely left behind
The woods were full of the brooding stillness that often precedes a storm and the wind crept along their white conesprinkled floors with a low wailing cry
Around us were solitudes of snow arcades picked out in pearl and silver long avenues of untrodden marble whence sprang the cathedral columns of the firs
We were all sorry when we were through the woods and found ourselves looking down into the snug commonplace farmsteaddotted settlement of Baywater
Theres Cousin Matties housethat big white one at the turn of the road said the Story Girl
I hope she has that dinner ready Dan
Im hungry as a wolf after our walk
I wish Cousin Matties husband was still alive said Dan
He was an awful nice old man
He always had his pockets full of nuts and apples
I used to like going there better when he was alive
Too many old women dont suit me
Oh Dan Cousin Mattie and her sistersinlaw are just as nice and kind as they can be reproached Cecily
Oh theyre kind enough but they never seem to see that a fellow gets over being five years old if he only lives long enough retorted Dan
I know a story about Cousin Matties husband said the Story Girl
His name was Ebenezer you know Is it any wonder he was thin and stunted looking
said Dan
Ebenezer is just as nice a name as Daniel said Felicity
Do you REALLY think so my angel
inquired Dan in honeysweet tones
Go on
Remember your second resolution I whispered to the Story Girl who was stalking along with an outraged expression
The Story Girl swallowed something and went on
Cousin Ebenezer had a horror of borrowing
He thought it was simply a dreadful disgrace to borrow ANYTHING
Well you know he and Cousin Mattie used to live in Carlisle where the Rays now live
This was when Grandfather King was alive
One day Cousin Ebenezer came up the hill and into the kitchen where all the family were
Uncle Roger said he looked as if he had been stealing sheep
He sat for a whole hour in the kitchen and hardly spoke a word but just looked miserable
At last he got up and said in a desperate sort of way Uncle Abraham can I speak with you in private for a minute
Oh certainly said grandfather and took him into the parlour
Cousin Ebenezer shut the door looked all around him and then said imploringly MORE PRIVATE STILL
So grandfather took him into the spare room and shut that door
He was getting frightened
He thought something terrible must have happened Cousin Ebenezer
Cousin Ebenezer came right up to grandfather took hold of the lapel of his coat and said in a whisper Uncle Abraham CANYOULENDMEANAXE
He neednt have made such a mystery about it said Cecily who had missed the point entirely and couldnt see why the rest of us were laughing
But Cecily was such a darling that we did not mind her lack of a sense of humour
Its kind of mean to tell stories like that about people who are dead said Felicity
Sometimes its safer than when theyre alive though sweetheart commented Dan
We had our expected good dinner at Cousin Mattiesmay it be counted unto her for righteousness
She and her sistersinlaw Miss Louisa Jane and Miss Caroline were very kind to us
We had quite a nice time although I understood why Dan objected to them when they patted us all on the head and told us whom we resembled and gave us peppermint lozenges
CHAPTER VIII WE VISIT PEG BOWEN We left Cousin Matties early for it still looked like a storm though no more so than it had in the morning
We intended to go home by a different pathone leading through cleared land overgrown with scrub maple which had the advantage of being farther away from Peg Bowens house
We hoped to be home before it began to storm but we had hardly reached the hill above the village when a fine driving snow began to fall
It would have been wiser to have turned back even then but we had already come a mile and we thought we would have ample time to reach home before it became really bad
We were sadly mistaken by the time we had gone another halfmile we were in the thick of a bewildering blinding snowstorm
But it was by now just as far back to Cousin Matties as it was to Uncle Alecs so we struggled on growing more frightened at every step
We could hardly face the stinging snow and we could not see ten feet ahead of us
It had turned bitterly cold and the tempest howled all around us in white desolation under the fastdarkening night
The narrow path we were trying to follow soon became entirely obliterated and we stumbled blindly on holding to each other and trying to peer through the furious whirl that filled the air
Our plight had come upon us so suddenly that we could not realize it
Presently Peter who was leading the van because he was supposed to know the path best stopped
I cant see the road any longer he shouted
I dont know where we are
We all stopped and huddled together in a miserable group
Fear filled our hearts
It seemed ages ago that we had been snug and safe and warm at Cousin Matties
Cecily began to cry with cold
Dan in spite of her protests dragged off his overcoat and made her put it on
We cant stay here he said
Well all freeze to death if we do
Come onweve got to keep moving
The snow aint so deep yet
Take hold of my hand Cecily
We must all hold together
Come now
It wont be nice to be frozen to death but if we get through alive think what a story well have to tell said the Story Girl between her chattering teeth
In my heart I did not believe we would ever get through alive
It was almost pitch dark now and the snow grew deeper every moment
We were chilled to the heart
I thought how nice it would be to lie down and rest but I remembered hearing that that was fatal and I endeavoured to stumble on with the others
It was wonderful how the girls kept up even Cecily
It occurred to me to be thankful that Sara Ray was not with us
But we were wholly lost now
All around us was a horror of great darkness
Suddenly Felicity fell
We dragged her up but she declared she could not go onshe was done out
Have you any idea where we are
shouted Dan to Peter
No Peter shouted back the wind is blowing every which way
I havent any idea where home is
Home
Would we ever see it again
We tried to urge Felicity on but she only repeated drowsily that she must lie down and rest
Cecily too was reeling against me
The Story Girl still stood up staunchly and counselled struggling on but she was numb with cold and her words were hardly distinguishable
Some wild idea was in my mind that we must dig a hole in the snow and all creep into it
I had read somewhere that people had thus saved their lives in snowstorms
Suddenly Felix gave a shout
I see a light he cried
Where
Where
We all looked but could see nothing
I dont see it now but I saw it a moment ago shouted Felix
Im sure I did
Come onover in this direction
Inspired with fresh hope we hurried after him
Soon we all saw the lightand never shone a fairer beacon
A few more steps and coming into the shelter of the woodland on the further side we realized where we were
Thats Peg Bowens house exclaimed Peter stopping short in dismay
I dont care whose house it is declared Dan
Weve got to go to it
I spose so acquiesced Peter ruefully
We cant freeze to death even if she is a witch
For goodness sake dont say anything about witches so close to her house gasped Felicity
Ill be thankful to get in anywhere
We reached the house climbed the flight of steps that led to that mysterious second story door and Dan rapped
The door opened promptly and Peg Bowen stood before us in what seemed exactly the same costume she had worn on the memorable day when we had come bearing gifts to propitiate her in the matter of Paddy
Behind her was a dim room scantly illumined by the one small candle that had guided us through the storm but the old Waterloo stove was colouring the gloom with tremulous rosered whorls of light and warm and cosy indeed seemed Pegs retreat to us snow covered frostchilled benighted wanderers
Gracious goodness where did yez all come from
exclaimed Peg
Did they turn yez out
Weve been over to Baywater and we got lost in the storm coming back explained Dan
We didnt know where we were till we saw your light
I guess well have to stay here till the storm is overif you dont mind
And if it wont inconvenience you said Cecily timidly
Oh its no inconvenience to speak of
Come in
Well yez HAVE got some snow on yez
Let me get a broom
You boys stomp your feet well and shake your coats
You girls give me your things and Ill hang them up
Guess yez are most froze
Well sit up to the stove and git het up
Peg bustled away to gather up a dubious assortment of chairs with backs and rungs missing and in a few minutes we were in a circle around her roaring stove getting dried and thawed out
In our wildest flights of fancy we had never pictured ourselves as guests at the witchs hearthstone
Yet here we were and the witch herself was actually brewing a jorum of ginger tea for Cecily who continued to shiver long after the rest of us were roasted to the marrow
Poor Sis drank that scalding draught being in too great awe of Peg to do aught else
Thatll soon fix your shivers said our hostess kindly
And now Ill get yez all some tea
Oh please dont trouble said the Story Girl hastily
Taint any trouble said Peg briskly then with one of the sudden changes to fierceness which made her such a terrifying personage Do yez think my vittels aint clean
Oh no no cried Felicity quickly before the Story Girl could speak none of us would ever think THAT
Sara only meant she didnt want you to go to any bother on our account
It aint any bother said Peg mollified
Im spry as a cricket this winter though I have the realagy sometimes
Many a good bite Ive had in your mas kitchen
I owe yez a meal
No more protests were made
We sat in awed silence gazing with timid curiosity about the room the stained plastered walls of which were wellnigh covered with a motley assortment of pictures chromos and advertisements pasted on without much regard for order or character
We had heard much of Pegs pets and now we saw them
Six cats occupied various cosy corners one of them the black goblin which had so terrified us in the summer blinked satirically at us from the centre of Pegs bed
Another a dilapidated striped beastie with both ears and one eye gone glared at us from the sofa in the corner
A dog with only three legs lay behind the stove a crow sat on a roost above our heads in company with a matronly old hen and on the clock shelf were a stuffed monkey and a grinning skull
We had heard that a sailor had given Peg the monkey
But where had she got the skull
And whose was it
I could not help puzzling over these gruesome questions
Presently tea was ready and we gathered around the festal boarda board literally as well as figuratively for Pegs table was the work of her own unskilled hands
The less said about the viands of that meal and the dishes they were served in the better
But we ate thembless you yesas we would have eaten any witchs banquet set before us
Peg might or might not be a witchcommon sense said not but we knew she was quite capable of turning every one of us out of doors in one of her sudden fierce fits if we offended her and we had no mind to trust ourselves again to that wild forest where we had fought a losing fight with the demon forces of night and storm
But it was not an agreeable meal in more ways than one
Peg was not at all careful of anybodys feelings
She hurt Felixs cruelly as she passed him his cup of tea
Youve gone too much to flesh boy
So the magic seed didnt work hey
How in the world had Peg found out about that magic seed
Felix looked uncommonly foolish
If youd come to me in the first place Id soon have told you how to get thin said Peg nodding wisely
Wont you tell me now
asked Felix eagerly his desire to melt his too solid flesh overcoming his dread and shame
No I dont like being second fiddle answered Peg with a crafty smile
Sara youre too scrawny and palenot much like your ma
I knew her well
She was counted a beauty but she made no great things of a match
Your father had some money but he was a tramp like meself
Where is he now
In Rome said the Story Girl rather shortly
People thought your ma was crazy when she took him
But shed a right to please herself
Folks is too ready to call other folks crazy
Theres people who say IM not in my right mind
Did yez everPeg fixed Felicity with a piercing glancehear anything so ridiculous
Never said Felicity white to the lips
I wish everybody was as sane as I am said Peg scornfully
Then she looked poor Felicity over critically
Youre goodlooking but proud
And your complexion wont wear
Itll be like your mas yettoo much red in it
Well thats better than being the colour of mud muttered Peter who wasnt going to hear his lady traduced even by a witch
All the thanks he got was a furious look from Felicity but Peg had not heard him and now she turned her attention to Cecily
You look delicate
I daresay youll never live to grow up
Cecilys lip trembled and Dans face turned crimson
Shut up he said to Peg
Youve no business to say such things to people
I think my jaw dropped
I know Peters and Felixs did
Felicity broke in wildly
Oh dont mind him Miss Bowen
Hes got SUCH a temperthats just the way he talks to us all at home
PLEASE excuse him
Bless you I dont mind him said Peg from whom the unexpected seemed to be the thing to expect
I like a lad of spurrit
And so your father run away did he Peter
He used to be a beau of minehe seen me home three times from singing school when we was young
Some folks said he did it for a dare
Theres such a lot of jealousy in the world aint there
Do you know where he is now
No said Peter
Well hes coming home before long said Peg mysteriously
Who told you that
cried Peter in amazement
Better not ask responded Peg looking up at the skull
If she meant to make the flesh creep on our bones she succeeded
But now much to our relief the meal was over and Peg invited us to draw our chairs up to the stove again
Make yourselves at home she said producing her pipe from her pocket
I aint one of the kind who thinks their houses too good to live in
Guess I wont bother washing the dishes
Theyll do yez for breakfast if yez dont forget your places
I spose none of yez smokes
No said Felicity rather primly
Then yez dont know whats good for yez retorted Peg rather grumpily
But a few whiffs of her pipe placated her and observing Cecily sigh she asked her kindly what was the matter
Im thinking how worried theyll be at home about us explained Cecily
Bless you dearie dont be worrying over that
Ill send them word that yez are all snug and safe here
But how can you
cried amazed Cecily
Better not ask said Peg again with another glance at the skull
An uncomfortable silence followed finally broken by Peg who introduced her pets to us and told how she had come by them
The black cat was her favourite
That cat knows more than I do if yezll believe it she said proudly
Ive got a rat too but hes a bit shy when strangers is round
Your cat got all right again that time didnt he
Yes said the Story Girl
Thought he would said Peg nodding sagely
I seen to that
Now dont yez all be staring at the hole in my dress
We werent was our chorus of protest
Looked as if yez were
I tore that yesterday but I didnt mend it
I was brought up to believe that a hole was an accident but a patch was a disgrace
And so your Aunt Olivia is going to be married after all
This was news to us
We felt and looked dazed
I never heard anything of it said the Story Girl
Oh its true enough
Shes a great fool
Ive no faith in husbands
But one good thing is she aint going to marry that Henry Jacobs of Markdale
He wants her bad enough
Just like his presumptionthinking himself good enough for a King
His father is the worst man alive
He chased me off his place with his dog once
But Ill get even with him yet
Peg looked very savage and visions of burned barns floated through our minds
Hell be punished in hell you know said Peter timidly
But I wont be there to see that rejoined Peg
Some folks say Ill go there because I dont go to church oftener
But I dont believe it
Why dont you go
asked Peter with a temerity that bordered on rashness
Well Ive got so sunburned Im afraid folks might take me for an Injun explained Peg quite seriously
Besides your minister makes such awful long prayers
Why does he do it
I suppose he finds it easier to talk to God than to people suggested Peter reflectively
Well anyway I belong to the round church said Peg comfortably and so the devil cant catch ME at the corners
I havent been to Carlisle church for over three years
I thought Id adied laughing the last time I was there
Old Elder Marr took up the collection that day
Hed on a pair of new boots and they squeaked all the way up and down the aisles
And every time the boots squeaked the elder made a face like he had toothache
It was awful funny
Hows your missionary quilt coming on Cecily
Was there anything Peg didnt know
Very well said Cecily
You can put my name on it if you want to
Oh thank you
Which sectionthe fivecent one or the tencent one
asked Cecily timidly
The tencent one of course
The best is none too good for me
Ill give you the ten cents another time
Im short of change just nownot being as rich as Queen Victory
Theres her picture up therethe one with the blue sash and diamint crown and the lace curting on her head
Can any of yez tell me thisis Queen Victory a married woman
Oh yes but her husband is dead answered the Story Girl
Well I spose they couldnt have called her an old maid seeing she was a queen even if shed never got married
Sometimes I sez to myself Peg would you like to be Queen Victory
But I never know what to answer
In summer when I can roam anywhere in the woods and the sunshineI wouldnt be Queen Victory for anything
But when its winter and cold and I cant git nowheresI feel as if I wouldnt mind changing places with her
Peg put her pipe back in her mouth and began to smoke fiercely
The candle wick burned long and was topped by a little cap of fiery red that seemed to wink at us like an impish gnome
The most grotesque shadow of Peg flickered over the wall behind her
The oneeyed cat remitted his grim watch and went to sleep
Outside the wind screamed like a ravening beast at the window
Suddenly Peg removed her pipe from her mouth bent forward gripped my wrist with her sinewy fingers until I almost cried out with pain and gazed straight into my face
I felt horribly frightened of her
She seemed an entirely different creature
A wild light was in her eyes a furtive animallike expression was on her face
When she spoke it was in a different voice and in different language
Do you hear the wind
she asked in a thrilling whisper
What IS the wind
What IS the wind
IIdont know I stammered
No more do I said Peg and nobody knows
Nobody knows what the wind is
I wish I could find out
I mightnt be so afraid of the wind if I knew what it was
I am afraid of it
When the blasts come like that I want to crouch down and hide me
But I can tell you one thing about the windits the only free thing in the worldTHEONLYFREETHING
Everything else is subject to some law but the wind is FREE
It bloweth where it listeth and no man can tame it
Its freethats why I love it though Im afraid of it
Its a grand thing to be freefree freefree
Pegs voice rose almost to a shriek
We were dreadfully frightened for we knew there were times when she was quite crazy and we feared one of her spells was coming on her
But with a swift movement she turned the mans coat she wore up over her shoulders and head like a hood completely hiding her face
Then she crouched forward elbows on knees and relapsed into silence
None of us dared speak or move
We sat thus for half an hour
Then Peg jumped up and said briskly in her usual tone Well I guess yez are all sleepy and ready for bed
You girls can sleep in my bed over there and Ill take the sofy
Yez can put the cat off if yez like though he wont hurt yez
You boys can go downstairs
Theres a big pile of straw there thatll do yez for a bed if yez put your coats on
Ill light yez down but I aint going to leave yez a light for fear yezd set fire to the place
Saying goodnight to the girls who looked as if they thought their last hour was come we went to the lower room
It was quite empty save for a pile of fire wood and another of clean straw
Casting a stealthy glance around ere Peg withdrew the light I was relieved to see that there were no skulls in sight
We four boys snuggled down in the straw
We did not expect to sleep but we were very tired and before we knew it our eyes were shut to open no more till morning
The poor girls were not so fortunate
They always averred they never closed an eye
Four things prevented them from sleeping
In the first place Peg snored loudly in the second place the fitful gleams of firelight kept flickering over the skull for half the night and making gruesome effects on it in the third place Pegs pillows and bedclothes smelled rankly of tobacco smoke and in the fourth place they were afraid the rat Peg had spoken of might come out to make their acquaintance
Indeed they were sure they heard him skirmishing about several times
When we wakened in the morning the storm was over and a young morning was looking through rosy eyelids across a white world
The little clearing around Pegs cabin was heaped with dazzling drifts and we boys fell to and shovelled out a road to her well
She gave us breakfaststiff oatmeal porridge without milk and a boiled egg apiece
Cecily could NOT eat her porridge she declared she had such a bad cold that she had no appetite a cold she certainly had the rest of us choked our messes down and after we had done so Peg asked us if we had noticed a soapy taste
The soap fell into the porridge while I was making it she said
Butsmacking her lipsIm going to make yez an Irish stew for dinner
Itll be fine
An Irish stew concocted by Peg
No wonder Dan said hastily You are very kind but well have to go right home
Yez cant walk said Peg
Oh yes we can
The drifts are so hard theyll carry and the snow will be pretty well blown off the middle of the fields
Its only threequarters of a mile
We boys will go home and get a pung and come back for you girls
But the girls wouldnt listen to this
They must go with us even Cecily
Seems to me yez werent in such a hurry to leave last night observed Peg sarcastically
Oh its only because theyll be so anxious about us at home and its Sunday and we dont want to miss Sunday School explained Felicity
Well I hope your Sunday School will do yez good said Peg rather grumpily
But she relented again at the last and gave Cecily a wishbone
Whatever you wish on that will come true she said
But you only have the one wish so dont waste it
Were so much obliged to you for all your trouble said the Story Girl politely
Never mind the trouble
The expense is the thing retorted Peg grimly
Oh
Felicity hesitated
If you would let us pay yougive you something No thank yez responded Peg loftily
There is people who take money for their hospitality Ive heerd but Im thankful to say I dont associate with that class
Yez are welcome to all yez have had here if yez ARE in a big hurry to get away
She shut the door behind us with something of a slam and her black cat followed us so far with stealthy furtive footsteps that we were frightened of it
Eventually it turned back then and not till then did we feel free to discuss our adventure
Well Im thankful were out of THAT said Felicity drawing a long breath
Hasnt it just been an awful experience
We might all have been found frozen stark and stiff this morning remarked the Story Girl with apparent relish
I tell you it was a lucky thing we got to Peg Bowens said Dan
Miss Marwood says there is no such thing as luck protested Cecily
We ought to say it was Providence instead
Well Peg and Providence dont seem to go together very well somehow retorted Dan
If Peg is a witch it must be the Other One shes in co
with
Dan its getting to be simply scandalous the way you talk said Felicity
I just wish ma could hear you
Is soap in porridge any worse than toothpowder in rusks lovely creature
asked Dan
Dan Dan admonished Cecily between her coughs remember its Sunday
It seems hard to remember that said Peter
It doesnt seem a mite like Sunday and it seems awful long since yesterday
Cecily youve got a dreadful cold said the Story Girl anxiously
In spite of Pegs ginger tea added Felix
Oh that ginger tea was AWFUL exclaimed poor Cecily
I thought Id never get it downit was so hot with gingerand there was so much of it
But I was so frightened of offending Peg Id have tried to drink it all if there had been a bucketful
Oh yes its very easy for you all to laugh
You didnt have to drink it
We had to eat two meals though said Felicity with a shiver
And I dont know when those dishes of hers were washed
I just shut my eyes and took gulps
Did you notice the soapy taste in the porridge
asked the Story Girl
Oh there were so many queer tastes about it I didnt notice one more than another answered Felicity wearily
What bothers me remarked Peter absently is that skull
Do you suppose Peg really finds things out by it
Nonsense
How could she
scoffed Felix bold as a lion in daylight
She didnt SAY she did you know I said cautiously
Well well know in time if the things she said were going to happen do mused Peter
Do you suppose your father is really coming home
queried Felicity
I hope not answered Peter decidedly
You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Felicity severely
No I oughtnt
Father got drunk all the time he was home and wouldnt work and was bad to mother said Peter defiantly
She had to support him as well as herself and me
I dont want to see any father coming home and youd better believe it
Of course if he was the right sort of a father itd be different
What I would like to know is if Aunt Olivia is going to be married said the Story Girl absently
I can hardly believe it
But now that I think of itUncle Roger has been teasing her ever since she was in Halifax last summer
If she does get married youll have to come and live with us said Cecily delightedly
Felicity did not betray so much delight and the Story Girl remarked with a weary little sigh that she hoped Aunt Olivia wouldnt
We all felt rather weary somehow
Pegs predictions had been unsettling and our nerves had all been more or less strained during our sojourn under her roof
We were glad when we found ourselves at home
The folks had not been at all troubled about us but it was because they were sure the storm had come up before we would think of leaving Cousin Matties and not because they had received any mysterious message from Pegs skull
We were relieved at this but on the whole our adventure had not done much towards clearing up the vexed question of Pegs witchcraft
CHAPTER IX EXTRACTS FROM THE FEBRUARY AND MARCH NUMBERS OF Our Magazine RESOLUTION HONOUR ROLL Miss Felicity King
HONOURABLE MENTION Mr Felix King
Mr Peter Craig
Miss Sara Ray
EDITORIAL The editor wishes to make a few remarks about the Resolution Honour Roll
As will be seen only one name figures on it
Felicity says she has thought a beautiful thought every morning before breakfast without missing one morning not even the one we were at Peg Bowens
Some of our number think it not fair that Felicity should be on the honour roll FELICITY ASIDE Thats Dan of course
when she only made one resolution and wont tell us what any of the thoughts were
So we have decided to give honourable mention to everybody who has kept one resolution perfect
Felix has worked all his arithmetic problems by himself
He complains that he never got more than a third of them right and the teacher has marked him away down but one cannot keep resolutions without some inconvenience
Peter has never played tittatx in church or got drunk and says it wasnt as bad as he expected
PETER INDIGNANTLY I never said it
CECILY SOOTHINGLY Now Peter Bev only meant that as a joke
Sara Ray has never talked any mean gossip but does not find conversation as interesting as it used to be
SARA RAY WONDERINGLY I dont remember of saying that
Felix did not eat any apples until March but forgot and ate seven the day we were at Cousin Matties
FELIX I only ate five
He soon gave up trying to say what he thought always
He got into too much trouble
We think Felix ought to change to old Grandfather Kings rule
It was Hold your tongue when you can and when you cant tell the truth
Cecily feels she has not read all the good books she might because some she tried to read were very dull and the Pansy books were so much more interesting
And it is no use trying not to feel bad because her hair isnt curly and she has marked that resolution out
The Story Girl came very near to keeping her resolution to have all the good times possible but she says she missed two if not three she might have had
Dan refuses to say anything about his resolutions and so does the editor
PERSONALS We regret that Miss Cecily King is suffering from a severe cold
Mr Alexander Marr of Markdale died very suddenly last week
We never heard of his death till he was dead
Miss Cecily King wishes to state that she did not ask the question about Holy Moses and the other word in the January number
Dan put it in for a mean joke
The weather has been cold and fine
We have only had one bad storm
The coasting on Uncle Rogers hill continues good
Aunt Eliza did not favour us with a visit after all
She took cold and had to go home
We were sorry that she had a cold but glad that she had to go home
Cecily said she thought it wicked of us to be glad
But when we asked her cross her heart if she wasnt glad herself she had to say she was
Miss Cecily King has got three very distinguished names on her quilt square
They are the Governor and his wife and a witchs
The King family had the honour of entertaining the Governors wife to tea on February the seventeenth
We are all invited to visit Government House but some of us think we wont go
A tragic event occurred last Tuesday
Mrs James Frewen came to tea and there was no pie in the house
Felicity has not yet fully recovered
A new boy is coming to school
His name is Cyrus Brisk and his folks moved up from Markdale
He says he is going to punch Willy Frasers head if Willy keeps on thinking he is Miss Cecily Kings beau
CECILY I havent ANY beau
I dont mean to think of such a thing for at least eight years yet
Miss Alice Reade of Charlottetown Royalty has come to Carlisle to teach music
She boards at Mr Peter Armstrongs
The girls are all going to take music lessons from her
Two descriptions of her will be found in another column
Felix wrote one but the girls thought he did not do her justice so Cecily wrote another one
She admits she copied most of the description out of Valeria H Montagues story Lord Marmadukes First Last and Only Love or the Bride of the Castle by the Sea but says they fit Miss Reade better than anything she could make up
HOUSEHOLD DEPARTMENT Always keep the kitchen tidy and then you neednt mind if company comes unexpectedly
ANXIOUS INQUIRER We dont know anything that will take the stain out of a silk dress when a softboiled egg is dropped on it
Better not wear your silk dress so often especially when boiling eggs
Ginger tea is good for colds
OLD HOUSEKEEPER Yes when the bakingpowder gives out you can use toothpowder instead
FELICITY I never wrote that
I dont care I dont think its fair for other people to be putting things in my department
Our apples are not keeping well this year
They are rotting and besides father says we eat an awful lot of them
PERSEVERANCE I will give you the recipe for dumplings you ask for
But remember it is not everyone who can make dumplings even from the recipe
Theres a knack in it
If the soap falls into the porridge do not tell your guests about it until they have finished eating it because it might take away their appetite
FELICITY KING
ETIQUETTE DEPARTMENT Pr CgDo not criticize peoples noses unless you are sure they cant hear you and dont criticize your best girls greataunts nose in any case
FELICITY TOSSING HER HEAD Oh my
I spose Dan thought that was extra smart
Cy KgWhen my most intimate friend walks with another girl and exchanges lace patterns with her what ought I to do
Ans
Adopt a dignified attitude
Fy KgIt is better not to wear your second best hat to church but if your mother says you must it is not for me to question her decision
FELICITY Dan just copied that word for word out of the Family Guide except about the hat part
Pr CgYes it would be quite proper to say good evening to the family ghost if you met it
Fx KgNo it is not polite to sleep with your mouth open
Whats more it isnt safe
Something might fall into it
DAN KING
FASHION NOTES Crocheted watch pockets are all the rage now
If you havent a watch they do to carry your pencil in or a piece of gum
It is stylish to have hair ribbons to match your dress
But it is hard to match gray drugget
I like scarlet for that
It is stylish to pin a piece of ribbon on your coat the same colour as your chum wears in her hair
Mary Martha Cowan saw them doing it in town and started us doing it here
I always wear Kittys ribbon and Kitty wears mine but the Story Girl thinks it is silly
CECILY KING
AN ACCOUNT OF OUR VISIT TO COUSIN MATTIES We all walked over to Cousin Matties last week
They were all well there and we had a fine dinner
On our way back a snowstorm came up and we got lost in the woods
We didnt know where we were or nothing
If we hadnt seen a light I guess wed all have been frozen and snowed over and they would never have found us till spring and that would be very sad
But we saw a light and made for it and it was Peg Bowens
Some people think she is a witch and its hard to tell but she was real hospitable and took us all in
Her house was very untidy but it was warm
She has a skull
I mean a loose skull not her own
She lets on it tells her things but Uncle Alec says it couldnt because it was only an Indian skull that old Dr Beecham had and Peg stole it when he died but Uncle Roger says he wouldnt trust himself with Pegs skull for anything
She gave us supper
It was a horrid meal
The Story Girl says I must not tell what I found in the bread and butter because it would be too disgusting to read in Our Magazine but it dont matter because we were all there except Sara Ray and know what it was
We stayed all night and us boys slept in straw
None of us had ever slept on straw before
We got home in the morning
That is all I can write about our visit to Cousin Matties
FELIX KING
MY WORST ADVENTURE Its my turn to write it so I suppose I must
I guess my worst adventure was two years ago when a whole lot of us were coasting on Uncle Rogers hill
Charlie Cowan and Fred Marr had started but halfway down their sled got stuck and I run down to shove them off again
Then I stood there just a moment to watch them with my back to the top of the hill
While I was standing there Rob Marr started Kitty and Em Frewen off on his sled
His sled had a wooden tongue in it and it slanted back over the girls heads
I was right in the way and they yelled to me to get out but just as I heard them it struck me
The sled took me between the legs and I was histed back over the tongue and dropped in a heap behind before I knew what had happened to me
I thought a tornado had struck me
The girls couldnt stop though they thought I was killed but Rob came tearing down and helped me up
He was awful scared but I wasnt killed nor my back wasnt broken but my nose bled something awful and kept on bleeding for three days
Not all the time but by spells
DAN KING
THE STORY OF HOW CARLISLE GOT ITS NAME This is a true story to
Long ago there was a girl lived in charlotte town
I dont know her name so I cant right it and maybe it is just as well for Felicity might think it wasnt romantik like Miss Jemima Parrs
She was awful pretty and a young englishman who had come out to make his fortune fell in love with her and they were engaged to be married the next spring
His name was Mr Carlisle
In the winter he started off to hunt cariboo for a spell
Cariboos lived on the island then
There aint any here now
He got to where it is Carlisle now
It wasnt anything then only woods and a few indians
He got awful sick and was sick for ever so long in a indian camp and only an old micmac squaw to wait on him
Back in town they all thought he was dead and his girl felt bad for a little while and then got over it and took up with another beau
The girls say that wasnt romantik but I think it was sensible but if it had been me that died Id have felt bad if she forgot me so soon
But he hadnt died and when he got back to town he went right to her house and walked in and there she was standing up to be married to the other fellow
Poor Mr Carlisle felt awful
He was sick and week and it went to his head
He just turned and run and run till he got back to the old micmacs camp and fell in front of it
But the indians had gone because it was spring and it didnt matter because he really was dead this time and people come looking for him from town and found him and buryed him there and called the place after him
They say the girl was never happy again and that was hard lines on her but maybe she deserved it
PETER CRAIG
MISS ALICE READE Miss Alice Reade is a very pretty girl
She has kind of curly blackish hair and big gray eyes and a pale face
She is tall and thin but her figure is pretty fair and she has a nice mouth and a sweet way of speaking
The girls are crazy about her and talk about her all the time
FELIX KING
BEAUTIFUL ALICE That is what we girls call Miss Reade among ourselves
She is divinely beautiful
Her magnificent wealth of raven hair flows back in glistening waves from her sunkissed brow
DAN If Felix had said she was sunburned youd have all jumped on him
CECILY COLDLY Sunkissed doesnt mean sunburned
DAN What does it mean then
CECILY EMBARRASSED II dont know
But Miss Montague says the Lady Geraldines brow was sunkissed and of course an earls daughter wouldnt be sunburned
THE STORY GIRL Oh dont interrupt the reading like this
It spoils it
Her eyes are gloriously dark and deep like midnight lakes mirroring the stars of heaven
Her features are like sculptured marble and her mouth is a trembling curving Cupids bow
PETER ASIDE What kind of a thing is that
Her creamy skin is as fair and flawless as the petals of a white lily
Her voice is like the ripple of a woodland brook and her slender form is matchless in its symmetry
DAN Thats Valerias way of putting it but Uncle Roger says she dont show her feed much
FELICITY Dan
if Uncle Roger is vulgar you neednt be
Her hands are like a poets dreams
She dresses so nicely and looks so stylish in her clothes
Her favourite colour is blue
Some people think she is stiff and some say she is stuckup but she isnt a bit
Its just that she is different from them and they dont like it
She is just lovely and we adore her
CECILY KING
CHAPTER X DISAPPEARANCE OF PADDY As I remember the spring came late that year in Carlisle
It was May before the weather began to satisfy the grownups
But we children were more easily pleased and we thought April a splendid month because the snow all went early and left gray firm frozen ground for our rambles and games
As the days slipped by they grew more gracious the hillsides began to look as if they were thinking of mayflowers the old orchard was washed in a bath of tingling sunshine and the sap stirred in the big trees by day the sky was veiled with delicate cloud drift fine and filmy as woven mist in the evenings a full low moon looked over the valleys as pallid and holy as some aureoled saint a sound of laughter and dream was on the wind and the world grew young with the mirth of April breezes
Its so nice to be alive in the spring said the Story Girl one twilight as we swung on the boughs of Uncle Stephens walk
Its nice to be alive any time said Felicity complacently
But its nicer in the spring insisted the Story Girl
When Im dead I think Ill FEEL dead all the rest of the year but when spring comes Im sure Ill feel like getting up and being alive again
You do say such queer things complained Felicity
You wont be really dead any time
Youll be in the next world
And I think its horrid to talk about people being dead anyhow
Weve all got to die said Sara Ray solemnly but with a certain relish
It was as if she enjoyed looking forward to something in which nothing neither an unsympathetic mother nor the cruel fate which had made her a colourless little nonentity could prevent her from being the chief performer
I sometimes think said Cecily rather wearily that it isnt so dreadful to die young as I used to suppose
She prefaced her remark with a slight cough as she had been all too apt to do of late for the remnants of the cold she had caught the night we were lost in the storm still clung to her
Dont talk such nonsense Cecily cried the Story Girl with unwonted sharpness a sharpness we all understood
All of us in our hearts though we never spoke of it to each other thought Cecily was not as well as she ought to be that spring and we hated to hear anything said which seemed in any way to touch or acknowledge the tiny faint shadow which now and again showed itself dimly athwart our sunshine
Well it was you began talking of being dead said Felicity angrily
I dont think its right to talk of such things
Cecily are you sure your feet aint damp
We ought to go in anyhowits too chilly out here for you
You girls had better go said Dan but I aint going in till old Isaac Frewen goes
Ive no use for him
I hate him too said Felicity agreeing with Dan for once in her life
He chews tobacco all the time and spits on the floor the horrid pig
And yet his brother is an elder in the church said Sara Ray wonderingly
I know a story about Isaac Frewen said the Story Girl
When he was young he went by the name of Oatmeal Frewen and he got it this way
He was noted for doing outlandish things
He lived at Markdale then and he was a great overgrown awkward fellow six feet tall
He drove over to Baywater one Saturday to visit his uncle there and came home the next afternoon and although it was Sunday he brought a big bag of oatmeal in the wagon with him
When he came to Carlisle church he saw that service was going on there and he concluded to stop and go in
But he didnt like to leave his oatmeal outside for fear something would happen to it because there were always mischievous boys around so he hoisted the bag on his back and walked into church with it and right to the top of the aisle to Grandfather Kings pew
Grandfather King used to say he would never forget it to his dying day
The minister was preaching and everything was quiet and solemn when he heard a snicker behind him
Grandfather King turned around with a terrible frownfor you know in those days it was thought a dreadful thing to laugh in churchto rebuke the offender and what did he see but that great hulking young Isaac stalking up the aisle bending a little forward under the weight of a big bag of oatmeal
Grandfather King was so amazed he couldnt laugh but almost everyone else in the church was laughing and grandfather said he never blamed them for no funnier sight was ever seen
Young Isaac turned into grandfathers pew and thumped the bag of oatmeal down on the seat with a thud that cracked it
Then he plumped down beside it took off his hat wiped his face and settled back to listen to the sermon just as if it was all a matter of course
When the service was over he hoisted his bag up again marched out of church and drove home
He could never understand why it made so much talk but he was known by the name of Oatmeal Frewen for years
Our laughter as we separated rang sweetly through the old orchard and across the far dim meadows
Felicity and Cecily went into the house and Sara Ray and the Story Girl went home but Peter decoyed me into the granary to ask advice
You know Felicity has a birthday next week he said and I want to write her an ode
Aa what
I gasped
An ode repeated Peter gravely
Its poetry you know
Ill put it in Our Magazine
But you cant write poetry Peter I protested
Im going to try said Peter stoutly
That is if you think she wont be offended at me
She ought to feel flattered I replied
You never can tell how shell take things said Peter gloomily
Of course I aint going to sign my name and if she aint pleased I wont tell her I wrote it
Dont you let on
I promised I wouldnt and Peter went off with a light heart
He said he meant to write two lines every day till he got it done
Cupid was playing his worldold tricks with others than poor Peter that spring
Allusion has been made in these chronicles to one Cyrus Brisk and to the fact that our brownhaired softvoiced Cecily had found favour in the eyes of the said Cyrus
Cecily did not regard her conquest with any pride
On the contrary it annoyed her terribly to be teased about Cyrus
She declared she hated both him and his name
She was as uncivil to him as sweet Cecily could be to anyone but the gallant Cyrus was nothing daunted
He laid determined siege to Cecilys young heart by all the methods known to lovelorn swains
He placed delicate tributes of spruce gum molasses taffy conversation candies and decorated slate pencils on her desk he persistently chose her in all school games calling for a partner he entreated to be allowed to carry her basket from school he offered to work her sums for her and rumour had it that he had made a wild statement to the effect that he meant to ask if he might see her home some night from prayer meeting
Cecily was quite frightened that he would she confided to me that she would rather die than walk home with him but that if he asked her she would be too bashful to say no
So far however Cyrus had not molested her out of school nor had he as yet thumped Willy Fraserwho was reported to be very low in his spirits over the whole affair
And now Cyrus had written Cecily a lettera love letter mark you
Moreover he had sent it through the postoffice with a real stamp on it
Its arrival made a sensation among us
Dan brought it from the office and recognizing the handwriting of Cyrus gave Cecily no peace until she showed us the letter
It was a very sentimental and rather illspelled epistle in which the inflammable Cyrus reproached her in heartrending words for her coldness and begged her to answer his letter saying that if she did he would keep the secret in violets
Cyrus probably meant inviolate but Cecily thought it was intended for a poetical touch
He signed himself your troo lover Cyrus Brisk and added in a postcript that he couldnt eat or sleep for thinking of her
Are you going to answer it
asked Dan
Certainly not said Cecily with dignity
Cyrus Brisk wants to be kicked growled Felix who never seemed to be any particular friend of Willy Frasers either
Hed better learn how to spell before he takes to writing love letters
Maybe Cyrus will starve to death if you dont suggested Sara Ray
I hope he will said Cecily cruelly
She was truly vexed over the letter and yet so contradictory a thing is the feminine heart even at twelve years old I think she was a little flattered by it also
It was her first love letter and she confided to me that it gives you a very queer feeling to get it
At all eventsthe letter though unanswered was not torn up
I feel sure Cecily preserved it
But she walked past Cyrus next morning at school with a frozen countenance evincing not the slightest pity for his pangs of unrequited affection
Cecily winced when Pat caught a mouse visited a school chum the day the pigs were killed that she might not hear their squealing and would not have stepped on a caterpillar for anything yet she did not care at all how much she made the brisk Cyrus suffer
Then suddenly all our spring gladness and Maytime hopes were blighted as by a killing frost
Sorrow and anxiety pervaded our days and embittered our dreams by night
Grim tragedy held sway in our lives for the next fortnight
Paddy disappeared
One night he lapped his new milk as usual at Uncle Rogers dairy door and then sat blandly on the flat stone before it giving the world assurance of a cat sleek sides glistening plumy tail gracefully folded around his paws brilliant eyes watching the stir and flicker of bare willow boughs in the twilight air above him
That was the last seen of him
In the morning he was not
At first we were not seriously alarmed
Paddy was no roving Thomas but occasionally he vanished for a day or so
But when two days passed without his return we became anxious the third day worried us greatly and the fourth found us distracted
Something has happened to Pat the Story Girl declared miserably
He never stayed away from home more than two days in his life
What could have happened to him
asked Felix
Hes been poisonedor a dog has killed him answered the Story Girl in tragic tones
Cecily began to cry at this but tears were of no avail
Neither was anything else apparently
We searched every nook and cranny of barns and outbuildings and woods on both the King farms we inquired far and wide we roved over Carlisle meadows calling Paddys name until Aunt Janet grew exasperated and declared we must stop making such exhibitions of ourselves
But we found and heard no trace of our lost pet
The Story Girl moped and refused to be comforted Cecily declared she could not sleep at night for thinking of poor Paddy dying miserably in some corner to which he had dragged his failing body or lying somewhere mangled and torn by a dog
We hated every dog we saw on the ground that he might be the guilty one
Its the suspense thats so hard sobbed the Story Girl
If I just knew what had happened to him it wouldnt be QUITE so hard
But I dont know whether hes dead or alive
He may be living and suffering and every night I dream that he has come home and when I wake up and find its only a dream it just breaks my heart
Its ever so much worse than when he was so sick last fall said Cecily drearily
Then we knew that everything was done for him that could be done
We could not appeal to Peg Bowen this time
In our desperation we would have done it but Peg was far away
With the first breath of spring she was up and off answering to the lure of the long road
She had not been seen in her accustomed haunts for many a day
Her pets were gaining their own living in the woods and her house was locked up
CHAPTER XI THE WITCHS WISHBONE When a fortnight had elapsed we gave up all hope
Pat is dead said the Story Girl hopelessly as we returned one evening from a bootless quest to Andrew Cowans where a strange gray cat had been reporteda cat which turned out to be a yellowish brown nondescript with no tail to speak of
Im afraid so I acknowledged at last
If only Peg Bowen had been at home she could have found him for us asserted Peter
Her skull would have told her where he was
I wonder if the wishbone she gave me would have done any good cried Cecily suddenly
Id forgotten all about it
Oh do you suppose its too late yet
Theres nothing in a wishbone said Dan impatiently
You cant be sure
She TOLD me Id get the wish I made on it
Im going to try whenever I get home
It cant do any harm anyhow said Peter but Im afraid youve left it too late
If Pat is dead even a witchs wishbone cant bring him back to life
Ill never forgive myself for not thinking about it before mourned Cecily
As soon as we got home she flew to the little box upstairs where she kept her treasures and brought therefrom the dry and brittle wishbone
Peg told me how it must be done
Im to hold the wishbone with both hands like this and walk backward repeating the wish nine times
And when Ive finished the ninth time Im to turn around nine times from right to left and then the wish will come true right away
Do you expect to see Pat when you finish turning
said Dan skeptically
None of us had any faith in the incantation except Peter and by infection Cecily
You never could tell what might happen
Cecily took the wishbone in her trembling little hands and began her backward pacing repeating solemnly I wish that we may find Paddy alive or else his body so that we can bury him decently
By the time Cecily had repeated this nine times we were all slightly infected with the desperate hope that something might come of it and when she had made her nine gyrations we looked eagerly down the sunset lane half expecting to see our lost pet
But we saw only the Awkward Man turning in at the gate
This was almost as surprising as the sight of Pat himself would have been but there was no sign of Pat and hope flickered out in every breast but Peters
Youve got to give the spell time to work he expostulated
If Pat was miles away when it was wished it wouldnt be reasonable to expect to see him right off
But we of little faith had already lost that little and it was a very disconsolate group which the Awkward Man presently joined
He was smilinghis rare beautiful smile which only children ever sawand he lifted his hat to the girls with no trace of the shyness and awkwardness for which he was notorious
Good evening he said
Have you little people lost a cat lately
We stared
Peter said I knew it
in a triumphant pigs whisper
The Story Girl started eagerly forward
Oh Mr Dale can you tell us anything of Paddy
she cried
A silver gray cat with black points and very fine marking
Yes yes
Alive
Yes
Well doesnt that beat the Dutch
muttered Dan
But we were all crowding about the Awkward Man demanding where and when he had found Paddy
Youd better come over to my place and make sure that it really is your cat suggested the Awkward Man and Ill tell you all about finding him on the way
I must warn you that he is pretty thinbut I think hell pull through
We obtained permission to go without much difficulty although the spring evening was wearing late for Aunt Janet said she supposed none of us would sleep a wink that night if we didnt
A joyful procession followed the Awkward Man and the Story Girl across the gray starlitten meadows to his home and through his pineguarded gate
You know that old barn of mine back in the woods
said the Awkward Man
I go to it only about once in a blue moon
There was an old barrel there upside down one side resting on a block of wood
This morning I went to the barn to see about having some hay hauled home and I had occasion to move the barrel
I noticed that it seemed to have been moved slightly since my last visit and it was now resting wholly on the floor
I lifted it upand there was a cat lying on the floor under it
I had heard you had lost yours and I took it this was your pet
I was afraid he was dead at first
He was lying there with his eyes closed but when I bent over him he opened them and gave a pitiful little mew or rather his mouth made the motion of a mew for he was too weak to utter a sound
Oh poor poor Paddy said tenderhearted Cecily tearfully
He couldnt stand so I carried him home and gave him just a little milk
Fortunately he was able to lap it
I gave him a little more at intervals all day and when I left he was able to crawl around
I think hell be all right but youll have to be careful how you feed him for a few days
Dont let your hearts run away with your judgment and kill him with kindness
Do you suppose any one put him under that barrel
asked the Story Girl
No
The barn was locked
Nothing but a cat could get in
I suppose he went under the barrel perhaps in pursuit of a mouse and somehow knocked it off the block and so imprisoned himself
Paddy was sitting before the fire in the Awkward Mans clean bare kitchen
Thin
Why he was literally skin and bone and his fur was dull and lustreless
It almost broke our hearts to see our beautiful Paddy brought so low
Oh how he must have suffered
moaned Cecily
Hell be as prosperous as ever in a week or two said the Awkward Man kindly
The Story Girl gathered Paddy up in her arms
Most mellifluously did he purr as we crowded around to stroke him with friendly joy he licked our hands with his little red tongue poor Paddy was a thankful cat he was no longer lost starving imprisoned helpless he was with his comrades once more and he was going homehome to his old familiar haunts of orchard and dairy and granary to his daily rations of new milk and cream to the cosy corner of his own fireside
We trooped home joyfully the Story Girl in our midst carrying Paddy hugged against her shoulder
Never did April stars look down on a happier band of travellers on the golden road
There was a little gray wind out in the meadows that night and it danced along beside us on viewless fairy feet and sang a delicate song of the lovely waiting years while the night laid her beautiful hands of blessing over the world
You see what Pegs wishbone did said Peter triumphantly
Now look here Peter dont talk nonsense expostulated Dan
The Awkward Man found Paddy this morning and had started to bring us word before Cecily ever thought of the wishbone
Do you mean to say you believe he wouldnt have come walking up our lane just when he did if she had never thought of it
I mean to say that I wouldnt mind if I had several wishbones of the same kind retorted Peter stubbornly
Of course I dont think the wishbone had really anything to do with our getting Paddy back but Im glad I tried it for all that remarked Cecily in a tone of satisfaction
Well anyhow weve got Pat and thats the main thing said Felix
And I hope it will be a lesson to him to stay home after this commented Felicity
They say the barrens are full of mayflowers said the Story Girl
Let us have a mayflower picnic tomorrow to celebrate Paddys safe return
CHAPTER XII FLOWERS O MAY Accordingly we went amaying following the lure of dancing winds to a certain westward sloping hill lying under the spiritlike blue of spring skies feathered over with lisping young pines and firs which cupped little hollows and corners where the sunshine got in and never got out again but stayed there and grew mellow coaxing dear things to bloom long before they would dream of waking up elsewhere
Twas there we found our mayflowers after faithful seeking
Mayflowers you must know never flaunt themselves they must be sought as becomes them and then they will yield up their treasures to the seekerclusters of starwhite and dawnpink that have in them the very soul of all the springs that ever were re incarnated in something it seems gross to call perfume so exquisite and spiritual is it
We wandered gaily over the hill calling to each other with laughter and jest getting parted and delightfully lost in that little pathless wilderness and finding each other unexpectedly in nooks and dips and sunny silences where the wind purred and gentled and went softly
When the sun began to hang low sending great fanlike streamers of radiance up to the zenith we foregathered in a tiny sequestered valley full of young green fern lying in the shadow of a wooded hill
In it was a shallow poola glimmering green sheet of water on whose banks nymphs might dance as blithely as ever they did on Argive hill or in Cretan dale
There we sat and stripped the faded leaves and stems from our spoil making up the blossoms into bouquets to fill our baskets with sweetness
The Story Girl twisted a spray of divinest pink in her brown curls and told us an old legend of a beautiful Indian maiden who died of a broken heart when the first snows of winter were falling because she believed her longabsent lover was false
But he came back in the spring time from his long captivity and when he heard that she was dead he sought her grave to mourn her and lo under the dead leaves of the old year he found sweet sprays of a blossom never seen before and knew that it was a message of love and remembrance from his darkeyed sweetheart
Except in stories Indian girls are called squaws remarked practical Dan tying his mayflowers together in one huge solid cabbagelike bunch
Not for Dan the bother of filling his basket with the loose sprays mingled with feathery elephantsears and trails of creeping spruce as the rest of us following the Story Girls example did
Nor would he admit that ours looked any better than his
I like things of one kind together
I dont like them mixed he said
You have no taste said Felicity
Except in my mouth best beloved responded Dan
You do think you are so smart retorted Felicity flushing with anger
Dont quarrel this lovely day implored Cecily
Nobodys quarrelling Sis
I aint a bit mad
Its Felicity
What on earth is that at the bottom of your basket Cecily
Its a History of the Reformation in France confessed poor Cecily by a man named Daubigny
I cant pronounce it
I heard Mr Marwood saying it was a book everyone ought to read so I began it last Sunday
I brought it along today to read when I got tired picking flowers
Id ever so much rather have brought Ester Reid
Theres so much in the history I cant understand and it is so dreadful to read of people being burned to death
But I felt I OUGHT to read it
Do you really think your mind has improved any
asked Sara Ray seriously wreathing the handle of her basket with creeping spruce
No Im afraid it hasnt one bit answered Cecily sadly
I feel that I havent succeeded very well in keeping my resolutions
Ive kept mine said Felicity complacently
Its easy to keep just one retorted Cecily rather resentfully
Its not so easy to think beautiful thoughts answered Felicity
Its the easiest thing in the world said the Story Girl tiptoeing to the edge of the pool to peep at her own arch reflection as some nymph left over from the golden age might do
Beautiful thoughts just crowd into your mind at times
Oh yes AT TIMES
But thats different from thinking one REGULARLY at a given hour
And mother is always calling up the stairs for me to hurry up and get dressed and its VERY hard sometimes
Thats so conceded the Story Girl
There ARE times when I cant think anything but gray thoughts
Then other days I think pink and blue and gold and purple and rainbow thoughts all the time
The idea
As if thoughts were coloured giggled Felicity
Oh they are
cried the Story Girl
Why I can always SEE the colour of any thought I think
Cant you
I never heard of such a thing declared Felicity and I dont believe it
I believe you are just making that up
Indeed Im not
Why I always supposed everyone thought in colours
It must be very tiresome if you dont
When you think of me what colour is it
asked Peter curiously
Yellow answered the Story Girl promptly
And Cecily is a sweet pink like those mayflowers and Sara Ray is very pale blue and Dan is red and Felix is yellow like Peter and Bev is striped
What colour am I
asked Felicity amid the laughter at my expense
Youreyoure like a rainbow answered the Story Girl rather reluctantly
She had to be honest but she would rather not have complimented Felicity
And you neednt laugh at Bev
His stripes are beautiful
It isnt HE that is striped
Its just the THOUGHT of him
Peg Bowen is a queer sort of yellowish green and the Awkward Man is lilac
Aunt Olivia is pansypurple mixed with gold and Uncle Roger is navy blue
I never heard such nonsense declared Felicity
The rest of us were rather inclined to agree with her for once
We thought the Story Girl was making fun of us
But I believe she really had a strange gift of thinking in colours
In later years when we were grown up she told me of it again
She said that everything had colour in her thought the months of the year ran through all the tints of the spectrum the days of the week were arrayed as Solomon in his glory morning was golden noon orange evening crystal blue and night violet
Every idea came to her mind robed in its own especial hue
Perhaps that was why her voice and words had such a charm conveying to the listeners perception such fine shadings of meaning and tint and music
Well lets go and have something to eat suggested Dan
What colour is eating Sara
Golden brown just the colour of a molasses cooky laughed the Story Girl
We sat on the ferny bank of the pool and ate of the generous basket Aunt Janet had provided with appetites sharpened by the keen spring air and our wilderness rovings
Felicity had made some very nice sandwiches of ham which we all appreciated except Dan who declared he didnt like things minced up and dug out of the basket a chunk of boiled pork which he proceeded to saw up with a jackknife and devour with gusto
I told ma to put this in for me
Theres some CHEW to it he said
You are not a bit refined commented Felicity
Not a morsel my love grinned Dan
You make me think of a story I heard Uncle Roger telling about Cousin Annetta King said the Story Girl
Greatuncle Jeremiah King used to live where Uncle Roger lives now when Grandfather King was alive and Uncle Roger was a boy
In those days it was thought rather coarse for a young lady to have too hearty an appetite and she was more admired if she was delicate about what she ate
Cousin Annetta set out to be very refined indeed
She pretended to have no appetite at all
One afternoon she was invited to tea at Grandfather Kings when they had some special companypeople from Charlottetown
Cousin Annetta said she could hardly eat anything
You know Uncle Abraham she said in a very affected fineyounglady voice I really hardly eat enough to keep a bird alive
Mother says she wonders how I continue to exist
And she picked and pecked until Grandfather King declared he would like to throw something at her
After tea Cousin Annetta went home and just about dark Grandfather King went over to Uncle Jeremiahs on an errand
As he passed the open lighted pantry window he happened to glance in and what do you think he saw
Delicate Cousin Annetta standing at the dresser with a big loaf of bread beside her and a big platterful of cold boiled pork in front of her and Annetta was hacking off great chunks like Dan there and gobbling them down as if she was starving
Grandfather King couldnt resist the temptation
He stepped up to the window and said Im glad your appetite has come back to you Annetta
Your mother neednt worry about your continuing to exist as long as you can tuck away fat salt pork in that fashion
Cousin Annetta never forgave him but she never pretended to be delicate again
The Jews dont believe in eating pork said Peter
Im glad Im not a Jew and I guess Cousin Annetta was too said Dan
I like bacon but I can never look at a pig without wondering if they were ever intended to be eaten remarked Cecily naively
When we finished our lunch the barrens were already wrapping themselves in a dim blue dusk and falling upon rest in dell and dingle
But out in the open there was still much light of a fine emeraldgolden sort and the robins whistled us home in it
Horns of Elfland never sounded more sweetly around hoary castle and ruined fane than those vesper calls of the robins from the twilight spruce woods and across green pastures lying under the pale radiance of a young moon
When we reached home we found that Miss Reade had been up to the hill farm on an errand and was just leaving
The Story Girl went for a walk with her and came back with an important expression on her face
You look as if you had a story to tell said Felix
One is growing
It isnt a whole story yet answered the Story Girl mysteriously
What is it
asked Cecily
I cant tell you till its fully grown said the Story Girl
But Ill tell you a pretty little story the Awkward Man told us told metonight
He was walking in his garden as we went by looking at his tulip beds
His tulips are up ever so much higher than ours and I asked him how he managed to coax them along so early
And he said HE didnt do itit was all the work of the pixies who lived in the woods across the brook
There were more pixy babies than usual this spring and the mothers were in a hurry for the cradles
The tulips are the pixy babies cradles it seems
The mother pixies come out of the woods at twilight and rock their tiny little brown babies to sleep in the tulip cups
That is the reason why tulip blooms last so much longer than other blossoms
The pixy babies must have a cradle until they are grown up
They grow very fast you see and the Awkward Man says on a spring evening when the tulips are out you can hear the sweetest softest clearest fairy music in his garden and it is the pixy folk singing as they rock the pixy babies to sleep
Then the Awkward Man says what isnt true said Felicity severely
CHAPTER XIII A SURPRISING ANNOUNCEMENT Nothing exciting has happened for ever so long said the Story Girl discontentedly one late May evening as we lingered under the wonderful white bloom of the cherry trees
There was a long row of them in the orchard with a Lombardy poplar at either end and a hedge of lilacs behind
When the wind blew over them all the spicy breezes of Ceylons isle were never sweeter
It was a time of wonder and marvel of the soft touch of silver rain on greening fields of the incredible delicacy of young leaves of blossom in field and garden and wood
The whole world bloomed in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness instinct with all the evasive fleeting charm of spring and girlhood and young morning
We felt and enjoyed it all without understanding or analyzing it
It was enough to be glad and young with spring on the golden road
I dont like excitement very much said Cecily
It makes one so tired
Im sure it was exciting enough when Paddy was missing but we didnt find that very pleasant
No but it was interesting returned the Story Girl thoughtfully
After all I believe Id rather be miserable than dull
I wouldnt then said Felicity decidedly
And you need never be dull when you have work to do
Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do
Well mischief is interesting laughed the Story Girl
And I thought you didnt think it ladylike to speak of that person Felicity
Its all right if you call him by his polite name said Felicity stiffly
Why does the Lombardy poplar hold its branches straight up in the air like that when all the other poplars hold theirs out or hang them down
interjected Peter who had been gazing intently at the slender spire showing darkly against the fine blue eastern sky
Because it grows that way said Felicity
Oh I know a story about that cried the Story Girl
Once upon a time an old man found the pot of gold at the rainbows end
There IS a pot there it is said but it is very hard to find because you can never get to the rainbows end before it vanishes from your sight
But this old man found it just at sunset when Iris the guardian of the rainbow gold happened to be absent
As he was a long way from home and the pot was very big and heavy he decided to hide it until morning and then get one of his sons to go with him and help him carry it
So he hid it under the boughs of the sleeping poplar tree
When Iris came back she missed the pot of gold and of course she was in a sad way about it
She sent Mercury the messenger of the gods to look for it for she didnt dare leave the rainbow again lest somebody should run off with that too
Mercury asked all the trees if they had seen the pot of gold and the elm oak and pine pointed to the poplar and said The poplar can tell you where it is
How can I tell you where it is
cried the poplar and she held up all her branches in surprise just as we hold up our handsand down tumbled the pot of gold
The poplar was amazed and indignant for she was a very honest tree
She stretched her boughs high above her head and declared that she would always hold them like that so that nobody could hide stolen gold under them again
And she taught all the little poplars she knew to stand the same way and that is why Lombardy poplars always do
But the aspen poplar leaves are always shaking even on the very calmest day
And do you know why
And then she told us the old legend that the cross on which the Saviour of the world suffered was made of aspen poplar wood and so never again could its poor shaken shivering leaves know rest or peace
There was an aspen in the orchard the very embodiment of youth and spring in its litheness and symmetry
Its little leaves were hanging tremulously not yet so fully blown as to hide its development of bough and twig making poetry against the spiritual tints of a spring sunset
It does look sad said Peter but it is a pretty tree and it wasnt its fault
Theres a heavy dew and its time we stopped talking nonsense and went in decreed Felicity
If we dont well all have a cold and then well be miserable enough but it wont be very exciting
All the same I wish something exciting would happen finished the Story Girl as we walked up through the orchard peopled with its nunlike shadows
Theres a new moon tonight so may be youll get your wish said Peter
My Aunt Jane didnt believe there was anything in the moon business but you never can tell
The Story Girl did get her wish
Something happened the very next day
She joined us in the afternoon with a quite indescribable expression on her face compounded of triumph anticipation and regret
Her eyes betrayed that she had been crying but in them shone a chastened exultation
Whatever the Story Girl mourned over it was evident she was not without hope
I have some news to tell you she said importantly
Can you guess what it is
We couldnt and wouldnt try
Tell us right off implored Felix
You look as if it was something tremendous
So it is
ListenAunt Olivia is going to be married
We stared in blank amazement
Peg Bowens hint had faded from our minds and we had never put much faith in it
Aunt Olivia
I dont believe it cried Felicity flatly
Who told you
Aunt Olivia herself
So it is perfectly true
Im awfully sorry in one waybut oh wont it be splendid to have a real wedding in the family
Shes going to have a big weddingand I am to be bridesmaid
I shouldnt think you were old enough to be a bridesmaid said Felicity sharply
Im nearly fifteen
Anyway Aunt Olivia says I have to be
Whos she going to marry
asked Cecily gathering herself together after the shock and finding that the world was going on just the same
His name is Dr Seton and he is a Halifax man
She met him when she was at Uncle Edwards last summer
Theyve been engaged ever since
The wedding is to be the third week in June
And our school concert comes off the next week complained Felicity
Why do things always come together like that
And what are you going to do if Aunt Olivia is going away
Im coming to live at your house answered the Story Girl rather timidly
She did not know how Felicity might like that
But Felicity took it rather well
Youve been here most of the time anyhow so itll just be that youll sleep and eat here too
But whats to become of Uncle Roger
Aunt Olivia says hell have to get married too
But Uncle Roger says hed rather hire a housekeeper than marry one because in the first case he could turn her off if he didnt like her but in the second case he couldnt
Therell be a lot of cooking to do for the wedding reflected Felicity in a tone of satisfaction
I spose Aunt Olivia will want some rusks made
I hope she has plenty of toothpowder laid in said Dan
Its a pity you dont use some of that toothpowder youre so fond of talking about yourself retorted Felicity
When anyone has a mouth the size of yours the teeth show so plain
I brush my teeth every Sunday asseverated Dan
Every Sunday
You ought to brush them every DAY
Did anyone ever hear such nonsense
demanded Dan sincerely
Well you know it really does say so in the Family Guide said Cecily quietly
Then the Family Guide people must have lots more spare time than I have retorted Dan contemptuously
Just think the Story Girl will have her name in the papers if shes bridesmaid marvelled Sara Ray
In the Halifax papers too added Felix since Dr Seton is a Halifax man
What is his first name
Robert
And will we have to call him Uncle Robert
Not until hes married to her
Then we will of course
I hope your Aunt Olivia wont disappear before the ceremony remarked Sara Ray who was surreptitiously reading The Vanquished Bride by Valeria H Montague in the Family Guide
I hope Dr Seton wont fail to show up like your cousin Rachel Wards beau said Peter
That makes me think of another story I read the other day about Greatuncle Andrew King and Aunt Georgina laughed the Story Girl
It happened eighty years ago
It was a very stormy winter and the roads were bad
Uncle Andrew lived in Carlisle and Aunt Georginashe was Miss Georgina Matheson thenlived away up west so he couldnt get to see her very often
They agreed to be married that winter but Georgina couldnt set the day exactly because her brother who lived in Ontario was coming home for a visit and she wanted to be married while he was home
So it was arranged that she was to write Uncle Andrew and tell him what day to come
She did and she told him to come on a Tuesday
But her writing wasnt very good and poor Uncle Andrew thought she wrote Thursday
So on Thursday he drove all the way to Georginas home to be married
It was forty miles and a bitter cold day
But it wasnt any colder than the reception he got from Georgina
She was out in the porch with her head tied up in a towel picking geese
She had been all ready Tuesday and her friends and the minister were there and the wedding supper prepared
But there was no bridegroom and Georgina was furious
Nothing Uncle Andrew could say would appease her
She wouldnt listen to a word of explanation but told him to go and never show his nose there again
So poor Uncle Andrew had to go ruefully home hoping that she would relent later on because he was really very much in love with her
And did she
queried Felicity
She did
Thirteen years exactly from that day they were married
It took her just that long to forgive him
It took her just that long to find out she couldnt get anybody else said Dan cynically
CHAPTER XIV A PRODIGAL RETURNS Aunt Olivia and the Story Girl lived in a whirlwind of dressmaking after that and enjoyed it hugely
Cecily and Felicity also had to have new dresses for the great event and they talked of little else for a fortnight
Cecily declared that she hated to go to sleep because she was sure to dream that she was at Aunt Olivias wedding in her old faded gingham dress and a ragged apron
And no shoes or stockings she added and I cant move and everyone walks past and looks at my feet
Thats only in a dream mourned Sara Ray but I may have to wear my last summers white dress to the wedding
Its too short but ma says its plenty good for this summer
Ill be so mortified if I have to wear it
Id rather not go at all than wear a dress that wasnt nice said Felicity pleasantly
Id go to the wedding if I had to go in my school dress cried Sara Ray
Ive never been to anything
I wouldnt miss it for the world
My Aunt Jane always said that if you were neat and tidy it didnt matter whether you were dressed fine or not said Peter
Im sick and tired of hearing about your Aunt Jane said Felicity crossly
Peter looked grieved but held his peace
Felicity was very hard on him that spring but his loyalty never wavered
Everything she said or did was right in Peters eyes
Its all very well to be neat and tidy said Sara Ray but I like a little style too
I think youll find your mother will get you a new dress after all comforted Cecily
Anyway nobody will notice you because everyone will be looking at the bride
Aunt Olivia will make a lovely bride
Just think how sweet shell look in a white silk dress and a floating veil
She says she is going to have the ceremony performed out here in the orchard under her own tree said the Story Girl
Wont that be romantic
It almost makes me feel like getting married myself
What a way to talk rebuked Felicity and you only fifteen
Lots of people have been married at fifteen laughed the Story Girl
Lady Jane Gray was
But you are always saying that Valeria H Montagues stories are silly and not true to life so that is no argument retorted Felicity who knew more about cooking than about history and evidently imagined that the Lady Jane Gray was one of Valerias titled heroines
The wedding was a perennial source of conversation among us in those days but presently its interest palled for a time in the light of another quite tremendous happening
One Saturday night Peters mother called to take him home with her for Sunday
She had been working at Mr James Frewens and Mr Frewen was driving her home
We had never seen Peters mother before and we looked at her with discreet curiosity
She was a plump blackeyed little woman neat as a pin but with a rather tired and careworn face that looked as if it should have been rosy and jolly
Life had been a hard battle for her and I rather think that her curly headed little lad was all that had kept heart and spirit in her
Peter went home with her and returned Sunday evening
We were in the orchard sitting around the Pulpit Stone where we had according to the custom of the households of King been learning our golden texts and memory verses for the next Sunday School lesson
Paddy grown sleek and handsome again was sitting on the stone itself washing his jowls
Peter joined us with a very queer expression on his face
He seemed bursting with some news which he wanted to tell and yet hardly liked to
Why are you looking so mysterious Peter
demanded the Story Girl
What do you think has happened
asked Peter solemnly
What has
My father has come home answered Peter
The announcement produced all the sensation he could have wished
We crowded around him in excitement
Peter
When did he come back
Saturday night
He was there when ma and I got home
It give her an awful turn
I didnt know him at first of course
Peter Craig I believe you are glad your father has come back cried the Story Girl
Course Im glad retorted Peter
And after you saying you didnt want ever to see him again said Felicity
You just wait
You havent heard my story yet
I wouldnt have been glad to see father if hed come back the same as he went away
But he is a changed man
He happened to go into a revival meeting one night this spring and he got converted
And hes come home to stay and he says hes never going to drink another drop but hes going to look after his family
Ma isnt to do any more washing for nobody but him and me and Im not to be a hired boy any longer
He says I can stay with your Uncle Roger till the fall cause I promised I would but after that Im to stay home and go to school right along and learn to be whatever Id like to be
I tell you it made me feel queer
Everything seemed to be upset
But he gave ma forty dollarsevery cent he hadso I guess he really is converted
I hope it will last Im sure said Felicity
She did not say it nastily however
We were all glad for Peters sake though a little dizzy over the unexpectedness of it all
This is what ID like to know said Peter
How did Peg Bowen know my father was coming home
Dont you tell me she isnt a witch after that
And she knew about your Aunt Olivias wedding too added Sara Ray
Oh well she likely heard that from some one
Grown up folks talk things over long before they tell them to children said Cecily
Well she couldnt have heard father was coming home from any one answered Peter
He was converted up in Maine where nobody knew him and he never told a soul he was coming till he got here
No you can believe what you like but Im satisfied at last that Peg is a witch and that skull of hers does tell her things
She told me father was coming home and he come
How happy you must be sighed Sara Ray romantically
Its just like that story in the Family Guide where the missing earl comes home to his family just as the Countess and Lady Violetta are going to be turned out by the cruel heir
Felicity sniffed
Theres some difference I guess
The earl had been imprisoned for years in a loathsome dungeon
Perhaps Peters father had too if we but realized itimprisoned in the dungeon of his own evil appetites and habits than which none could be more loathsome
But a Power mightier than the forces of evil had struck off his fetters and led him back to his longforfeited liberty and light
And no countess or lady of high degree could have welcomed a longlost earl home more joyfully than the tired little washerwoman had welcomed the erring husband of her youth
But in Peters ointment of joy there was a fly or two
So very very few things are flawless in this world even on the golden road
Of course Im awful glad that father has come back and that ma wont have to wash any more he said with a sigh but there are two things that kind of worry me
My Aunt Jane always said that it didnt do any good to worry and I spose it dont but its kind of a relief
Whats worrying you
asked Felix
Well for one thing Ill feel awful bad to go away from you all
Ill miss you just dreadful and I wont even be able to go to the same school
Ill have to go to Markdale school
But you must come and see us often said Felicity graciously
Markdale isnt so far away and you could spend every other Saturday afternoon with us anyway
Peters black eyes filled with adoring gratitude
Thats so kind of you Felicity
Ill come as often as I can of course but it wont be the same as being around with you all the time
The other thing is even worse
You see it was a Methodist revival father got converted in and so of course he joined the Methodist church
He wasnt anything before
He used to say he was a Nothingarian and lived up to itkind of bragging like
But hes a strong Methodist now and is going to go to Markdale Methodist church and pay to the salary
Now whatll he say when I tell him Im a Presbyterian
You havent told him yet
asked the Story Girl
No I didnt dare
I was scared hed say Id have to be a Methodist
Well Methodists are pretty near as good as Presbyterians said Felicity with the air of one making a great concession
I guess theyre every bit as good retorted Peter
But that aint the point
Ive got to be a Presbyterian cause I stick to a thing when I once decide it
But I expect father will be mad when he finds out
If hes converted he oughtnt to get mad said Dan
Well lots o people do
But if he isnt mad hell be sorry and thatll be even worse for a Presbyterian Im bound to be
But I expect it will make things unpleasant
You neednt tell him anything about it advised Felicity
Just keep quiet and go to the Methodist church until you get big and then you can go where you please
No that wouldnt be honest said Peter sturdily
My Aunt Jane always said it was best to be open and above board in everything and especially in religion
So Ill tell father right out but Ill wait a few weeks so as not to spoil things for ma too soon if he acts up
Peter was not the only one who had secret cares
Sara Ray was beginning to feel worried over her looks
I heard her and Cecily talking over their troubles one evening while I was weeding the onion bed and they were behind the hedge knitting lace
I did not mean to eavesdrop
I supposed they knew I was there until Cecily overwhelmed me with indignation later on
Im so afraid Cecily that Im going to be homely all my life said poor Sara with a tremble in her voice
You can stand being ugly when you are young if you have any hope of being better looking when you grow up
But Im getting worse
Aunt Mary says Im going to be the very image of Aunt Matilda
And Aunt Matilda is as homely as she can be
It isntand poor Sara sigheda very cheerful prospect
If I am ugly nobody will ever want to marry me and concluded Sara candidly I dont want to be an old maid
But plenty of girls get married who arent a bit pretty comforted Cecily
Besides you are real nice looking at times Sara
I think you are going to have a nice figure
But just look at my hands moaned Sara
Theyre simply covered with warts
Oh the warts will all disappear before you grow up said Cecily
But they wont disappear before the school concert
How am I to get up there and recite
You know there is one line in my recitation She waved her lilywhite hand and I have to wave mine when I say it
Fancy waving a lilywhite hand all covered with warts
Ive tried every remedy I ever heard of but nothing does any good
Judy Pineau said if I rubbed them with toadspit it would take them away for sure
But how am I to get any toad spit
It doesnt sound like a very nice remedy anyhow shuddered Cecily
Id rather have the warts
But do you know I believe if you didnt cry so much over every little thing youd be ever so much better looking
Crying spoils your eyes and makes the end of your nose red
I cant help crying protested Sara
My feelings are so very sensitive
Ive given up trying to keep THAT resolution
Well men dont like crybabies said Cecily sagely
Cecily had a good deal of Mother Eves wisdom tucked away in that smooth brown head of hers
Cecily do you ever intend to be married
asked Sara in a confidential tone
Goodness
cried Cecily quite shocked
It will be time enough when I grow up to think of that Sara
I should think youd have to think of it now with Cyrus Brisk as crazy after you as he is
I wish Cyrus Brisk was at the bottom of the Red Sea exclaimed Cecily goaded into a spurt of temper by mention of the detested name
What has Cyrus been doing now
asked Felicity coming around the corner of the hedge
Doing NOW
Its ALL the time
He just worries me to death returned Cecily angrily
He keeps writing me letters and putting them in my desk or in my reader
I never answer one of them but he keeps on
And in the last one mind you he said hed do something desperate right off if I wouldnt promise to marry him when we grew up
Just think Cecily youve had a proposal already said Sara Ray in an awestruck tone
But he hasnt done anything desperate yet and that was last week commented Felicity with a toss of her head
He sent me a lock of his hair and wanted one of mine in exchange continued Cecily indignantly
I tell you I sent his back to him pretty quick
Did you never answer any of his letters
asked Sara Ray
No indeed
I guess not
Do you know said Felicity I believe if you wrote him just once and told him your exact opinion of him in good plain English it would cure him of his nonsense
I couldnt do that
I havent enough spunk confessed Cecily with a blush
But Ill tell you what I did do once
He wrote me a long letter last week
It was just awfully SOFT and every other word was spelled wrong
He even spelled baking soda bacon soda
What on earth had he to say about baking soda in a loveletter
asked Felicity
Oh he said his mother sent him to the store for some and he forgot it because he was thinking about me
Well I just took his letter and wrote in all the words spelled right above the wrong ones in red ink just as Mr Perkins makes us do with our dictation exercises and sent it back to him
I thought maybe hed feel insulted and stop writing to me
And did he
No he didnt
It is my opinion you cant insult Cyrus Brisk
He is too thickskinned
He wrote another letter and thanked me for correcting his mistakes and said it made him feel glad because it showed I was beginning to take an interest in him when I wanted him to spell better
Did you ever
Miss Marwood says it is wrong to hate anyone but I dont care I hate Cyrus Brisk
Mrs Cyrus Brisk WOULD be an awful name giggled Felicity
Flossie Brisk says Cyrus is ruining all the trees on his fathers place cutting your name on them said Sara Ray
His father told him he would whip him if he didnt stop but Cyrus keeps right on
He told Flossie it relieved his feelings
Flossie says he cut yours and his together on the birch tree in front of the parlour window and a row of hearts around them
Just where every visitor can see them I suppose lamented Cecily
He just worries my life out
And what I mind most of all is he sits and looks at me in school with such melancholy reproachful eyes when he ought to be working sums
I wont look at him but I FEEL him staring at me and it makes me so nervous
They say his mother was out of her mind at one time said Felicity
I do not think Felicity was quite well pleased that Cyrus should have passed over her rosered prettiness to set his affections on that demure elf of a Cecily
She did not want the allegiance of Cyrus in the least but it was something of a slight that he had not wanted her to want it
And he sends me pieces of poetry he cuts out of the papers Cecily went on with lots of the lines marked with a lead pencil
Yesterday he put one in his letter and this is what he marked If you will not relent to me Then must I learn to know Darkness alone till life be flown
HereI have the piece in my sewingbagIll read it all to you
Those three graceless girls read the sentimental rhyme and giggled over it
Poor Cyrus
His young affections were sadly misplaced
But after all though Cecily never relented towards him he did not condemn himself to darkness alone till life was flown
Quite early in life he wedded a stout rosy buxom lass the very antithesis of his first love he prospered in his undertakings raised a large and respectable family and was eventually appointed a Justice of the Peace
Which was all very sensible of Cyrus
CHAPTER XV THE RAPE OF THE LOCK June was crowded full of interest that year
We gathered in with its sheaf of fragrant days the choicest harvest of childhood
Things happened right along
Cecily declared she hated to go to sleep for fear she might miss something
There were so many dear delights along the golden road to give us pleasurethe earth dappled with new blossom the dance of shadows in the fields the rustling rainwet ways of the woods the faint fragrance in meadow lanes liltings of birds and croon of bees in the old orchard windy pipings on the hills sunset behind the pines limpid dews filling primrose cups crescent moons through darklings boughs soft nights alight with blinking stars
We enjoyed all these boons unthinkingly and lightheartedly as children do
And besides these there was the absorbing little drama of human life which was being enacted all around us and in which each of us played a satisfying partthe gay preparations for Aunt Olivias midJune wedding the excitement of practising for the concert with which our schoolteacher Mr Perkins had elected to close the school year and Cecilys troubles with Cyrus Brisk which furnished unholy mirth for the rest of us though Cecily could not see the funny side of it at all
Matters went from bad to worse in the case of the irrepressible Cyrus
He continued to shower Cecily with notes the spelling of which showed no improvement he worried the life out of her by constantly threatening to fight Willy Fraseralthough as Felicity sarcastically pointed out he never did it
But Im always afraid he will said Cecily and it would be such a DISGRACE to have two boys fighting over me in school
You must have encouraged Cyrus a little in the beginning or hed never have been so persevering said Felicity unjustly
I never did
cried outraged Cecily
You know very well Felicity King that I hated Cyrus Brisk ever since the very first time I saw his big fat red face
So there
Felicity is just jealous because Cyrus didnt take a notion to her instead of you Sis said Dan
Talk sense
snapped Felicity
If I did you wouldnt understand me sweet little sister rejoined aggravating Dan
Finally Cyrus crowned his iniquities by stealing the denied lock of Cecilys hair
One sunny afternoon in school Cecily and Kitty Marr asked and received permission to sit out on the side bench before the open window where the cool breeze swept in from the green fields beyond
To sit on this bench was always considered a treat and was only allowed as a reward of merit but Cecily and Kitty had another reason for wishing to sit there
Kitty had read in a magazine that sunbaths were good for the hair so both she and Cecily tossed their long braids over the windowsill and let them hang there in the broiling sunshine
And while Cecily sat thus diligently working a fraction sum on her slate that base Cyrus asked permission to go out having previously borrowed a pair of scissors from one of the big girls who did fancy work at the noon recess
Outside Cyrus sneaked up close to the window and cut off a piece of Cecilys hair
This rape of the lock did not produce quite such terrible consequences as the more famous one in Popes poem but Cecilys soul was no less agitated than Belindas
She cried all the way home from school about it and only checked her tears when Dan declared hed fight Cyrus and make him give it up
Oh no You mustnt
said Cecily struggling with her sobs
I wont have you fighting on my account for anything
And besides hed likely lick youhes so big and rough
And the folks at home might find out all about it and Uncle Roger would never give me any peace and mother would be cross for shed never believe it wasnt my fault
It wouldnt be so bad if hed only taken a little but he cut a great big chunk right off the end of one of the braids
Just look at it
Ill have to cut the other to make them fairand theyll look so awful stubby
But Cyrus acquirement of the chunk of hair was his last triumph
His downfall was near and although it involved Cecily in a most humiliating experience over which she cried half the following night in the end she confessed it was worth undergoing just to get rid of Cyrus
Mr Perkins was an exceedingly strict disciplinarian
No communication of any sort was permitted between his pupils during school hours
Anyone caught violating this rule was promptly punished by the infliction of one of the weird penances for which Mr Perkins was famous and which were generally far worse than ordinary whipping
One day in school Cyrus sent a letter across to Cecily
Usually he left his effusions in her desk or between the leaves of her books but this time it was passed over to her under cover of the desk through the hands of two or three scholars
Just as Em Frewen held it over the aisle Mr Perkins wheeled around from his station before the blackboard and caught her in the act
Bring that here Emmeline he commanded
Cyrus turned quite pale
Em carried the note to Mr Perkins
He took it held it up and scrutinized the address
Did you write this to Cecily Emmeline
he asked
No sir
Who wrote it then
Em said quite shamelessly that she didnt knowit had just been passed over from the next row
And I suppose you have no idea where it came from
said Mr Perkins with his frightful sardonic grin
Well perhaps Cecily can tell us
You may take your seat Emmeline and you will remain at the foot of your spelling class for a week as punishment for passing the note
Cecily come here
Indignant Em sat down and poor innocent Cecily was haled forth to public ignominy
She went with a crimson face
Cecily said her tormentor do you know who wrote this letter to you
Cecily like a certain renowned personage could not tell a lie
II think so sir she murmured faintly
Who was it
I cant tell you that stammered Cecily on the verge of tears
Ah
said Mr Perkins politely
Well I suppose I could easily find out by opening it
But it is very impolite to open other peoples letters
I think I have a better plan
Since you refuse to tell me who wrote it open it yourself take this chalk and copy the contents on the blackboard that we may all enjoy them
And sign the writers name at the bottom
Oh gasped Cecily choosing the lesser of two evils Ill tell you who wrote itit was Hush
Mr Perkins checked her with a gentle motion of his hand
He was always most gentle when most inexorable
You did not obey me when I first ordered you to tell me the writer
You cannot have the privilege of doing so now
Open the note take the chalk and do as I command you
Worms will turn and even meek mild obedient little souls like Cecily may be goaded to the point of wild sheer rebellion
II wont
she cried passionately
Mr Perkins martinet though he was would hardly I think have inflicted such a punishment on Cecily who was a favourite of his had he known the real nature of that luckless missive
But as he afterwards admitted he thought it was merely a note from some other girl of such trifling sort as schoolgirls are wont to write and moreover he had already committed himself to the decree which like those of Mede and Persian must not alter
To let Cecily off after her mad defiance would be to establish a revolutionary precedent
So you really think you wont
he queried smilingly
Well on second thoughts you may take your choice
Either you will do as I have bidden you or you will sit for three days withMr Perkins eye skimmed over the schoolroom to find a boy who was sitting alonewith Cyrus Brisk
This choice of Mr Perkins who knew nothing of the little drama of emotions that went on under the routine of lessons and exercises in his domain was purely accidental but we took it at the time as a stroke of diabolical genius
It left Cecily no choice
She would have done almost anything before she would have sat with Cyrus Brisk
With flashing eyes she tore open the letter snatched up the chalk and dashed at the blackboard
In a few minutes the contents of that letter graced the expanse usually sacred to more prosaic compositions
I cannot reproduce it verbatim for I had no after opportunity of refreshing my memory
But I remember that it was exceedingly sentimental and exceedingly illspelledfor Cecily mercilessly copied down poor Cyrus mistakes
He wrote her that he wore her hare over his hartand he stole it Cecily threw passionately over her shoulder at Mr Perkinsthat her eyes were so sweet and lovely that he couldnt find words nice enuf to describ them that he could never forget how butiful she had looked in prar meeting the evening before and that some meels he couldnt eat for thinking of her with more to the same effect and he signed it yours till deth us do part Cyrus Brisk
As the writing proceeded we scholars exploded into smothered laughter despite our awe of Mr Perkins
Mr Perkins himself could not keep a straight face
He turned abruptly away and looked out of the window but we could see his shoulders shaking
When Cecily had finished and had thrown down the chalk with bitter vehemence he turned around with a very red face
That will do
You may sit down
Cyrus since it seems you are the guilty person take the eraser and wipe that off the board
Then go stand in the corner facing the room and hold your arms straight above your head until I tell you to take them down
Cyrus obeyed and Cecily fled to her seat and wept nor did Mr Perkins meddle with her more that day
She bore her burden of humiliation bitterly for several days until she was suddenly comforted by a realization that Cyrus had ceased to persecute her
He wrote no more letters he gazed no longer in rapt adoration he brought no more votive offerings of gum and pencils to her shrine
At first we thought he had been cured by the unmerciful chaffing he had to undergo from his mates but eventually his sister told Cecily the true reason
Cyrus had at last been driven to believe that Cecilys aversion to him was real and not merely the defence of maiden coyness
If she hated him so intensely that she would rather write that note on the blackboard than sit with him what use was it to sigh like a furnace longer for her
Mr Perkins had blighted loves young dream for Cyrus with a killing frost
Thenceforth sweet Cecily kept the noiseless tenor of her way unvexed by the attentions of enamoured swains
CHAPTER XVI AUNT UNAS STORY Felicity and Cecily Dan Felix Sara Ray and I were sitting one evening on the mossy stones in Uncle Rogers hill pasture where we had sat the morning the Story Girl told us the tale of the Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess
But it was evening now and the valley beneath us was brimmed up with the glow of the afterlight
Behind us two tall shapely spruce trees rose up against the sunset and through the dark oriel of their sundered branches an evening star looked down
We sat on a little strip of emerald grassland and before us was a sloping meadow all white with daisies
We were waiting for Peter and the Story Girl
Peter had gone to Markdale after dinner to spend the afternoon with his reunited parents because it was his birthday
He had left us grimly determined to confess to his father the dark secret of his Presbyterianism and we were anxious to know what the result had been
The Story Girl had gone that morning with Miss Reade to visit the latters home near Charlottetown and we expected soon to see her coming gaily along over the fields from the Armstrong place
Presently Peter came jauntily stepping along the field path up the hill
Hasnt Peter got tall
said Cecily
Peter is growing to be a very fine looking boy decreed Felicity
I notice hes got ever so much handsomer since his father came home said Dan with a killing sarcasm that was wholly lost on Felicity who gravely responded that she supposed it was because Peter felt so much freer from care and responsibility
What luck Peter
yelled Dan as soon as Peter was within earshot
Everythings all right he shouted jubilantly
I told father right off lickettysplit as soon as I got home he added when he reached us
I was anxious to have it over with
I says solemnlike Dad theres something Ive got to tell you and I dont know how youll take it but it cant be helped I says
Dad looked pretty sober and he says says he What have you been up to Peter
Dont be afraid to tell me
Ive been forgiven to seventy times seven so surely I can forgive a little too
Well I says desperatelike the truth is father Im a Presbyterian
I made up my mind last summer the time of the Judgment Day that Id be a Presbyterian and Ive got to stick to it
Im sorry I cant be a Methodist like you and mother and Aunt Jane but I cant and thats all there is to it I says
Then I waited scaredlike
But father he just looked relieved and he says says he Goodness boy you can be a Presbyterian or anything else you like so long as its Protestant
Im not caring he says
The main thing is that you must be good and do whats right
I tell you concluded Peter emphatically father is a Christian all right
Well I suppose your mind will be at rest now said Felicity
Whats that you have in your buttonhole
Thats a fourleaved clover answered Peter exultantly
That means good luck for the summer
I found it in Markdale
There aint much clover in Carlisle this year of any kind of leaf
The crop is going to be a failure
Your Uncle Roger says its because there aint enough old maids in Carlisle
Theres lots of them in Markdale and thats the reason he says why they always have such good clover crops there
What on earth have old maids to do with it
cried Cecily
I dont believe theyve a single thing to do with it but Mr Roger says they have and he says a man called Darwin proved it
This is the rigmarole he got off to me the other day
The clover crop depends on there being plenty of bumblebees because they are the only insects with tongues long enough totofer fertilizeI think he called it the blossoms
But mice eat bumblebees and cats eat mice and old maids keep cats
So your Uncle Roger says the more old maids the more cats and the more cats the fewer fieldmice and the fewer fieldmice the more bumblebees and the more bumblebees the better clover crops
So dont worry if you do get to be old maids girls said Dan
Remember youll be helping the clover crops
I never heard such stuff as you boys talk said Felicity and Uncle Roger is no better
There comes the Story Girl cried Cecily eagerly
Now well hear all about Beautiful Alices home
The Story Girl was bombarded with eager questions as soon as she arrived
Miss Reades home was a dream of a place it appeared
The house was just covered with ivy and there was a most delightful old gardenand added the Story Girl with the joy of a connoisseur who has found a rare gem the sweetest little story connected with it
And I saw the hero of the story too
Where was the heroine
queried Cecily
She is dead
Oh of course shed have to die exclaimed Dan in disgust
Id like a story where somebody lived once in awhile
Ive told you heaps of stories where people lived retorted the Story Girl
If this heroine hadnt died there wouldnt have been any story
She was Miss Reades aunt and her name was Una and I believe she must have been just like Miss Reade herself
Miss Reade told me all about her
When we went into the garden I saw in one corner of it an old stone bench arched over by a couple of pear trees and all grown about with grass and violets
And an old man was sitting on ita bent old man with long snowwhite hair and beautiful sad blue eyes
He seemed very lonely and sorrowful and I wondered that Miss Reade didnt speak to him
But she never let on she saw him and took me away to another part of the garden
After awhile he got up and went away and then Miss Reade said Come over to Aunt Unas seat and I will tell you about her and her loverthat man who has just gone out
Oh isnt he too old for a lover
I said
Beautiful Alice laughed and said it was forty years since he had been her Aunt Unas lover
He had been a tall handsome young man then and her Aunt Una was a beautiful girl of nineteen
We went over and sat down and Miss Reade told me all about her
She said that when she was a child she had heard much of her Aunt Unathat she seemed to have been one of those people who are not soon forgotten whose personality seems to linger about the scenes of their lives long after they have passed away
What is a personality
Is it another word for ghost
asked Peter
No said the Story Girl shortly
I cant stop in a story to explain words
I dont believe you know what it is yourself said Felicity
The Story Girl picked up her hat which she had thrown down on the grass and placed it defiantly on her brown curls
Im going in she announced
I have to help Aunt Olivia ice a cake tonight and you all seem more interested in dictionaries than stories
Thats not fair I exclaimed
Dan and Felix and Sara Ray and Cecily and I have never said a word
Its mean to punish us for what Peter and Felicity did
We want to hear the rest of the story
Never mind what a personality is but go onand Peter you young ass keep still
I only wanted to know muttered Peter sulkily
I DO know what personality is but its hard to explain said the Story Girl relenting
Its what makes you different from Dan Peter and me different from Felicity or Cecily
Miss Reades Aunt Una had a personality that was very uncommon
And she was beautiful too with white skin and nightblack eyes and haira moonlight beauty Miss Reade called it
She used to keep a kind of a diary and Miss Reades mother used to read parts of it to her
She wrote verses in it and they were lovely and she wrote descriptions of the old garden which she loved very much
Miss Reade said that everything in the garden plot or shrub or tree recalled to her mind some phrase or verse of her Aunt Unas so that the whole place seemed full of her and her memory haunted the walks like a faint sweet perfume
Una had as Ive told you a lover and they were to have been married on her twentieth birthday
Her wedding dress was to have been a gown of white brocade with purple violets in it
But a little while before it she took ill with fever and died and she was buried on her birthday instead of being married
It was just in the time of opening roses
Her lover has been faithful to her ever since he has never married and every June on her birthday he makes a pilgrimage to the old garden and sits for a long time in silence on the bench where he used to woo her on crimson eves and moonlight nights of long ago
Miss Reade says she always loves to see him sitting there because it gives her such a deep and lasting sense of the beauty and strength of love which can thus outlive time and death
And sometimes she says it gives her a little eerie feeling too as if her Aunt Una were really sitting there beside him keeping tryst although she has been in her grave for forty years
It would be real romantic to die young and have your lover make a pilgrimage to your garden every year reflected Sara Ray
It would be more comfortable to go on living and get married to him said Felicity
Mother says all those sentimental ideas are bosh and I expect they are
Its a wonder Beautiful Alice hasnt a beau herself
She is so pretty and ladylike
The Carlisle fellows all say she is too stuck up said Dan
Theres nobody in Carlisle half good enough for her cried the Story Girl exceptexcept Except who
asked Felix
Never mind said the Story Girl mysteriously
CHAPTER XVII AUNT OLIVIAS WEDDING What a delightful oldfashioned wholesome excitement there was about Aunt Olivias wedding
The Monday and Tuesday preceding it we did not go to school at all but were all kept home to do chores and run errands
The cooking and decorating and arranging that went on those two days was amazing and Felicity was so happy over it all that she did not even quarrel with Danthough she narrowly escaped it when he told her that the Governors wife was coming to the wedding
Mind you have some of her favourite rusks for her he said
I guess said Felicity with dignity that Aunt Olivias wedding supper will be good enough for even a Governors wife
I spose none of us except the Story Girl will get to the first table said Felix rather gloomily
Never mind comforted Felicity
Theres a whole turkey to be kept for us and a freezerful of ice cream
Cecily and I are going to wait on the tables and well put away a little of everything thats extra nice for our suppers
I do so want to have my supper with you sighed Sara Ray but I spose ma will drag me with her wherever she goes
She wont trust me out of her sight a minute the whole eveningI know she wont
Ill get Aunt Olivia to ask her to let you have your supper with us said Cecily
She cant refuse the brides request
You dont know all ma can do returned Sara darkly
No I feel that Ill have to eat my supper with her
But I suppose I ought to be very thankful Im to get to the wedding at all and that ma did get me a new white dress for it
Even yet Im so scared something will happen to prevent me from getting to it
Monday evening shrouded itself in clouds and all night long the voice of the wind answered to the voice of the rain
Tuesday the downpour continued
We were quite frantic about it
Suppose it kept on raining over Wednesday
Aunt Olivia couldnt be married in the orchard then
That would be too bad especially when the late apple tree had most obligingly kept its store of blossom until after all the other trees had faded and then burst lavishly into bloom for Aunt Olivias wedding
That apple tree was always very late in blooming and this year it was a week later than usual
It was a sight to seea great treepyramid with high far spreading boughs over which a wealth of rosy snow seemed to have been flung
Never had bride a more magnificent canopy
To our rapture however it cleared up beautifully Tuesday evening and the sun before setting in purple pomp poured a flood of wonderful radiance over the whole great green diamond dripping world promising a fair morrow
Uncle Alec drove off to the station through it to bring home the bridegroom and his best man
Dan was full of a wild idea that we should all meet them at the gate armed with cowbells and tinpans and charivari them up the lane
Peter sided with him but the rest of us voted down the suggestion
Do you want Dr Seton to think we are a pack of wild Indians
asked Felicity severely
A nice opinion hed have of our manners
Well its the only chance well have to chivaree them grumbled Dan
Aunt Olivia wouldnt mind
SHE can take a joke
Ma would kill you if you did such a thing warned Felicity
Dr Seton lives in Halifax and they NEVER chivaree people there
He would think it very vulgar
Then he should have stayed in Halifax and got married there retorted Dan sulkily
We were very curious to see our uncleelect
When he came and Uncle Alec took him into the parlour we were all crowded into the dark corner behind the stairs to peep at him
Then we fled to the moonlight world outside and discussed him at the dairy
Hes bald said Cecily disappointedly
And RATHER short and stout said Felicity
Hes forty if hes a day said Dan
Never you mind cried the Story Girl loyally Aunt Olivia loves him with all her heart
And more than that hes got lots of money added Felicity
Well he may be all right said Peter but its my opinion that your Aunt Olivia could have done just as well on the Island
YOUR opinion doesnt matter very much to our family said Felicity crushingly
But when we made the acquaintance of Dr Seton next morning we liked him enormously and voted him a jolly good fellow
Even Peter remarked aside to me that he guessed Miss Olivia hadnt made much of a mistake after all though it was plain he thought she was running a risk in not sticking to the Island
The girls had not much time to discuss him with us
They were all exceedingly busy and whisked about at such a rate that they seemed to possess the power of being in half a dozen places at once
The importance of Felicity was quite terrible
But after dinner came a lull
Thank goodness everything is ready at last breathed Felicity devoutly as we foregathered for a brief space in the fir wood
Weve nothing more to do now but get dressed
Its really a serious thing to have a wedding in the family
I have a note from Sara Ray said Cecily
Judy Pineau brought it up when she brought Mrs Rays spoons
Just let me read it to you DEAREST CECILYA DREADFUL MISFORTUNE has happened to me
Last night I went with Judy to water the cows and in the spruce bush we found a WASPS NEST and Judy thought it was AN OLD ONE and she POKED IT WITH A STICK
And it was a NEW ONE full of wasps and they all flew out and STUNG US TERRIBLY on the face and hands
My face is all swelled up and I can HARDLY SEE out of one eye
The SUFFERING was awful but I didnt mind that as much as being scared ma wouldnt take me to the wedding
But she says I can go and Im going
I know that I am a HARDLOOKING SIGHT but it isnt anything catching
I am writing this so that you wont get a shock when you see me
Isnt it SO STRANGE to think your dear Aunt Olivia is going away
How you will miss her
But your loss will be her gain
Au revoir Your loving chum SARA RAY
That poor child said the Story Girl
Well all I hope is that strangers wont take her for one of the family remarked Felicity in a disgusted tone
Aunt Olivia was married at five oclock in the orchard under the late apple tree
It was a pretty scene
The air was full of the perfume of apple bloom and the bees blundered foolishly and delightfully from one blossom to another half drunken with perfume
The old orchard was full of smiling guests in wedding garments
Aunt Olivia was most beautiful amid the frost of her bridal veil and the Story Girl in an unusually long white dress with her brown curls clubbed up behind looked so tall and grown up that we hardly recognized her
After the ceremonyduring which Sara Ray cried all the timethere was a royal wedding supper and Sara Ray was permitted to eat her share of the feast with us
Im glad I was stung by the wasps after all she said delightedly
If I hadnt been ma would never have let me eat with you
She just got tired explaining to people what was the matter with my face and so she was glad to get rid of me
I know I look awful but oh wasnt the bride a dream
We missed the Story Girl who of course had to have her supper at the bridal table but we were a hilarious little crew and the girls had nobly kept their promise to save tidbits for us
By the time the last table was cleared away Aunt Olivia and our new uncle were ready to go
There was an orgy of tears and leavetakings and then they drove away into the odorous moonlight night
Dan and Peter pursued them down the lane with a fiendish din of bells and pans much to Felicitys wrath
But Aunt Olivia and Uncle Robert took it in good part and waved their hands back to us with peals of laughter
Theyre just that pleased with themselves that they wouldnt mind if there was an earthquake said Felix grinning
Its been splendid and exciting and everything went off well sighed Cecily but oh dear its going to be so queer and lonesome without Aunt Olivia
I just believe Ill cry all night
Youre tired to death thats whats the matter with you said Dan returning
You girls have worked like slaves today
Tomorrow will be even harder said Felicity comfortingly
Everything will have to be cleaned up and put away
Peg Bowen paid us a call the next day and was regaled with a feast of fat things left over from the supper
Well Ive had all I can eat she said when she had finished and brought out her pipe
And that doesnt happen to me every day
There aint been as much marrying as there used to be and half the time they just sneak off to the minister as if they were ashamed of it and get married without any wedding or supper
That aint the King way though
And so Olivias gone off at last
She werent in any hurry but they tell me shes done well
Timell show
Why dont you get married yourself Peg
queried Uncle Roger teasingly
We held our breath over his temerity
Because Im not so easy to please as your wife will be retorted Peg
She departed in high good humour over her repartee
Meeting Sara Ray on the doorstep she stopped and asked her what was the matter with her face
Wasps stammered Sara Ray laconic from terror
Humph
And your hands
Warts
Ill tell you whatll take them away
You get a pertater and go out under the full moon cut the pertater in two rub your warts with one half and say One two three warts go away from me
Then rub them with the other half and say One two three four warts never trouble me more
Then bury the pertater and never tell a living soul where you buried it
You wont have no more warts
Mind you bury the pertater though
If you dont and anyone picks it up shell get your warts
CHAPTER XVIII SARA RAY HELPS OUT We all missed Aunt Olivia greatly she had been so merry and companionable and had possessed such a knack of understanding small fry
But youth quickly adapts itself to changed conditions in a few weeks it seemed as if the Story Girl had always been living at Uncle Alecs and as if Uncle Roger had always had a fat jolly housekeeper with a double chin and little twinkling blue eyes
I dont think Aunt Janet ever quite got over missing Aunt Olivia or looked upon Mrs Hawkins as anything but a necessary evil but life resumed its even tenor on the King farm broken only by the ripples of excitement over the school concert and letters from Aunt Olivia describing her trip through the land of Evangeline
We incorporated the letters in Our Magazine under the heading From Our Special Correspondent and were very proud of them
At the end of June our school concert came off and was a great event in our young lives
It was the first appearance of most of us on any platform and some of us were very nervous
We all had recitations except Dan who had refused flatly to take any part and was consequently carefree
Im sure I shall die when I find myself up on that platform facing people sighed Sara Ray as we talked the affair over in Uncle Stephens Walk the night before the concert
Im afraid Ill faint was Cecilys more moderate foreboding
Im not one single bit nervous said Felicity complacently
Im not nervous this time said the Story Girl but the first time I recited I was
My Aunt Jane remarked Peter used to say that an old teacher of hers told her that when she was going to recite or speak in public she must just get it firmly into her mind that it was only a lot of cabbage heads she had before her and she wouldnt be nervous
One mightnt be nervous but I dont think there would be much inspiration in reciting to cabbage heads said the Story Girl decidedly
I want to recite to PEOPLE and see them looking interested and thrilled
If I can only get through my piece without breaking down I dont care whether I thrill people or not said Sara Ray
Im afraid Ill forget mine and get stuck foreboded Felix
Some of you fellows be sure and prompt me if I doand do it quick sos I wont get worse rattled
I know one thing said Cecily resolutely and that is Im going to curl my hair for tomorrow night
Ive never curled it since Peter almost died but I simply must tomorrow night for all the other girls are going to have theirs in curls
The dew and heat will take all the curl out of yours and then youll look like a scarecrow warned Felicity
No I wont
Im going to put my hair up in paper tonight and wet it with a curlingfluid that Judy Pineau uses
Sara brought me up a bottle of it
Judy says it is great stuffyour hair will keep in curl for days no matter how damp the weather is
Ill leave my hair in the papers till tomorrow evening and then Ill have beautiful curls
Youd better leave your hair alone said Dan gruffly
Smooth hair is better than a lot of flyaway curls
But Cecily was not to be persuaded
Curls she craved and curls she meant to have
Im thankful my warts have all gone anyway said Sara Ray
So they have exclaimed Felicity
Did you try Pegs recipe
Yes
I didnt believe in it but I tried it
For the first few days afterwards I kept watching my warts but they didnt go away and then I gave up and forgot them
But one day last week I just happened to look at my hands and there wasnt a wart to be seen
It was the most amazing thing
And yet youll say Peg Bowen isnt a witch said Peter
Pshaw it was just the potato juice scoffed Dan
It was a dry old potato I had and there wasnt much juice in it said Sara Ray
One hardly knows what to believe
But one thing is certainmy warts are gone
Cecily put her hair up in curlpapers that night thoroughly soaked in Judy Pineaus curlingfluid
It was a nasty job for the fluid was very sticky but Cecily persevered and got it done
Then she went to bed with a towel tied over her head to protect the pillow
She did not sleep well and had uncanny dreams but she came down to breakfast with an expression of triumph
The Story Girl examined her head critically and said Cecily if I were you Id take those papers out this morning
Oh no if I do my hair will be straight again by night
I mean to leave them in till the last minute
I wouldnt do thatI really wouldnt persisted the Story Girl
If you do your hair will be too curly and all bushy and fuzzy
Cecily finally yielded and went upstairs with the Story Girl
Presently we heard a little shriekthen two little shrieksthen three
Then Felicity came flying down and called her mother
Aunt Janet went up and presently came down again with a grim mouth
She filled a large pan with warm water and carried it upstairs
We dared ask her no questions but when Felicity came down to wash the dishes we bombarded her
What on earth is the matter with Cecily
demanded Dan
Is she sick
No she isnt
I warned her not to put her hair in curls but she wouldnt listen to me
I guess she wishes she had now
When people havent natural curly hair they shouldnt try to make it curly
They get punished if they do
Look here Felicity never mind all that
Just tell us what has happened Sis
Well this is what has happened her
That ninny of a Sara Ray brought up a bottle of mucilage instead of Judys curlingfluid and Cecily put her hair up with THAT
Its in an awful state
Good gracious
exclaimed Dan
Look here will she ever get it out
Goodness knows
Shes got her head in soak now
Her hair is just matted together hard as a board
Thats what comes of vanity said Felicity than whom no vainer girl existed
Poor Cecily paid dearly enough for HER vanity
She spent a bad forenoon made no easier by her mothers severe rebukes
For an hour she soaked her head that is she stood over a panful of warm water and kept dipping her head in with tightly shut eyes
Finally her hair softened sufficiently to be disentangled from the curl papers and then Aunt Janet subjected it to a merciless shampoo
Eventually they got all the mucilage washed out of it and Cecily spent the remainder of the forenoon sitting before the open oven door in the hot kitchen drying her illused tresses
She felt very downhearted her hair was of that order which glossy and smooth normally is dry and harsh and lustreless for several days after being shampooed
Ill look like a fright tonight said the poor child to me with trembling voice
The ends will be sticking out all over my head
Sara Ray is a perfect idiot I said wrathfully Qh dont be hard on poor Sara
She didnt mean to bring me mucilage
Its really all my own fault I know
I made a solemn vow when Peter was dying that I would never curl my hair again and I should have kept it
It isnt right to break solemn vows
But my hair will look like dried hay tonight
Poor Sara Ray was quite overwhelmed when she came up and found what she had done
Felicity was very hard on her and Aunt Janet was coldly disapproving but sweet Cecily forgave her unreservedly and they walked to the school that night with their arms about each others waists as usual
The schoolroom was crowded with friends and neighbours
Mr Perkins was flying about getting things into readiness and Miss Reade who was the organist of the evening was sitting on the platform looking her sweetest and prettiest
She wore a delightful white lace hat with a fetching little wreath of tiny forgetmenots around the brim a white muslin dress with sprays of blue violets scattered over it and a black lace scarf
Doesnt she look angelic
said Cecily rapturously
Mind you said Sara Ray the Awkward Man is herein the corner behind the door
I never remember seeing him at a concert before
I suppose he came to hear the Story Girl recite said Felicity
He is such a friend of hers
The concert went off very well
Dialogues choruses and recitations followed each other in rapid succession
Felix got through his without getting stuck and Peter did excellently though he stuffed his hands in his trousers pocketsa habit of which Mr Perkins had vainly tried to break him
Peters recitation was one greatly in vogue at that time beginning My name is Norval on the Grampian hills My father feeds his flocks
At our first practice Peter had started gaily in rushing through the first line with no thought whatever of punctuation My name is Norval on the Grampian Hills
Stop stop Peter quoth Mr Perkins sarcastically your name might be Norval if you were never on the Grampian Hills
Theres a semicolon in that line I wish you to remember
Peter did remember it
Cecily neither fainted nor failed when it came her turn
She recited her little piece very well though somewhat mechanically
I think she really did much better than if she had had her desired curls
The miserable conviction that her hair alone among that glossytressed bevy was looking badly quite blotted out all nervousness and selfconsciousness from her mind
Her hair apart she looked very pretty
The prevailing excitement had made bright her eye and flushed her cheeks rosily too rosily perhaps
I heard a Carlisle woman behind me whisper that Cecily King looked consumptive just like her Aunt Felicity and I hated her fiercely for it
Sara Ray also managed to get through respectably although she was pitiably nervous
Her bow was naught but a short nodas if her head worked on wires whispered Felicity uncharitablyand the wave of her lilywhite hand more nearly resembled an agonized jerk than a wave
We all felt relieved when she finished
She was in a sense one of our crowd and we had been afraid she would disgrace us by breaking down
Felicity followed her and recited her selection without haste without rest and absolutely without any expression whatever
But what mattered it how she recited
To look at her was sufficient
What with her splendid fleece of golden curls her great brilliant blue eyes her exquisitely tinted face her dimpled hands and arms every member of the audience must have felt it was worth the ten cents he had paid merely to see her
The Story Girl followed
An expectant silence fell over the room and Mr Perkins face lost the look of tense anxiety it had worn all the evening
Here was a performer who could be depended on
No need to fear stage fright or forgetfulness on her part
The Story Girl was not looking her best that night
White never became her and her face was pale though her eyes were splendid
But nobody thought about her appearance when the power and magic of her voice caught and held her listeners spellbound
Her recitation was an old one figuring in one of the School Readers and we scholars all knew it off by heart
Sara Ray alone had not heard the Story Girl recite it
The latter had not been drilled at practices as had the other pupils Mr Perkins choosing not to waste time teaching her what she already knew far better than he did
The only time she had recited it had been at the dress rehearsal two nights before at which Sara Ray had not been present
In the poem a Florentine lady of old time wedded to a cold and cruel husband had died or was supposed to have died and had been carried to the rich the beautiful the dreadful tomb of her proud family
In the night she wakened from her trance and made her escape
Chilled and terrified she had made her way to her husbands door only to be driven away brutally as a restless ghost by the horrorstricken inmates
A similar reception awaited her at her fathers
Then she had wandered blindly through the streets of Florence until she had fallen exhausted at the door of the lover of her girlhood
He unafraid had taken her in and cared for her
On the morrow the husband and father having discovered the empty tomb came to claim her
She refused to return to them and the case was carried to the court of law
The verdict given was that a woman who had been to burial borne and left for dead who had been driven from her husbands door and from her childhood home must be adjudged as dead in law and fact was no more daughter or wife but was set free to form what new ties she would
The climax of the whole selection came in the line The court pronounces the defendantDEAD
and the Story Girl was wont to render it with such dramatic intensity and power that the veriest dullard among her listeners could not have missed its force and significance
She swept along through the poem royally playing on the emotions of her audience as she had so often played on ours in the old orchard
Pity terror indignation suspense possessed her hearers in turn
In the court scene she surpassed herself
She was in very truth the Florentine judge stern stately impassive
Her voice dropped into the solemnity of the all important line The court pronounces the defendant She paused for a breathless moment the better to bring out the tragic import of the last word
DEAD piped up Sara Ray in her shrill plaintive little voice
The effect to use a hackneyed but convenient phrase can better be imagined than described
Instead of the sigh of relieved tension that should have swept over the audience at the conclusion of the line a burst of laughter greeted it
The Story Girls performance was completely spoiled
She dealt the luckless Sara a glance that would have slain her on the spot could glances kill stumbled lamely and impotently through the few remaining lines of her recitation and fled with crimson cheeks to hide her mortification in the little corner that had been curtained off for a dressingroom
Mr Perkins looked things not lawful to be uttered and the audience tittered at intervals for the rest of the performance
Sara Ray alone remained serenely satisfied until the close of the concert when we surrounded her with a whirlwind of reproaches
Why she stammered aghast what did I do
II thought she was stuck and that I ought to prompt her quick
You little fool she just paused for effect cried Felicity angrily
Felicity might be rather jealous of the Story Girls gift but she was furious at beholding one of our family made ridiculous in such a fashion
You have less sense than anyone I ever heard of Sara Ray
Poor Sara dissolved in tears
I didnt know
I thought she was stuck she wailed again
She cried all the way home but we did not try to comfort her
We felt quite out of patience with her
Even Cecily was seriously annoyed
This second blunder of Saras was too much even for her loyalty
We saw her turn in at her own gate and go sobbing up her lane with no relenting
The Story Girl was home before us having fled from the schoolhouse as soon as the programme was over
We tried to sympathize with her but she would not be sympathized with
Please dont ever mention it to me again she said with compressed lips
I never want to be reminded of it
Oh that little IDIOT
She spoiled Peters sermon last summer and now shes spoiled your recitation said Felicity
I think its time we gave up associating with Sara Ray
Oh dont be quite so hard on her pleaded Cecily
Think of the life the poor child has to live at home
I know shell cry all night
Oh lets go to bed growled Dan
Im good and ready for it
Ive had enough of school concerts
CHAPTER XIX BY WAY OF THE STARS But for two of us the adventures of the night were not yet over
Silence settled down over the old housethe eerie whisperful creeping silence of night
Felix and Dan were already sound asleep I was drifting near the coast o dreams when I was aroused by a light tap on the door
Bev are you asleep
came in the Story Girls whisper
No what is it
Ssh Get up and dress and come out
I want you
With a good deal of curiosity and some misgiving I obeyed
What was in the wind now
Outside in the hall I found the Story Girl with a candle in her hand and her hat and jacket
Where are you going
I whispered in amazement
Hush
Ive got to go to the school and you must come with me
I left my coral necklace there
The clasp came loose and I was so afraid Id lose it that I took it off and put it in the bookcase
I was feeling so upset when the concert was over that I forgot all about it
The coral necklace was a very handsome one which had belonged to the Story Girls mother
She had never been permitted to wear it before and it had only been by dint of much coaxing that she had induced Aunt Janet to let her wear it to the concert
But theres no sense in going for it in the dead of night I objected
It will be quite safe
You can go for it in the morning
Lizzie Paxton and her daughter are going to clean the school tomorrow and I heard Lizzie say tonight she meant to be at it by five oclock to get through before the heat of the day
You know perfectly well what Liz Paxtons reputation is
If she finds that necklace Ill never see it again
Besides if I wait till the morning Aunt Janet may find out that I left it there and shed never let me wear it again
No Im going for it now
If youre afraid added the Story Girl with delicate scorn of course you neednt come
Afraid
Id show her
Come on I said
We slipped out of the house noiselessly and found ourselves in the unutterable solemnity and strangeness of a dark night
It was a new experience and our hearts thrilled and our nerves tingled to the charm of it
Never had we been abroad before at such an hour
The world around us was not the world of daylight
Twas an alien place full of weird evasive enchantment and magicry
Only in the country can one become truly acquainted with the night
There it has the solemn calm of the infinite
The dim wide fields lie in silence wrapped in the holy mystery of darkness
A wind loosened from wild places far away steals out to blow over dewy starlit immemorial hills
The air in the pastures is sweet with the hush of dreams and one may rest here like a child on its mothers breast
Isnt it wonderful
breathed the Story Girl as we went down the long hill
Do you know I can forgive Sara Ray now
I thought tonight I never couldbut now it doesnt matter any more
I can even see how funny it was
Oh wasnt it funny
DEAD in that squeaky little voice of Saras
Ill just behave to her tomorrow as if nothing had happened
It seems so long ago now here in the night
Neither of us ever forgot the subtle delight of that stolen walk
A spell of glamour was over us
The breezes whispered strange secrets of elfhaunted glens and the hollows where the ferns grew were brimmed with mystery and romance
Ghostlike scents crept out of the meadows to meet us and the fir wood before we came to the church was a living sweetness of Junebells growing in abundance
Junebells have another and more scientific name of course
But who could desire a better name than Junebells
They are so perfect in their way that they seem to epitomize the very scent and charm of the forest as if the old woods daintiest thoughts had materialized in blossom and not all the roses by Bendameers stream are as fragrant as a shallow sheet of Junebells under the boughs of fir
There were fireflies abroad that night too increasing the gramarye of it
There is certainly something a little supernatural about fireflies
Nobody pretends to understand them
They are akin to the tribes of fairy survivals of the elder time when the woods and hills swarmed with the little green folk
It is still very easy to believe in fairies when you see those goblin lanterns glimmering among the fir tassels
Isnt it beautiful
said the Story Girl in rapture
I wouldnt have missed it for anything
Im glad I left my necklace
And I am glad you are with me Bev
The others wouldnt understand so well
I like you because I dont have to talk to you all the time
Its so nice to walk with someone you dont have to talk to
Here is the graveyard
Are you frightened to pass it Bev
No I dont think Im frightened I answered slowly but I have a queer feeling
So have I
But it isnt fear
I dont know what it is
I feel as if something was reaching out of the graveyard to hold me something that wanted lifeI dont like itlets hurry
But isnt it strange to think of all the dead people in there who were once alive like you and me
I dont feel as if I could EVER die
Do you
No but everybody must
Of course we go on living afterwards just the same
Dont lets talk of such things here I said hurriedly
When we reached the school I contrived to open a window
We scrambled in lighted a lamp and found the missing necklace
The Story Girl stood on the platform and gave an imitation of the catastrophe of the evening that made me shout with laughter
We prowled around for sheer delight over being there at an unearthly hour when everybody supposed we were sound asleep in our beds
It was with regret that we left and we walked home as slowly as we could to prolong the adventure
Lets never tell anyone said the Story Girl as we reached home
Lets just have it as a secret between us for ever and eversomething that nobody else knows a thing about but you and me
Wed better keep it a secret from Aunt Janet anyhow I whispered laughing
Shed think we were both crazy
Its real jolly to be crazy once in a while said the Story Girl
CHAPTER XX EXTRACTS FROM OUR MAGAZINE EDITORIAL As will be seen there is no Honour Roll in this number
Even Felicity has thought all the beautiful thoughts that can be thought and cannot think any more
Peter has never got drunk but under existing circumstances that is not greatly to his credit
As for our written resolutions they have silently disappeared from our chamber walls and the place that once knew them knows them no more for ever
PETER PERPLEXEDLY Seems to me Ive heard something like that before
It is very sad but we will all make some new resolutions next year and maybe it will be easier to keep those
THE STORY OF THE LOCKET THAT WAS BAKED This was a story my Aunt Jane told me about her granma when she was a little girl
Its funny to think of baking a locket but it wasnt to eat
She was my great granma but Ill call her granma for short
It happened when she was ten years old
Of course she wasent anybodys granma then
Her father and mother and her were living in a new settlement called Brinsley
Their nearest naybor was a mile away
One day her Aunt Hannah from Charlottetown came and wanted her ma to go visiting with her
At first granmas ma thought she couldent go because it was baking day and granmas pa was away
But granma wasent afraid to stay alone and she knew how to bake the bread so she made her ma go and her Aunt Hannah took off the handsome gold locket and chain she was waring round her neck and hung it on granmas and told her she could ware it all day
Granma was awful pleased for she had never had any jewelry
She did all the chores and then was needing the loaves when she looked up and saw a tramp coming in and he was an awful villenus looking tramp
He dident even pass the time of day but just set down on a chair
Poor granma was awful fritened and she turned her back on him and went on needing the loaf cold and trembling that is granma was trembling not the loaf
She was worried about the locket
She didnt know how she could hide it for to get anywhere she would have to turn round and pass him
All of a suddent she thought she would hide it in the bread
She put her hand up and pulled it hard and quick and broke the fastening and needed it right into the loaf
Then she put the loaf in the pan and set it in the oven
The tramp hadent seen her do it and then he asked for something to eat
Granma got him up a meal and when hed et it he began prowling about the kitchen looking into everything and opening the cubbord doors
Then he went into granmas mas room and turned the buro drawers and trunk inside out and threw the things in them all about
All he found was a purse with a dollar in it and he swore about it and took it and went away
When granma was sure he was really gone she broke down and cried
She forgot all about the bread and it burned as black as coal
When she smelled it burning granma run and pulled it out
She was awful scared the locket was spoiled but she sawed open the loaf and it was there safe and sound
When her Aunt Hannah came back she said granma deserved the locket because she had saved it so clever and she gave it to her and grandma always wore it and was very proud of it
And granma used to say that was the only loaf of bread she ever spoiled in her life
PETER CRAIG
FELICITY Those stories are all very well but they are only true stories
Its easy enough to write true stories
I thought Peter was appointed fiction editor but he has never written any fiction since the paper started
Thats not MY idea of a fiction editor
He ought to make up stories out of his own head
PETER SPUNKILY I can do it too and I will next time
And it aint easier to write true stories
Its harder cause you have to stick to facts
FELICITY I dont believe you could make up a story
PETER Ill show you
MY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE Its my turn to write it but Im SO NERVOUS
My worst adventure happened TWO YEARS AGO
It was an awful one
I had a striped ribbon striped brown and yellow and I LOST IT
I was very sorry for it was a handsome ribbon and all the girls in school were jealous of it
FELICITY I wasnt
I didnt think it one bit pretty
CECILY Hush
I hunted everywhere but I couldnt find it
Next day was Sunday and I was running into the house by the front door and I saw SOMETHING LYING ON THE STEP and I thought it was my ribbon and I made a grab at it as I passed
But oh it was A SNAKE
Oh I can never describe how I felt when I felt that awful thing WRIGGLING IN MY HAND
I let it go and SCREAMED AND SCREAMED and ma was cross at me for yelling on Sunday and made me read seven chapters in the Bible but I didnt mind that much after what I had come through
I would rather DIE than have SUCH AN EXPERIENCE again
SARA RAY
TO FELICITY ON HER BERTHDAY Oh maiden fair with golden hair And brow of purest white Id fight for you Id die for you Let me be your faithful knite
This is your berthday blessed day You are thirteen years old today May you be happy and fair as you are now Until your hair is gray
I gaze into your shining eyes They are so blue and bright
Id fight for you Id die for you Let me be your faithful knite
A FRIEND
DAN Great snakes who got that up
Ill bet it was Peter
FELICITY WITH DIGNITY Well its more than YOU could do
YOU couldnt write poetry to save your life
PETER ASIDE TO BEVERLEY She seems quite pleased
Im glad I wrote it but it was awful hard work
PERSONALS Patrick Grayfur Esq caused his friends great anxiety recently by a prolonged absence from home
When found he was very thin but is now as fat and conceited as ever
On Wednesday June 20th Miss Olivia King was united in the bonds of holy matrimony to Dr Robert Seton of Halifax
Miss Sara Stanley was bridesmaid and Mr Andrew Seton attended the groom
The young couple received many handsome presents
Rev
Mr Marwood tied the nuptial knot
After the ceremony a substantial repast was served in Mrs Alex Kings wellknown style and the happy couple left for their new home in Nova Scotia
Their many friends join in wishing them a very happy and prosperous journey through life
A precious one from us is gone A voice we loved is stilled
A place is vacant in our home That never can be filled
THE STORY GIRL Goodness that sounds as if somebody had died
Ive seen that verse on a tombstone
WHO wrote that notice
FELICITY WHO WROTE IT I think it is just as appropriate to a wedding as to a funeral
Our school concert came off on the evening of June 29th and was a great success
We made ten dollars for the library

FELICITY LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY
Mr Newton Craig of Markdale returned home recently after a somewhat prolonged visit in foreign parts
We are glad to welcome Mr Craig back to our midst
Billy Robinson was hurt last week
A cow kicked him
I suppose it is wicked of us to feel glad but we all do feel glad because of the way he cheated us with the magic seed last summer
On April 1st Uncle Roger sent Mr Peter Craig to the manse to borrow the biography of Adams grandfather
Mr Marwood told Peter he didnt think Adam had any grandfather and advised him to go home and look at the almanac
PETER SOURLY Your Uncle Roger thought he was pretty smart
FELICITY SEVERELY Uncle Roger IS smart
It was so easy to fool you
A pair of blue birds have built a nest in a hole in the sides of the well just under the ferns
We can see the eggs when we look down
They are so cunning
Felix sat down on a tack one day in May
Felix thinks house cleaning is great foolishness

Its about Mr Samuel Clask again
He was once leading a prayer meeting and he looked through the window and saw the constable driving up and guessed he was after him because he was always in debt
So in a great hurry he called on Brother Casey to lead in prayer and while Brother Casey was praying with his eyes shut and everybody else had their heads bowed Mr Clask got out of the window and got away before the constable got in because he didnt like to come in till the prayer was finished
Uncle Roger says it was a smart trick on Mr Clasks part but I dont think there was much religion about it

CHAPTER XXI PEG BOWEN COMES TO CHURCH When those of us who are still left of that band of children who played long years ago in the old orchard and walked the golden road together in joyous companionship foregather now and again in our busy lives and talk over the events of those many merry moons there are some of our adventures that gleam out more vividly in memory than the others and are oftener discussed
The time we bought Gods picture from Jerry Cowanthe time Dan ate the poison berriesthe time we heard the ghostly bell ringthe bewitchment of Paddythe visit of the Governors wifeand the night we were lost in the stormall awaken reminiscent jest and laughter but none more than the recollection of the Sunday Peg Bowen came to church and sat in our pew
Though goodness knows as Felicity would say we did not think it any matter for laughter at the timefar from it
It was one Sunday evening in July
Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet having been out to the morning service did not attend in the evening and we small fry walked together down the long hill road wearing Sunday attire and trying more or less successfully to wear Sunday faces also
Those walks to church through the golden completeness of the summer evenings were always very pleasant to us and we never hurried though on the other hand we were very careful not to be late
This particular evening was particularly beautiful
It was cool after a hot day and wheat fields all about us were ripening to their harvestry
The wind gossiped with the grasses along our way and over them the buttercups danced goldenlyglad
Waves of sinuous shadow went over the ripe hayfields and plundering bees sang a freebooting lilt in wayside gardens
The world is so lovely tonight said the Story Girl
I just hate the thought of going into the church and shutting all the sunlight and music outside
I wish we could have the service outside in summer
I dont think that would be very religious said Felicity
Id feel ever so much more religious outside than in retorted the Story Girl
If the service was outside wed have to sit in the graveyard and that wouldnt be very cheerful said Felix
Besides the music isnt shut out added Felicity
The choir is inside
Music has charms to soothe a savage breast quoted Peter who was getting into the habit of adorning his conversation with similar gems
Thats in one of Shakespeares plays
Im reading them now since I got through with the Bible
Theyre great
I dont see when you get time to read them said Felicity
Oh I read them Sunday afternoons when Im home
I dont believe theyre fit to read on Sundays exclaimed Felicity
Mother says Valeria Montagues stories aint
But Shakespeares different from Valeria protested Peter
I dont see in what way
He wrote a lot of things that werent true just like Valeria and he wrote swear words too
Valeria never does that
Her characters all talk in a very refined fashion
Well I always skip the swear words said Peter
And Mr Marwood said once that the Bible and Shakespeare would furnish any library well
So you see he put them together but Im sure that he would never say that the Bible and Valeria would make a library
Well all I know is I shall never read Shakespeare on Sunday said Felicity loftily
I wonder what kind of a preacher young Mr Davidson is speculated Cecily
Well well know when we hear him tonight said the Story Girl
He ought to be good for his uncle before him was a fine preacher though a very absentminded man
But Uncle Roger says the supply in Mr Marwoods vacation never amounts to much
I know an awfully funny story about old Mr Davidson
He used to be the minister in Baywater you know and he had a large family and his children were very mischievous
One day his wife was ironing and she ironed a great big nightcap with a frill round it
One of the children took it when she wasnt looking and hid it in his fathers best beaver hatthe one he wore on Sundays
When Mr Davidson went to church next Sunday he put the hat on without ever looking into the crown
He walked to church in a brown study and at the door he took off his hat
The nightcap just slipped down on his head as if it had been put on and the frill stood out around his face and the string hung down his back
But he never noticed it because his thoughts were far away and he walked up the church aisle and into the pulpit like that
One of his elders had to tiptoe up and tell him what he had on his head
He plucked it off in a dazed fashion held it up and looked at it
Bless me it is Sallys nightcap
he exclaimed mildly
I do not know how I could have got it on
Then he just stuffed it into his pocket calmly and went on with the service and the long strings of the nightcap hung down out of his pocket all the time
It seems to me said Peter amid the laughter with which we greeted the tale that a funny story is funnier when it is about a minister than it is about any other man
I wonder why
Sometimes I dont think it is right to tell funny stories about ministers said Felicity
It certainly isnt respectful
A good story is a good storyno matter who its about said the Story Girl with ungrammatical relish
There was as yet no one in the church when we reached it so we took our accustomed ramble through the graveyard surrounding it
The Story Girl had brought flowers for her mothers grave as usual and while she arranged them on it the rest of us read for the hundredth time the epitaph on GreatGrandfather Kings tombstone which had been composed by GreatGrandmother King
That epitaph was quite famous among the little family traditions that entwine every household with mingled mirth and sorrow smiles and tears
It had a perennial fascination for us and we read it over every Sunday
Cut deeply in the upright slab of red Island sandstone the epitaph ran as follows SWEET DEPARTED SPIRIT Do receive the vows a grateful widow pays Each future day and night shall hear her speak her Isaacs praise
Though thy beloved form must in the grave decay Yet from her heart thy memory no time no change shall steal away
Do thou from mansions of eternal bliss Remember thy distressed relict
Look on her with an angels love Soothe her sad life and cheer her end Through this worlds dangers and its griefs
Then meet her with thy wellknown smiles and welcome At the last great day
Well I cant make out what the old lady was driving at said Dan
Thats a nice way to speak of your greatgrandmother said Felicity severely
How does The Family Guide say you ought to speak of your great grandma sweet one
asked Dan
There is one thing about it that puzzles me remarked Cecily
She calls herself a GRATEFUL widow
Now what was she grateful for
Because she was rid of him at last said graceless Dan
Oh it couldnt have been that protested Cecily seriously
Ive always heard that GreatGrandfather and GreatGrandmother were very much attached to each other
Maybe then it means she was grateful that shed had him as long as she did suggested Peter
She was grateful to him because he had been so kind to her in life I think said Felicity
What is a distressed relict
asked Felix
Relict is a word I hate said the Story Girl
It sounds so much like relic
Relict means just the same as widow only a man can be a relict too
GreatGrandmother seemed to run short of rhymes at the last of the epitaph commented Dan
Finding rhymes isnt as easy as you might think avowed Peter out of his own experience
I think Grandmother King intended the last of the epitaph to be in blank verse said Felicity with dignity
There was still only a sprinkling of people in the church when we went in and took our places in the oldfashioned square King pew
We had just got comfortably settled when Felicity said in an agitated whisper Here is Peg Bowen
We all stared at Peg who was pacing composedly up the aisle
We might be excused for so doing for seldom were the decorous aisles of Carlisle church invaded by such a figure
Peg was dressed in her usual short drugget skirt rather worn and frayed around the bottom and a waist of brilliant turkey red calico
She wore no hat and her grizzled black hair streamed in elf locks over her shoulders
Face arms and feet were bareand face arms and feet were liberally powdered with FLOUR
Certainly no one who saw Peg that night could ever forget the apparition
Pegs black eyes in which shone a more than usually wild and fitful light roved scrutinizingly over the church then settled on our pew
Shes coming here whispered Felicity in horror
Cant we spread out and make her think the pew is full
But the manoeuvre was too late
The only result was that Felicity and the Story Girl in moving over left a vacant space between them and Peg promptly plumped down in it
Well Im here she remarked aloud
I did say once Id never darken the door of Carlisle church again but what that boy therenodding at Petersaid last winter set me thinking and I concluded maybe Id better come once in a while to be on the safe side
Those poor girls were in an agony
Everybody in the church was looking at our pew and smiling
We all felt that we were terribly disgraced but we could do nothing
Peg was enjoying herself hugely beyond all doubt
From where she sat she could see the whole church including pulpit and gallery and her black eyes darted over it with restless glances
Bless me theres Sam Kinnaird she exclaimed still aloud
Hes the man that dunned Jacob Marr for four cents on the church steps one Sunday
I heard him
I think Jacob you owe me four cents on that cow you bought last fall
Recllect you couldnt make the change
Well you know twould amade a cat laugh
The Kinnairds were all mighty close I can tell you
Thats how they got rich
What Sam Kinnaird felt or thought during this speech which everyone in the church must have heard I know not
Gossip had it that he changed colour
We wretched occupants of the King pew were concerned only with our own outraged feelings
And theres Melita Ross went on Peg
Shes got the same bonnet on she had last time I was in Carlisle church six years ago
Some folks has the knack of making things last
But look at the style Mrs Elmer Brewer wears will yez
Yez wouldnt think her mother died in the poorhouse would yez now
Poor Mrs
Brewer
From the tip of her smart kid shoes to the dainty cluster of ostrich tips in her bonnetshe was most immaculately and handsomely arrayed but I venture to think she could have taken small pleasure in her fashionable attire that evening
Some of the unregenerate including Dan were shaking with suppressed laughter but most of the people looked as if they were afraid to smile lest their turn should come next
Theres old Stephen Grant coming in exclaimed Peg viciously shaking her floury fist at him and looking as if butter wouldnt melt in his mouth
He may be an elder but hes a scoundrel just the same
He set fire to his house to get the insurance and then blamed ME for doing it
But I got even with him for it
Oh yes
He knows that and so do I
He he
Peg chuckled quite fiendishly and Stephen Grant tried to look as if nothing had been said
Oh will the minister never come
moaned Felicity in my ear
Surely shell have to stop then
But the minister did not come and Peg had no intention of stopping
Theres Maria Dean
she resumed
I havent seen Maria for years
I never call there for she never seems to have anything to eat in the house
She was a Clayton and the Claytons never could cook
Maria sorter looks as if shed shrunk in the wash now dont she
And theres Douglas Nicholson
His brother put rat poison in the family pancakes
Nice little trick that wasnt it
They say it was by mistake
I hope it WAS a mistake
His wife is all rigged out in silk
Yez wouldnt think to look at her she was married in cottonand mighty thankful to get married in anything its my opinion
Theres Timothy Patterson
Hes the meanest man alivemeanern Sam Kinnaird even
Timothy pays his children five cents apiece to go without their suppers and then steals the cents out of their pockets after theyve gone to bed
Its a fact
And when his old father died he wouldnt let his wife put his best shirt on him
He said his second best was plenty good to be buried in
Thats another fact
I cant stand much more of this wailed Felicity
See here Miss Bowen you really oughtnt to talk like that about people expostulated Peter in a low tone goaded thereto despite his awe of Peg by Felicitys anguish
Bless you boy said Peg goodhumouredly the only difference between me and other folks is that I say these things out loud and they just think them
If I told yez all the things I know about the people in this congregation youd be amazed
Have a peppermint
To our horror Peg produced a handful of peppermint lozenges from the pocket of her skirt and offered us one each
We did not dare refuse but we each held our lozenge very gingerly in our hands
Eat them commanded Peg rather fiercely
Mother doesnt allow us to eat candy in church faltered Felicity
Well Ive seen just as fine ladies as your ma give their children lozenges in church said Peg loftily
She put a peppermint in her own mouth and sucked it with gusto
We were relieved for she did not talk during the process but our relief was of short duration
A bevy of three very smartly dressed young ladies sweeping past our pew started Peg off again
Yez neednt be so stuck up she said loudly and derisively
Yez was all of yez rocked in a flour barrel
And theres old Henry Frewen still above ground
I called my parrot after him because their noses were exactly alike
Look at Caroline Marr will yez
Thats a woman whod like pretty well to get married And theres Alexander Marr
Hes a real Christian anyhow and sos his dog
I can always size up what a mans religion amounts to by the kind of dog he keeps
Alexander Marr is a good man
It was a relief to hear Peg speak well of somebody but that was the only exception she made
Look at Dave Fraser strutting in she went on
That man has thanked God so often that he isnt like other people that its come to be true
He isnt
And theres Susan Frewen
Shes jealous of everybody
Shes even jealous of Old Man Rogers because hes buried in the best spot in the graveyard
Seth Erskine has the same look he was born with
They say the Lord made everybody but I believe the devil made all the Erskines
Shes getting worse all the time
What WILL she say next
whispered poor Felicity
But her martyrdom was over at last
The minister appeared in the pulpit and Peg subsided into silence
She folded her bare floury arms over her breast and fastened her black eyes on the young preacher
Her behaviour for the next halfhour was decorum itself save that when the minister prayed that we might all be charitable in judgment Peg ejaculated Amen several times loudly and forcibly somewhat to the discomfiture of the Young man to whom Peg was a stranger
He opened his eyes glanced at our pew in a startled way then collected himself and went on
Peg listened to the sermon silently and motionlessly until Mr Davidson was half through
Then she suddenly got on her feet
This is too dull for me she exclaimed
I want something more exciting
Mr Davidson stopped short and Peg marched down the aisle in the midst of complete silence
Half way down the aisle she turned around and faced the minister
There are so many hypocrites in this church that it isnt fit for decent people to come to she said
Rather than be such hypocrites as most of you are it would be better for you to go miles into the woods and commit suicide
Wheeling about she strode to the door
Then she turned for a Parthian shot
Ive felt kind of worried for God sometimes seeing He has so much to attend to she said but I see I neednt be so longs theres plenty of ministers to tell Him what to do
With that Peg shook the dust of Carlisle church from her feet
Poor Mr Davidson resumed his discourse
Old Elder Bayley whose attention an earthquake could not have distracted from the sermon afterwards declared that it was an excellent and edifying exhortation but I doubt if anyone else in Carlisle church tasted it much or gained much good therefrom
Certainly we of the King household did not
We could not even remember the text when we reached home
Felicity was comfortless
Mr Davidson would be sure to think she belonged to our family when she was in our pew she said bitterly
Oh I feel as if I could never get over such a mortification
Peter I do wish you wouldnt go telling people they ought to go to church
Its all your fault that this happened
Never mind it will be a good story to tell sometime remarked the Story Girl with relish
CHAPTER XXII THE YANKEE STORM In an August orchard six children and a grownup were sitting around the pulpit stone
The grownup was Miss Reade who had been up to give the girls their music lesson and had consented to stay to tea much to the rapture of the said girls who continued to worship her with unabated and romantic ardour
To us over the golden grasses came the Story Girl carrying in her hand a single large poppy like a bloodred chalice filled with the wine of August wizardry
She proffered it to Miss Reade and as the latter took it into her singularly slender beautiful hand I saw a ring on her third finger
I noticed it because I had heard the girls say that Miss Reade never wore rings not liking them
It was not a new ring it was handsome but of an oldfashioned design and setting with a glint of diamonds about a central sapphire
Later on when Miss Reade had gone I asked the Story Girl if she had noticed the ring
She nodded but seemed disinclined to say more about it
Look here Sara I said theres something about that ring something you know
I told you once there was a story growing but you would have to wait until it was fully grown she answered
Is Miss Reade going to marry anybodyanybody we know
I persisted
Curiosity killed a cat observed the Story Girl coolly
Miss Reade hasnt told me that she was going to marry anybody
You will find out all that is good for you to know in due time
When the Story Girl put on grownup airs I did not like her so well and I dropped the subject with a dignity that seemed to amuse her mightily
She had been away for a week visiting cousins in Markdale and she had come home with a new treasuretrove of stories most of which she had heard from the old sailors of Markdale Harbour
She had promised that morning to tell us of the most tragic event that had ever been known on the north shore and we now reminded her of her promise
Some call it the Yankee Storm and others the American Gale she began sitting down by Miss Reade and beaming because the latter put her arm around her waist
It happened nearly forty years ago in October of 1851
Old Mr Coles at the Harbour told me all about it
He was a young man then and he says he can never forget that dreadful time
You know in those days hundreds of American fishing schooners used to come down to the Gulf every summer to fish mackerel
On one beautiful Saturday night in this October of 1851 more than one hundred of these vessels could be counted from Markdale Capes
By Monday night more than seventy of them had been destroyed
Those which had escaped were mostly those which went into harbour Saturday night to keep Sunday
Mr Coles says the rest stayed outside and fished all day Sunday same as through the week and HE says the storm was a judgment on them for doing it
But he admits that even some of them got into harbour later on and escaped so its hard to know what to think
But it is certain that on Sunday night there came up a sudden and terrible stormthe worst Mr Coles says that has ever been known on the north shore
It lasted for two days and scores of vessels were driven ashore and completely wrecked
The crews of most of the vessels that went ashore on the sand beaches were saved but those that struck on the rocks went to pieces and all hands were lost
For weeks after the storm the north shore was strewn with the bodies of drowned men
Think of it
Many of them were unknown and unrecognizable and they were buried in Markdale graveyard
Mr Coles says the schoolmaster who was in Markdale then wrote a poem on the storm and Mr Coles recited the first two verses to me
Here are the fishers hillside graves The church beside the woods around Below the hollow moaning waves Where the poor fishermen were drowned
A sudden tempest the blue welkin tore The seamen tossed and torn apart Rolled with the seaweed to the shore While landsmen gazed with aching heart
Mr Coles couldnt remember any more of it
But the saddest of all the stories of the Yankee Storm was the one about the Franklin Dexter
The Franklin Dexter went ashore on the Markdale Capes and all on board perished the Captain and three of his brothers among them
These four young men were the sons of an old man who lived in Portland Maine and when he heard what had happened he came right down to the Island to see if he could find their bodies
They had all come ashore and had been buried in Markdale graveyard but he was determined to take them up and carry them home for burial
He said he had promised their mother to take her boys home to her and he must do it
So they were taken up and put on board a sailing vessel at Markdale Harbour to be taken back to Maine while the father himself went home on a passenger steamer
The name of the sailing vessel was the Seth Hall and the captains name was Seth Hall too
Captain Hall was a dreadfully profane man and used to swear bloodcurdling oaths
On the night he sailed out of Markdale Harbour the old sailors warned him that a storm was brewing and that it would catch him if he did not wait until it was over
The captain had become very impatient because of several delays he had already met with and he was in a furious temper
He swore a wicked oath that he would sail out of Markdale Harbour that night and God Almighty Himself shouldnt catch him
He did sail out of the harbour and the storm did catch him and the Seth Hall went down with all hands the dead and the living finding a watery grave together
So the poor old mother up in Maine never had her boys brought back to her after all
Mr Coles says it seems as if it were foreordained that they should not rest in a grave but should lie beneath the waves until the day when the sea gives up its dead
They sleep as well beneath that purple tide As others under turf quoted Miss Reade softly
I am very thankful she added
that I am not one of those whose dear ones go down to the sea in ships
It seems to me that they have treble their share of this worlds heartache
Uncle Stephen was a sailor and he was drowned said Felicity and they say it broke Grandmother Kings heart
I dont see why people cant be contented on dry land
Cecilys tears had been dropping on the autograph quilt square she was faithfully embroidering
She had been diligently collecting names for it ever since the preceding autumn and had a goodly number but Kitty Marr had one more and this was certainly a fly in Cecilys ointment
Besides one Ive got isnt paid forPeg Bowens she lamented and I dont suppose it ever will be for Ill never dare to ask her for it
I wouldnt put it on at all said Felicity
Oh I dont dare not to
Shed be sure to find out I didnt and then shed be very angry
I wish I could get just one more name and then Id be contented
But I dont know of a single person who hasnt been asked already
Except Mr Campbell said Dan
Oh of course nobody would ask Mr Campbell
We all know it would be of no use
He doesnt believe in missions at allin fact he says he detests the very mention of missionsand he never gives one cent to them
All the same I think he ought to be asked so that he wouldnt have the excuse that nobody DID ask him declared Dan
Do you really think so Dan
asked Cecily earnestly
Sure said Dan solemnly
Dan liked to tease even Cecily a wee bit now and then
Cecily relapsed into anxious thought and care sat visibly on her brow for the rest of the day
Next morning she came to me and said Bev would you like to go for a walk with me this afternoon
Of course I replied
Any particular where
Im going to see Mr Campbell and ask him for his name for my square said Cecily resolutely
I dont suppose it will do any good
He wouldnt give anything to the library last summer you remember till the Story Girl told him that story about his grandmother
She wont go with me this timeI dont know why
I cant tell a story and Im frightened to death just to think of going to him
But I believe it is my duty and besides I would love to get as many names on my square as Kitty Marr has
So if youll go with me well go this afternoon
I simply COULDNT go alone
CHAPTER XXIII A MISSIONARY HEROINE Accordingly that afternoon we bearded the lion in his den
The road we took was a beautiful one for we went cross lots and we enjoyed it in spite of the fact that we did not expect the interview with Mr Campbell to be a very pleasant one
To be sure he had been quite civil on the occasion of our last call upon him but the Story Girl had been with us then and had beguiled him into goodhumour and generosity by the magic of her voice and personality
We had no such ally now and Mr Campbell was known to be virulently opposed to missions in any shape or form
I dont know whether it would have been any better if I could have put on my good clothes said Cecily with a rueful glance at her print dress which though neat and clean was undeniably faded and RATHER short and tight
The Story Girl said it would and I wanted to but mother wouldnt let me
She said it was all nonsense and Mr Campbell would never notice what I had on
Its my opinion that Mr Campbell notices a good deal more than youd think for I said sagely
Well I wish our call was over sighed Cecily
I cant tell you how I dread it
Now see here Sis I said cheerfully lets not think about it till we get there
Itll only spoil our walk and do no good
Lets just forget it and enjoy ourselves
Ill try agreed Cecily but its ever so much easier to preach than to practise
Our way lay first over a hill top gallantly plumed with golden rod where cloud shadows drifted over us like a gypsying crew
Carlisle in all its ripely tinted length and breadth lay below us basking in the August sunshine that spilled over the brim of the valley to the faroff Markdale Harbour cupped in its harvest golden hills
Then came a little valley overgrown with the pale purple bloom of thistles and elusively haunted with their perfume
You say that thistles have no perfume
Go you to a brook hollow where they grow some late summer twilight at dewfall and on the still air that rises suddenly to meet you will come a waft of faint aromatic fragrance wondrously sweet and evasive the distillation of that despised thistle bloom
Beyond this the path wound through a forest of fir where a wood wind wove its murmurous spell and a wood brook dimpled pellucidly among the shadowsthe dear companionable elfin shadowsthat lurked under the low growing boughs
Along the edges of that winding path grew banks of velvet green moss starred with clusters of pigeon berries
Pigeon berries are not to be eaten
They are woolly tasteless things
But they are to be looked at in their glowing scarlet
They are the jewels with which the forest of conebearers loves to deck its brown breast
Cecily gathered some and pinned them on hers but they did not become her
I thought how witching the Story Girls brown curls would have looked twined with those brilliant clusters
Perhaps Cecily was thinking of it too for she presently said Bev dont you think the Story Girl is changing somehow
There are timesjust timeswhen she seems to belong more among the grownups than among us I said reluctantly especially when she puts on her bridesmaid dress
Well shes the oldest of us and when you come to think of it shes fifteenthats almost grownup sighed Cecily
Then she added with sudden vehemence I hate the thought of any of us growing up
Felicity says she just longs to be grownup but I dont not a bit
I wish I could just stay a little girl for everand have you and Felix and all the others for playmates right along
I dont know how it isbut whenever I think of being grownup I seem to feel tired
Something about Cecilys speechor the wistful look that had crept into her sweet brown eyesmade me feel vaguely uncomfortable I was glad that we were at the end of our journey with Mr Campbells big house before us and his dog sitting gravely at the veranda steps
Oh dear said Cecily with a shiver Id been hoping that dog wouldnt be around
He never bites I assured her
Perhaps he doesnt but he always looks as if he was going to rejoined Cecily
The dog continued to look and as we edged gingerly past him and up the veranda steps he turned his head and kept on looking
What with Mr Campbell before us and the dog behind Cecily was trembling with nervousness but perhaps it was as well that the dour brute was there else I verily believe she would have turned and fled shamelessly when we heard steps in the hall
It was Mr Campbells housekeeper who came to the door however she ushered us pleasantly into the sittingroom where Mr Campbell was reading
He laid down his book with a slight frown and said nothing at all in response to our timid good afternoon
But after we had sat for a few minutes in wretched silence wishing ourselves a thousand miles away he said with a chuckle Well is it the school library again
Cecily had remarked as we were coming that what she dreaded most of all was introducing the subject but Mr Campbell had given her a splendid opening and she plunged wildly in at once rattling her explanation off nervously with trembling voice and flushed cheeks
No its our Mission Band autograph quilt Mr Campbell
There are to be as many squares in it as there are members in the Band
Each one has a square and is collecting names for it
If you want to have your name on the quilt you pay five cents and if you want to have it right in the round spot in the middle of the square you must pay ten cents
Then when we have got all the names we can we will embroider them on the squares
The money is to go to the little girl our Band is supporting in Korea
I heard that nobody had asked you so I thought perhaps you would give me your name for my square
Mr Campbell drew his black brows together in a scowl
Stuff and nonsense
he exclaimed angrily
I dont believe in Foreign Missionsdont believe in them at all
I never give a cent to them
Five cents isnt a very large sum said Cecily earnestly
Mr Campbells scowl disappeared and he laughed
It wouldnt break me he admitted but its the principle of the thing
And as for that Mission Band of yours if it wasnt for the fun you get out of it catch one of you belonging
You dont really care a rap more for the heathen than I do
Oh we do protested Cecily
We do think of all the poor little children in Korea and we like to think we are helping them if its ever so little
We ARE in earnest Mr Campbell indeed we are
Dont believe itdont believe a word of it said Mr Campbell impolitely
Youll do things that are nice and interesting
Youll get up concerts and chase people about for autographs and give money your parents give you and that doesnt cost you either time or labour
But you wouldnt do anything you disliked for the heathen childrenyou wouldnt make any real sacrifice for them catch you
Indeed we would cried Cecily forgetting her timidity in her zeal
I just wish I had a chance to prove it to you
You do eh
Come now Ill take you at your word
Ill test you
Tomorrow is Communion Sunday and the church will be full of folks and theyll all have their best clothes on
If you go to church tomorrow in the very costume you have on at present without telling anyone why you do so until it is all over Ill give youwhy I vow Ill give you five dollars for that quilt of yours
Poor Cecily
To go to church in a faded print dress with a shabby little old sunhat and worn shoes
It was very cruel of Mr Campbell
II dont think mother would let me she faltered
Her tormentor smiled grimly
Its not hard to find some excuse he said sarcastically
Cecily crimsoned and sat up facing Mr Campbell spunkily
Its NOT an excuse she said
If mother will let me go to church like this Ill go
But Ill have to tell HER why Mr Campbell because Im certain shed never let me if I didnt
Oh you can tell all your own family said Mr Campbell but remember none of them must tell it outside until Sunday is over
If they do Ill be sure to find it out and then our bargain is off
If I see you in church tomorrow dressed as you are now Ill give you my name and five dollars
But I wont see you
Youll shrink when youve had time to think it over
I shant said Cecily resolutely
Well well see
And now come out to the barn with me
Ive got the prettiest little drove of calves out there you ever saw
I want you to see them
Mr Campbell took us all over his barns and was very affable
He had beautiful horses cows and sheep and I enjoyed seeing them
I dont think Cecily did however
She was very quiet and even Mr Campbells handsome new span of dappled grays failed to arouse any enthusiasm in her
She was already in bitter anticipation living over the martyrdom of the morrow
On the way home she asked me seriously if I thought Mr Campbell would go to heaven when he died
Of course he will I said
Isnt he a member of the church
Oh yes but I cant imagine him fitting into heaven
You know he isnt really fond of anything but live stock
Hes fond of teasing people I guess I responded
Are you really going to church tomorrow in that dress Sis
If motherll let me Ill have to said poor Cecily
I wont let Mr Campbell triumph over me
And I DO want to have as many names as Kitty has
And I DO want to help the poor little Korean children
But it will be simply dreadful
I dont know whether I hope mother will or not
I did not believe she would but Aunt Janet sometimes could be depended on for the unexpected
She laughed and told Cecily she could please herself
Felicity was in a rage over it and declared SHE wouldnt go to church if Cecily went in such a rig
Dan sarcastically inquired if all she went to church for was to show off her fine clothes and look at other peoples then they quarrelled and didnt speak to each other for two days much to Cecilys distress
I suspect poor Sis wished devoutly that it might rain the next day but it was gloriously fine
We were all waiting in the orchard for the Story Girl who had not begun to dress for church until Cecily and Felicity were ready
Felicity was her prettiest in flowertrimmed hat crisp muslin floating ribbons and trim black slippers
Poor Cecily stood beside her mute and pale in her faded school garb and heavy coppertoed boots
But her face if pale was very determined
Cecily having put her hand to the plough was not of those who turn back
You do look just awful said Felicity
I dont careIm going to sit in Uncle James pew
I WONT sit with you
There will be so many strangers there and all the Markdale people and what will they think of you
Some of them will never know the reason either
I wish the Story Girl would hurry was all poor Cecily said
Were going to be late
It wouldnt have been quite so hard if I could have got there before anyone and slipped quietly into our pew
Here she comes at last said Dan
Whywhats she got on
The Story Girl joined us with a quizzical smile on her face
Dan whistled
Cecilys pale cheeks flushed with understanding and gratitude
The Story Girl wore her school print dress and hat also and was gloveless and heavy shod
Youre not going to have to go through this all alone Cecily she said
Oh it wont be half so hard now said Cecily with a long breath of relief
I fancy it was hard enough even then
The Story Girl did not care a whit but Cecily rather squirmed under the curious glances that were cast at her
She afterwards told me that she really did not think she could have endured it if she had been alone
Mr Campbell met us under the elms in the churchyard with a twinkle in his eye
Well you did it Miss he said to Cecily but you should have been alone
That was what I meant
I suppose you think youve cheated me nicely
No she doesnt spoke up the Story Girl undauntedly
She was all dressed and ready to come before she knew I was going to dress the same way
So she kept her bargain faithfully Mr Campbell and I think you were cruel to make her do it
You do eh
Well well I hope youll forgive me
I didnt think shed do itI was sure feminine vanity would win the day over missionary zeal
It seems it didntthough how much was pure missionary zeal and how much just plain King spunk Im doubtful
Ill keep my promise Miss
You shall have your five dollars and mind you put my name in the round space
No five cent corners for me
CHAPTER XXIV A TANTALIZING REVELATION I shall have something to tell you in the orchard this evening said the Story Girl at breakfast one morning
Her eyes were very bright and excited
She looked as if she had not slept a great deal
She had spent the previous evening with Miss Reade and had not returned until the rest of us were in bed
Miss Reade had finished giving music lessons and was going home in a few days
Cecily and Felicity were in despair over this and mourned as those without comfort
But the Story Girl who had been even more devoted to Miss Reade than either of them had not as I noticed expressed any regret and seemed to be very cheerful over the whole matter
Why cant you tell it now
asked Felicity
Because the evening is the nicest time to tell things in
I only mentioned it now so that you would have something interesting to look forward to all day
Is it about Miss Reade
asked Cecily
Never mind
Ill bet shes going to be married I exclaimed remembering the ring
Is she
cried Felicity and Cecily together
The Story Girl threw an annoyed glance at me
She did not like to have her dramatic announcements forestalled
I dont say that it is about Miss Reade or that it isnt
You must just wait till the evening
I wonder what it is speculated Cecily as the Story Girl left the room
I dont believe its much of anything said Felicity beginning to clear away the breakfast dishes
The Story Girl always likes to make so much out of so little
Anyhow I dont believe Miss Reade is going to be married
She hasnt any beaus around here and Mrs Armstrong says shes sure she doesnt correspond with anybody
Besides if she was she wouldnt be likely to tell the Story Girl
Oh she might
Theyre such friends you know said Cecily
Miss Reade is no better friends with her than she is with me and you retorted Felicity
No but sometimes it seems to me that shes a different kind of friend with the Story Girl than she is with me and you reflected Cecily
I cant just explain what I mean
No wonder
Such nonsense sniffed Felicity
Its only some girls secret anyway said Dan loftily
I dont feel much interest in it
But he was on hand with the rest of us that evening interest or no interest in Uncle Stephens Walk where the ripening apples were beginning to glow like jewels among the boughs
Now are you going to tell us your news
asked Felicity impatiently
Miss Reade IS going to be married said the Story Girl
She told me so last night
She is going to be married in a fortnights time
Who to
exclaimed the girls
Tothe Story Girl threw a defiant glance at me as if to say You cant spoil the surprise of THIS anywaytothe Awkward Man
For a few moments amazement literally held us dumb
Youre not in earnest Sara Stanley
gasped Felicity at last
Indeed I am
I thought youd be astonished
But I wasnt
Ive suspected it all summer from little things Ive noticed
Dont you remember that evening last spring when I went a piece with Miss Reade and told you when I came back that a story was growing
I guessed it from the way the Awkward Man looked at her when I stopped to speak to him over his garden fence
Butthe Awkward Man
said Felicity helplessly
It doesnt seem possible
Did Miss Reade tell you HERSELF
Yes
I suppose it must be true then
But how did it ever come about
Hes SO shy and awkward
How did he ever manage to get up enough spunk to ask her to marry him
Maybe she asked him suggested Dan
The Story Girl looked as if she might tell if she would
I believe that WAS the way of it I said to draw her on
Not exactly she said reluctantly
I know all about it but I cant tell you
I guessed part from things Ive seenand Miss Reade told me a good dealand the Awkward Man himself told me his side of it as we came home last night
I met him just as I left Mr Armstrongs and we were together as far as his house
It was dark and he just talked on as if he were talking to himselfI think he forgot I was there at all once he got started
He has never been shy or awkward with me but he never talked as he did last night
You might tell us what he said urged Cecily
Wed never tell
The Story Girl shook her head
No I cant
You wouldnt understand
Besides I couldnt tell it just right
Its one of the things that are hardest to tell
Id spoil it if I told itnow
Perhaps some day Ill be able to tell it properly
Its very beautifulbut it might sound very ridiculous if it wasnt told just exactly the right way
I dont know what you mean and I dont believe you know yourself said Felicity pettishly
All that I can make out is that Miss Reade is going to marry Jasper Dale and I dont like the idea one bit
She is so beautiful and sweet
I thought shed marry some dashing young man
Jasper Dale must be nearly twenty years older than herand hes so queer and shyand such a hermit
Miss Reade is perfectly happy said the Story Girl
She thinks the Awkward Man is lovelyand so he is
You dont know him but I do
Well you neednt put on such airs about it sniffed Felicity
I am not putting on any airs
But its true
Miss Reade and I are the only people in Carlisle who really know the Awkward Man
Nobody else ever got behind his shyness to find out just what sort of a man he is
When are they to be married
asked Felicity
In a fortnights time
And then they are coming right back to live at Golden Milestone
Wont it be lovely to have Miss Reade always so near us
I wonder what shell think about the mystery of Golden Milestone remarked Felicity
Golden Milestone was the beautiful name the Awkward Man had given his home and there was a mystery about it as readers of the first volume of these chronicles will recall
She knows all about the mystery and thinks it perfectly lovely and so do I said the Story Girl
Do YOU know the secret of the locked room
cried Cecily
Yes the Awkward Man told me all about it last night
I told you Id find out the mystery some time
And what is it
I cant tell you that either
I think youre hateful and mean exclaimed Felicity
It hasnt anything to do with Miss Reade so I think you might tell us
It has something to do with Miss Reade
Its all about her
Well I dont see how that can be when the Awkward Man never saw or heard of Miss Reade until she came to Carlisle in the spring said Felicity incredulously and hes had that locked room for years
I cant explain it to youbut its just as Ive said responded the Story Girl
Well its a very queer thing retorted Felicity
The name in the books in the room was Aliceand Miss Reades name is Alice marvelled Cecily
Did he know her before she came here
Mrs Griggs says that room has been locked for ten years
Ten years ago Miss Reade was just a little girl of ten
SHE couldnt be the Alice of the books argued Felicity
I wonder if shell wear the blue silk dress said Sara Ray
And what will she do about the picture if it isnt hers
added Cecily
The picture couldnt be hers or Mrs Griggs would have known her for the same when she came to Carlisle said Felix
Im going to stop wondering about it exclaimed Felicity crossly aggravated by the amused smile with which the Story Girl was listening to the various speculations
I think Sara is just as mean as mean when she wont tell us
I cant repeated the Story Girl patiently
You said one time you had an idea who Alice was I said
Was your idea anything like the truth
Yes I guessed pretty nearly right
Do you suppose theyll keep the room locked after they are married
asked Cecily
Oh no
I can tell you that much
It is to be Miss Reades own particular sitting room
Why then perhaps well see it some time ourselves when we go to see Miss Reade cried Cecily
Id be frightened to go into it confessed Sara Ray
I hate things with mysteries
They always make me nervous
I love them
Theyre so exciting said the Story Girl
Just think this will be the second wedding of people we know reflected Cecily
Isnt that interesting
I only hope the next thing wont be a funeral remarked Sara Ray gloomily
There were three lighted lamps on our kitchen table last night and Judy Pineau says thats a sure sign of a funeral
Well there are funerals going on all the time said Dan
But it means the funeral of somebody you know
I dont believe in itMUCHbut Judy says shes seen it come true time and again
I hope if it does it wont be anybody we know very well
But I hope itll be somebody I know a LITTLE because then I might get to the funeral
Id just love to go to a funeral
Thats a dreadful thing to say commented Felicity in a shocked tone
Sara Ray looked bewildered
I dont see what is dreadful in it she protested
People dont go to funerals for the fun of it said Felicity severely
And you just as good as said you hoped somebody you knew would die so youd get to the funeral
No no I didnt
I didnt mean that AT ALL Felicity
I dont want anybody to die but what I meant was if anybody I knew HAD to die there might be a chance to go to the funeral
Ive never been to a single funeral yet and it must be so interesting
Well dont mix up talk about funerals with talk about weddings said Felicity
It isnt lucky
I think Miss Reade is simply throwing herself away but I hope shell be happy
And I hope the Awkward Man will manage to get married without making some awful blunder but its more than I expect
The ceremony is to be very private said the Story Girl
Id like to see them the day they appear out in church chuckled Dan
Howll he ever manage to bring her in and show her into the pew
Ill bet hell go in firstor tramp on her dressor fall over his feet
Maybe he wont go to church at all the first Sunday and shell have to go alone said Peter
That happened in Markdale
A man was too bashful to go to church the first time after getting married and his wife went alone till he got used to the idea
They may do things like that in Markdale but that is not the way people behave in Carlisle said Felicity loftily
Seeing the Story Girl slipping away with a disapproving face I joined her
What is the matter Sara
I asked
I hate to hear them talking like that about Miss Reade and Mr Dale she answered vehemently
Its really all so beautiful but they make it seem silly and absurd somehow
You might tell me all about it Sara I insinuated
I wouldnt telland Id understand
Yes I think you would she said thoughtfully
But I cant tell it even to you because I cant tell it well enough yet
Ive a feeling that theres only one way to tell itand I dont know the way yet
Some day Ill know itand then Ill tell you Bev
Long long after she kept her word
Forty years later I wrote to her across the leagues of land and sea that divided us and told her that Jasper Dale was dead and I reminded her of her old promise and asked its fulfilment
In reply she sent me the written love story of Jasper Dale and Alice Reade
Now when Alice sleeps under the whispering elms of the old Carlisle churchyard beside the husband of her youth that story may be given in all its oldtime sweetness to the world
CHAPTER XXV THE LOVE STORY OF THE AWKWARD MAN Written by the Story Girl Jasper Dale lived alone in the old homestead which he had named Golden Milestone
In Carlisle this giving ones farm a name was looked upon as a piece of affectation but if a place must be named why not give it a sensible name with some meaning to it
Why Golden Milestone when Pinewood or Hillslope or if you wanted to be very fanciful Ivy Lodge might be had for the taking
He had lived alone at Golden Milestone since his mothers death he had been twenty then and he was close upon forty now though he did not look it
But neither could it be said that he looked young he had never at any time looked young with common youth there had always been something in his appearance that stamped him as different from the ordinary run of men and apart from his shyness built up an intangible invisible barrier between him and his kind
He had lived all his life in Carlisle and all the Carlisle people knew of or about himalthough they thought they knew everythingwas that he was painfully abnormally shy
He never went anywhere except to church he never took part in Carlisles simple social life even with most men he was distant and reserved as for women he never spoke to or looked at them if one spoke to him even if she were a matronly old mother in Israel he was at once in an agony of painful blushes
He had no friends in the sense of companions to all outward appearance his life was solitary and devoid of any human interest
He had no housekeeper but his old house furnished as it had been in his mothers lifetime was cleanly and daintily kept
The quaint rooms were as free from dust and disorder as a woman could have had them
This was known because Jasper Dale occasionally had his hired mans wife Mrs Griggs in to scrub for him
On the morning she was expected he betook himself to woods and fields returning only at nightfall
During his absence Mrs Griggs was frankly wont to explore the house from cellar to attic and her report of its condition was always the sameneat as wax
To be sure there was one room that was always locked against her the west gable looking out on the garden and the hill of pines beyond
But Mrs Griggs knew that in the lifetime of Jasper Dales mother it had been unfurnished
She supposed it still remained so and felt no especial curiosity concerning it though she always tried the door
Jasper Dale had a good farm well cultivated he had a large garden where he worked most of his spare time in summer it was supposed that he read a great deal since the postmistress declared that he was always getting books and magazines by mail
He seemed well contented with his existence and people let him alone since that was the greatest kindness they could do him
It was unsupposable that he would ever marry nobody ever had supposed it
Jasper Dale never so much as THOUGHT about a woman Carlisle oracles declared
Oracles however are not always to be trusted
One day Mrs Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious story which she diligently spread far and wide
It made a good deal of talk but people although they listened eagerly and wondered and questioned were rather incredulous about it
They thought Mrs Griggs must be drawing considerably upon her imagination there were not lacking those who declared that she had invented the whole account since her reputation for strict veracity was not wholly unquestioned
Mrs Griggss story was as follows One day she found the door of the west gable unlocked
She went in expecting to see bare walls and a collection of odds and ends
Instead she found herself in a finely furnished room
Delicate lace curtains hung before the small square broadsilled windows
The walls were adorned with pictures in much finer taste than Mrs Griggs could appreciate
There was a bookcase between the windows filled with choicely bound books
Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty workbasket on it
By the basket Mrs Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors and a silver thimble
A wicker rocker comfortable with silk cushions was near it
Above the bookcase a womans picture hunga watercolour if Mrs Griggs had but known itrepresenting a pale very sweet face with large dark eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of black lustrous hair
Just beneath the picture on the top shelf of the bookcase was a vaseful of flowers
Another vaseful stood on the table beside the basket
All this was astonishing enough
But what puzzled Mrs Griggs completely was the fact that a womans dress was hanging over a chair before the mirrora pale blue silken affair
And on the floor beside it were two little blue satin slippers
Good Mrs Griggs did not leave the room until she had thoroughly explored it even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering it to be a teagownwrapper she called it
But she found nothing to throw any light on the mystery
The fact that the simple name Alice was written on the flyleaves of all the books only deepened it for it was a name unknown in the Dale family
In this puzzled state she was obliged to depart nor did she ever find the door unlocked again and discovering that people thought she was romancing when she talked about the mysterious west gable at Golden Milestone she indignantly held her peace concerning the whole affair
But Mrs Griggs had told no more than the simple truth
Jasper Dale under all his shyness and aloofness possessed a nature full of delicate romance and poesy which denied expression in the common ways of life bloomed out in the realm of fancy and imagination
Left alone just when the boys nature was deepening into the mans he turned to this ideal kingdom for all he believed the real world could never give him
Lovea strange almost mystical loveplayed its part here for him
He shadowed forth to himself the vision of a woman loving and beloved he cherished it until it became almost as real to him as his own personality and he gave this dream woman the name he liked best Alice
In fancy he walked and talked with her spoke words of love to her and heard words of love in return
When he came from work at the close of day she met him at his threshold in the twilight a strange fair starry shape as elusive and spiritual as a blossom reflected in a pool by moonlightwith welcome on her lips and in her eyes
One day when he was in Charlottetown on business he had been struck by a picture in the window of a store
It was strangely like the woman of his dream love
He went in awkward and embarrassed and bought it
When he took it home he did not know where to put it
It was out of place among the dim old engravings of bewigged portraits and conventional landscapes on the walls of Golden Milestone
As he pondered the matter in his garden that evening he had an inspiration
The sunset flaming on the windows of the west gable kindled them into burning rose
Amid the splendour he fancied Alices fair face peeping archly down at him from the room
The inspiration came then
It should be her room he would fit it up for her and her picture should hang there
He was all summer carrying out his plan
Nobody must know or suspect so he must go slowly and secretly
One by one the furnishings were purchased and brought home under cover of darkness
He arranged them with his own hands
He bought the books he thought she would like best and wrote her name in them he got the little feminine knickknacks of basket and thimble
Finally he saw in a store a pale blue teagown and the satin slippers
He had always fancied her as dressed in blue
He bought them and took them home to her room
Thereafter it was sacred to her he always knocked on its door before he entered he kept it sweet with fresh flowers he sat there in the purple summer evenings and talked aloud to her or read his favourite books to her
In his fancy she sat opposite to him in her rocker clad in the trailing blue gown with her head leaning on one slender hand as white as a twilight star
But Carlisle people knew nothing of thiswould have thought him tinged with mild lunacy if they had known
To them he was just the shy simple farmer he appeared
They never knew or guessed at the real Jasper Dale
One spring Alice Reade came to teach music in Carlisle
Her pupils worshipped her but the grown people thought she was rather too distant and reserved
They had been used to merry jolly girls who joined eagerly in the social life of the place
Alice Reade held herself aloof from itnot disdainfully but as one to whom these things were of small importance
She was very fond of books and solitary rambles she was not at all shy but she was as sensitive as a flower and after a time Carlisle people were content to let her live her own life and no longer resented her unlikeness to themselves
She boarded with the Armstrongs who lived beyond Golden Milestone around the hill of pines
Until the snow disappeared she went out to the main road by the long Armstrong lane but when spring came she was wont to take a shorter way down the pine hill across the brook past Jasper Dales garden and out through his lane
And one day as she went by Jasper Dale was working in his garden
He was on his knees in a corner setting out a bunch of rootsan unsightly little tangle of rainbow possibilities
It was a still spring morning the world was green with young leaves a little wind blew down from the pines and lost itself willingly among the budding delights of the garden
The grass opened eyes of blue violets
The sky was high and cloudless turquoiseblue shading off into milkiness on the far horizons
Birds were singing along the brook valley
Rollicking robins were whistling joyously in the pines
Jasper Dales heart was filled to overflowing with a realization of all the virgin loveliness around him the feeling in his soul had the sacredness of a prayer
At this moment he looked up and saw Alice Reade
She was standing outside the garden fence in the shadow of a great pine tree looking not at him for she was unaware of his presence but at the virginal bloom of the plum trees in a far corner with all her delight in it outblossoming freely in her face
For a moment Jasper Dale believed that his dream love had taken visible form before him
She was likeso like not in feature perhaps but in grace and colouringthe grace of a slender lissome form and the colouring of cloudy hair and wistful dark gray eyes and curving red mouth and more than all she was like her in expressionin the subtle revelation of personality exhaling from her like perfume from a flower
It was as if his own had come to him at last and his whole soul suddenly leaped out to meet and welcome her
Then her eyes fell upon him and the spell was broken
Jasper remained kneeling mutely there shy man once more crimson with blushes a strange almost pitiful creature in his abject confusion
A little smile flickered about the delicate corners of her mouth but she turned and walked swiftly away down the lane
Jasper looked after her with a new painful sense of loss and loveliness
It had been agony to feel her conscious eyes upon him but he realized now that there had been a strange sweetness in it too
It was still greater pain to watch her going from him
He thought she must be the new music teacher but he did not even know her name
She had been dressed in blue tooa pale dainty blue but that was of course he had known she must wear it and he was sure her name must be Alice
When later on he discovered that it was he felt no surprise
He carried some mayflowers up to the west gable and put them under the picture
But the charm had gone out of the tribute and looking at the picture he thought how scant was the justice it did her
Her face was so much sweeter her eyes so much softer her hair so much more lustrous
The soul of his love had gone from the room and from the picture and from his dreams
When he tried to think of the Alice he loved he saw not the shadowy spirit occupant of the west gable but the young girl who had stood under the pine beautiful with the beauty of moonlight of starshine on still water of white windswayed flowers growing in silent shadowy places
He did not then realize what this meant had he realized it he would have suffered bitterly as it was he felt only a vague discomforta curious sense of loss and gain commingled
He saw her again that afternoon on her way home
She did not pause by the garden but walked swiftly past
Thereafter every day for a week he watched unseen to see her pass his home
Once a little child was with her clinging to her hand
No child had ever before had any part in the shy mans dream life
But that night in the twilight the vision of the rockingchair was a girl in a blue print dress with a little goldenhaired shape at her kneea shape that lisped and prattled and called her mother and both of them were his
It was the next day that he failed for the first time to put flowers in the west gable
Instead he cut a loose handful of daffodils and looking furtively about him as if committing a crime he laid them across the footpath under the pine
She must pass that way her feet would crush them if she failed to see them
Then he slipped back into his garden half exultant half repentant
From a safe retreat he saw her pass by and stoop to lift his flowers
Thereafter he put some in the same place every day
When Alice Reade saw the flowers she knew at once who had put them there and divined that they were for her
She lifted them tenderly in much surprise and pleasure
She had heard all about Jasper Dale and his shyness but before she had heard about him she had seen him in church and liked him
She thought his face and his dark blue eyes beautiful she even liked the long brown hair that Carlisle people laughed at
That he was quite different from other people she had understood at once but she thought the difference in his favour
Perhaps her sensitive nature divined and responded to the beauty in his
At least in her eyes Jasper Dale was never a ridiculous figure
When she heard the story of the west gable which most people disbelieved she believed it although she did not understand it
It invested the shy man with interest and romance
She felt that she would have liked out of no impertinent curiosity to solve the mystery she believed that it contained the key to his character
Thereafter every day she found flowers under the pine tree she wished to see Jasper to thank him unaware that he watched her daily from the screen of shrubbery in his garden but it was some time before she found the opportunity
One evening she passed when he not expecting her was leaning against his garden fence with a book in his hand
She stopped under the pine
Mr Dale she said softly I want to thank you for your flowers
Jasper startled wished that he might sink into the ground
His anguish of embarrassment made her smile a little
He could not speak so she went on gently
It has been so good of you
They have given me so much pleasure I wish you could know how much
It was nothingnothing stammered Jasper
His book had fallen on the ground at her feet and she picked it up and held it out to him
So you like Ruskin she said
I do too
But I havent read this
If youwould careto read ityou may have it Jasper contrived to say
She carried the book away with her
He did not again hide when she passed and when she brought the book back they talked a little about it over the fence
He lent her others and got some from her in return they fell into the habit of discussing them
Jasper did not find it hard to talk to her now it seemed as if he were talking to his dream Alice and it came strangely natural to him
He did not talk volubly but Alice thought what he did say was worth while
His words lingered in her memory and made music
She always found his flowers under the pine and she always wore some of them but she did not know if he noticed this or not
One evening Jasper walked shyly with her from his gate up the pine hill
After that he always walked that far with her
She would have missed him much if he had failed to do so yet it did not occur to her that she was learning to love him
She would have laughed with girlish scorn at the idea
She liked him very much she thought his nature beautiful in its simplicity and purity in spite of his shyness she felt more delightfully at home in his society than in that of any other person she had ever met
He was one of those rare souls whose friendship is at once a pleasure and a benediction showering light from their own crystal clearness into all the dark corners in the souls of others until for the time being at least they reflected his own nobility
But she never thought of love
Like other girls she had her dreams of a possible Prince Charming young and handsome and debonair
It never occurred to her that he might be found in the shy dreamy recluse of Golden Milestone
In August came a day of gold and blue
Alice Reade coming through the trees with the wind blowing her little dark love locks tricksily about under her wide blue hat found a fragrant heap of mignonette under the pine
She lifted it and buried her face in it drinking in the wholesome modest perfume
She had hoped Jasper would be in his garden since she wished to ask him for a book she greatly desired to read
But she saw him sitting on the rustic seat at the further side
His back was towards her and he was partially screened by a copse of lilacs
Alice blushing slightly unlatched the garden gate and went down the path
She had never been in the garden before and she found her heart beating in a strange fashion
He did not hear her footsteps and she was close behind him when she heard his voice and realized that he was talking to himself in a low dreamy tone
As the meaning of his words dawned on her consciousness she started and grew crimson
She could not move or speak as one in a dream she stood and listened to the shy mans reverie guiltless of any thought of eavesdropping
How much I love you Alice Jasper Dale was saying unafraid with no shyness in voice or manner
I wonder what you would say if you knew
You would laugh at mesweet as you are you would laugh in mockery
I can never tell you
I can only dream of telling you
In my dream you are standing here by me dear
I can see you very plainly my sweet lady so tall and gracious with your dark hair and your maiden eyes
I can dream that I tell you my love thatmaddest sweetest dream of allthat you love me in return
Everything is possible in dreams you know dear
My dreams are all I have so I go far in them even to dreaming that you are my wife
I dream how I shall fix up my dull old house for you
One room will need nothing moreit is your room dear and has been ready for you a long timelong before that day I saw you under the pine
Your books and your chair and your picture are there dearonly the picture is not half lovely enough
But the other rooms of the house must be made to bloom out freshly for you
What a delight it is thus to dream of what I would do for you
Then I would bring you home dear and lead you through my garden and into my house as its mistress
I would see you standing beside me in the old mirror at the end of the halla bride in your pale blue dress with a blush on your face
I would lead you through all the rooms made ready for your coming and then to your own
I would see you sitting in your own chair and all my dreams would find rich fulfilment in that royal moment
Oh Alice we would have a beautiful life together
Its sweet to make believe about it
You will sing to me in the twilight and we will gather early flowers together in the spring days
When I come home from work tired you will put your arms about me and lay your head on my shoulder
I will stroke itsothat bonny glossy head of yours
Alice my Aliceall mine in my dream never to be mine in real lifehow I love you
The Alice behind him could bear no more
She gave a little choking cry that betrayed her presence
Jasper Dale sprang up and gazed upon her
He saw her standing there amid the languorous shadows of August pale with feeling wideeyed trembling
For a moment shyness wrung him
Then every trace of it was banished by a sudden strange fierce anger that swept over him
He felt outraged and hurt to the death he felt as if he had been cheated out of something incalculably preciousas if sacrilege had been done to his most holy sanctuary of emotion
White tense with his anger he looked at her and spoke his lips as pale as if his fiery words scathed them
How dare you
You have spied on meyou have crept in and listened
How dare you
Do you know what you have done girl
You have destroyed all that made life worth while to me
My dream is dead
It could not live when it was betrayed
And it was all I had
Oh laugh at memock me
I know that I am ridiculous
What of it
It never could have hurt you
Why must you creep in like this to hear me and put me to shame
Oh I love youI will say it laugh as you will
Is it such a strange thing that I should have a heart like other men
This will make sport for you
I who love you better than my life better than any other man in the world can love you will be a jest to you all your life
I love youand yet I think I could hate youyou have destroyed my dreamyou have done me deadly wrong
Jasper
Jasper
cried Alice finding her voice
His anger hurt her with a pain she could not endure
It was unbearable that Jasper should be angry with her
In that moment she realized that she loved himthat the words he had spoken when unconscious of her presence were the sweetest she had ever heard or ever could hear
Nothing mattered at all save that he loved her and was angry with her
Dont say such dreadful things to me she stammered I did not mean to listen
I could not help it
I shall never laugh at you
Oh Jaspershe looked bravely at him and the fine soul of her shone through the flesh like an illuminating lampI am glad that you love me
and I am glad I chanced to overhear you since you would never have had the courage to tell me otherwise
Glad glad
Do you understand Jasper
Jasper looked at her with the eyes of one who looking through pain sees rapture beyond
Is it possible
he said wonderingly
AliceI am so much older than youand they call me the Awkward Manthey say I am unlike other people You ARE unlike other people she said softly and that is why I love you
I know now that I must have loved you ever since I saw you
I loved you long before I saw you said Jasper
He came close to her and drew her into his arms tenderly and reverently all his shyness and awkwardness swallowed up in the grace of his great happiness
In the old garden he kissed her lips and Alice entered into her own
CHAPTER XXVI UNCLE BLAIR COMES HOME It happened that the Story Girl and I both got up very early on the morning of the Awkward Mans wedding day
Uncle Alec was going to Charlottetown that day and I awakened at daybreak by the sounds in the kitchen beneath us remembered that I had forgotten to ask him to bring me a certain schoolbook I wanted
So I hurriedly dressed and hastened down to tell him before he went
I was joined on the stairs by the Story Girl who said she had wakened and not feeling like going to sleep again thought she might as well get up
I had such a funny dream last night she said
I dreamed that I heard a voice calling me from away down in Uncle Stephens Walk Sara Sara Sara it kept calling
I didnt know whose it was and yet it seemed like a voice I knew
I wakened up while it was calling and it seemed so real I could hardly believe it was a dream
It was bright moonlight and I felt just like getting up and going out to the orchard
But I knew that would be silly and of course I didnt go
But I kept on wanting to and I couldnt sleep any more
Wasnt it queer
When Uncle Alec had gone I proposed a saunter to the farther end of the orchard where I had left a book the preceding evening
A young mom was walking rosily on the hills as we passed down Uncle Stephens Walk with Paddy trotting before us
High overhead was the spiritlike blue of paling skies the east was a great arc of crystal smitten through with auroral crimsonings just above it was one milkwhite star of morning like a pearl on a silver sea
A light wind of dawn was weaving an orient spell
Its lovely to be up as early as this isnt it
said the Story Girl
The world seems so different just at sunrise doesnt it
It makes me feel just like getting up to see the sun rise every morning of my life after this
But I know I wont
Ill likely sleep later than ever tomorrow morning
But I wish I could
The Awkward Man and Miss Reade are going to have a lovely day for their wedding I said
Yes and Im so glad
Beautiful Alice deserves everything good
Why Bevwhy Bev
Who is that in the hammock
I looked
The hammock was swung under the two end trees of the Walk
In it a man was lying asleep his head pillowed on his overcoat
He was sleeping easily lightly and wholesomely
He had a pointed brown beard and thick wavy brown hair
His cheeks were a dusky red and the lashes of his closed eyes were as long and dark and silken as a girls
He wore a light gray suit and on the slender white hand that hung down over the hammocks edge was a spark of diamond fire
It seemed to me that I knew his face although assuredly I had never seen him before
While I groped among vague speculations the Story Girl gave a queer choked little cry
The next moment she had sprung over the intervening space dropped on her knees by the hammock and flung her arms about the mans neck
Father
Father
she cried while I stood rooted to the ground in my amazement
The sleeper stirred and opened two large exceedingly brilliant hazel eyes
For a moment he gazed rather blankly at the brown curled young lady who was embracing him
Then a most delightful smile broke over his face he sprang up and caught her to his heart
SaraSaramy little Sara
To think didnt know you at first glance
But you are almost a woman
And when I saw you last you were just a little girl of eight
My own little Sara
Fatherfathersometimes Ive wondered if you were ever coming back to me I heard the Story Girl say as I turned and scuttled up the Walk realizing that I was not wanted there just then and would be little missed
Various emotions and speculations possessed my mind in my retreat but chiefly did I feel a sense of triumph in being the bearer of exciting news
Aunt Janet Uncle Blair is here I announced breathlessly at the kitchen door
Aunt Janet who was kneading her bread turned round and lifted floury hands
Felicity and Cecily who were just entering the kitchen rosy from slumber stopped still and stared at me
Uncle who
exclaimed Aunt Janet
Uncle Blairthe Story Girls father you know
Hes here
WHERE
Down in the orchard
He was asleep in the hammock
We found him there
Dear me
said Aunt Janet sitting down helplessly
If that isnt like Blair
Of course he couldnt come like anybody else
I wonder she added in a tone unheard by anyone else save myself I wonder if he has come to take the child away
My elation went out like a snuffed candle
I had never thought of this
If Uncle Blair took the Story Girl away would not life become rather savourless on the hill farm
I turned and followed Felicity and Cecily out in a very subdued mood
Uncle Blair and the Story Girl were just coming out of the orchard
His arm was about her and hers was on his shoulder
Laughter and tears were contending in her eyes
Only once before when Peter had come back from the Valley of the Shadowhad I seen the Story Girl cry
Emotion had to go very deep with her ere it touched the source of tears
I had always known that she loved her father passionately though she rarely talked of him understanding that her uncles and aunts were not wholeheartedly his friends
But Aunt Janets welcome was cordial enough though a trifle flustered
Whatever thrifty hardworking farmer folk might think of gay Bohemian Blair Stanley in his absence in his presence even they liked him by the grace of some winsome lovable quality in the soul of him
He had a way with himrevealed even in the manner with which he caught staid Aunt Janet in his arms swung her matronly form around as though she had been a slim schoolgirl and kissed her rosy cheek
Sister o mine are you never going to grow old
he said
Here you are at fortyfive with the roses of sixteenand not a gray hair Ill wager
Blair Blair it is you who are always young laughed Aunt Janet not ill pleased
Where in the world did you come from
And what is this I hear of your sleeping all night in the hammock
Ive been painting in the Lake District all summer as you know answered Uncle Blair and one day I just got homesick to see my little girl
So I sailed for Montreal without further delay
I got here at eleven last nightthe stationmasters son drove me down
Nice boy
The old house was in darkness and I thought it would be a shame to rouse you all out of bed after a hard days work
So I decided that I would spend the night in the orchard
It was moonlight you know and moonlight in an old orchard is one of the few things left over from the Golden Age
It was very foolish of you said practical Aunt Janet
These September nights are real chilly
You might have caught your death of coldor a bad dose of rheumatism
So I might
No doubt it was foolish of me agreed Uncle Blair gaily
It must have been the fault of the moonlight
Moonlight you know Sister Janet has an intoxicating quality
It is a fine airy silver wine such as fairies may drink at their revels unharmed of it but when a mere mortal sips of it it mounts straightway to his brain to the undoing of his daylight common sense
However I have got neither cold nor rheumatism as a sensible person would have done had he ever been lured into doing such a nonsensible thing there is a special Providence for us foolish folk
I enjoyed my night in the orchard for a time I was companioned by sweet old memories and then I fell asleep listening to the murmurs of the wind in those old trees yonder
And I had a beautiful dream Janet
I dreamed that the old orchard blossomed again as it did that spring eighteen years ago
I dreamed that its sunshine was the sunshine of spring not autumn
There was newness of life in my dream Janet and the sweetness of forgotten words
Wasnt it strange about MY dream
whispered the Story Girl to me
Well youd better come in and have some breakfast said Aunt Janet
These are my little girlsFelicity and Cecily
I remember them as two most adorable tots said Uncle Blair shaking hands
They havent changed quite so much as my own babychild
Why shes a woman Janetshes a woman
Shes child enough still said Aunt Janet hastily
The Story Girl shook her long brown curls
Im fifteen she said
And you ought to see me in my long dress father
We must not be separated any longer dear heart I heard Uncle Blair say tenderly
I hoped that he meant he would stay in Canadanot that he would take the Story Girl away
Apart from this we had a gay day with Uncle Blair
He evidently liked our society better than that of the grownups for he was a child himself at heart gay irresponsible always acting on the impulse of the moment
We all found him a delightful companion
There was no school that day as Mr Perkins was absent attending a meeting of the Teachers Convention so we spent most of its golden hours in the orchard with Uncle Blair listening to his fascinating accounts of foreign wanderings
He also drew all our pictures for us and this was especially delightful for the day of the camera was only just dawning and none of us had ever had even our photographs taken
Sara Rays pleasure was as usual quite spoiled by wondering what her mother would say of it for Mrs Ray had so it appeared some very peculiar prejudices against the taking or making of any kind of picture whatsoever owing to an exceedingly strict interpretation of the second commandment
Dan suggested that she need not tell her mother anything about it but Sara shook her head
Ill have to tell her
Ive made it a rule to tell ma everything I do ever since the Judgment Day
Besides added Cecily seriously the Family Guide says one ought to tell ones mother everything
Its pretty hard sometimes though sighed Sara
Ma scolds so much when I do tell her things that it sort of discourages me
But when I think of how dreadful I felt the time of the Judgment Day over deceiving her in some things it nerves me up
Id do almost anything rather than feel like that the next time the Judgment Day comes
Fe fi fo fum I smell a story said Uncle Blair
What do you mean by speaking of the Judgment Day in the past tense
The Story Girl told him the tale of that dreadful Sunday in the preceding summer and we all laughed with him at ourselves
All the same muttered Peter I dont want to have another experience like that
I hope Ill be dead the next time the Judgment Day comes
But youll be raised up for it said Felix
Oh thatll be all right
I wont mind that
I wont know anything about it till it really happens
Its the expecting it thats the worst
I dont think you ought to talk of such things said Felicity
When evening came we all went to Golden Milestone
We knew the Awkward Man and his bride were expected home at sunset and we meant to scatter flowers on the path by which she must enter her new home
It was the Story Girls idea but I dont think Aunt Janet would have let us go if Uncle Blair had not pleaded for us
He asked to be taken along too and we agreed if he would stand out of sight when the newly married pair came home
You see father the Awkward Man wont mind us because were only children and he knows us well explained the Story Girl but if he sees you a stranger it might confuse him and we might spoil the homecoming and that would be such a pity
So we went to Golden Milestone laden with all the flowery spoil we could plunder from both gardens
It was a clear ambertinted September evening and far away over Markdale Harbour a great round red moon was rising as we waited
Uncle Blair was hidden behind the windblown tassels of the pines at the gate but he and the Story Girl kept waving their hands at each other and calling out gay mirthful jests
Do you really feel acquainted with your father
whispered Sara Ray wonderingly
Its long since you saw him
If I hadnt seen him for a hundred years it wouldnt make any difference that way laughed the Story Girl
Sshsshtheyre coming whispered Felicity excitedly
And then they cameBeautiful Alice blushing and lovely in the prettiest of pretty blue dresses and the Awkward Man so fervently happy that he quite forgot to be awkward
He lifted her out of the buggy gallantly and led her forward to us smiling
We retreated before them scattering our flowers lavishly on the path and Alice Dale walked to the very doorstep of her new home over a carpet of blossoms
On the step they both paused and turned towards us and we shyly did the proper thing in the way of congratulations and good wishes
It was so sweet of you to do this said the smiling bride
It was lovely to be able to do it for you dearest whispered the Story Girl and oh Miss ReadeMrs Dale I meanwe all hope youll be so so happy for ever
I am sure I shall said Alice Dale turning to her husband
He looked down into her eyesand we were quite forgotten by both of them
We saw it and slipped away while Jasper Dale drew his wife into their home and shut the world out
We scampered joyously away through the moonlit dusk
Uncle Blair joined us at the gate and the Story Girl asked him what he thought of the bride
When she dies white violets will grow out of her dust he answered
Uncle Blair says even queerer things than the Story Girl Felicity whispered to me
And so that beautiful day went away from us slipping through our fingers as we tried to hold it
It hooded itself in shadows and fared forth on the road that is lighted by the white stars of evening
It had been a gift of Paradise
Its hours had all been fair and beloved
From dawn flush to fall of night there had been naught to mar it
It took with it its smiles and laughter
But it left the boon of memory
CHAPTER XXVII THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH I am going away with father when he goes
He is going to spend the winter in Paris and I am to go to school there
The Story Girl told us this one day in the orchard
There was a little elation in her tone but more regret
The news was not a great surprise to us
We had felt it in the air ever since Uncle Blairs arrival
Aunt Janet had been very unwilling to let the Story Girl go
But Uncle Blair was inexorable
It was time he said that she should go to a better school than the little country one in Carlisle and besides he did not want her to grow into womanhood a stranger to him
So it was finally decided that she was to go
Just think you are going to Europe said Sara Ray in an awe struck tone
Wont that be splendid
I suppose Ill like it after a while said the Story Girl slowly but I know Ill be dreadfully homesick at first
Of course it will be lovely to be with father but oh Ill miss the rest of you so much
Just think how WELL miss YOU sighed Cecily
It will be so lonesome here this winter with you and Peter both gone
Oh dear I do wish things didnt have to change
Felicity said nothing
She kept looking down at the grass on which she sat absently pulling at the slender blades
Presently we saw two big tears roll down over her cheeks
The Story Girl looked surprised
Are you crying because Im going away Felicity
she asked
Of course I am answered Felicity with a big sob
Do you think Ive no ffeeling
I didnt think youd care much said the Story Girl frankly
Youve never seemed to like me very much
I ddont wear my hheart on my sleeve said poor Felicity with an attempt at dignity
I think you mmight stay
Your father would let you sstay if you ccoaxed him
Well you see Id have to go some time sighed the Story Girl and the longer it was put off the harder it would be
But I do feel dreadfully about it
I cant even take poor Paddy
Ill have to leave him behind and oh I want you all to promise to be kind to him for my sake
We all solemnly assured her that we would
Ill ggive him cream every mmorning and nnight sobbed Felicity but Ill never be able to look at him without crying
Hell make me think of you
Well Im not going right away said the Story Girl more cheerfully
Not till the last of October
So we have over a month yet to have a good time in
Lets all just determine to make it a splendid month for the last
We wont think about my going at all till we have to and we wont have any quarrels among us and well just enjoy ourselves all we possibly can
So dont cry any more Felicity
Im awfully glad you do like me and am sorry Im going away but lets all forget it for a month
Felicity sighed and tucked away her damp handkerchief
It isnt so easy for me to forget things but Ill try she said disconsolately and if you want any more cooking lessons before you go Ill be real glad to teach you anything I know
This was a high plane of selfsacrifice for Felicity to attain
But the Story Girl shook her head
No Im not going to bother my head about cooking lessons this last month
Its too vexing
Do you remember the time you made the pudding began Peter and suddenly stopped
Out of sawdust
finished the Story Girl cheerfully
You neednt be afraid to mention it to me after this
I dont mind any more
I begin to see the fun of it now
I should think I do remember itand the time I baked the bread before it was raised enough
People have made worse mistakes than that said Felicity kindly
Such as using toothpowd but here Dan stopped abruptly remembering the Story Girls plea for a beautiful month
Felicity coloured but said nothingdid not even LOOK anything
We HAVE had lots of fun together one way or another said Cecily retrospectively
Just think how much weve laughed this last year or so said the Story Girl
Weve had good times together but I think well have lots more splendid years ahead
Eden is always behind usParadise always before said Uncle Blair coming up in time to hear her
He said it with a sigh that was immediately lost in one of his delightful smiles
I like Uncle Blair so much better than I expected to Felicity confided to me
Mother says hes a rolling stone but there really is something very nice about him although he says a great many things I dont understand
I suppose the Story Girl will have a very gay time in Paris
Shes going to school and shell have to study hard I said
She says shes going to study for the stage said Felicity
Uncle Roger thinks it is all right and says shell be very famous some day
But mother thinks its dreadful and so do I
Aunt Julia is a concert singer I said
Oh thats very different
But I hope poor Sara will get on all right sighed Felicity
You never know what may happen to a person in those foreign countries
And everybody says Paris is such a wicked place
But we must hope for the best she concluded in a resigned tone
That evening the Story Girl and I drove the cows to pasture after milking and when we came home we sought out Uncle Blair in the orchard
He was sauntering up and down Uncle Stephens Walk his hands clasped behind him and his beautiful youthful face uplifted to the western sky where waves of night were breaking on a dim primrose shore of sunset
See that star over there in the southwest
he said as we joined him
The one just above that pine
An evening star shining over a dark pine tree is the whitest thing in the universebecause it is LIVING whitenesswhiteness possessing a soul
How full this old orchard is of twilight
Do you know I have been trysting here with ghosts
The Family Ghost
I asked very stupidly
No not the Family Ghost
I never saw beautiful brokenhearted Emily yet
Your mother saw her once Sarathat was a strange thing he added absently as if to himself
Did mother really see her
whispered the Story Girl
Well she always believed she did
Who knows
Do you think there are such things as ghosts Uncle Blair
I asked curiously
I never saw any Beverley
But you said you were trysting with ghosts here this evening said the Story Girl
Oh yesthe ghosts of the old years
I love this orchard because of its many ghosts
We are good comrades those ghosts and I we walk and talkwe even laugh togethersorrowful laughter that has sorrows own sweetness
And always there comes to me one dear phantom and wanders hand in hand with mea lost lady of the old years
My mother
said the Story Girl very softly
Yes your mother
Here in her old haunts it is impossible for me to believe that she can be deadthat her LAUGHTER can be dead
She was the gayest sweetest thingand so youngonly three years older than you Sara
Yonder old house had been glad because of her for eighteen years when I met her first
I wish I could remember her said the Story Girl with a little sigh
I havent even a picture of her
Why didnt you paint one father
She would never let me
She had some queer funny halfplayful halfearnest superstition about it
But I always meant to when she would become willing to let me
And thenshe died
Her twin brother Felix died the same day
There was something strange about that too
I was holding her in my arms and she was looking up at me suddenly she looked past me and gave a little start
Felix
she said
For a moment she trembled and then she smiled and looked up at me again a little beseechingly
Felix has come for me dear she said
We were always together before you cameyou must not mindyou must be glad I do not have to go alone
Well who knows
But she left me Sarashe left me
There was that in Uncle Blairs voice that kept us silent for a time
Then the Story Girl said still very softly What did mother look like father
I dont look the least little bit like her do I
No I wish you did you brown thing
Your mothers face was as white as a woodlily with only a faint dream of rose in her cheeks
She had the eyes of one who always had a song in her heartblue as a mist those eyes were
She had dark lashes and a little red mouth that quivered when she was very sad or very happy like a crimson rose too rudely shaken by the wind
She was as slim and lithe as a young whitestemmed birch tree
How I loved her
How happy we were
But he who accepts human love must bind it to his soul with pain and she is not lost to me
Nothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it
Uncle Blair looked up at the evening star
We saw that he had forgotten us and we slipped away hand in hand leaving him alone in the memoryhaunted shadows of the old orchard
CHAPTER XXVIII THE PATH TO ARCADY October that year gathered up all the spilled sunshine of the summer and clad herself in it as in a garment
The Story Girl had asked us to try to make the last month together beautiful and Nature seconded our efforts giving us that most beautiful of beautiful thingsa gracious and perfect moon of falling leaves
There was not in all that vanished October one day that did not come in with auroral splendour and go out attended by a fair galaxy of evening starsnot a day when there were not golden lights in the wide pastures and purple hazes in the ripened distances
Never was anything so gorgeous as the maple trees that year
Maples are trees that have primeval fire in their souls
It glows out a little in their early youth before the leaves open in the redness and rosyyellowness of their blossoms but in summer it is carefully hidden under a demure silverlined greenness
Then when autumn comes the maples give up trying to be sober and flame out in all the barbaric splendour and gorgeousness of their real nature making of the hills things out of an Arabian Nights dream in the golden prime of good Haroun Alraschid
You may never know what scarlet and crimson really are until you see them in their perfection on an October hillside under the unfathomable blue of an autumn sky
All the glow and radiance and joy at earths heart seem to have broken loose in a splendid determination to express itself for once before the frost of winter chills her beating pulses
It is the years carnival ere the dull Lenten days of leafless valleys and penitential mists come
The time of applepicking had come around once more and we worked joyously
Uncle Blair picked apples with us and between him and the Story Girl it was an October never to be forgotten
Will you go far afield for a walk with me today
he said to her and me one idle afternoon of opal skies pied meadows and misty hills
It was Saturday and Peter had gone home Felix and Dan were helping Uncle Alec top turnips Cecily and Felicity were making cookies for Sunday so the Story Girl and I were alone in Uncle Stephens Walk
We liked to be alone together that last month to think the long long thoughts of youth and talk about our futures
There had grown up between us that summer a bond of sympathy that did not exist between us and the others
We were older than theythe Story Girl was fifteen and I was nearly that and all at once it seemed as if we were immeasurably older than the rest and possessed of dreams and visions and forwardreaching hopes which they could not possibly share or understand
At times we were still children still interested in childish things
But there came hours when we seemed to our two selves very grown up and old and in those hours we talked our dreams and visions and hopes vague and splendid as all such are over together and so began to build up out of the rainbow fragments of our childhoods companionship that rare and beautiful friendship which was to last all our lives enriching and enstarring them
For there is no bond more lasting than that formed by the mutual confidences of that magic time when youth is slipping from the sheath of childhood and beginning to wonder what lies for it beyond those misty hills that bound the golden road
Where are you going
asked the Story Girl
To the woods that belt the gray hillsideay and overflow beyond it into many a valley purplefolded in immemorial peace answered Uncle Blair
I have a fancy for one more ramble in Prince Edward Island woods before I leave Canada again
But I would not go alone
So come you two gay youthful things to whom all life is yet fair and good and we will seek the path to Arcady
There will be many little things along our way to make us glad
Joyful sounds will come ringing down the wind a wealth of gypsy gold will be ours for the gathering we will learn the potent unutterable charm of a dim spruce wood and the grace of flexile mountain ashes fringing a lonely glen we will tryst with the folk of fur and feather well hearken to the music of gray old firs
Come and youll have a ramble and an afternoon that you will both remember all your lives
We did have it never has its remembrance faded that idyllic afternoon of roving in the old Carlisle woods with the Story Girl and Uncle Blair gleams in my book of years a page of living beauty
Yet it was but a few hours of simplest pleasure we wandered pathlessly through the sylvan calm of those dear places which seemed that day to be full of a great friendliness Uncle Blair sauntered along behind us whistling softly sometimes he talked to himself we delighted in those brief reveries of his Uncle Blair was the only man I have ever known who could when he so willed talk like a book and do it without seeming ridiculous perhaps it was because he had the knack of choosing fit audience though few and the proper time to appeal to that audience
We went across the fields intending to skirt the woods at the back of Uncle Alecs farm and find a lane that cut through Uncle Rogers woods but before we came to it we stumbled on a sly winding little path quite by accidentif indeed there can be such a thing as accident in the woods where I am tempted to think we are led by the Good People along such of their fairy ways as they have a mind for us to walk in
Go to let us explore this said Uncle Blair
It always drags terribly at my heart to go past a wood lane if I can make any excuse at all for traversing it for it is the byways that lead to the heart of the woods and we must follow them if we would know the forest and be known of it
When we can really feel its wild heart beating against ours its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own for ever so that no matter where we go or how wide we wander in the noisy ways of cities or over the lone ways of the sea we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship
I always feel so SATISFIED in the woods said the Story Girl dreamily as we turned in under the lowswinging fir boughs
Trees seem such friendly things
They are the most friendly things in Gods good creation said Uncle Blair emphatically
And it is so easy to live with them
To hold converse with pines to whisper secrets with the poplars to listen to the tales of old romance that beeches have to tell to walk in eloquent silence with selfcontained firs is to learn what real companionship is
Besides trees are the same all over the world
A beech tree on the slopes of the Pyrenees is just what a beech tree here in these Carlisle woods is and there used to be an old pine hereabouts whose twin brother I was well acquainted with in a dell among the Apennines
Listen to those squirrels will you chattering over yonder
Did you ever hear such a fuss over nothing
Squirrels are the gossips and busybodies of the woods they havent learned the fine reserve of its other denizens
But after all there is a certain shrill friendliness in their greeting
They seem to be scolding us I said laughing
Oh they are not half such scolds as they sound answered Uncle Blair gaily
If they would but tak a thought and mend  their shrewlike ways they would be dear lovable creatures enough
If I had to be an animal I think Id like to be a squirrel said the Story Girl
It must be next best thing to flying
Just see what a spring that fellow gave laughed Uncle Blair
And now listen to his song of triumph
I suppose that chasm he cleared seemed as wide and deep to him as Niagara Gorge would to us if we leaped over it
Well the wood people are a happy folk and very well satisfied with themselves
Those who have followed a dim winding balsamic path to the unexpected hollow where a woodspring lies have found the rarest secret the forest can reveal
Such was our good fortune that day
At the end of our path we found it under the pines a crystal clear thing with lips unkissed by so much as a stray sunbeam
It is easy to dream that this is one of the haunted springs of old romance said Uncle Blair
Tis an enchanted spot this I am very sure and we should go softly speaking low lest we disturb the rest of a white wet naiad or break some spell that has cost long years of mystic weaving
Its so easy to believe things in the woods said the Story Girl shaping a cup from a bit of goldenbrown birch bark and filling it at the spring
Drink a toast in that water Sara said Uncle Blair
Theres not a doubt that it has some potent quality of magic in it and the wish you wish over it will come true
The Story Girl lifted her goldenhued flagon to her red lips
Her hazel eyes laughed at us over the brim
Heres to our futures she cried I wish that every day of our lives may be better than the one that went before
An extravagant wisha very wish of youth commented Uncle Blair and yet in spite of its extravagance a wish that will come true if you are true to yourselves
In that case every day WILL be better than all that went beforebut there will be many days dear lad and lass when you will not believe it
We did not understand him but we knew Uncle Blair never explained his meaning
When asked it he was wont to answer with a smile Some day youll grow to it
Wait for that
So we addressed ourselves to follow the brook that stole away from the spring in its windings and doublings and tricky surprises
A brook quoth Uncle Blair is the most changeful bewitching lovable thing in the world
It is never in the same mind or mood two minutes
Here it is sighing and murmuring as if its heart were broken
But listenyonder by the birches it is laughing as if it were enjoying some capital joke all by itself
It was indeed a changeful brook here it would make a pool dark and brooding and still where we bent to look at our mirrored faces then it grew communicative and gossiped shallowly over a broken pebble bed where there was a diamond dance of sunbeams and no troutling or minnow could glide through without being seen
Sometimes its banks were high and steep hung with slender ashes and birches again they were mere low margins green with delicate mosses shelving out of the wood
Once it came to a little precipice and flung itself over undauntedly in an indignation of foam gathering itself up rather dizzily among the mossy stones below
It was some time before it got over its vexation it went boiling and muttering along fighting with the rotten logs that lie across it and making far more fuss than was necessary over every root that interfered with it
We were getting tired of its illhumour and talked of leaving it when it suddenly grew sweettempered again swooped around a curveand presto we were in fairyland
It was a little dell far in the heart of the woods
A row of birches fringed the brook and each birch seemed more exquisitely graceful and golden than her sisters
The woods receded from it on every hand leaving it lying in a pool of amber sunshine
The yellow trees were mirrored in the placid stream with now and then a leaf falling on the water mayhap to drift away and be used as Uncle Blair suggested by some adventurous wood sprite who had it in mind to fare forth to some faroff legendary region where all the brooks ran into the sea
Oh what a lovely place
I exclaimed looking around me with delight
A spell of eternity is woven over it surely murmured Uncle Blair
Winter may not touch it or spring ever revisit it
It should be like this for ever
Let us never come here again said the Story Girl softly never no matter how often we may be in Carlisle
Then we will never see it changed or different
We can always remember it just as we see it now and it will be like this for ever for us
Im going to sketch it said Uncle Blair
While he sketched it the Story Girl and I sat on the banks of the brook and she told me the story of the Sighing Reed
It was a very simple little story that of the slender brown reed which grew by the forest pool and always was sad and sighing because it could not utter music like the brook and the birds and the winds
All the bright beautiful things around it mocked it and laughed at it for its folly
Who would ever look for music in it a plain brown unbeautiful thing
But one day a youth came through the wood he was as beautiful as the spring he cut the brown reed and fashioned it according to his liking and then he put it to his lips and breathed on it and oh the music that floated through the forest
It was so entrancing that everythingbrooks and birds and windsgrew silent to listen to it
Never had anything so lovely been heard it was the music that had for so long been shut up in the soul of the sighing reed and was set free at last through its pain and suffering
I had heard the Story Girl tell many a more dramatic tale but that one stands out for me in memory above them all partly perhaps because of the spot in which she told it partly because it was the last one I was to hear her tell for many yearsthe last one she was ever to tell me on the golden road
When Uncle Blair had finished his sketch the shafts of sunshine were turning crimson and growing more and more remote the early autumn twilight was falling over the woods
We left our dell saying goodbye to it for ever as the Story Girl had suggested and we went slowly homeward through the fir woods where a haunting indescribable odour stole out to meet us
There is magic in the scent of dying fir Uncle Blair was saying aloud to himself as if forgetting he was not quite alone
It gets into our blood like some rare subtlycompounded wine and thrills us with unutterable sweetnesses as of recollections from some other fairer life lived in some happier star
Compared to it all other scents seem heavy and earthborn luring to the valleys instead of the heights
But the tang of the fir summons onward and upward to some faroff divine eventsome spiritual peak of attainment whence we shall see with unfaltering unclouded vision the spires of some aerial City Beautiful or the fulfilment of some fair fadeless land of promise
He was silent for a moment then added in a lower tone Felicity you loved the scent of dying fir
If you were here tonight with meFelicityFelicity
Something in his voice made me suddenly sad
I was comforted when I felt the Story Girl slip her hand into mine
So we walked out of the woods into the autumn dusk
We were in a little valley
Halfway up the opposite slope a brush fire was burning clearly and steadily in a maple grove
There was something indescribably alluring in that fire glowing so redly against the dark background of forest and twilit hill
Let us go to it cried Uncle Blair gaily casting aside his sorrowful mood and catching our hands
A wood fire at night has a fascination not to be resisted by those of mortal race
Hasten we must not lose time
Oh it will burn a long time yet I gasped for Uncle Blair was whisking us up the hill at a merciless rate
You cant be sure
It may have been lighted by some good honest farmerman bent on tidying up his sugar orchard but it may also for anything we know have been kindled by no earthly woodman as a beacon or summons to the tribes of fairyland and may vanish away if we tarry
It did not vanish and presently we found ourselves in the grove
It was very beautiful the fire burned with a clear steady glow and a soft crackle the long arcades beneath the trees were illuminated with a rosy radiance beyond which lurked companies of gray and purple shadows
Everything was very still and dreamy and remote
It is impossible that out there just over the hill lies a village of men where tame household lamps are shining said Uncle Blair
I feel as if we must be thousands of miles away from everything weve ever known murmured the Story Girl
So you are
said Uncle Blair emphatically
Youre back in the youth of the raceback in the beguilement of the young world
Everything is in this hourthe beauty of classic myths the primal charm of the silent and the open the lure of mystery
Why its a time and place when and where everything might come truewhen the men in green might creep out to join hands and dance around the fire or dryads steal from their trees to warm their white limbs grown chilly in October frosts by the blaze
I wouldnt be much surprised if we should see something of the kind
Isnt that the flash of an ivory shoulder through yonder gloom
And didnt you see a queer little elfin face peering at us around that twisted gray trunk
But one cant be sure
Mortal eyesight is too slow and clumsy a thing to match against the flicker of a pixylitten fire
Hand in hand we wandered through that enchanted place seeking the folk of elfland and heard their mystic voices calling from fairy knoll and haunted hill
Not till the fire died down into ashes did we leave the grove
Then we found that the full moon was gleaming lustrously from a cloudless sky across the valley
Between us and her stretched up a tall pine wondrously straight and slender and branchless to its very top where it overflowed in a crest of dark boughs against the silvery splendour behind it
Beyond the hill farms were lying in a suave white radiance
Doesnt it seem a long long time to you since we left home this afternoon
asked the Story Girl
And yet it is only a few hours
Only a few hourstrue yet such hours were worth a cycle of common years untouched by the glory and the dream
CHAPTER XXIX WE LOSE A FRIEND Our beautiful October was marred by one day of black tragedythe day Paddy died
For Paddy after seven years of as happy a life as ever a cat lived died suddenlyof poison as was supposed
Where he had wandered in the darkness to meet his doom we did not know but in the frosty dawnlight he dragged himself home to die
We found him lying on the doorstep when we got up and it did not need Aunt Janets curt announcement or Uncle Blairs reluctant shake of the head to tell us that there was no chance of our pet recovering this time
We felt that nothing could be done
Lard and sulphur on his paws would be of no use nor would any visit to Peg Bowen avail
We stood around in mournful silence the Story Girl sat down on the step and took poor Paddy upon her lap
I spose theres no use even in praying now said Cecily desperately
It wouldnt do any harm to try sobbed Felicity
You neednt waste your prayers said Dan mournfully Pat is beyond human aid
You can tell that by his eyes
Besides I dont believe it was the praying cured him last time
No it was Peg Bowen declared Peter but she couldnt have bewitched him this time for shes been away for months nobody knows where
If he could only TELL us where he feels the worst
said Cecily piteously
Its so dreadful to see him suffering and not be able to do a single thing to help him
I dont think hes suffering much now I said comfortingly
The Story Girl said nothing
She passed and repassed her long brown hand gently over her pets glossy fur
Pat lifted his head and essayed to creep a little nearer to his beloved mistress
The Story Girl drew his limp body close in her arms
There was a plaintive little mewa long quiverand Paddys friendly soul had fared forth to wherever it is that good cats go
Well hes gone said Dan turning his back abruptly to us
It doesnt seem as if it can be true sobbed Cecily
This time yesterday morning he was full of life
He drank two full saucers of cream moaned Felicity and I saw him catch a mouse in the evening
Maybe it was the last one he ever caught
He did for many a mouse in his day said Peter anxious to pay his tribute to the departed
He was a cattake him for all in all
We shall not look upon his like again quoted Uncle Blair
Felicity and Cecily and Sara Ray cried so much that Aunt Janet lost patience completely and told them sharply that they would have something to cry for some daywhich did not seem to comfort them much
The Story Girl shed no tears though the look in her eyes hurt more than weeping
After all perhaps its for the best she said drearily
Ive been feeling so badly over having to go away and leave Paddy
No matter how kind youd all be to him I know hed miss me terribly
He wasnt like most cats who dont care who comes and goes as long as they get plenty to eat
Paddy wouldnt have been contented without me
Oh nooo oh nooo wailed Sara Ray lugubriously
Felix shot a disgusted glance at her
I dont see what YOU are making such a fuss about he said unfeelingly
He wasnt your cat
But I lloved him sobbed Sara and I always feel bad when my friends ddo
I wish we could believe that cats went to heaven like people sighed Cecily
Do you really think it isnt possible
Uncle Blair shook his head
Im afraid not
Id like to think cats have a chance for heaven but I cant
Theres nothing heavenly about cats delightful creatures though they are
Blair Im really surprised to hear the things you say to the children said Aunt Janet severely
Surely you wouldnt prefer me to tell them that cats DO go to heaven protested Uncle Blair
I think its wicked to carry on about an animal as those children do answered Aunt Janet decidedly and you shouldnt encourage them
Here now children stop making a fuss
Bury that cat and get off to your apple picking
We had to go to our work but Paddy was not to be buried in any such offhand fashion as that
It was agreed that we should bury him in the orchard at sunset that evening and Sara Ray who had to go home declared she would be back for it and implored us to wait for her if she didnt come exactly on time
I maynt be able to get away till after milking she sniffed but I dont want to miss it
Even a cats funeral is better than none at all
Horrid thing
said Felicity barely waiting until Sara was out of earshot
We worked with heavy hearts that day the girls cried bitterly most of the time and we boys whistled defiantly
But as evening drew on we began to feel a sneaking interest in the details of the funeral
As Dan said the thing should be done properly since Paddy was no common cat
The Story Girl selected the spot for the grave in a little corner behind the cherry copse where early violets enskied the grass in spring and we boys dug the grave making it soft and narrow as the heroine of the old ballad wanted hers made
Sara Ray who managed to come in time after all and Felicity stood and watched us but Cecily and the Story Girl kept far aloof
This time last night you never thought youd be digging Pats grave tonight sighed Felicity
We little kknow what a day will bring forth sobbed Sara
Ive heard the minister say that and it is true
Of course its true
Its in the Bible but I dont think you should repeat it in connection with a cat said Felicity dubiously
When all was in readiness the Story Girl brought her pet through the orchard where he had so often frisked and prowled
No useless coffin enclosed his breast but he reposed in a neat cardboard box
I wonder if it would be right to say ashes to ashes and dust to dust said Peter
No it wouldnt averred Felicity
It would be real wicked
I think we ought to sing a hymn anyway asseverated Sara Ray
Well we might do that if it isnt a very religious one conceded Felicity
How would Pull for the shore sailor pull for the shore do
asked Cecily
That never seemed to me a very religious hymn
But it doesnt seem very appropriate to a funeral occasion either said Felicity
I think Lead kindly light would be ever so much more suitable suggested Sara Ray and it is kind of soothing and melancholy too
We are not going to sing anything said the Story Girl coldly
Do you want to make the affair ridiculous
We will just fill up the grave quietly and put a flat stone over the top
It isnt much like my idea of a funeral muttered Sara Ray discontentedly
Never mind were going to have a real obituary about him in Our Magazine whispered Cecily consolingly
And Peter is going to cut his name on top of the stone added Felicity
Only we mustnt let on to the grownups until it is done because they might say it wasnt right
We left the orchard a sober little band with the wind of the gray twilight blowing round us
Uncle Roger passed us at the gate
So the last sad obsequies are over
he remarked with a grin
And we hated Uncle Roger
But we loved Uncle Blair because he said quietly And so youve buried your little comrade
So much may depend on the way a thing is said
But not even Uncle Blairs sympathy could take the sting out of the fact that there was no Paddy to get the froth that night at milking time
Felicity cried bitterly all the time she was straining the milk
Many human beings have gone to their graves unattended by as much real regret as followed that one gray pussy cat to his
CHAPTER XXX PROPHECIES Heres a letter for you from father said Felix tossing it to me as he came through the orchard gate
We had been picking apples all day but were taking a midafternoon rest around the well with a cup of its sparkling cold water to refresh us
I opened the letter rather indifferently for father with all his excellent and lovable traits was but a poor correspondent his letters were usually very brief and very unimportant
This letter was brief enough but it was freighted with a message of weighty import
I sat gazing stupidly at the sheet after I had read it until Felix exclaimed Bev whats the matter with you
Whats in that letter
Father is coming home I said dazedly
He is to leave South America in a fortnight and will be here in November to take us back to Toronto
Everybody gasped
Sara Ray of course began to cry which aggravated me unreasonably
Well said Felix when he got his second wind Ill be awful glad to see father again but I tell you I dont like the thought of leaving here
I felt exactly the same but in view of Sara Rays tears admit it I would not so I sat in grum silence while the other tongues wagged
If I were not going away myself Id feel just terrible said the Story Girl
Even as it is Im real sorry
Id like to be able to think of you as all here together when Im gone having good times and writing me about them
Itll be awfully dull when you fellows go muttered Dan
Im sure I dont know what were ever going to do here this winter said Felicity with the calmness of despair
Thank goodness there are no more fathers to come back breathed Cecily with a vicious earnestness that made us all laugh even in the midst of our dismay
We worked very halfheartedly the rest of the day and it was not until we assembled in the orchard in the evening that our spirits recovered something like their wonted level
It was clear and slightly frosty the sun had declined behind a birch on a distant hill and it seemed a tree with a blazing heart of fire
The great golden willow at the lane gate was laughtershaken in the wind of evening
Even amid all the changes of our shifting world we could not be hopelessly lowspiritedexcept Sara Ray who was often so and Peter who was rarely so
But Peter had been sorely vexed in spirit for several days
The time was approaching for the October issue of Our Magazine and he had no genuine fiction ready for it
He had taken so much to heart Felicitys taunt that his stories were all true that he had determined to have a reallytruly false one in the next number
But the difficulty was to get anyone to write it
He had asked the Story Girl to do it but she refused then he appealed to me and I shirked
Finally Peter determined to write a story himself
It oughtnt to be any harder than writing a poem and I managed that he said dolefully
He worked at it in the evenings in the granary loft and the rest of us forebore to question him concerning it because he evidently disliked talking about his literary efforts
But this evening I had to ask him if he would soon have it ready as I wanted to make up the paper
Its done said Peter with an air of gloomy triumph
It dont amount to much but anyhow I made it all out of my own head
Not one word of it was ever printed or told before and nobody can say there was
Then I guess we have all the stuff in and Ill have Our Magazine ready to read by tomorrow night I said
I spose it will be the last one well have sighed Cecily
We cant carry it on after you all go and it has been such fun
Bev will be a real newspaper editor some day declared the Story Girl on whom the spirit of prophecy suddenly descended that night
She was swinging on the bough of an apple tree with a crimson shawl wrapped about her head and her eyes were bright with roguish fire
How do you know he will
asked Felicity
Oh I can tell futures answered the Story Girl mysteriously
I know whats going to happen to all of you
Shall I tell you
Do just for the fun of it I said
Then some day well know just how near you came to guessing right
Go on
What else about me
Youll write books too and travel all over the world continued the Story Girl
Felix will be fat to the end of his life and he will be a grandfather before he is fifty and he will wear a long black beard
I wont cried Felix disgustedly
I hate whiskers
Maybe I cant help the grandfather part but I CAN help having a beard
You cant
Its written in the stars
Taint
The stars cant prevent me from shaving
Wont Grandpa Felix sound awful funny
reflected Felicity
Peter will be a minister went on the Story Girl
Well I might be something worse remarked Peter in a not ungratified tone
Dan will be a farmer and will marry a girl whose name begins with K and he will have eleven children
And hell vote Grit
I wont cried scandalized Dan
You dont know a thing about it
Catch ME ever voting Grit
As for the rest of itI dont care
Farmings well enough though Id rather be a sailor
Dont talk such nonsense protested Felicity sharply
What on earth do you want to be a sailor for and be drowned
All sailors arent drowned said Dan
Most of them are
Look at Uncle Stephen
You aint sure he was drowned
Well he disappeared and that is worse
How do you know
Disappearing might be real easy
Its not very easy for your family
Hush lets hear the rest of the predictions said Cecily
Felicity resumed the Story Girl gravely will marry a minister
Sara Ray giggled and Felicity blushed
Peter tried hard not to look too selfconsciously delighted
She will be a perfect housekeeper and will teach a Sunday School class and be very happy all her life
Will her husband be happy
queried Dan solemnly
I guess hell be as happy as your wife retorted Felicity reddening
Hell be the happiest man in the world declared Peter warmly
What about me
asked Sara Ray
The Story Girl looked rather puzzled
It was so hard to imagine Sara Ray as having any kind of future
Yet Sara was plainly anxious to have her fortune told and must be gratified
Youll be married said the Story Girl recklessly and youll live to be nearly a hundred years old and go to dozens of funerals and have a great many sick spells
You will learn not to cry after you are seventy but your husband will never go to church
Im glad you warned me said Sara Ray solemnly because now I know Ill make him promise before I marry him that he will go
He wont keep the promise said the Story Girl shaking her head
But it is getting cold and Cecily is coughing
Let us go in
You havent told my fortune protested Cecily disappointedly
The Story Girl looked very tenderly at Cecilyat the smooth little brown head at the soft shining eyes at the cheeks that were often overrosy after slight exertion at the little sunburned hands that were always busy doing faithful work or quiet kindnesses
A very strange look came over the Story Girls face her eyes grew sad and farreaching as if of a verity they pierced beyond the mists of hidden years
I couldnt tell any fortune half good enough for you dearest she said slipping her arm round Cecily
You deserve everything good and lovely
But you know Ive only been in funof course I dont know anything about whats going to happen to us
Perhaps you know more than you think for said Sara Ray who seemed much pleased with her fortune and anxious to believe it despite the husband who wouldnt go to church
But Id like to be told my fortune even in fun persisted Cecily
Everybody you meet will love you as long as you live
said the Story Girl
There thats the very nicest fortune I can tell you and it will come true whether the others do or not and now we must go in
We went Cecily still a little disappointed
In later years I often wondered why the Story Girl refused to tell her fortune that night
Did some strange gleam of foreknowledge fall for a moment across her mirthmaking
Did she realize in a flash of prescience that there was no earthly future for our sweet Cecily
Not for her were to be the lengthening shadows or the fading garland
The end was to come while the rainbow still sparkled on her wine of life ere a single petal had fallen from her rose of joy
Long life was before all the others who trysted that night in the old homestead orchard but Cecilys maiden feet were never to leave the golden road
CHAPTER XXXI THE LAST NUMBER OF OUR MAGAZINE EDITORIAL It is with heartfelt regret that we take up our pen to announce that this will be the last number of Our Magazine
We have edited ten numbers of it and it has been successful beyond our expectations
It has to be discontinued by reason of circumstances over which we have no control and not because we have lost interest in it
Everybody has done his or her best for Our Magazine
Prince Edward Island expected everyone to do his and her duty and everyone did it
Mr Dan King conducted the etiquette department in a way worthy of the Family Guide itself
He is especially entitled to commendation because he laboured under the disadvantage of having to furnish most of the questions as well as the answers
Miss Felicity King has edited our helpful household department very ably and Miss Cecily Kings fashion notes were always up to date
The personal column was well looked after by Miss Sara Stanley and the story page has been a marked success under the able management of Mr Peter Craig to whose original story in this issue The Battle of the Partridge Eggs we would call especial attention
The Exciting Adventure series has also been very popular
And now in closing we bid farewell to our staff and thank them one and all for their help and cooperation in the past year
We have enjoyed our work and we trust that they have too
We wish them all happiness and success in years to come and we hope that the recollection of Our Magazine will not be held least dear among the memories of their childhood
SOBS FROM THE GIRLS INDEED IT WONT
OBITUARY On October eighteenth Patrick Grayfur departed for that bourne whence no traveller returns
He was only a cat but he had been our faithful friend for a long time and we arent ashamed to be sorry for him
There are lots of people who are not as friendly and gentlemanly as Paddy was and he was a great mouser
We buried all that was mortal of poor Pat in the orchard and we are never going to forget him
We have resolved that whenever the date of his death comes round well bow our heads and pronounce his name at the hour of his funeral
If we are anywhere where we cant say the name out loud well whisper it
Farewell dearest Paddy in all the years that are to be Well cherish your memory faithfully
1 1 The obituary was written by Mr Felix King but the two lines of poetry were composed by Miss Sara Ray
MY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE My most exciting adventure was the day I fell off Uncle Rogers loft two years ago
I wasnt excited until it was all over because I hadnt time to be
The Story Girl and I were looking for eggs in the loft
It was filled with wheat straw nearly to the roof and it was an awful distance from us to the floor
And wheat straw is so slippery
I made a little spring and the straw slipped from under my feet and there I was going head first down from the loft
It seemed to me I was an awful long time falling but the Story Girl says I couldnt have been more than three seconds
But I know that I thought five thoughts and there seemed to be quite a long time between them
The first thing I thought was what has happened because I really didnt know at first it was so sudden
Then after a spell I thought the answer I am falling off the loft
And then I thought what will happen to me when I strike the floor and after another little spell I thought Ill be killed
And then I thought well I dont care
I really wasnt a bit frightened
I just was quite willing to be killed
If there hadnt been a big pile of chaff on the barn floor these words would never have been written
But there was and I fell on it and wasnt a bit hurt only my hair and mouth and eyes and ears got all full of chaff
The strange part is that I wasnt a bit frightened when I thought I was going to be killed but after all the danger was over I was awfully frightened and trembled so the Story Girl had to help me into the house
FELICITY KING
THE BATTLE OF THE PARTRIDGE EGGS Once upon a time there lived about half a mile from a forrest a farmer and his wife and his sons and daughters and a granddaughter
The farmer and his wife loved this little girl very much but she caused them great trouble by running away into the woods and they often spent haf days looking for her
One day she wondered further into the forrest than usual and she begun to be hungry
Then night closed in
She asked a fox where she could get something to eat
The fox told her he knew where there was a partridges nest and a bluejays nest full of eggs
So he led her to the nests and she took five eggs out of each
When the birds came home they missed the eggs and flew into a rage
The bluejay put on his topcoat and was going to the partridge for law when he met the partridge coming to him
They lit up a fire and commenced sining their deeds when they heard a tremendous howl close behind them
They jumped up and put out the fire and were immejutly attacked by five great wolves
The next day the little girl was rambelling through the woods when they saw her and took her prisoner
After she had confessed that she had stole the eggs they told her to raise an army
They would have to fight over the nests of eggs and whoever one would have the eggs
So the partridge raised a great army of all kinds of birds except robins and the little girl got all the robins and foxes and bees and wasps
And best of all the little girl had a gun and plenty of ammunishun
The leader of her army was a wolf
The result of the battle was that all the birds were killed except the partridge and the bluejay and they were taken prisoner and starved to death
The little girl was then taken prisoner by a witch and cast into a dunjun full of snakes where she died from their bites and people who went through the forrest after that were taken prisoner by her ghost and cast into the same dunjun where they died
About a year after the wood turned into a gold castle and one morning everything had vanished except a piece of a tree
PETER CRAIG
DAN WITH A WHISTLEWell I guess nobody can say Peter cant write fiction after THAT
SARA RAY WIPING AWAY HER TEARSIts a very interesting story but it ends SO sadly
FELIXWhat made you call it The Battle of the Partridge Eggs when the bluejay had just as much to do with it
PETER SHORTLYBecause it sounded better that way
FELICITYDid she eat the eggs raw
SARA RAYPoor little thing I suppose if youre starving you cant be very particular
CECILY SIGHINGI wish youd let her go home safe Peter and not put her to such a cruel death
BEVERLEYI dont quite understand where the little girl got her gun and ammunition
PETER SUSPECTING THAT HE IS BEING MADE FUN OFIf you could write a better story why didnt you
I give you the chance
THE STORY GIRL WITH A PRETERNATURALLY SOLEMN FACEYou shouldnt criticize Peters story like that
Its a fairy tale you know and anything can happen in a fairy tale
FELICITYThere isnt a word about fairies in it
CECILYBesides fairy tales always end nicely and this doesnt
PETER SULKILYI wanted to punish her for running away from home
DANWell I guess you did it all right
CECILYOh well it was very interesting and that is all that is really necessary in a story

CHAPTER XXXII OUR LAST EVENING TOGETHER IT was the evening before the day on which the Story Girl and Uncle Blair were to leave us and we were keeping our last tryst together in the orchard where we had spent so many happy hours
We had made a pilgrimage to all the old hauntsthe hill field the spruce wood the dairy Grandfather Kings willow the Pulpit Stone Pats grave and Uncle Stephens Walk and now we foregathered in the sere grasses about the old well and feasted on the little jam turnovers Felicity had made that day specially for the occasion
I wonder if well ever all be together again sighed Cecily
I wonder when Ill get jam turnovers like this again said the Story Girl trying to be gay but not making much of a success of it
If Paris wasnt so far away I could send you a box of nice things now and then said Felicity forlornly but I suppose theres no use thinking of that
Dear knows what theyll give you to eat over there
Oh the French have the reputation of being the best cooks in the world rejoined the Story Girl but I know they cant beat your jam turnovers and plum puffs Felicity
Many a time Ill be hankering after them
If we ever do meet again youll be grown up said Felicity gloomily
Well you wont have stood still yourselves you know
No but thats just the worst of it
Well all be different and everything will be changed
Just think said Cecily last New Years Eve we were wondering what would happen this year and what a lot of things have happened that we never expected
Oh dear
If things never happened life would be pretty dull said the Story Girl briskly
Oh dont look so dismal all of you
Its hard to be cheerful when everybodys going away sighed Cecily
Well lets pretend to be anyway insisted the Story Girl
Dont lets think of parting
Lets think instead of how much weve laughed this last year or so
Im sure I shall never forget this dear old place
Weve had so many good times here
And some bad times too reminded Felix
Remember when Dan et the bad berries last summer
And the time we were so scared over that bell ringing in the house grinned Peter
And the Judgment Day added Dan
And the time Paddy was bewitched suggested Sara Ray
And when Peter was dying of the measles said Felicity
And the time Jimmy Patterson was lost said Dan
Geewhiz but that scared me out of a years growth
Do you remember the time we took the magic seed grinned Peter
Werent we silly
said Felicity
I really can never look Billy Robinson in the face when I meet him
Im always sure hes laughing at me in his sleeve
Its Billy Robinson who ought to be ashamed when he meets you or any of us commented Cecily severely
Id rather be cheated than cheat other people
Do you mind the time we bought Gods picture
asked Peter
I wonder if its where we buried it yet speculated Felix
I put a stone over it just as we did over Pat said Cecily
I wish I could forget what God looks like sighed Sara Ray
I cant forget itand I cant forget what the bad place is like either ever since Peter preached that sermon on it
When you get to be a real minister youll have to preach that sermon over again Peter grinned Dan
My Aunt Jane used to say that people needed a sermon on that place once in a while retorted Peter seriously
Do you mind the night I et the cucumbers and milk to make me dream
said Cecily
And therewith we hunted out our old dream books to read them again and forgetful of coming partings laughed over them till the old orchard echoed to our mirth
When we had finished we stood in a circle around the well and pledged eternal friendship in a cup of its unrivalled water
Then we joined hands and sang Auld Lang Syne
Sara Ray cried bitterly in lieu of singing
Look here said the Story Girl as we turned to leave the old orchard I want to ask a favour of you all
Dont say goodbye to me tomorrow morning
Why not
demanded Felicity in astonishment
Because its such a hopeless sort of word
Dont lets SAY it at all
Just see me off with a wave of your hands
It wont seem half so bad then
And dont any of you cry if you can help it
I want to remember you all smiling
We went out of the old orchard where the autumn night wind was beginning to make its weird music in the russet boughs and shut the little gate behind us
Our revels there were ended
CHAPTER XXXIII THE STORY GIRL GOES The morning dawned rosy and clear and frosty
Everybody was up early for the travellers must leave in time to catch the nine oclock train
The horse was harnessed and Uncle Alec was waiting by the door
Aunt Janet was crying but everybody else was making a valiant effort not to
The Awkward Man and Mrs Dale came to see the last of their favourite
Mrs Dale had brought her a glorious sheaf of chrysanthemums and the Awkward Man gave her quite gracefully another little old limp book from his library
Read it when you are sad or happy or lonely or discouraged or hopeful he said gravely
He has really improved very much since he got married whispered Felicity to me
Sara Stanley wore a smart new travelling suit and a blue felt hat with a white feather
She looked so horribly grown up in it that we felt as if she were lost to us already
Sara Ray had vowed tearfully the night before that she would be up in the morning to say farewell
But at this juncture Judy Pineau appeared to say that Sara with her usual luck had a sore throat and that her mother consequently would not permit her to come
So Sara had written her parting words in a threecornered pink note
My OWN DARLING FRIENDWORDS CANNOT EXPRESS my feelings over not being able to go up this morning to say goodbye to one I so FONDLY ADORE
When I think that I cannot SEE YOU AGAIN my heart is almost TOO FULL FOR UTTERANCE
But mother says I cannot and I MUST OBEY
But I will be present IN SPIRIT
It just BREAKS MY HEART that you are going SO FAR AWAY
You have always been SO KIND to me and never hurt my feelings AS SOME DO and I shall miss you SO MUCH
But I earnestly HOPE AND PRAY that you will be HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS wherever YOUR LOT IS CAST and not be seasick on THE GREAT OCEAN
I hope you will find time AMONG YOUR MANY DUTIES to write me a letter ONCE IN A WHILE
I shall ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU and please remember me
I hope we WILL MEET AGAIN sometime but if not may we meet in A FAR BETTER WORLD where there are no SAD PARTINGS
Your true and loving friend SARA RAY Poor little Sara said the Story Girl with a queer catch in her voice as she slipped the tearblotted note into her pocket
She isnt a bad little soul and Im sorry I couldnt see her once more though maybe its just as well for shed have to cry and set us all off
I WONT cry
Felicity dont you dare
Oh you dear darling people I love you all so much and Ill go on loving you always
Mind you write us every week at the very least said Felicity winking furiously
Blair Blair watch over the child well said Aunt Janet
Remember she has no mother
The Story Girl ran over to the buggy and climbed in
Uncle Blair followed her
Her arms were full of Mrs Dales chrysanthemums held close up to her face and her beautiful eyes shone softly at us over them
No goodbyes were said as she wished
We all smiled bravely and waved our hands as they drove out of the lane and down the moist red road into the shadows of the fir wood in the valley
But we still stood there for we knew we should see the Story Girl once more
Beyond the fir wood was an open curve in the road and she had promised to wave a last farewell as they passed around it
We watched the curve in silence standing in a sorrowful little group in the sunshine of the autumn morning
The delight of the world had been ours on the golden road
It had enticed us with daisies and rewarded us with roses
Blossom and lyric had waited on our wishes
Thoughts careless and sweet had visited us
Laughter had been our comrade and fearless Hope our guide
But now the shadow of change was over it
There she is cried Felicity
The Story Girl stood up and waved her chrysanthemums at us
We waved wildly back until the buggy had driven around the curve
Then we went slowly and silently back to the house
The Story Girl was gone
