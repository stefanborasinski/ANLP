And it would be rather worth while to own the most romantic house in Brittany
The present people are dead broke and its going for a songyou ought to buy it
It was not with the least idea of living up to the character my friend Lanrivain ascribed to me as a matter of fact under my unsociable exterior I have always had secret yearnings for domesticity that I took his hint one autumn afternoon and went to Kerfol
My friend was motoring over to Quimper on business he dropped me on the way at a crossroad on a heath and said First turn to the right and second to the left
Then straight ahead till you see an avenue
If you meet any peasants dont ask your way
They dont understand French and they would pretend they did and mix you up
Ill be back for you here by sunsetand dont forget the tombs in the chapel
I followed Lanrivains directions with the hesitation occasioned by the usual difficulty of remembering whether he had said the first turn to the right and second to the left or the contrary
If I had met a peasant I should certainly have asked and probably been sent astray but I had the desert landscape to myself and so stumbled on the right turn and walked on across the heath till I came to an avenue
It was so unlike any other avenue I have ever seen that I instantly knew it must be THE avenue
The greytrunked trees sprang up straight to a great height and then interwove their palegrey branches in a long tunnel through which the autumn light fell faintly
I know most trees by name but I havent to this day been able to decide what those trees were
They had the tall curve of elms the tenuity of poplars the ashen colour of olives under a rainy sky and they stretched ahead of me for half a mile or more without a break in their arch
If ever I saw an avenue that unmistakeably led to something it was the avenue at Kerfol
My heart beat a little as I began to walk down it
Presently the trees ended and I came to a fortified gate in a long wall
Between me and the wall was an open space of grass with other grey avenues radiating from it
Behind the wall were tall slate roofs mossed with silver a chapel belfry the top of a keep
A moat filled with wild shrubs and brambles surrounded the place the drawbridge had been replaced by a stone arch and the portcullis by an iron gate
I stood for a long time on the hither side of the moat gazing about me and letting the influence of the place sink in
I said to myself If I wait long enough the guardian will turn up and show me the tombs and I rather hoped he wouldnt turn up too soon
I sat down on a stone and lit a cigarette
As soon as I had done it it struck me as a puerile and portentous thing to do with that great blind house looking down at me and all the empty avenues converging on me
It may have been the depth of the silence that made me so conscious of my gesture
The squeak of my match sounded as loud as the scraping of a brake and I almost fancied I heard it fall when I tossed it onto the grass
But there was more than that a sense of irrelevance of littleness of childish bravado in sitting there puffing my cigarettesmoke into the face of such a past
I knew nothing of the history of KerfolI was new to Brittany and Lanrivain had never mentioned the name to me till the day beforebut one couldnt as much as glance at that pile without feeling in it a long accumulation of history
What kind of history I was not prepared to guess perhaps only the sheer weight of many associated lives and deaths which gives a kind of majesty to all old houses
But the aspect of Kerfol suggested something morea perspective of stern and cruel memories stretching away like its own grey avenues into a blur of darkness
Certainly no house had ever more completely and finally broken with the present
As it stood there lifting its proud roofs and gables to the sky it might have been its own funeral monument
Tombs in the chapel
The whole place is a tomb
I reflected
I hoped more and more that the guardian would not come
The details of the place however striking would seem trivial compared with its collective impressiveness and I wanted only to sit there and be penetrated by the weight of its silence
Its the very place for you
Lanrivain had said and I was overcome by the almost blasphemous frivolity of suggesting to any living being that Kerfol was the place for him
Is it possible that any one could NOT see
I wondered
I did not finish the thought what I meant was undefinable
I stood up and wandered toward the gate
I was beginning to want to know more not to SEE moreI was by now so sure it was not a question of seeing but to feel more feel all the place had to communicate
But to get in one will have to rout out the keeper I thought reluctantly and hesitated
Finally I crossed the bridge and tried the iron gate
It yielded and I walked under the tunnel formed by the thickness of the chemin de ronde
At the farther end a wooden barricade had been laid across the entrance and beyond it I saw a court enclosed in noble architecture
The main building faced me and I now discovered that one half was a mere ruined front with gaping windows through which the wild growths of the moat and the trees of the park were visible
The rest of the house was still in its robust beauty
One end abutted on the round tower the other on the small traceried chapel and in an angle of the building stood a graceful wellhead adorned with mossy urns
A few roses grew against the walls and on an upper windowsill I remember noticing a pot of fuchsias
My sense of the pressure of the invisible began to yield to my architectural interest
The building was so fine that I felt a desire to explore it for its own sake
I looked about the court wondering in which corner the guardian lodged
Then I pushed open the barrier and went in
As I did so a little dog barred my way
He was such a remarkably beautiful little dog that for a moment he made me forget the splendid place he was defending
I was not sure of his breed at the time but have since learned that it was Chinese and that he was of a rare variety called the Sleevedog
He was very small and golden brown with large brown eyes and a ruffled throat he looked rather like a large tawny chrysanthemum
I said to myself These little beasts always snap and scream and somebody will be out in a minute
The little animal stood before me forbidding almost menacing there was anger in his large brown eyes
But he made no sound he came no nearer
Instead as I advanced he gradually fell back and I noticed that another dog a vague rough brindled thing had limped up
Therell be a hubbub now I thought for at the same moment a third dog a longhaired white mongrel slipped out of a doorway and joined the others
All three stood looking at me with grave eyes but not a sound came from them
As I advanced they continued to fall back on muffled paws still watching me
At a given point theyll all charge at my ankles its one of the dodges that dogs who live together put up on one I thought
I was not much alarmed for they were neither large nor formidable
But they let me wander about the court as I pleased following me at a little distancealways the same distanceand always keeping their eyes on me
Presently I looked across at the ruined facade and saw that in one of its windowframes another dog stood a large white pointer with one brown ear
He was an old grave dog much more experienced than the others and he seemed to be observing me with a deeper intentness
Ill hear from HIM I said to myself but he stood in the empty windowframe against the trees of the park and continued to watch me without moving
I looked back at him for a time to see if the sense that he was being watched would not rouse him
Half the width of the court lay between us and we stared at each other silently across it
But he did not stir and at last I turned away
Behind me I found the rest of the pack with a newcomer added a small black greyhound with pale agatecoloured eyes
He was shivering a little and his expression was more timid than that of the others
I noticed that he kept a little behind them
And still there was not a sound
I stood there for fully five minutes the circle about me waiting as they seemed to be waiting
At last I went up to the little goldenbrown dog and stooped to pat him
As I did so I heard myself laugh
The little dog did not start or growl or take his eyes from mehe simply slipped back about a yard and then paused and continued to look at me
Oh hang it
I exclaimed aloud and walked across the court toward the well
As I advanced the dogs separated and slid away into different corners of the court
I examined the urns on the well tried a locked door or two and up and down the dumb facade then I faced about toward the chapel
When I turned I perceived that all the dogs had disappeared except the old pointer who still watched me from the empty windowframe
It was rather a relief to be rid of that cloud of witnesses and I began to look about me for a way to the back of the house
Perhaps therell be somebody in the garden I thought
I found a way across the moat scrambled over a wall smothered in brambles and got into the garden
A few lean hydrangeas and geraniums pined in the flowerbeds and the ancient house looked down on them indifferently
Its garden side was plainer and severer than the other the long granite front with its few windows and steep roof looked like a fortressprison
I walked around the farther wing went up some disjointed steps and entered the deep twilight of a narrow and incredibly old boxwalk
The walk was just wide enough for one person to slip through and its branches met overhead
It was like the ghost of a boxwalk its lustrous green all turning to the shadowy greyness of the avenues
I walked on and on the branches hitting me in the face and springing back with a dry rattle and at length I came out on the grassy top of the chemin de ronde
I walked along it to the gatetower looking down into the court which was just below me
Not a human being was in sight and neither were the dogs
I found a flight of steps in the thickness of the wall and went down them and when I emerged again into the court there stood the circle of dogs the golden brown one a little ahead of the others the black greyhound shivering in the rear
Oh hang ityou uncomfortable beasts you
I exclaimed my voice startling me with a sudden echo
The dogs stood motionless watching me
I knew by this time that they would not try to prevent my approaching the house and the knowledge left me free to examine them
I had a feeling that they must be horribly cowed to be so silent and inert
Yet they did not look hungry or illtreated
Their coats were smooth and they were not thin except the shivering greyhound
It was more as if they had lived a long time with people who never spoke to them or looked at them as though the silence of the place had gradually benumbed their busy inquisitive natures
And this strange passivity this almost human lassitude seemed to me sadder than the misery of starved and beaten animals
I should have liked to rouse them for a minute to coax them into a game or a scamper but the longer I looked into their fixed and weary eyes the more preposterous the idea became
With the windows of that house looking down on us how could I have imagined such a thing
The dogs knew better THEY knew what the house would tolerate and what it would not
I even fancied that they knew what was passing through my mind and pitied me for my frivolity
But even that feeling probably reached them through a thick fog of listlessness
I had an idea that their distance from me was as nothing to my remoteness from them
In the last analysis the impression they produced was that of having in common one memory so deep and dark that nothing that had happened since was worth either a growl or a wag
I say I broke out abruptly addressing myself to the dumb circle do you know what you look like the whole lot of you
You look as if youd seen a ghostthats how you look
I wonder if there IS a ghost here and nobody but you left for it to appear to
The dogs continued to gaze at me without moving


It was dark when I saw Lanrivains motor lamps at the cross roadsand I wasnt exactly sorry to see them
I had the sense of having escaped from the loneliest place in the whole world and of not liking lonelinessto that degreeas much as I had imagined I should
My friend had brought his solicitor back from Quimper for the night and seated beside a fat and affable stranger I felt no inclination to talk of Kerfol


But that evening when Lanrivain and the solicitor were closeted in the study Madame de Lanrivain began to question me in the drawingroom
Wellare you going to buy Kerfol
she asked tilting up her gay chin from her embroidery
I havent decided yet
The fact is I couldnt get into the house I said as if I had simply postponed my decision and meant to go back for another look
You couldnt get in
Why what happened
The family are mad to sell the place and the old guardian has orders Very likely
But the old guardian wasnt there
What a pity
He must have gone to market
But his daughter
There was nobody about
At least I saw no one
How extraordinary
Literally nobody
Nobody but a lot of dogsa whole pack of themwho seemed to have the place to themselves
Madame de Lanrivain let the embroidery slip to her knee and folded her hands on it
For several minutes she looked at me thoughtfully
A pack of dogsyou SAW them
Saw them
I saw nothing else
How many
She dropped her voice a little
Ive always wondered I looked at her with surprise I had supposed the place to be familiar to her
Have you never been to Kerfol
I asked
Oh yes often
But never on that day
What day
Id quite forgottenand so had Herve Im sure
If wed remembered we never should have sent you todaybut then after all one doesnt half believe that sort of thing does one
What sort of thing
I asked involuntarily sinking my voice to the level of hers
Inwardly I was thinking I KNEW there was something


Madame de Lanrivain cleared her throat and produced a reassuring smile
Didnt Herve tell you the story of Kerfol
An ancestor of his was mixed up in it
You know every Breton house has its ghoststory and some of them are rather unpleasant
Yesbut those dogs
I insisted
Well those dogs are the ghosts of Kerfol
At least the peasants say theres one day in the year when a lot of dogs appear there and that day the keeper and his daughter go off to Morlaix and get drunk
The women in Brittany drink dreadfully
She stooped to match a silk then she lifted her charming inquisitive Parisian face Did you REALLY see a lot of dogs
There isnt one at Kerfol she said
II Lanrivain the next day hunted out a shabby calf volume from the back of an upper shelf of his library
Yeshere it is
What does it call itself
A History of the Assizes of the Duchy of Brittany
Quimper 1702
The book was written about a hundred years later than the Kerfol affair but I believe the account is transcribed pretty literally from the judicial records
Anyhow its queer reading
And theres a Herve de Lanrivain mixed up in itnot exactly MY style as youll see
But then hes only a collateral
Here take the book up to bed with you
I dont exactly remember the details but after youve read it Ill bet anything youll leave your light burning all night
I left my light burning all night as he had predicted but it was chiefly because till near dawn I was absorbed in my reading
The account of the trial of Anne de Cornault wife of the lord of Kerfol was long and closely printed
It was as my friend had said probably an almost literal transcription of what took place in the courtroom and the trial lasted nearly a month
Besides the type of the book was detestable


At first I thought of translating the old record literally
But it is full of wearisome repetitions and the main lines of the story are forever straying off into side issues
So I have tried to disentangle it and give it here in a simpler form
At times however I have reverted to the text because no other words could have conveyed so exactly the sense of what I felt at Kerfol and nowhere have I added anything of my own
III It was in the year 16 that Yves de Cornault lord of the domain of Kerfol went to the pardon of Locronan to perform his religious duties
He was a rich and powerful noble then in his sixtysecond year but hale and sturdy a great horseman and hunter and a pious man
So all his neighbours attested
In appearance he seems to have been short and broad with a swarthy face legs slightly bowed from the saddle a hanging nose and broad hands with black hairs on them
He had married young and lost his wife and son soon after and since then had lived alone at Kerfol
Twice a year he went to Morlaix where he had a handsome house by the river and spent a week or ten days there and occasionally he rode to Rennes on business
Witnesses were found to declare that during these absences he led a life different from the one he was known to lead at Kerfol where he busied himself with his estate attended mass daily and found his only amusement in hunting the wild boar and waterfowl
But these rumours are not particularly relevant and it is certain that among people of his own class in the neighbourhood he passed for a stern and even austere man observant of his religious obligations and keeping strictly to himself
There was no talk of any familiarity with the women on his estate though at that time the nobility were very free with their peasants
Some people said he had never looked at a woman since his wifes death but such things are hard to prove and the evidence on this point was not worth much
Well in his sixtysecond year Yves de Cornault went to the pardon at Locronan and saw there a young lady of Douarnenez who had ridden over pillion behind her father to do her duty to the saint
Her name was Anne de Barrigan and she came of good old Breton stock but much less great and powerful than that of Yves de Cornault and her father had squandered his fortune at cards and lived almost like a peasant in his little granite manor on the moors


I have said I would add nothing of my own to this bald statement of a strange case but I must interrupt myself here to describe the young lady who rode up to the lychgate of Locronan at the very moment when the Baron de Cornault was also dismounting there
I take my description from a rather rare thing a faded drawing in red crayon sober and truthful enough to be by a late pupil of the Clouets which hangs in Lanrivains study and is said to be a portrait of Anne de Barrigan
It is unsigned and has no mark of identity but the initials A
B and the date 16 the year after her marriage
It represents a young woman with a small oval face almost pointed yet wide enough for a full mouth with a tender depression at the corners
The nose is small and the eyebrows are set rather high far apart and as lightly pencilled as the eyebrows in a Chinese painting
The forehead is high and serious and the hair which one feels to be fine and thick and fair drawn off it and lying close like a cap
The eyes are neither large nor small hazel probably with a look at once shy and steady
A pair of beautiful long hands are crossed below the ladys breast


The chaplain of Kerfol and other witnesses averred that when the Baron came back from Locronan he jumped from his horse ordered another to be instantly saddled called to a young page come with him and rode away that same evening to the south
His steward followed the next morning with coffers laden on a pair of pack mules
The following week Yves de Cornault rode back to Kerfol sent for his vassals and tenants and told them he was to be married at All Saints to Anne de Barrigan of Douarnenez
And on All Saints Day the marriage took place
As to the next few years the evidence on both sides seems to show that they passed happily for the couple
No one was found to say that Yves de Cornault had been unkind to his wife and it was plain to all that he was content with his bargain
Indeed it was admitted by the chaplain and other witnesses for the prosecution that the young lady had a softening influence on her husband and that he became less exacting with his tenants less harsh to peasants and dependents and less subject to the fits of gloomy silence which had darkened his widowhood
As to his wife the only grievance her champions could call up in her behalf was that Kerfol was a lonely place and that when her husband was away on business at Rennes or Morlaixwhither she was never takenshe was not allowed so much as to walk in the park unaccompanied
But no one asserted that she was unhappy though one servantwoman said she had surprised her crying and had heard her say that she was a woman accursed to have no child and nothing in life to call her own
But that was a natural enough feeling in a wife attached to her husband and certainly it must have been a great grief to Yves de Cornault that she gave him no son
Yet he never made her feel her childlessness as a reproachshe herself admits this in her evidencebut seemed to try to make her forget it by showering gifts and favours on her
Rich though he was he had never been openhanded but nothing was too fine for his wife in the way of silks or gems or linen or whatever else she fancied
Every wandering merchant was welcome at Kerfol and when the master was called away he never came back without bringing his wife a handsome presentsomething curious and particularfrom Morlaix or Rennes or Quimper
One of the waitingwomen gave in crossexamination an interesting list of one years gifts which I copy
From Morlaix a carved ivory junk with Chinamen at the oars that a strange sailor had brought back as a votive offering for Notre Dame de la Clarte above Ploumanach from Quimper an embroidered gown worked by the nuns of the Assumption from Rennes a silver rose that opened and showed an amber Virgin with a crown of garnets from Morlaix again a length of Damascus velvet shot with gold bought of a Jew from Syria and for Michaelmas that same year from Rennes a necklet or bracelet of round stonesemeralds and pearls and rubiesstrung like beads on a gold wire
This was the present that pleased the lady best the woman said
Later on as it happened it was produced at the trial and appears to have struck the Judges and the public as a curious and valuable jewel
The very same winter the Baron absented himself again this time as far as Bordeaux and on his return he brought his wife something even odder and prettier than the bracelet
It was a winter evening when he rode up to Kerfol and walking into the hall found her sitting listlessly by the fire her chin on her hand looking into the fire
He carried a velvet box in his hand and setting it down on the hearth lifted the lid and let out a little goldenbrown dog
Anne de Cornault exclaimed with pleasure as the little creature bounded toward her
Oh it looks like a bird or a butterfly
she cried as she picked it up and the dog put its paws on her shoulders and looked at her with eyes like a Christians
After that she would never have it out of her sight and petted and talked to it as if it had been a childas indeed it was the nearest thing to a child she was to know
Yves de Cornault was much pleased with his purchase
The dog had been brought to him by a sailor from an East India merchantman and the sailor had bought it of a pilgrim in a bazaar at Jaffa who had stolen it from a noblemans wife in China a perfectly permissible thing to do since the pilgrim was a Christian and the nobleman a heathen doomed to hellfire
Yves de Cornault had paid a long price for the dog for they were beginning to be in demand at the French court and the sailor knew he had got hold of a good thing but Annes pleasure was so great that to see her laugh and play with the little animal her husband would doubtless have given twice the sum
So far all the evidence is at one and the narrative plain sailing but now the steering becomes difficult
I will try to keep as nearly as possible to Annes own statements though toward the end poor thing 


Well to go back
The very year after the little brown dog was brought to Kerfol Yves de Cornault one winter night was found dead at the head of a narrow flight of stairs leading down from his wifes rooms to a door opening on the court
It was his wife who found him and gave the alarm so distracted poor wretch with fear and horrorfor his blood was all over herthat at first the roused household could not make out what she was saying and thought she had gone suddenly mad
But there sure enough at the top of the stairs lay her husband stone dead and head foremost the blood from his wounds dripping down to the steps below him
He had been dreadfully scratched and gashed about the face and throat as if with a dull weapon and one of his legs had a deep tear in it which had cut an artery and probably caused his death
But how did he come there and who had murdered him
His wife declared that she had been asleep in her bed and hearing his cry had rushed out to find him lying on the stairs but this was immediately questioned
In the first place it was proved that from her room she could not have heard the struggle on the stairs owing to the thickness of the walls and the length of the intervening passage then it was evident that she had not been in bed and asleep since she was dressed when she roused the house and her bed had not been slept in
Moreover the door at the bottom of the stairs was ajar and the key in the lock and it was noticed by the chaplain an observant man that the dress she wore was stained with blood about the knees and that there were traces of small bloodstained hands low down on the staircase walls so that it was conjectured that she had really been at the posterndoor when her husband fell and feeling her way up to him in the darkness on her hands and knees had been stained by his blood dripping down on her
Of course it was argued on the other side that the bloodmarks on her dress might have been caused by her kneeling down by her husband when she rushed out of her room but there was the open door below and the fact that the fingermarks in the staircase all pointed upward
The accused held to her statement for the first two days in spite of its improbability but on the third day word was brought to her that Herve de Lanrivain a young nobleman of the neighbourhood had been arrested for complicity in the crime
Two or three witnesses thereupon came forward to say that it was known throughout the country that Lanrivain had formerly been on good terms with the lady of Cornault but that he had been absent from Brittany for over a year and people had ceased to associate their names
The witnesses who made this statement were not of a very reputable sort
One was an old herbgatherer suspected of witchcraft another a drunken clerk from a neighbouring parish the third a halfwitted shepherd who could be made to say anything and it was clear that the prosecution was not satisfied with its case and would have liked to find more definite proof of Lanrivains complicity than the statement of the herb gatherer who swore to having seen him climbing the wall of the park on the night of the murder
One way of patching out incomplete proofs in those days was to put some sort of pressure moral or physical on the accused person
It is not clear what pressure was put on Anne de Cornault but on the third day when she was brought into court she appeared weak and wandering and after being encouraged to collect herself and speak the truth on her honour and the wounds of her Blessed Redeemer she confessed that she had in fact gone down the stairs to speak with Herve de Lanrivain who denied everything and had been surprised there by the sound of her husbands fall
That was better and the prosecution rubbed its hands with satisfaction
The satisfaction increased when various dependents living at Kerfol were induced to saywith apparent sinceritythat during the year or two preceding his death their master had once more grown uncertain and irascible and subject to the fits of brooding silence which his household had learned to dread before his second marriage
This seemed to show that things had not been going well at Kerfol though no one could be found to say that there had been any signs of open disagreement between husband and wife
Anne de Cornault when questioned as to her reason for going down at night to open the door to Herve de Lanrivain made an answer which must have sent a smile around the court
She said it was because she was lonely and wanted to talk with the young man
Was this the only reason
she was asked and replied Yes by the Cross over your Lordships heads
But why at midnight
the court asked
Because I could see him in no other way
I can see the exchange of glances across the ermine collars under the Crucifix
Anne de Cornault further questioned said that her married life had been extremely lonely desolate was the word she used
It was true that her husband seldom spoke harshly to her but there were days when he did not speak at all
It was true that he had never struck or threatened her but he kept her like a prisoner at Kerfol and when he rode away to Morlaix or Quimper or Rennes he set so close a watch on her that she could not pick a flower in the garden without having a waitingwoman at her heels
I am no Queen to need such honours she once said to him and he had answered that a man who has a treasure does not leave the key in the lock when he goes out
Then take me with you she urged but to this he said that towns were pernicious places and young wives better off at their own firesides
But what did you want to say to Herve de Lanrivain
the court asked and she answered To ask him to take me away
Ahyou confess that you went down to him with adulterous thoughts
No
Then why did you want him to take you away
Because I was afraid for my life
Of whom were you afraid
Of my husband
Why were you afraid of your husband
Because he had strangled my little dog
Another smile must have passed around the courtroom in days when any nobleman had a right to hang his peasantsand most of them exercised itpinching a pet animals windpipe was nothing to make a fuss about
At this point one of the Judges who appears to have had a certain sympathy for the accused suggested that she should be allowed to explain herself in her own way and she thereupon made the following statement
The first years of her marriage had been lonely but her husband had not been unkind to her
If she had had a child she would not have been unhappy but the days were long and it rained too much
It was true that her husband whenever he went away and left her brought her a handsome present on his return but this did not make up for the loneliness
At least nothing had till he brought her the little brown dog from the East after that she was much less unhappy
Her husband seemed pleased that she was so fond of the dog he gave her leave to put her jewelled bracelet around its neck and to keep it always with her
One day she had fallen asleep in her room with the dog at her feet as his habit was
Her feet were bare and resting on his back
Suddenly she was waked by her husband he stood beside her smiling not unkindly
You look like my greatgrandmother Juliane de Cornault lying in the chapel with her feet on a little dog he said
The analogy sent a chill through her but she laughed and answered Well when I am dead you must put me beside her carved in marble with my dog at my feet
Ohowell wait and see he said laughing also but with his black brows close together
The dog is the emblem of fidelity
And do you doubt my right to lie with mine at my feet
When Im in doubt I find out he answered
I am an old man he added and people say I make you lead a lonely life
But I swear you shall have your monument if you earn it
And I swear to be faithful she returned if only for the sake of having my little dog at my feet
Not long afterward he went on business to the Quimper Assizes and while he was away his aunt the widow of a great nobleman of the duchy came to spend a night at Kerfol on her way to the pardon of Ste
Barbe
She was a woman of great piety and consequence and much respected by Yves de Cornault and when she proposed to Anne to go with her to Ste
Barbe no one could object and even the chaplain declared himself in favour of the pilgrimage
So Anne set out for Ste
Barbe and there for the first time she talked with Herve de Lanrivain
He had come once or twice to Kerfol with his father but she had never before exchanged a dozen words with him
They did not talk for more than five minutes now it was under the chestnuts as the procession was coming out of the chapel
He said I pity you and she was surprised for she had not supposed that any one thought her an object of pity
He added Call for me when you need me and she smiled a little but was glad afterward and thought often of the meeting
She confessed to having seen him three times afterward not more
How or where she would not sayone had the impression that she feared to implicate some one
Their meetings had been rare and brief and at the last he had told her that he was starting the next day for a foreign country on a mission which was not without peril and might keep him for many months absent
He asked her for a remembrance and she had none to give him but the collar about the little dogs neck
She was sorry afterward that she had given it but he was so unhappy at going that she had not had the courage to refuse
Her husband was away at the time
When he returned a few days later he picked up the little dog to pet it and noticed that its collar was missing
His wife told him that the dog had lost it in the undergrowth of the park and that she and her maids had hunted a whole day for it
It was true she explained to the court that she had made the maids search for the neckletthey all believed the dog had lost it in the park


Her husband made no comment and that evening at supper he was in his usual mood between good and bad you could never tell which
He talked a good deal describing what he had seen and done at Rennes but now and then he stopped and looked hard at her and when she went to bed she found her little dog strangled on her pillow
The little thing was dead but still warm she stooped to lift it and her distress turned to horror when she discovered that it had been strangled by twisting twice round its throat the necklet she had given to Lanrivain
The next morning at dawn she buried the dog in the garden and hid the necklet in her breast
She said nothing to her husband then or later and he said nothing to her but that day he had a peasant hanged for stealing a faggot in the park and the next day he nearly beat to death a young horse he was breaking
Winter set in and the short days passed and the long nights one by one and she heard nothing of Herve de Lanrivain
It might be that her husband had killed him or merely that he had been robbed of the necklet
Day after day by the hearth among the spinning maids night after night alone on her bed she wondered and trembled
Sometimes at table her husband looked across at her and smiled and then she felt sure that Lanrivain was dead
She dared not try to get news of him for she was sure her husband would find out if she did she had an idea that he could find out anything
Even when a witchwoman who was a noted seer and could show you the whole world in her crystal came to the castle for a nights shelter and the maids flocked to her Anne held back
The winter was long and black and rainy
One day in Yves de Cornaults absence some gypsies came to Kerfol with a troop of performing dogs
Anne bought the smallest and cleverest a white dog with a feathery coat and one blue and one brown eye
It seemed to have been illtreated by the gypsies and clung to her plaintively when she took it from them
That evening her husband came back and when she went to bed she found the dog strangled on her pillow
After that she said to herself that she would never have another dog but one bitter cold evening a poor lean greyhound was found whining at the castlegate and she took him in and forbade the maids to speak of him to her husband
She hid him in a room that no one went to smuggled food to him from her own plate made him a warm bed to lie on and petted him like a child
Yves de Cornault came home and the next day she found the greyhound strangled on her pillow
She wept in secret but said nothing and resolved that even if she met a dog dying of hunger she would never bring him into the castle but one day she found a young sheepdog a brindled puppy with good blue eyes lying with a broken leg in the snow of the park
Yves de Cornault was at Rennes and she brought the dog in warmed and fed it tied up its leg and hid it in the castle till her husbands return
The day before she gave it to a peasant woman who lived a long way off and paid her handsomely to care for it and say nothing but that night she heard a whining and scratching at her door and when she opened it the lame puppy drenched and shivering jumped up on her with little sobbing barks
She hid him in her bed and the next morning was about to have him taken back to the peasant woman when she heard her husband ride into the court
She shut the dog in a chest and went down to receive him
An hour or two later when she returned to her room the puppy lay strangled on her pillow


After that she dared not make a pet of any other dog and her loneliness became almost unendurable
Sometimes when she crossed the court of the castle and thought no one was looking she stopped to pat the old pointer at the gate
But one day as she was caressing him her husband came out of the chapel and the next day the old dog was gone


This curious narrative was not told in one sitting of the court or received without impatience and incredulous comment
It was plain that the Judges were surprised by its puerility and that it did not help the accused in the eyes of the public
It was an odd tale certainly but what did it prove
That Yves de Cornault disliked dogs and that his wife to gratify her own fancy persistently ignored this dislike
As for pleading this trivial disagreement as an excuse for her relationswhatever their naturewith her supposed accomplice the argument was so absurd that her own lawyer manifestly regretted having let her make use of it and tried several times to cut short her story
But she went on to the end with a kind of hypnotized insistence as though the scenes she evoked were so real to her that she had forgotten where she was and imagined herself to be reliving them
At length the Judge who had previously shown a certain kindness to her said leaning forward a little one may suppose from his row of dozing colleagues Then you would have us believe that you murdered your husband because he would not let you keep a pet dog
I did not murder my husband
Who did then
Herve de Lanrivain
No
Who then
Can you tell us
Yes I can tell you
The dogs At that point she was carried out of the court in a swoon








It was evident that her lawyer tried to get her to abandon this line of defense
Possibly her explanation whatever it was had seemed convincing when she poured it out to him in the heat of their first private colloquy but now that it was exposed to the cold daylight of judicial scrutiny and the banter of the town he was thoroughly ashamed of it and would have sacrificed her without a scruple to save his professional reputation
But the obstinate Judgewho perhaps after all was more inquisitive than kindlyevidently wanted to hear the story out and she was ordered the next day to continue her deposition
She said that after the disappearance of the old watchdog nothing particular happened for a month or two
Her husband was much as usual she did not remember any special incident
But one evening a pedlar woman came to the castle and was selling trinkets to the maids
She had no heart for trinkets but she stood looking on while the women made their choice
And then she did not know how but the pedlar coaxed her into buying for herself an odd pearshaped pomander with a strong scent in it she had once seen something of the kind on a gypsy woman
She had no desire for the pomander and did not know why she had bought it
The pedlar said that whoever wore it had the power to read the future but she did not really believe that or care much either
However she bought the thing and took it up to her room where she sat turning it about in her hand
Then the strange scent attracted her and she began to wonder what kind of spice was in the box
She opened it and found a grey bean rolled in a strip of paper and on the paper she saw a sign she knew and a message from Herve de Lanrivain saying that he was at home again and would be at the door in the court that night after the moon had set


She burned the paper and then sat down to think
It was nightfall and her husband was at home


She had no way of warning Lanrivain and there was nothing to do but to wait


At this point I fancy the drowsy courtroom beginning to wake up
Even to the oldest hand on the bench there must have been a certain aesthetic relish in picturing the feelings of a woman on receiving such a message at nightfall from a man living twenty miles away to whom she had no means of sending a warning


She was not a clever woman I imagine and as the first result of her cogitation she appears to have made the mistake of being that evening too kind to her husband
She could not ply him with wine according to the traditional expedient for though he drank heavily at times he had a strong head and when he drank beyond its strength it was because he chose to and not because a woman coaxed him
Not his wife at any rateshe was an old story by now
As I read the case I fancy there was no feeling for her left in him but the hatred occasioned by his supposed dishonour
At any rate she tried to call up her old graces but early in the evening he complained of pains and fever and left the hall to go up to his room
His servant carried him a cup of hot wine and brought back word that he was sleeping and not to be disturbed and an hour later when Anne lifted the tapestry and listened at his door she heard his loud regular breathing
She thought it might be a feint and stayed a long time barefooted in the cold passage her ear to the crack but the breathing went on too steadily and naturally to be other than that of a man in a sound sleep
She crept back to her room reassured and stood in the window watching the moon set through the trees of the park
The sky was misty and starless and after the moon went down the night was pitch black
She knew the time had come and stole along the passage past her husbands doorwhere she stopped again to listen to his breathingto the top of the stairs
There she paused a moment and assured herself that no one was following her then she began to go down the stairs in the darkness
They were so steep and winding that she had to go very slowly for fear of stumbling
Her one thought was to get the door unbolted tell Lanrivain to make his escape and hasten back to her room
She had tried the bolt earlier in the evening and managed to put a little grease on it but nevertheless when she drew it it gave a squeak 


not loud but it made her heart stop and the next minute overhead she heard a noise


What noise
the prosecution interposed
My husbands voice calling out my name and cursing me
What did you hear after that
A terrible scream and a fall
Where was Herve de Lanrivain at this time
He was standing outside in the court
I just made him out in the darkness
I told him for Gods sake to go and then I pushed the door shut
What did you do next
I stood at the foot of the stairs and listened
What did you hear
I heard dogs snarling and panting
Visible discouragement of the bench boredom of the public and exasperation of the lawyer for the defense
Dogs again
But the inquisitive Judge insisted
What dogs
She bent her head and spoke so low that she had to be told to repeat her answer I dont know
How do you meanyou dont know
I dont know what dogs


The Judge again intervened Try to tell us exactly what happened
How long did you remain at the foot of the stairs
Only a few minutes
And what was going on meanwhile overhead
The dogs kept on snarling and panting
Once or twice he cried out
I think he moaned once
Then he was quiet
Then what happened
Then I heard a sound like the noise of a pack when the wolf is thrown to themgulping and lapping
There was a groan of disgust and repulsion through the court and another attempted intervention by the distracted lawyer
But the inquisitive Judge was still inquisitive
And all the while you did not go up
YesI went up thento drive them off
The dogs
Yes
Well
When I got there it was quite dark
I found my husbands flint and steel and struck a spark
I saw him lying there
He was dead
And the dogs
The dogs were gone
Gonewhere to
I dont know
There was no way outand there were no dogs at Kerfol
She straightened herself to her full height threw her arms above her head and fell down on the stone floor with a long scream
There was a moment of confusion in the courtroom
Some one on the bench was heard to say This is clearly a case for the ecclesiastical authoritiesand the prisoners lawyer doubtless jumped at the suggestion
After this the trial loses itself in a maze of crossquestioning and squabbling
Every witness who was called corroborated Anne de Cornaults statement that there were no dogs at Kerfol had been none for several months
The master of the house had taken a dislike to dogs there was no denying it
But on the other hand at the inquest there had been long and bitter discussion as to the nature of the dead mans wounds
One of the surgeons called in had spoken of marks that looked like bites
The suggestion of witchcraft was revived and the opposing lawyers hurled tomes of necromancy at each other
At last Anne de Cornault was brought back into courtat the instance of the same Judgeand asked if she knew where the dogs she spoke of could have come from
On the body of her Redeemer she swore that she did not
Then the Judge put his final question If the dogs you think you heard had been known to you do you think you would have recognized them by their barking
Yes
Did you recognize them
Yes
What dogs do you take them to have been
My dead dogs she said in a whisper


She was taken out of court not to reappear there again
There was some kind of ecclesiastical investigation and the end of the business was that the Judges disagreed with each other and with the ecclesiastical committee and that Anne de Cornault was finally handed over to the keeping of her husbands family who shut her up in the keep of Kerfol where she is said to have died many years later a harmless madwoman
So ends her story
As for that of Herve de Lanrivain I had only to apply to his collateral descendant for its subsequent details
The evidence against the young man being insufficient and his family influence in the duchy considerable he was set free and left soon afterward for Paris
He was probably in no mood for a worldly life and he appears to have come almost immediately under the influence of the famous M Arnauld dAndilly and the gentlemen of Port Royal
A year or two later he was received into their Order and without achieving any particular distinction he followed its good and evil fortunes till his death some twenty years later
Lanrivain showed me a portrait of him by a pupil of Philippe de Champaigne sad eyes an impulsive mouth and a narrow brow
Poor Herve de Lanrivain it was a grey ending
Yet as I looked at his stiff and sallow effigy in the dark dress of the Jansenists I almost found myself envying his fate
After all in the course of his life two great things had happened to him he had loved romantically and he must have talked with Pascal


The End MRS MANSTEYS VIEW as first published in Scribners Magazine July 1891 The view from Mrs Mansteys window was not a striking one but to her at least it was full of interest and beauty
Mrs Manstey occupied the back room on the third floor of a New York boarding house in a street where the ashbarrels lingered late on the sidewalk and the gaps in the pavement would have staggered a Quintus Curtius
She was the widow of a clerk in a large wholesale house and his death had left her alone for her only daughter had married in California and could not afford the long journey to New York to see her mother
Mrs Manstey perhaps might have joined her daughter in the West but they had now been so many years apart that they had ceased to feel any need of each others society and their intercourse had long been limited to the exchange of a few perfunctory letters written with indifference by the daughter and with difficulty by Mrs Manstey whose right hand was growing stiff with gout
Even had she felt a stronger desire for her daughters companionship Mrs Mansteys increasing infirmity which caused her to dread the three flights of stairs between her room and the street would have given her pause on the eve of undertaking so long a journey and without perhaps formulating these reasons she had long since accepted as a matter of course her solitary life in New York
She was indeed not quite lonely for a few friends still toiled up now and then to her room but their visits grew rare as the years went by
Mrs Manstey had never been a sociable woman and during her husbands lifetime his companionship had been all sufficient to her
For many years she had cherished a desire to live in the country to have a henhouse and a garden but this longing had faded with age leaving only in the breast of the uncommunicative old woman a vague tenderness for plants and animals
It was perhaps this tenderness which made her cling so fervently to her view from her window a view in which the most optimistic eye would at first have failed to discover anything admirable
Mrs Manstey from her coign of vantage a slightly projecting bowwindow where she nursed an ivy and a succession of unwholesomelooking bulbs looked out first upon the yard of her own dwelling of which however she could get but a restricted glimpse
Still her gaze took in the topmost boughs of the ailanthus below her window and she knew how early each year the clump of dicentra strung its bending stalk with hearts of pink
But of greater interest were the yards beyond
Being for the most part attached to boardinghouses they were in a state of chronic untidiness and fluttering on certain days of the week with miscellaneous garments and frayed tablecloths
In spite of this Mrs Manstey found much to admire in the long vista which she commanded
Some of the yards were indeed but stony wastes with grass in the cracks of the pavement and no shade in spring save that afforded by the intermittent leafage of the clothes lines
These yards Mrs Manstey disapproved of but the others the green ones she loved
She had grown used to their disorder the broken barrels the empty bottles and paths unswept no longer annoyed her hers was the happy faculty of dwelling on the pleasanter side of the prospect before her
In the very next enclosure did not a magnolia open its hard white flowers against the watery blue of April
And was there not a little way down the line a fence foamed over every May be lilac waves of wistaria
Farther still a horsechestnut lifted its candelabra of buff and pink blossoms above broad fans of foliage while in the opposite yard June was sweet with the breath of a neglected syringa which persisted in growing in spite of the countless obstacles opposed to its welfare
But if nature occupied the front rank in Mrs Mansteys view there was much of a more personal character to interest her in the aspect of the houses and their inmates
She deeply disapproved of the mustardcolored curtains which had lately been hung in the doctors window opposite but she glowed with pleasure when the house farther down had its old bricks washed with a coat of paint
The occupants of the houses did not often show themselves at the back windows but the servants were always in sight
Noisy slatterns Mrs Manstey pronounced the greater number she knew their ways and hated them
But to the quiet cook in the newly painted house whose mistress bullied her and who secretly fed the stray cats at nightfall Mrs Mansteys warmest sympathies were given
On one occasion her feelings were racked by the neglect of a housemaid who for two days forgot to feed the parrot committed to her care
On the third day Mrs Manstey in spite of her gouty hand had just penned a letter beginning Madam it is now three days since your parrot has been fed when the forgetful maid appeared at the window with a cup of seed in her hand
But in Mrs Mansteys more meditative moods it was the narrowing perspective of faroff yards which pleased her best
She loved at twilight when the distant brownstone spire seemed melting in the fluid yellow of the west to lose herself in vague memories of a trip to Europe made years ago and now reduced in her minds eye to a pale phantasmagoria of indistinct steeples and dreamy skies
Perhaps at heart Mrs Manstey was an artist at all events she was sensible of many changes of color unnoticed by the average eye and dear to her as the green of early spring was the black lattice of branches against a cold sulphur sky at the close of a snowy day
She enjoyed also the sunny thaws of March when patches of earth showed through the snow like ink spots spreading on a sheet of white blottingpaper and better still the haze of boughs leafless but swollen which replaced the clearcut tracery of winter
She even watched with a certain interest the trail of smoke from a faroff factory chimney and missed a detail in the landscape when the factory was closed and the smoke disappeared
Mrs Manstey in the long hours which she spent at her window was not idle
She read a little and knitted numberless stockings but the view surrounded and shaped her life as the sea does a lonely island
When her rare callers came it was difficult for her to detach herself from the contemplation of the opposite windowwashing or the scrutiny of certain green points in a neighboring flowerbed which might or might not turn into hyacinths while she feigned an interest in her visitors anecdotes about some unknown grandchild
Mrs Mansteys real friends were the denizens of the yards the hyacinths the magnolia the green parrot the maid who fed the cats the doctor who studied late behind his mustardcolored curtains and the confidant of her tenderer musings was the churchspire floating in the sunset
One April day as she sat in her usual place with knitting cast aside and eyes fixed on the blue sky mottled with round clouds a knock at the door announced the entrance of her landlady
Mrs Manstey did not care for her landlady but she submitted to her visits with ladylike resignation
Today however it seemed harder than usual to turn from the blue sky and the blossoming magnolia to Mrs Sampsons unsuggestive face and Mrs Manstey was conscious of a distinct effort as she did so
The magnolia is out earlier than usual this year Mrs Sampson she remarked yielding to a rare impulse for she seldom alluded to the absorbing interest of her life
In the first place it was a topic not likely to appeal to her visitors and besides she lacked the power of expression and could not have given utterance to her feelings had she wished to
The what Mrs
Manstey
inquired the landlady glancing about the room as if to find there the explanation of Mrs Mansteys statement
The magnolia in the next yardin Mrs Blacks yard Mrs Manstey repeated
Is it indeed
I didnt know there was a magnolia there said Mrs Sampson carelessly
Mrs Manstey looked at her she did not know that there was a magnolia in the next yard
By the way Mrs Sampson continued speaking of Mrs Black reminds me that the work on the extension is to begin next week
The what
it was Mrs Mansteys turn to ask
The extension said Mrs Sampson nodding her head in the direction of the ignored magnolia
You knew of course that Mrs Black was going to build an extension to her house
Yes maam
I hear it is to run right back to the end of the yard
How she can afford to build an extension in these hard times I dont see but she always was crazy about building
She used to keep a boardinghouse in Seventeenth Street and she nearly ruined herself then by sticking out bowwindows and what not I should have thought that would have cured her of building but I guess its a disease like drink
Anyhow the work is to begin on Monday
Mrs Manstey had grown pale
She always spoke slowly so the landlady did not heed the long pause which followed
At last Mrs Manstey said Do you know how high the extension will be
Thats the most absurd part of it
The extension is to be built right up to the roof of the main building now did you ever
Mrs Manstey paused again
Wont it be a great annoyance to you Mrs
Sampson
she asked
I should say it would
But theres no help for it if people have got a mind to build extensions theres no law to prevent em that Im aware of
Mrs Manstey knowing this was silent
There is no help for it Mrs Sampson repeated but if I AM a church member I wouldnt be so sorry if it ruined Eliza Black
Well goodday Mrs Manstey Im glad to find you so comfortable
So comfortableso comfortable
Left to herself the old woman turned once more to the window
How lovely the view was that day
The blue sky with its round clouds shed a brightness over everything the ailanthus had put on a tinge of yellowgreen the hyacinths were budding the magnolia flowers looked more than ever like rosettes carved in alabaster
Soon the wistaria would bloom then the horsechestnut but not for her
Between her eyes and them a barrier of brick and mortar would swiftly rise presently even the spire would disappear and all her radiant world be blotted out
Mrs Manstey sent away untouched the dinnertray brought to her that evening
She lingered in the window until the windy sunset died in batcolored dusk then going to bed she lay sleepless all night
Early the next day she was up and at the window
It was raining but even through the slanting gray gauze the scene had its charm and then the rain was so good for the trees
She had noticed the day before that the ailanthus was growing dusty
Of course I might move said Mrs Manstey aloud and turning from the window she looked about her room
She might move of course so might she be flayed alive but she was not likely to survive either operation
The room though far less important to her happiness than the view was as much a part of her existence
She had lived in it seventeen years
She knew every stain on the wallpaper every rent in the carpet the light fell in a certain way on her engravings her books had grown shabby on their shelves her bulbs and ivy were used to their window and knew which way to lean to the sun
We are all too old to move she said
That afternoon it cleared
Wet and radiant the blue reappeared through torn rags of cloud the ailanthus sparkled the earth in the flowerborders looked rich and warm
It was Thursday and on Monday the building of the extension was to begin
On Sunday afternoon a card was brought to Mrs Black as she was engaged in gathering up the fragments of the boarders dinner in the basement
The card blackedged bore Mrs Mansteys name
One of Mrs Sampsons boarders wants to move I suppose
Well I can give her a room next year in the extension
Dinah said Mrs Black tell the lady Ill be upstairs in a minute
Mrs Black found Mrs Manstey standing in the long parlor garnished with statuettes and antimacassars in that house she could not sit down
Stooping hurriedly to open the register which let out a cloud of dust Mrs Black advanced on her visitor
Im happy to meet you Mrs Manstey take a seat please the landlady remarked in her prosperous voice the voice of a woman who can afford to build extensions
There was no help for it Mrs Manstey sat down
Is there anything I can do for you maam
Mrs Black continued
My house is full at present but I am going to build an extension and It is about the extension that I wish to speak said Mrs Manstey suddenly
I am a poor woman Mrs Black and I have never been a happy one
I shall have to talk about myself first toto make you understand
Mrs Black astonished but imperturbable bowed at this parenthesis
I never had what I wanted Mrs Manstey continued
It was always one disappointment after another
For years I wanted to live in the country
I dreamed and dreamed about it but we never could manage it
There was no sunny window in our house and so all my plants died
My daughter married years ago and went awaybesides she never cared for the same things
Then my husband died and I was left alone
That was seventeen years ago
I went to live at Mrs Sampsons and I have been there ever since
I have grown a little infirm as you see and I dont get out often only on fine days if I am feeling very well
So you can understand my sitting a great deal in my windowthe back window on the third floor Well Mrs Manstey said Mrs Black liberally I could give you a back room I dare say one of the new rooms in the ex But I dont want to move I cant move said Mrs Manstey almost with a scream
And I came to tell you that if you build that extension I shall have no view from my windowno view
Do you understand
Mrs Black thought herself face to face with a lunatic and she had always heard that lunatics must be humored
Dear me dear me she remarked pushing her chair back a little way that is too bad isnt it
Why I never thought of that
To be sure the extension WILL interfere with your view Mrs
Manstey
You do understand
Mrs Manstey gasped
Of course I do
And Im real sorry about it too
But there dont you worry Mrs Manstey
I guess we can fix that all right
Mrs Manstey rose from her seat and Mrs Black slipped toward the door
What do you mean by fixing it
Do you mean that I can induce you to change your mind about the extension
Oh Mrs Black listen to me
I have two thousand dollars in the bank and I could manage I know I could manage to give you a thousand if Mrs Manstey paused the tears were rolling down her cheeks
There there Mrs Manstey dont you worry repeated Mrs Black soothingly
I am sure we can settle it
I am sorry that I cant stay and talk about it any longer but this is such a busy time of day with supper to get Her hand was on the doorknob but with sudden vigor Mrs Manstey seized her wrist
You are not giving me a definite answer
Do you mean to say that you accept my proposition
Why Ill think it over Mrs Manstey certainly I will
I wouldnt annoy you for the world But the work is to begin tomorrow I am told Mrs Manstey persisted
Mrs Black hesitated
It shant begin I promise you that Ill send word to the builder this very night
Mrs Manstey tightened her hold
You are not deceiving me are you
she said
Nono stammered Mrs Black
How can you think such a thing of me Mrs
Manstey
Slowly Mrs Mansteys clutch relaxed and she passed through the open door
One thousand dollars she repeated pausing in the hall then she let herself out of the house and hobbled down the steps supporting herself on the castiron railing
My goodness exclaimed Mrs Black shutting and bolting the halldoor I never knew the old woman was crazy
And she looks so quiet and ladylike too
Mrs Manstey slept well that night but early the next morning she was awakened by a sound of hammering
She got to her window with what haste she might and looking out saw that Mrs Blacks yard was full of workmen
Some were carrying loads of brick from the kitchen to the yard others beginning to demolish the old fashioned wooden balcony which adorned each story of Mrs Blacks house
Mrs Manstey saw that she had been deceived
At first she thought of confiding her trouble to Mrs Sampson but a settled discouragement soon took possession of her and she went back to bed not caring to see what was going on
Toward afternoon however feeling that she must know the worst she rose and dressed herself
It was a laborious task for her hands were stiffer than usual and the hooks and buttons seemed to evade her
When she seated herself in the window she saw that the workmen had removed the upper part of the balcony and that the bricks had multiplied since morning
One of the men a coarse fellow with a bloated face picked a magnolia blossom and after smelling it threw it to the ground the next man carrying a load of bricks trod on the flower in passing
Look out Jim called one of the men to another who was smoking a pipe if you throw matches around near those barrels of paper youll have the old tinderbox burning down before you know it
And Mrs Manstey leaning forward perceived that there were several barrels of paper and rubbish under the wooden balcony
At length the work ceased and twilight fell
The sunset was perfect and a roseate light transfiguring the distant spire lingered late in the west
When it grew dark Mrs Manstey drew down the shades and proceeded in her usual methodical manner to light her lamp
She always filled and lit it with her own hands keeping a kettle of kerosene on a zinccovered shelf in a closet
As the lamplight filled the room it assumed its usual peaceful aspect
The books and pictures and plants seemed like their mistress to settle themselves down for another quiet evening and Mrs Manstey as was her wont drew up her armchair to the table and began to knit
That night she could not sleep
The weather had changed and a wild wind was abroad blotting the stars with closedriven clouds
Mrs Manstey rose once or twice and looked out of the window but of the view nothing was discernible save a tardy light or two in the opposite windows
These lights at last went out and Mrs Manstey who had watched for their extinction began to dress herself
She was in evident haste for she merely flung a thin dressinggown over her nightdress and wrapped her head in a scarf then she opened her closet and cautiously took out the kettle of kerosene
Having slipped a bundle of wooden matches into her pocket she proceeded with increasing precautions to unlock her door and a few moments later she was feeling her way down the dark staircase led by a glimmer of gas from the lower hall
At length she reached the bottom of the stairs and began the more difficult descent into the utter darkness of the basement
Here however she could move more freely as there was less danger of being overheard and without much delay she contrived to unlock the iron door leading into the yard
A gust of cold wind smote her as she stepped out and groped shiveringly under the clotheslines
That morning at three oclock an alarm of fire brought the engines to Mrs Blacks door and also brought Mrs Sampsons startled boarders to their windows
The wooden balcony at the back of Mrs Blacks house was ablaze and among those who watched the progress of the flames was Mrs Manstey leaning in her thin dressinggown from the open window
The fire however was soon put out and the frightened occupants of the house who had fled in scant attire reassembled at dawn to find that little mischief had been done beyond the cracking of window panes and smoking of ceilings
In fact the chief sufferer by the fire was Mrs Manstey who was found in the morning gasping with pneumonia a not unnatural result as everyone remarked of her having hung out of an open window at her age in a dressinggown
It was easy to see that she was very ill but no one had guessed how grave the doctors verdict would be and the faces gathered that evening about Mrs Sampsons table were awestruck and disturbed
Not that any of the boarders knew Mrs Manstey well she kept to herself as they said and seemed to fancy herself too good for them but then it is always disagreeable to have anyone dying in the house and as one lady observed to another It might just as well have been you or me my dear
But it was only Mrs Manstey and she was dying as she had lived lonely if not alone
The doctor had sent a trained nurse and Mrs Sampson with muffled step came in from time to time but both to Mrs Manstey seemed remote and unsubstantial as the figures in a dream
All day she said nothing but when she was asked for her daughters address she shook her head
At times the nurse noticed that she seemed to be listening attentively for some sound which did not come then again she dozed
The next morning at daylight she was very low
The nurse called Mrs Sampson and as the two bent over the old woman they saw her lips move
Lift me upout of bed she whispered
They raised her in their arms and with her stiff hand she pointed to the window
Oh the windowshe wants to sit in the window
She used to sit there all day Mrs Sampson explained
It can do her no harm I suppose
Nothing matters now said the nurse
They carried Mrs Manstey to the window and placed her in her chair
The dawn was abroad a jubilant spring dawn the spire had already caught a golden ray though the magnolia and horse chestnut still slumbered in shadow
In Mrs Blacks yard all was quiet
The charred timbers of the balcony lay where they had fallen
It was evident that since the fire the builders had not returned to their work
The magnolia had unfolded a few more sculptural flowers the view was undisturbed
It was hard for Mrs Manstey to breathe each moment it grew more difficult
She tried to make them open the window but they would not understand
If she could have tasted the air sweet with the penetrating ailanthus savor it would have eased her but the view at least was therethe spire was golden now the heavens had warmed from pearl to blue day was alight from east to west even the magnolia had caught the sun
Mrs Mansteys head fell back and smiling she died
That day the building of the extension was resumed
The End THE BOLTED DOOR as first published in Scribners Magazine March 1909 I Hubert Granice pacing the length of his pleasant lamplit library paused to compare his watch with the clock on the chimneypiece
Three minutes to eight
In exactly three minutes Mr Peter Ascham of the eminent legal firm of Ascham and Pettilow would have his punctual hand on the doorbell of the flat
It was a comfort to reflect that Ascham was so punctualthe suspense was beginning to make his host nervous
And the sound of the doorbell would be the beginning of the endafter that thered be no going back by Godno going back
Granice resumed his pacing
Each time he reached the end of the room opposite the door he caught his reflection in the Florentine mirror above the fine old walnut credence he had picked up at Dijonsaw himself spare quickmoving carefully brushed and dressed but furrowed gray about the temples with a stoop which he corrected by a spasmodic straightening of the shoulders whenever a glass confronted him a tired middleaged man baffled beaten worn out
As he summed himself up thus for the third or fourth time the door opened and he turned with a thrill of relief to greet his guest
But it was only the manservant who entered advancing silently over the mossy surface of the old Turkey rug
Mr Ascham telephones sir to say hes unexpectedly detained and cant be here till eightthirty
Granice made a curt gesture of annoyance
It was becoming harder and harder for him to control these reflexes
He turned on his heel tossing to the servant over his shoulder Very good
Put off dinner
Down his spine he felt the mans injured stare
Mr Granice had always been so mildspoken to his peopleno doubt the odd change in his manner had already been noticed and discussed below stairs
And very likely they suspected the cause
He stood drumming on the writingtable till he heard the servant go out then he threw himself into a chair propping his elbows on the table and resting his chin on his locked hands
Another half hour alone with it
He wondered irritably what could have detained his guest
Some professional matter no doubtthe punctilious lawyer would have allowed nothing less to interfere with a dinner engagement more especially since Granice in his note had said I shall want a little business chat afterward
But what professional matter could have come up at that unprofessional hour
Perhaps some other soul in misery had called on the lawyer and after all Granices note had given no hint of his own need
No doubt Ascham thought he merely wanted to make another change in his will
Since he had come into his little property ten years earlier Granice had been perpetually tinkering with his will
Suddenly another thought pulled him up sending a flush to his sallow temples
He remembered a word he had tossed to the lawyer some six weeks earlier at the Century Club
Yesmy plays as good as taken
I shall be calling on you soon to go over the contract
Those theatrical chaps are so slipperyI wont trust anybody but you to tie the knot for me
That of course was what Ascham would think he was wanted for
Granice at the idea broke into an audible laugha queer stagelaugh like the cackle of a baffled villain in a melodrama
The absurdity the unnaturalness of the sound abashed him and he compressed his lips angrily
Would he take to soliloquy next
He lowered his arms and pulled open the upper drawer of the writingtable
In the righthand corner lay a thick manuscript bound in paper folders and tied with a string beneath which a letter had been slipped
Next to the manuscript was a small revolver
Granice stared a moment at these oddly associated objects then he took the letter from under the string and slowly began to open it
He had known he should do so from the moment his hand touched the drawer
Whenever his eye fell on that letter some relentless force compelled him to reread it
It was dated about four weeks back under the letterhead of The Diversity Theatre
MY DEAR MR GRANICE I have given the matter my best consideration for the last month and its no usethe play wont do
I have talked it over with Miss Melroseand you know there isnt a gamer artist on our stageand I regret to tell you she feels just as I do about it
It isnt the poetry that scares heror me either
We both want to do all we can to help along the poetic dramawe believe the publics ready for it and were willing to take a big financial risk in order to be the first to give them what they want
BUT WE DONT BELIEVE THEY COULD BE MADE TO WANT THIS
The fact is there isnt enough drama in your play to the allowance of poetry the thing drags all through
Youve got a big idea but its not out of swaddling clothes
If this was your first play Id say TRY AGAIN
But it has been just the same with all the others youve shown me
And you remember the result of The Lee Shore where you carried all the expenses of production yourself and we couldnt fill the theatre for a week
Yet The Lee Shore was a modern problem playmuch easier to swing than blank verse
It isnt as if you hadnt tried all kinds Granice folded the letter and put it carefully back into the envelope
Why on earth was he rereading it when he knew every phrase in it by heart when for a month past he had seen it night after night stand out in letters of flame against the darkness of his sleepless lids
IT HAS BEEN JUST THE SAME WITH ALL THE OTHERS YOUVE SHOWN ME
That was the way they dismissed ten years of passionate unremitting work
YOU REMEMBER THE RESULT OF THE LEE SHORE
Good Godas if he were likely to forget it
He relived it all now in a drowning flash the persistent rejection of the play his sudden resolve to put it on at his own cost to spend ten thousand dollars of his inheritance on testing his chance of successthe fever of preparation the drymouthed agony of the first night the flat fall the stupid press his secret rush to Europe to escape the condolence of his friends
IT ISNT AS IF YOU HADNT TRIED ALL KINDS
Nohe had tried all kinds comedy tragedy prose and verse the light curtainraiser the short sharp drama the bourgeois realistic and the lyricalromanticfinally deciding that he would no longer prostitute his talent to win popularity but would impose on the public his own theory of art in the form of five acts of blank verse
Yes he had offered them everything and always with the same result
Ten years of itten years of dogged work and unrelieved failure
The ten years from forty to fiftythe best ten years of his life
And if one counted the years before the silent years of dreams assimilation preparationthen call it half a mans lifetime half a mans lifetime thrown away
And what was he to do with the remaining half
Well he had settled that thank God
He turned and glanced anxiously at the clock
Ten minutes past eightonly ten minutes had been consumed in that stormy rush through his whole past
And he must wait another twenty minutes for Ascham
It was one of the worst symptoms of his case that in proportion as he had grown to shrink from human company he dreaded more and more to be alone



But why the devil was he waiting for Ascham
Why didnt he cut the knot himself
Since he was so unutterably sick of the whole business why did he have to call in an outsider to rid him of this nightmare of living
He opened the drawer again and laid his hand on the revolver
It was a small slim ivory toyjust the instrument for a tired sufferer to give himself a hypodermic with
Granice raised it slowly in one hand while with the other he felt under the thin hair at the back of his head between the ear and the nape
He knew just where to place the muzzle he had once got a young surgeon to show him
And as he found the spot and lifted the revolver to it the inevitable phenomenon occurred
The hand that held the weapon began to shake the tremor communicated itself to his arm his heart gave a wild leap which sent up a wave of deadly nausea to his throat he smelt the powder he sickened at the crash of the bullet through his skull and a sweat of fear broke out over his forehead and ran down his quivering face


He laid away the revolver with an oath and pulling out a colognescented handkerchief passed it tremulously over his brow and temples
It was no usehe knew he could never do it in that way
His attempts at selfdestruction were as futile as his snatches at fame
He couldnt make himself a real life and he couldnt get rid of the life he had
And that was why he had sent for Ascham to help him


The lawyer over the Camembert and Burgundy began to excuse himself for his delay
I didnt like to say anything while your man was aboutbut the fact is I was sent for on a rather unusual matter Oh its all right said Granice cheerfully
He was beginning to feel the usual reaction that food and company produced
It was not any recovered pleasure in life that he felt but only a deeper withdrawal into himself
It was easier to go on automatically with the social gestures than to uncover to any human eye the abyss within him
My dear fellow its sacrilege to keep a dinner waiting especially the production of an artist like yours
Mr Ascham sipped his Burgundy luxuriously
But the fact is Mrs Ashgrove sent for me
Granice raised his head with a quick movement of surprise
For a moment he was shaken out of his selfabsorption
MRS
ASHGROVE
Ascham smiled
I thought youd be interested I know your passion for causes celebres
And this promises to be one
Of course its out of our line entirelywe never touch criminal cases
But she wanted to consult me as a friend
Ashgrove was a distant connection of my wifes
And by Jove it IS a queer case
The servant reentered and Ascham snapped his lips shut
Would the gentlemen have their coffee in the diningroom
Noserve it in the library said Granice rising
He led the way back to the curtained confidential room
He was really curious to hear what Ascham had to tell him
While the coffee and cigars were being served he fidgeted about the library glancing at his lettersthe usual meaningless notes and billsand picking up the evening paper
As he unfolded it a headline caught his eye
ROSE MELROSE WANTS TO PLAY POETRY
THINKS SHE HAS FOUND HER POET
He read on with a thumping heartfound the name of a young author he had barely heard of saw the title of a play a poetic drama dance before his eyes and dropped the paper sick disgusted
It was true thenshe WAS gameit was not the manner but the matter she mistrusted
Granice turned to the servant who seemed to be purposely lingering
I shant need you this evening Flint
Ill lock up myself
He fancied the mans acquiescence implied surprise
What was going on Flint seemed to wonder that Mr Granice should want him out of the way
Probably he would find a pretext for coming back to see
Granice suddenly felt himself enveloped in a network of espionage
As the door closed he threw himself into an armchair and leaned forward to take a light from Aschams cigar
Tell me about Mrs Ashgrove he said seeming to himself to speak stiffly as if his lips were cracked
Mrs Ashgrove
Well theres not much to TELL
And you couldnt if there were
Granice smiled
Probably not
As a matter of fact she wanted my advice about her choice of counsel
There was nothing especially confidential in our talk
And whats your impression now youve seen her
My impression is very distinctly THAT NOTHING WILL EVER BE KNOWN
Ah
Granice murmured puffing at his cigar
Im more and more convinced that whoever poisoned Ashgrove knew his business and will consequently never be found out
Thats a capital cigar youve given me
You like it
I get them over from Cuba
Granice examined his own reflectively
Then you believe in the theory that the clever criminals never ARE caught
Of course I do
Look about youlook back for the last dozen yearsnone of the big murder problems are ever solved
The lawyer ruminated behind his blue cloud
Why take the instance in your own family Id forgotten I had an illustration at hand
Take old Joseph Lenmans murderdo you suppose that will ever be explained
As the words dropped from Aschams lips his host looked slowly about the library and every object in it stared back at him with a stale unescapable familiarity
How sick he was of looking at that room
It was as dull as the face of a wife one has wearied of
He cleared his throat slowly then he turned his head to the lawyer and said I could explain the Lenman murder myself
Aschams eye kindled he shared Granices interest in criminal cases
By Jove
Youve had a theory all this time
Its odd you never mentioned it
Go ahead and tell me
There are certain features in the Lenman case not unlike this Ashgrove affair and your idea may be a help
Granice paused and his eye reverted instinctively to the table drawer in which the revolver and the manuscript lay side by side
What if he were to try another appeal to Rose Melrose
Then he looked at the notes and bills on the table and the horror of taking up again the lifeless routine of lifeof performing the same automatic gestures another daydisplaced his fleeting vision
I havent a theory
I KNOW who murdered Joseph Lenman
Ascham settled himself comfortably in his chair prepared for enjoyment
You KNOW
Well who did
he laughed
I did said Granice rising
He stood before Ascham and the lawyer lay back staring up at him
Then he broke into another laugh
Why this is glorious
You murdered him did you
To inherit his money I suppose
Better and better
Go on my boy
Unbosom yourself
Tell me all about it
Confession is good for the soul
Granice waited till the lawyer had shaken the last peal of laughter from his throat then he repeated doggedly I murdered him
The two men looked at each other for a long moment and this time Ascham did not laugh
Granice
I murdered himto get his money as you say
There was another pause and Granice with a vague underlying sense of amusement saw his guests look change from pleasantry to apprehension
Whats the joke my dear fellow
I fail to see
Its not a joke
Its the truth
I murdered him
He had spoken painfully at first as if there were a knot in his throat but each time he repeated the words he found they were easier to say
Ascham laid down his extinct cigar
Whats the matter
Arent you well
What on earth are you driving at
Im perfectly well
But I murdered my cousin Joseph Lenman and I want it known that I murdered him
YOU WANT IT KNOWN
Yes
Thats why I sent for you
Im sick of living and when I try to kill myself I funk it
He spoke quite naturally now as if the knot in his throat had been untied
Good Lordgood Lord the lawyer gasped
But I suppose Granice continued theres no doubt this would be murder in the first degree
Im sure of the chair if I own up
Ascham drew a long breath then he said slowly Sit down Granice
Lets talk
II Granice told his story simply connectedly
He began by a quick survey of his early yearsthe years of drudgery and privation
His father a charming man who could never say no had so signally failed to say it on certain essential occasions that when he died he left an illegitimate family and a mortgaged estate
His lawful kin found themselves hanging over a gulf of debt and young Granice to support his mother and sister had to leave Harvard and bury himself at eighteen in a brokers office
He loathed his work and he was always poor always worried and in illhealth
A few years later his mother died but his sister an ineffectual neurasthenic remained on his hands
His own health gave out and he had to go away for six months and work harder than ever when he came back
He had no knack for business no head for figures no dimmest insight into the mysteries of commerce
He wanted to travel and writethose were his inmost longings
And as the years dragged on and he neared middleage without making any more money or acquiring any firmer health a sick despair possessed him
He tried writing but he always came home from the office so tired that his brain could not work
For half the year he did not reach his dim uptown flat till after dark and could only brush up for dinner and afterward lie on the lounge with his pipe while his sister droned through the evening paper
Sometimes he spent an evening at the theatre or he dined out or more rarely strayed off with an acquaintance or two in quest of what is known as pleasure
And in summer when he and Kate went to the seaside for a month he dozed through the days in utter weariness
Once he fell in love with a charming girlbut what had he to offer her in Gods name
She seemed to like him and in common decency he had to drop out of the running
Apparently no one replaced him for she never married but grew stoutish grayish philanthropicyet how sweet she had been when he had first kissed her
One more wasted life he reflected


But the stage had always been his masterpassion
He would have sold his soul for the time and freedom to write plays
It was IN HIMhe could not remember when it had not been his deepest seated instinct
As the years passed it became a morbid a relentless obsessionyet with every year the material conditions were more and more against it
He felt himself growing middle aged and he watched the reflection of the process in his sisters wasted face
At eighteen she had been pretty and as full of enthusiasm as he
Now she was sour trivial insignificantshe had missed her chance of life
And she had no resources poor creature was fashioned simply for the primitive functions she had been denied the chance to fulfil
It exasperated him to think of itand to reflect that even now a little travel a little health a little money might transform her make her young and desirable


The chief fruit of his experience was that there is no such fixed state as age or youth there is only health as against sickness wealth as against poverty and age or youth as the outcome of the lot one draws
At this point in his narrative Granice stood up and went to lean against the mantelpiece looking down at Ascham who had not moved from his seat or changed his attitude of rigid fascinated attention
Then came the summer when we went to Wrenfield to be near old Lenmanmy mothers cousin as you know
Some of the family always mounted guard over himgenerally a niece or so
But that year they were all scattered and one of the nieces offered to lend us her cottage if wed relieve her of duty for two months
It was a nuisance for me of course for Wrenfield is two hours from town but my mother who was a slave to family observances had always been good to the old man so it was natural we should be called onand there was the saving of rent and the good air for Kate
So we went
You never knew Joseph Lenman
Well picture to yourself an amoeba or some primitive organism of that sort under a Titans microscope
He was large undifferentiated inertsince I could remember him he had done nothing but take his temperature and read the Churchman
Oh and cultivate melonsthat was his hobby
Not vulgar outofdoor melonshis were grown under glass
He had miles of it at Wrenfieldhis big kitchengarden was surrounded by blinking battalions of greenhouses
And in nearly all of them melons were grownearly melons and late French English domesticdwarf melons and monsters every shape colour and variety
They were petted and nursed like childrena staff of trained attendants waited on them
Im not sure they didnt have a doctor to take their temperatureat any rate the place was full of thermometers
And they didnt sprawl on the ground like ordinary melons they were trained against the glass like nectarines and each melon hung in a net which sustained its weight and left it free on all sides to the sun and air


It used to strike me sometimes that old Lenman was just like one of his own melonsthe palefleshed English kind
His life apathetic and motionless hung in a net of gold in an equable warm ventilated atmosphere high above sordid earthly worries
The cardinal rule of his existence was not to let himself be worried



I remember his advising me to try it myself one day when I spoke to him about Kates bad health and her need of a change
I never let myself worry he said complacently
Its the worst thing for the liverand you look to me as if you had a liver
Take my advice and be cheerful
Youll make yourself happier and others too
And all he had to do was to write a cheque and send the poor girl off for a holiday
The hardest part of it was that the money halfbelonged to us already
The old skinflint only had it for life in trust for us and the others
But his life was a good deal sounder than mine or Katesand one could picture him taking extra care of it for the joke of keeping us waiting
I always felt that the sight of our hungry eyes was a tonic to him
Well I tried to see if I couldnt reach him through his vanity
I flattered him feigned a passionate interest in his melons
And he was taken in and used to discourse on them by the hour
On fine days he was driven to the greenhouses in his ponychair and waddled through them prodding and leering at the fruit like a fat Turk in his seraglio
When he bragged to me of the expense of growing them I was reminded of a hideous old Lothario bragging of what his pleasures cost
And the resemblance was completed by the fact that he couldnt eat as much as a mouthful of his melonshad lived for years on buttermilk and toast
But after all its my only hobbywhy shouldnt I indulge it
he said sentimentally
As if Id ever been able to indulge any of mine
On the keep of those melons Kate and I could have lived like gods


One day toward the end of the summer when Kate was too unwell to drag herself up to the big house she asked me to go and spend the afternoon with cousin Joseph
It was a lovely soft September afternoona day to lie under a Roman stonepine with ones eyes on the sky and let the cosmic harmonies rush through one
Perhaps the vision was suggested by the fact that as I entered cousin Josephs hideous black walnut library I passed one of the undergardeners a handsome fullthroated Italian who dashed out in such a hurry that he nearly knocked me down
I remember thinking it queer that the fellow whom I had often seen about the melonhouses did not bow to me or even seem to see me
Cousin Joseph sat in his usual seat behind the darkened windows his fat hands folded on his protuberant waistcoat the last number of the Churchman at his elbow and near it on a huge dish a fat melonthe fattest melon Id ever seen
As I looked at it I pictured the ecstasy of contemplation from which I must have roused him and congratulated myself on finding him in such a mood since I had made up my mind to ask him a favour
Then I noticed that his face instead of looking as calm as an egg shell was distorted and whimperingand without stopping to greet me he pointed passionately to the melon
Look at it look at itdid you ever see such a beauty
Such firmnessroundnesssuch delicious smoothness to the touch
It was as if he had said she instead of it and when he put out his senile hand and touched the melon I positively had to look the other way
Then he told me what had happened
The Italian undergardener who had been specially recommended for the melonhousesthough it was against my cousins principles to employ a Papisthad been assigned to the care of the monster for it had revealed itself early in its existence as destined to become a monster to surpass its plumpest pulpiest sisters carry off prizes at agricultural shows and be photographed and celebrated in every gardening paper in the land
The Italian had done wellseemed to have a sense of responsibility
And that very morning he had been ordered to pick the melon which was to be shown next day at the county fair and to bring it in for Mr Lenman to gaze on its blonde virginity
But in picking it what had the damned scoundrelly Jesuit done but drop itdrop it crash on the sharp spout of a wateringpot so that it received a deep gash in its firm pale rotundity and was henceforth but a bruised ruined fallen melon
The old mans rage was fearful in its impotencehe shook spluttered and strangled with it
He had just had the Italian up and had sacked him on the spot without wages or characterhad threatened to have him arrested if he was ever caught prowling about Wrenfield
By God and Ill do itIll write to WashingtonIll have the pauper scoundrel deported
Ill show him what money can do
As likely as not there was some murderous Blackhand business under itit would be found that the fellow was a member of a gang
Those Italians would murder you for a quarter
He meant to have the police look into it


And then he grew frightened at his own excitement
But I must calm myself he said
He took his temperature rang for his drops and turned to the Churchman
He had been reading an article on Nestorianism when the melon was brought in
He asked me to go on with it and I read to him for an hour in the dim close room with a fat fly buzzing stealthily about the fallen melon
All the while one phrase of the old mans buzzed in my brain like the fly about the melon
ILL SHOW HIM WHAT MONEY CAN DO
Good heaven
If I could but show the old man
If I could make him see his power of giving happiness as a new outlet for his monstrous egotism
I tried to tell him something about my situation and Katesspoke of my illhealth my unsuccessful drudgery my longing to write to make myself a nameI stammered out an entreaty for a loan
I can guarantee to repay you sir Ive a halfwritten play as security


I shall never forget his glassy stare
His face had grown as smooth as an eggshell againhis eyes peered over his fat cheeks like sentinels over a slippery rampart
A halfwritten playa play of YOURS as security
He looked at me almost fearfully as if detecting the first symptoms of insanity
Do you understand anything of business
he enquired mildly
I laughed and answered No not much
He leaned back with closed lids
All this excitement has been too much for me he said
If youll excuse me Ill prepare for my nap
And I stumbled out of the room blindly like the Italian
Granice moved away from the mantelpiece and walked across to the tray set out with decanters and sodawater
He poured himself a tall glass of sodawater emptied it and glanced at Aschams dead cigar
Better light another he suggested
The lawyer shook his head and Granice went on with his tale
He told of his mounting obsessionhow the murderous impulse had waked in him on the instant of his cousins refusal and he had muttered to himself By God if you wont Ill make you
He spoke more tranquilly as the narrative proceeded as though his rage had died down once the resolve to act on it was taken
He applied his whole mind to the question of how the old man was to be disposed of
Suddenly he remembered the outcry Those Italians will murder you for a quarter
But no definite project presented itself he simply waited for an inspiration
Granice and his sister moved to town a day or two after the incident of the melon
But the cousins who had returned kept them informed of the old mans condition
One day about three weeks later Granice on getting home found Kate excited over a report from Wrenfield
The Italian had been there againhad somehow slipped into the house made his way up to the library and used threatening language
The housekeeper found cousin Joseph gasping the whites of his eyes showing something awful
The doctor was sent for and the attack warded off and the police had ordered the Italian from the neighbourhood
But cousin Joseph thereafter languished had nerves and lost his taste for toast and buttermilk
The doctor called in a colleague and the consultation amused and excited the old man he became once more an important figure
The medical men reassured the familytoo completelyand to the patient they recommended a more varied diet advised him to take whatever tempted him
And so one day tremulously prayerfully he decided on a tiny bit of melon
It was brought up with ceremony and consumed in the presence of the housekeeper and a hovering cousin and twenty minutes later he was dead


But you remember the circumstances Granice went on how suspicion turned at once on the Italian
In spite of the hint the police had given him he had been seen hanging about the house since the scene
It was said that he had tender relations with the kitchenmaid and the rest seemed easy to explain
But when they looked round to ask him for the explanation he was gone gone clean out of sight
He had been warned to leave Wrenfield and he had taken the warning so to heart that no one ever laid eyes on him again
Granice paused
He had dropped into a chair opposite the lawyers and he sat for a moment his head thrown back looking about the familiar room
Everything in it had grown grimacing and alien and each strange insistent object seemed craning forward from its place to hear him
It was I who put the stuff in the melon he said
And I dont want you to think Im sorry for it
This isnt remorse understand
Im glad the old skinflint is deadIm glad the others have their money
But mines no use to me any more
My sister married miserably and died
And Ive never had what I wanted
Ascham continued to stare then he said What on earth was your object then
Why to GET what I wantedwhat I fancied was in reach
I wanted change rest LIFE for both of uswanted above all for myself the chance to write
I travelled got back my health and came home to tie myself up to my work
And Ive slaved at it steadily for ten years without rewardwithout the most distant hope of success
Nobody will look at my stuff
And now Im fifty and Im beaten and I know it
His chin dropped forward on his breast
I want to chuck the whole business he ended
III It was after midnight when Ascham left
His hand on Granices shoulder as he turned to goDistrict Attorney be hanged see a doctor see a doctor
he had cried and so with an exaggerated laugh had pulled on his coat and departed
Granice turned back into the library
It had never occurred to him that Ascham would not believe his story
For three hours he had explained elucidated patiently and painfully gone over every detailbut without once breaking down the iron incredulity of the lawyers eye
At first Ascham had feigned to be convincedbut that as Granice now perceived was simply to get him to expose himself to entrap him into contradictions
And when the attempt failed when Granice triumphantly met and refuted each disconcerting question the lawyer dropped the mask suddenly and said with a good humoured laugh By Jove Granice youll write a successful play yet
The way youve worked this all out is a marvel
Granice swung about furiouslythat last sneer about the play inflamed him
Was all the world in a conspiracy to deride his failure
I did it I did it he muttered sullenly his rage spending itself against the impenetrable surface of the others mockery and Ascham answered with a smile Ever read any of those books on hallucination
Ive got a fairly good medicolegal library
I could send you one or two if you like


Left alone Granice cowered down in the chair before his writing table
He understood that Ascham thought him off his head
Good Godwhat if they all think me crazy
The horror of it broke out over him in a cold sweathe sat there and shook his eyes hidden in his icy hands
But gradually as he began to rehearse his story for the thousandth time he saw again how incontrovertible it was and felt sure that any criminal lawyer would believe him
Thats the troubleAschams not a criminal lawyer
And then hes a friend
What a fool I was to talk to a friend
Even if he did believe me hed never let me see ithis instinct would be to cover the whole thing up


But in that caseif he DID believe mehe might think it a kindness to get me shut up in an asylum


Granice began to tremble again
Good heaven
If he should bring in an expertone of those damned alienists
Ascham and Pettilow can do anythingtheir word always goes
If Ascham drops a hint that Id better be shut up Ill be in a straitjacket by tomorrow
And hed do it from the kindest motivesbe quite right to do it if he thinks Im a murderer
The vision froze him to his chair
He pressed his fists to his bursting temples and tried to think
For the first time he hoped that Ascham had not believed his story
But he didhe did
I can see it nowI noticed what a queer eye he cocked at me
Good God what shall I dowhat shall I do
He started up and looked at the clock
Halfpast one
What if Ascham should think the case urgent rout out an alienist and come back with him
Granice jumped to his feet and his sudden gesture brushed the morning paper from the table
Mechanically he stooped to pick it up and the movement started a new train of association
He sat down again and reached for the telephone book in the rack by his chair
Give me threeoten 


yes
The new idea in his mind had revived his flagging energy
He would actact at once
It was only by thus planning ahead committing himself to some unavoidable line of conduct that he could pull himself through the meaningless days
Each time he reached a fresh decision it was like coming out of a foggy weltering sea into a calm harbour with lights
One of the queerest phases of his long agony was the intense relief produced by these momentary lulls
That the office of the Investigator
Yes
Give me Mr Denver please


Hallo Denver


Yes Hubert Granice



Just caught you
Going straight home
Can I come and see you 


yes now 


have a talk
Its rather urgent 


yes might give you some firstrate copy



All right
He hung up the receiver with a laugh
It had been a happy thought to call up the editor of the InvestigatorRobert Denver was the very man he needed


Granice put out the lights in the libraryit was odd how the automatic gestures persistedwent into the hall put on his hat and overcoat and let himself out of the flat
In the hall a sleepy elevator boy blinked at him and then dropped his head on his folded arms
Granice passed out into the street
At the corner of Fifth Avenue he hailed a crawling cab and called out an uptown address
The long thoroughfare stretched before him dim and deserted like an ancient avenue of tombs
But from Denvers house a friendly beam fell on the pavement and as Granice sprang from his cab the editors electric turned the corner
The two men grasped hands and Denver feeling for his latchkey ushered Granice into the brightlylit hall
Disturb me
Not a bit
You might have at ten tomorrow morning 


but this is my liveliest hour 


you know my habits of old
Granice had known Robert Denver for fifteen yearswatched his rise through all the stages of journalism to the Olympian pinnacle of the Investigators editorial office
In the thick set man with grizzling hair there were few traces left of the hungryeyed young reporter who on his way home in the small hours used to bob in on Granice while the latter sat grinding at his plays
Denver had to pass Granices flat on the way to his own and it became a habit if he saw a light in the window and Granices shadow against the blind to go in smoke a pipe and discuss the universe
Wellthis is like old timesa good old habit reversed
The editor smote his visitor genially on the shoulder
Reminds me of the nights when I used to rout you out


Hows the play by the way
There IS a play I suppose
Its as safe to ask you that as to say to some men Hows the baby
Denver laughed goodnaturedly and Granice thought how thick and heavy he had grown
It was evident even to Granices tortured nerves that the words had not been uttered in maliceand the fact gave him a new measure of his insignificance
Denver did not even know that he had been a failure
The fact hurt more than Aschams irony
Come income in
The editor led the way into a small cheerful room where there were cigars and decanters
He pushed an arm chair toward his visitor and dropped into another with a comfortable groan
Now thenhelp yourself
And lets hear all about it
He beamed at Granice over his pipebowl and the latter lighting his cigar said to himself Success makes men comfortable but it makes them stupid
Then he turned and began Denver I want to tell you The clock ticked rhythmically on the mantelpiece
The little room was gradually filled with drifting blue layers of smoke and through them the editors face came and went like the moon through a moving sky
Once the hour struckthen the rhythmical ticking began again
The atmosphere grew denser and heavier and beads of perspiration began to roll from Granices forehead
Do you mind if I open the window
No
It IS stuffy in here
WaitIll do it myself
Denver pushed down the upper sash and returned to his chair
Wellgo on he said filling another pipe
His composure exasperated Granice
Theres no use in my going on if you dont believe me
The editor remained unmoved
Who says I dont believe you
And how can I tell till youve finished
Granice went on ashamed of his outburst
It was simple enough as youll see
From the day the old man said to me Those Italians would murder you for a quarter I dropped everything and just worked at my scheme
It struck me at once that I must find a way of getting to Wrenfield and back in a nightand that led to the idea of a motor
A motorthat never occurred to you
You wonder where I got the money I suppose
Well I had a thousand or so put by and I nosed around till I found what I wanteda secondhand racer
I knew how to drive a car and I tried the thing and found it was all right
Times were bad and I bought it for my price and stored it away
Where
Why in one of those noquestionsasked garages where they keep motors that are not for family use
I had a lively cousin who had put me up to that dodge and I looked about till I found a queer hole where they took in my car like a baby in a foundling asylum


Then I practiced running to Wrenfield and back in a night
I knew the way pretty well for Id done it often with the same lively cousinand in the small hours too
The distance is over ninety miles and on the third trial I did it under two hours
But my arms were so lame that I could hardly get dressed the next morning


Well then came the report about the Italians threats and I saw I must act at once


I meant to break into the old mans room shoot him and get away again
It was a big risk but I thought I could manage it
Then we heard that he was illthat thered been a consultation
Perhaps the fates were going to do it for me
Good Lord if that could only be



Granice stopped and wiped his forehead the open window did not seem to have cooled the room
Then came word that he was better and the day after when I came up from my office I found Kate laughing over the news that he was to try a bit of melon
The housekeeper had just telephoned herall Wrenfield was in a flutter
The doctor himself had picked out the melon one of the little French ones that are hardly bigger than a large tomatoand the patient was to eat it at his breakfast the next morning
In a flash I saw my chance
It was a bare chance no more
But I knew the ways of the houseI was sure the melon would be brought in over night and put in the pantry icebox
If there were only one melon in the icebox I could be fairly sure it was the one I wanted
Melons didnt lie around loose in that house every one was known numbered catalogued
The old man was beset by the dread that the servants would eat them and he took a hundred mean precautions to prevent it
Yes I felt pretty sure of my melon 


and poisoning was much safer than shooting
It would have been the devil and all to get into the old mans bedroom without his rousing the house but I ought to be able to break into the pantry without much trouble
It was a cloudy night tooeverything served me
I dined quietly and sat down at my desk
Kate had one of her usual headaches and went to bed early
As soon as she was gone I slipped out
I had got together a sort of disguisered beard and queerlooking ulster
I shoved them into a bag and went round to the garage
There was no one there but a halfdrunken machinist whom Id never seen before
That served me too
They were always changing machinists and this new fellow didnt even bother to ask if the car belonged to me
It was a very easy going place


Well I jumped in ran up Broadway and let the car go as soon as I was out of Harlem
Dark as it was I could trust myself to strike a sharp pace
In the shadow of a wood I stopped a second and got into the beard and ulster
Then away againit was just eleventhirty when I got to Wrenfield
I left the car in a dark lane behind the Lenman place and slipped through the kitchengarden
The melonhouses winked at me through the darkI remember thinking that they knew what I wanted to know



By the stable a dog came out growlingbut he nosed me out jumped on me and went back


The house was as dark as the grave
I knew everybody went to bed by ten
But there might be a prowling servantthe kitchenmaid might have come down to let in her Italian
I had to risk that of course
I crept around by the back door and hid in the shrubbery
Then I listened
It was all as silent as death
I crossed over to the house pried open the pantry window and climbed in
I had a little electric lamp in my pocket and shielding it with my cap I groped my way to the icebox opened itand there was the little French melon 


only one
I stopped to listenI was quite cool
Then I pulled out my bottle of stuff and my syringe and gave each section of the melon a hypodermic
It was all done inside of three minutesat ten minutes to twelve I was back in the car
I got out of the lane as quietly as I could struck a back road that skirted the village and let the car out as soon as I was beyond the last houses
I only stopped once on the way in to drop the beard and ulster into a pond
I had a big stone ready to weight them with and they went down plump like a dead bodyand at two oclock I was back at my desk
Granice stopped speaking and looked across the smokefumes at his listener but Denvers face remained inscrutable
At length he said Why did you want to tell me this
The question startled Granice
He was about to explain as he had explained to Ascham but suddenly it occurred to him that if his motive had not seemed convincing to the lawyer it would carry much less weight with Denver
Both were successful men and success does not understand the subtle agony of failure
Granice cast about for another reason
Why Ithe thing haunts me 


remorse I suppose youd call it


Denver struck the ashes from his empty pipe
Remorse
Bosh
he said energetically
Granices heart sank
You dont believe inREMORSE
Not an atom in the man of action
The mere fact of your talking of remorse proves to me that youre not the man to have planned and put through such a job
Granice groaned
WellI lied to you about remorse
Ive never felt any
Denvers lips tightened sceptically about his freshlyfilled pipe
What was your motive then
You must have had one
Ill tell you And Granice began again to rehearse the story of his failure of his loathing for life
Dont say you dont believe me this time 


that this isnt a real reason
he stammered out piteously as he ended
Denver meditated
No I wont say that
Ive seen too many queer things
Theres always a reason for wanting to get out of lifethe wonder is that we find so many for staying in
Granices heart grew light
Then you DO believe me
he faltered
Believe that youre sick of the job
Yes
And that you havent the nerve to pull the trigger
Oh yesthats easy enough too
But all that doesnt make you a murdererthough I dont say it proves you could never have been one
I HAVE been one DenverI swear to you
Perhaps
He meditated
Just tell me one or two things
Oh go ahead
You wont stump me
Granice heard himself say with a laugh
Wellhow did you make all those trial trips without exciting your sisters curiosity
I knew your night habits pretty well at that time remember
You were very seldom out late
Didnt the change in your ways surprise her
No because she was away at the time
She went to pay several visits in the country soon after we came back from Wrenfield and was only in town for a night or two beforebefore I did the job
And that night she went to bed early with a headache
Yesblinding
She didnt know anything when she had that kind
And her room was at the back of the flat
Denver again meditated
And when you got backshe didnt hear you
You got in without her knowing it
Yes
I went straight to my worktook it up at the word where Id left offWHY DENVER DONT YOU REMEMBER
Granice suddenly passionately interjected
Remember
Yes how you found mewhen you looked in that morning between two and three 


your usual hour 


Yes the editor nodded
Granice gave a short laugh
In my old coatwith my pipe looked as if Id been working all night didnt I
Well I hadnt been in my chair ten minutes
Denver uncrossed his legs and then crossed them again
I didnt know whether YOU remembered that
What
My coming in that particular nightor morning
Granice swung round in his chair
Why man alive
Thats why Im here now
Because it was you who spoke for me at the inquest when they looked round to see what all the old mans heirs had been doing that nightyou who testified to having dropped in and found me at my desk as usual



I thought THAT would appeal to your journalistic sense if nothing else would
Denver smiled
Oh my journalistic sense is still susceptible enoughand the ideas picturesque I grant you asking the man who proved your alibi to establish your guilt
Thats itthats it
Granices laugh had a ring of triumph
Well but how about the other chaps testimonyI mean that young doctor what was his name
Ned Ranney
Dont you remember my testifying that Id met him at the elevated station and told him I was on my way to smoke a pipe with you and his saying All right youll find him in
I passed the house two hours ago and saw his shadow against the blind as usual
And the lady with the toothache in the flat across the way she corroborated his statement you remember
Yes I remember
Well then
Simple enough
Before starting I rigged up a kind of mannikin with old coats and a cushionsomething to cast a shadow on the blind
All you fellows were used to seeing my shadow there in the small hoursI counted on that and knew youd take any vague outline as mine
Simple enough as you say
But the woman with the toothache saw the shadow moveyou remember she said she saw you sink forward as if youd fallen asleep
Yes and she was right
It DID move
I suppose some extra heavy dray must have jolted by the flimsy buildingat any rate something gave my mannikin a jar and when I came back he had sunk forward half over the table
There was a long silence between the two men
Granice with a throbbing heart watched Denver refill his pipe
The editor at any rate did not sneer and flout him
After all journalism gave a deeper insight than the law into the fantastic possibilities of life prepared one better to allow for the incalculableness of human impulses
Well
Granice faltered out
Denver stood up with a shrug
Look here manwhats wrong with you
Make a clean breast of it
Nerves gone to smash
Id like to take you to see a chap I knowan exprizefighterwhos a wonder at pulling fellows in your state out of their hole Oh oh Granice broke in
He stood up also and the two men eyed each other
You dont believe me then
This yarnhow can I
There wasnt a flaw in your alibi
But havent I filled it full of them now
Denver shook his head
I might think so if I hadnt happened to know that you WANTED to
Theres the hitch dont you see
Granice groaned
No I didnt
You mean my wanting to be found guilty
Of course
If somebody else had accused you the story might have been worth looking into
As it is a child could have invented it
It doesnt do much credit to your ingenuity
Granice turned sullenly toward the door
What was the use of arguing
But on the threshold a sudden impulse drew him back
Look here DenverI daresay youre right
But will you do just one thing to prove it
Put my statement in the Investigator just as Ive made it
Ridicule it as much as you like
Only give the other fellows a chance at itmen who dont know anything about me
Set them talking and looking about
I dont care a damn whether YOU believe mewhat I want is to convince the Grand Jury
I oughtnt to have come to a man who knows me your cursed incredulity is infectious
I dont put my case well because I know in advance its discredited and I almost end by not believing it myself
Thats why I cant convince YOU
Its a vicious circle
He laid a hand on Denvers arm
Send a stenographer and put my statement in the paper
But Denver did not warm to the idea
My dear fellow you seem to forget that all the evidence was pretty thoroughly sifted at the time every possible clue followed up
The public would have been ready enough then to believe that you murdered old Lenman you or anybody else
All they wanted was a murdererthe most improbable would have served
But your alibi was too confoundedly complete
And nothing youve told me has shaken it
Denver laid his cool hand over the others burning fingers
Look here old fellow go home and work up a better casethen come in and submit it to the Investigator
IV The perspiration was rolling off Granices forehead
Every few minutes he had to draw out his handkerchief and wipe the moisture from his haggard face
For an hour and a half he had been talking steadily putting his case to the District Attorney
Luckily he had a speaking acquaintance with Allonby and had obtained without much difficulty a private audience on the very day after his talk with Robert Denver
In the interval between he had hurried home got out of his evening clothes and gone forth again at once into the dreary dawn
His fear of Ascham and the alienist made it impossible for him to remain in his rooms
And it seemed to him that the only way of averting that hideous peril was by establishing in some sane impartial mind the proof of his guilt
Even if he had not been so incurably sick of life the electric chair seemed now the only alternative to the strait jacket
As he paused to wipe his forehead he saw the District Attorney glance at his watch
The gesture was significant and Granice lifted an appealing hand
I dont expect you to believe me now but cant you put me under arrest and have the thing looked into
Allonby smiled faintly under his heavy grayish moustache
He had a ruddy face full and jovial in which his keen professional eyes seemed to keep watch over impulses not strictly professional
Well I dont know that we need lock you up just yet
But of course Im bound to look into your statement Granice rose with an exquisite sense of relief
Surely Allonby wouldnt have said that if he hadnt believed him
Thats all right
Then I neednt detain you
I can be found at any time at my apartment
He gave the address
The District Attorney smiled again more openly
What do you say to leaving it for an hour or two this evening
Im giving a little supper at Rectorsquiet little affair you understand just Miss MelroseI think you know herand a friend or two and if youll join us


Granice stumbled out of the office without knowing what reply he had made
He waited for four daysfour days of concentrated horror
During the first twentyfour hours the fear of Aschams alienist dogged him and as that subsided it was replaced by the exasperating sense that his avowal had made no impression on the District Attorney
Evidently if he had been going to look into the case Allonby would have been heard from before now



And that mocking invitation to supper showed clearly enough how little the story had impressed him
Granice was overcome by the futility of any farther attempt to inculpate himself
He was chained to lifea prisoner of consciousness
Where was it he had read the phrase
Well he was learning what it meant
In the glaring nighthours when his brain seemed ablaze he was visited by a sense of his fixed identity of his irreducible inexpugnable SELFNESS keener more insidious more unescapable than any sensation he had ever known
He had not guessed that the mind was capable of such intricacies of selfrealization of penetrating so deep into its own dark windings
Often he woke from his brief snatches of sleep with the feeling that something material was clinging to him was on his hands and face and in his throatand as his brain cleared he understood that it was the sense of his own loathed personality that stuck to him like some thick viscous substance
Then in the first morning hours he would rise and look out of his window at the awakening activities of the streetat the streetcleaners the ashcart drivers and the other dingy workers flitting hurriedly by through the sallow winter light
Oh to be one of themany of themto take his chance in any of their skins
They were the toilersthe men whose lot was pitiedthe victims wept over and ranted about by altruists and economists and how gladly he would have taken up the load of any one of them if only he might have shaken off his own
But no the iron circle of consciousness held them too each one was handcuffed to his own hideous ego
Why wish to be any one man rather than another
The only absolute good was not to be 


And Flint coming in to draw his bath would ask if he preferred his eggs scrambled or poached that morning
On the fifth day he wrote a long urgent letter to Allonby and for the succeeding two days he had the occupation of waiting for an answer
He hardly stirred from his rooms in his fear of missing the letter by a moment but would the District Attorney write or send a representative a policeman a secret agent or some other mysterious emissary of the law
On the third morning Flint stepping softlyas if confound it
his master were illentered the library where Granice sat behind an unread newspaper and proferred a card on a tray
Granice read the nameJ
B Hewsonand underneath in pencil From the District Attorneys office
He started up with a thumping heart and signed an assent to the servant
Mr Hewson was a slight sallow nondescript man of about fifty the kind of man of whom one is sure to see a specimen in any crowd
Just the type of the successful detective Granice reflected as he shook hands with his visitor
And it was in that character that Mr Hewson briefly introduced himself
He had been sent by the District Attorney to have a quiet talk with Mr Graniceto ask him to repeat the statement he had made about the Lenman murder
His manner was so quiet so reasonable and receptive that Granices selfconfidence returned
Here was a sensible mana man who knew his businessit would be easy enough to make HIM see through that ridiculous alibi
Granice offered Mr Hewson a cigar and lighting one himselfto prove his coolnessbegan again to tell his story
He was conscious as he proceeded of telling it better than ever before
Practice helped no doubt and his listeners detached impartial attitude helped still more
He could see that Hewson at least had not decided in advance to disbelieve him and the sense of being trusted made him more lucid and more consecutive
Yes this time his words would certainly carry conviction


V Despairingly Granice gazed up and down the shabby street
Beside him stood a young man with bright prominent eyes a smooth but not too smoothlyshaven face and an Irish smile
The young mans nimble glance followed Granices
Sure of the number are you
he asked briskly
Oh yesit was 104
Well then the new building has swallowed it upthats certain
He tilted his head back and surveyed the halffinished front of a brick and limestone flathouse that reared its flimsy elegance above a row of tottering tenements and stables
Dead sure
he repeated
Yes said Granice discouraged
And even if I hadnt been I know the garage was just opposite Lefflers over there
He pointed across the street to a tumbledown stable with a blotched sign on which the words Livery and Boarding were still faintly discernible
The young man dashed across to the opposite pavement
Well thats somethingmay get a clue there
Lefflerssame name there anyhow
You remember that name
Yesdistinctly
Granice had felt a return of confidence since he had enlisted the interest of the Explorers smartest reporter
If there were moments when he hardly believed his own story there were others when it seemed impossible that every one should not believe it and young Peter McCarren peering listening questioning jotting down notes inspired him with an exquisite sense of security
McCarren had fastened on the case at once like a leech as he phrased itjumped at it thrilled to it and settled down to draw the last drop of fact from it and had not let go till he had
No one else had treated Granice in that wayeven Allonbys detective had not taken a single note
And though a week had elapsed since the visit of that authorized official nothing had been heard from the District Attorneys office Allonby had apparently dropped the matter again
But McCarren wasnt going to drop itnot he
He positively hung on Granices footsteps
They had spent the greater part of the previous day together and now they were off again running down clues
But at Lefflers they got none after all
Lefflers was no longer a stable
It was condemned to demolition and in the respite between sentence and execution it had become a vague place of storage a hospital for brokendown carriages and carts presided over by a bleareyed old woman who knew nothing of Floods garage across the waydid not even remember what had stood there before the new flathouse began to rise
Wellwe may run Leffler down somewhere Ive seen harder jobs done said McCarren cheerfully noting down the name
As they walked back toward Sixth Avenue he added in a less sanguine tone Id undertake now to put the thing through if you could only put me on the track of that cyanide
Granices heart sank
Yesthere was the weak spot he had felt it from the first
But he still hoped to convince McCarren that his case was strong enough without it and he urged the reporter to come back to his rooms and sum up the facts with him again
Sorry Mr Granice but Im due at the office now
Besides itd be no use till I get some fresh stuff to work on
Suppose I call you up tomorrow or next day
He plunged into a trolley and left Granice gazing desolately after him
Two days later he reappeared at the apartment a shade less jaunty in demeanor
Well Mr Granice the stars in their courses are against you as the bard says
Cant get a trace of Flood or of Leffler either
And you say you bought the motor through Flood and sold it through him too
Yes said Granice wearily
Who bought it do you know
Granice wrinkled his brows
Why Floodyes Flood himself
I sold it back to him three months later
Flood
The devil
And Ive ransacked the town for Flood
That kind of business disappears as if the earth had swallowed it
Granice discouraged kept silence
That brings us back to the poison McCarren continued his notebook out
Just go over that again will you
And Granice went over it again
It had all been so simple at the timeand he had been so clever in covering up his traces
As soon as he decided on poison he looked about for an acquaintance who manufactured chemicals and there was Jim Dawes a Harvard classmate in the dyeing businessjust the man
But at the last moment it occurred to him that suspicion might turn toward so obvious an opportunity and he decided on a more tortuous course
Another friend Carrick Venn a student of medicine whom irremediable illhealth had kept from the practice of his profession amused his leisure with experiments in physics for the exercise of which he had set up a simple laboratory
Granice had the habit of dropping in to smoke a cigar with him on Sunday afternoons and the friends generally sat in Venns workshop at the back of the old family house in Stuyvesant Square
Off this workshop was the cupboard of supplies with its row of deadly bottles
Carrick Venn was an original a man of restless curious tastes and his place on a Sunday was often full of visitors a cheerful crowd of journalists scribblers painters experimenters in divers forms of expression
Coming and going among so many it was easy enough to pass unperceived and one afternoon Granice arriving before Venn had returned home found himself alone in the workshop and quickly slipping into the cupboard transferred the drug to his pocket
But that had happened ten years ago and Venn poor fellow was long since dead of his dragging ailment
His old father was dead too the house in Stuyvesant Square had been turned into a boardinghouse and the shifting life of New York had passed its rapid sponge over every trace of their obscure little history
Even the optimistic McCarren seemed to acknowledge the hopelessness of seeking for proof in that direction
And theres the third door slammed in our faces
He shut his notebook and throwing back his head rested his bright inquisitive eyes on Granices furrowed face
Look here Mr Graniceyou see the weak spot dont you
The other made a despairing motion
I see so many
Yes but the one that weakens all the others
Why the deuce do you want this thing known
Why do you want to put your head into the noose
Granice looked at him hopelessly trying to take the measure of his quick light irreverent mind
No one so full of a cheerful animal life would believe in the craving for death as a sufficient motive and Granice racked his brain for one more convincing
But suddenly he saw the reporters face soften and melt to a naive sentimentalism
Mr Granicehas the memory of it always haunted you
Granice stared a moment and then leapt at the opening
Thats itthe memory of it 


always 


McCarren nodded vehemently
Dogged your steps eh
Wouldnt let you sleep
The time came when you HAD to make a clean breast of it
I had to
Cant you understand
The reporter struck his fist on the table
God sir
I dont suppose theres a human being with a drop of warm blood in him that cant picture the deadly horrors of remorse The Celtic imagination was aflame and Granice mutely thanked him for the word
What neither Ascham nor Denver would accept as a conceivable motive the Irish reporter seized on as the most adequate and as he said once one could find a convincing motive the difficulties of the case became so many incentives to effort
RemorseREMORSE he repeated rolling the word under his tongue with an accent that was a clue to the psychology of the popular drama and Granice perversely said to himself If I could only have struck that note I should have been running in six theatres at once
He saw that from that moment McCarrens professional zeal would be fanned by emotional curiosity and he profited by the fact to propose that they should dine together and go on afterward to some musichall or theatre
It was becoming necessary to Granice to feel himself an object of preoccupation to find himself in another mind
He took a kind of gray penumbral pleasure in riveting McCarrens attention on his case and to feign the grimaces of moral anguish became a passionately engrossing game
He had not entered a theatre for months but he sat out the meaningless performance in rigid tolerance sustained by the sense of the reporters observation
Between the acts McCarren amused him with anecdotes about the audience he knew every one by sight and could lift the curtain from every physiognomy
Granice listened indulgently
He had lost all interest in his kind but he knew that he was himself the real centre of McCarrens attention and that every word the latter spoke had an indirect bearing on his own problem
See that fellow over therethe little driedup man in the third row pulling his moustache
HIS memoirs would be worth publishing McCarren said suddenly in the last entracte
Granice following his glance recognized the detective from Allonbys office
For a moment he had the thrilling sense that he was being shadowed
Caesar if HE could talk
McCarren continued
Know who he is of course
Dr John B Stell the biggest alienist in the country Granice with a start bent again between the heads in front of him
THAT manthe fourth from the aisle
Youre mistaken
Thats not Dr
Stell
McCarren laughed
Well I guess Ive been in court enough to know Stell when I see him
He testifies in nearly all the big cases where they plead insanity
A cold shiver ran down Granices spine but he repeated obstinately Thats not Dr
Stell
Not Stell
Why man I KNOW him
Lookhere he comes
If it isnt Stell he wont speak to me
The little driedup man was moving slowly up the aisle
As he neared McCarren he made a slight gesture of recognition
Howdo Doctor Stell
Pretty slim show aint it
the reporter cheerfully flung out at him
And Mr J
B Hewson with a nod of amicable assent passed on
Granice sat benumbed
He knew he had not been mistakenthe man who had just passed was the same man whom Allonby had sent to see him a physician disguised as a detective
Allonby then had thought him insane like the othershad regarded his confession as the maundering of a maniac
The discovery froze Granice with horrorhe seemed to see the madhouse gaping for him
Isnt there a man a good deal like hima detective named J
B
Hewson
But he knew in advance what McCarrens answer would be
Hewson
J
B Hewson
Never heard of him
But that was J
B Stell fast enoughI guess he can be trusted to know himself and you saw he answered to his name
VI Some days passed before Granice could obtain a word with the District Attorney he began to think that Allonby avoided him
But when they were face to face Allonbys jovial countenance showed no sign of embarrassment
He waved his visitor to a chair and leaned across his desk with the encouraging smile of a consulting physician
Granice broke out at once That detective you sent me the other day Allonby raised a deprecating hand 
I know it was Stell the alienist
Why did you do that Allonby
The others face did not lose its composure
Because I looked up your story firstand theres nothing in it
Nothing in it
Granice furiously interposed
Absolutely nothing
If there is why the deuce dont you bring me proofs
I know youve been talking to Peter Ascham and to Denver and to that little ferret McCarren of the Explorer
Have any of them been able to make out a case for you
No
Well what am I to do
Granices lips began to tremble
Why did you play me that trick
About Stell
I had to my dear fellow its part of my business
Stell IS a detective if you come to thatevery doctor is
The trembling of Granices lips increased communicating itself in a long quiver to his facial muscles
He forced a laugh through his dry throat
Welland what did he detect
In you
Oh he thinks its overworkoverwork and too much smoking
If you look in on him some day at his office hell show you the record of hundreds of cases like yours and advise you what treatment to follow
Its one of the commonest forms of hallucination
Have a cigar all the same
But Allonby I killed that man
The District Attorneys large hand outstretched on his desk had an almost imperceptible gesture and a moment later as if an answer to the call of an electric bell a clerk looked in from the outer office
Sorry my dear fellowlot of people waiting
Drop in on Stell some morning Allonby said shaking hands
McCarren had to own himself beaten there was absolutely no flaw in the alibi
And since his duty to his journal obviously forbade his wasting time on insoluble mysteries he ceased to frequent Granice who dropped back into a deeper isolation
For a day or two after his visit to Allonby he continued to live in dread of Dr Stell
Why might not Allonby have deceived him as to the alienists diagnosis
What if he were really being shadowed not by a police agent but by a maddoctor
To have the truth out he suddenly determined to call on Dr Stell
The physician received him kindly and reverted without embarrassment to the conditions of their previous meeting
We have to do that occasionally Mr Granice its one of our methods
And you had given Allonby a fright
Granice was silent
He would have liked to reaffirm his guilt to produce the fresh arguments which had occurred to him since his last talk with the physician but he feared his eagerness might be taken for a symptom of derangement and he affected to smile away Dr Stells allusion
You think then its a case of brainfagnothing more
Nothing more
And I should advise you to knock off tobacco
You smoke a good deal dont you
He developed his treatment recommending massage gymnastics travel or any form of diversion that did notthat in short Granice interrupted him impatiently
Oh I loathe all thatand Im sick of travelling
Hm
Then some larger interestpolitics reform philanthropy
Something to take you out of yourself
Yes
I understand said Granice wearily
Above all dont lose heart
I see hundreds of cases like yours the doctor added cheerfully from the threshold
On the doorstep Granice stood still and laughed
Hundreds of cases like histhe case of a man who had committed a murder who confessed his guilt and whom no one would believe
Why there had never been a case like it in the world
What a good figure Stell would have made in a play the great alienist who couldnt read a mans mind any better than that
Granice saw huge comic opportunities in the type
But as he walked away his fears dispelled the sense of listlessness returned on him
For the first time since his avowal to Peter Ascham he found himself without an occupation and understood that he had been carried through the past weeks only by the necessity of constant action
Now his life had once more become a stagnant backwater and as he stood on the street corner watching the tides of traffic sweep by he asked himself despairingly how much longer he could endure to float about in the sluggish circle of his consciousness
The thought of selfdestruction recurred to him but again his flesh recoiled
He yearned for death from other hands but he could never take it from his own
And aside from his insuperable physical reluctance another motive restrained him
He was possessed by the dogged desire to establish the truth of his story
He refused to be swept aside as an irresponsible dreamereven if he had to kill himself in the end he would not do so before proving to society that he had deserved death from it
He began to write long letters to the papers but after the first had been published and commented on public curiosity was quelled by a brief statement from the District Attorneys office and the rest of his communications remained unprinted
Ascham came to see him and begged him to travel
Robert Denver dropped in and tried to joke him out of his delusion till Granice mistrustful of their motives began to dread the reappearance of Dr Stell and set a guard on his lips
But the words he kept back engendered others and still others in his brain
His inner self became a humming factory of arguments and he spent long hours reciting and writing down elaborate statements of his crime which he constantly retouched and developed
Then gradually his activity languished under the lack of an audience the sense of being buried beneath deepening drifts of indifference
In a passion of resentment he swore that he would prove himself a murderer even if he had to commit another crime to do it and for a sleepless night or two the thought flamed red on his darkness
But daylight dispelled it
The determining impulse was lacking and he hated too promiscuously to choose his victim


So he was thrown back on the unavailing struggle to impose the truth of his story
As fast as one channel closed on him he tried to pierce another through the sliding sands of incredulity
But every issue seemed blocked and the whole human race leagued together to cheat one man of the right to die
Thus viewed the situation became so monstrous that he lost his last shred of selfrestraint in contemplating it
What if he were really the victim of some mocking experiment the centre of a ring of holidaymakers jeering at a poor creature in its blind dashes against the solid walls of consciousness
But nomen were not so uniformly cruel there were flaws in the close surface of their indifference cracks of weakness and pity here and there


Granice began to think that his mistake lay in having appealed to persons more or less familiar with his past and to whom the visible conformities of his life seemed a final disproof of its one fierce secret deviation
The general tendency was to take for the whole of life the slit seen between the blinders of habit and in his walk down that narrow vista Granice cut a correct enough figure
To a vision free to follow his whole orbit his story would be more intelligible it would be easier to convince a chance idler in the street than the trained intelligence hampered by a sense of his antecedents
This idea shot up in him with the tropic luxuriance of each new seed of thought and he began to walk the streets and to frequent out oftheway chophouses and bars in his search for the impartial stranger to whom he should disclose himself
At first every face looked encouragement but at the crucial moment he always held back
So much was at stake and it was so essential that his first choice should be decisive
He dreaded stupidity timidity intolerance
The imaginative eye the furrowed brow were what he sought
He must reveal himself only to a heart versed in the tortuous motions of the human will and he began to hate the dull benevolence of the average face
Once or twice obscurely allusively he made a beginningonce sitting down at a mans side in a basement chophouse another day approaching a lounger on an eastside wharf
But in both cases the premonition of failure checked him on the brink of avowal
His dread of being taken for a man in the clutch of a fixed idea gave him an unnatural keenness in reading the expression of his interlocutors and he had provided himself in advance with a series of verbal alternatives trapdoors of evasion from the first dart of ridicule or suspicion
He passed the greater part of the day in the streets coming home at irregular hours dreading the silence and orderliness of his apartment and the critical scrutiny of Flint
His real life was spent in a world so remote from this familiar setting that he sometimes had the mysterious sense of a living metempsychosis a furtive passage from one identity to anotheryet the other as unescapably himself
One humiliation he was spared the desire to live never revived in him
Not for a moment was he tempted to a shabby pact with existing conditions
He wanted to die wanted it with the fixed unwavering desire which alone attains its end
And still the end eluded him
It would not always of coursehe had full faith in the dark star of his destiny
And he could prove it best by repeating his story persistently and indefatigably pouring it into indifferent ears hammering it into dull brains till at last it kindled a spark and some one of the careless millions paused listened believed


It was a mild March day and he had been loitering on the west side docks looking at faces
He was becoming an expert in physiognomies his eagerness no longer made rash darts and awkward recoils
He knew now the face he needed as clearly as if it had come to him in a vision and not till he found it would he speak
As he walked eastward through the shabby reeking streets he had a premonition that he should find it that morning
Perhaps it was the promise of spring in the aircertainly he felt calmer than for many days


He turned into Washington Square struck across it obliquely and walked up University Place
Its heterogeneous passers always allured himthey were less hurried than in Broadway less enclosed and classified than in Fifth Avenue
He walked slowly watching for his face
At Union Square he felt a sudden relapse into discouragement like a votary who has watched too long for a sign from the altar
Perhaps after all he should never find his face


The air was languid and he felt tired
He walked between the bald grassplots and the twisted trees making for an empty seat
Presently he passed a bench on which a girl sat alone and something as definite as the twitch of a cord made him stop before her
He had never dreamed of telling his story to a girl had hardly looked at the womens faces as they passed
His case was mans work how could a woman help him
But this girls face was extraordinaryquiet and wide as a clear evening sky
It suggested a hundred images of space distance mystery like ships he had seen as a boy quietly berthed by a familiar wharf but with the breath of far seas and strange harbours in their shrouds


Certainly this girl would understand
He went up to her quietly lifting his hat observing the formswishing her to see at once that he was a gentleman
I am a stranger to you he began sitting down beside her but your face is so extremely intelligent that I feel


I feel it is the face Ive waited for 


looked for everywhere and I want to tell you The girls eyes widened she rose to her feet
She was escaping him
In his dismay he ran a few steps after her and caught her roughly by the arm
Herewaitlisten
Oh dont scream you fool
he shouted out
He felt a hand on his own arm turned and confronted a policeman
Instantly he understood that he was being arrested and something hard within him was loosened and ran to tears
Ah you knowyou KNOW Im guilty
He was conscious that a crowd was forming and that the girls frightened face had disappeared
But what did he care about her face
It was the policeman who had really understood him
He turned and followed the crowd at his heels


VII In the charming place in which he found himself there were so many sympathetic faces that he felt more than ever convinced of the certainty of making himself heard
It was a bad blow at first to find that he had not been arrested for murder but Ascham who had come to him at once explained that he needed rest and the time to review his statements it appeared that reiteration had made them a little confused and contradictory
To this end he had willingly acquiesced in his removal to a large quiet establishment with an open space and trees about it where he had found a number of intelligent companions some like himself engaged in preparing or reviewing statements of their cases and others ready to lend an interested ear to his own recital
For a time he was content to let himself go on the tranquil current of this existence but although his auditors gave him for the most part an encouraging attention which in some went the length of really brilliant and helpful suggestion he gradually felt a recurrence of his old doubts
Either his hearers were not sincere or else they had less power to aid him than they boasted
His interminable conferences resulted in nothing and as the benefit of the long rest made itself felt it produced an increased mental lucidity which rendered inaction more and more unbearable
At length he discovered that on certain days visitors from the outer world were admitted to his retreat and he wrote out long and logically constructed relations of his crime and furtively slipped them into the hands of these messengers of hope
This occupation gave him a fresh lease of patience and he now lived only to watch for the visitors days and scan the faces that swept by him like stars seen and lost in the rifts of a hurrying sky
Mostly these faces were strange and less intelligent than those of his companions
But they represented his last means of access to the world a kind of subterranean channel on which he could set his statements afloat like paper boats which the mysterious current might sweep out into the open seas of life
One day however his attention was arrested by a familiar contour a pair of bright prominent eyes and a chin insufficiently shaved
He sprang up and stood in the path of Peter McCarren
The journalist looked at him doubtfully then held out his hand with a startled deprecating WHY
You didnt know me
Im so changed
Granice faltered feeling the rebound of the others wonder
Why no but youre looking quietersmoothed out McCarren smiled
Yes thats what Im here forto rest
And Ive taken the opportunity to write out a clearer statement Granices hand shook so that he could hardly draw the folded paper from his pocket
As he did so he noticed that the reporter was accompanied by a tall man with grave compassionate eyes
It came to Granice in a wild thrill of conviction that this was the face he had waited for


Perhaps your friendhe IS your friendwould glance over it or I could put the case in a few words if you have time
Granices voice shook like his hand
If this chance escaped him he felt that his last hope was gone
McCarren and the stranger looked at each other and the former glanced at his watch
Im sorry we cant stay and talk it over now Mr Granice but my friend has an engagement and were rather pressed Granice continued to proffer the paper
Im sorryI think I could have explained
But youll take this at any rate
The stranger looked at him gently
CertainlyIll take it
He had his hand out
Goodbye
Goodbye Granice echoed
He stood watching the two men move away from him through the long light hall and as he watched them a tear ran down his face
But as soon as they were out of sight he turned and walked hastily toward his room beginning to hope again already planning a new statement
Outside the building the two men stood still and the journalists companion looked up curiously at the long monotonous rows of barred windows
So that was Granice
Yesthat was Granice poor devil said McCarren
Strange case
I suppose theres never been one just like it
Hes still absolutely convinced that he committed that murder
Absolutely
Yes
The stranger reflected
And there was no conceivable ground for the idea
No one could make out how it started
A quiet conventional sort of fellow like thatwhere do you suppose he got such a delusion
Did you ever get the least clue to it
McCarren stood still his hands in his pockets his head cocked up in contemplation of the barred windows
Then he turned his bright hard gaze on his companion
That was the queer part of it
Ive never spoken of itbut I DID get a clue
By Jove
Thats interesting
What was it
McCarren formed his red lips into a whistle
Whythat it wasnt a delusion
He produced his effectthe other turned on him with a pallid stare
He murdered the man all right
I tumbled on the truth by the merest accident when Id pretty nearly chucked the whole job
He murdered himmurdered his cousin
Sure as you live
Only dont split on me
Its about the queerest business I ever ran into


DO ABOUT IT
Why what was I to do
I couldnt hang the poor devil could I
Lord but I was glad when they collared him and had him stowed away safe in there
The tall man listened with a grave face grasping Granices statement in his hand
Heretake this it makes me sick he said abruptly thrusting the paper at the reporter and the two men turned and walked in silence to the gates
The End THE DILETTANTE as first published in Harpers Monthly December 1903 It was on an impulse hardly needing the arguments he found himself advancing in its favor that Thursdale on his way to the club turned as usual into Mrs Vervains street
The as usual was his own qualification of the act a convenient way of bridging the intervalin days and other sequencesthat lay between this visit and the last
It was characteristic of him that he instinctively excluded his call two days earlier with Ruth Gaynor from the list of his visits to Mrs Vervain the special conditions attending it had made it no more like a visit to Mrs Vervain than an engraved dinner invitation is like a personal letter
Yet it was to talk over his call with Miss Gaynor that he was now returning to the scene of that episode and it was because Mrs Vervain could be trusted to handle the talking over as skilfully as the interview itself that at her corner he had felt the dilettantes irresistible craving to take a last look at a work of art that was passing out of his possession
On the whole he knew no one better fitted to deal with the unexpected than Mrs Vervain
She excelled in the rare art of taking things for granted and Thursdale felt a pardonable pride in the thought that she owed her excellence to his training
Early in his career Thursdale had made the mistake at the outset of his acquaintance with a lady of telling her that he loved her and exacting the same avowal in return
The latter part of that episode had been like the long walk back from a picnic when one has to carry all the crockery one has finished using it was the last time Thursdale ever allowed himself to be encumbered with the debris of a feast
He thus incidentally learned that the privilege of loving her is one of the least favors that a charming woman can accord and in seeking to avoid the pitfalls of sentiment he had developed a science of evasion in which the woman of the moment became a mere implement of the game
He owed a great deal of delicate enjoyment to the cultivation of this art
The perils from which it had been his refuge became naively harmless was it possible that he who now took his easy way along the levels had once preferred to gasp on the raw heights of emotion
Youth is a highcolored season but he had the satisfaction of feeling that he had entered earlier than most into that chiaroscuro of sensation where every halftone has its value
As a promoter of this pleasure no one he had known was comparable to Mrs Vervain
He had taught a good many women not to betray their feelings but he had never before had such fine material to work in
She had been surprisingly crude when he first knew her capable of making the most awkward inferences of plunging through thin ice of recklessly undressing her emotions but she had acquired under the discipline of his reticences and evasions a skill almost equal to his own and perhaps more remarkable in that it involved keeping time with any tune he played and reading at sight some uncommonly difficult passages
It had taken Thursdale seven years to form this fine talent but the result justified the effort
At the crucial moment she had been perfect her way of greeting Miss Gaynor had made him regret that he had announced his engagement by letter
It was an evasion that confessed a difficulty a deviation implying an obstacle where by common consent it was agreed to see none it betrayed in short a lack of confidence in the completeness of his method
It had been his pride never to put himself in a position which had to be quitted as it were by the back door but here as he perceived the main portals would have opened for him of their own accord
All this and much more he read in the finished naturalness with which Mrs Vervain had met Miss Gaynor
He had never seen a better piece of work there was no over eagerness no suspicious warmth above all and this gave her art the grace of a natural quality there were none of those damnable implications whereby a woman in welcoming her friends betrothed may keep him on pins and needles while she laps the lady in complacency
So masterly a performance indeed hardly needed the offset of Miss Gaynors doorstep wordsTo be so kind to me how she must have liked you
though he caught himself wishing it lay within the bounds of fitness to transmit them as a final tribute to the one woman he knew who was unfailingly certain to enjoy a good thing
It was perhaps the one drawback to his new situation that it might develop good things which it would be impossible to hand on to Margaret Vervain
The fact that he had made the mistake of underrating his friends powers the consciousness that his writing must have betrayed his distrust of her efficiency seemed an added reason for turning down her street instead of going on to the club
He would show her that he knew how to value her he would ask her to achieve with him a feat infinitely rarer and more delicate than the one he had appeared to avoid
Incidentally he would also dispose of the interval of time before dinner ever since he had seen Miss Gaynor off an hour earlier on her return journey to Buffalo he had been wondering how he should put in the rest of the afternoon
It was absurd how he missed the girl



Yes that was it the desire to talk about her was after all at the bottom of his impulse to call on Mrs Vervain
It was absurd if you likebut it was delightfully rejuvenating
He could recall the time when he had been afraid of being obvious now he felt that this return to the primitive emotions might be as restorative as a holiday in the Canadian woods
And it was precisely by the girls candor her directness her lack of complications that he was taken
The sense that she might say something rash at any moment was positively exhilarating if she had thrown her arms about him at the station he would not have given a thought to his crumpled dignity
It surprised Thursdale to find what freshness of heart he brought to the adventure and though his sense of irony prevented his ascribing his intactness to any conscious purpose he could but rejoice in the fact that his sentimental economies had left him such a large surplus to draw upon
Mrs Vervain was at homeas usual
When one visits the cemetery one expects to find the angel on the tombstone and it struck Thursdale as another proof of his friends good taste that she had been in no undue haste to change her habits
The whole house appeared to count on his coming the footman took his hat and overcoat as naturally as though there had been no lapse in his visits and the drawingroom at once enveloped him in that atmosphere of tacit intelligence which Mrs Vervain imparted to her very furniture
It was a surprise that in this general harmony of circumstances Mrs Vervain should herself sound the first false note
You
she exclaimed and the book she held slipped from her hand
It was crude certainly unless it were a touch of the finest art
The difficulty of classifying it disturbed Thursdales balance
Why not
he said restoring the book
Isnt it my hour
And as she made no answer he added gently Unless its some one elses
She laid the book aside and sank back into her chair
Mine merely she said
I hope that doesnt mean that youre unwilling to share it
With you
By no means
Youre welcome to my last crust
He looked at her reproachfully
Do you call this the last
She smiled as he dropped into the seat across the hearth
Its a way of giving it more flavor
He returned the smile
A visit to you doesnt need such condiments
She took this with just the right measure of retrospective amusement
Ah but I want to put into this one a very special taste she confessed
Her smile was so confident so reassuring that it lulled him into the imprudence of saying Why should you want it to be different from what was always so perfectly right
She hesitated
Doesnt the fact that its the last constitute a difference
The lastmy last visit to you
Oh metaphorically I meantheres a break in the continuity
Decidedly she was pressing too hard unlearning his arts already
I dont recognize it he said
Unless you make me he added with a note that slightly stirred her attitude of languid attention
She turned to him with grave eyes
You recognize no difference whatever
Noneexcept an added link in the chain
An added link
In having one more thing to like you foryour letting Miss Gaynor see why I had already so many
He flattered himself that this turn had taken the least hint of fatuity from the phrase
Mrs Vervain sank into her former easy pose
Was it that you came for
she asked almost gaily
If it is necessary to have a reasonthat was one
To talk to me about Miss Gaynor
To tell you how she talks about you
That will be very interestingespecially if you have seen her since her second visit to me
Her second visit
Thursdale pushed his chair back with a start and moved to another
She came to see you again
This morning yesby appointment
He continued to look at her blankly
You sent for her
I didnt have toshe wrote and asked me last night
But no doubt you have seen her since
Thursdale sat silent
He was trying to separate his words from his thoughts but they still clung together inextricably
I saw her off just now at the station
And she didnt tell you that she had been here again
There was hardly time I supposethere were people about he floundered
Ah shell write then
He regained his composure
Of course shell write very often I hope
You know Im absurdly in love he cried audaciously
She tilted her head back looking up at him as he leaned against the chimneypiece
He had leaned there so often that the attitude touched a pulse which set up a throbbing in her throat
Oh my poor Thursdale
she murmured
I suppose its rather ridiculous he owned and as she remained silent he added with a sudden breakOr have you another reason for pitying me
Her answer was another question
Have you been back to your rooms since you left her
Since I left her at the station
I came straight here
Ah yesyou COULD there was no reason Her words passed into a silent musing
Thursdale moved nervously nearer
You said you had something to tell me
Perhaps I had better let her do so
There may be a letter at your rooms
A letter
What do you mean
A letter from HER
What has happened
His paleness shook her and she raised a hand of reassurance
Nothing has happenedperhaps that is just the worst of it
You always HATED you know she added incoherently to have things happen you never would let them
And now
Well that was what she came here for I supposed you had guessed
To know if anything had happened
Had happened
He gazed at her slowly
Between you and me
he said with a rush of light
The words were so much cruder than any that had ever passed between them that the color rose to her face but she held his startled gaze
You know girls are not quite as unsophisticated as they used to be
Are you surprised that such an idea should occur to her
His own color answered hers it was the only reply that came to him
Mrs Vervain went on smoothly I supposed it might have struck you that there were times when we presented that appearance
He made an impatient gesture
A mans past is his own
Perhapsit certainly never belongs to the woman who has shared it
But one learns such truths only by experience and Miss Gaynor is naturally inexperienced
Of coursebutsupposing her act a natural one he floundered lamentably among his innuendoesI still dont seehow there was anything Anything to take hold of
There wasnt Well then
escaped him in crude satisfaction but as she did not complete the sentence he went on with a faltering laugh She can hardly object to the existence of a mere friendship between us
But she does said Mrs Vervain
Thursdale stood perplexed
He had seen on the previous day no trace of jealousy or resentment in his betrothed he could still hear the candid ring of the girls praise of Mrs Vervain
If she were such an abyss of insincerity as to dissemble distrust under such frankness she must at least be more subtle than to bring her doubts to her rival for solution
The situation seemed one through which one could no longer move in a penumbra and he let in a burst of light with the direct query Wont you explain what you mean
Mrs Vervain sat silent not provokingly as though to prolong his distress but as if in the attenuated phraseology he had taught her it was difficult to find words robust enough to meet his challenge
It was the first time he had ever asked her to explain anything and she had lived so long in dread of offering elucidations which were not wanted that she seemed unable to produce one on the spot
At last she said slowly She came to find out if you were really free
Thursdale colored again
Free
he stammered with a sense of physical disgust at contact with such crassness
Yesif I had quite done with you
She smiled in recovered security
It seems she likes clear outlines she has a passion for definitions
Yeswell
he said wincing at the echo of his own subtlety
Welland when I told her that you had never belonged to me she wanted me to define MY statusto know exactly where I had stood all along
Thursdale sat gazing at her intently his hand was not yet on the clue
And even when you had told her that Even when I had told her that I had HAD no statusthat I had never stood anywhere in any sense she meant said Mrs Vervain slowlyeven then she wasnt satisfied it seems
He uttered an uneasy exclamation
She didnt believe you you mean
I mean that she DID believe me too thoroughly
Well thenin Gods name what did she want
Something morethose were the words she used
Something more
Betweenbetween you and me
Is it a conundrum
He laughed awkwardly
Girls are not what they were in my day they are no longer forbidden to contemplate the relation of the sexes
So it seems
he commented
But since in this case there wasnt any he broke off catching the dawn of a revelation in her gaze
Thats just it
The unpardonable offence has beenin our not offending
He flung himself down despairingly
I give it upWhat did you tell her
he burst out with sudden crudeness
The exact truth
If I had only known she broke off with a beseeching tenderness wont you believe that I would still have lied for you
Lied for me
Why on earth should you have lied for either of us
To save youto hide you from her to the last
As Ive hidden you from myself all these years
She stood up with a sudden tragic import in her movement
You believe me capable of that dont you
If I had only guessedbut I have never known a girl like her she had the truth out of me with a spring
The truth that you and I had never Had nevernever in all these years
Oh she knew whyshe measured us both in a flash
She didnt suspect me of having haggled with youher words pelted me like hail
He just took what he wantedsifted and sorted you to suit his taste
Burnt out the gold and left a heap of cinders
And you let himyou let yourself be cut in bitsshe mixed her metaphors a little be cut in bits and used or discarded while all the while every drop of blood in you belonged to him
But hes Shylockand you have bled to death of the pound of flesh he has cut out of you
But she despises me the most you knowfar the most Mrs Vervain ended
The words fell strangely on the scented stillness of the room they seemed out of harmony with its setting of afternoon intimacy the kind of intimacy on which at any moment a visitor might intrude without perceptibly lowering the atmosphere
It was as though a grand operasinger had strained the acoustics of a private musicroom
Thursdale stood up facing his hostess
Half the room was between them but they seemed to stare close at each other now that the veils of reticence and ambiguity had fallen
His first words were characteristic
She DOES despise me then
he exclaimed
She thinks the pound of flesh you took was a little too near the heart
He was excessively pale
Please tell me exactly what she said of me
She did not speak much of you she is proud
But I gather that while she understands love or indifference her eyes have never been opened to the many intermediate shades of feeling
At any rate she expressed an unwillingness to be taken with reservationsshe thinks you would have loved her better if you had loved some one else first
The point of view is original she insists on a man with a past
Oh a pastif shes seriousI could rake up a past
he said with a laugh
So I suggested but she has her eyes on his particular portion of it
She insists on making it a test case
She wanted to know what you had done to me and before I could guess her drift I blundered into telling her
Thursdale drew a difficult breath
I never supposedyour revenge is complete he said slowly
He heard a little gasp in her throat
My revenge
When I sent for you to warn youto save you from being surprised as I was surprised
Youre very goodbut its rather late to talk of saving me
He held out his hand in the mechanical gesture of leavetaking
How you must carefor I never saw you so dull was her answer
Dont you see that its not too late for me to help you
And as he continued to stare she brought out sublimely Take the restin imagination
Let it at least be of that much use to you
Tell her I lied to hershes too ready to believe it
And so after all in a sense I shant have been wasted
His stare hung on her widening to a kind of wonder
She gave the look back brightly unblushingly as though the expedient were too simple to need oblique approaches
It was extraordinary how a few words had swept them from an atmosphere of the most complex dissimulations to this contact of naked souls
It was not in Thursdale to expand with the pressure of fate but something in him cracked with it and the rift let in new light
He went up to his friend and took her hand
You would do ityou would do it
She looked at him smiling but her hand shook
Goodby he said kissing it
Goodby
You are going
To get my letter
Your letter
The letter wont matter if you will only do what I ask
He returned her gaze
I might I suppose without being out of character
Only dont you see that if your plan helped me it could only harm her
Harm HER
To sacrifice you wouldnt make me different
I shall go on being what I have always beensifting and sorting as she calls it
Do you want my punishment to fall on HER
She looked at him long and deeply
Ah if I had to choose between you
You would let her take her chance
But I cant you see
I must take my punishment alone
She drew her hand away sighing
Oh there will be no punishment for either of you
For either of us
There will be the reading of her letter for me
She shook her head with a slight laugh
There will be no letter
Thursdale faced about from the threshold with fresh life in his look
No letter
You dont mean I mean that shes been with you since I saw hershes seen you and heard your voice
If there IS a letter she has recalled it from the first station by telegraph
He turned back to the door forcing an answer to her smile
But in the mean while I shall have read it he said
The door closed on him and she hid her eyes from the dreadful emptiness of the room
The End THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD HAND as first published in Atlantic Monthly August 1904 I Above all the letter ended dont leave Siena without seeing Doctor Lombards Leonardo
Lombard is a queer old Englishman a mystic or a madman if the two are not synonymous and a devout student of the Italian Renaissance
He has lived for years in Italy exploring its remotest corners and has lately picked up an undoubted Leonardo which came to light in a farmhouse near Bergamo
It is believed to be one of the missing pictures mentioned by Vasari and is at any rate according to the most competent authorities a genuine and almost untouched example of the best period
Lombard is a queer stick and jealous of showing his treasures but we struck up a friendship when I was working on the Sodomas in Siena three years ago and if you will give him the enclosed line you may get a peep at the Leonardo
Probably not more than a peep though for I hear he refuses to have it reproduced
I want badly to use it in my monograph on the Windsor drawings so please see what you can do for me and if you cant persuade him to let you take a photograph or make a sketch at least jot down a detailed description of the picture and get from him all the facts you can
I hear that the French and Italian governments have offered him a large advance on his purchase but that he refuses to sell at any price though he certainly cant afford such luxuries in fact I dont see where he got enough money to buy the picture
He lives in the Via Papa Giulio
Wyant sat at the table dhote of his hotel rereading his friends letter over a late luncheon
He had been five days in Siena without having found time to call on Doctor Lombard not from any indifference to the opportunity presented but because it was his first visit to the strange red city and he was still under the spell of its more conspicuous wondersthe brick palaces flinging out their wroughtiron torchholders with a gesture of arrogant suzerainty the great councilchamber emblazoned with civic allegories the pageant of Pope Julius on the Library walls the Sodomas smiling balefully through the dusk of mouldering chapelsand it was only when his first hunger was appeased that he remembered that one course in the banquet was still untasted
He put the letter in his pocket and turned to leave the room with a nod to its only other occupant an oliveskinned young man with lustrous eyes and a low collar who sat on the other side of the table perusing the Fanfulla di Domenica
This gentleman his daily visavis returned the nod with a Latin eloquence of gesture and Wyant passed on to the antechamber where he paused to light a cigarette
He was just restoring the case to his pocket when he heard a hurried step behind him and the lustrous eyed young man advanced through the glass doors of the dining room
Pardon me sir he said in measured English and with an intonation of exquisite politeness you have let this letter fall
Wyant recognizing his friends note of introduction to Doctor Lombard took it with a word of thanks and was about to turn away when he perceived that the eyes of his fellow diner remained fixed on him with a gaze of melancholy interrogation
Again pardon me the young man at length ventured but are you by chance the friend of the illustrious Doctor Lombard
No returned Wyant with the instinctive AngloSaxon distrust of foreign advances
Then fearing to appear rude he said with a guarded politeness Perhaps by the way you can tell me the number of his house
I see it is not given here
The young man brightened perceptibly
The number of the house is thirteen but any one can indicate it to youit is well known in Siena
It is called he continued after a moment the House of the Dead Hand
Wyant stared
What a queer name
he said
The name comes from an antique hand of marble which for many hundred years has been above the door
Wyant was turning away with a gesture of thanks when the other added If you would have the kindness to ring twice
To ring twice
At the doctors
The young man smiled
It is the custom
It was a dazzling March afternoon with a shower of sun from the midblue and a marshalling of slaty clouds behind the umber colored hills
For nearly an hour Wyant loitered on the Lizza watching the shadows race across the naked landscape and the thunder blacken in the west then he decided to set out for the House of the Dead Hand
The map in his guidebook showed him that the Via Papa Giulio was one of the streets which radiate from the Piazza and thither he bent his course pausing at every other step to fill his eye with some fresh image of weatherbeaten beauty
The clouds had rolled upward obscuring the sunshine and hanging like a funereal baldachin above the projecting cornices of Doctor Lombards street and Wyant walked for some distance in the shade of the beetling palace fronts before his eye fell on a doorway surmounted by a sallow marble hand
He stood for a moment staring up at the strange emblem
The hand was a womans a dead drooping hand which hung there convulsed and helpless as though it had been thrust forth in denunciation of some evil mystery within the house and had sunk struggling into death
A girl who was drawing water from the well in the court said that the English doctor lived on the first floor and Wyant passing through a glazed door mounted the damp degrees of a vaulted stairway with a plaster AEsculapius mouldering in a niche on the landing
Facing the AEsculapius was another door and as Wyant put his hand on the bellrope he remembered his unknown friends injunction and rang twice
His ring was answered by a peasant woman with a low forehead and small closeset eyes who after a prolonged scrutiny of himself his card and his letter of introduction left him standing in a high cold antechamber floored with brick
He heard her wooden pattens click down an interminable corridor and after some delay she returned and told him to follow her
They passed through a long saloon bare as the antechamber but loftily vaulted and frescoed with a seventeenthcentury Triumph of Scipio or Alexandermartial figures following Wyant with the filmed melancholy gaze of shades in limbo
At the end of this apartment he was admitted to a smaller room with the same atmosphere of mortal cold but showing more obvious signs of occupancy
The walls were covered with tapestry which had faded to the graybrown tints of decaying vegetation so that the young man felt as though he were entering a sunless autumn wood
Against these hangings stood a few tall cabinets on heavy gilt feet and at a table in the window three persons were seated an elderly lady who was warming her hands over a brazier a girl bent above a strip of needlework and an old man
As the latter advanced toward Wyant the young man was conscious of staring with unseemly intentness at his small roundbacked figure dressed with shabby disorder and surmounted by a wonderful head lean vulpine eaglebeaked as that of some art loving despot of the Renaissance a head combining the venerable hair and large prominent eyes of the humanist with the greedy profile of the adventurer
Wyant in musing on the Italian portraitmedals of the fifteenth century had often fancied that only in that period of fierce individualism could types so paradoxical have been produced yet the subtle craftsmen who committed them to the bronze had never drawn a face more strangely stamped with contradictory passions than that of Doctor Lombard
I am glad to see you he said to Wyant extending a hand which seemed a mere framework held together by knotted veins
We lead a quiet life here and receive few visitors but any friend of Professor Clydes is welcome
Then with a gesture which included the two women he added dryly My wife and daughter often talk of Professor Clyde
Oh yeshe used to make me such nice toast they dont understand toast in Italy said Mrs Lombard in a high plaintive voice
It would have been difficult from Doctor Lombards manner and appearance to guess his nationality but his wife was so inconsciently and ineradicably English that even the silhouette of her cap seemed a protest against Continental laxities
She was a stout fair woman with pale cheeks netted with red lines
A brooch with a miniature portrait sustained a bogwood watch chain upon her bosom and at her elbow lay a heap of knitting and an old copy of The Queen
The young girl who had remained standing was a slim replica of her mother with an applecheeked face and opaque blue eyes
Her small head was prodigally laden with braids of dull fair hair and she might have had a kind of transient prettiness but for the sullen droop of her round mouth
It was hard to say whether her expression implied illtemper or apathy but Wyant was struck by the contrast between the fierce vitality of the doctors age and the inanimateness of his daughters youth
Seating himself in the chair which his host advanced the young man tried to open the conversation by addressing to Mrs Lombard some random remark on the beauties of Siena
The lady murmured a resigned assent and Doctor Lombard interposed with a smile My dear sir my wife considers Siena a most salubrious spot and is favorably impressed by the cheapness of the marketing but she deplores the total absence of muffins and cannel coal and cannot resign herself to the Italian method of dusting furniture
But they dont you knowthey dont dust it
Mrs Lombard protested without showing any resentment of her husbands manner
Preciselythey dont dust it
Since we have lived in Siena we have not once seen the cobwebs removed from the battlements of the Mangia
Can you conceive of such housekeeping
My wife has never yet dared to write it home to her aunts at Bonchurch
Mrs Lombard accepted in silence this remarkable statement of her views and her husband with a malicious smile at Wyants embarrassment planted himself suddenly before the young man
And now said he do you want to see my Leonardo
DO I
cried Wyant on his feet in a flash
The doctor chuckled
Ah he said with a kind of crooning deliberation thats the way they all behavethats what they all come for
He turned to his daughter with another variation of mockery in his smile
Dont fancy its for your beaux yeux my dear or for the mature charms of Mrs Lombard he added glaring suddenly at his wife who had taken up her knitting and was softly murmuring over the number of her stitches
Neither lady appeared to notice his pleasantries and he continued addressing himself to Wyant They all comethey all come but many are called and few are chosen
His voice sank to solemnity
While I live he said no unworthy eye shall desecrate that picture
But I will not do my friend Clyde the injustice to suppose that he would send an unworthy representative
He tells me he wishes a description of the picture for his book and you shall describe it to himif you can
Wyant hesitated not knowing whether it was a propitious moment to put in his appeal for a photograph
Well sir he said you know Clyde wants me to take away all I can of it
Doctor Lombard eyed him sardonically
Youre welcome to take away all you can carry he replied adding as he turned to his daughter That is if he has your permission Sybilla
The girl rose without a word and laying aside her work took a key from a secret drawer in one of the cabinets while the doctor continued in the same note of grim jocularity For you must know that the picture is not mineit is my daughters
He followed with evident amusement the surprised glance which Wyant turned on the young girls impassive figure
Sybilla he pursued is a votary of the arts she has inherited her fond fathers passion for the unattainable
Luckily however she also recently inherited a tidy legacy from her grandmother and having seen the Leonardo on which its discoverer had placed a price far beyond my reach she took a step which deserves to go down to history she invested her whole inheritance in the purchase of the picture thus enabling me to spend my closing years in communion with one of the worlds masterpieces
My dear sir could Antigone do more
The object of this strange eulogy had meanwhile drawn aside one of the tapestry hangings and fitted her key into a concealed door
Come said Doctor Lombard let us go before the light fails us
Wyant glanced at Mrs Lombard who continued to knit impassively
No no said his host my wife will not come with us
You might not suspect it from her conversation but my wife has no feeling for artItalian art that is for no one is fonder of our early Victorian school
Friths Railway Station you know said Mrs Lombard smiling
I like an animated picture
Miss Lombard who had unlocked the door held back the tapestry to let her father and Wyant pass out then she followed them down a narrow stone passage with another door at its end
This door was ironbarred and Wyant noticed that it had a complicated patent lock
The girl fitted another key into the lock and Doctor Lombard led the way into a small room
The dark panelling of this apartment was irradiated by streams of yellow light slanting through the disbanded thunder clouds and in the central brightness hung a picture concealed by a curtain of faded velvet
A little too bright Sybilla said Doctor Lombard
His face had grown solemn and his mouth twitched nervously as his daughter drew a linen drapery across the upper part of the window
That will dothat will do
He turned impressively to Wyant
Do you see the pomegranate bud in this rug
Place yourself therekeep your left foot on it please
And now Sybilla draw the cord
Miss Lombard advanced and placed her hand on a cord hidden behind the velvet curtain
Ah said the doctor one moment I should like you while looking at the picture to have in mind a few lines of verse
Sybilla Without the slightest change of countenance and with a promptness which proved her to be prepared for the request Miss Lombard began to recite in a full round voice like her mothers St Bernards invocation to the Virgin in the thirtythird canto of the Paradise
Thank you my dear said her father drawing a deep breath as she ended
That unapproachable combination of vowel sounds prepares one better than anything I know for the contemplation of the picture
As he spoke the folds of velvet slowly parted and the Leonardo appeared in its frame of tarnished gold From the nature of Miss Lombards recitation Wyant had expected a sacred subject and his surprise was therefore great as the composition was gradually revealed by the widening division of the curtain
In the background a steelcolored river wound through a pale calcareous landscape while to the left on a lonely peak a crucified Christ hung livid against indigo clouds
The central figure of the foreground however was that of a woman seated in an antique chair of marble with basreliefs of dancing maenads
Her feet rested on a meadow sprinkled with minute wildflowers and her attitude of smiling majesty recalled that of Dosso Dossis Circe
She wore a red robe flowing in closely fluted lines from under a fancifully embroidered cloak
Above her high forehead the crinkled golden hair flowed sideways beneath a veil one hand drooped on the arm of her chair the other held up an inverted human skull into which a young Dionysus smooth brown and sidelong as the St John of the Louvre poured a stream of wine from a highpoised flagon
At the ladys feet lay the symbols of art and luxury a flute and a roll of music a platter heaped with grapes and roses the torso of a Greek statuette and a bowl overflowing with coins and jewels behind her on the chalky hilltop hung the crucified Christ
A scroll in a corner of the foreground bore the legend Lux Mundi
Wyant emerging from the first plunge of wonder turned inquiringly toward his companions
Neither had moved
Miss Lombard stood with her hand on the cord her lids lowered her mouth drooping the doctor his strange Thothlike profile turned toward his guest was still lost in rapt contemplation of his treasure
Wyant addressed the young girl
You are fortunate he said to be the possessor of anything so perfect
It is considered very beautiful she said coldly
BeautifulBEAUTIFUL
the doctor burst out
Ah the poor worn out overworked word
There are no adjectives in the language fresh enough to describe such pristine brilliancy all their brightness has been worn off by misuse
Think of the things that have been called beautiful and then look at THAT
It is worthy of a new vocabulary Wyant agreed
Yes Doctor Lombard continued my daughter is indeed fortunate
She has chosen what Catholics call the higher life the counsel of perfection
What other private person enjoys the same opportunity of understanding the master
Who else lives under the same roof with an untouched masterpiece of Leonardos
Think of the happiness of being always under the influence of such a creation of living INTO it of partaking of it in daily and hourly communion
This room is a chapel the sight of that picture is a sacrament
What an atmosphere for a young life to unfold itself in
My daughter is singularly blessed
Sybilla point out some of the details to Mr Wyant I see that he will appreciate them
The girl turned her dense blue eyes toward Wyant then glancing away from him she pointed to the canvas
Notice the modeling of the left hand she began in a monotonous voice it recalls the hand of the Mona Lisa
The head of the naked genius will remind you of that of the St John of the Louvre but it is more purely pagan and is turned a little less to the right
The embroidery on the cloak is symbolic you will see that the roots of this plant have burst through the vase
This recalls the famous definition of Hamlets character in Wilhelm Meister
Here are the mystic rose the flame and the serpent emblem of eternity
Some of the other symbols we have not yet been able to decipher
Wyant watched her curiously she seemed to be reciting a lesson
And the picture itself
he said
How do you explain that
Lux Mundiwhat a curious device to connect with such a subject
What can it mean
Miss Lombard dropped her eyes the answer was evidently not included in her lesson
What indeed
the doctor interposed
What does life mean
As one may define it in a hundred different ways so one may find a hundred different meanings in this picture
Its symbolism is as manyfaceted as a wellcut diamond
Who for instance is that divine lady
Is it she who is the true Lux Mundithe light reflected from jewels and young eyes from polished marble and clear waters and statues of bronze
Or is that the Light of the World extinguished on yonder stormy hill and is this lady the Pride of Life feasting blindly on the wine of iniquity with her back turned to the light which has shone for her in vain
Something of both these meanings may be traced in the picture but to me it symbolizes rather the central truth of existence that all that is raised in incorruption is sown in corruption art beauty love religion that all our wine is drunk out of skulls and poured for us by the mysterious genius of a remote and cruel past
The doctors face blazed his bent figure seemed to straighten itself and become taller
Ah he cried growing more dithyrambic how lightly you ask what it means
How confidently you expect an answer
Yet here am I who have given my life to the study of the Renaissance who have violated its tomb laid open its dead body and traced the course of every muscle bone and artery who have sucked its very soul from the pages of poets and humanists who have wept and believed with Joachim of Flora smiled and doubted with AEneas Sylvius Piccolomini who have patiently followed to its source the least inspiration of the masters and groped in neolithic caverns and Babylonian ruins for the first unfolding tendrils of the arabesques of Mantegna and Crivelli and I tell you that I stand abashed and ignorant before the mystery of this picture
It means nothingit means all things
It may represent the period which saw its creation it may represent all ages past and to come
There are volumes of meaning in the tiniest emblem on the ladys cloak the blossoms of its border are rooted in the deepest soil of myth and tradition
Dont ask what it means young man but bow your head in thankfulness for having seen it
Miss Lombard laid her hand on his arm
Dont excite yourself father she said in the detached tone of a professional nurse
He answered with a despairing gesture
Ah its easy for you to talk
You have years and years to spend with it I am an old man and every moment counts
Its bad for you she repeated with gentle obstinacy
The doctors sacred fury had in fact burnt itself out
He dropped into a seat with dull eyes and slackening lips and his daughter drew the curtain across the picture
Wyant turned away reluctantly
He felt that his opportunity was slipping from him yet he dared not refer to Clydes wish for a photograph
He now understood the meaning of the laugh with which Doctor Lombard had given him leave to carry away all the details he could remember
The picture was so dazzling so unexpected so crossed with elusive and contradictory suggestions that the most alert observer when placed suddenly before it must lose his coordinating faculty in a sense of confused wonder
Yet how valuable to Clyde the record of such a work would be
In some ways it seemed to be the summing up of the masters thought the key to his enigmatic philosophy
The doctor had risen and was walking slowly toward the door
His daughter unlocked it and Wyant followed them back in silence to the room in which they had left Mrs Lombard
That lady was no longer there and he could think of no excuse for lingering
He thanked the doctor and turned to Miss Lombard who stood in the middle of the room as though awaiting farther orders
It is very good of you he said to allow one even a glimpse of such a treasure
She looked at him with her odd directness
You will come again
she said quickly and turning to her father she added You know what Professor Clyde asked
This gentleman cannot give him any account of the picture without seeing it again
Doctor Lombard glanced at her vaguely he was still like a person in a trance
Eh
he said rousing himself with an effort
I said father that Mr Wyant must see the picture again if he is to tell Professor Clyde about it Miss Lombard repeated with extraordinary precision of tone
Wyant was silent
He had the puzzled sense that his wishes were being divined and gratified for reasons with which he was in no way connected
Well well the doctor muttered I dont say noI dont say no
I know what Clyde wantsI dont refuse to help him
He turned to Wyant
You may come againyou may make notes he added with a sudden effort
Jot down what occurs to you
Im willing to concede that
Wyant again caught the girls eye but its emphatic message perplexed him
Youre very good he said tentatively but the fact is the picture is so mysteriousso full of complicated detailthat Im afraid no notes I could make would serve Clydes purpose as well asas a photograph say
If you would allow me Miss Lombards brow darkened and her father raised his head furiously
A photograph
A photograph did you say
Good God man not ten people have been allowed to set foot in that room
A PHOTOGRAPH
Wyant saw his mistake but saw also that he had gone too far to retreat
I know sir from what Clyde has told me that you object to having any reproduction of the picture published but he hoped you might let me take a photograph for his personal usenot to be reproduced in his book but simply to give him something to work by
I should take the photograph myself and the negative would of course be yours
If you wished it only one impression would be struck off and that one Clyde could return to you when he had done with it
Doctor Lombard interrupted him with a snarl
When he had done with it
Just so I thank thee for that word
When it had been rephotographed drawn traced autotyped passed about from hand to hand defiled by every ignorant eye in England vulgarized by the blundering praise of every artscribbler in Europe
Bah
Id as soon give you the picture itself why dont you ask for that
Well sir said Wyant calmly if you will trust me with it Ill engage to take it safely to England and back and to let no eye but Clydes see it while it is out of your keeping
The doctor received this remarkable proposal in silence then he burst into a laugh
Upon my soul
he said with sardonic good humor
It was Miss Lombards turn to look perplexedly at Wyant
His last words and her fathers unexpected reply had evidently carried her beyond her depth
Well sir am I to take the picture
Wyant smilingly pursued
No young man nor a photograph of it
Nor a sketch either mind thatnothing that can be reproduced
Sybilla he cried with sudden passion swear to me that the picture shall never be reproduced
No photograph no sketchnow or afterward
Do you hear me
Yes father said the girl quietly
The vandals he muttered the desecrators of beauty if I thought it would ever get into their hands Id burn it first by God
He turned to Wyant speaking more quietly
I said you might come backI never retract what I say
But you must give me your word that no one but Clyde shall see the notes you make
Wyant was growing warm
If you wont trust me with a photograph I wonder you trust me not to show my notes
he exclaimed
The doctor looked at him with a malicious smile
Humph
he said would they be of much use to anybody
Wyant saw that he was losing ground and controlled his impatience
To Clyde I hope at any rate he answered holding out his hand
The doctor shook it without a trace of resentment and Wyant added When shall I come sir
Tomorrowtomorrow morning cried Miss Lombard speaking suddenly
She looked fixedly at her father and he shrugged his shoulders
The picture is hers he said to Wyant
In the antechamber the young man was met by the woman who had admitted him
She handed him his hat and stick and turned to unbar the door
As the bolt slipped back he felt a touch on his arm
You have a letter
she said in a low tone
A letter
He stared
What letter
She shrugged her shoulders and drew back to let him pass
II As Wyant emerged from the house he paused once more to glance up at its scarred brick facade
The marble hand drooped tragically above the entrance in the waning light it seemed to have relaxed into the passiveness of despair and Wyant stood musing on its hidden meaning
But the Dead Hand was not the only mysterious thing about Doctor Lombards house
What were the relations between Miss Lombard and her father
Above all between Miss Lombard and her picture
She did not look like a person capable of a disinterested passion for the arts and there had been moments when it struck Wyant that she hated the picture
The sky at the end of the street was flooded with turbulent yellow light and the young man turned his steps toward the church of San Domenico in the hope of catching the lingering brightness on Sodomas St Catherine
The great bare aisles were almost dark when he entered and he had to grope his way to the chapel steps
Under the momentary evocation of the sunset the saints figure emerged pale and swooning from the dusk and the warm light gave a sensual tinge to her ecstasy
The flesh seemed to glow and heave the eyelids to tremble Wyant stood fascinated by the accidental collaboration of light and color
Suddenly he noticed that something white had fluttered to the ground at his feet
He stooped and picked up a small thin sheet of notepaper folded and sealed like an oldfashioned letter and bearing the superscription To the Count Ottaviano Celsi
Wyant stared at this mysterious document
Where had it come from
He was distinctly conscious of having seen it fall through the air close to his feet
He glanced up at the dark ceiling of the chapel then he turned and looked about the church
There was only one figure in it that of a man who knelt near the high altar
Suddenly Wyant recalled the question of Doctor Lombards maid servant
Was this the letter she had asked for
Had he been unconsciously carrying it about with him all the afternoon
Who was Count Ottaviano Celsi and how came Wyant to have been chosen to act as that noblemans ambulant letterbox
Wyant laid his hat and stick on the chapel steps and began to explore his pockets in the irrational hope of finding there some clue to the mystery but they held nothing which he had not himself put there and he was reduced to wondering how the letter supposing some unknown hand to have bestowed it on him had happened to fall out while he stood motionless before the picture
At this point he was disturbed by a step on the floor of the aisle and turning he saw his lustrouseyed neighbor of the table dhote
The young man bowed and waved an apologetic hand
I do not intrude
he inquired suavely
Without waiting for a reply he mounted the steps of the chapel glancing about him with the affable air of an afternoon caller
I see he remarked with a smile that you know the hour at which our saint should be visited
Wyant agreed that the hour was indeed felicitous
The stranger stood beamingly before the picture
What grace
What poetry
he murmured apostrophizing the St Catherine but letting his glance slip rapidly about the chapel as he spoke
Wyant detecting the manoeuvre murmured a brief assent
But it is cold heremortally cold you do not find it so
The intruder put on his hat
It is permitted at this hourwhen the church is empty
And you my dear sirdo you not feel the dampness
You are an artist are you not
And to artists it is permitted to cover the head when they are engaged in the study of the paintings
He darted suddenly toward the steps and bent over Wyants hat
Permit mecover yourself
he said a moment later holding out the hat with an ingratiating gesture
A light flashed on Wyant
Perhaps he said looking straight at the young man you will tell me your name
My own is Wyant
The stranger surprised but not disconcerted drew forth a coroneted card which he offered with a low bow
On the card was engraved Il Conte Ottaviano Celsi
I am much obliged to you said Wyant and I may as well tell you that the letter which you apparently expected to find in the lining of my hat is not there but in my pocket
He drew it out and handed it to its owner who had grown very pale
And now Wyant continued you will perhaps be good enough to tell me what all this means
There was no mistaking the effect produced on Count Ottaviano by this request
His lips moved but he achieved only an ineffectual smile
I suppose you know Wyant went on his anger rising at the sight of the others discomfiture that you have taken an unwarrantable liberty
I dont yet understand what part I have been made to play but its evident that you have made use of me to serve some purpose of your own and I propose to know the reason why
Count Ottaviano advanced with an imploring gesture
Sir he pleaded you permit me to speak
I expect you to cried Wyant
But not here he added hearing the clank of the vergers keys
It is growing dark and we shall be turned out in a few minutes
He walked across the church and Count Ottaviano followed him out into the deserted square
Now said Wyant pausing on the steps
The Count who had regained some measure of selfpossession began to speak in a high key with an accompaniment of conciliatory gesture
My dear sirmy dear Mr Wyantyou find me in an abominable positionthat as a man of honor I immediately confess
I have taken advantage of youyes
I have counted on your amiability your chivalrytoo far perhaps
I confess it
But what could I do
It was to oblige a ladyhe laid a hand on his hearta lady whom I would die to serve
He went on with increasing volubility his deliberate English swept away by a torrent of Italian through which Wyant with some difficulty struggled to a comprehension of the case
Count Ottaviano according to his own statement had come to Siena some months previously on business connected with his mothers property the paternal estate being near Orvieto of which ancient city his father was syndic
Soon after his arrival in Siena the young Count had met the incomparable daughter of Doctor Lombard and falling deeply in love with her had prevailed on his parents to ask her hand in marriage
Doctor Lombard had not opposed his suit but when the question of settlements arose it became known that Miss Lombard who was possessed of a small property in her own right had a short time before invested the whole amount in the purchase of the Bergamo Leonardo
Thereupon Count Ottavianos parents had politely suggested that she should sell the picture and thus recover her independence and this proposal being met by a curt refusal from Doctor Lombard they had withdrawn their consent to their sons marriage
The young ladys attitude had hitherto been one of passive submission she was horribly afraid of her father and would never venture openly to oppose him but she had made known to Ottaviano her intention of not giving him up of waiting patiently till events should take a more favorable turn
She seemed hardly aware the Count said with a sigh that the means of escape lay in her own hands that she was of age and had a right to sell the picture and to marry without asking her fathers consent
Meanwhile her suitor spared no pains to keep himself before her to remind her that he too was waiting and would never give her up
Doctor Lombard who suspected the young man of trying to persuade Sybilla to sell the picture had forbidden the lovers to meet or to correspond they were thus driven to clandestine communication and had several times the Count ingenuously avowed made use of the doctors visitors as a means of exchanging letters
And you told the visitors to ring twice
Wyant interposed
The young man extended his hands in a deprecating gesture
Could Mr Wyant blame him
He was young he was ardent he was enamored
The young lady had done him the supreme honor of avowing her attachment of pledging her unalterable fidelity should he suffer his devotion to be outdone
But his purpose in writing to her he admitted was not merely to reiterate his fidelity he was trying by every means in his power to induce her to sell the picture
He had organized a plan of action every detail was complete if she would but have the courage to carry out his instructions he would answer for the result
His idea was that she should secretly retire to a convent of which his aunt was the Mother Superior and from that stronghold should transact the sale of the Leonardo
He had a purchaser ready who was willing to pay a large sum a sum Count Ottaviano whispered considerably in excess of the young ladys original inheritance once the picture sold it could if necessary be removed by force from Doctor Lombards house and his daughter being safely in the convent would be spared the painful scenes incidental to the removal
Finally if Doctor Lombard were vindictive enough to refuse his consent to her marriage she had only to make a sommation respectueuse and at the end of the prescribed delay no power on earth could prevent her becoming the wife of Count Ottaviano
Wyants anger had fallen at the recital of this simple romance
It was absurd to be angry with a young man who confided his secrets to the first stranger he met in the streets and placed his hand on his heart whenever he mentioned the name of his betrothed
The easiest way out of the business was to take it as a joke
Wyant had played the wall to this new Pyramus and Thisbe and was philosophic enough to laugh at the part he had unwittingly performed
He held out his hand with a smile to Count Ottaviano
I wont deprive you any longer he said of the pleasure of reading your letter
Oh sir a thousand thanks
And when you return to the casa Lombard you will take a message from methe letter she expected this afternoon
The letter she expected
Wyant paused
No thank you
I thought you understood that where I come from we dont do that kind of thingknowingly
But sir to serve a young lady
Im sorry for the young lady if what you tell me is truethe Counts expressive hands resented the doubtbut remember that if I am under obligations to any one in this matter it is to her father who has admitted me to his house and has allowed me to see his picture
HIS picture
Hers
Well the house is his at all events
Unhappilysince to her it is a dungeon
Why doesnt she leave it then
exclaimed Wyant impatiently
The Count clasped his hands
Ah how you say thatwith what force with what virility
If you would but say it to HER in that toneyou her countryman
She has no one to advise her the mother is an idiot the father is terrible she is in his power it is my belief that he would kill her if she resisted him
Mr Wyant I tremble for her life while she remains in that house
Oh come said Wyant lightly they seem to understand each other well enough
But in any case you must see that I cant interfereat least you would if you were an Englishman he added with an escape of contempt
III Wyants affiliations in Siena being restricted to an acquaintance with his landlady he was forced to apply to her for the verification of Count Ottavianos story
The young nobleman had it appeared given a perfectly correct account of his situation
His father Count CelsiMongirone was a man of distinguished family and some wealth
He was syndic of Orvieto and lived either in that town or on his neighboring estate of Mongirone
His wife owned a large property near Siena and Count Ottaviano who was the second son came there from time to time to look into its management
The eldest son was in the army the youngest in the Church and an aunt of Count Ottavianos was Mother Superior of the Visitandine convent in Siena
At one time it had been said that Count Ottaviano who was a most amiable and accomplished young man was to marry the daughter of the strange Englishman Doctor Lombard but difficulties having arisen as to the adjustment of the young ladys dower Count CelsiMongirone had very properly broken off the match
It was sad for the young man however who was said to be deeply in love and to find frequent excuses for coming to Siena to inspect his mothers estate
Viewed in the light of Count Ottavianos personality the story had a tinge of opera bouffe but the next morning as Wyant mounted the stairs of the House of the Dead Hand the situation insensibly assumed another aspect
It was impossible to take Doctor Lombard lightly and there was a suggestion of fatality in the appearance of his gaunt dwelling
Who could tell amid what tragic records of domestic tyranny and fluttering broken purposes the little drama of Miss Lombards fate was being played out
Might not the accumulated influences of such a house modify the lives within it in a manner unguessed by the inmates of a suburban villa with sanitary plumbing and a telephone
One person at least remained unperturbed by such fanciful problems and that was Mrs Lombard who at Wyants entrance raised a placidly wrinkled brow from her knitting
The morning was mild and her chair had been wheeled into a bar of sunshine near the window so that she made a cheerful spot of prose in the poetic gloom of her surroundings
What a nice morning
she said it must be delightful weather at Bonchurch
Her dull blue glance wandered across the narrow street with its threatening house fronts and fluttered back baffled like a bird with clipped wings
It was evident poor lady that she had never seen beyond the opposite houses
Wyant was not sorry to find her alone
Seeing that she was surprised at his reappearance he said at once I have come back to study Miss Lombards picture
Oh the picture Mrs Lombards face expressed a gentle disappointment which might have been boredom in a person of acuter sensibilities
Its an original Leonardo you know she said mechanically
And Miss Lombard is very proud of it I suppose
She seems to have inherited her fathers love for art
Mrs Lombard counted her stitches and he went on Its unusual in so young a girl
Such tastes generally develop later
Mrs Lombard looked up eagerly
Thats what I say
I was quite different at her age you know
I liked dancing and doing a pretty bit of fancywork
Not that I couldnt sketch too I had a master down from London
My aunts have some of my crayons hung up in their drawingroom nowI did a view of Kenilworth which was thought pleasing
But I liked a picnic too or a pretty walk through the woods with young people of my own age
I say its more natural Mr Wyant one may have a feeling for art and do crayons that are worth framing and yet not give up everything else
I was taught that there were other things
Wyant halfashamed of provoking these innocent confidences could not resist another question
And Miss Lombard cares for nothing else
Her mother looked troubled
Sybilla is so clevershe says I dont understand
You know how selfconfident young people are
My husband never said that of me nowhe knows I had an excellent education
My aunts were very particular I was brought up to have opinions and my husband has always respected them
He says himself that he wouldnt for the world miss hearing my opinion on any subject you may have noticed that he often refers to my tastes
He has always respected my preference for living in England he likes to hear me give my reasons for it
He is so much interested in my ideas that he often says he knows just what I am going to say before I speak
But Sybilla does not care for what I think At this point Doctor Lombard entered
He glanced sharply at Wyant
The servant is a fool she didnt tell me you were here
His eye turned to his wife
Well my dear what have you been telling Mr Wyant
About the aunts at Bonchurch Ill be bound
Mrs Lombard looked triumphantly at Wyant and her husband rubbed his hooked fingers with a smile
Mrs Lombards aunts are very superior women
They subscribe to the circulating library and borrow Good Words and the Monthly Packet from the curates wife across the way
They have the rector to tea twice a year and keep a pageboy and are visited by two baronets wives
They devoted themselves to the education of their orphan niece and I think I may say without boasting that Mrs Lombards conversation shows marked traces of the advantages she enjoyed
Mrs Lombard colored with pleasure
I was telling Mr Wyant that my aunts were very particular
Quite so my dear and did you mention that they never sleep in anything but linen and that Miss Sophia puts away the furs and blankets every spring with her own hands
Both those facts are interesting to the student of human nature
Doctor Lombard glanced at his watch
But we are missing an incomparable moment the light is perfect at this hour
Wyant rose and the doctor led him through the tapestried door and down the passageway
The light was in fact perfect and the picture shone with an inner radiancy as though a lamp burned behind the soft screen of the ladys flesh
Every detail of the foreground detached itself with jewellike precision
Wyant noticed a dozen accessories which had escaped him on the previous day
He drew out his notebook and the doctor who had dropped his sardonic grin for a look of devout contemplation pushed a chair forward and seated himself on a carved settle against the wall
Now then he said tell Clyde what you can but the letter killeth
He sank down his hands hanging on the arm of the settle like the claws of a dead bird his eyes fixed on Wyants notebook with the obvious intention of detecting any attempt at a surreptitious sketch
Wyant nettled at this surveillance and disturbed by the speculations which Doctor Lombards strange household excited sat motionless for a few minutes staring first at the picture and then at the blank pages of the notebook
The thought that Doctor Lombard was enjoying his discomfiture at length roused him and he began to write
He was interrupted by a knock on the iron door
Doctor Lombard rose to unlock it and his daughter entered
She bowed hurriedly to Wyant without looking at him
Father had you forgotten that the man from Monte Amiato was to come back this morning with an answer about the basrelief
He is here now he says he cant wait
The devil
cried her father impatiently
Didnt you tell him Yes but he says he cant come back
If you want to see him you must come now
Then you think theres a chance She nodded
He turned and looked at Wyant who was writing assiduously
You will stay here Sybilla I shall be back in a moment
He hurried out locking the door behind him
Wyant had looked up wondering if Miss Lombard would show any surprise at being locked in with him but it was his turn to be surprised for hardly had they heard the key withdrawn when she moved close to him her small face pale and tumultuous
I arranged itI must speak to you she gasped
Hell be back in five minutes
Her courage seemed to fail and she looked at him helplessly
Wyant had a sense of stepping among explosives
He glanced about him at the dusky vaulted room at the haunting smile of the strange picture overhead and at the pinkandwhite girl whispering of conspiracies in a voice meant to exchange platitudes with a curate
How can I help you
he said with a rush of compassion
Oh if you would
I never have a chance to speak to any one its so difficulthe watches mehell be back immediately
Try to tell me what I can do
I dont dare I feel as if he were behind me
She turned away fixing her eyes on the picture
A sound startled her
There he comes and I havent spoken
It was my only chance but it bewilders me so to be hurried
I dont hear any one said Wyant listening
Try to tell me
How can I make you understand
It would take so long to explain
She drew a deep breath and then with a plungeWill you come here again this afternoonat about five
she whispered
Come here again
Yesyou can ask to see the picturemake some excuse
He will come with you of course I will open the door for youandand lock you both inshe gasped
Lock us in
You see
You understand
Its the only way for me to leave the houseif I am ever to do it She drew another difficult breath
The key will be returnedby a safe personin half an hourperhaps sooner She trembled so much that she was obliged to lean against the settle for support
Wyant looked at her steadily he was very sorry for her
I cant Miss Lombard he said at length
You cant
Im sorry I must seem cruel but consider He was stopped by the futility of the word as well ask a hunted rabbit to pause in its dash for a hole
Wyant took her hand it was cold and nerveless
I will serve you in any way I can but you must see that this way is impossible
Cant I talk to you again
Perhaps Oh she cried starting up there he comes
Doctor Lombards step sounded in the passage
Wyant held her fast
Tell me one thing he wont let you sell the picture
Nohush
Make no pledges for the future then promise me that
The future
In case he should die your father is an old man
You havent promised
She shook her head
Dont then remember that
She made no answer and the key turned in the lock
As he passed out of the house its scowling cornice and facade of ravaged brick looked down on him with the startlingness of a strange face seen momentarily in a crowd and impressing itself on the brain as part of an inevitable future
Above the doorway the marble hand reached out like the cry of an imprisoned anguish
Wyant turned away impatiently
Rubbish
he said to himself
SHE isnt walled in she can get out if she wants to
IV Wyant had any number of plans for coming to Miss Lombards aid he was elaborating the twentieth when on the same afternoon he stepped into the express train for Florence
By the time the train reached Certaldo he was convinced that in thus hastening his departure he had followed the only reasonable course at Empoli he began to reflect that the priest and the Levite had probably justified themselves in much the same manner
A month later after his return to England he was unexpectedly relieved from these alternatives of extenuation and approval
A paragraph in the morning paper announced the sudden death of Doctor Lombard the distinguished English dilettante who had long resided in Siena
Wyants justification was complete
Our blindest impulses become evidence of perspicacity when they fall in with the course of events
Wyant could now comfortably speculate on the particular complications from which his foresight had probably saved him
The climax was unexpectedly dramatic
Miss Lombard on the brink of a step which whatever its issue would have burdened her with retrospective compunction had been set free before her suitors ardor could have had time to cool and was now doubtless planning a life of domestic felicity on the proceeds of the Leonardo
One thing however struck Wyant as oddhe saw no mention of the sale of the picture
He had scanned the papers for an immediate announcement of its transfer to one of the great museums but presently concluding that Miss Lombard out of filial piety had wished to avoid an appearance of unseemly haste in the disposal of her treasure he dismissed the matter from his mind
Other affairs happened to engage him the months slipped by and gradually the lady and the picture dwelt less vividly in his mind
It was not till five or six years later when chance took him again to Siena that the recollection started from some inner fold of memory
He found himself as it happened at the head of Doctor Lombards street and glancing down that grim thoroughfare caught an oblique glimpse of the doctors house front with the Dead Hand projecting above its threshold
The sight revived his interest and that evening over an admirable frittata he questioned his landlady about Miss Lombards marriage
The daughter of the English doctor
But she has never married signore
Never married
What then became of Count Ottaviano
For a long time he waited but last year he married a noble lady of the Maremma
But what happenedwhy was the marriage broken
The landlady enacted a pantomime of baffled interrogation
And Miss Lombard still lives in her fathers house
Yes signore she is still there
And the Leonardo The Leonardo also is still there
The next day as Wyant entered the House of the Dead Hand he remembered Count Ottavianos injunction to ring twice and smiled mournfully to think that so much subtlety had been vain
But what could have prevented the marriage
If Doctor Lombards death had been long delayed time might have acted as a dissolvent or the young ladys resolve have failed but it seemed impossible that the white heat of ardor in which Wyant had left the lovers should have cooled in a few short weeks
As he ascended the vaulted stairway the atmosphere of the place seemed a reply to his conjectures
The same numbing air fell on him like an emanation from some persistent willpower a something fierce and imminent which might reduce to impotence every impulse within its range
Wyant could almost fancy a hand on his shoulder guiding him upward with the ironical intent of confronting him with the evidence of its work
A strange servant opened the door and he was presently introduced to the tapestried room where from their usual seats in the window Mrs Lombard and her daughter advanced to welcome him with faint ejaculations of surprise
Both had grown oddly old but in a dry smooth way as fruits might shrivel on a shelf instead of ripening on the tree
Mrs Lombard was still knitting and pausing now and then to warm her swollen hands above the brazier and Miss Lombard in rising had laid aside a strip of needlework which might have been the same on which Wyant had first seen her engaged
Their visitor inquired discreetly how they had fared in the interval and learned that they had thought of returning to England but had somehow never done so
I am sorry not to see my aunts again Mrs Lombard said resignedly but Sybilla thinks it best that we should not go this year
Next year perhaps murmured Miss Lombard in a voice which seemed to suggest that they had a great waste of time to fill
She had returned to her seat and sat bending over her work
Her hair enveloped her head in the same thick braids but the rose color of her cheeks had turned to blotches of dull red like some pigment which has darkened in drying
And Professor Clydeis he well
Mrs Lombard asked affably continuing as her daughter raised a startled eye Surely Sybilla Mr Wyant was the gentleman who was sent by Professor Clyde to see the Leonardo
Miss Lombard was silent but Wyant hastened to assure the elder lady of his friends wellbeing
Ahperhaps then he will come back some day to Siena she said sighing
Wyant declared that it was more than likely and there ensued a pause which he presently broke by saying to Miss Lombard And you still have the picture
She raised her eyes and looked at him
Should you like to see it
she asked
On his assenting she rose and extracting the same key from the same secret drawer unlocked the door beneath the tapestry
They walked down the passage in silence and she stood aside with a grave gesture making Wyant pass before her into the room
Then she crossed over and drew the curtain back from the picture
The light of the early afternoon poured full on it its surface appeared to ripple and heave with a fluid splendor
The colors had lost none of their warmth the outlines none of their pure precision it seemed to Wyant like some magical flower which had burst suddenly from the mould of darkness and oblivion
He turned to Miss Lombard with a movement of comprehension
Ah I understandyou couldnt part with it after all
he cried
NoI couldnt part with it she answered
Its too beautifultoo beautifulhe assented
Too beautiful
She turned on him with a curious stare
I have never thought it beautiful you know
He gave back the stare
You have never She shook her head
Its not that
I hate it Ive always hated it
But he wouldnt let mehe will never let me now
Wyant was startled by her use of the present tense
Her look surprised him too there was a strange fixity of resentment in her innocuous eye
Was it possible that she was laboring under some delusion
Or did the pronoun not refer to her father
You mean that Doctor Lombard did not wish you to part with the picture
Nohe prevented me he will always prevent me
There was another pause
You promised him then before his death No I promised nothing
He died too suddenly to make me
Her voice sank to a whisper
I was freeperfectly freeor I thought I was till I tried
Till you tried
To disobey himto sell the picture
Then I found it was impossible
I tried again and again but he was always in the room with me
She glanced over her shoulder as though she had heard a step and to Wyant too for a moment the room seemed full of a third presence
And you canthe faltered unconsciously dropping his voice to the pitch of hers
She shook her head gazing at him mystically
I cant lock him out I can never lock him out now
I told you I should never have another chance
Wyant felt the chill of her words like a cold breath in his hair
Ohhe groaned but she cut him off with a grave gesture
It is too late she said but you ought to have helped me that day
